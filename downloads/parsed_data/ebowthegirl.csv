it's a lovely temperate day in minneapolis.
i'm sitting at a fabulous coffee shop called muddy waters caffeine canteen.  tom waits is on.  i just had a delicious sandwich and am working my way through a pint glass full of coffee.  on my key ring is a set of keys to my new, lovely, sunlit apartment.  it features, among other things, a murphy bed (for real, i'm not even kidding), and fabulous built-in glass-front cabinetry.  and cool tenants.

tonight i get to hang out with lovely people before starting on the long journey back in the morning.  lunch will be at a diner in madison, wi.

"event","so i should be asleep.  and i will be soon.
a week from today, i sit for an exam that i feel terrifyingly unprepared for.  this is my own fault.  and if i fail, the thing i will regret is having spent the summer feeling uneasy without either getting my shit together and studying OR getting my shit together and deciding not to do this right now.  i chalk it up to three years of hellish brainwashing finally wearing me down to a point where i'm really afraid of not at least mimicking the herd (i couldn't actually afford to follow the herd into bar review classes, nor could i stomach the idea of another loan just to do so).  in any event, once that two-day ordeal is over, i will be hanging out in my new town of residence, exploring and running errands until i meet with my new property manager for a walk-through and a lease signing.  i'll be back in MI for just above a week, then the rents are driving out here and we will hook up a trailer to my dad's car and drive off into the sunset.

there are many things about this process that are new and different for me.  i'm excited and terrified at the same time.  i put down a deposit on an apartment i've only seen a few pictures of, trusting my instincts and the advice of friends who used to live nearby.  i can't actually afford to live there a few months from now unless i get income.  i realize that this is not insurmountable.  i also have no problem with the idea of being a barista or a bartender or somesuch until i figure out what i want to be when i grow up.  i'd rather sit on the floor (or on my new super-awesome cushy leather chairs courtesy of my property manager) eating ramen than work 80 hours a week knowing there's nothing at work but dread.  which brings me to the other thing.  i've gotten rid of a lot of furniture already, and now it looks like we'll be hitching a trailer to my dad's truck because it's way cheaper than renting a truck and trying to get my car and the truck to MN.  so i'm ditching more.  and it's not like i'm getting rid of really nice things or that i have any real emotional attachment to them.  it's just that it's stuff i've had for years, and while it will be fun to replace them when i can afford it, it feels weird to be starting over with that kind of thing right now.  i can't actually go out and furnish at will, so it will be like round 3 of student-style living, and maybe even more so since my parents had a lot to do with some of the things that i've been carting around since 2002.  so i'll be living among freecycle cast-offs and cinder-block bookshelves at age 28 while in possession of a JD from one of the best law schools in the country.  i'm not ashamed or anything like that, just bewildered.

the positive side of the lack of employment is that when i get there, i will have nothing to do for the first time in years.  sure, i'll be hitting the streets and the internet, and i plan to at least volunteer in the legal field (legal aid and/or the ACLU and/or whatever else catches my fancy) if i can't get a good law job early on.  but.  i won't have mountains of homework and tons of activities and such.  i'll get good and bored.  i'll use the public library.  i'll finally sort through the boxes of god knows what i've been pushing around.  i'll learn how to play my guitar.  i'll snuggle with my cats.  i'll date.  i'll watch dvds.  i'll cook and run and live the most mundane and lazy life i can until i have to be somewhere again.  i know it will be lonely and a culture shock, but i also think i desperately need it."

what i love is that the lecturer then goes on to say that the policy behind this is laid out on [a handout i don't have] and he summarizes it as ""well you're just taking a risk they're going to sell your stuff, that's why the rule exists.""  um.  that doesn't strike me as a policy reason so much as a description of a fucked-up rule.

"event","it seems like most people i know are very stressed out these days, for one reason or a hundred.  myself included.

i was supposed to move out thursday, and clean up the house friday.  today i bit the bullet and called my property manager to see if he thought the landlady would be cool with my leaving my stuff here for a couple of weeks after our lease was up.  the next tenants won't be here til july, and it shouldn't take him more than a few days to do what he needs to do.  basically it came down to this: i'm leaving for a week-long trip out of the country this saturday morning.  i own most of the things in our house.  and i'm still still trying to write this paper.  it's not that i've managed my time particularly well - i'm fully aware of how much this is all my own fault.  but it's so hard to stay motivated after 3 straight years of being perpetually freaked out and run down.  today while i was buried in piles of clothes in my room, desperately trying to pack for a) the summer b) vacation and c) everything else, i had a mini freak-out in which i vividly remembered the hell i put myself through leaving buffalo.  just thinking about it made me feel sick to my stomach.  luckily, i have the best property manager in the world.  he was like ""please don't worry about anything, it will be fine.""  but i still can't shake the freaked-out feeling.  i could tell you a million psychological reasons why i'm roadblocking myself out of finishing this paper, but it still has to get done.  i need to somehow force myself to do it, and then i can spend a week letting my parents pay for me to gallivant around greece.  i think mostly i'm just so deeply terrified about the prospect of being completely done.  once the paper is finished, there is no redeeming anything about my academic career.  and i have to face up to being unemployed aside from some part-time work i scrounged up for the next couple of months.

"event","ok so it's 1:44am on sunday morning.  about 25 minutes ago i got home from a house party across town being held by some of my classmates to celebrate today's ceremony.  and my brain is all over the place.

when i first started planning for law school, i saw it as a period of time that i would ""take off"" from my life.  i expected to hate it.  i just decided that it was worth a little suffering to earn such a valuable tool.  what i didn't count on was that i would not only build a life here in this silly little artificial town, but that my life in general would charge full speed ahead just like it always has.

since moving away from buffalo i have represented a client in court, visited a client in prison, edited a supreme court filing, worked in the financial district of new york city, and run an academic symposium.  i ran a marathon, lived in new york, moved to a new state for the first time, learned a lot about dating and relationships, cut my hair short, and made many many awesome friends.  when i came here, i was at the end of the first stage of the long process of finding myself and figuring out who i am under all the angst and anxiety of high school and college.  while i have frequently questioned my decision on some level, i can honestly say that leaving and challenging myself is why i was able to do everything i have done.  i am a different person.  not necessarily better.  just different.

this is terrifying.  just a couple of months of bar study and we will all scatter to the winds.  this built-in network will disappear.  and while i've been playing college student for 3 years, it seems like most people i know have gotten married or are on their way to it.  they're having kids, buying houses.  it's not that those are things that i particularly want.  it just feels like part of my life *has* been put on hold.

"event","i'd heard some rumblings about how law firms are paying incoming associates to just sort of... be elsewhere for next year, at a 2/3 pay cut.  ""elsewhere"" includes public interest work.  now already i was kind of irritated at this, both because i know enough associates-to-be to anticipate that a lot of them would be bitching and moaning about doing this work at a salary that is still far higher than what people who actually do the work for real get, and also because well...i'd love to be paid that much to do what i was going to do anyway.

but i altered some search functions on pslawnet (public service bulletin board job thingy) today, and something else hit me:  those people are removing my chance at a job.  for the sake of a temporary thing.  so their firm can continue cranking through.  because many organizations are now simply posting the opportunity for people to work for them on a law firm's dime.  i can't blame anyone involved: this is simply a time-honored biglaw tradition writ large.  firms have always farmed out their young associates for pro bono hours, counting on the fact that most public offices will be so happy to have more bodies than they need to pay for that they won't mind bearing the brunt of the on-the-job training that takes place before many of these folks can actually be of use.  organizations that are hurting especially right now are taking this as a windfall.  i get that.  but this is just so fucking frustrating.  it takes advantage of the hiring timeline discrepancy between firm jobs and public interest jobs, and makes it that much harder for me to do what i just spent three years in hell getting ready to do.

The 1991 election saw many surprising outcomes-the Social Democratic Party lost for the only the second time in over half a century, and the proportion of women in the Riksdag fell for the first time in 63 years. In addition, a real gender gap emerged, with women overwhelmingly supporting the SAP and the Liberals, and men (particularly young men) supporting parties to the right (Daune-Richard & Mahon 2001). These results led many women to question the direction of Swedish politics. The decrease in the proportion of women in the Riksdag, from 38% to 33%, or 132 to 115 representatives (Jenson & Mahon 1993), led many women to be concerned that the results signaled a move away from welfare politics (Burness 1999). These concerned women formed a group which became known as the 'Support Stockings.' They hoped to protect the gains that women had made, which they saw threatened by recent cuts in welfare state programs and in public sector employment (Bergman 1999).

The aim of the Support Stockings was to reverse the electoral losses of 1991 by 1994. The name of the group was a tribute to past women's organizations, the Blue Stockings in the 19th century, and the Red Stockings in the 1970s; it also had a ""down-to-earth, middle-aged, non-glamorous appeal"" (Burness 1999). In order to guarantee cooperation from the parties and the entire political party system, the Support Stockings threatened to form a women's political party, which was not their aim but was viewed as a last resort if cooperation was not secured. They were successful in securing cooperation and in making women's political representation an important issue in 1994-a difficult feat in a political atmosphere dominated by talk of unemployment and restructuring. The 1994 election saw the return of the SAP, and the proportion of women in parliament increased to 40.4%, or 141 representatives, with equal numbers of men and women in the cabinet (ibid.). Like many women's organizations in Sweden, the Support Stockings were focused on the state as a site of organizing; and once their goals were met, the network disappeared, and many of the women involved were absorbed into the government (Daune-Richard & Mahon 2001). As discussed above, this is typical of the Swedish version of state feminism which emerged in the 1960s.

"event","was just looking at some bar reciprocity information.  one of my many issues at the moment is i don't know where to take the bar because i don't know where i'll be, so i'm a little afraid to commit the time and money this summer.  on the other hand, this summer may be the only time when i can just take two months to do nothing but study.  i was thinking of just saying eff it and taking the minnesota bar, but considering that i've hardly even spent time there, it was feeling dangerous.

it looks like taking minnesota might actually be a good bet, because their reciprocity requirements are stricter than some of the other states i was thinking about (new york, illinois), and those other states accept the minnesota exam.  i had been under the impression this was more complicated and restricted than it is.

anyway.
back to panicking."

1. What did you do in 2008 that you'd never done before?
Ran a marathon
Danced on a table
Lived in NYC
Hung out in Central Park
Went out dancing wearing only fishnet
Got paid to do legal work

2. Did you keep your new year's resolutions, and will you make more for next year?
Kind of.  I got in much much better shape thanks to the obsessive running, but I didn't really lose weight I wanted to lose, and I need to be eating better.  I think my resolution for the coming year should be about treating myself with more kindness.

3. Did anyone close to you give birth?
Yep, I have a new niece.

4. Did anyone close to you die?
Not exactly, more like someone close to someone I'm close to.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?
Aside from sore knees and a lost toenail, nope.

11. What was the best thing you bought?

The intense humanity of everyone I know, including myself, was abundantly apparent this year.

See #12.

""Accelerate"" - REM.  Makes me think of running along the Hudson in the sunshine.

i. happier or sadder? About the same I guess. It's been a rollercoaster but right now I'm alright.
ii. thinner or fatter? Marginally heavier but leaner cause of the muskles.
iii. richer or poorer? Poorer.

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?
Doing what I was supposed to do instead of just worrying about it.

Worrying.

22. Did you fall in love in 2008?

24. What was your favorite TV program?
Pushing Daisies, Ugly Betty, Torchwood

25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?
Hate is not something I like to engage in.  But I did find some things out that sucked.

32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?
If my summer job brought more certainty into my life rather than creating mounds of uncertainty and panic.
Or getting a clerkship.

I spend too much time at Loehmann's.
Also this summer: shit.  it's hot and I work in the financial district.  Dress plz.

34. What kept you sane?
That might be the problem.

35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?
Obama is so dreamy.

36. What political issue stirred you the most?
A lot of stuff from work which I probably shouldn't talk about.  The presidential race.

Some people from work.  Some people at the LSRJ conference.  Theresa from Team in Training.  And my 1L minions.

39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2008:

Don't spend your whole life waiting for your whole life."

"event","Imagine you're driving down a very wide highway that's 50 lanes across even though there are no lines dividing one lane from another. Speed limit signs aren't posted, and some vehicles are zipping along in zigzag paths at over 100 mph while others crawl along like old-lady turtles. Now and then you've got to weave your way through a congested area where many on-ramps all feed into the road simultaneously. You haven't seen an off-ramp yet, and you're not sure where to get off anyway. I figure, Aquarius, that 2008 had some resemblance to the scenario I just described. Luckily, I predict that no later than your birthday, you will find an off-ramp and exit onto an uncluttered backroad with great scenery.

"event","Have had a lot going on in my life recently (who hasnt!?), which also included recently experience rather severe loss of appetite and insomnia.  Doctor says its anxiety, but im avoiding anti-anxiety medication as I feel its too addictive a substance for my interest.  The insomnia has kept me up to between 5am-8am everyday for the last two weeks, which isnt so bad since i do still get a good 3-4 hours sleep.  Our roof on our home has been experience multiple leaks during this intense winter, and so we made the $10K investment to have our roof redone.  Sadly, i forgot that would all begin today Monday the 10th.  So while i was laying in bed at 7am I was greeted with the distinct voice of a bunch of bearish construction workers arriving.  About fourty minutes into their work I realized i wont be sleep in sadly till tonight, as my room is the first to have its roof removed.  Its like an earthquake, i feel every hammer/jab/scrape they are performing.

Still in a healthy relationship, we hit two years on valentines day - very much so my longest relationship.  Work ended abruptly when i was denied my right to file a claim of harrassment associated to my coworker to my supervisor.  Because of this all i have to support my claims is a osha violation i filed over the phone.  Looking for new employment but between my fathers care and my own issues ive found myself mostly paralyzed by fear.  I hermit myself into my room and rarely leave now, its disgusting that its come to this.

Hope life is being generous to you all~"

"event","So, who else expects younger generations to hate republicans now that a huge amount of blame is getting pointed at them as having cost the economy 24 billion over this 16 day shut down.  It felt a lot like angry kids taking their ball and going home until all their friends told them theyd never talk to them again.

Anyway, what was nuts to me was the stenographer who stood up and accused congress of being a bunch of satan worshipping free masons.  I certainly havent fed myself the conspiracy that free masons are satan worshippers... but i do have a free mason hall near me where they openly say hateful things to minorities and visually homosexual couples.  Had been told to ""go back to gods land faggots"" by an old couple when i walked past holding my boyfriends hand.  And now that we got a few indian families ,,,,walking through Hatboro with their kids ive listened to the free masons complain about ""the smelly indian slaves"" at the train station next to the mason hall.  But i always just attributed it to the idea that old caucasian people are just horrible human beings, and free masons arent any different.

A shame though, i really do feel like this whole shut down is going to throw the uneducated into the arms of the democrats.  And you know in the future youll hear people argue politics while saying ""yeah but the republicans caused over a million people to work for free for 16 days and had 800,000 employees lose work for 16 days costing the economy 24 billion."" 

Maybe people will discuss cheerful things like... jesus what is even cheerful anymore? XD"

It was a good time, saw many friends i have seen in like... 20 months?  Feels good to say hello.  I also got to show off my partial fursuit.  I have to admit it was a lot of fun to do so, got about 1.5 hours of suiting in before drying off and spending an hour barking at people before making the drive home.  I hope to spend more time with fuzzballs in the future.  Seeing all my ""real life"" friends become jaded, two-faced, and bitter - has left me feeling like I left the friends who didnt take advantage of me.... Furries.

Hope you all are well, bark at you soon

"event","Not a human, but this companion meant -a lot- to me.  Yesterday I had to take my sugar glider to the vet, he had gangrene in his hindlegs where he got trapped in his pouch and circulation was cut off.  He didn't bark for help, he hid because if  he made noise a predator would come kill him... that's instict.

It was  offered to amputate limbs and try to recoop but the cost of the surgery and the upkeep  was well out oof my price range... so I was forced to put my companion of five years to sleep.  I sobbed all day, I'm holding back tears even now.  He was buried in a leather box I had from jewelery, and I put my picture and a note in it for him... he mattered so much to me that all I can do is regret not caring for him like he deserved.  If I could have afforded the surgery today my friend would be alive, I feel nothing but inadaquette now.  

I'm sure time will heal my wound, but he was mine - I lived out of my home when I got him, I cared for him, no one ever helped me.  I loved Ryuu.  I always will.

Goodbye my dear friend."

Apparently,  I impressed everyone with my initiative and willingness to go above and beyond and got a doctor and my site supervisor to feel the need to write  them for me.  That gives me three letters of recommendation for being a medical assistant.  Hopefully, that will help outweight the fact that I'm a high school drop out with a GED.

I have finished school for Medical Assisting, this week I began my externship with a weight loss and surgery center.  Been a fun and exciting opportunity to work with folks in a not very demanding position... I do busy work.  It's going to be a fun ride for the next 120/hours of work unpaid.

I now have no roommates living in my home with my father and I, going from four people to two.  Tomorrow a dumpster arrives that I have to fill with tons and tons of garbage, it'll mean great things for the house though.  Looking forward to the mass exodus.

My dad broke his foot, and had an infection, but I have been helping him through the healing process.  He also got a new cat, can you believe I don't even know it's name?  I live in the same house as it, and I just call it ""The Loud One"".  My sugar glider is my priority over that little meow-bucket... even if it is cute.

Furry related things... maybe MFF this year?  and uh... I'm seeing someone?

I know right?  Been long enough.  Maybe I'll tell you more later?  ... Okay I will, someone who shall remained unnamed makes demands and I submit -_-

I sleep with them on my window ledge beside me and even moving my entire bedding setup didn't help me find them after three repeated teardowns of my bedding area.  I can't even fathom what I did, I'm really praying lastnight I didn't do something with them in a sleep deprived zombie-coma because without them I can't really do any of my school work, drive, or get to work tonight...

When you are young people tell you that your lucky to have so much free time and that you don't properly appreciate it?  Curse them for being so right.

Life goes on, my roommate is making changes in his life at a rapid pace - I find myself feeling like I need to do the same... wonder if its a sense of conformity or if its something I truely need.  My father is in good health for most purposes, his memory is really going and it adds a challange to each day - but I love him so I shall tough it out beside him.

My mother... well let's not talk about that.  Watched some movies, played some games, heard some music, and ate some food.  Hope you all are doing well, I promise I read LJ everyday even if I am so miserable about posting myself!

After my less than 100ft dash I found myself so weak and incapable of breathing I was overwhelmed with a sense of terror.

Alright on a serious note I want to give special thanks to everyone on staff at MFF this weekend for giving me the opportunity to come back and help.  I was alarmed to find I am apparently the youngest member on staff o.o

All you great people who gave up your time to make this weekend happen for folks: Thank you.

In the end I think the convention went really well for its con goers, and I think staff managed to survive in the end.  Sadly I had to leave before the stafff and volunteer dinner tonight but I don't mind because in the end I feel really good.

A pretty young girl had issues with her parking saturday, I continued to look into it for her and in the end couldn't even get her a refund but she shook my hand and told me with such passion ""thank you so much, your the only person who even seemed to care about my problem.  Thank you so much for caring.""  I was touched, and suddenly felt guilty for complaining that I was working as much as I was...  even if she was the only person who was helped by me this weekend its enough for me.

It wasn't a vacation, but I don't regret it at all."

I never thought id miss being at home working as much as I do right now, the saving grace to my vacation has been having a great roomie.  Otherwise its been a waste of money and time, everything I wanted to do won't be done do to working the convention im visiting.

Sunday night ill get home around 10pm and be able to enjoy the few hours of solitude it'll provide me to reflect on my weekend to identify the good points.  So far its been:
-nice roomie.
-nice coworkers.
-seeing friends who I can't spend time with.

Not making nay new friends because I've almost completely lacked socialization time.  If I get let out of work all I can do is wander around aimlessly hoping to find one of the people I know to talk for a matter of moments before they go off to do something else.

"event","Well time for your regularly scheduled update!  I learned this week that weathermen are very mean - they lie and say we will get another big storm and instead I get disapointment.

In other news, my grandfather broke his hip.  This happened two weeks ago, but no one found out till this week because my mom kept him restrained and away from a phone so he couldn't call for help.  She knew that if he went in the hospital for recovery shed be homeless.  So instead of making sure her FATHER was properly cared for she hid him until her brother found out.  Now grandpa is in the hospital, and mom is looking at being homeless.

I only found out because of a drunken assault my mom tried to committ at a bar ending in police contacting me.  So I investigated in my family and found out the full deal.  Holy fuck that's shitty.

Father went to hospital finally, now its been daily doctor and cardiologist visits as he recovers.  Been cooking for him and taking care of all his errands.  He appreciates it, and I use it as a test of my patience.

Kung-fu has been going well, steady increase in adult students - though I did lose a pair of kids (brothers).  Been doing Bot Chom Doh vs Luk Dim Poon Kwan training - good times.

Enjoyable Moment: while gaming at a local hobbystore a kid came in and his mother shortly followed, it was apparent the kid had his mom on a leash.  He picks his items out and she pays, as they go to leave the kid shoves another young guy out of the way from the door to leave and suddenly his mom BITCH SLAPPED him and said ""you can mistreat me, but don't think a stranger will take your shit.  Now get in the fucking car!""

I.  Was.  Floored.

My father went in for heart surgery again, they were fixing the debocle that was the last surgery.  Things went smoothly, he was out of recovery in 24 hours.  I've been with him the whole way, so I have been caring for him the entire trip... until we got home.  

He asked for me to let him walk, so I turned around and WHAM! He dropped like a ton of bricks and busted his fake hip on the cement.  Its been three full days of agonizing torture since than as he's moaned cried and whaled over the agony, but refuses to see a doctor or go to the hospital.

Many interviws have come and gone, no job yet - resume is actively being considered at least.  

Kung fu goes well, only poo poo part was eating at a place that was like aladdins palace and everyone ate with their hands... out of the same dish... yuck.

No snow recently!  YAY!   Too much snow this winter for me, so ill cherrish the lack of it recently.  Also Warhammer 40K has been in big boom lately :) so hooray for that!

"event","When I was a child, id act a certain way - but when someone claimed I acted another way id do so to spite them.  This was called being immature.

As an adult (mostly adult... kinda) I see people do the same thing all the time.  Especially, when online in internet communication or things like xbox chat.  People will release all concepts of mature communication to replace it with the most child like options availble including: yelling into your microphone nonsensically so that someone else can't speak, or simply continue to blabber over someone else to avoid letting them ""give their perspective"".

If you tried that in real life, someone would have broken your smile into a crackhead suck hole.  So what makes people feel they should make such communication their focus?  

Lack of morals?  Or maybe just lack of interest in holding what might have been an educational conversation with oneof the parties involved.  But id assume more so a lack of moral will & moral skill.

The moral skill to determine the difference between right & wrong, and the moral will to take actions to adhere to what's right instead of breeding what's wrong.

Sometimes its better to walk away, but I can't help but feel I missed an opportunity to better understand someones point of view... but I can't force them to be an adult.

Cest le ve.

DaveQat: thank you so much for everything, from driving me from the airport to the hotel early morning friday to provided me a shoulder to rest on when needed.

Cicero/Reddywhip: for doing that voodoo that you do so well >:)~

Cryptowolf: I don't even think you read my LJ, but you were awesome at Megaplex and now you were a real mench at MFF.  You worked countless hours, kept up with wonderful conversation, and always kept a posative attitude - we were blessed to have your help.  I was very lucky to meet someone so generous with their time, and of course thank you for seeing me off to the airport sunday.

Gadget/Pouncer: don't think you two read here either, but you two put up with me and my bitterness - while simultaniously conquering every task placed before you.  You two beside crypto and carl acted as the cornerstones that made volunteering a success this year.  You guys also love the same anime as me so <3

Roby Panther!: because he's a total sweetheart, like really - he's one of a dieing breed so you single folks better hunt him down.  Brought me his left over chinese for dinner saturday, it was the only food outside of con provided snacks and the one breakfest I had by myself.  Not to mention he was going to work for me if I needed, and he attended a panel with me *wag*  it was nice.

Sevenwolf: for providing me space to room in, and all your hard work at the con.

Duncan D Husky & Takaza: though you guys already heard it lots, I must say it again - you two are wonderful for all your hard work.  Im a sap, I totally cried with you when you were given your plague ;)

Furp: I met many people who were honoring your memory, as well as seeing your mother about the con.  I came this year to support the con, but when I was down and questioning my decisions id just think about what you'd told me last year.  I still think about you, and im sure others do as well.  I hope somewhere im lucky enough that your seeing how everyone feels.

Spikedpunch & Silverlonewolf: for keeping me company, offering to bring me things, being generally silly, and of course letting me talk warhammer at you *wag*

Snowie & Elipsis: as if you guys need a reason for me to thank you, cause your so overflowing with awesome thanks just spill out on the streets for you both. But seriously, thank you so much for spending time with me and trying to find me for dinner sunday.  The thought really does count :)

And what I will admit to be the most important thanks:

Perro & Wolphy: guys, I know I told thanks in my last post - and I hope I did at con as well, but thank you so much.  Toby managed to lift my spirits with two sentances, one commenting on my looks (im so vain!) and the other my efforts.  It never ceases to amaze me how one man stepping up and showing you his appreciation can make you forget your woes.  Wolphy?  For being the sweetie who made sure I felt loved, and made sure I never felt like I was doing it for nothing... infact on those grounds 2 new names join this special thanks spot:

Charlesbear and Vish:  because both of you went out of your way to socialize with me and make me feel appreciated as well, from hugs to jokes - and even belly pokes.



Well, im unsure what ill do about MFF 2010 - whether ill enjoy it or not kinda doesn't matter.  Furp told me to help others like he did me, and I plan to honor that - so I think ill keep up my efforts for MFF as long as they'll have me.

Lastly but most needed: every single gopher who aided MFF, thank you for every minute you spared from your convention experience to help us make it a great one for everyone else - we can't do it without you.

"event","Howdy my friendly journal-browsers!

Im sitting in the chicago airport waiting on my flight - and it occurs to me I should update.  The con was pretty fast paced for me, work work work.  Roomed in one of Seven's rooms as intended, Logarth was the roomie I knew and he was good peoples(puppies) as always.  Though I did have an incident with a minor getting poo stains on the bed I had to sleep in... it allowed for me to make ""shitty con"" jokes though!

Saw tons of great people, got hugs and such which is always appreciated.  Also found a replica of the zanpaktou of urihara from Bleach (Cry Out, Benihime!)
I would like to add thanks, THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO SPARED THEIR TIME TO SHARE SOME WITH ME.

I laughed, I cried, I even made new friends.  Good times.  Speaking of good times, I saw josh von! (Loki) who's this wonderful guy I've been friends with for years.  Spikedpunch and silverlonewolf whom both provided me amazing company, I made a wulven model for Spiked with his initials on the shoulder.. And left it at home in PA ;_;

I don't know what else to say really, except Perro is the fucking man.  He single handedly erased the majority of my dissapointments with only two sentances.  So perro and wolphy?  Im in your debt.

To everyone else?  Thank you.  Stay healthy everyone, hope to talk to you soon.

Kung-fu Dave, signing off."

"event","Watching the sunrise on the runway at Philadelphia International Airport.  Spoke with a few folks via-aim this morning, I am now aware that out of the dozens people I knew going, a scattered few remain.  Most couldn't afford the con, many others last minute decided against going because those they wanted to see won't be there.

Seriously, at this point I feel like im going only due to my obligation as a member of staff - I can't openly say im excited to encounter the new challenges my weekend faces.

Hope some of you readers are still attending, say hi if you are!  At least ill get to see my favorite warhammer40k conversationalist: Spikedpunch :D"

"event","Well im sitting at a hotel waiting for my shuttle to the airport, had spent most of the night struggling to sleep cause I was so anxious to get to see someone this weekend.  Like magic, this person was booted out of the convention lastnight and was barred from returning.  So at 4:45 I feel like im going to vomit while I sit here.

Most of the people I go to MFF to see aren't going, they dislike the hotel staff/hotel itself and don't see a value in spending the money to deal with them.  Over the past two months I went from having a dozen people I was anxious to see.... to having 3.  Than lastnight it was slumped down to 2.

Many others it'll be nice to see, but now im left with this big hole in my gut that tells me this is a huge mistake - so I sure hope my weekend turns out better than the clues are saying.  The person im rooming with is Seven Wolf, but I haven't spoken to him in a long while so I hope my room is still secure :(  the man they kicked out of the con was a friend who was going to be nice enough to let me room with him if my room fell through.

So now I wait to fly to chicago, maybe have no room, but definitely not have the guy I was supposed to take out for beers and catch up after years of seperation.

If someone pulls the fire alarm this year, im going to choke slam someone."

"event","Good afternoon readers!

Well its been an alright week, been helping my dad day to day and working on my Daemon Hunter army for Warhammer 40k.  This weekend is a mix of plans which are slowly becoming a wash for me sadly.

Last night was bear night at the Bike Stop in philadelphia so i went with snowie and soxpup - I was fed lots of beer (by my standards) and stood shirtless in a bar.  New experience for meeeee~

We went to IHOP and stuff, I got home around 3:30 and had to wake up by 7.  Ugh. :D
Definitely wanna go back with snowie more though, she even had been social enough that the bartender knew her by name!

Today I taught class, and I did my morning work out...my hang over won and I vomitted tons.  So I ditched training and went home for a nap.  Was going to go to the FA: United meeting today in Mt. Laurel, so I packed the car and hit the road.  I was a mile away from the interstate when my dad called, he fell down the stairs and needed me to be home to care for him...

So now im home, he's in bed medicated and asleep, and im wondering if next week will work out or if ill get called at MFF about my Dad.

Well, I guess ill go play Dragon Age and come check on my dad again in 30min.  Shawn if you read this im sorry I missed the meeting, your still awesome for buying lunch for everyone!

Have a nice weekend guys & gals"

"event","Well today was the first day of the 2009 Mechanicon warhammer 40k grand tournament.  The entrance fee is $120, you play 5 battles against one of the many opponents and score points towards your end ranking.  Each army is 1850 points, I decided to join as Chaos Daemons (Nurgle/Khorne/Slaanesh).

I arrived at 10am, it started at 9... they never gave timing info out :( so I forfeit my first round and get 0 points.  

Second round I play Imperial Guard, I do well but my greater daemon died to a rules error... and she was blowing up tanks every turn after the first.  But im a good sport and kept up the 40k spirit the whole time.  

Third round I face salamanders chapter of space marines, though they were painted as possessed iron legion.  I lost as I had a mission 2 sheet, everyone else had mission 3... I played to the wrong mission objectives :(   Lots of people commented after they didn't understand what I was doing... I wish someone just spoke up instead of watching me play a different battle for 6 rounds.

Tomorrow I go back for my final two rounds, but over all im really dissapointed in this grand tournament.  The modeled armies are nice, but the rules F up really hurt - followed up by mission F up... felt like crap.  Hopefully tomorrow ill enjoy my games more, the big thing is I keep trying to seem friendly and happy regardless.  Im pushing to get a ""good sportsman"" trophey LOL

Moral victory for the win?

IN OTHER NEWS: Spikedpunch chatted with me afterwards and it helped me feel much better.

Slaanesh commands you to commit horrible acts upon yourself in a pseudo-sexual fashion... so get on top of that? :)

Have a good weekend guys, if you read this far into my battle report kudos to you!"

"event","What an interesting set of dreams I had lastnight!  Got home from the party, spent a little time on AIM and than went to sleep - than the dreams started.

First dream was about my old house, all these changes done to it - and most importantly my mom.  That dream ended suddenly and left me feeling like I had unfinished business.

Second dream was I was lost somewhere, saw Flightline on the sidewalk and I stopped and asked for his help.  He took me to his house, helped me with directions, cooked me food, and all this other wild shit - it was pretty crazy really!  Than I woke up and felt like I had unfinished business there.

What wierd dreams, maybe I need to go get lost in delaware and ask flightline for help :D

"event","Well it was a rather action packed halloween, taught my kids and did costume/games with them.  Judged a costume contest at my local hobby store, ran warhammer 40k cities of death in a full costume for four hours, and than went to lupines.

Lupines was packed!  He's such a nice host, and I got to see lots of nice folks.  Only one sour part to today and I don't really wanna give full details but...

Today I experienced something I hadn't in a while, and it was pretty hard on me.  I feel like a recovering heroin addict who just got provided a free dose.  Now im back to feeling like im battling these emmotions.  Booooooo.

Happy Halloween though :) even if it was all rainy and yucky."

"event","<p><font size=""1"">Zomg.&nbsp;Today = Funny&nbsp;shitxzxzxz.<br />Met Siobhan at Compass. Then bought food.<br />Then&nbsp;headed t Amber's!<br />Played hide-and-seek with Amber&nbsp;when&nbsp;we reached.<br />Called her and told her we were at Block 408 instead of 404B.<br />haha, She was like shouting on the phone, saying we stopped at the wrong&nbsp;stop.&nbsp;<br />Then hid at the&nbsp;playground! Then&nbsp;Siobhan got stucked in&nbsp;the slide. ahha.&nbsp;<br />Instead of helping her, I kept laughing. hehe (:&nbsp;<br />Then Amber saw us.. haha.&nbsp;<br />So walked t the Bus stop.&nbsp;<br /><br />Me: Eh, 103! Our&nbsp;bus, our bus!<br />Amber:&nbsp; We're taking 103<u>W</u> la! <br />Siobhan:&nbsp;hahaha! <br />Me: Eh, no! That's 103W!!&nbsp;*Starts running like a loser.&nbsp;<br />Amber and Siobhan:&nbsp; HAHHAHAHAHA. (While running somemore)&nbsp;<br /><br />haha, funny shit!<br /><br />Hah, the Auntie at the bus stop was laughing at us la!&nbsp;<br />So waited for the next bus. And&nbsp;it came like 30 minutes after?!&nbsp;<br />So while waiting, we actually sat&nbsp;on the <u>floor.</u>&nbsp;<br />We had like a small picnic at the bus stop. haha.&nbsp;<br />Listened t the radio.&nbsp;<br />Then Siobhan suggested sun-tanning? Yes, at the bus stop. <br />Was talking halfway,&nbsp;then the bus came.&nbsp;<br />Then there i was being very&nbsp;kiasu,&nbsp;running&nbsp;for the bus again.<br />Then Siobhan just left&nbsp;her phone on the floor?&nbsp;haiyoh.&nbsp;<br />Then halfway there, i asked the bus driver t tell&nbsp;us when<br />it's our stop, cos' we don't really know where it was.<br />He was like "" uh, uh.""&nbsp;<br /><br />Then i&nbsp;saw Seletar country club! But we didn't press the bell!<br />Then i was like running t the bus uncle.&nbsp;<br />"" Uncle! Stop, stop! Uncle!&nbsp;<br />And the bus driver couldn't even hear me, so he continued driving!&nbsp;<br />Then Amber got pissed, haha. So she talked t the bus driver.&nbsp;<br />She came back telling me that he doesn't even understand English!&nbsp;<br />So the bus driver went one whole big round, then we missed our stop, like again!<br />So we stopped like 3 stops after that.<br />Had t walk, like up a hill.&nbsp;<br />So we decided t hitch-hike!<br />Then this&nbsp;uncle driving his van stopped for us.&nbsp;<br />Then he drove us in Seletar Country club.&nbsp;<br />And Amber was like, ""You nice man.""<br />Siobhan and me were like laughing.<br /><br />Got there, played catching in Pirates place!<br />Then headed t the mini ""cafe"" and the food was like f expensive.<br />So Amber bought Nasi lemak, and it cost 5 bucks.&nbsp;<br />Siobhan and me just bought cincau. <br />After that, went t the toilet,<br />Then Siobhan and Amber were sitting on the Massage chair.&nbsp;<br />And i was watching them :/&nbsp;<br />After that, headed t the gym t work out.<br />Amber couldn't do anything. Cos' she doesn't have any shoes on.&nbsp;<br />Then some guy trainee scolded her.&nbsp;<br />In the end, the trainee was like making friends with us.<br />Then he started ""training"" us.&nbsp;<br />Cos' Siobhan and I were wondering how t get abs.&nbsp;<br />The exercise was f tough la!<br />Worked out for a few hours, went back t pirates place t get our bags!<br /><br />Then Siobhan realised she lost her wallet. So we went around t look for it.&nbsp;<br />Then couln't find it. She had like 8 bucks in her wallet?&nbsp;<br />After that, hitch-hiked again. But a taxi drove us outside Seletar for freeeeee.&nbsp;<br />So had t take a bus t Jalan Kayu, ate Roti prata!&nbsp;<br />After our workout somemore,<br />So all that exercise for nothing.&nbsp;<br />Then Amber, being the most annoying shit ever.&nbsp;<br />Kept asking me whether we're buying this glutinous rice ball bean curd thing.&nbsp;<br />Cos' i was the only one there that had money. haha.&nbsp;<br />So after that, cabbed t the bus stop at Amber's house.&nbsp;<br />Then Siobhan went home.&nbsp;<br />Sat under some Block and talked. Ate the bean curd thing! Niceeeeee.&nbsp;<br />After that, Amber walked me t the bus stop. Then headed home.<br />Tomorrow's Natalie's birthday! <br /></font></p>"

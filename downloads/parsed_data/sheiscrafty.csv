After all the veggies were soft I added 3 cups of leftover mashed potatoes and turned the heat down to low medium until they were mixed in and thickened the soup.&nbsp; I added a few tablespoons of olive oil to make it more savory.&nbsp; I turned the heat off completely and mixed in 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese.

"event","just heard a fantastic new song. maybe its not new, but i've never heard it before.

""angels on the moon"" by thriving ivory

<i>Do you dream, that the world will know your name?
So tell me your name
And do you care, about all the little things or anything at all?
I wanna feel, all the chemicals inside I wanna feel
I wanna sunburn, just to know that I'm alive
To know I'm alive

Don't tell me if I'm dying, 'cause I don't wanna know
If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go
Don't wake me 'cause I'm dreaming, of angels on the moon
Where everyone you know, never leaves too soon

Do you believe, in the day that you were born?
Tell me, do you believe?
And do you know, that everyday's the first of the rest of your life?

Don't tell me if I'm dying, 'cause I don't wanna know
If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go
Don't wake me 'cause I'm dreaming, of angels on the moon
Where everyone you know, never leaves too soon

This is to one last day in the shadows
And to know a brother's love
This is to New York City angels
And the rivers of our blood
This is to all of us, to all of us

So don't tell me if I'm dying, 'cause I don't wanna know
If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go
Don't wake me cause I'm dreaming, of angels on the moon
Where everyone you know, never leaves too soon

Yeah, you can tell me all your thoughts
About the stars that fill polluted skies
And show me where you run to
When no one's left to take your side
But don't tell me where the road ends
'Cause I just don't wanna know, 
No I don't wanna know

Don't tell me if I'm dying
Don't tell me if I'm dying
Don't tell me if I'm dying</i>"

Saw it yesterday, looked round it twice yesterday, went back today to have another look, put in an offer that was under what they were asking (didn't expect to get it, was thinking we'd have to walk away and continue the search) and the agent rang an hour later and said we got it.

Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee so excited! We are going to be homeowners!

"event","So I've decided that I'm going to start giving my crochet stuff away for charity. I'll still put some things up for sale, but I want to do something to help other people. I don't have the time right now to make a commitment to volunteering, as much as I would love to. I'd really like to work for the soup van, or mission Australia's youth beat program, but at this stage I can't give a definite time each week that I'm available for because I've got too much going on with uni and work.

So, because I make so much random crochet stuff I thought I'd give some away. (seriously, I spend every night working on something, I have about 15 unfinished projects in a set of drawers in the lounge room, only a handful of things I make end up on etsy).

I'd like to give blankets, toys and baby booties and things like that to the women's shelter, as they often have women with children in crisis situations. They are an unpublished address (naturally) so I'd have to ring them to organise giving them a donation. There's also bethlehem house which is a crisis shelter for homeless men. I'd also like to give scarves and gloves to homeless youth but at this stage I'm not sure which organisation would be the best one to choose to make sure they get to the people who need them.

If anyone has any wool lying around that you aren't going to use, it doesn't matter how much or what colours, or a few dollars spare that you feel like donating to the cause, please let me know. If anyone does donate money I'll use it to stock up my wool supply, I won't keep it for myself or anything like that.

Thanks :)

"event","oh my goodness uni is giving my brain some grief.

exams are next week. i was hoping to spend some time during prac studying but was so exhausted every day that I didn't get the chance to, so now I have this week alone to study for them. I have 3 exams - 2 bio ones and a foundations one. foundations I'm barely concerned about, but bio is insane. we have to know so much information. I spent yesterday and so far today going through past exam papers and while some of the questions I can answer, there are so many more that I cant.

I'm having trouble concentrating enough to study too, I dont know why. I guess cause I haven't been to a lecture for over 3 weeks my brain has goten out of that academic frame. gah.

I'll cope though. I'm procrastinating at the moment, but thats okay. I watched a dvd earlier with a live dissection of the digestive system, that was pretty interesting. digestive is one of the exam topics so it was relevant, too. I still have about 20 pages of questions on the exam papers to research and find the answers to. i'm reading through my lecture notes carefully and when I find an answer, noting it down. that way i've still had to think about it and find it so its not like i just flicked through and found the answer.

I'm considering becoming a midwife. I still have to finish nursing, and midwifery is a post grad degree so I can do it part time over 2 years while working. I just think I'd get bored way too quickly just being a general ward nurse, and I want to do something that really matters. Plus, I dont want to sound up myself, but the fact that I'm doing so well at uni so far makes me think maybe I should make the most of my brains and study further. I dunno.

I know I want to specialise in something. Wound management would be awesome, I love wounds and all the thousands of dressing types and the way the body repairs itself and stuff. mental health i'm not so keen on now. I still would like to help people with those sorts of problems but i get too fired up about it I think. I get too pissed off when people make derogatory comments about mental illness. That could be a good or a bad thing if I was working in that field.

we'll see, I guess. have to get through this lot of exams and another semester before I can seriously consider a specialty.

What Love means to a 4-8 year old . . . Slow down for three minutes to read this. It is so worth it. Touching words from the mouth of babes. A group of professional people posed this question to a group of 4 to 8 year-olds, ""What does love mean?"" 
The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone could have imagined. See what you think: 





""When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails anymore. 
So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too. That's love."" 

Rebecca- age 8 






""When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. 
You just know that your name is safe in their mouth."" 

Billy - age 4 




""Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other."" 

Karl - age 5 


""Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French fries without making them give you any of theirs."" 

Chrissy - age 6 



""Love is what makes you smile when you're tired."" 

Terri - age 4 



""Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK."" 

Danny - age 7 



""Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get tired of kissing, you still want to be together and you talk more. 
My Mommy and Daddy are like that. They look gross when they kiss"" 

Emily - age 8 



""Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen."" 

Bobby - age 7 (Wow!) 



""If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who you hate,"" 

Nikka - age 6 
(we need a few million more Nikka's on this planet) 



""Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday."" 

Noelle - age 7 



""Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well."" 

Tommy - age 6 



""During my piano recital, I was on a stage and I was scared. I looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. 

He was the only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore."" 

Cindy - age 8 



""My mommy loves me more than anybody 
You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night."" 

Clare - age 6 



""Love is when Mommy gives Daddy the best piece of chicken."" 

Elaine-age 5 



""Love is when Mommy sees Daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford."" 

Chris - age 7 



""Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day."" 

Mary Ann - age 4 



""I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones."" 

Lauren - age 4 



""When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you."" (what an image) 

Karen - age 7 



""Love is when Mommy sees Daddy on the toilet and she doesn't think it's gross."" 

Mark - age 6 



""You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget."" 

Jessica - age 8 



And the final one -- Author and lecturer Leo Buscaglia once talked about a contest he was asked to judge. 

The purpose of the contest was to find the most caring child. 

The winner was a four year old child whose next door neighbor was an elderly gentleman who had recently lost his wife. 

Upon seeing the man cry, the little boy went into the old gentleman's yard, climbed onto his lap, and just sat there. 

When his Mother asked what he had said to the neighbor, the little boy said, 

""Nothing, I just helped him cry"""

"event","I went out with Em last night, it was awesome fun. She came around about 9ish, with a bottle of Ricadonna. We polished that off while getting ready and then hit the vino. That didn't work so well, lol... apparently it was a bit vinegary :S Not too sure how that happened but thats okay. After we'd downed that, gotten ourselves all pretty and perfect, we rang for a cab then sat outside looking at the stars (and my weird new neighbours across the road) while we waited.

We headed in to the James. I love that place. I dont know if its just the $5 cocktails, the fact that the cocktails are awesome, or the place, but I love it. Em's friend (and probably future husband, but both of them are in denial) was working the door. That provided for a fair amount of entertainment. He's bought a new bike, a ninja, and it was parked across the road. he was bragging about the speeds it can get up to and so on, so we were taking the piss out of him.

We had a couple of coronas and then hit the cocktails. Before we headed out, Em told me that she was planning to get pissed, but not pissed pissed pissed. After her second or third teapot, she swayed towards me and whispered loudly 'you know i said i wasn't gonna get pissed pissed pissed? well right now... i'm about pissed pissed'. We found it very entertaining how if one of us moved fast the other one could see them in 2 places until our brains caught up. yeah, okay, we were drunk. I had a few teapots too, and man they are good, but then I was on the tuscan nights which I adore.

Everything was amazing me last night. I was really happy when I started drinking, so my mood was fantastic all night long. Everything was really pretty. I went to the toilet at one point and my feet in my sparkly black shoes and my pants around my knees and the graffiti on the door looked so amazing. hahaha. I seriously wanted to take a photo, and would have done if I'd had my camera. Admittedly the toilets are lit up in a purple/pink colour so it did look pretty cool, but I dont know if it was really photo material.

All of a sudden it was nearly 1am, so we decided to have just one more cocktail then head to the saloon for a dance and to find some uni people who were meant to be out. Two, maybe three, cocktails later we made it outside and walked round to the saloon. Neither of us could feel our legs, or faces, or hands, so walking was extremely funny.

By this stage the saloon was pretty busy, but it was late so it was free, and they didn't even check ID's or anything. (Not that it matters, I'm way overage!). It was fantastic. Again, everything was beautiful. We dashed in for a toilet run and I met a girl who was in love with my dress, and so we had a big talk about that and the shop I got it from. Then out to the dance floor. The band were still playing and every song was a great one. We were up near the front and it was like there was no one there, or something. I mean it was busy but no one was bumping us or crushing us or being annoying, everyone there had a really great vibe.

Found Mark and his new woman, mingwah (I cant remember her name, but she was a pain. she didn't like him talking to us much). And one of the first years emily was looking after on Monday was like 'OH MY GOD!! ITS MY MENTOR!!' every time she saw us. I asked her friend if she did nursing, and the reply was, 'i love dancing!!!' That amused me for a while. The band finished and they played some decent club music. We danced for ages. We decided to go say goodbye to Luke before he knocked off. Wandered back to the james, via some drunk old men who said that we should have a father daughter sex relationship with them cause emily told them to fuck off they were too old (lol). Said goodbye to Luke, and then he sped down the street on his bike. They didn't even hug goodbye. honestly, they both like each other but neither will do anything, because it might affect the friendship.

After that we went down to the pizza place for a slice of pizza. Its not as good as la bella. But while we were queuing to get served, this guy came walking down the road from saloon, stopped, got down on his knees, did a somersault type thing, and then stood up. Ems and I pissed ourselves, and em took the piss about him doing a grandma concrete roll. He came up to talk to us and was very funny, him and em got along really well. Anyway he wandered off, and we got served. next thing he was back ""thats the two girls who were picking on me!!"" and then Mark said ""its Rach n Em!!!!' haha. so he turned out to be one of marks friends, and he lives at AMC which is just across the road from my place, on the other side of uni.

He told us he was sick of being the third wheel to mark and his woman so we said he could come talk to us. I have no idea what his name was, but he's doing engineering and is from qld, thats all I can remember. Em and him hit it off pretty darn well though. We offered for him to come in our cab on the way home, because mark and his woman were being all affectionate and we were all going to the same place.

They had a very interesting conversation on the way home about the engineering of midwifery and c-sections, and trajectory and angles of babys and afterbirth on the walls and so on. I couldn't stop laughing and the taxi driver just looked terrified. Em told him for being so disgusting he had to pay for the cab, and surprisingly he did. We got dropped off at AMC and em and I walked back across the campus. Its dark, although there are lights, and very scary at night. We were hoping that security would come and say hello or something, but they didn't. halfway across a really dark section of grass em pipes up with 'hey do you remember that girl got raped last year, just down there.' grr so not the right thing to say!!

we made it home safely though. I cooked some noodles for us and we had a little debrief about the night before falling into bed about 3.30.

So far today we woke up, ate some stuff, and went shopping at kmart. It was about all either of us could manage. No hangover but just feel really buggered.

Okay I've run out of things to write now. I might go do the washing up.

just dropped into town to check out a new store i heard about and omg its like heaven.

they have a sale on, and even without the sale stuff is hell cheap. I have never been in a clothing store before where not only have I loved practically every single item I saw, but they have every single item in my size. very very happy.

I just bought four dresses, 3 party dresses and a casual one, for $82. I got a gorgeous short silver satin dress, a cute green pinafore dress with little pockets, a maxi dress in greens and blues, and a very nice floor length strapless pink and black dress. the pink and black one is like something my barbie would have worn when I was a kid but its actually kinda hot.

so now I have the dilemma of what to wear tomorrow night?!?! its only a party up at catherines with the usual crowd but its nye so I should wear something special. I might go the green and blue long dress, but I'm considering the pink and black one, even though its a bit dressy.

we shall see :)

oh and apparnetly they have a store in launnie too ;) heh yay! hello shopping trips during the year :D"

anyone who knows me at all will know how excited this makes me. I am such an animal person. As much as I love puddles the budgie, shadow the siamese fighting fish, and my two goldfish, they aren't quite as cool as a dog or a cat.

I have had to put off getting any real pets becuase of my retarded living situation - launnie and hobart, two houses, all that jazz. But Al and I were talking about it and decided that seeing as I have another 7 weeks of uni holidays, thats enough time to get a dog reasonably trained before I have to start going back up to school. I'm only working casual so it can get used to being alone for a few hours a day before it has to deal with 8-5 while als at work and I'm in launnie.

When we go away, like to Launnie for a weekend, or when we go up to Jamie's wedding, then we can always ask chloe to come and stay here and dog sit (until she goes on her big trip away, but thats not till april anyway). So we have to organise a fence of some description and then we can start looking :D

It will be a shelter puppy, of course. That's something about all my pets, they've all been shelter animals. expect merlin the bunny and sid the guinea pig, they were petshop boys, but the rest of my animals have been rescued. If we were getting a labrador or a big dog then I'd probably be okay with getting it from a breeder but we only want a littleish doggy, we dont have enough room for a big dog. We'll get a big dog when we get some land, but thats a while off yet.

yay its so exciting :) hehe. Unsure what breed we'll be getting. I personally *love* staffys, but Al doesn't like them, and they do require a lot of exercise and get very bored on their own. Jack russels are a bit too hyper for us. It really depends on whats in the shelter when we go, but we both want to get a young dog. (Although to be honest, my heart always goes out to the older dogs in the shelters, cause you just know they'll be the last ones to be adopted.)

Maybe we could get a big dog if it was older, but it would need to be house trained, cause big adult dog pee is a lot worse to deal with than puppy pee on the carpet lol.

yeah so thats my news for today. Now I gotta get back to writing my essay for summer school. I've written 500 words, only 1000 to go. bleh.

"event","I feel very.. refreshed? clear? something. happy, anyway.

I've just gone through my wardrobe and chest of drawers to get rid of some clothes. I did it a couple of weeks ago and got rid of one bag of clothes. Today I was a lot more brutal, and managed to get another 2 bags of clothes and a bag of shoes. Big garbage bags. The vinnies people are gonna think its christmas.

Its probably about a thousand dollars worth of clothes, if not more. I briefly considered selling it on ebay but then i'd have to hang on to the clothes for however long and post it and thats all hassle, when maybe some less fortunate people out there would like to buy brand name clothes and shoes for $5 a pop.

Its stuff that I haven't worn in ages. A handful of things still had the tags on but if i haven't worn them in a year, I'm not gonna start now am I. Some of the things I was hanging on to purely for sentimental reasons. like 'aww thats the dress I wore to NYE 2004, when such and such happened...' or 'ohh those trousers came from england and remind me of working at boots'. lol. Not very valid reasons to keep clothes.

So I feel refreshed and happy, my wardrobe finally has some order to it, all my clothes I wear actually fit in my drawers (for ages they have been shoved in badly or stacked on the floor next to my dresser as they dont fit) and I've done something good to fellow mankind. lol.

Now I'm just sitting down to enjoy a toasted sandwich before dropping my timesheet into work, getting petrol for the weekend (two huge days of work), grabbing some sour cream for our fajitas tonight and then I reckon I'll start cleaning up the spare room. 

I've been living here for ages but I still haven't got all my shit sorted out. Although coming back from launnie for the summer didn't really help. Thats okay though, I'm loving having so much free time now. I'm working a couple of splits next week which is a killer but the money will be great, and I have 3 days off so thats all good.

"event","Well, I am a slacker for not writing for ages.

I got the job. I got it the day of the interview. They basically said they would love to have me on board, and the interview was only to make sure that I was not some kind of psycho hehe. and to get the paperwork sorted out. So that is really really cool. They are totally happy to work around my uni hours, I start after exams have finished, next year they can even look at giving me some launnie shifts for the days I'm up here. Because its a nationwide company it makes that kinda thing a lot easier. I'm very excited. Should be a fantastic job, a lot more variety with what I'm doing, and if i want to go on to do community nursing and I like it enough I can hopefully stay on at the same company.

So I quit my other job, which is actually kinda sad. I miss my clients a bit. you get to know people really well working in that kind of industry so its hard knowing that I'm going to miss out on seeing them again. I can go back and visit them though, it's not like I left on bad terms or anything, would be good to drop by in a few weeks and see how everyone is going.

Al and I got a bird. hehe. She is a cute as little budgie. She's lovely, only a baby, a lovely grey colour and a great personality. She has been my study buddy all week. She is extremely entertaining. Her name is Puddles.

umm what else is news?

I have my first exam tomorrow. ARGH! its bio, and only worth 35% so not too bad, but its the hardest exam. even though its worth the least, I have to remember the most. I think I'll be fine though. I have a second bio exam tuesday afternoon, and a health one on thursday. then two more exams next week and i'm done for the year! besides summer school, but thats online stuff so no more travelling to and from launnie and being away from Albert.

Talking of Al, we went on an adventure yesterday. Exam study has meant I've barely left the house all week, besides to take breaks in the sunshine in this beautiful weather we've been having. So we jumped in the car and decided to go and get lost. it worked. well, I was lost anyway, but my sense of direction is stuffed. We took my cameras with us just in case we found something fun. Went out through ferntree and kept going, through longley and ended up in tinderbox. stopped in a little cemetery on the way, to have an explore. got some wicked shots, I was having a ball, had my SLR, new digital and my medium format camera. It was a lovely graveyard, if such a thing exists. Lots of families in there. it wasn't spooky at all though, was nice. There was only one area that was a bit icky, where there were a couple of fresh graves and there was a smell and it wasn't very nice at all.

We went and played on tinderbox beach, and I got some awesome photos walking around on the rocks. From there we drove back into kingston and played there for a bit, then headed homewards. We got home about 8.30 i think. was heaps of fun :)

anyway I think its about bed time, early night for me, going for a walk with sammy in the morning then some revision before bio.

He came in from sydney 4 days ago, and now he lives in a pretty glass bowl on our mantelpiece. He has some nice rocks and a plant, too. He's a bit shy, he hides behind the plant whenever you go near him, but I managed to get a couple of photos. He'll get braver I reckon.

I just love the way they look when they hang, like he sort of sits suspended in the middle of the bowl and his beautiful tail fans out and he looks amazing. He can see my other goldfish in the tank next to him and gets a bit fiesty, making himself all big to scare them off.

Our first pet together, hehe. The goldfish moved in with me but this is the first living thing thats arrived in our home while we've been living together. Besides the plants, of course, and they are starting to flower beautifully lol.

We might be getting a bird tomorrow, except we cant work out where one would go. We haven't got a lot of free space for a bird cage. Al's sister has got baby budgies though, aww, and I want one. Al hates budgies though. We might just have to stick with Mr. Fish for now hehe.

Isn't he beautiful? The prettiest greeny blue colour. I almost got one that was a cream colour with a lilac tail but this guy is so stunning I couldn't resist.

Anyway I better go to bed, my non-tonsils have white lumps and my throat is sore. cannot afford to get a throat infection right now, so sleep is good. :)

"event","well, its been a while.

Al and I have been living together for a month now, and its all going really really well. He's away tonight on a boys trip up to the lakes. I have the house to myself and its cool. First night I've spent alone here since moving in, and its not so bad. It feels like home, which is awesome.

I went for coffee with Emily this morning which was good, first chance we've had to properly catch up in a while. ended up spending 2 hours settled in to the couch at gloria jeans haha. that was good to see her and catch up on all the goss.

Then I came back and was all domesticated, did the washing and got wood in for the fire and so on. Did a fair bit of study too. I got the bus down yesterday from Launnie and it was actually really good, spent the whole two and a half hours studying.

Exams are in 4 weeks time, scary stuff. but in 5 and a half weeks time it will all be over! yay for that. Then i have a wicked long holiday. Having said that though I am doing summer school this year, but only 2 subjects. They are third year ones so it means that when 3rd year rolls around I only have 2 subjects for the year instead of 4. That will be awesome. The subjects I'm doing are online ones so wont take up much of my time, I'll still have a wicked summer holiday.

Sammy, Em, Al and I are going on a roadtrip sometime in November, hopefully. Sammy hasn't seen much of tasmania so we're gonna spend about 10 days going round and seeing the sights. And in January the girls and I are going to melbourne for a shopping trip, will be great.

I'm watching 'so you think you can dance' at the moment. Its a pretty cruddy show, but it makes me want to get into dancing. I've been going to Jam classes at the gym which is a combination of hip hop, latin and rnb moves. Its heaps of fun and according to Sam I have the hip thing going on alright lol. I'd love to learn how to do proper latin dancing, and hip hop is just fun.

I was gonna buy us a rabbit today. I've been hassling al for a while now that I want a pet, for when I'm home alone. He reckons I'll never be home alone but tonight proves him wrong haha. I would love a pet rabbit. Merlin was a wicked pet, I had him litter trained and everything. But we dont have a hutch or anything and I dont have all that much money at the moment, been spending a lot of time studying and its come before work a few times, so dont have money to waste on things. I'm coping fine, just dont have a lot of spare money. And as well as that we dont have any fences n stuff out the back and I dont really want my bunny to get stolen. One day I'll get one though.

When we buy or build a place, we're gonna get a dog. A real dog not a poncy little thing. I want a labrador, they are beautiful, or a border collie or something. Thats a while off yet though.

Man, either the presenter on this show is ginormously tall or all the contestants are shortarses. she's like, over a head higher than anyone else on the show.

anyway, bed time now. Got my last day of prac placement for the semester tomorrow.

bollocks, its just started pouring with rain and I've got all the washing out on the line. well I'm not going out to get it now lol.

last night was my sister Chloe's 21st birthday, was a great night, really really fun.

but thats not the news :P

Al and I have been talking for a little while about me moving in with him. I practically live there anyway, but at the moment all my stuff is spread between three houses and its hard to feel settled anywhere, drives me nuts. we were going to wait until summer because it seemed like the 'right' thing to do. but i talked about it with mum and dad, and on friday night was talking to als sister and her husband about it and all of them were pretty much saying why wait? if it feels right it feels right thats all there is to it.

so we talked about it some more and decided that we are both ready to move in together already. I have a weeks break at the end of this week so next weekend I'll be moving in to his place. all very exciting. Thursday I have free so I'll start dragging my stuff out of storage and going through it all, getting out whatever I  want to have at als place and everything else can be sorted through and put back into storage, pretty much.

its strange how not strange it all seems. I mean we've been together 2 months (to the day, actually) and we're moving in together. but it feels so normal and I'm so much happier with him than I've ever been with anyone else.

I now get what people mean when they say you just know when you've met the right person. and why it cant be explained.

One of the residents, who has fairly advanced dementia, was in the dining room today. her husband came in, I was sitting there talking to her about things, in that disjointed conversation that dementia residents have. Her husband was in a wheelchair as he's recently been in hospital and our hallways are mega long.

When he saw her, he leapt out of the wheelchair and swooped on her in a great big hug, and gave her a kiss. Her whole face lit up, her eyes were sparkly and everything. And the smile on her face was beautiful. pure love.

He took his golf cap off and put it on her head, and they sat there holding hands and talked for about two hours. and he talked the way she does, going with her conversation, rather than trying to make her talk 'normally'.

It was so beautiful to watch. I want to be like that one day, to have someone who loves me despite my age and fading abilities, and who makes my face light up like that.

Cleaned up the house yesterday to make it all nice and pretty, gotta rearrange some furniture - we're putting the armchairs in the hallway to both add seating (to free up the lounge room a bit) and to put across mine and rhys' bedroom doors. Neither of us want to find random people shagging in our beds :P and he's got a massive TV and I've got my stereo system that we want to protect. Gonna move the coffee table out of the way, spread the beanbags out around the lounge room, we've got a table set up in the study for the decks. Apparently someone is bringing lights and a smoke machine too.

Meegan is coming round in a couple of hours with a bottle of champagne because she wont be able to make it to the party, no babysitter, so that'll be fun. and Sammy is coming round for tea and to get ready here beforehand. I think Anthony is coming up around 4.30 too, he's gonna help us move the chairs etc.

I think we're gonna clean the shed up a bit too - normally parties are out there but its too cold now heading into winter - so that people can go out there for smokes and so on. Gonna have to lock the cat up somewhere too so she doesn't run away, the doors will probably be open all night and its cracker night so she'd freak.

For ten days on the island, all our advertising billboards in the city have been replaced by big red signs with stark white writing, and on them are things written by people from Tasmania, including refugees.

"event","I thought mice were supposed to be scared of people and crossing open spaces?

I'm sitting in my lounge room, trying (oh so hard, obviously) to study, and the little mouse who is living in our fireplace has just popped his head over the step to the office and run across the floor, right in front of me, to the fireplace. He's a bit blonde, I think, because he keeps running between the fireplace and the study, and back again. Maybe he's on drugs. Maybe he's on a sugar high from all the chocolate he keeps eating. He does go behind the tv, which is a bit more clever of him, but a couple of times he dashes right across the room.

He stopped to sniff the peanut butter trap a moment ago and I was mentally begging him not to get killed. Yeah, I set the trap, but I dont want to actually see him get killed. If it wasn't so unhygenic, and I wasn't so afraid of us ending up with a population of baby mice in our house, I'd quite like to keep him.

I've found out where he's getting in and out of the fireplace now, and how he gets from here into Rhys' room.

He's only a tiny little thing, one of those small field mice. Could be worse. It could be a rat. Yuck.

I wonder if my bioscience teacher will understand that I didn't study because I was mousewatching? I dont think so, somehow.

Better go.

"event","well kiddies, give me a pat on the back, I just got 100% for my first assessment. Admittedly it was just a bio quiz, 11 questions, resubmittable, and only worth 5% of my overall mark. but hey. I'm proud of me. I think its a good start to the year to get 100% on my first one.

so, yay for me :)

that was all...

Sorry for the serious lack of entries lately, once we get the internet back on in Launnie I should be around a bit more.

For the next week though I wont be online, the net is getting reconnected up there at the end of the week.

wish me luck, I'll give you all a big update next weekend I'm sure!

'Love is a special way of feeling'

<i>Love is a special way of feeling...

It is the safe way we feel
when we sit on our mother's
lap with her arms around us
tight and close.

It is the good way we feel
when we talk to someone
and they want to listen
and don't tell us to go away
and be quiet.

It is the happy way we
feel when we save a
bird that has been hurt...
or feed a lost cat...
or calm a frightened colt.

Love is found in unexpected places...
it is there in the quiet moment
when we first discover
a beautiful thing...
when we watch a bird
soar high against
a pale blue sky...
when we see a lovely flower
that no one else has noticed...
when we find a place
that shelters us and is
all our very own.

Love starts in little ways...
It may begin the day
we first share our
thoughts with someone else...
or help someone who needs us...
Or, sometimes, it begins
because, even without words,
we understand how someone feels.

Love comes quietly...
but you know when it is there,
because, suddenly...
you are not alone any more...
and there is no sadness
inside you.

Love is a happy feeling
that stays inside your heart
for the rest of your life.</i>


'A friend is someone who likes you'

<i>A friend is someone who likes you.
It can be a boy...
It can be a girl...
or a cat...
or a dog...
or even a white mouse.

A tree can be a different kind of friend.
It doesn't talk to you, but you know it likes you,
because it gives you apples...
or pears... or cherries...
or, sometimes, a place to swing.

A brook can be a friend in a special way.
It talks to you with splashy gurgles.
It cools your toes and lets you sit
quietly beside it when you don't feel 
like speaking.

The wind can be a friend too.
It sings soft songs to you at night
when you are sleepy and feeling lonely.
Sometimes it calls to you to play.
It pushes you from behind as you walk
and makes the leaves dance for you.
It is always with you wherever you go,
and that's how you know
it likes you.

Sometimes you don't know who are your friends.
Sometimes they are there all the time,
but you walk right past them
and don't notice that they like you
in a special way.

And then you think you don't have any friends.

Then you must stop hurrying and rushing so fast...

and move very slowly,
and look around carefully,
to see someone who smiles at you 
in a special way...
or a dog that wags its tail extra hard
whenever you are near...
or a tree that lets you climb it easily...
or a brook that lets you be quiet
when you want to be quiet.
Sometimes you have to find your friend.

Some people have lots and lots of friends..
and some people have quite a few friends..

but everyone...
everyone in the whole world
has at least </i>one<i> friend.

Where did you find yours?</i>"

haha local weather.. currently 4C, feels like 1C. expecting a high of 7. poor buggers.. makes todays 23 seem like heaven. as much as i miss it, i sure dont miss the weather. i reckon i'll go back and visit everyone next year, if i can afford it, around june when its a bit nicer over there. just spend a couple of weeks there, maybe longer. i know once i'm there i wont want to leave again.

i miss lunch at Yates's with beckie, rugged up in our huge fluffy jackets against the cold, drinking half pints of beer on our lunch break. and her stairs, her flat is on the third floor and the stairs go straight up, spiralling but so steep, it takes forever to get up there and you have to run before the hall light timer switches off and you stumble in the dark. i miss the friendly bus drivers, and the solid feel of a pound coin in my hand. i even miss the group of underagers who were always hanging around outside the fish and chip shop in southam when i got home from work on a friday.

as if i'm not gonna go back there one day :)

thats the southam website, where i lived.

awww i just like looking at the pictures going 'i've been there!!' hehe.. 

lol that reminds me, the other night at the carlyle i looked up at the tele and airport or one of those shows was on, they were talking to some passenger guy and it was in luton airport, and i said 'i've slept there!' paul and liz both nearly fell of their chairs, they thought i was gonna say 'i've slept with him!' lol. yeah, the chances of the guy i slept with in england being on the tv? impossible :)

shearer is finally awake so i'm off

You always seem to have a hot date, even though you never try to meet anyone.
A total charmer, you have a natural appeal that keeps you in high demand.

Your ideal Valentine's Day date: multiple dates with multiple people

Your flirting style: 100% natural

What turns you off: serious relationship talks

"event","I love weekend newspapers, so much.

""Perhaps the first great literary explanation of love comes from Plato. In the <i>Symposium</i>, along with discussion of various other unimportant topics (immortality, the origins of universal creativity), he explains that at the dawn of time, human creatures were egg-shaped, with four arms, four legs and two heads. Some were hermaphrodite, some all-male, and some all-female - thus accounting for homosexual as well as heterosexual love. Fearing their power and their perfect happiness, the gods split them in two. And ever since, we've all been seeking our original matching halves. 'And when one of them meets with his other half,' explains Plato, 'the actual half of himself... the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy, and will not be out of the other's sight... even for a moment: these are the people who pass their whole lives together.'""



""Love, I think, is like faith - by definition inexplicable to anybody else. You can't isolate it, or propogate it, or follow it back to its source - in either a laboratory or a love poem. You feel it, therefore it is: inevitable, recognisable."""

"event","i had the most beautiful dream last night. it was definitely the best dream i have had in my entire life.

i woke up from it this morning with a huge smile on my face, curled back down in my blankets and thought back over it all. i love when i remember the good dreams.

and i'm holding it close to me today in my mind, and every now and then letting my imagination slip back to it so i can feel that warm cosy feeling i had this morning. not too often, i dont want the loving feeling to wear off, but often enough to keep me glowing."

"event","course is paid for, it was less than half what i thought it'd be, so i dunno if maybe the office lady only enrolled me in half the units i should be doing or what. who knows! and i have my first aid course this thursday and friday. only problem with that is i have to drop my payment claim into centrelink on friday and the course is all day. i guess i'll just have to race to the rosny one on my lunch break if i get one.

i'm thinking about doing a course in small business management too, and take advantage of the whole capped fees thing that tafe have going on. you can do that course online so i wouldn't have to worry about classes clashing with aged care. but then i guess i should focus on one thing at a time. but i can be an aged carer and run a small business in my spare time.

i'll think about that some more anyway.

"event","SO I need to get a few things off my chest...

First off, I'd like to give a huge high five to most of my girlfriends that have dumped their shitty ass boyfriends to better themselves or to be that special other.  These girls know who they are and really deserve a big pat on the back for ....well, first, putting up with their asshole boyfriends, and second, being able to finally kick them to the curb!
Anyways, bravo for standing up for yourselves and getting the man that you deserve!

Second of all....I found out that my loser ex-boyfriend found himself a new female.  I was very excited to find this out.  However, I've come to find out that she's 15 years old......and he's 23.

I had a really long talk with him before this about finding himself a classy woman that is around his age.  But, then I came to realize that no living female above the age of 20 would want to put up with a person like him.  The boy has no goals in life and basically hasn't put any forward movement into life.  He has a band consisting of all 15-17 year old kids that are his cult that follow him around.
Anyways, point being....I'm half way tempted to blow up on his stupid ass to help him realize what he is getting himself into......But then I started to wonder if I actually cared if he gets arrested and put on the sex offender's list....or if it was just me wanting to prove someone ignorant and wrong.  I've come to the point of not caring...but, I am slightly offended.
See, we had a very long conversation about women and how to be able to find one without going to bars or clubs.  I was basically shooting in the dark with effort, but it seemed to get through to him rather well.  He thanked me every way and told me that it inspired him.  Needless to say, I was shooting in the dark and it got nowhere but into a little girl's pants.

So, my life feels a little more crushed knowing that my efforts were for not.  But, my life is brighter with the knowledge that my ex could end up on the Illinois Sex Offender List!

So, keep your eyes open kids!  Who knows....the next sexual predator could be your local Subway sandwich maker!  :P"

"event","Snow Snow Snow Snow!!  Talk about crazy insane!

Thursday was unbelievable.  I was watching to storm the entire time because my boyfriend wanted to come and visit.  It is about a 3 hour drive from the St. Louis area.  It took him about 6.  I was scared the entire time and fighting back tears.  Scared shitless....but, he made it here alive and shaken from it.  I about burst into tears....but, I did pretty good at holding it back.

Friday came with the announcement of a snow day.  I was pretty excited by it, however I had a presentation to do that day and a test.  I was completely ready for the presentation, but screw the test!  Anyways, the day was lazy and eventful except for trying to get Abby's car out of the snow.  Which didn't happen.  We had to call a tow truck.  Then Dylan left at 6:00 am to get to work on time.  I felt so bad.

Saturday (last night) was so nuts.  Maddy, James, Derek and I ended up at the Pace at 10:45 at night.  The boys got carded twice at the bar which was basically crawling with cops.  It got to 2:00 am and we had to leave.  So, we go outside to find even more cops.  I ended up seeing what I thought was a cat fight....but, ended up being a cop wrestling a drunk (probably underage) girl to the ground.  I guess she was cooperating very well and the maced the chick.  Then, another girl was slammed against a cop car getting arrested also.  NUTS!

I am here procrastinating and eating sushi.  Which was also an adventure trying to park and getting stuck in the snow.....ugh.  Never again.  Anyways, I'm lazy an watching animal planet.  Sorry for the randomness!!"

*Sigh*....it really sucks living this far apart (even though it's not as bad as it could be).&nbsp; It'll suck even more if we have to live even farther apart.&nbsp; Someday, I wish I could come home from work and find him here.&nbsp; That would kick ass!

I got accepted into Western Illinois University (WIU).&nbsp; Pretty excited about it.&nbsp; I'll be going to school with Annette, Cooge, and Maddy.&nbsp; Hopefully one of them needs a roommate!

Goals are getting completed rather quickly.&nbsp; Goal 1 got done today.&nbsp; I looks pretty neat.&nbsp; I like it alot!&nbsp; Goals 2,5, and 7 are getting done alot this month and next.&nbsp; Dylan is coming to see me tomorrow!&nbsp; And goal 9 will be completed soon.&nbsp; My uncle is getting me a really good deal on Canon so hopefully I'll get that this month.

Zach is in town for the next month.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that I'll be over at the house plenty this month.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Damn....it's a busy month.&nbsp; Also, I'm trying to make my room more comfortable.....or just more like my dorm.&nbsp; More of my draws are going up, Christmas lights are strung up and most of my college crap is being moved into John's old bedroom.&nbsp; Basically, my room is my sanctuary again.....

So the goals are getting somewhat done.&nbsp; Some of them might not happen this summer....like the painting and the ""Divine Comedy"".&nbsp; The reason is because I'm working on others harder.

Zach will be here in a few days, which I'm pretty excited about!&nbsp; I'll have someone to hang out with.&nbsp; It hasn't been hard, but people's schedules are all kinds of everywhere.&nbsp; And since I have to get up early, I don't want to stay out to late...considering how busy we are.

I've been really emotional lately......I think it's just PMS.

Tomorrow, I hope to go out to the lake.&nbsp; Mat has a boat and guess a bunch of us (Michelle, Lynde, Bermy) will be going out there.&nbsp; Woo hoo.

"event","This is a short update for the past week or two.

SLU is out of the picture.  My financial aid came through.  However, it was far from enough.  With work study, I would have gotten $15,500 in grants, loans, and work study program.  Without it, it would have been $12,900.  This leave me and my parents with about $27,000 to make up for.  We just don't have that kind of money floating around somewhere.  So, I won't be going.....

However, I sent all my information to Northern University in Dekalb, which is about an hour outside of Chicago.  The downside to this is that I'll be about, 3-5 hours away from my family, friends, and Dylan.  The upside, this university would be a better college for my anyways....and cheaper.  My dad talked to the head of the National Weather Service in Illinois.  He was taking a forecasting class that this guy was teaching.  Anyways, after the class, my dad told him about my conundrum and asked which college would be better, SLU or Northern?  The guy laughed and said that Northern would be a better choice.  The reason:  SLU offers more in the research aspect of Meteorology.  They know mathematics and the dynamics of a storm, however, they can't forecast worth shit.  Yet, Northern is more about forecasting and storm chasing.  My dad told me this and it was like a weight lifted off my shoulders.  I was so happy to know this.  So, my dad sent me his info and I emailed him thanking him for his input.  And I guess that now this guy wants me to come to the offices in Lincoln to check out the place and maybe sign up for an internship!  The news just gets better!

Anyways, that makes me happy....but, now, I have to have another long distance relationship.  But, we talked and he's more than willing to make things work!  He might even go to Columbia in Chicago sometime in the near future!  Yay, film schools!

Crisis dealt with.

Tomorrow, I leave for Ska Weekend!  I'll be back on Sunday...which leaves me time to study for my final on Tuesday.  However, I still have a project to get done for my art class.  Stupidest thing ever....

Well,.....I'll be back Sunday!"

So, from my last update.  Person with the shitty boyfriend is still staying with him.  Don't ask me why.....she just is......

Obviously, I got accepted into SLU.  I'm pretty excited about this.  It's going to be hard, but right now we're just trying to figure out how we are going to pay for all this.  For a year at SLU with most thing included, it's about $35,000.  It's way to much for us.  I hope financial aid comes through on this for me.  I might be in debt the rest of my life!

Anyways, on a lighter note....my birthday is in 6 days!  This weekend I'll be heading home to celebrate Easter and my birthday.  Plus, I'll be taking Dylan with me!  It shall be interesting....I can see it now....Adam and Dylan playing games till 4 in the morning!  Sweet.....

Then, on Monday (which is the 17th...my real birthday), Dylan is throwing me a party at his town house.  Anyone is welcome if they feel like driving to Collinsville for the night!

Then a weekend later.....SKA WEEKEND!!!!  Need I say more.  By the way...who decided to throw the Tosser on the list?  I figured out the reason why....I just don't understand.  Oh well...."

It seems like college is getting to that point of not being enjoyable anymore.  It is now school, and that's it for me.  Everything outside of school is what I consider ""college"". SIUE can lick my ass.....

Why you wonder?  Well, as I was sitting in my room, staring out the window on this beautiful day and getting ready to type up my theater paper, I got to wondering....""Why the hell am I in a theater class?  What does theater have to do with Meteorology?  And why am I in that stupid fucking history class?  How are any of these relevant to my major?""  After thinking about this I got pissed off at myself for choosing those classes.  I got pissed at the administrators for not doing their jobs.  After the angry comments and thoughts......I now hate this place.  I don't enjoy it anymore.

The crappy thing?  I have to keep up my grades no matter what.  I have to suffer through these dumb classes in order to keep up my grades to transfer.  And to generally stay in school.  My parents will pull me out of college if my GPA isn't at or above a 3.0.  The only reason of me not breaking my point of insanity is either my classes being canceled, or I skip.  And I hate it when I don't go to class.  I feel like I'm worthless.....but I can't stand my classes.

Speaking of Ska Weekend....BIG D AND THE KIDS TABLE!!!!  I can't wait now!  At first I was a little worried about the past line up, but now that they and The Flatliners are on main stage....my life is complete!

Next year I'll hopefully be transferring out of SIUE.  The possibly is SLU, but I went ahead and sent in the application to Oklahoma anyways.  I'm curious if I'll get accepted or not.  With the research I did, I'll most likely get in.  However, I found out that with both schools, I'll have to send in my transcripts from SIUE.  The bogus thing?.....it cost money to send them to the colleges!!  It's a piece of paper with grades.  Fucking bullshit.......  I know that there's reasons for the costs and what not, but still....ridiculous...

Valentine's Day went well this year!  I've always had an extreme hate for this day.  But it seems like everyone else doesn't like it either.  However, I don't like it because I think it's a silly day.....most others don't like it because they're bitter.  Anyways, I got my titty bear!!!  I was quite excited to get him.  Plus, he's massive and fun to cuddle with! <3  I also got flowers and a card!  The big upside...it was nice outside so we went to a park.....downside....it got fucking windy and cold by the time we got to play around.  However, we still had a fun time!

"event","Internet ordering is the most convenient system known to man.  John got me a Bets Buy gift card for Christmas and I just spent it on a CD and DVD.  Right on....

I'm kind of disappointed by the Ska Weekend line up.  At first glance and seeing Catch 22, I was kind of excited......Until I remembered their live DVD and how much it sucked.  Then I gave some of the other bands a listen too.  The Know How sound pretty good......but I Voted For Kodos doesn't really trip my trigger.  Dylan was telling how he saw them last year and said something about their music going down hill.  I gave it a listen and wasn't impressed.  However, now the Pietasters are on.  At least there's some hope.....  If MU330 and Big D could get on, my life would be complete!

Classes are going pretty well.  I wasn't able to drop my art class.  I sucked it up and I'm getting my work done.  The professor is pretty impressed.  We'll see how the rest of the semester goes.  I have high hopes.  Plus, a class with Dyl, Justin, and Lana ""Art is not free!!"" Hagan......doesn't get much better!

I've been listening the hell out of old RCR, Suburban Legends, Bomb the Music Industry, and Arrogant Sons of a Bitches.  I'm addicted.

Anyone heard of Ska Circus?  It's in Las Vegas and seems pretty damn expensive.  However, the line up is pretty fucking awesome.  But the money issue blows ass.  Oh well.....

I think I'm done......fuck off.  <3"

New Years Eve non-party was sooooo much fun!  I'm very glad that I went.  Also, I met an entire crowd of bad asses!!

Anyways....I really have nothing to say.....Just felt like writing.

Date with Dylan on Friday!  <3"

"event","Updates seem to be rare for me these days.  Live journal seems to blow more and more every time I happen upon it's existence.

An uneventful Christmas break so far.  My entire schedule is full of mad scientist work.  However, the majority of it is sitting at the desks and staring at a blank computer screen for a good half hour to only have Ryan throw a backlog in front of me and say, ""Run this sample for me.""  Usually I'd be excited, but it takes me 10 minutes to calibrate the instrument and another 5 to run the sample (depending on the tests that need to be run).  Afterward, I go back to my little spot at the desk and go back to staring at that computer screen.  Thank you EPA for sending us diddly squat.  

The rest of break should be interesting....

Speaking of interesting.....Dylan came to visit me on Tuesday!  Adventures in Springfield really are not as fun as Collinsville and the surrounding cities.  However, we managed to have ourselves fucking bad ass time, minus the Plunket show that really wasn't as good as I hoped.  And as Dylan nicely put it...""They can keep my 5 dollars.  I just want my life back.""  Anyways, the adventures ensue for New Years Eve when the ""Dylanglea Fest 2005 1/2"" party takes place back in Collinsville.  A large non-alcoholic party with plenty sugar to clog the arteries!  And don't forget the craptacular movie line up that will take place all night!  FUCK YES!

I miss him already!

Anyways.....other than work and a boyfriend.....that seems to be the extent of my break.

Merry fucking Christmas!  Hallelujah!...holy shit!"

"event","Finally got new cell phones over break.  Maybe now when people call me at home, I won't have to ask them to repeat themselves every minute.  Plus, it works better down here at school.  About god damn time....

I'm working through another art block again.  My current ceramics class has kept me busy, but the long nights of having a fresh pad of paper in front of you with nothing to draw kind of gets on my nerves.  I've been working on the a sketch of Chuq from a picture that I took awhile back.  The sketch is good on paper, but I'd really like to get it on canvas.  My hopes are to paint it and have it look relatively nice.  However, knowing my painting capabilities worries me.  We'll see what happens with it.  I really want it to look nice.

Seems like my fish has survived the trials of starving for about 10 days.  I left him here over break with the hopes of his surviving through the week.  He made it!  What a trooper..

Speaking of ceramics, I was able to get a certain person's gift done for their birthday.  I hope said person likes it.

Damn Christmas.......I loathe shopping for the holidays.  While some have fun, I cannot see the joy in running from store to store, bumping elbows with everyone around you to the that ""hot item"" on the list, and then proceed to wait in line for hours on end just to move to the next store and do it all over again.  Forget it.  Internet shopping, here I come.  I'd rather enjoy my shopping experience for others.

Speaking of pains......finals.  Need I say more.  

However, I must stay above a 3.0 in order for me to go to Nepal next year.  Seems as though plans are moving smoothly.  All I have to do is get into a Climatology class for next semester and I should be set.  Now comes forms and scholarships......But I'm ready to go!  Earthquakes, cold, and Himalayas HERE I COME!!!!!

Oh life.  You taunt me so!"

I've been watching TLC's What Not to Wear.  I'm starting to feel more self-conscious because I see myself in alot of the girls that are on this show.  Michelle has told me before that she would love to put me on this show.  It would be great to find some clothes that are nice yet fit my style.  I guess I'm open for anything.  Does anyone have good fashion sense and $5,000 for me?

I wish I could get Adam and Chuck here for a weekend this month instead of next month.  Can anyone pretend to be Chuck for a weekend so I can get him down here before it gets cold out?  I'm pretty sure Adam is open to any weekend.  He's easy going.

Papers, projects, tests, quizzes.  Tis my life."

Before the Internet or the AIM

Before semi automatics and weed

Before playstation2 or X-bOX

Before the 5 hours of homework you put off every night...


Way back...


I'm talkin' bout hide and go seek at dusk.

Red light, Green light.

Playing kickball & dodgeball until your porch light came on.

Mother May I?

Red Rover

four square

Hula Hoops

Running through the sprinkler

Happy Meals

Getting the privilege to sit in the front seat of the car



Wait...

Watchin' Saturday Morning cartoons

Like Hey Arnold and Doug

Or what about legends of the hidden temple, global guts, double dare, and who, ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK!

Who could forget Snick

Or the teenage mutant ninja turtles,and Power Rangers,


Christmas morning...

Your first day of school

Bedtime Prayers and Goodnight Kisses



Climbing trees

Getting an ice cream off the ice cream truck

A million mosquito bites and sticky fingers

Jumpin' down the steps

Jumpin' on the bed

Pillow fights

Runnin' till you were out of breath

Laughing so hard that your stomach hurt and you almost peed your pants

Being tired from playin' all day

Your first crush...

Rainy days at school meant playing ""Heads up 7-Up"" in the classroom

Remember that?



I'm not finished yet...

Kool-Aid was the drink of the summer

Giving your friends a ride on your handlebars or spokes

Wearing your new shoes on the first day of school

Class Field Trips

When nearly everyone's mom was at home when the kids got there.

When getting high was swinging on the swingset

When $5 seemed like a million, and another dollar a Miracle.

When your parents took you to McDonalds and you were so cool.

When Toys r Us overruled the ""mall""


I want to go back to the time when...

Decisions were made by going ""eeny-meeny-miney-moe""

Mistakes were corrected by simply exclaiming, ""do over!""

""Race issue"" meant arguing about who ran the fastest.

Money issues were handled by whoever was the banker in ""monopoly""

Catching fireflies could happily occupy an entire evening

It wasn't odd to have two or three ""best"" friends.

Being old, referred to anyone over 20.

The worst thing you could catch from the opposite sex was cooties.

Nobody was prettier than Mom

Nobody was cooler than Dad

Scrapes and bruises were kissed and made better

It was a big deal to finally be tall enough to ride the ""big people"" rides at the amusement park.

Getting an inch of snow was a dream come true.

Abilities were discovered because of a ""double-dog-dare""

Spinning around, getting dizzy and falling down was cause for giggles.


If you can remember most or all of these, then you have LIVED!!!"

"event","I know that I don't usually update about weekends, but this one was update worthy.

Friday mainly consisted of driving.  My classes blew, due to the fact that I was late to all of them.  However, I was still in a good mood.  I went out to dinner with my dad and talked about the past 2 weeks.  It was nice to actually get to catch up with my dad instead of always my mom.  Anyways, I went and saw my baby and had an interesting night with dying hair.

Saturday was my grandma's birthday.  We went out to a friend-of-the-family's camping ground and had an awesome lunch.  I caught quite a few fish too!  Good times.......Then, the benefit show!  Holy shit!  What an amazing show!  Most of the bands that I heard did pretty well.  I kind of wish I would have been there for Solemn Vow.  Bastognes Best tore it up with the addition of my little brother as Exact Change Man!  It seemed by that time, all the ska scene kids wanted to bust out some moves.  And they did!!  Chuq was amazing at commanding the crowd!  He was a true rock star that night!  <3 :P  At a point in the night, they had a true western gun duel.  Some guy killed Exact Change Man, but was badass when he did it!  He did one of those James Bond roll moves and killed the poor bastard.  All in all, it was a great night!  Bravo to all the bands and all the kids that came to support local bands and the new cafe.

Sunday mostly consisted of shopping and packing up to leave.  I didn't get to see my boy because of another show, but I'll get to see him again some other time.

It was great to actually hang out with Adam on Saturday.  I'm glad him and I have a good relationship.  Better than wanting to kill him all the time!

<3 to everyone.  Classes tomorrow, sleep tonight."

"event","A scanner, a scanner, my kingdom for a scanner!

I have quiet a few new drawings that I have spit out on paper.  However, I lack the scanner to get them on my deviant art page.  People have been demanding!  How much are those things anyways?

My sketch book looks kind of mixed up.  I'll usually start on a picture and think of something better.  Or, I end up getting frustrated with the one I am on.  Instead of erasing it, I just start a new one.  Point is, I have alot of unfinished drawings that I should try to fix and finish.

I realized that there are way to many emo/goth kids here at school.  Obviously those fresh out of high school haven't gotten past that stage of growing up.  It seems kind of harsh to say that, but come on people!  You're 18/19 and an adult now!  Get out of those bondage pants and face paints!  To many people are laughing at you because you're stuck being 16!  This is college, not the mall!........Venting......and I'm pretty sure I'm going to get comments back saying that people are just trying to be individuals and express themselves.  However, it's not individuality when they all look like clones.

On that note, I'm going to go.     <3 rude boy!"

Because of this big ass hurricane that is going through the south, I have a big ass assignment for my Meteorology class that really rocks!  I have to watch the rain clouds that are currently coming in from the east and watch for rotations, currents, temperature, and cloud formation.  Also, I have to watch the news channels and look on the internet frequently to look at sea surge, barometric pressure, and wind speeds to determine what class/category hurricane that it is at this moment.  And by tomorrow, we have to have a prediction of the path of the hurricane through the states.  We're supposed to keep somewhat of a log of all of this.  We'll see how it goes.  But from what I see, those rain clouds won't be here until late tonight.  Fun!

I don' have a lot more to talk about.  Bastognes Best will have a show sometime this weekend!  Keep your eyes peeled for updates.  Support your local ska band!

I miss my rude boy.  <3 you Chuqqlz!"

"event","I'm back in college.  It seems strange to finally be back.  Even though I spent 9 months of my life here last year, it's still taking some time to get used to things again.

Our room is really nice.  The furniture is rearranged a different way and it looks alot nicer.  We are currently waiting for my mom to send us our Christmas lights to put around the room.  Also, we live in a quieter end of the hall.  Sort of away from the constant noise of where we were last year.

I was able to find all my classes today and I'm  pretty excited to see how things turn out with that.  Hopefully well.

So far I've made quite a few new friends here in the dorms.  Some are girls, but guys are the ones that are more social.  

With that, I must state my extreme dislike for so many people saying..""Oh, the guys are only being nice because they are hitting on you.""....Now, I'm not trying to sound naive and I know that some guys do just want a piece of ass, but honestly, can't a girl JUST be friends with a guy with no feelings involved?  I have a shit load more guy friends then girl friends and I'm know that not one of them sees me more than a friend.  I'm sick of hearing about it.  

I had to rant for a second....I feel better.  Anyways, I'm off.  I hope all the boys are having fun at Powerlight!  I miss you, Chuq!!!  I miss my boys!!  I miss the band!!"

Lets put it this way....take <i>The Boondock Saints</i> and <i>Tombstone</i>, mix those two movies together and set it in Detroit and you got this movie.  It's perfect for those who love vigil-anti killer movies.  Great great great!

School shopping in the morning.  Looks like I'm going to be busy most of the day.  Hopefully I'll get to the fair tomorrow.  If not, I can always pick a different day.  We'll see....

Wednesday is my last day at work.  Damn the EPA for not sending us our samples.  Looks like I'm working during Christmas break.  A few extra dollars in the pocket will be nice.

Leaving to school in a week.  Back to my home away from home.  I'll miss some people here.  Such as: Adam, John, the band, and of course Chuck.  However, I'll be glad to leave behind alot of people who I don't care to see anymore.  I can't wait to move back in with Michelle.  Maybe spending time away from each other during the summer was a good thing.  We'll see.....

I talked to a co-worker of mine that told me that they quit drinking because it got boring and they see how stupid it is to even start.  That it's only temporary and it gets old.  I told him that's why I will never start.

But if you're going to be a chicken shit coward and not come forward and say shit to my face and accept consequences, then fuck off and don't bother posting on here.  Be that coward that you are and put things on my live journal just so you can pretend to say ""I made a point"".

So, whoever was Mr. Anonymous that posted on my last entry won't have that option of posting anymore.  I really don't care what people say about me because I get shit like that all the time.  But when it doesn't include a name or face, then find somewhere else to bitch about me.  I honestly don't care.

I'm officially certified to run 5 different tests at work.  They are: Total Suspended Solids(TSS), Ammonia, pH, Percent Moisture(Pmoist), and Alkalinity.  I know that it probably means nothing to some, but for me, it's a pretty big deal.  It means that if I every pursue anything in the chemistry field, I'm certified to run these tests without training.  I'm pretty proud of myself to in getting this far.  Seems like I'll be home more often then I expected.....

So if you guys missed the first Bastognes Best show, there's going to be another one very very soon!  Keep your eyes open for updates on the who, when, and where.

"event","Bastognes Best was amazing last night.  I never knew that a band could set up like that and still draw a nice size crowd.  It's nice to see the many people who still support local music.  Even my mom said that she would have gone if she wasn't in Chicago at the time.  I love how she supports the arts.....including music.

I officially want to learn how to play an instrument(s).  I used to do piano.....but that was when I was in 5th grade.  I quit because my grades weren't doing well, and my parents thought it was me practicing piano to much.  They screwed me over on that one.  However, after seeing these guys do so well last night, I really want to learn how.  I just need to find someone who will have the time and patience to sit down and teach me.  This will be hard......

Why do people still throw the word ""love"" around so often?  I know about 3 people that are in new relationships.  It has been a week and they are already saying that they love the person they are with.  But is it really love?  Or is it just happiness?  Or is it finally getting the attention from a female/male that one has been striving for for to long?  Kids these days......

I'm also developing an extreme hate for whining.  People do and and they do it way to often.  Mostly about how their life sucks.  Go cry about it somewhere else emo kids.  Or find a way to fix it.  Fuck...

28 more days until I move back to school....  :D

"event","Life continues......not really much to say lately.  Things have been going well.  I haven't seen much of either of my brothers this summer.  I understand the reason with John.  However, it seems like I never get to see Adam much anymore.  Usually I get home from work and he's not home or he is and I have plans to go out somewhere.  But it's the same on the weekends too.  He's always upstairs playing those silly video games.....or he's in the basement on the computer.  If not that, he's out with friends.  Honestly.....I wish there was more that I could do to get him away from these stupid machines.  Seems like his life is run by games..........

My job is fantastic.  JP has offered for me to come back during breaks to work for him......or, basically, whenever he needs me.  He said that he's ""very proud of how far I have come"" and that I'm ""a dedicated and hard worker.""  Seems like everyone is proud of me!

I hate it how some people really don't care what happens to them.  Just as long as they get that something that makes them happy, they don't care.  I know of some guys that need to wake up or they will be in jail.

I love to be loved by someone I love and who loves me back!  Eat your heart out River City Rebels!

"event","Chicago was awesome!  I had a fantastic time there.  I never realized how much I love that city.  Even if traffic is a minor set back.

We ended up leaving home around 10 am.  We got to the hotel around 1:30.  The traffic was really backed up due to all the events that were going on.  We checked in and my mom and I meet up with my Aunt Anne there and headed down to the Taste of Chicago.  The food was wonderful and the weather wasn't hot at all.  After eating we ended up in Millennium Park and watched the Crown Park towers change pictures and shoot water from it.  It's hard to explain, but I recommend going.

We went to the park's grill and sat to have a drink for about 2 hours just watching the city.  After that we went to the Metro and watched the bands compete in Emergenza.  It was wild!  Maxlider did a really good job!  However, there were alot of other REALLY good bands that were there.  The great thing was, not all the bands were the same genre which was a bit of a relief.  I was afraid that I would be sitting through all hard rock bands.  But, there were punk, rock, hard rock, emo, new age rock, indy......etc.

But, in the end, the indy band got first, which wasn't a really big surprise because they were very very good.  Maxlider got 4th......however, they got the award for best visual and audio performance!  All in all, they were great!

So, basically, today, I woke up, ate breakfast, talked to Erik about going to see Velvet Revolver at the State Fair(which I think is a go), said our goodbyes, then came home.

Fun, sore.....all that jazz......"

I really miss Leah Jenner.  Talking on the internet just isn't the same.  I miss her laugh, because it's the kind that can make you laugh harder because it's so cute!  

I miss Christina also.  Unfortunately, I can't do much about it.  She's moving down to Georgia.  Dammit......

I miss Michelle too.  Seems kind of weird when I was able to see my best friend so often last summer.  It's almost the end of June and I've only seen her 3 times this summer.  It really does upset....

Streetlight Manifesto show was very very awesome.  Good times had by all.  Minus the ride back through a monsoon.

I heard someone say something today and it really made me laugh:
""A friend is someone who will bail you out of jail.  A best friend is the person sitting next to you saying, ""That was awesome!""

So true."

"event","its fuckin 8:30 in the morning and im wide awake. anyone who knows me, knows that i dont exist before noon. i went to bed at like 4 (as usual) but i could never get to sleep because my air conditioner was making all kinds of stupid noises. it was kind of a mix of like cricket chirps and mouthwash gargles. so im running all these reasons through my head why i cant turn it off...like the heat, obviously...and i realized that even if it was silent in the room i wouldnt fall asleep because the sun is really bright outside my window and i dont have any curtains (even with the blinds closed its bright as hell in there). and to top it all off, no matter where i sleep, its a gamble anymore because my legs twitch non-stop (i think its restless leg syndrome...but i have no insurance so i try to just suck it up and deal with it).

so, after i gave up and decided to start my day six hours early with no sleep at all, i got to wondering how i ever fall asleep at all, and why this last night was so different...because the more i think about it, these conditions arent new, theyre pretty much the norm...

and then i realized that this was one of maybe three nights in the past month/month and a half that i havent been wasted. apparently my room has been unfit to sustain human life for quite some time now, i just havent noticed/cared because ive just been passing out every night.

theres no real point to any of this, i just thought it was kinda funny how abuse and neglect just kinda worked everything out for me.

so i guess as long as i live in this house i cant go to bed sober.

i should have asked for curtains and a new AC for my bday.

fuck your free benefits, i wouldnt need them if you didnt make me kill myself every day. 
fuck your 401k...i dont feel like saving money yet anyway.

my boss has been saying all this shit to try and scare me into staying full time, but hes really just scared to lose people. cuz i can go over his head and talk to the people in the company who are actually involved with the shit hes talking about, and they tell me what i need to know. 

so im part time again soon. and if i find someting to do in the mornings, im switching to no time.

and im still trying to find anything good enough to keep me from going to college. cuz im starting to realize i probably should have done that lol. but im gonna go down fighting. theyll never take me alive."

Cast the calming apple 
Up and over satellites 
To draw out the timid wild one 
To convince you it's alright 
And I listen for the whisper 
Of your sweet insanity while I formulate 
Denials of your affect on me 

You're a stranger 
So what do I care 
You vanish today 
Not the first time I hear 
All the lies 

What am I to do with all this silence 
Shy away, shy away phantom 
Run away terrified child 
Won't you move away you fucking tornado
I'm better off without you

anyways, im realizing that my feelings dont really have the power to change anything. i've always kinda grown up thinking that if i believe in something strongly enough, and put forth the right effort, that anything is possible(whether i did this always or not is beside the point). but thats pretty childish and naive. and like i said before, everyone knows that...if you can look at a situation objectively and without bias. but i think that once you're involved in something, your vision gets kinda skewed.

so now im seeing a little more clearly, and admitting some things that i didnt even want to consider before.

"event","i think i might actually be starting to get my shit together. its a nice change of pace, because im used to fucking up on a regular basis...and shrugging it off as a lack of motivation. that kinda thing is tricky though, because saying im just unmotivated implies that its just something that i need to wait out, like itll come to me eventually. i think whats actually happening is im just growing up, and taking the necessary steps towards improving my standing in life. 

and my new favorite thing in the world is listening to the shit that people tell me with regards to my job, my home life, relationships, etc. people are very quick to point out things that they feel that im doing wrong, when in reality, they dont know shit about where im at. they assume that a five minute conversation gives them the entire back story on my life, and theyre the expert, with all the advice ill ever need. 

i didnt ask for it.
so fuck off. 
i was just sayin things,
and you're not supposed to. 

and i think also that those people need to examine their own shit before trying to fix mine. 

but anyways, im taking steps on some much-neglected details of my life, and biding my time on others. we'll see what happens, but i see good things ahead. cuz its high time for some better livin'."

"event","sometimes it takes me a while...
but i can be honest and own up to shit. 

its difficult because right and wrong seem to come from such scattered points of view nowadays. ""wrong"" to one person is only a slightly twisted and self-indulgent justification away from being what the other calls ""right"". 

the straight and narrow road may be hard to find...but i can get there.
its a pretty bitter-sweet thing. my needs/wants just need to be re-organized a bit."

"event","im pretty hungover...and i have to be at work soon. life is easy when you dont give a shit. 

here are some rules i try to follow as best i can:

dont start drama, there wont be drama. at least not the kind that you can put your finger on. you just gotta have 'dem eyez, son. cuz everybody else is already looking.

dont ever get attached to anything/anyone, and it wont hurt when it breaks off. 

its not defeat if you never try. and as for victory, dont even consider it. its probably overrated. 

and above all else, calm the fuck down."

"event","sometimes reading lj, like your friends page, can be like looking into the past with an all-knowing perspective. like if you talk to someone today, but havent read your friends page in a few days...you can see their hopes, dreams, joys, sorrows, etc. from a little while ago, already knowing how things have played out. 

its kinda interesting. 
some people are very secretive in person, but let a lot of shit loose online. weird."

"event","i woke up hungover today around noon. that was pretty much a mistake. i should have gotten up when i first opened my eyes. cuz when i lay in bed too long i get a headache anyways. i slept like 11 hours. and i have to go to work soon and feel even worse. 

i have resolution-type things going on, that i might follow through with. its not new years, but so what if i get to shit 7 months late, right?

i was thinking about establishing some credit, cuz im starting to get too old to just work with cash anymore. im not really sure about the best way to go about it, but we'll see what happens. all i know is that saving my money little by little isnt enough anymore. sometimes matters are far too urgent to wait like that. i just gotta get in the habit of replacing the money i use. 

im gonna stop denying the good people who want into my life. they've already proven their worth, i just need to stop being stupid. 

and once again its time to make another attempt at kicking ""the habit"". most people dont believe my desire to be free of that shit, and i dont blame them...just gonna keep on trying, cuz the desire alone is sometimes enough to make me feel better about myself. 

and the rain seriously needs to fuck off. 
its been weeks now, and im done with this shit. 
i really cant remember a summer that's had this many consecutive rainy days. 
one good thing about the rain is it drives most of the bugs away. 
so maybe ill live with it."

and there are far too many insects in my life. 
i feel like i cant escape them. 
they're kinda like...around every corner, in my car, my room, work, outside by the porchlight. 
and i honestly feel like they're out to get me."

"event","last night, my family and some close friends took me downtown to larry flint's club to celebrate my bday. i was kinda skeptical at first, i didnt know if i'd have a really good time. but i got mad free drinks, was entertained, and the girls there dont really hassle you a whole lot like they do at other places. all in all it was fun as shit. and my grampie cracks me up. hes goin on 90, but he parties hard. 

and afterwards, my mom, dad, and uncle took me out for even more drinks...and my uncle and i traded drunk stories and my parents were shocked as hell. fun times."

"event","so, monday was my bday...i went and renewed my license, and went to the liquor store immediately after that. the lady didnt card me until i made her. i was like ""today, of all days, i feel the need to show this to you..."" i got some sam adams. its grampie's new favorite lol. then i went to tim kaye's to record some bass lines for tony's songs. one take. im a genius. 

yesterday i was at work, and then my boss asked me to ride along with a driver to make a delivery. that was cool, cuz i got a lot of hours, and didnt have to do hardly anything all night. 

today i got a message from my old band mate steve. he wants to get together and try writing songs again to form a band. im kinda unsure about it, because of the way things went before, but given my current dead-end feeling when it comes to my music, i cant afford to turn it down. he and i did always write well together. i think it might just work, but im gonna be suspicious for a while, naturally."

"event","so last night was tom petty with tony. that shit was really fuckin awesome, definitely one of the best shows ive ever seen. stevie nicks came out for a bunch of songs, and that was a nice suprise. i got to see one of my favorite guitarists, mike campbell, only a few yards away from me, because our seats were damn good. 

this concert put me in a really good mood, and its still goin pretty strong. i hope it lasts for a while, cuz i feel pretty good."

"event","so...i guess everyone's going to sonar tonight. that kinda sucks. i would go, but i've wasted too much time there already, and i just cant think of a good enough reason to get home from work in time to rush out there. i'm pretty much not going there again until after im 21, which is only like 10 days away, so it'll probably be longer. that place sucks, but its like a controlled suckage...if you're really, really in need of something to do on a friday night, it can be pretty good. or if everyone you know is already going. but thats still no guarantee that its gonna be fun. 

tomorrow is tom petty at nissan pavilion w/tony. thats gonna be awesome as hell. im pretty sure this is supposed to be his last major tour, but whatever the case, petty is better than most."

thanks to everyone who asks if im ok when i get all quiet. even though its pretty clear im not gonna talk about any of it, i love ya for the fact that you ask. 

i dont think im gonna drink much for a while...cuz i need to face reality for a minute."

i dont have to go back to work until wednesday, and that makes me pretty fuckin happy. i dont really know whats goin on, but id like to find something to do tonight."

"event","im gonna make another entry about my current state of mind, so if thats not what you're into reading(and i wouldnt blame you) i suggest you pass this over without reading it...

i've always lacked the ability to see the bright side in anything. no matter how hard i look...the glass is always half empty. i used to think that i was just spoiled, and theres no way i had a right to complain about anything, cuz i know theres always someone who has it worse. that looks really good on paper, but the more i think about it, the more i think that the way i see myself is the product of something else, something more elusive and out of my control. cuz i could be sitting at the top of the world, with everything i ever wanted, and id still find a way to put myself down and feel like shit. everything good that happens to me just feels like a consolation prize.  

i dont feel like the world is out to get me...cuz that's just whiny and immature and i hate it when i hear people say that. 

i think that my mind is out to get itself, and the world is just a stage for my failure. 

if i wanted to take an objective look at how my life is progressing, from an outside perspective, id tell myself to lighten up. im just a normal 21 year old guy who hasnt figured out what the rest of my life is gonna look like. and when i tell myself that, it makes a lot of sense and looks pretty good. but i can never feel that good. i can never figure out why i just pace back and forth at work, and almost break down out of nowhere cuz i feel like life is over before it had a chance to begin. 

and that leads me to my next internal struggle, initiative...

i procrasintate like whoa. nothings ever gonna pan out or make a difference, so why try? jobs that i should have taken, that could have gotten me somewhere, just fall by the wayside cuz i cant take the first step. quitting smoking... whats the point? i constantly feel like my days are numbered anyways. i think sometimes that a deadline will force an outcome. personal relationships-never more than 50% of what they could/should have been...because i back pedal. theres only a handfull of people who really know me for who i am...because im scared to let a lot of people in all the way. 

i think that all my negative feelings just keep me from doing anything for myself, cuz for some reason i cant allow myself to be fully happy, or to even take the steps towards it. 

even trying to get help for any of this makes me feel like shit...ive tried it before, the whole ""therapy"" thing...but it was a different set of issues at the time and i didnt wanna let him know everything that was going on. 

i didnt make this list to whine or bitch or anything...or to fish for sympathy, i guess i just did it so i could have something to read to remind myself what im doing wrong. 

if anyone read that whole thing...im sorry for ranting-and taking so long to do it."

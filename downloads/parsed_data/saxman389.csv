"event","I just read this on the internet, BEWARE:

Police officers working with the DARE program has issued this warning: If you are driving after dark and see an on-coming car with no headlights on, DO NOT FLASH YOUR LIGHTS AT THEM! This is a common Bloods gang member ""initiation game"" that goes like this:

The new gang member under initiation drives along with no headlights, and the first car to flash their headlights at him is now his ""target"". He is now required to turn around and chase that car, then shoot and kill every individual in the vehicle in order to complete his initiation requirements.

Police Depts across the nation are being warned that  September 23rd and 24th  
is the ""blood"" initiation weekend. Their intent is to have all the new bloods nationwide drive around on Friday and Saturday nights with their headlights off. In order to be accepted into the gang, they have to shoot and kill all individuals in the first auto that does a courtesy flash to warn them that their lights are off. Make sure you share this information with all the drivers in your family!

Please Forward this message to all your friends and family members to inform them about this initiation ritual. You can save someone's life if you heed to this warning.



I don't know if this is true or not. I'll try to confirm it, but PLEASE be CAREFUL!!!!"

My driving lesson today was...well....a little abnormal.

When you have a car engine heat up to about 250 degrees F during the summer, you have a problem. But the good thing was that I was stuck with a pleasant person whom I actually knew instead of some random driver's ed student.

I'm sure we will always remember the boiling radiator fluid and the 200 degree hood. BTW the person was Liz.

People sleeping, writing, reading, counting shingles, etc. in a concert!!

I love the music but it is just way too long.

The good thing is that after enduring the long torture, Liz and I are on speaking terms again. YAY!!

"event","I heard this joke today during quartet practice. It's pretty good.



President George W. Bush was visiting a school; the teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the discussion on the word ""tragedy.""

So the President asked the class for an example of a ""tragedy.""

One little boy stood up and offered, ""If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs him over and kills him, that would be a tragedy.""

""No,"" said Bush, ""that would be an accident.""

A little girl raised her hand: ""If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.""

""I'm afraid not."" explained the President. ""That's what we would call a great loss.""

The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Bush searched the room. ""Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of tragedy?""

Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand. In a quiet voice he said: ""If an aircraft carrying you, Mr. President, was struck by a ""friendly fire"" missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.""

""Fantastic!"" exclaimed Bush. ""That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?""

""Well,"" says the boy, ""it has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn't be a great loss and it probably wouldn't be an accident either.""


LOL!!"

"event","Finally, the year is over. Now all I have to do is wait for my report card and go to governor's school. I'm really starting to doubt whether or not I want to go to gov school. It seems a tad bit boring from what I am getting in the emails. I don't know. 

I was surfing around the net and found this weird thing:

How to impress your saxophone judge (Only sax geeks will get it)

Wear dark sunglasses, a pastel colored collarless Italian suit, alligator shoes, expensive cologne, and a nice watch. Warm up outside the audition room as the jury is entering by playing Ferling etudes at the indicated tempo using the Caravan articulations. Polish your short shank C* to a high gloss, and have a spare #5 Vandoren ""Hand Select"" exposed in the breast pocket of your suit. Do not play a Keilwerth saxophone or use a Rovner ligature. Speak in a monotone with a vague foreign accent. Request that you be allowed 5 minutes in order that your instrument attains the ambient temperature of the audition room. Following your performance, shake each jurors hand with a firm grip and thank them for their time.

I guess for Liz all she has to do is take off her shoes [LOL!!] and scream at the judge, and then get Mr. Smith to save her butt. [Just Joking!]

I'm really bored! If somebody wants to do something call my cell.

Valete, Omnes."

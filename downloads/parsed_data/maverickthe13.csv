"event","well i'm home again, from a 3 day drill...it was alright, nothing overly amazing, just a lot of humping *carrying* all of my gear thru the woods on a long misson, and bull shitting.  i'm just glad it didn't rain any that would have made it once again, wet and cold, which are conditions for any grunt*infantry* person to hate sleeping in the woods, bc one your wet and cold, two your gear is wet and cold (if you have to wear wet boots or uniforms) and three everyone gets pissy.  or maybe that's just me but then again its cool bc you are normally dry if you wear wet weather gear, and two you get you get to hear other people bitch about how miserable it is.  Again maybe that's just me, but it is funny to hear how bad it is and then realize that its not that bad, and could be much, much worse.  I'm glad to be home and clean, and able to sleep in a bed, more or less.....though i do like sleepin out in the woods, its like camping except now i can do it with a rifle and some good squad members around to bullshit and stuff with during the down time.  Next time i'm gonna take cards so when we stay in barracks or what not i won't just be bored and listening to some messed up stories.  Overall the mission i took part in was  a complete success, and we did our jobs and left the objective, and life went on.  Other than that i came home and showered, saw the family for a bit, and then saw my wonderful and beautiful girlfriend, and them came back to the office and i'm bout  rack out and go to sleep...so that's all i've got to say about my life at this point later days kids.."

"event","I had a reply from an exgirlfriend of mine from like 2-3 yrs ago, saying things that got me thinking and now that i am a year older, finally i think got thru my thick  head.  I don't know what exactly i did to hurt her years ago, other than break up, but i guess that's what happens, when things don't work, but yeah its been a long time since i thought about that.  Anyway..... i think i figured out half the reason i get so mad at myself when i screw up or don't do things i want to do.  i focus soley on the mistake or missed goal/opportunity or whatever until it makes me change my whole view on myself.  I think of myself as being a failure, loser, idiot, etc, and let that be who i am, rather than how i  really know myself, and how others that know or have known me see me.  I loose track of my greater qualities, and uniqueness, and fall to a lower level mentally, and act as if the world is over and nothing ever changes, and make a victim of myself.  I am a great guy and other things that she and many many other people have told me i am.  Its just interesting its taken me about 22 yrs to figure it all out that no matter what i am still the same person, though i've made some stupid and idiotic mistakes, and learned from them, my personality as a whole has never changed or altered in a great way.  So i guess i'm finally back to a comfortable spot in my own skin and nothign is changing that, i am who i am bc that is who i am meant to be and nothing will change that.  I guess now that i've written it out it makes more sense, all i know is i ahve someone i truly do care about and she cares about me, and things go as they go, and long as she see's me as who i am and all that i am mistakes and all and still cares i can't be unhappy.  Anyway today has been way to long, so i'm gonna crash out and chill tomorrow especially after all the moving i had to do in the last week.........later kids, the speech and etc is done....."

"event","I overslept today, not that i didn't need it. Especially after only getting like 2 hrs of sleep from friday night till Sat.  Then doing missions with the unit till almost midnight with the unit during training then waking up at 0500 ( i think) Sunday.  I'm not really sure because i didn't check my watch, i was too busy waking up to the freezing cold, dressing and getting chow.  We didn't get to shoot any damn thing like the training had called for, since the other company's got there first or what not.  Talk about a crock of shit, i wanted to open up and refamiliarize myself with the 240 B, 249 Saw, and other weapons i'm supposed to use.  Its been over 2-3 months since i last fired a weapon, the M16A2- the Vietnam era weapon of the US Army, its about two steps back from what we use now, it is still effective but no fun to carry around if your not gonna use it..even with blanks.  Hopefully next month will be better when we get to do the same type of drills and missions infront of the Col and Sergeant Major.  Other than that i'm just hoping for a job to come thru and me to start working again.  Because lately i've become overly bored and tired of sitting around doing absolutely nothing.  I need to get a job so i can also plan to move out and pay off all of my bills, which seem to be continually mounting.  The only thing seeming to go my way is the fact i have someone in my life who cares, though sometimes i wonder how it will end up.  Its been rough between us before, i just hope it all remains in the past, bc i know that's where i wanna be, i guess its just up to her and what she wants.  
I'm so bored right now i'm just getting cranky, its like i have no life unless i'm working and away from home.  Which annoys the hell out of my folks who think i don't spend enough time at home and being part of a family.  Its hard to prove this when the job i used to have worked me from 5 pm until whenever the next morning.  THe only time iw ould see my family then and be part of it would be when i get home and stay awake while they get ready to go to work and eat breakfast, which they seldom talked or acknowledged my presence unless i walked in the door.  Its harder now that th ings seem to be going wrong for them.  Its just a lot of stress and high emotions, which puts everyone on edge.  I'm just not sure what to do some days, to be quite honest i'm just watching and hoping everything gets fixed or turns out right.  
I guess i'm just sick of being bored and things seem to be weird at times between me and everyone else.  I know life is hard, but its harder when you can't do things to make them go your way.  I can't make someone say they love me, i can't fix the stuff at home, i can't make money if they have to wait to get  it in to start, its like i can't do anything to make it easier on anyone.  I've always felt in my life that i can fix and heal anything, bc that's what my name means, not that i really think its true in theory.  yet i can count or know of peoples lives who i've affected, and helped thru stuff and then i realize how many of them help me carry on and be who i am.  Hell i can think of the nights and times i've tried to kill myself and realize how many peoples lives i'll have affected if i did die.  Its a frightening thought, bc even though i may be at my bottom,there are still people who are around me that don't want me gone.  I guess i live for those people and don't want to dissappoint them.  I guess i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them, that and they are half the reason i don't wanna fail.  When i was at basic i could read their letters and realize how deeply they care and want me to succeed, and when i would tell them of how i was struggling send me motivation and say i could do it, no matter what.  And on Graduation day when i realized what i had made it thru i realized that i did it in part for me and my dreams, and the other part of them.  I guess that's just life as me i live for other people, and for myself in one life.  It may seem confusing though this is life as me...
this is just a rambling ...so yeah...there ya go.."

"event","its like 1 am and i'm sitting here drinking jim bean and dr. pepper, just for the pure fact i can and am.  That and to try and subdue the pain i think i feel over all the stuff i've been through within the last year and a half, and two years roughly with my ex...ain't that a kick in the head.  I've finally decided to walk away from her and wanting to keep persuing a  relationship that wasn't working to begin with, bc no matter what i would try to run from it.  I don't know why, maybe i was scared of commitment, maybe i was afraid i wasnt' good enough, or even i got bored, not sure don't care, its over and i'm sittin here drinkin to forget her, all that stuff that happened, and just to try and not be in my own head.  Guess that didn't work, bc here i am spillin my guts to myself bc noone ever reads this and it gives me something to do and feel guilty about later as i tear myself up over who i am, what i am, what i've done and who i've managed to hurt along the way.  Its a pretty sad life when you manage to do all of that with people you care about, and then try to act as if your still a good person on some level.  I keep hearing how good i am, yet point out with examples and explainations that i'm not a good person or anything resembelign one and yet people still risk being hurt by me, due to that fatal attraction or interest in me they have.  It kills me taht people think highly of me or ""see"" me so much better than i do.  Since i'm ""too hard"" and depreciative of myself, must be the self loathing i possess that allows me to be so dark and morbid as of late.  yeah i do have momments where i shine but even then, its not like its something spectacular.  I hate hurting people, even those who are silly enough to fall in love or find interest in me, a punk ass, dramatic, mental basket case who can't seem to do jack shit right.  I'm not the good guy i appear, i don't know why people say that, i'm evil inside and out, its just something i've never been able to grasp, no matter how hard i try to be a good person i always do something to screw it up. Never living it up inside my head, i never forget, hell the scars i ahve won't let me either, guess i really should have cut deeper and not on my shoulder, stupid second guessing.  Yet even then there's something that keeps me from wanting to die, and i guess that's hope, one day i'll be who i want, true to myself and accepted as such and find the Lie they call love and so on and so forth.  THough i doubt very much it will ever happen, bc frankly yeah i have people interested in persuing a relationship with me i don't feel attractive or necessarily like me when i'm by myself, and i'm okay with that, bc i'm not.  I""m not what people see and it worries me that maybe i am too harsh on myself, maybe i am a great guy who just ""tries to hard"" or just aren't good enough period, i don't know.  Jim Bean and me are on the same level-its good to be wanted but at what price, I've never ever once really understood what attracts people to me, they explain or try to and its just like wow, what the hell are you on bc i want some of that.  I don't see or try to see myself as everyone else does.  I am the uniqueness that i am, i dress my way, carry my own demeanor, and style, though people accuse me of t rying to be who i'm not, when in fact that's who i am, a wonderful, chaotic blend of everything.  I don't know i'm jus trambling most likely but i just am tired of hurting people, especially when they care about me and i for them and it just doesn't work, either in attempts to hook up, hook ups, or day dreams, i'm just a silly little boy, with dreams of granduer, and wishin i saw what other see, one time, and fell in love with me to.  here's to booze and honesty, bc its when its all out there.  ANd i'm sorry to those that i've hurt who read this, maybe i'm just not good enough or okay enough in my head to be with you, you can do better than me, plain and simple truth, and this is part of who i am, the part i try to keep hidden, even if my eyes still scream it out to the world, the whole journal is who i am, unaltered and unchanged, welcome to my life.......i'm just a shadow on the wall........."

"event","I guess all things come back to you in some form or fashion, my heart has returned to me and i'm no longer scared of love or falling into or out of it.  Its been two  years almost that we've been together but as good as it was its over now and i know that inside and out.  Nothing will change that fact i've tried in vain it seems, but i believe it just wasn't meant to happen right now, who knows about the future not me.  But i will admit ever since our conversation last night i finally understand how you can fall in and out of someone and be confused by what your heart and mind want and what you actually need.  I am now in that point but i have a feeling it won't last long i won't let it.  I am a good man with a good heart and a good life ahead of me, all i've got to do is quit looking and stuff and everythign will work out, my feelings are returning to normal and everythign i've blown out of proportion is over i 'm back to being me, and that's all i care to be."

"event","Here i go at 0039 hours, wide awake and waiting for 0330 to come will i will most likely grab all of my gear and travel to Valley, Alabama to meet my unit the 1/167th A Company Mechanized Infantry.  It is my first time meeting and training with my actual unit.  I am a little nervous about making a good impression and upholding my image as a good soldier and trained personnel.  I am there after traveling to Ft. McClellean in Anniston to use one of the ranges to train and bivouac, for the weekend.  What training i will participate in i have no clue as of yet seeing as i have not been briefed nor given and necessary gear.  Not that i don't have any but the unit has not given me any of the gear i need to be issued, or any of my insignia of the unit.  I have never seen or really met anyone from my unit.  I am only familiar with the people i have trained with at Basic and those i attented BTOP with, so i feel as if i am on my own so to speak.  I will give my training my full attention and do it to the best of my ability, yet for some reason or another i still have some doubts lingering in the back of my mind.  I am highly trained, i am somewhat proficient with all of the task i need to know and apply at any given instance, yet i have not used or utilized any of these skill in roughly a month or longer, since there is no real application of them in the ""real world"" other than on a battle field or training event.  I can only hope and assume that i will do well.  I almost wish i had gone active duty so i could be better at what i do and do it better every time i do it.  I am also going to start doing more PT training, and find the motivation within myself and a good friend to keep up a steady regimen.  I can only hope i do not embarrass myself.  OTher than that most of my life is pretty much in order, I am single and enjoying myself to the best of my abilities.  School is the same old crap that i do every other day, with only a few classes keeping my attention and devotion to pursue them more intently.  I have been keeping in contact with friends i often feel i have let fall to the way side, some more than others.  Some of them are the best friends i could ever ask for, others still i feel have a lot of  growing up to do and need to learn to deal with certain issues, like jealousy and how life really goes.  Other than that i am well, i'm going ot work more on quiting smoking and dipping, and take care of myself better when i do finally quit.  It should be an intersting experience to say the least.  Well i guess now is my time to sign off and focus on what i have to do this weekend, i guess just wish me luck and pray for me and my fellow comrades in service whether in the Guard, Reserve or Active Duty where ever they may be stationed, here or abroad.  Hooah."

"event","Its just another night, a long drawn out, restless, sleepless night i spend alone.  After this long you think i would't be bothered by not sleeping and letting my mind wonder aimlessly throught times and spaces, sadly it only makes things worse.  Especially when i think long enough on nothing and open my mouth and say stupid shit, oh well life moves on one step at a time, one day at a time.  I have to quit dwelling, there is no going back, there is no returning, there is no emotion, there is no anything to dwell on, nothing.  It is all over adn done with, there is no her, there is no ya'll, there is no more us, just you and yourself and silence.  I'm doing better than i have in other times we've broken up, no knives, razors or stupid juvenille, destructive habits have crossed my mind, which is a step in a new direction.  I will no longer let anyone get that deep under my skin where i feel i need to go back to a darker side of me, no more will i torment myself into believing i'm what i'm not.  I've moved past all that, and now i'm moving past all this, one step and one day at a time.  I am the man i want to be, i belive at this juncture in time, i am the person i can still look in the mirror and stand to look at everyday, and there is nothing going to change that, anytime soon.  I am going to enjoy my new found freedom, as it was granted to me, and just live like i've got nothing to loose bc sadly i've lost that when it ended.  But for now this has been one long ass night and its still not quite over yet, i'm still awake and its not cool, bc there is jack and shit to do, and i'm bout to loose my damn mind.  So i'm signing off and going to look for some entertainment, later days kiddos."

"event","Well for the second consecutive night i cannot sleep worth a damn, i am wide awake, at 0235 hrs.  I don't know why i'm so awake at night now, its bad enough i really haven't slept that well since coming home, either by not sleeping, sleeping too long or hardly at all.  My head is fubar, i guess, there has to be something goin on mentally that i'm not aware of, i just wish i could figure it out.  ALl i know is i've been having dreams that are really weird and that i cannot seem to escape from, ex, this morning, i woke up to a noise, from in a dream, rolled over concked back out, was in the middle of the same dream then switched to a different one, this happened  another time before i finally got up.  I mean i was trying to get up and stuff but my body would not let me get up and move i was literally knocked the hell out.  I can't explain it, but its like the second time its happened, that i can remember.  

I have been spending a lot of time on myspace catching up and lookin at the profiles of friends i have not spoken to or seen since  graduation.  Two of which were close to me in a sense, we were better friends before jr year or so of HS, but both are actively sworn into Active Duty Army.  To say the least i'm a little bit jealous, bc they kind of have the jobs i want, and live the life i want, of being active duty military.  I'm slowly becoming burnt out from school, i  have no real part time jobs right now, since hte one i have seems to be closing up shop.  And on top of that i haven't done any training or pt in awhile, so i feel like i'm a sharpened tool, that is slowly becoming dull and useless since the skills and task i've learned to master and taken to heart are kind of useless in the civilian world.  THen again there's not much you can do with an infantry job in the civilian world, other than cop work, etc, but hey i could always be a mercenary, but that's not right, but i hear the pay is great, lol.(bad joke, very bad joke).......I wish i would have gone active duty, hell i'd be at my duty station doing my job and training, maybe going ot Airborne or Air Assault school, earning my pay and doing things the Army way.  I guess i'm just unsatisfied a little with how things are going right now.  I am frustrated, confused and annnoyed, that i seem to be getting no where in school, when all i've done 90% of the time is give all i've got to better myself in the educational sense, though it does not seeem to be paying off at all, Im still stuck in a jr college.  The dreams of attending the university i've had my heart set on is slowly dissapating before my eyes, since i cannot seem to grasp the flaws in my studying habits or lack there of sometimes.  I just want to do what i was trained to do and show i am a good soldier and person.  I want to be my own hero, even if i don't fulfill all of my dreams, i'll take a good career over not finishing college.  I know the risks of active duty- being moved around so much, i've done that all my life, a few more years isn't going to kill me.  The threat and danger of being sent to Afghanistan or Iraq, so what some thigns you just gotta man up and do, whether or not you wanna do it, those are those kind of places and times.  I know better guys than me are already over there and ready to come home, deserve to be home and i'm sitting here feeling useless.  Its kind of sad bc i'd do anything to bring my buddy home right now and let him be with his girlfriend and family and friends.  Mine knows what i've decided to do with my life and support it, though i feel  sometimes they can't handle me being in harms way or deployed for a long time.  I've got to become my own man and in some ways i really have, i'm taking life more seriously, and thinking and acting like and adult, i think, even if others see it differently.  

Anyway that's all i've got for right now so later kids, i'm out.."

"event","I'm sittin here drinkin and thinkin at my best friends place and yes i am stealing his computer for all of the time required to emote all this stuff i have in my head, so bear with me.  I've done a lot of soul searching and personal exploration, only to come to the conclusion and realiziations that i trust and care more in what people say and think of my life, and who i am with than i normally care for in normal faire.  I trust peoples opinions and what they say to mean more than what i honestly think and feel in my heart and mind, even if things to bother me i tend 99.9% of the time to figure them out for myself or get to a state where i can deal with it on my own without assistance.  I have some how forgotten alot about myself and who i am in recent times, letting myself somehow morph into a person i rarely recognize anymore other than a person who is drinking when the mood strikes, even if it is only one or two, other than the weekends, and the fact i'm drinking a little harder on the weekeneds bothers me slightly since i feel like i am drinking to kill the guilt and regret i feel for doing stuff i know only hurts me or someone else who is still a  very important person in my life.  I feel like not only have i hurt her but pushed her to her limits with my immaturity, because i sometimes can't figure out what i want most, or where exactly i'm trying to lead my life and then listen to closely to what people think i should or shouldn't do or who with.  I am stupid like that, i don't know why that has happened in the last 3-4 years, especially since i've spent almost 2 wonderful, fantastic, and rewarding years with a woman who has always supported me and been behind me no matter what i've managed to do or screw up, we somehow worked through it and became a stronger couple and stronger people together.  I know my friends often say i can do better than her, for reasons i don't really know or understand sometimes, but i failed to realize more often then not where my heart lies and why it lies there.  I cannot explain how or why i do certain things other than the fact that is just part of who i am, and what i feel like doing at that momment, whether it be from being the crazy, funny semi-drunk guy at a party to the deeply caring and loving person only few people have seen me be to the wildly mad and emotionally unstable person and state i can achieve when i'm pissed off enough, which i think is quite rare.  I guess what i'm really trying to say is i overly miss what i had and wish some nights when i'm all alone crawling into bed, staring at my ceiling, that i still had, though i know i  still feel that i'm not worth her time, and that she can do better than me just because i'm not used to having someone care and want me regardless of everything for who i am on the inside.  For some God forsaken reason that's one demon i have not been able to shake in 21 years, i can't explain it, maybe it has something to do with the fact i always felt rejected by my biological dad for walking out on me when i was younger and that i was never good enough for him to care about me, and then always feeling like no matter what i did right or wrong in my mothers eyes, i would never really amount to much of anything at all, especialy when if i would fail or try to give on something i would be compared to him and be told i would end up just like him.  I guess that's more of the reason i try so hard to do my best at everything, and excel to prove to her and myself that i am better than a guy who never really grew  up or made anything of himself.  Even if i haven't done really much of that myself i do give myself credit for graduating HS, making Eagle scout-go ahead laugh, its not as easy as it sounds if you don't have some drive to get there, hell less than 1% of all Boy scouts ever make it, i'm the elite if you want to get technical, and then i've been goign to college for the last almost 3 years, tryign to earn a degree and graduate and on top of all that shit, i've made it through US Army Basic for Infantry, that really takes heart, pride, and manning up, to over come fear, your doubts, insecurities, and the fact almost half the people i know even if they haven't admitted it, thought i would fail, and the other side of that is the d rill sergeants would say i would, well F*#k ya'll i made it and all on my own, and with some help and encouragement from my friends at basic and at home, i love ya'll more than i show sometimes but i'm always around whenever ya need me.  Most of all i guess all this thinking has made me realize i am happy with myself the way i am, even if i have doubted it for who knows what reasons, i think i gave into to what people said more than i gave into what i truly felt, and i guess i'm just sorry i hurt her, and wasn't man enough i guess to stick to her side and show her how much i care and by God still care for her, even if i do my damndest not to let her see how much i still do, even if it kills me silently when i'm by myself.  I miss her alot, and wish i was still with her, bc i do know how much i mean to her and i just wish somehow someway i could show her i'm ready to have what we've already had, and not walk away from it anymore and not listen to those i thought were my friends but i guess have their own agendas, i'm not around them like i used to be and that's the best i can manage right now.  Yeah i have half heartedly enjoyed being single in the time we've been apart and yeah i've done some stuff uncharacteristic of myself, but i guess that's just my sad, sad, sad attempt to hide the pain and hurt from myself by doing stuff and things i wouldn't ever do under other circumstances, i guess i can be a sad and idiotic bastard, sometimes, but i also realize i've also been through so much crap in my life and made mistakes, that i will whole heartedly take the blame for and i've learned my lessons and i know who i am on the inside, and that's what really matters.  I just wish i could make her as happy as she made me, and show her who much i've changed for the better even in my just my mental aspect, and how i think i'm ready to start over again with her and tell everyone else to f*#kin kiss my skinny, pale, scrawny white punk/country ass.  I'm willing to risk just about anything, mostly everything i've got- my name, my reputation, my heart and soul on the line for one last final chance to make things right, yet sadly i feel as if that chance will never come, i'm afraid to talk to this woman for fear of it already being to late or the fact she won't take me back regardless, bc  i seem to dick around with her emotions, yet i know she knows i kill myself more by thinking about it constantly bc i dwell way to much on stupid shit, though i'm changing that from now on.  I just want her, bc 1) i know who i am, 2) I know her inside and outside, 3) i know i'm happy somewhat without her 4) i'm even mor happy wi th her, and 5) she makes me feel good especially when i have a relationship with her, and i can't turn my back on her, even after everthing we've been through together, and that she means just that damn much to me..it kinda hurts me to just be withouth her and wonder what she's doing.  Babe, if you ever read this which i feel and think you just still may i want you to know i'm sorry, and i want to talk to you but like i said earlier i'm kinda scared, bc i've pushed you away so much, but know things have changed and i just want you, and everyone can hold their tongue or just leave me the hell alone bc i was happy where i was until i started listening to them, and that's where i screwed up.  I miss you and love you still, and if its to late by now to say this then i'm sorry for wastin  your time trying to hold you back, i'll always be around if you ever want to talk, or need someone to listen to you, i'll be that guy.    I love you and hope you forgive me and maybe we can work something out, you know how to reach me, i'll be around--------


anyway just some thoughts i've had for the last little while and well alcohol brings out the best in ya, lol, so here ya go...later days kiddo's i'm headin off the net for awhile, gnite and peace out Atown down..."

"event","well it looks like i've shot myself in the foot or face which ever is more painful.  I've left my gf yet again for reasons that i understand when i want to.  I've had a mostly sleepless night, another one in the last 3 weeks since i've been home.  I'm hurting myself, not sleeping well and then tearing myself up with all the constant thinking and emoting i've done trying to figure my life and myself out, i am one confusing and mentally twisted ass bastard.  I know she probably hates me now since it seems like i was toying with her emotions.  I wasn't trying to but unfortunately that's the way it seems i am, able to hurt the ones i care about the most easier, not matter how hard i try not to.  Yet i always seem to hurt myself more just because of the plain fact i care way more for other people and their feelings that I often but myself second or not at all, to somehow protect them from the pain i most likely cause them, thought it often doesn't work.  I hate myself more and more as the days wear on, i'm not the same person i was back in high school.  I've seemed to have lost the simple innocence i've once possessed, i've lost my straight forward attitude and lack of feeling towards peoples opinions and dumbass comments.  I""ve given in to fitting in and conforming to the social scene and trying to be a part of something that i really don't have to fit into.  I've seemed to have i think lost some of my uniqueness and qualities taht i guess endered me to my friends and associates..yet i do still possess some endering qualities or what not that still attract people to me, even thought i really don't understand any of them or why they feel the way they do towards me.  All i know is i'm alone in my own head right now and i kinda need it to find out what makes me really trully happy, and therefore maybe one day after i've gotten over the best person in my life i can realize that i lost her and should have stayed, but for now i walk this lonely road and live my life my way, maybe hopin to still be myself as i've evolved over the last 3-4 years, to be the man i am and the man i know i can be.  But I hate myself right now for hurting her and i hope one day she'll forgive me and we can still be friends, and so i guess all i can say is f@%K me in my head......one day and n ight at a time.  later kiddos i'm out for now....."

It is sad news to hear and harder still to try and explain but i'm well and the situation is over you could say.  I'm sorry it happened and i should have been a little smarter but lessons learned again and feelings are gone, but i'm still me.  All things are getting better in all aspects of life, i'm back with who i belong with, we worked things out and i realized alot about myself in the time i was with out her, and i some of what i realized is that i loved being with her, and i only focused my attention on the negative things that happened last summer, most of which were things i did personally, and things in which i will never do again.  I am a good guy  and will continue to be, i have learned myself backwards and forwards, i just have to keep up my strength and move forward bc there is no going back to a past with my ex that i had problems with, and my gf now is the most wonderful thing in my life and i will  hold on to her until she doesn't want me any more.  Anyway, i'm outta here for now, and life will continue to go forward.  Much love ya'll i am me and i am happy where i am at, and who i am with, that's the only thing i really need to focus my attention on."

"event","Best way i could think to put the subject, so yeah deal, I""m sitting here at the office smokin, thinking, trying to get out of my seemingly daily funk, i don't know what it is really.  ALl i know is i feel a little off, a little bored, a little lonely, a little crazy, and a lot of time remembering and reflecting.  I've been single now for a week, a week that has had its ups and downs, most of it thinking hard about what i want, or who, or whatever the hell i'm doing.  i don't hate her but i've definitely been putting up a wall or feeding into my defensive mechanism, and dealing with it like i would deal with things at basic.  Just not give a rats ass and not feel or think just do, and i do just go through the motions of the day not really a part of reality or life just another obedient creature in a foced habit.  I guess that's how it is.....i dunno i've always been under the impression i strive off the beaten path and walk my own and do my own unique thing.  For the most part i have and will for as long as i'm alive, which as its seems will be for quite a while.  All i know is i'm still caught up doing the same mental things i always do, over analyzing and thinking way to much about stuff i'm pretty much better off letting alone.  *sorry had to get a beer* and yes i'm drinking at 945 am before class, while at work.  its really interesting..anyway...
I love my ex to death i will for i'd assume until i'm either completely over her or just forget her, but that's hard to do with someone you've been off and on with for 2 years or roughly there about.  All the memories, trials and tribulations, and especially those special momments only the two of us could share.  The nights we'd lay in bed at my apt when i had it, and kiss, and hold one another close and listen to the radio, cds, sing along, and just watch the candles burn, carrying on conversations or enjoying a comfortable silence just being close to one another.  I miss that, we haven't done anythign that simple in a long ass time, and its something i like, yeah call me a sissy if you want, i don't care, after going thru basic and being away from her for so long you look forward to stuff like that, bc its the small things in life that mean the most and are missed the most when they are gone.  I miss her and i know she misses me but things will never be the same.  Yeah i'm still the same guy i was when i left for basic but now being back home and spending all those nights alone, and thinking i realized a lot of stuff and honesty i guess sets you free, even if it kills you inside when your all alone and all you can think of is the past you held on so dearly bc it was all that you knew.  Now its time to know me for me, and quit doubting myself and second guessing who i am and all the good things about me, so i can move on to what ever the future holds for me.  
Yeah i've met some people and what not but i'm just lost i guess in my own mind, hoping for the best and stuff that isn't felt or whatever, yeah that's odd i've got to move forward and leave my pain behind because if i don' its all i will know and i won't be happy either way.  SO i gotta put my best foot forward, smile at the world and live my life, as it comes, the way i want, and espeically for me bc i've only got one life to live so i gotta make the most of it.  Bc who knows if and when i may get called up to go to MS,LA, or over seas, i look forward to the latter bc i get to actually do what i was trained to do and do my job with the Army, and yes i love the career path i've choosen, its really kick ass and its a promising future.  Anyway, i just gotta see where my heart and mind lead me beyond all that stuff, my past and open the door to the future and just enjoy being me and see what happens, its the best thing i can do for myself.  I'm not hanging on to anything or anyone so look out world a new ""bad boy"" personality is hitting the area, lol, so watch out for my alter ego Maverick McSpanky.  And yeah that is my full nickname and yeah its just funny, i'm still the same person but i do a lot more stuff that's crazy or what not, so be entertained and if you don't like it bite me.....literally....women only...hehehe, bad joke, bad joke.  anyway enough musing and thinking its time to sit back and enjoy.  Later days..."

I've just really got to move on from all this bullshit and find my own direction, and do waht i'm doing to make myself happy, though i can't say i'm truly happy anymore.  I'm sittin here drinking a beer, bc i want to crawl inside and let the world pass me by and hope my heart ache goes away eventually, that way i can't hurt and i can't see you move on, and see the things in you that made me happy, and saw the looks in your eyes that always spoke to me, I""m just sorry i'm not the man who deserves you, I'm doing this to move on, i'm doing this to finish trying to solve the problems, i'm doing this to cure my heart, I'm doing this bc i don't know what else to do, I'm doing this to leave the bs from everyone behind me, half the people giving me shit are your friends, what the hell should i care what they think, they have no fuckin clue to what i've said to you in the past 3 weeks, they don't know the blood i've shed, they don't know the tears i've cried, they sure as hell don't know the pain i feel, they don't know the truth, about you and I, and that we both screwed up and miscommunicated, whether i thought right or wrong, I just wanna g et past you and somehow no matter how far away you are i still feel you somewhere closer, and it never lets me forget, at all everythign we did, from teh first night i kissed you inthe cold, to when i sat and talked to you on the steps of the laundromat and then dragged you out in the rain to kiss me, as it pelted us and ran off the sides of your cheecks, and off the bill of my hat,  or the night you spent the night in my bed and i asked you out and you said yes, the nights on the porch just you and me, the phone calls that would last for hours and hours until the wee hours of the morning bc one of us couldn't sleep, and had to hear the others voice.  I can't leave all those memories and the fact 13 months is what i had with you in the past,i just can't let it go, no matter how hard i try, and yeah i know i'm repeating myself like there is no tomorrow, but this is waht i think of everyday, everything-every mistake, every surprise look and sweet thing i did for you, all of it from day one to day 395, every smile, every kiss, every hug, every look, every thought, i just can't put them away and never remincse, not even the bottle in my hand lets me forget, and it kills me sip by sip, memory by memory, day by lonely day, and i don't know what to do, all i know is i'm done studying and your all that fills my mind right now, maybe more beer will help, later ........................"

I just wanna be free of you,
To be free of all the mistakes I've made.
I just need you to let go of me and all of our memories together
The pain will fade like an old photograph in your mind.
It will be over once you let go of it Like i'm forced to do.



I just wanna roll over and die tonight
I can't stand another fight like this
My heart can't take this kind of pain anymore,
ALl your doing is hurting both of us over and over again
You can't feel the pain I have inside
since it make me wanna go back to the way I was
Living by the Blade.


One shot to remember, just to reminesce about everything
Once shot to numb all of the pain, so it doesn't hurt so much
The rest, are just to forget everything and move forward and leave 
everythingabout you in the void, and misplacing the contents of my heart some
where I'll never find it
Here's to love you and forgetting you all in the same night,
heres to leaving it all somewhere I don't want ot revisit again.
Here's to being who I am, with all of my flaws and mistakes
and learning from them, one day at a time.
So one shot to remember, just to reminesce about everything
One shot to numb it all away, and many more to forget it all again."

Yeah today was one of those day, yet i haven't been in bed, as much as i have been sitting in front of this monitor and lounging on the couch. I""ve watched tv and movies, and listened to the radio all day, its kind of a boring ass day, compared to last night and this morning.  I met a kid that was still in HS that could play the hell out of the guitar and wrote some amazing songs, plus i made one of the greatest jokes, by accident, which made it even better.  Story behind it being, he was playin and said ya'll come up with some words, so i though and i came up with this, I was sittin  here at the bar, drinkin with Jim and Evan, but i finished my Jack off yesterday.  Stupid undoubtibly but funny as hell when you've been drinking, i've never heard so many people laugh at somethign so stupid. but it just happened, it was cool i felt cool for all of 30 seconds, but yeah I played guitar for a min and we listened to some more songs.  I hope that kid gets famous, he's really talented and has a great songs, and a head on his shoulders that will take him places.  But yeah its just been an overly relaxing day at home, just trying to finish getting all of my thoughts out of my head, and not look at what i've done to myself, but oh well i'll soon forget about it all.  ANyway, i'm just putting this up here bc i've got nothin else to be doing right now, so its all good, Later Kids"

"event","The feel of a steel cold blade across pale, dry skin 
A sudden release
As the beginning of a slow, steady flowing stream of 
A crimson river begins,
Ebbing and crashing down the worn shell of existence
A smile that can only come from a known pleasure
No mention of pain, no tears of sorrow
Only the full rapture of a joy unknown
The rivers current carries it all away
Swiftly, silently to a desolate oasis
Letting it pool and drown all visions and thoughts 
Of a simple reality
Leaving the opening for true escape
In that of who releases
Never to be tamed by the hands or the will 
Of those trapped within their own misery
Free to escape everything
Without a whispered word of warning 
To give in to all that is life
And let it drip away 
From your fingertips
No longer confined by restriction

something i wrote years ago, but found and thought needed to be reexamined, so here's to the best, right...so let me know what ya think, later kids"

The two of us, her dad and sister went hunting on their land, and didn't really see anything and by anything i mean..absolutely nothing! It kinda sucked but oh well life is like that it just gives me reason to go back next season and try again, bc I really enjoyed it and being the hick i think i am at heart.  Anyway get home at 1015, when i said i'd be home, and the nagging begins, i get fussed at for not making enough money, not being able to pay some bills, my need to get a part time job, why i did stuff, why i spent this money, why i don't need to be a bartender, why i don't need to drink on my 21st why i don't need to get drunk, how i run my mouth about doing stuff, like my tattoo and my dyed hair, and my earring, and stuff like that.  Talk about being welcomed home after being gone for 2 days, geez, give me a break.  I don't know what i do or don't do exactly that gets them all over me, its frustating to say the least, I do everything they ask of me most of the time and more.  They hover over me like i'm the horrible child or something, and i'm not that would be my sis who gets whatever she wants, whenever, bc she is the only girl and spoiled rotten.  They tell me i don't need to drink bc of my ""highly"" addictive genetics on both sides of the families, *sigh* nice reminder to tell me how i can be like someone i hate, to which i replied, thanks for knowing me for who i am you guys, and busting me for hypothetical stuff and telling htem stuff about my sis i can't prove, and have them ask her and have her be more than eager to prove her innocence*sigh* i don't get it but oh well.

Something always happens, and the stress builds up and tempers flare adn if you walk in unaware you j ust lit the match on the powder kep of explosives,and its not pretty.

I don't know what to say about it other than i got up at 7 after 3 and NOTE only 3 hours of sleep, to take my ""wonderful"" sister to school, fun times, anyway go home get 30 more mins of sleep get up get ready and go to take the ASVAB, or Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery, in other words the smart test to get into military service, Minimum score to enter, 31, for everything except Air Force, 41, i think, anyway went it there and took it from roughly 10 am to 1 pm. yeah talk about fun, but yeah i get my results, top 20%, with a 75, yes in other words i am able to do just about anything i want in any division or speciality Unit of the United States Army, Huah. word.  Happy no doubt, i have waited for news like this for a long while, bc i have been thinking of joining some form of the Army, right now its going to be the National Guard.  Just to be able to go to school and stay somewhere close to home, and not have to travel an hour or what not to go to drill or work.  But any way...i don't know what else to say that the day got worse and i am out of the house, for good it seems, i am officially independt for the 4-5 time in the year, so yeah i don't know what else  to say except, i have a day i just wanna forget, maybe i'll find the inner strength to go on, and become a better man, or maybe i'll fail and crawl into a bottle, and just pass out there, the night is young and its too early to tell, but wish me luck either way.  I'll probably end up needing it, War Eagle and God Bless, and a happy holiday to all...

But yeah the rest of my life seems to be falling into place, i have a great girlfriend, i have a decent home life,*it really really depends on the day* and i still hate my job at wal-mart, if i rant about hating a place, that would have to most definitely have to be it.  If you can keep all sanity in wal-mart after being there for 8 hrs, let me know i'd like to shake your hand and ask how in the hell you manage it, since for me i can't stand it from the time i walk into work till the time i leave.  Its unbeliveable how crazy the whole damn place is.

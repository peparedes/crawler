Job is fun. I like the people there, they're very lovely and so much better than my previous bosses.. Erk. 

What else?&nbsp;I really want most of the prints in my (!!!!) shop. That said, I have no money whatsoever, but will soon.&nbsp;Yay. Those prints are quite expensive.&nbsp;But they're awesome.&nbsp;They've also got great stories behind them all. Amazing stories. Ken Duncan is quite an extraordinary man. Born again Christian, but still cool. He also shares my love of Peking Duck! YAY! Can't wait to meet him in&nbsp;November. He lives in NSW. Comes down to Melbourne ONCE a year for a weekend. Also takes his Gallery Staff out to dinner when he's down. ROCK AND ROLL!&nbsp; 

Tafe is a bit ok. Monotonous. But ok. Still ned to catch up on stuff I missed when I had Glandular though. Really can't be bothered.. I like signing though. Especially at parties when music's up too loud. It's a great thing to have. Try teaching my father, but he just makes a mockery out of it. Pfft. 

Life is alright. Depite parents sometimes annoying me, health seems a bit meh,&nbsp;need money, need clothes, random things giving me the irits.. Like this: A question for you guys reading this - Don't you hate it when stupid people are walking in front of you, and then suddenly stop?! I feckin hate that! That's my annoyance for this month. Bastards. So annoying. It usually happens at train stations, shopping centres, streets.. Grr. 

*ahem* So, there you go.&nbsp;Dan's 21st last saturaday night was fantastic. Was @ Felix Bar in Fitzroy St. Lots of people, lots of signing, champagne, fun times. I got some bargain clothes while I was in St Kilda too. Vintage clothes shop in Acland St, velvety jackety thing = $10. See! BARGAIN! Also got a $10 jumper from JayJays. Purple and Silver and stripey. Rock.&nbsp; 

Hmm, short journal post today. Strange. Peace out. 

Maddie. xoxo

"event","It's been a while. I've been doin so many things my brain's almost exploded. Don't worry though, it's hasn't.<br /><br />I had my cousin Penny's wedding yesterday. It was beautiful! She looked so lovely, in her cream coloured, lacey, floor length Colette Dinnigan dress. RAWR! If i could be bothered and had a nice computer, I'd load some pics up. Maybe later. Or pester me and I'll show you them when I see you. It was such an awesome day. She got married at St Pauls Cathedral, the bells were rung (cost them $100 for the bells),&nbsp;couldn't've asked for a more gorgeous sunny day, and fecking pain in the arse pointy shoes I had to wear. Fothermuckers if&nbsp;you ask me. I smiled though the pain though. Ha. I had my hair coloured with coppery and blondey foils, and&nbsp;wore a brown cammy, bronze tafata shirt with a sort of frilled-neck lizard collar, and a chocolate brown skirt, which was&nbsp;longer at the back than the front, with velvet stripes goin down the back. It&nbsp;rocked. Shoes - sort of beige coloured with pointy toes and lots&nbsp;of ouchieness. Ah well. S'all good. Reception was&nbsp;at The Willows in St Kilda road, food was good, I had Salmon for entree, chicken for main and lemon tart for dessert. Mmmmm.... lemon taaaaaaart.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yesterday was also my 2nd cousin Amelie's Christening. She is so cute. She's the bride and groom's daughter. She's 1 in November, and she's the most cutest thing in the world. She's got&nbsp; beautiful&nbsp;curly jet black hair and is absolutely gorgeous. She was very well behaved too yesterday, and surprised everyone. :-) <br /><br />Saturday was my father's 65th birthday! It was lovely. We went to a nice restaurant in Greythorn.&nbsp;It was a Lebanese&nbsp;place. Dad thought only the three of us, and his friends Ron and Lila were going. WRONG!&nbsp;There were about 20 of his good friends sitting on 2 big tables. He got a huge surprise. It was awesome. :-) He even&nbsp;danced with a belly dancer lady. I have proof and blackmail and at the same time it was oh, so humilating.. He was an embarrassment,&nbsp;but hey, it was his birthday. So there.<br /><br />Went to Duckdive gig on Friday.&nbsp;That was fun. :-) Got the CD for half price,&nbsp;coz I've taken pix for&nbsp;them. D'aawww. :-) Yay. I love the album, it's so cool.&nbsp;(see subject line for a Duckdive lyric.)<br /><br />And to other more important news... I HAVE A JOB NOW! YIPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!<br /><br />I'm working at the Ken Duncan Gallery in Southgate. On the 3rd level of the shopping precinct. Rock and Roll. I'm so happy. I've wanted a job in photography for so long. It's basically the shop where Aussie Photographer Ken Duncan sells his prints, in calendar form, mounted framed hang on the wall form, puzzle form, coaster and table mat form... they're beautiful landscapes of country, sea, rainforest, city... you have to see them to believe them. :-D(<a href=""http://www.kenduncan.com"">www.kenduncan.com</a>) Take that. My first plug for the shop/site. He has one gallery here and one in Sydney.&nbsp;So yeah.&nbsp;Yay.<br /><br />As some of you may know, and I feel a bit weird to say it, but Ben and I broke up recently. Life is shit sometimes, but I just felt as though it had to be done. I think that I've changed a bit, and just needed time to myself to concentrate on work, tafe and just life in general, and also to have a bit of space. Sorry, Ben, if you're reading this, I hope you've accepted the fact that I believe I did the right thing for me. I hope we can still be friends. Believe me, it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I value your friendship very much, and I'm sure we'll see each other around, I think we just have to get used to it. I can't believe it got out so fast. Everytime I talk to someone, they bizarrely bring up the topic.. and it still makes me shed a tear, even though I try and be strong. Sorry to bring down the mood. I've felt a bit depressed, and sometimes don't want to talk about it at all. Thankyou to my friends and family who have given me support, I really appreciate it.&nbsp;"

"event","<p align=""center"">It's been a while since i last posted. Hopefully this won't be at all boring. <font color=""#800080"">^_^</font><br /><br />What have I been doing? Let's see... I've been recovering from that glandular fever. I feel ok, and my white blood cell count's back down to normal. Yay. Liver and Spleen are functioning properly. I've been able to drink. Yay. It rocks.<br />Still tired though. As always.&nbsp;Hope it's not Chronic Fatigue! <br /><br />Went back to tafe on the 16th. Wooo. Joy. *checks phone for interesting calendar happenings*<br /><br />More holiday stuff... On the 3rd of July, went to <em>my cousin Katie's exhibition</em>&nbsp;at <em>117 Little Lonsdale Street</em>, it was great! She does ceramics, and made little budgies and&nbsp;army planes with&nbsp;little soldier men,&nbsp;and hung it from the ceiling. I suggest you check it out, if you're into that kind of thing. <em>It finishes on the 31st July</em>, so be quick! It's just off exhibition street..&nbsp;:-)<br /><br />On the 6th of July went to Katie's 21st. (not my cousin, a friend Katie) that was fun! Her cakey cake was a star.. meaning it was star-shaped, and no it didn't take the dancefloor and do the moonwalk, although that would have been impressive and a very funky cake. :-) We (excluding the cake) did the Nutbush, Macarena and just danced to random 80s and today music.. Yay.<br /><br />On the 10th of July, my health care card expired. BUT it's ok, people, I got another one. YAY! *does the hurray for HHC dance*<br /><br />On the 12th of July, went to MBG's Peppermint Superfrog Gig at the East Brunswick Club. That rocked. A lot. I used Chris' <font color=""#339966"">spifftastical&nbsp;</font>camera to take some pics, and apparently they came out pretty well. Yay. Ta Chris! His camera was way cool. T'was also a very enjoyable gig.&nbsp;<strong>*Another gig&nbsp;happening soon.</strong><br /><br />On the 21st (last Sat) went to Michelle and&nbsp;Brendan's 21st! It was great! I had my hair all done up and pretty-looking, and glittery-ness shining everywhere. It was very cool. &nbsp;Wore my pretty [black and white Year 12&nbsp;Formal]&nbsp;bodice. <strike>if i could transfer pics from my phone to this page, I'd show you, but I'm not that smart and this computer is really old and crap and I have no enhancements for my phone to connect to such technology, so there you go.</strike> <br />Was an awesome night, anyway. Woo.<br />Brendan got dressed up (by his cousins) as <font color=""#800000""><font color=""#ff0000"">Harry Potter</font>.</font> Was&nbsp;a clever, lame, but entertaining event.<br /><br />On the 23rd, during the day, I wandered round the city, and saw Scotty (GutterMonkey) at Melbourne Central. Just out of the blue. He approached me and said, ""Hey, how ya goin?"" I said, ""good, thanks!"" Then he said, ""Alright.. Let's go!!"" ""Uhhh... Where to?"" GM had a rehearsal to go to, and maybe thought I was someone involved in it (?).. I was in complete and utter confusion. It was hilarious. Then we laughed about it later that night, at&nbsp;Local Laughs Comedy @ The Laundry in Johnston St, which was fantastic. Andy McClelland MCing, Courteney Hocking, Anyone For Tennis, Luke Ryan, Other people I don't know but enjoyed..&nbsp;we made a folk song with Andy. It was fun. He played the song 'Frisbee' and asked who it was by. I was the only one who shouted out <u>""THE LUCKSMITHS!!!""</u> and said, ""Yes, it is The Lucksmiths!"" and I was extremely chuffed with myself, having had a bottle of Strongbows which&nbsp;I drank considerably fast... I was all&nbsp;bouncy. Huzzah.. *sigh*<br /><br />[Also on Monday I was walking down&nbsp;a city&nbsp;street and saw a pile of crates ( .. the wooden things you put boxes&nbsp;on, and lift them up with a forklift..) and its serial number was <strong><u>'POO1661'</u></strong>&nbsp;. I laughed. To myself. It was great. I have photo evidence.. ^_^ ] <br /><br />.................................................................................................................................................................................... it said POO!<br /><br />I'm sorry if I'm boring you. I like to type.&nbsp;A bit. <br /><br />Today, met up with my mate from primary school, Adrienne. Haven't seen her for aaaaagggggggeeeesss. Was nice to&nbsp;catch up with her. :-)<br /><br /><strong>TOMORROW&nbsp;-- <font color=""#00ff00"">*MBG</font> @ <font color=""#ff00ff"">RUBY'S LOUNGE</font>... <font color=""#00ff00"">$8 @ the door</font>.

Hope we get good seats/ANY seats.&nbsp;*crosses fingers* May also&nbsp;rock up to&nbsp;Middo's drinky night in Hardware Lane afterwards. If there's people&nbsp;still there.

Will most likely go to both. :-) YAY! <br /><br />So there you go. If there's something you wanna do this week, there's plenty of gigs, exhibitions, and parties that some of you are invited to&nbsp;and other stuff in there. Hurray! Haha.<br /><br />And no, I haven't bought the new Harry Potter book yet. Shame on me. I have, however seen OotP last Friday. Was awesome. Annoyed they missed out so much info from the book, but, what can you do, they'd have to squish everything else in, therfore making it&nbsp;5 hours in total.&nbsp;Oh well. In the middle of OotP atm. Then must read HP&amp;tHBP.<br />HP geeks will understand that. I'm certain of it. <br /><br />""Why are there hoof marks on the ceiling?!"" <br />""Spider pig, spider pig, does whatver a spider pig does....""<br /><br />HAHAHAHAHA I love it.<br /><br />p.s - making one's post pretty and colourful is very enjoyable indeed. I just hope it works this time. </p>"

"event","<p>I had the best weekend! :-D YEAAAAAAAAH!<br /><br />It was so much fun. I've just come back from a roadtrip to Geelong and Warrnambool, for MBG's Peppermint Superfrog Tour. It was great. Went with Becs, Steve, Robyn, Sarah, and of course the boys. Yay. I so wanna do it again. Got some good pics too. When I have decent interenet access i might put them on flickr... perhaps..<br /><br />Some exciting things that happened:<br /><br />-A few of us got befriended by 4 drunk/stoned people on the Friday night at The Nash, Sparky had a in depth conversation with the stoned guy. The question guy! He was annoying. But he really liked Sparky. <br />-Ate Nash noodles from the noodle bar - YUMMO!<br />-Stayed at The Nash that night.. felt like we were on school camp.. backpackers accommodation.. bunkbeds and shared bathroom/toilet for the whole floor. Yay.<br />-Had to moved Chris' car from a 15 minute zone, as he was&nbsp;a drunken sailor-ish. Apart from the obvious factors, like the sailor suit, the wooden leg, the eyepatch and the parrot. I don't think he had them.. I don't know. No one knows. I'm getting confused between pirates and sailors. Uh oh, I'm in for it now....<br />-MBG covered the 'The-roof, the-roof, the-roof-is-on-fire, we-don't-need-no-water-let-the-mother-f*****-burn' Song which rocked everyone's socks off. :-D<br />-Went to bed at 3.30am that&nbsp;morning. Bad idea. Very tired the next day.&nbsp;<br />-I ordered a <u>'Mars Bar</u> Hot Chocolate' with.. wait for it.. <strong>skinny milk</strong>. Think about it. SEE! Tired. Wasn't thinking. Everyone laughed at me. So did I. Dah. <br />-Drove to Warrnambool. I didn't personally, that was Steve's job. The driving. I tried to sleep. Becs knitted.&nbsp;The trip there took about 2 hours. *yawn*<br />- Saw cows. ZAHWEEEE! Moo.<br />- Watched Dylan Moran DVD at Mick's Place on the Saturday. Had a shower in the process. Well, I wasn't watching the dvd then... I had a shower *while* the others were watching.. THE DVD. Not me. You understand, don't you? I hope so. *glares*<br />-Played a fantastic game. Go to Man Bites God's LJ. Go on, it's so worth it. ^_^&nbsp;<br />- Gig on Sat was cool. Pity about the Criterion Hotel, it's a bit of a hole. Heritage site. Council won't demolish it. People who own it want to demolish it and start again. The boys slept there. Sucks to be you, boys! I have pix of the rooms. Crap rooms, to be honest.<br />-Saw the Dirty Angel.&nbsp;(HAHAHAHA! DIRTY! HAHAHA! ANGEL!)<br />- Went to Thunderbolt Point (?). Beautiful Lookout over the Ocean. Saw whales! Took photos. Was bloody cold.<br />- Played the 'HAY!' game with Becs. Becs won. I lost.<br />- Stopped for KFC for a late lunch on the Sunday. Becs and I both got twisters. Mixed them&nbsp;up. D'oh. Still good though. Mmm.. ccheeeeeken! <br />-Drove back to Melbourne. Dropped Becs off. Steve dropped me home. I got locked out of my own house. Key wouldn't open front door. Someone had snibbed it from the inside. Parents were out. So, called them, said I can't get in. So me and steve went to Balsmic, Eastland, for coffee, waited for the parents to get home so they could let me in. That worked. Yay.<br />-While at Balsamic, saw ex-Tintern people. Yay. Was nice to catch up with them! Jodi, Jessie, Steph, Ness, Eliza.<br /><br />The End. :-)&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh, and this: &nbsp;<strong>MBG - Peppermint Superfrog Album Launch&nbsp;<br /><br />THURSDAY 12TH JULY @ The East Brunswick Club - 280 Lygon St, East Brunswick&nbsp;-&nbsp;w/special guests - Doors - 8.30pm&nbsp;Tickets $12 - at the door.&nbsp;<br /><br />they're also doing this gig...<br /><br />WEDNESDAY 25th JULY - Rubys Lounge - 1648 Burwood Hwy, Belgrave&nbsp;-w/ Duckdive, The Adventure Spirit - <br />Tickets $8 - at the door.<br /></strong><br /><u>THEY'LL ROCK YOUR&nbsp;SOCKS OFF!&nbsp;YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!</u> &nbsp;<br /></p>"

Yay! What have I've been up to, I hear you ask? <br />I slept in til 4pm today. 4pm. Well, slept til about 12, then got up and&nbsp;had some lunch, watched Janet Jackson talk about the SuperBowl incident for the 2nd time, then went upstairs and went back to sleep til 4pm, got up, had a shower, washed hair, found some flowers on the front doorstep from Lauren, then went to Doctor's appointment at 5pm. Went to The Pines with mum. Bought a coffee. Yay! Went home.<br /><br />Well, what other things have I been up to, I hear you ask again? I've mostly getting blood tests, shopping with Mum, goin to the doctor, goin into tafe to see what I've missed, feeling tired, catching up with a few friends, resting, sleeping, watching dvds / movies&nbsp;(Pirates 3, Shrek 3, Napoleon Dynamite, Take The Lead, Finding Nemo, Grosse Point Blank, Brokeback Mountain, Shopgirl, Ross Noble, Thin Blue Line, others that I can't remember the title of.) Glandular Fever is crap. My liver and spleen decided to be hurty last night. It hurts if I laugh.. they say laughter's the best medicine.. what if your insides hurt when you laugh, like my situation? Then that theory is stuffed, ain't it!? Grrrr, says I. <br /><br />That reminds me. This may also interest you Stephy. There's a new show starting on channel 10 next Thursday at 7.30pm. They're kicking off 'Teen Fit Camp', dunno why, it's not *that* bad a show. Ah, whatever. Anyway, this new&nbsp;show's&nbsp;called 'Pirate Master'. It looks like a survivor thing, but I'm still interested in it. Cameron Daddo! YAY! <br />Oh, and at 10pm on Channel 31 'Planet Nerd' is on. It's a good show, and it's got local comedians on it. Ben McKenzie being one of them, and also Rob Lloyd, this will interest Stephy Wephy.... He's the guy that looks like Dr Who, he was in Trades bottom bar a lot. He also reviewed The Muppets dvd. Hehe! So, yeah! It's a cool show. They're cool nerds. and BMcK is my photo buddy. Yay. Hee hee. :-)<br /><br />I smell like frangipani :-) yay! I sprayed some body mist on myself when i was in the pharmacy today. It was lots of fun.&nbsp;So there you go. Ben built a new comp for Dad, to put in his study. I'm trying to get him to give up on this crap-arse one, it's so slow and crap-arse. He said he needs to update his accounting program. Woo. Go him.<br />Hopefully next week, I'll hopefully be better, coz I'm hopefully goin to Geelong and Warnambool with some people for a roadtrip. So that will be muchly fun.&nbsp;I hope.

"event","Yup. Glandular Fever it is.<br /><br />I'm feeling alright now. I'm sleeping alright, but a bit too much, I think. Wait, I can't complain, it's all good.&nbsp;<br />Had another blood test on monday. Didn't faint from it that time. Yay. Goin to doctor tomorrow. I miss socialising. Shopping. <strike>Tafe.</strike> What else... Seeing People. Outside. Friends. <br /><br />What's been goin on... well, Mum, Dad and I went to Heritage Golf Club (in the new car) on Sunday to check it out. Why? I don't know. Dad likes golf. 'Nuff said. It was&nbsp;so lovely. So very green. It's only about 30-40 mins away from Park Orchards, in Wonga Park. It's a nice place. Then we went to Warran Glen Nursery for Devonshire Tea, being the posh people we are. I had peppermint tea. It was so good. Cleansing and aromatic. Good stuff. :-) I mentioned we got a new car. Yes. It's a new Honda Accord Luxury. It's a dark silver colour and had a sunroof, GPS, Funky dark interior and lots of room. it's cool. So there ya go. Sunday was my first time in it. First time.. riding... in it. Being a passenger. *sigh*<br /><br />I'm thinking of goin into Tafe to see what I've missed. That should be fun. Woo. Caitlin (friend from Tafe) is coming over on Sunday, to give me the props they borrowed for theatre. That reminds me, I still have that library book. I'm so screwed, it's like, 50c a day if it's overdue. Feck. It was due back on the 25th of May. Crap. That's a whole $6 i owe them. I should've called up. I might even call up and say that I've been sick, which is true, and haven't been able to call sooner because I couldn't talk. (which is not true. Bwahaha.) I hope they pity me. They better. Damn library people. *shakes fist*&nbsp;<br /><br />I have a dilemma. I'm invited to a 21st AND Engagement Party on the 16th June, the 21 year old is the engaged person too. Old Neighbour, Adrian's (who&nbsp;I used to go to school with)&nbsp;financee, Merryn. Got that? Yeah. That's at the Templestowe Hotel. On the same night, I have another 21st, in Olinda (the sticks). That's my old best friend from primary school, Adrienne. I don't think I can drive there at night, unless I get a lift. It also depends if I'm feeling up for goin out, which I'm pretty sure I should be, coz I feel a bit better now anyway. Waaaa. Annoying. Doncha hate that?<br /><br />Ah well, we'll see what happens. My life's goin weird at the moment. I think so anyway. I feel like I'm out of the loop with people, like I'm in my own little world. Can't socialise, can't drive anywhere, can't see anyone.. It's weird. I don't want to give anyone this dreaded Fever thing, of course, but, I feel like it's kinda gone... apparently it stays with you for god knows how long, and can come up again out of the blue. It sucks. I cbf catching up on all the shyte I've missed out on,&nbsp;my cool tafe mate Dan said it's fine, and for me not to worry too much about all the stuff I've missed, the LOs (Learning Outcomes) and homework etc. I've been wantin to pull out, I feel I've given up,&nbsp;sorta like&nbsp;the&nbsp;'can't be bothered with it anymore' attitude, to which some people are against....&nbsp;<br /><br />Life can be shit sometimes, in more ways than one.&nbsp;<br /><br />Note for the records: I have a tender spleen."

"event","Yep. There is something wrong with me.

I think I may have Tonsilitis and Glandular Fever.&nbsp;

Hey Jo, whatcha reckon? I've been sick since last Tuesday, so, since the 22nd of May, I'm all-over body achey, hot and cold sweats, insomnia,&nbsp;bit dizzy, sore throat, headaches, sensitive hearing, flaring glands, sore nose from blowing it, tired, oh, and phlegm. Ewww, lots of that. Sorry guys..So yeah, still sick. Not much phlegm now though. I like typing that word. Phlegm. Haha, try and say it.. ""Ph-LEG-M."" *sigh* I'm so tired. 

I went to a clinic on Sunday, because my doctor, who has his clinic on Blackburn Rd, has gone on a holiday with his family and isn't coming back til June 18th or something... anyway, went to Box Hill Pathology, on Nelson Rd.&nbsp;
Saw a nice doctor lady. Prescribed me drugs. Yay! They're very beneficial. Work very well.. so, yeah. had a blood test today at Melbourne Pathology, in Doncaster. I felt all dizzy after it. My vision went blurry, was swaying, just couldn't focus or anything. Was weird. So I lay down on the bed for 10 mins and was ok after that. But it was a weird feeling.
If this is Glandular, it will take about 12 weeks to get over or something.. so will miss a lot of tafe. Great. That's fantastic. 

Missed my Deaf Theatre Performance, which I was looking forward to.. it's ok though, someone taped it, so yay.
Will probably miss Ben's ceremony on Wednesday, sorry Benny... and probably no human contact for a while. Just hibernate in my room for however long it takes. Great! ah well, a bit better than Tafe I guess. Still gotta catch up on homework and learning outcomes, which I'm really&nbsp;not looking forward to, and ah crap i have a&nbsp;library book overdue. It costs 50c a day if it's overdue. Dammit. It was due back last&nbsp;friday. Meh. 

Can't be arsed jobsearching, because I'm sick, and there's not really much point, seeing as I'm not sure what I have, when it'll go away and plus the fact that I can't speak properly... my throat hurts when I try and swallow liquids and food. And when I yawn. It's so bad. It's ouchies. Like, very ouchies.

What else can I complain about? I've lost about 5 kgs coz I haven't eaten anything for almost a week. Living on occasional bowl of yogurt with honey in it, jasmine and green tea, panadol lemon drink, hot water and honey, and chicken noodle cup a soup, rarely. 

Anyway, that's probably most of my ranting for another couple of days. Sorry for complaing again. My life's going all bizarre. That's all. Not so perfect timing, I say.&nbsp; Taking a turn for the worst? Perhaps. Who knows. 

Thanks for reading all my uneccessary&nbsp;blabbery.&nbsp;"

"event","Ok. Long time no post. 

I feel like shit. I'm sick. Sore throat, achey, dizzy, tired. There's definately something wrong with me. 

Great timing, we have our Deaf Theatre Perfomance THIS FRIDAY NIGHT. Friggin great! Ah well, least I don't have to say anything. Rock. 

Everything's happening at once. Tafe (which will get even more&nbsp;intense next semester, my last 6 gruelling months from July. Yay.) I really want to drop out. Parents don't want me to though. I wonder why, perhaps coz they're paying? Yeah. That's right.&nbsp; 

Still contemplating my career, to teach or not to teach? In my brain, it sounds like a good career. I just really can't be arsed to keep studying though. I'm getting sick of it. I'm wanting to do something music/photography related instead. Tried 3 photo studios in the city. Nothing. At all. I could always could go back to Auslan later on. It's something I can put on my resume, another language under my belt. yay. 

I really need to go away. Away somewhere with friends. Away from my wretched parents. Away during the holidays. Interstate even. A&nbsp;roatrip even.&nbsp;Yeah, that would be ideal... if only I had the money.&nbsp;*sigh* 

I still have no job. Fuck that. I'm so annoyed. Got turned down by 'Juniper's Cafe' in Mitcham. I had a trial and everything! Damn them. They hired someone with 'experience', so there goes that opportunity. Great. I'm never gonna&nbsp;get a job. So annoyed. Also got an email tonight from BWS (Beer Wine and Spirits) in Mitcham, well, Woolworths. They didn't accept me either. Hmm. Life sucks sometimes.. no, wait, all the time, in my life anyway. 

My best friend's boyfriend's back in perth in a Clinic, so i feel sad for her, I've got so many things happening. it's annoying. 

Ah well. Whatever.&nbsp;"

"event","Aw, comfest's over! What a busy few weeks it's been! 

I took a few days off shows. And tried to relax a bit.&nbsp; 

Ok, the last&nbsp;time I updated was Sunday. Monday I went to the Caption Centre for&nbsp;a Tafe excursion. Better than I thought it'd be. they caption NEIGHBOURS there! I was in my element. What a cool job that'd be. I know, I'm a sad neighbours addict.&nbsp; 

On Tuesday, I went and saw 'DIE ROTEN PUNKTE'! They were so good. so much fun!! I got a CD and a couple of badges. They are so cool. I like Otto. He's nice. :-) 

Wedensday (ANZAC Day) met Ben in the city and we got a tram to St Kilda. We bought Fish and Chips and sat on the beach and ate them. Awww! Romantic! It was lovely. Bit cold in the shade too. Ah well, still nice.. 

Thusday boring old tafe. Had the David Lawton Award. He (David Lawton) was an Auslan student from my tafe, Kangan Batman Tafe. Apparently he was a really nice guy, he died in a motorbike accident. Every year they have an award to remember him and give to&nbsp;a student who's been a great person, role model, student or a good friend to everyone. It's always a nice occasion, anything to get out of class. Woo!&nbsp; 

Friday went to 80s Enuff with Sam, Bec, Steve. Was rockin! Lots and lots of fun! Dave Callan got a mention, because his dancing was fantastic. Actually, did you know that Otto was the lead singer for 80s enuff? yeah, i though that was cool too. He went by another name, and also sported a very believable&nbsp;English accent, very well done. :-D 

Also, Mum and Dad went away for the weekend on a Golfing trip, so i had the house to myself, even though I spent most of my time out... comedy-ing and partying. 

Saturday was fantastic. Went to see Justin Hamilton's Show, '3 Colours Hammo', all 3 of them from 2pm - 5.30pm. It was brilliant. Definately on my top 5 list, along with Lawrence Leung, Tim Minchin, Adam Hills and&nbsp;Die Roten Punkte. :-) 
I cried. More in the last one than the 2nd one.. It was an awesome story, all three of them made one big story.. and it was so touching and emotional! Most people cried I think.. So good. Comedian Central there too. That was fun. Free tea and coffee! Zaaaahh! [Hire 'Dukes of Hazzard' and you'll get the ZAAAHH thing. I intend to. Just for that.] But yeah, fantastic show by Hammo. *gives it the thumbs up* 

That night I also saw Ben McKenzie's (see previous post) show, 'Science-ology'. That was great. and it was in the TARDIS! (Little room at the Bottom Bar in Trades Hall.) Was cool! Great show. Very interesting. I also took pictures, he asked for them, so&nbsp;I sent them to him the next day. He's cool. go to wwwlabcoatman.com.au. His site. :-)&nbsp;Also went to Kerry's 20th party. Op shop theme. That was fun. Wore my $8 black op shop jacket. Jo still beats everyone though. A Safeway green $2 dress! Was awesome! Nice work, Jo ;-) 

Sunday, saw Adam Hills to finish off the Festival. FRIGGIN FANTASTIC! I think it was a great choice. Went with Ben. He enjoyed it too. :-) So much fun! Had teh interpreter, Nikki, too. She was great. And, did you guys see Rove that night? Adam had to go from his last gig to Rove, and he took these 2 lovely Perth ladies with him!! They were in theor 80s or 90s, and they were so cute! Tell me if you saw them, i haven't seen it yet, but Ben's dad taped it for us, so should see it soon. After Adam, caught up with the gang at Max Brenners in QV. Got a Venuzuelan Dark Chocolate. Mmmm.. so good. :-) Nice to spend the last day with the comedy friend group and my Ben :-) Yay! Mum and Dad came home Sunday night. 

So here I am. I've had the weirdest day today. Left Tafe early, coz I felt like crap. It's hard to hold back tears in class, therefore drawing attention to oneself. That wasn't my intention. Damn. I just had this weird feeling, i have a cough, a headache, felt a bit dizzy. So i might take a day off tomorrow.&nbsp;It was the strangest thing. Seriously. Lacking confidence in everything I do, thinking about my future, or trying not to, bizarre feelings, depressed for some crazy reason, weird mood syndrome. Freaky. 

I have recently just been looking up photography places on yellowpages.com.au. I might go into the city tomorrow afternoon and give out CVs. Wish me luck! I need it! Might continue doing that Wednesday too. I'm looking at Photography studios.. shops.. whatever. Taking a day off is good, I can sleep in, try and get better and clear my head, get rid of stress and relax a bit more. Good o. 

&nbsp;Anyways, please excuse my babbling. But if you enjoyed reading it, thanks. Leave a comment. You know you want to. ;-)"

All in previous post. :D Yay for them!<br /><u>Fri 6th</u> -&nbsp;Easter Shindig during the Day, and Housesitting friends' place, so a nice relaxing night. :-)<br /><u>Sat 7th</u> - Dave Callan at Melb Town Hall. Good, but had to crane my neck a bit. Was up in the side bit... annoying. Also had an biatch of a woman in front of me who kept moving her head! GRARGH!<br /><u>Sunday 8th</u> - Duckdive and Little Stevies Gig at The Evelyn. That was fun.. Took pix for the guys too. Yay!<br /><u>Monday 9th</u> - Nothing. I know, can you believe it?!<br /><u>Tuesday 10th&nbsp;</u> - 'Lawrence Leung Learns to Breakdance' &lt;--- awesome show. go see it! ;-D <br /><br />Was up to here. <br /><u><br />Wednesday 11th </u>- Andy McClelland's show, that&nbsp;I can never remember the title of, unless I look it up somewhere. <br /><u>Thursday 12th </u>- I saw Matt Elsbury's show, 'Meaning...?'&nbsp;at the Pony, with Robyn, Becs, Stephy. That was good. <br />Friday the 13th (oooooh)&nbsp;- ElbowSkin 'Sparring Partners' and got a free COLANDER (haha.)&nbsp;Then hung round Trades Hall.. and saw the 80's Enuff Band, which rocked my socks off. :-D <br /><u>Saturday 14th</u> - &nbsp;Lawrence Mooney in 'Where To?', he was better than expected.. ^_^ and very good. <br /><u>Sunday 15th</u>&nbsp; - went to Ben's for dinner. :-) <br /><u>Monday&nbsp;16th </u>- The 4 Noels with Lauren. Very silly. but quite amusing.&nbsp;<br /><u>Tuesday 17th</u> - Andy Muirhead. AWESOME! He was great. Ben and I sat in the front row. Andy talked to me. He told me that i shouldn't watch Midsomer Murders, because that's a sign you're geting old. It's alright though, coz I don't watch it anyway.<br /><u>Wednesday 18th</u> - Tim Minchin. 'So F**king Rock.' That's what his show was called. ROCKING. I loved it. I got a tim minchin canvas bag, too. it's cool :-) He was definately one of my faves. I loved it. After Tim, went and saw Alison Bice in 'The Wizard of Bice'. A bit bizarre, but it was alright.&nbsp;<br /><u>Thursday 19th</u> - Alan Brough. Very interesting. Different. Quite different. But it was alright I suppose. :-)<br /><u>Friday 20th</u> - Sarah Phillips Party, Yay! That was fun. Cookies! *dances* and booze! *dances more*&nbsp;<br /><u>Saturday 21st</u>&nbsp;- 'Josh Earl is a Librarian'. Awesome show. He asked me about getting my wisdom teeth out, coz he had his out and his friends didn't care. so he made up a song, about his 'Wizzies'. Funny. Then at 11.45pm, yep, you read right... went to Trades after coming back from Lygon St, we got icecream. Mmmm.. we went to 'BirdHouse'. Twas a gig with lots of nice comedians singing 'They Might Be Giants' songs. Was rocking!! :D Got some vids and pix... so, yay! Rove was there too. That was pretty cool. And so was my cousin Kirsty! I didn't know she was singing, she sang with Scod. Was nice. :-) So, that's pretty much the update.&nbsp;<br /><u>Sunday 22nd</u> (tonight)&nbsp;- Nothing. Relaxing again! yay. <br /><br />15 shows! Rock and Roll.<br /><br />Will make Tuesday my 16th, and perhaps a 17th and 18th show. Wouldn't mind seeing Ben McKenzie's show, 'Science-ology'. Ben McKenzie is my photo buddy. <em>[Information: There's a project thing at Trades' Bottom Bar, where you go find a stranger, and then give&nbsp;a donation and sit in this little photobooth thingo. You don't know when your pic's being taken, so you just make small talk with your stranger. It was way cool. It may sound a bit freaky, but it's awesome fun. I have the pics in my wallet if you wanna see :-D hehe.]</em> Ben McKenzie also sang at the 80s Enough and BirdHouse gigs. He's a cool singer. :-D<br /><br />Also planned this week:<br /><br /><u>Tuesday 24th</u> - Ben McKenzie, 'Science-ology', as mentioned before... <br /><br /><u>Friday &nbsp;27th</u> - Tripod's Idio Clips (perhaps) + '80's Enuff' again. It's free, and at 11.30pm, so, yeah.<br /><br /><u>Sunday 29th</u> - Adam Hills. YAY! I should get a ticket sometime, incase it sells out!&nbsp;<br /><br />Ahhh, I love it. My favourite time of the year. I'm contemplating volunteering/applying for work there next year. Wooo. There's no such thing as too much comedy. EVER."

Watching Foxtel. <br /><br />Saturday Night: 9.30pm <strong>Dave Callan</strong>.<br /><br />Sunday Night: no comedy, but went to see The Little Stevies and Duckdive and Hazel Brown at the Evelyn. Actually, I did see comedy, Andy McClelland joined the Ducks, coming straight from his show. yeah. that's the rock and roll lifestyle&nbsp;for ya. Maybe.<br /><br />About the Shows:<br /><br />Tripod -&nbsp; This was different to last years, geez, way different. A bit disturbing, hmmm, whether to ruin the surprise.. ner, I'll let you be shocked by yourselves.. <strike>Lycra makes an appearance. That's all I have to say. *shudders*</strike> Um, i also got told off for taking pictures. Grrr! But I got a couple of good ones. haha. *dances* Slideshow presentation by Yonny&nbsp;was very&nbsp;funny.&nbsp;I say&nbsp;3 out of 5 for Tripod.<br /><br />Jason&nbsp;Byrne - I didn't know what to expect from this fellow, I hadn't seen him live before.. so, I kept an open mind. He was skitz. He really was. Hilariously funny though. He picked on people in the audience, nicked someone's salt and vinegar chips, escorted a 'hypnotised' man back to his seat. Friggin funny. He has a lovely Irish accent. Mmmm.. irish. he had a story about his 6 year old son. Twas very funny. :-D Crikey! I give him a 4. &lt;-- I know more than Tripod! <br /><br />MBG - as always, rockin. :-P 5 out of 5. Took some pix. Whole gang was there. Free gig. Great to see Brisbanites Stephy (<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://cool-boof.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://cool-boof.livejournal.com/""><b>cool_boof</b></a></div>) and Pete as well!!!! I also scored a free Canadian Club Lumberjack Hat! WOO! It has ear flaps, and it's kinda tweed-like.. hee hee! Ok, almost everyone in the bottom bar of Trades Hall had one. EVEN STEPHY, AND SPARKY, AND JAMES. I was driving that night, so I couldn't buy/drink any CC Whiskey. Here's how my sweet-talking went:<br /><br />Me: ""Hey, I was wondering, do you have to buy Canadian Club to get one of those cool hats?""<br />Awesome-Bar-Man-With-Dreads: ""Well, it's preferable....""<br />Me: ""Ah.. you see, I'm driving tonight. I'm a designated driver, and I think those hats are really awesome. Could I possibly get one? Pleeease?"" *angelic smile*<br />A-B-M-W-D: ""Errmm, Hmmm.. Let's see.. *looks around, under the bar, in the display* Ok, here ya go..""<br />Me: ""Woo! Thankyou so much!!"" *puts it on, points* ""Hey! Look!"" *to Anthony and Jen* ""Wooo!""<br />Anthony: ""Oh my god... I want one!!!!"" *goes to the bar and immediately makes friends with the Bar Guy* &lt;--- lol, stephy did that too. <br /><br />Later on, Anthony got a CC hat, dodgy bling necklace AND white CC sunnies. LOL! He then gave his dodgy bling to the Kebab Man on Doncater Rd and scored a free Pepsi. This was at 4am. ROFL! <br /><br />Dave Callan - This was great. Apart from the fact that I was in the balcony seat.. 2nd row, looking down and towards the left. With this friggin ANNOYING woman in front of me.. she was moving her head around, side to side, I just wanted to punch her&nbsp;out, so she'd get out of my field of vision... The seats were creaky, my neck hurt :-( on the upside, there was a nice irish (*giggle*) comedy guy, showing people to their seats. Yay for irish.&nbsp; I took some pix of dave, but they were a bit blurry. Meh. I also went by myself. First time ever to a comedy show. Ah well. Afterwards, I was waiting for Stephy and Steve and Pete, coz they went to see Jason Byrne, and Dave Callan walked past me!!! I got shivers. And I was excited too. I said, ""Hey, Dave! Great show!"" He replied with, ""Thanks.... great scarf!"" LOL. I was wearing my funky colourful rainbow scarf. I got tingles. I also saw Fiona O'Loughlin with&nbsp;2 of her 5 kids, Adam Richard wandering around with some very gay friends, and also Charlie Pickering. Yay.<br /><br />After that, Steve, Sam, Stephy and Pete (who doesn't have a name which can be alliteration-ised with the others...) came out of Jason Byrne's show. We went to Cue Bar for some Pool. Yaaaaaaay! Steve and Sam took a cab, while me, stephy and petey took, my car.. I should've driven them all, i feel bad for not taking the other two.. Grr.&nbsp;<br /><br />Pool was fun. Robyn was there also. and Teagy Weagy (<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://charlichocer.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://charlichocer.livejournal.com/""><b><font color=""#0000ff"">charlichocer</font></b></a></div>), Jules and others also came. :-)&nbsp;<br /><br />Wow. What a big start to the weekend. I went to Duckdive last night, which was awesome. I got there early, and wandered up and down Brunswick street looking at stuff in windows, in shops, and talked to a nice english lady who worked in a clothes shop. I talked to her about the awesome clothes she had in this shop, they had awesome tops, skirts, dresses. I also said, ""Hmm, if only i had money to buy them..."" and she said, ""Oh, are you studying?"" and we talked about how to find work, and she suggested doorknocking different shops and stuff, she was cool. Anyway, yeah, wandered rounf some more and bumped into all the Duckies, who were going to find some food. So, I wanted to be cool, so I hung out with them for a bit, out the front of Souvlaki King. Man, I was shit hot. <strike>*sigh* I'm such a groupie</strike>. LOL.&nbsp;So, yeah, I took heaps of photos for the guys. Also met this other guy who was there, and interested in my photography... he asked me all these questions, like, ""Do you have a site where you put up all your pics?"", ""How long have you been doing photography?"", ""have you heard of Greg [from Duckdive]'s other band? 'Slow Human Movement'? He plays this weird instrument, and he actually wears a snorkel/mask to play it.. really good photo opportunites..."" Or at least I think that's what he said. He was nice though. His name was Alex. Hurray for Alex.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hmmm. The gig was cool. I had fun.&nbsp;<br /><br />What else.. Ben and I might go and see either Andy's or Lawrence's Shows tomorrow night. Should be fun. :-) Finally I can drag ben to something comedy-related. yay.&nbsp;<br /><br />Other Shows/People I would like to see at ComFest:<br /><br />*Tim Minchin<br />*Danny Bhoy (Raawwrrr)<br />*Andy McClelland [maybe Tues]<br />*Lawrence Leung [maybe Tues]<br />*Ross Noble<br />*Adam Hills<br />*Umbilical Brothers<br />*Scared Weird Little Guys<br />*Tom Gleeson<br />*Die Roten Punkte <br />*Harley Breen<br />*Daniel Kitson<br />*4 Noels<br />*Alan Brough<br />*Fiona O'Loughlin<br />*Laughapoolooza<br />*Smells Like A Song<br /><br />Probably more, as my brain isn't really in the mood for thinking of various lists that I have continuously written out.. uh, yeah.&nbsp;<br />I also need money, as that is indeed an integral part of the ticket buying process... I wish I had a job. Although Anthony said he may try and get me one at NAB in King St.. Woooo... job.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm sorry for the long long long post. Haha! Thanks for taking the time and the patience to read it! Again, if you read it all, every single little (in)significant word, you deserve a big Maddie hug.. <br /><br />In other news, I am currently doing a '6 Week Challenge' with my gym, Contours, and I am in my&nbsp;3rd week I think.. and have lost 2 or 3 kgs. YAY! I know it's not much, but it's a start, and being EASTER doesn't help. I'm a bit ashamed to say I've been eating easter eggs like no tomorrow... (Don't tell mum) but I have not touched ONE Hot Cross Bun at all. WOOOT! Happy happy joy joy. The food on this 'diet' is really good. Like, REALLY good. I have found a new love, Jalna Yogurt. MMMMMMMMMM! (Vanilla is the best. Go buy it. NOW!) <br /><br />So yeah. Rock On.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, I should go to bed. I'm very tired, and I should be getting up reasonably early to have a proper breakfast with this eating plan thing, and not have it at like, 11am, like I have been doing. It goes like this... breakfast, mid-morning snack, late-morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, and optional supper, which is a protein shake. I've been skipping the morning snacks, which isn't good, and the gym's been closed over easter (except saturday... but i still didn't go to it.. Damn..) so will tomorrow.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, there ya go. To sum up.... <strike>I had a very interesting and very long explanationy past few days.</strike>... *sigh*<br /><br />ah screw that... <br /><br />[Final Note - You can see how geeky I am by putting everyone's LJ username in brackets. I'm sorry guys, I hope you don't mind, and I like making it go blue, and it looks nice and impressive, and.. yeah, sorry again :-P ... and I like the crossing-outy tool thing. <strike>SEE!?</strike> SEE?! <strike>SEE??</strike>]"

"event","<p>I've been thinking about stuff. Recently. Just stuff. Stuff like my career, my studies, my image, my life...<br /><br />I'm not sure if I want a career in Sign Language, Teaching or ChildCare. I don't think I have the necessary skills to become an interpreter. I've forgotten all my Chinese and French, since I've taken up a new language. I miss my photography, well, i still take pix, but I don't develop my own film anymore.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've started a new diet, a '6 Week Challenge' with my gym, Contours.. It's only been a week, but I think I've lost 1 kg,&nbsp;it's hard to say, when it teeters between kilos all the time, I feel like i'm goin to be this way forever, and never lose weight, and never be proud of the way I look. Geez, I'm so friggin negative about my life.&nbsp;I don't have any confidence anymore.. <br /><br />I'm sick of applying for jobs and then being rejected. If they advertise for people, why do they say 'no, we don't want you'...? 'You're not good enough. Get some qualifications.' That's not what they actually said, but it sure feels like it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Waiting on another company to get back to me regarding an application. Childrens Relieving Agency. Please, give me a job, somebody. I need money, I can't live like this, poor, and scabbing money off my parents all the time. I hate relying on other people for money. I need money to live. I need money for a car. To do things, other than buy friggin $5 'concession' metcards to get to Tafe. That's all I can afford.&nbsp;<br /><br />So sombre tonight, sorry guys. Guess I've just in a shitty mood. I just don't know what I want in my life. Not yet, anyway. Just a job to start would be nice. Perhaps.<br /><br />Life sucks sometimes.</p>"

I'm listening to 'You To Thank' and I love the lyrics, and the piano, it gives me that warm, fuzzy feeling..

And like I wanna get up and dance like mad to it.. he's a friggin awesome pianist! 
His songs remind me of kali_grrr....

Dunno why though, maybe coz you also listen to him, Robyn?

Anyone suggest getting his other album? I don't know if it's the newest one..

Now I'm listening to The Annoying Song, by zee Godboys. Interesting..."

Where was I? Ummm.. I can't remember what I talked about in my last LJ..&nbsp;

That was eons ago!! hang ON... *copies this blabber*&nbsp;

*pastes it again* Ok, Apollo bay, that was ages ago.

Ummm, Friday arvo&nbsp;I went for an interview at The Pancake Parlour at Eastland.. seemed to go pretty well, I need a phone reference from the Campion people, so then I can email the number tot he pancake parlour chicky.. who will then hopefully call campion, and ask them about me, and they will reply with nice things, and tell her that I'm responsible and on time and everything, then she will then call me back for a 2nd interview. *breathes* yeah. Friday night went to Leonie's bf's palce for a girls night. that was fun. Yeah, the irony. her boyfriend Andrew and his brother live there, but they weren't home.. we got fish and chips for dinner and watched 'Clueless'. Piss funny movie. Then drove back with Lauren, singing along to Disney songs. Awww, harmonies rock.

Saturday slept til about 10, went to eastland with mum to buy a white 'waitress-y' looking shirt, sat night waitressed at our frien Eryn's Engagement party, earned $70.. Wooot! 

Sunday went into the city to see the Birdman Rally (scott the magive dragon rocked). Great costume Scotty!! *thumbs up* That was cool, Frank Woodley was hosting it! Wooo! I gots pictures of him, and city stuff.. wandered around, went to Melb Central by myself for lunch, then came home, put washing out for mum, did some homework, watched tv. Monday, which is today..&nbsp; I slept in til 11 am, sweeeeet.. then stuffed around, had lunch, sat in the sun, Benny came over, i took some pix of his car...

That's pretty much it, and I've been texting Lee's boyfriend Edd most of tonight. He's cool.. :-) Lee is my cool cuz in England. He is gay, and he loves Neighbours (the tv show...) and his bf's name's Edd. He is so nice.. He works in a chocolate shop. Lee works in a Homewares shop I think. AND HE'S COMIN DOWN HERE IN AUGUST - SEPTEMBER! WOOOOO!

Yes. Exciting News. And Comfest is soon. I really need this job. Pleeeeeeeeease! Oh, and I'm also thinking of doing this '6 Week Challenge' with my gym, Contours. They put you on a spesh diet thingy, must gym 3 times a week, spesh protien powder etc, I really wanna do it. I think I might. I'd love to lose some weight.. I really would.&nbsp;

Now it's time for last-minute-due-tomorrow-homework-cramming. Night all ^_^

It's awesome if you were wondering. :-) I'm glad I have a camera in my phone now, my life is complete. Hee hee! <br /><br />Oh, and apologies in advance for the mega post!! Have fun reading it!<br /><br />Apollo bay was gorgeous. I'll be uploading pix on Flickr sometime soon, perhaps tomorrow arvo even.... Anyway, ""What did we do?"" I hear you ask...... Weeelll.....<br /><br />-Played Poker (I almost won my <u>first</u> game against my ex...)<br />-Shared a couple of houses. The one we (Me, Ben, Brendan, Jess, Kerry, Jordi, Claire, Jane, Sarah&nbsp;and Middo) were in, 'Old Tuxion Cottage', was very nice (apart from a dead rabbit on the lawn), and very cosy. IT HAD 5 COWS... (actually Steers.. not cows, they were boy cattle.) ...IN THE NEXT PROPERTY! I was in my element. :-D Stayed in that&nbsp;house last year too. The rest of the gang (Jean, Kabel, Jeff, Tony, Fei, Ashley, Alan, Jo, Courtney, Hayden, Alicia, Nessa, Katie, other Ben, Simon, Jen, Chris, Andy) were all in the&nbsp;other house, 'Taqwa'. It&nbsp;was pretty comfy, besides the fact it was falling apart... The fridge apparently caught on fire.. (!?!?!), the couch's arm kept getting worse, hanging by a few threads.. what else.. a mirror on the&nbsp;ceiling (yes...) of the master bedroom.. dodgey flywire on the front door.. bizarre pond thing in the backyard with ukky water in it.. pool with no water.. Ah well. It was live-able. :-)<br />-Went on lovely (bush)walks.. to waterfalls (Marriners.. [sp?]...&nbsp;Falls - there's a pic of the sign... so there ya go. :-) It was a ncie walk...), regularly to the shops, the beach, other houses..&nbsp;<br />-The beach was awesome. (photos on flickr within the next couple of days..) went body boarding with ben, he brought down some wetsuits and boards.. (wetsuits rock!)<br />-Got sexy beach hair.. (like you did, <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://charlichocer.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://charlichocer.livejournal.com/""><b>charlichocer</b></a></div>!) Hee hee!<br />-Got drunk... yes.. you read right.... well,&nbsp;I blame the guy everyone blames, Tony Schwartz. Bastard. I think I had 2 Strongbows (cider), then about 5 or 6 bourbon and cokes... Tony said there were only 2 shots in them... well, my first few there were.. coz I made them, but later he added a few more.. in each drink.. i was the tipsiest I've ever been. swaying from side to side, see.. I remember that! Umm, and telling Tony that the poker chips were tintern colours.. (green, white and blue...) *sigh* Then I made popcorn with Kerry.. kernels went everywhere.. yet i was knowledgeable enough to see where they went and picked them up and put the fluffy covered ones in the bin. Weird. Jean sat me down, and gave me a bucket, just in case, but good thing is, nothing bucket-related happened. :-) Then I remember being put in the bottom bunk that night/morning, as I was way too uncoordinated to go in the top one, which I had 'shotgunned' earlier that day... We had to move from OTC to Taqwa, coz people (including Ben) left that day, or earlier.. so no point in still having the two houses.<br />-Buried Tony in the sand at the beach. Ah yes, an annual occurrence. Same thing happened last year, cept Ben tickled his feet. Friggin hilarious.. I&nbsp;have video evidence. ;-)&nbsp;<br />-Oh yea, about the cattle that were in the paddock next to us, I couldn't help myself one morning, and climbed into the paddock with them. Yes. I am bovine obsessed. Not in a dirty way though. No bad thoughts, people. Thankyou. :D I have about 40 photos of the lovely fresians. A bit overboard, I know. Brendan got a good pic of me patting them on the nose, and one licking my hand. While you're at my Flickr account, go to Brendan's photos, they rock. A lot. :-) Anyway, yeah, I went into the paddock, talked to the cows, coz I can do that. Gave them a scratch, they gave me a light, friendly lick and also a head-butting, it was so cute. }:-p &lt;-- &lt;-- maybe a cow. I don't know. Yeah, ben came home that mornin, after goin into town with Middo to get a beachtowel... and helped me out of the paddock. LOL. Good old garden bench saved me. Oh, and so did Ben, obviously. Good timing, I guess. :D<br /><br />I think that's it! :D<br /><br />Back at tafe now. Still unemployed. Applied to Angus and Robertson online the other night. *crosses fingers* Hopefully I get that job, coz I really want it...&nbsp;<br /><br />Comfest is coming up!!! ARRGGHHH!! MY FAVE TIME OF YEAR, AND I'M ALMOST BROKE! EEEK! Unless people wanna shout me tix to shows, I won't complain. ;-) Hee hee! I'm lucky some of my friends are also comedians.. and have free shows.. I think.. ;-)&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, I hope I haven't bored you all to death. If you read everything, you deserve a BIG Maddie hug. Next time I see you, I will give that to you. I pwomise! Hee Hee!<br /><br />Night all. ;-) Maddie Moo Cow xoxo<br /><br />p.s - It's Friday soon! HURRAY! *dances*&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I've already got homework. Great. The theory goes, if you're away the day of the L.O (Learning Outcome) you have to write a 300-500 wod report, covering all the criteria... Blahblahblahblah.

The internet is extremely slow, the desktop comes up with problems all the time, msn won't work on it at all, XP doesn't work properly, so we have to run it on Windows 2000, there's occasionally a horrible blue screen , which we refer to as 'The Blue Screen Of Death', it comes up and it says 'Starting Memory Dump', which has happened a lot, and is never a good thing.. ARGH! PIECE OF SHIT! ...And my father says it suits him fine! It works for him when he's on it, he blames most of the stuff ups and frozen screens on msn, which I can't use anyway on this.. I wish I could just throw this away and get a new computer without him noticing.. He's got his Quickbooks (Tax program) and all his work docos on here, I just want him to get a fucking new computer but he won't. GRAH!

Anyway.. I saw 'Dream Girls' tonight with Lauren and Steph, (friends from school) and it was a 'meh' movie. I wanna see Happy Feet and The Holiday.. anyone wanna go with? Doubt Ben will.. he never gets in touch with his feminine side. LOL. Ben. Feminine. *sigh* He's a cutie. 

Potential job opportunity tomorrow. Steph Gibbo's picking me up at 11... provided my resume's printed. *shakes fist at the printer* We're goin to her work, a little jewellery shop behind Tunstall Square :) Wish me luck!

I was on my way to livejournal.com, but accidentally typed in 'liverjournal.com'. Damn.. If that was an actual site, I think it may go something like this...

""Dear Journal. Today my liver hates me. And it hurts.. I punched it. It punched me back. Will update tomorrow.""

What the hell? Ok, so I'm kinda tired. Went to Jess T's 20th last night. I think I was the only one who had alcohol.. 3 breezers. I also stayed the night there. My head hurt this morning. Yes, I know, I'm weak.. well a 'cadbury'.. according to my boyfriend, anyway. :P

I'm not too tired to Mahjong my night away tonight though! yay! Mahjong night at Jo's. Yay! Should be good.

Hmm, last night was good. I may have a new phone in a bit, a new job... it's good.

Hippy (Melissa) :-) said she has a new phone, and asked if I wanted her 'old' phone, it's a Nokia 7270, I think.. awesome red and black flip phone.. Gorgeous phone, costs around $500 - $700. Hippy said I could have it for $50! WOW! Hopefully.. I'll get it! yay! and trust me, this phone's not 'old'. Also a possible job opportunity at a little jewellery place behind Tunstall Square too! Maybe. Gotta check my timetable for tafe though.. and maybe part-time work at my beloved Campion, again, depending on my timetable. YAY!

Saw 'Blood Diamond' with Ben today. Good movie, bit violent, child soldiers, depressing, sad.. I cried. Leo puts on a nice Sth African accent though. Ben always takes me to movies and I cry! What is this! Ah well, still, good movies.. lol, cried in 'Pursuit of Happyness' and now this one.. I might drag him along to Happy Feet. That'll show him. :-P 
We're thinking of going to see the Shaolin Monks.. that looks awesome!!!
That reminds me, I have to look up prices and such.

Grr. I hate that. Any suggestions? Like, new songs out now, or funky type stuff.. Thanks in advance.. ;)

Hmm, so much for getting a health care card this year, I don't think it's possible to get one anymore.. I've been waiting on my friggin-stupid-ex-boss-woman to give me my payslips from the 28th of NOVEMBER to the 24th of DECEMBER. I need my payslips from the last 8 weeks to give to Centrelink. I've gone into the shop twice. She hasn't been there. This is so annoying. The form was supposed to be in yesterday (the 10th).. so much for that.

On a nicer yet bizarre note, i had the weirdest dream last night. I dreamt I went to a gig, with my mate Steph Gibson.. and we saw Kisschasy. But then there was another room where we walked into and Adam Hills was doing a gig.. What the.. but this room was soundproof.. so we couldn't hear Kisschasy. So, um, yeah, Steph went back to see KC, and I astayed in the room with about 4 other people, waiting for more to come in.. then Adam said it was like a sleepover, and everyone was like, COOL! and out of nowhere our bags appeared and we got into our jarmies and listened to Adam tell us about his foot... and it was so weird! Then I bumped into a guy, said 'sorry' made eye contact and it was the dangermoose!! OMG! So, we sat watching adam hills.. and then stephy wephy came and joined us and confused me with HPNick! What! lol, told you it was weird.. (For all the people who are even more confused.. - Nick lives in Sydney.. lol.. I'm in melb and stephy's usually in Bris... except for the 2 weeks of the year when she comes down here..) So yeah, that's my dream, I can't remember anymore.. Strange..... Anyway!

And Benjamin might even enjoy some of the stuff in it, believe it or not. :P And Jo, yep, my grandfather made a harpsichord. :) Luckily he didn't have deep conversations to Ben about anything. *phew* Next time. *nods* For sure.

Geeeez! Can you believe it's 2007? I can't. Wow. That year went so quick. What a lot of cliches.. *sigh* I'm going to try to lose more weight this year.. eat less junk.. focus on my tafe course.. and hopefully get my diploma. 

Hope you all had a nice new year! I did. Went to middo's place. The ultimate party location. :P Especially when his parents are in America! :P

Haha. Drinking was done. Minimal eating though. I had.. a strawberry vodka cruiser, a lime vc, smirnoff in a can, another vc I think.. then lemonade, then half a vodka shot with Jeff, ack.. so strong and burning.. then.. I can't remember. HAHA! Oh, wait, I had lemonade with raspberry syrup and bacardi. It was great.. I was quite dizzy/tipsy, but not to the point of throwing up or blacked out or anything, that's never happened to me. Thank god. :P

I need a job. I really do. Campion's still goin but finishes before Australia Day. I'm contemplating reapplying to Coles Group, and might go on seek.com, and I wouldn't mind working at the Comedy Festival this year, but what qualifications, if any would I need? :S Hmmm.. I've also got a list of photographers I may call to see if I can et any work with them.. Doubtful, but, you never know. I'm so glad I've left Tatts in The Pines. Grace was a bitch. So, a tip, don't work there. :)

I'm going to Apollo Bay the week we go back to tafe, YAY! haha, it's great. The people let me have a week off for that, so its all good. I'll go back the 2nd week. Poor lil Benny has to come back on the Sunday, he's having 4 teeth chiselled out of his jaw. Sucks to be you, ben ;) It's ok baby, I'll tease you lovingly closer to the date ;) Tee hee! Payback.

Ah well, Hope everyone here's well. And with jobs. I'll be happy while Campion job lasts. For Now. *sigh* Hmm.. *looks longingly out the window.. into the darkness..* Can't see shit...

I'm not very happy about jobhunting again though. Anyone know of any jobs going that aren't tattslotto? :D I'm sick of tatts. 

Hope everyone had a good christmas! I did. I drank a lot.. We went to my grandparent's place. There was only 5 of us this year... coz the rest of the family went to their other families... if that makes sense. I drank yummy strawberry champagne, midori and lemonade, more strawberry champagne, dessert wine, another midori and lemonade pre-mixed stuff when i got home.. and I think that was it.. I had a big headache the next morning. I think it's called a hangover. That's my first ever one. Awww! 

Boxing Day was good. Spent it with my boy. :-) I got lots of nice things for Christmas.. Santa gave me LITTLE BRITAIN DVD (Stephy!!!), a cow calendar, and some lovely celtic patterned earrings.. Mum and Dad gave me a cd rack, which is cool, I put it together myself.. and an awesome national geographic photography book :-) Grandparents gave me $100 :-) Ben gave me *clears throat* Ummm.. a jewellery holder thingy, which may also be used for coffee mugs... 'The Secret Life of Cows' book, a little cows statue-thingy. His parents gave me some cool black and white polka dot make-up bags, a graduation pic of benny, and a very annoying yet entertaining cow that moos 'deck the halls'.. Mum wanted to punch Libby (ben's mum) in the face... she's so mean. Ah well. I got Paris Hilton perfume from my godparents.. yes, that's right. Paris. Hilton. Perfume. It's not actually that bad. 

I think that's it. I gave myself Tripod's new CD ""Songs From Self-Saucing' and Adam Hills' new DVD. It rocks. :-)

Ummm.. went to the airport this evening to meet Lauren from our friendship groupy thingy, she came back from Germany today. She was Au Pairing there. :) Lucky thing. I'd love to do that in France... *ponders* 

Well, I should go, Ben and I are going Op Shop shopping tomorrow.. We're goin to LJ User River_frog's 21st. YAY! It's a 70s themed party.. :-) Yeah baby! Not sure who we're goin as though.. ah well, will find something.

Here ends the latest update on my life. :D xoxox oh, and apologies for spelling errors. I'm using Ben's keyboard, and it sucks. Bigtime."

Mum and Dad dropped me off at about 7.45pm, when we were sposed to be there at 8... I'm always so early! No one was there, duh. So we hung around some more, til about 8.25pm.. still no-one. So i txted Tomas.. he said he was on his way. Good. haha. then he came and so did Michelle and Lesley, from tafe. YAY! Was nice. Lots of people there too actually. Lots of signing and drinking.. was cool. I had 2 ciders. Yay! My throat hurt a lot afterwards.. :( Must've been the smoke..

Sunday went to my godparents' place for my godfather's 65th b'day. It was also his grand-daughter's 6th b'day. Aww! She's so cute. Her name's Amy. So that was fun.. Met Luke, my godparents'(Ron + Lila)< their daughter and son's (Lisa + Chris') 2nd cousin.. Man, confusing! He's from England.. he's 22, and he's a dork. But he's a nice dork. He's quite funny, and modest.. so, yeah.

I am goin to be working at Campion from Wednesday, 8.30 AM til 4.30 PM. Eeek! Will be kinda tired afterwards, but I'LL GET MORE MONEY! YAY! Should be good. Well, I dunno what'll happen with that moolah, coz it wasn't my boss lady who did it. Some poor (pardon the pun) person doesn't have their salary. I do. *sigh* Ah well. Will go to bank sometime. *nods* 

I went to the Zoo today with Luke (see above).. coz he 'wanted to ride the crocodiles..' Pity there's only two of them there, and they're called 'Phillipine Crocodiles'... but, yeah, he had this big long rant that he was gunna tell his mates back home he wrestled a croc in Melbourne.. *sigh* See. Dork. But was a fun day. Then we came back to the city, coz he lives in St Kilda. He's here for a year. Great. Haha. But we went to Young n Jacksons, had a drink, then went to Elephant & Wheelbarrow and had another drink, a pint, to be exact.. Mmm, 2 different ciders, had I. 1st was a sweet Mercury. Then Bulmers. Was nice! I wonder what my cider connoisseur has to say about that ;)You know who you are :P Hehehe. 7 ciders in 4 hours, eh? Hmm.. impressive.

Yay! Sarah's Animation Screening tomorrow night! That'll be cool! Seeing Benibles during the day tomorrow.. Wednesday - Campion, then nothing at night (can you believe it!?), might see my boy again, then Thursday - Campion and at night, LUCKSMITHS GIG! YAY! SO EXCITED! *dances* Friday, yeah, Campion.. then goin to see Justin Hammo and Tom Gleeson with the Charms at the G-Glitch Bar! Yay! (funny joke from the Umbilical Brothers dvd/show there if you geddit) ;-)

Then Saturday, Tattslotto work 2-6pm then Skarlette's 21st! WOOOOOOOOO! I bought funky clothes for the party. It's burlesque themed. Pity Ben can't come :P Tee hee! Will give you an update after it! ^_^ Wooo!

I'm thinking of quittin The Pines Tatts, if I'm not gettin anymore hours, and my boss woman won't trust me to close the shop, (and I don't blame her).. Where else can I go? I need a new job, apart from Campion, whom I may call tomorrow.. and hopefully get 2 months work there.. yay. Real hours. and real money. Sorta. Wouldn't mind a job at ComFest, that'd be kinda cool. Photography place would be nice too. Pixie Foto! I wanna do that. Hmm, ah well. Whatever.

Hmm, also scored a lot of money, checked my account last night, and have no idea why i have it there, I seriously don't earn that much. Will talk to stupid work people tomorrow or saturday. Maybe some knob just wrote out my account number instead of theirs.. wouldn't mind having said money, but.. I'm not keeping my hopes up. yet. Weird. SO very weird..

"event","YAY! For stuff. Not stubbing toes, coz that hurts. I did that this morning. My little toe, and the toe next to that toe hurts something bad. :'( Anyway, where was I? Saturday, drove back from Charm's place, voted, then worked. Watched DVDs by myself (Narnia-good movie). What else, yesterday had a nice little belated b'day picnicy thing at Edinburgh Gardens with Steph, Charms, Steve and Robyn. That was cool. Throwing of chicken and m 'n' m's and mango liquorice and bits of rolls occured. Hilarity! Steph also taught a dog called 'Bikki' to roll over. ROLL OVER! COME ON! ROLL OVER! .....
Then went to the carnival next to the park, wasn't too bad.. steph and robyn bought these containers of strawberries with marshmallows and choc bits and cream, which was nice, and THEN went over to the 'Mr Whippy' van, (actually, it wasn't called a 'Mr Whippy Van', it was unnamed) and the icecream man put vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce and sprinkles ON TOP OF THE STRAWBERRIES/MARSHMALLOWS/CHOC BITS AND CREAM! Rock. Funny! Then then people gave me the opportunity to choose what we could do. I chose to go to Robyn's house. As I didn't know where Deer Park was, I in for a bit of a surprise... well, it's past the Zoo, through the city, onto the western ring road, over the bolte bridge, over the westgate bridge and nearly to Bendigo. YAY! hahaha. It was a nice drive though. We got there and I was low on fuel, so i went n got some more fuel. Good idea, eh? We watched 2 dvds.. 'Men With Brooms', which I fell asleep through.. and then 'Dodgeball', which I stayed awake for coz I own it and i like it... haha. We had carbonara for dinner, which was nummy, thanks Robyn! We also played with glow sticks, Steph's Ipod and I think that's it. So yeah, was nice. I drove robyn and charms there, and stephy and charms back. I even let Stephy drive back to Bec's place, coz that's where she's staying.. I was petrified. nah, just kidding, she wasn't /that/ bad. TONIGHT WE'RE PLAYING POOL! YAY! Shall be fun.. then stephy goes home tomorrow! YAY! I mean... AWW! NO! NO! STAY! STAAAAAAAAAY! Staaaaaaaaaay.... ROLL OVER!"

"event","Supergig last night! Gorskys. The Drowning Hitlers and Man Bites God. IT Rocked. A lot!! I got lots of nice pix and vids.. yay! It was so much fun!!! I drank lots! Occasionally lost my balance too! Go me! Hilarity. Gorksys were up first. YAY! Did you know, these bands hadn't performed for like, 7 years?!?! ""I like fish"" was a big crowd favourite. I love that song. I wanted to get the EP, but if I bought it, as well as TDH's album, I'd be much poorer than I am now.. Then MBG were up. I took lotsa videos and pics, hipefully they'll be on the site soon! *crosses fingers* :P
Then The Drowning Hitlers. YEAH! They rocked bigtime too. I like ""The Puppy Song"" the best (sung by Marisa of Duckdive. Wheee!), and also like ""Little Moth"".. The lyrics = clever. After the gig, we hung round the Spanish Club for a bit, drank some more. I scored a free Bourbon and Coke (my 3rd or 4th drink, I can't remember..) from Chris' free tickety thing. Rock. Then got kicked out. Stood on the street with Becs, Stephy, Sarah, GM, Steve, Sheryl, Tegan, Jules, Charms.. and just talked and laughed a lot. :) That was nice. But i needed to go to the toilet. Friggin. Anywho, waited HOURS for the BAND MEMBERS.. who took forever packing up, which is fair enough, as they had lots of stuff! Then we walked to Brunswick St, which wasn't far away, as I realised in my drunken stupor.. ""HEY! I KNOW WHERE WE ARE!"" *sigh* I remember that. We went to Cue Bar, played pool, watched Geeky Tomkins play Space Invaders, Beccers played pinball, and Robyn played Pacman, kicked arses, got own arses kicked.. Was fair I think. Left there about 3:30 am ish. Then went to souvlaki/fish n chip/pizza shop. I didn't have anything.. Wasn't really hungry. Bit sleepy though. Then Chris, James, Robyn and Sarah went one way and Becs, Stephy, Charms et moi went the other.. B & S crossed the road towards B's house, n C & Me walked down Alexandra Pde to Charm's place, where I was staying. We talked about Neighbours.. IT WAS GREAT! I was in my element. Jesse Spencer?!? HAHA! Only Charms and Stephy and Becs will get that. Wow, I've written shitloads! Anyway, got back to Charms' at 4am. 4 AM! It was a friggin awesome night/morning!

Voted today. Not exciting. So won't write about it. HA! Take that Bracksy and Baillieu! Nah, I want free transport.. DAMMIT! Libs better win. *sigh*"

"event","Ok, so, is it normal to sit on the couch by oneself, eat chocoalte, drink 1 and a bit bottles of cider and watch girly movies and cry? I hope so. :-)
Good. Coz I've just watched the movie 'Crazy/Beautiful' and it made me cry. Kirsten Dunst movie. Was great! :) I went out after dinner and got some dvds. Just coz I can, and mum gave me 'emergency money', and these.. were an emergency. I was alone, and needed entertaining. problem solved. Oh yeah, the chocolate was an emergency also... :D

Mum n Dad went up to Healesville for one of their golf/shopping weekends with their gang of friends. Quite nice really. Means I have the house to myself for a few days. :) Yay.

Well, last night was fun. Ben and I went to Bridie O'Reilly's in Chapel St for Geff's belated birthday celebrations. Was nice. :)Was good to catch up with people, spesh you, Marie! Haha, we were signing to each other, with everyone watching us, going, ""What are you saying?"" ""Eh?"" ""What's that mean?"" ""Is she deaf?"" It was friggin hilarious. Porter got pissed off. Sucks to be him. Coz he's a knob. Haha! *ahem* I had a cider (surprise surprise)and a QF. Mmmm.. shots are good. Expensive, but good. That cost me $6. Strongbows was $6.80.. *sigh* So THAT'S why I don't have any money! Oh, and the fact that I only work 4 hours a week. Grrr. I only have $20 in my savings account atm. Crap. Hmm, how many times have I blabbed on about that 4 hour work thing? A lot. Yeah. I thought so. DO you know, I've applied to Starbucks, Hudsons, ColesMyer again, and just recently a Digital Studio Photographer Assistant?! I have heard SQUAT from them. Nothin. Not a pickle! Meh.

On Friday I went out with Stephy! (LJ user: cool_boof)Wooo! Stephy's down from Brisvegas. I laughed when she told me she arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday wearing a tshirt and shorts. HAHA! So funny. Well, what do you expect, girl :P Hehehe. Anyway, we met in the city and had PIES! yay! (Coz those brisvegas chickies are sadly deprived of Jesters Pies. Can you believe it?!?) We wandered aimlessly round the city, bought.. what was it.. an iced skinny gingerbread latte.. Mmm.. and stephy got a Boost juice... an energiser juice to be exact. and then we wandered some more, looked round JB HIFI for a while, stephy played a PSP.. and then we walked up swanston st and got ICECREAM from Trampoline. :) It was so good. Well, there goes my dieting plans. Whoops. Nah, just kidding. 'Twas fun!

I go to the gym in Mitcham (Contours), twice a week, maybe even more soon. :) It's cool. It's a circut (is that right sp? it doesn't look right..) um, yeah, so i go round twice, it's only for 30 mins, which is cool. This time next year i'll be skinny! Hopefully! *sigh*

Man I can talk crap can't I?! ""Yeah"" you say, ""but I read it.."" Wow, what a lovely friend you are! :D 

Here I am, listening to lovely Lucksmiths/Guild League Songs, I love Tali's voice.. it's so pure.. and awesome! I wanna go to their gig, (Luckies gig) Dec 7. Hoping I have money by then.. Reeeeeeeeeeealllly wanna go..

Hmm, I should do some homework. It's due Monday, and I'm pretty busy tomorrow.. all day. It's a tough life.. but what I'm doing isn't schoolwork or work related, so yay! Fun-ness :D 

Trying to do homework.. drinking cider.. distracted by nice funky Tali songs and various websites... hey, that reminds me.. I'm on YouTube.com! Go there, and type in 'DJIntegr8' <--- that's Brendan :) Yay! Thanks Brez. You rock. :) 

Anyway, my eyelids are gettin heavy, so I might go now. Thanks for reading this. You're dedicated. :) I bet some people, like Ben, :P just skipped through it. Haha. Or not. Night guys n gals! :D

As you can probably tell, it wasn't really the *best* birthday.. I went to my Aunty and Uncle's for Melbourne Cup Day on tuesday, my horse won shit all, room full of people i didn't know. 
That night I went to my friends 21st Masquarade party. Ok, that was alright. ;) It really didn't really feel like my birthday at all. I felt out of place. Non-existant to say the least. It was so weird. 
We (Uncle, Aunty, Mum, Dad, Ben and Me) went out to dinner on Sunday night, which was nice. 
I can't complain about a 5 day weekend. Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues and Wed. Nice. No homework either, which is good, but bad, as i should've done some report thingy, i briefly blabbed on, but isn't that what you're supposed to do? 
May have a party soon. Or various gatherings of some kind. Hopefully with people I know, and not various older friends of my Aunt and Uncle who I don't know.. *sigh* 
I'm kinda excited about tomorrow night.. goin to see David Strassman with Benny. Should be good. That was a pressie from Mum n Dad. As well as a gym membership. Huzzah. I can't stand my stupid mother going on and on about how i need to lose weight. I know I have to, but geez, over and over?! Bit too much? 
Hmm, in a weird mood tonight. Might be my new found 'sophisticated' personality shining through. No idea. Oh and if you want, you can come to this... I'm doin an acappella performance this Monday night, the 13th:

- about 7.45pm, Tali keeps changing the time.. :P
- 'Journal' in Flinders Lane
- We will sound awesome.. ;-) 

I also need a job. Maybe something in the comedy/com-fest for next year area, sign language, coffee shop, photography.... just friggin something that gets me more than only 4 hours on a saturday???  

Went to an interview for Cert 3 in Childrens Services, the chicky stopped it 1/2 way though, said they need someone for next year, which wasn't me, coz i'd be tafe-ing... so maybe in 2008.. Ahh.. job seraching is crap. :'(

Groove is in the Heart by Deelite, a combo song of 'It's a Wonderful World/Beautiful Day/Amazing Grace'... by various people.. and only been done ONCE in the entire world! Rock.

*snigger* Such a dork. At the start of our class last night, we'd changed classrooms, me, not being the smartest, or, 'not the sharpest knife in the drawer', as Ben puts it.. I went to the Degraves St CAE Level 5 instead of the Flinders Lane CAE Level 5. Duh. Anyway, we were warming up.. and doin this kinda 'hum' thing and Tali said, ""Hmm, the Exel Students in the other room'll be gettin annoyed... *in a slightly gay voice* ""What's wrongwith my computer.....!!"" *mimes bashing a computer on its side* It was so funny.

Go and see it at the Czech Club, 497 Queensberry Street.. North Melbourne. Only 1 show of his left! FRIDAY THE 13TH OF OCTOBER. OoOoOoO! GO. You won't regret it. Honest. It rocked my socks off. He signed my Rubik's Cube. Yes. I am a comedy groupie geek. *sigh* But it's cool. I dig all the comedians. ^_^ and they dig me. I think.

Long time no post! Hmm, Sept 16th, what's been happenin these past few days?

Went to Robyn's Picnic thingy at the Ed Gardens on the 17th. That was lovely.. til it started raining, so we all went to Sarah's.. which was lovely... til James came. Nah, only kidding. It was alright... til he started talking about opening a Strip Club, called 'Bucket-O-Skin'.. Well, speaking of that, he actually got us started on this huge pun-related fruit shop thing. Go check out the LJ. I can't believe James actually posted it. On the day, he wrote each pun down. In a little book. :-| Ah well, it was pretty good fun. But it still continues til this day. 

Anyway - Holidays! Yay! Last week... I'm trying to remember what I did.. It was enjoyable. I think. 
Wednesday - went to the Dentist. My Uncle. Woo! I also caught up with zee Dangermoose.. 
Thursday - Ben and I went to Skaska's gig, yay! That rocked, apart from the fact I was the ONLY one from Tafe there! :-| Then me and the Benibles went to a nice restaurant for dinner :)
Friday - worked 5.30pm til 9pm. Then went to katie and ben's party. That was good fun :) 
Worked Sat. Benjamin stayed with us for a few days, (thurs-sun) since his floor at home got polished. Yay! That was nice :) 
Sunday - bummed around for a bit, went to Eastland, present shopping..  hehe, fake fish.. then later that night went to Claire's (from ben's work) party, which was.. ok.. I guess.. *smiles* Um, yeah. 
and yesterday - went to the Show! Wooo! I got the Wonka showbag (as I do every year) and the new showgrounds are so different! Saw Dylan Lewis live on the air at the Nova tent, that was cool. Harley Breen was also there. :) 
Worked at Campion today, also doing so tomorrow, and Thursday. I should do some homework. Holidays aren't for doin homework! They're for relaxing! Grr!
Benny's b'day on Friday! yay! party. rawk. So, that's everything. For now.

Til next time, Maddie xoxox

p.s - I've had that song, 'More Than Words' by Extreme, in my head for the past couple of days. It's a good song, I think it'd sound cool as acappella.. *squees*"

My feet are sore from standing all day.

Went to Sarah's party last night! It was very cool. Lots of people there. Lovely humourous photos as always! Might post em on flickr account soon. If I can be bothered! Anywho.. what happened last night? I had 3, yeah, count em, 3 CIDERS! I am the CIDER queeeeeeen! Well, nah, not really. I was dizzy though. Had to hold onto Ben for most of the night. 

Oooh, I got approx 153 funky photos back from Big W yesterday, (cost me $38.50-ish) they're all really good, even if I say so myself ;) hehe. Photos from lots of different events. Parties, Gigs, more parties, Auslan Excursions.. :-)

Hmmm, tafe is finished for another term. WOOO! 2 weeks off! That means more sleep ins! *dances* although, i think I should consider exercise, as i feel like I'm gaining weight, I don't know why. Damn you food. *Shakes fist at all things yummy* More walkings with the wuppy puppy. 

*nods* Hmmm.. I bought a nice funky jackety top thing the other day from Jay Jays, it was cheap ($10!!!!) and looks cool.. It's brown with red n pink-ish stripes on it. It's a guy's top, but it fits me pretty well, I like it... Now all I need is a group of people, snow, and skis. Hmmm, *scratches head* Don't think it's that time of year.... Anyone wanna shout me a ticket to Canada? *smiles sweetly* :D 

Well, I must go off now and make cookies. *winks at Stephy* ;-) hehehe. Fun day out tomorrow, at a park! Garden! place! :-) *dances*

p.s- ... Acappella Course with Tali White... October 9th... Flinders St. Eeeeeeee! Every time I think about it I go all excitable. WOOOOO!

I am so very.. very.. tried. tredi. I mean, tired. See. My spelling even shows it.. 

Well, wouldn't you all like to know what I've been up to? No? well I'm gunna tell youse anyways. 
Worked 8 hours last Saturday. Fun. Yaaaay! Monies! 
Sunday went to Mt Eliza for Father's/Pa's Day and Granny's birthday.. Monday, Tafe.. was home by myself, Mum went to Geelong and Dad went to Townsville..
Tuesday, Tafe and went to Warrandyte for walk with zee pup.. Went to benny's for dinner. Mmmm, risotto. It was so good, Ben's Dad, Ben and myself had to fight it out in the kitchen who got the last 2nds. <--- haha, the last 2nds. Oooh, philisophical. 
*ahem* Um, yeah. Today, DAY OFF! WOOO! Slept til 12.30pm, I know, I'm a slob. 

I then went to Eastland, bought food for dinner (made yummy Broccoli and Potato Au Gratin.. Mmmm..), walked around Eastland, ate sushi.. (Mmmm..) got paid (Mmmm...) from the last few shifts at Box Hill.. *dances* What else.. Recharged phone.. bought fabric.. went home, made a blue flanelette (sp?) dwarf hat.. for a party on Sat. I went through so many characters I could go as, then thought, Meh, I'll go as a Dwarf. Boring. But I need a name. Anything in mind people? Not your average Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey... I want something unique! ;)

So yeah, finished that damn hat, aboot 11pm tonight. Phew. my thumb's covered in pin pricks. looks good that hat though. can't see the pin pricks though. they don't hurt either. yay! I'm invincible! So yeah. Wow, look at my rant. So long.... very.. long.. and it keeps gettin longer..

It's still at a Tattslotto, but not at Box Hill anymore.. It's at The Pines! Woooo! They said they'd give me 4-ish permanent shifts, thursday nights, friday nights, saturday all day and then sundays a bit later on, they're moving to the new part of the shopping centre.. I think.

The Pines Tatts also is a Darrell Lea choc shop! WOOOO! :-D

So wooooo! So my last shift at Box Hill is on Wednesday. Kinda happy, but I think I'll miss the friendly customers...
Hopefully they might come to The Pines once in a while.. *crosses fingers*

I've also got a few days at Campion during the hols. Yay!

I can actually save up for a car! Hurray! So happy :) and I start this new job Saturday! *dances*

Edit: 10.30pm. Forgot to mention - I went to Tripod with Jo & Sarah on Thursday night! I met Tegan, Beth and Charms there. The line was so friggin long. Was friggin great though! I got heaps of friggin pictures! Yay! Lots of fun. Friggin awesome fun. :-)
Friday was Jane's party. That was pretty cool catching up with peeps again. Saw Sarah today, she visited me at work. 3 days in a row! She can't keep away from me! LOL.
I have a strange desire to drive to a friend's place this minute and stay there the night.. Weird. Can't drive though, I had a bottle of CIDER before! Mmmmm.. drive. I mean, Cider. Mmmm.. cider. or, Cyder! HAHA! *sigh* Der. <--- geddit?"

"event","Wow, there's been so much happening recently i haven't had time to post!

Let's see... I've been to 3 of the Man Bites God Plan B Bar residencies... they rocked my socks off! Lotsa fun. And believe it or not, got LOTS of pictures! Last Friday, went with Ben, Jen, Anthony and met Jean n Kabel there. Had THREE ciders (stephy, proud of me?!) n got a bit 'tipsy' to say the least. ;)
Unfortunately not going to the 4th gig, got a friend's party on. 
Gah, but.. yay kinda also. 

Yo, Chras, Jimes and Mork - Good luck for gig number 4 guys! I'm sure it'll go well, since you rock n all that. GO CAKE HAT GO!
Oh, and um, people who go to zee gig, tell me how it goes n such. Ta! :D

My favourite apples are Braeburn. <---- random-ness is great.

What else has been goin on? I've been to parties.. yay for parties! And dinners out.. for birthdays.. got 4 more parties coming up! All within our big group of friends too!

I went to lovely Sarah's animation screening last Thursday, which was awesome! nice work Miss Phillips! ^_^ 

I've been asked by the nice Campion (textbook shop/warehouse) man, Gary, if I can work during the holidays.. yay! more money!

I've also been asked to housesit for our friend Kendra.. and to look after her puppies while they're away... hopefully doin that.

Seen mah boy a lot, yay for that! *huggles him* 

Maaybe goin to see Tripod this Thursday... really want to... see what happens.. I get paid on Wednesday! Woo!

That's really all at the mo, trying to find another job.. to juggle with the one i have now.. photo shops, pets paradise type shops, coffee shops.. trying to stay away from food-y shops, like bakeries.. I don't want to put on *more* weight.. :-| 

Friends and rellies have inspired me to sing more and play a new instrument, like zee bass geetar. I've had a twiddle on my cuz's bass, I think I might go n get a 'Bass Guitar for Dummies' book. Whatcha think? Only thing is, the strings are hard on my lil fingees. :( and plus I sweat all over the neck of the bass.. is that rockstar or what!?

I also had an idea of doing an Acappella course at the CAE soon, but if I do it in October, it'll clash with my new course within my Auslan course, Audiology, Monday nights... maybe I'll do it next term, or in the holidays. I have so many goals and aspirirations, which I can presume that is a good thing.. although I'm finding it hard to make time for them! 

HAHA, oooh, another thing I'm thinking of doing is taking up a new sport.. a Martial Arts of some kind, one that's kinda self-defence, but relaxing also. and Ben, I don't want that one that enables you to kill someone in 3 strikes, that ain't for me, k? :P

I can never seem to class my journal entries as 'short', can I?!
Have a nice few days/weeks/months.. til whenever I speak/type to you again! Feel free to comment too, comments are nice and lovely!

"event","Hey all, how are you? I haven't posted since the end of June, how bad is that...

What's been goin on? With me.. well, I went on a resume run today to 3 different shopping centres.. The Pines, Eastland and Westfield Shoppingtown, Doncaster. Wooo. I printed out 35, and when I got home had 20 left, wasn't /that/ bad.. Lots of people accepted my CV, which was good, and no-one rejected it.. handed it out to heaps of places, mainly photo places, and pets paradise, told them I was allergic to rabbits and cats, and one of the girls said, that's ok, me too... it was great.
I went to bookshops, homewares shops, called into see Josie at National Geographic, gave one to her, she put a smiley face on it :D yay! So.. yeah. Crossing fingers and hoping for the best. 

I'm trying to find a new job as you probably noticed. My boss is crap. she told me I'm a chicken and that I need to go back to kindergarten because apparently I can't count money. Biatch. So, I want out.. But enough of that.

On Saturday went to Brendan's 20th party, that was cool. Let's see.. Pete ate a gigantic chip, Tony was late, a little white dog ran into Brendan's backyard and got attacked by Jackson, his dog, many an episode of Top Gear was watched, as was 'Hard Gay', a Japanese show on TV, which was quite bizarre. Ben almost embraced Tony, thinking it was me... that was hilarious.. apparently we 'traded places' and when Ben turned around he put his hands on Tony's hips.. haha, hilarity. The problem was, Tony and myself were wearing the same colour.. and Ben saw it from his peripheral vision. HAHAAHA! Anyway, that was funny. 

Ben's being crap, he was just singing 'If you're retarded and you know it clap your hands....' and... I.. clapped.. coz I didn't hear what he was singing, coz he mumbles when he sings. Now he's teasing me about it, and it's annoying! Now he's hugging me... what is this... Damn you Ben, I'll get you back later :-|

Anyways, gunna watch 'Envy' with Ben now, Ben Stiller and Jack Black movie, go see it, it's great :-)

See ya round everyone! -Maddie ^_^"

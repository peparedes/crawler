"event","Okay so I was looking on the website www.jwpepper.com just looking at some jazz music for some ideas to pass on to Mrs. Falhgren for Vocal Jazz this year. Well...I stumbled on two pieces that I fell madly in love with! Voicedance and Voicedance 2 composed by Greg Jespeser! Go to that website and click on the link that says Jazz Music on the right, then click on Vocal Jazz, next under navigate click on V and you will find those songs. If you have real player you can listen to them!

I wanted to post this so people could hear them! These songs are just too precious to keep hidden!! Please go listen they are wonderful!"

"event","OMG Drama Club was packed yesterday! I believe we counted over 35 people...isn't that crazy for the very first meeting of the year. I was thinking that there wouldn't be that many people being it only the thrid day of school but I walked in and there were more than about 5 people so I was like yay at least some came...then about 5 minutes later I turn around from talking to someone in the front and almost every table...mind you there are about 8 tables...had about 2 people. By the end there was up to three people at almost every table and there were even some on the couch. Can you believe that!!! 

This year has started great! I thought being a senior would be awesome but no it has been fantastic! All my classes are much more mature...well the theachers. They treat us like we are adults not high schoolers. We talk about real life things, like drugs or drinking...not talking about them like the teachers do it but they joke around with us in that sense. I just love it and it's so much fun! In my pysch class we talk about personal things and there isn't so much reading and all that but we talk about ourselves and try to get to know other people in the class. I can't wait for more...I'm actually excited for school!

Seniorism Rocks!!!"

So I saw tons of people I haven't seen in forever today! Oh my way to Starbucks I saw Maddie in her car...then of course I saw tons of people at school...then Elinor and I go to Petsmart and on our way there we see Brendy in her car at a stop light! It was amazing! That was a lot of fun! I miss her! :( Anyways...then in Petsmart we are getting crickets and Kelean walks up...don't know if I spelled it right. Well Katie knows him...it's like her bestest guy friend ever! I only met him once but he was pretty badass to hang out with! 

I love these days when you just run into EVERYONE!!! Well I must go off to have my beauty sleep...I need it...

"event","Do you ever have those days when everything around you seems sad...and you just want to cry? Well today is like that. 

Yesterday I had a great time with Katie seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and going to the first Drama officers meeting of the year today. 

But for some reason when i got home I felt kind of sad. I think it was because I saw the gate from Rue Plumet and the barricade today at Riverside. I miss that show alot. Some people don't understand. When you are with the same people for 6 weeks, 5 days a week, 5-6 hours a day you get attached. Also has I was going through my music today on my computer I found Casper's Lullaby that I downloaded a while ago. It's so sad, every time I listen to it I just want to burst into tears. Then to top it all off, I know this will be kind of stupid but, I was on the site fanfiction.net and I was looking through some of the stories they have on there and I came across a really sad one and once again I almost cried.

I should be happy...school is starting, I'm basically over him, and I just want to start off new. But for some reason there is a little sad demon in me that won't go away. When ever I get happy he comes in and stomps on that happy bubble and pops it. I just want that demon to go away..."

Thank you to every who is so helpful I just love all of you.

Well while I was in Idaho we went to Silverwood (not worth it!!!) I love roller coasters but it was so hard to have fun. Randomly I would see couples hand in hand or holding each other and I just hate knowing that that is gone. I love that part of relationships where you just cuddle or be by their side! Also it's like this little black rain cloud would come over me at times. I'll be fine not thinking about him but then all of a sudden memories and this picture of them together would pop up. I hate it because everything around me seems so...blah... I just want to get over it but for the next few days I am by myself so I will have nothing to do but think. I love to be by myself but right now I don't want to think. I just want to do...

All I want is that feeling back. That feeling of being loved and loving someone else and just being with a person that makes you feel beautiful.

I didn't want to be with a guy that would even think about doing that to a girl, who they say they love. Of course I cried and it was hard but I just can't be with him and picture him with her while I'm with him...that would be to hard. Maybe sometime in the future I can forgive them but right now it hurts to much. 

And on top of that today I get a call from my father blaming me for not telling him sooner that I was off to Idaho. My mom didn't want me to tell him yet so I didn't. For twenty minutes he talked about me never calling him and if I truly loved him then I would show it. Then he mentioned a counsular (?) and I said I wouldn't go but he said that he could force me to go if he wanted me too.

I have never had such a horrible day in my life. My boyfriend cheats on me and we break up and my father puts all this pressure and blame on me for him not being a good father.

I don't want to face the world right now. I just want to lie in a corner and cry....

But life must go on...i have to work in one hour. I just want the pain in my heart to stop....I want my tears to go away...I want to be happy....."

"event","So senior year is about to begin ladies and gentlemen! Please keep your hands and feet in the vehicle at all times!!!

Oh I can't wait! Senior is going to kick ass and I want it to start then end so I can go to college. Today I went to Raven Days and got my schedule. It was all screwed up though. I signed up for Creative Writing and Shakespeare but neither was on my schedule. So I went to change it and found that both classes were 1st period either semester...I have Advanced Choir that period. I was pissed. But instead of either of those they stuck me in Socitey of the Future...no fucking way am I going to take a class about sci-fi shit that I didn't sign up for. But I got it changed so instead of Independent Living I'm taking Indivdualized Reading 3rd and Nutrition and Wellness 6th (Second Semester). I'm happy with my schedule now, but I still wish I have Creative writing and Shakespeare. Oh and another thing I don't have a fucking top locker. They issued all the senior lockers out. That's total crap! Elinor and I wanted a locker next to each other and the only way we could with both top lockers was in the freashman section in the 800 hall...no way am I being surrounded by freshies my Senior year. So I gave it up and got a bottom locker (below Elinor) in the 700 hall. I like where it is and I guess I can live with the bottom. 

Anyways enough complaining. Today was such a random day with Elinor. Here I will take you on a little tour. We go to Raven days and go through all this crap and meet people we havn't seen in months, then we head up to Starbucks and sit and talk for a while and again meet people we havn't seen in months. Then we head over to my house and grap her book and check our myspaces. Then we head down back to the school to return her book that she had a fine on. We sit at her house for 20 minutes talking and all of a sudden she wants taco bell and I said I wanted ice cream so we head over to Fred Meyer get a pint of Ben and Jerrys and go to Taco Bell where she orders food and I sit there with metal spoon we brought from her house and eat my ice cream. Then on the way back to her house she spots Pay Less and we head inside to look at shoes. Winging it I buy a pair of shoes and right before we leave she spots the most cutest and comfortable shoes ever and we both buy a pair, her green and me pink. So we go back to her house and chat it up with her mom and she shows us a jacket she bought. Then we sit on her stairs and watch her mother change the lap shades in their family room. So now here I am sitting on my computer after a completly random day that just made me happy!

Who doesn't love the random things in life! I love them!!

So Les Mis is over...very sad. I will miss many people and the actually show. I can't wait for the pictures and dvd to get here. I want to look at them and watch it so bad! I miss everything now...even though it was over two days ago! I can't wait to audition for Dandilion Wine in the fall!!

Well I have been doing a show so far this summer and it has been one of the best experiences I have had in a long time. And this is my tenth show, and I got a lead for the first time in a musical, but second lead in theater all together! We had our first weekend go great! It was so much fun and I am still having that rush of excitement! I just love acting so much I could be on a stage my entire life and never get tired of it! 

This summer has taught me so much and I don't want it to end. Well I would love to start my senior year but I have had to much fun with everyone in the cast (well some of them) and Thaddeus. Oh if you havnt heard already I have a boyfriend! He is so wonderful and I love being with him. When I am with him he respects me by saying wonderful things, opening my door for me, and just being great! I have never felt beautiful before in my life and that's how I feel around him. I don't care that he is 1 year and some months younger than me. Age is just a number and has nothing to do with relationships. I love being with him and there is nothing that parents or friends or anyone for that matter say that will make me not want to be with him. Plus he is a magnificent kisser! :)

Well I better go and get my schedule changed for work! I love you all! :)"

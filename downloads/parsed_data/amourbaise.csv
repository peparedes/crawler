"event","So I haven't really posted in a while. But here I am.
It's spring break. FINALLY. It's so incredible. I haven't been hanging out with any of my Highland Hall friends though. Which is kind of a good thing in a way. They're a little boring. It's pretty much been LACHSA and Oakwood for me these past few days...Diana has practically been living with me, I haven't gone more than a day without seeing her. We're practically the same person. Scarrryyyyy.
Anyway.
Life is brilliant. I'm so happy. And I'm about to experience something that is going to change my life...
I'm excited.

It's just a simple line
I can still hear it all of the time 
If I can just hold on tonight 
I know that nothing 
Nothing survives 
Nothing survives 
I think i'm turned around 
I'm looking up 
Not looking down 
And when I'm standing still 
Watching you run 
Watching you fall 
Fall into me 

Am I making something worthwhile out of this place 
Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase 
I am displaced 
I am displaced 

And she's my friend of all friends 
She's still here when everyone's gone 
She doesn't have to say a thing 
We'll just keep laughing all night long 
All night long 

Am I am making something worthwhile out of this place

No one survives

"event","Adolescence.
The simple joys of childhoood; the innocence, the laughter, the carelessness, everything. It's all fading away too quickly. There's nothing we can do to stop it. Believe me, if there was, I would have found it by now and used it to block the hurl of adulthood...it's running towards me at a pace that seems faster than the fucking speed of light.
I don't know what to do.
I'm not ready for this.
But then again, I am. I want to move on. I want to grow up, to evolve, to experience. 
But I'm so afraid. What if it all ends too quickly?
What if I decide to experience it and it ends up hurting me?
What will I do then? What if my life doesn't end up the way I want it to?
Then what?
Where do I go from there?

I wish there was an answer"

Have you ever had a moment/s where you just feel like you're going to explode from happiness? Where you dance alone in your room blasting CASCADA and don't care who knows it? Where EVERYTHING just seems to be going your way? THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS.

In fact, this is one of those MONTHS. It just keeps getting better. Wowowweewa.
I have never been so happy.
I hope, hope, HOPE it lasts. So very much.
And the good thing is...I definitely have faith that it will. 

Definitely.

I hope that if you don't feel the same that you can achieve my level of happiness soon. It feels great. Everyone deserves to be happy =)"

"event","My mono is dissapearing! Thank god.
Well.
My day was quite nice. Although I had to wake up at 10 (which is unusually early for me seeing as I've been sleeping until around 1:30-2ish) to see Caits out the door and go to the doctor, it ended up being the best day I've had all week. I got to go in the car, which I haven't done for a while, and see the world! AHHHH. It was so nice to be out. 
After a very pleasing trip to Dr. Kayne's office in which I found out my mono was going away, I went to Robertson with my mom and did some well deserved (in my opinion) shopping. American Apparel, Kitson, Madison, etc...it was a fabulous day. The drive home was great too; me and my mom discussed architecture and music (how sophisticated) and stopped for In N' Out. (Although I must admit, a few nasty drivers in the Coldwater Canyon traffic put a damper on my afternoon = /)
But all in all it was a great day. 
Another piece of incredible news: I'm going to semi-formal on friday!! YES. I'm so happy I could pee myself. I hope it's as good as I want it going to be. 

Life is looking up. Hopefull it will stay as is.

"event","And I'm still in the same mood. I still have the same thoughts. And I still want to kill the same people. =/
You know, if I wasn't me, I would be really afraid of myself. 
But whatever. 

I've come to a new realization. (Which probably won't last long, but for now, it's keeping me level)
Life is too short. Sure, it's not that original, but it's pure. And it makes a lot of sense. To spend my time worrying about what people think of me and worrying about what I'm gonna wear and how I look and things like that is <b>totally</b> pointless. Its like Laura's wall says: I am a strong beautiful woman, openly sharing my love with you.
I am who I am. And if you don't like it, I really don't care. =]

Goodnight lovers"

"event","Movies have never been that interesting to me. I mean, I grew up among several film-makers, so quite obviously, it bores me. But lately I've been watching a lot of great films, most of which have not been highly recognized by society. Indie films, to say the least. It's so great how an introduction to something you've never experienced before leads to a new excitement. 

     On another note, I'm totally fucked. This sickness could NOT have come at a worst time. I was really looking forward to my friday night, especially since there were people I wanted to see really, really badly. But now I am confined to my bed for the rest of the week, without attachment to the real world, thinking about how all of my plans are RUINED, and boring myself on Livejournal. Writing pointless entries and playing on the internet. I hate shit like this."

It's so funny how music can depict EXACTLY how you feel.

"event","So I'm home sick, laying in bed and thinking about how <i>horrible</i> my luck is. There are so many things I could've done during my amazing February break...but no. Now I have mono. And I'm going to murder someone. 
Not to mention I have a 7 page paper due today that I'm unable to turn in because I'm confined to my bed (which, I might add, is getting less and less comfortable by the minute). 
Someone please come to my house and cheer me up. 
But if you do, remember that you have to sit at the other side of the room so that I don't infect you.
Okay.
Much love."

"event","Livejournal brings back intense fucking memories.
It's hilarious.

So today has been quite eventful. Starting with my fortuitous realization that I have a giant final tomorrow, moving onto experiencing the aftermath of Valentine's Day...everyone being all lovey dovey and annoying. And then, to top it off, I had a MOST awful trip to the doctor's where I found out that, yes, I have mono, and no, I will not be attending my formal on friday. =]

Oh, life and the lemons it throws at you.
This week has been terrible. Thank god it's Friday tomorrow. Even though I probably won't be going to school...or anything else for that matter.

"event","Today is Wensday and it really sucks because i keep thinking its thursday and that we have a half day tomorrow. Nothing new happend today in school except we had a sub in spanish and we NEVER have a sub because the guy like lives there! In art were doing photo shop and thats so easy and i love itt<3 We only had practice till 3:50 today..we had a party for christina and lauras birthday.  I was kinda happy because i got to go home earlier but i like my 5:30 bus because the people on it are really funny. We stole one of christinas cup cakes because she stupidly left them sitting on the bench in the locker room..that is sooo stupid because the people on my team are like FOOOD  ahahaha. So bri took one and put it in my locker because we were gunna be late for practice so when it was over i took it and put it all over her facee 8-) haha. So she ran after me all around the locker room until i got trapped in the bathroom and then she put it all over my face!! like ten times worse then what i did to her! so that wasnt fun ahaha. But what really made my day was when kaitlin was running in the locker room and fell right on her butt. It was the funniest thing ever!! and only kaitlin would still run after ms.P said that we will crack our heads open if we keep running so kaitlin just went and proved her point ahaha.

Nicole made my day like 10x better=] because she pointed out that i have issues with boys lol butttt it helped me realize stuff so i love herr very muchh <3"

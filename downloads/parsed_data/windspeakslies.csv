incubus-take me to your leader
What if your brain, 
unexpectedly and suddenly, 
picked out things to flip around 
and view a lot differently? 
What if blue sky, 
all of a sudden turned a purple hue? 
We would shit a brick the size of all of it... 
what if? 
What if I was just daydreaming? 
What if I lived in a pear? 
What if my watch read 4:20 every hour, every day? 
You can bet your dollar I'd be happy! 
I forgot to remember; 
I forgot to remember my pain. 
Take me to your leader 
or die by the fly guy! 
What if mothballs, 
hangin' around too close to microwaves 
suddenly woke up and said, 
""Take me to your leader 
or die by fly guy! 
He'll push ya' out, 
no wings attached!"" 
Just do as I say, no mistake, 
he'll blow away. 
What if I was daydreaming? 
What if I lived in a pear? 
What if I had a mustard drenched cucumber 
tied to my leg and I 
did not want my pants to get dirty? 
What if this, what if that?! 
Go! I forgot to remember; 
I forgot to remember my pain. 
Take me to your leader 
or die by the fly guy! 
I forgot to remember my...PAIN! 
My pain! 
Forgot to inject my...cocaine! 
Forgot to apply my...rogaine! 
Forgot to remember...my pain! 
I never think, I never thought, 
oh maybe I'm insane! 
I think I like being 
way the fuck out of my brain! 
I forgot to remember; 
I forgot to remember my pain. 
Take me to your leader 
or die by the fly guy!

In the mind of a little girl
Shes alone and scared in her world
Marching soliders everywhere
The smell of burning flesh in the air
Dead bodies being taken away
People not knowing if they'll live to see the next day
In the mind of this little girl
She saw no hope for this world
Jewish died left and right
The screaming she heard lasted day and night
She doesn't understand why
She has no ability to cry
She is standing alone in a line
Waiting for her destiny
Her destiny's to die..

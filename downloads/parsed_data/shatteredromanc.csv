"event","I just watched a video on the chinese fur farms
this one pup, had his skin ripped off completely 
and was still alive. a skinless pup raised his head and looked straight into the camera. 
how people can wear fur and be okay with it
I dont get it. I really don't.
how could someone be soo cruel?
how can the world be so cruel as to let this happen?
imagine having the skin ripped right off your backs?
you know the burning feeling you get when you scrape 
your knees or cut yourself.....you'll never know 
the meaning of real pain."

"event","so, for my birthday, 
i've decided to make a new Lj
this one's getting old
and it's full of good memories
adam, manny, alex
me and the girls
and all the good times we shared
parties at my house
followed by the bad
my pets dying
people dying
hearts getting broken
people being used

but, now im turning 18
it's time to drift away
from that high school drama
and start anew. 
so, starting May 25, 
new LJ. I'm stuck on a name though.
I was thinking, makedamnsure
but im sure its taken. 
we'll see. my icon, will be my new background
I took it from a flyer advertising The Cocaine.
this club right across from the starbucks
shante works at in Lil Tokyo.
so try not to steal it.
I think I'll make this entry, public <3"

I have 2 days to update my San Diego application
and I have about 2 weeks left, to submit my Northlands application.
Gosh, I wanted it so badly. and the oppurtunity came to me and hit me in the face and im stuck on stupid.
I dont know what to write about myself.

-I love the environment and animal rights
I was overwhelmed to find this school
UNFORTUNATELY!
Im emotionally unstable
it causes me to have a lack on concentration
I'm not the over-achiever people expect me to be
I dont do as well in school as I could, because
there's always something more important in my life affecting me.
I dont have the determination to keep my morals around.
I'd be a bad addition to your school, because I'd probably become really lonely and depressed and kill myself.
I cant survive on my own.


ugh. why cant I ever get my priorities straight!



moms gone for the weekend.
I hope someone sleeps over.
I'm tired of being alone."

im screwed over. 

I really dont understand why he made the stupid group in the first place.

"event","I must say, this was one of the best parties by far. 
i mean, there was drama like always, people crying, like always, 
andrea puking, like always. but .... i dont know, it was different.
started last night at around 8ishpm and ended at 4 in the morning today.
I had a good time. met some new people, drank a 40oz and a half. which is a lot to me, cause i hate beer but I did it. first 40oz ever! be proud of me carrie. haha. even though you werent here to enjoy it. 
thanks to everyone who came, and to the girls, for taking care of me, and listening to my problems. and thank you so much for the second 40oz
I was like at the bottom of my first and then I got it taken away. and i got upset, and started yelling. and I was wanting to call Alex and I just wanted to get drunk and forget his name. and they frantically searched around town and bought me another cobra. so thanks girls. 

Rosie. I still dont know what was wrong, but, you know I love you. 
no one is replacing you, no one will ever replace you. He said that you felt as if cristal had taken your place. she hasnt. i know that you will always be willing to listen to me, and i know you love me. but still... I have my doubts on calling you. and the night of the gig. when you called me and then had to listen to me cry, it bothers me that you have to hear me like that. I hate it when you see me at my weakest moments,because I've never seen yours.

Cristal, thank you for talking with me. and taking care of the drama last night. I love you so much. you and rosie mean so much to me. and Im sorry that at times I take your friendships for granted. and everyone else too. 
I love you girls. and im sorry. crissy-poo, i know you dont understand, but you're always willing to listen and comfort me and I love you for that. 
for taking time away from everything else to make sure that im okay. 

Vickey, as jealous as I am, i dont hate you. really you deserve this as much as I want it. You've been though a lot with Fred and its nice to see you somewhat happy again. I feel like me and you have this connection, cause you understand, what its like to love someone who hurts you, physically and emotionally. and you and carrie.... when you cry, it makes me cry, cause I know what it feels like. so thanks. and hopefully, we have a good time today.

to my honey bunches of oats with almonds. you and I have been through a lot. and we keep getting hurt, and it seems so right for us to be together, but, Im scared. I dont know why. but I dont know.... I can't say anything. I need you more as a friend then anything right now. Let's not screw that up okay?

to everyone else... i love you all, and i cant write a paragraph for everyone but it doesnt mean i dont appreciate you!. thanks.
theres a couple of pictures but i need to go get ready, so I'll post em after my shower. be patient. and umm... I love you kids."

so like it was cute cause on the way there.
we were litening to FOB and Vickey was going all crazy in the back seat.
and me and her kept making fun of carrie and her ""fat man dance""
haha. Carrie! i love you
that shit was funny.
oh, so we got to the house and it was like whatevers.
I saw Beto and he was like ""i remember you"" and I just laughed.
Im still mad at him.
carrie bought me a smirnoff and I drank like half of it then gave it away. 
I wanted hot cocoa foos!
but yeah. I was bored. 
carrie and tinker make me sad. 
they just look so fuckin happy together and it makes me want to cry cause im not happy like that. and i miss that feeling.
and they're just so effin cute together.
i envy them.
then me and carrie went outside with Tinker and he got us high. 
and like I had some, and then carrie was like ""are you high yet?""
and im like ""no"" 
and she looks at tinker and she's like ""baby, she's not high"" 
and he hands me some more. and i just laughed.
good times.
we got home at like 11:30 and i dunno that was it.
carrie slept over and she was mad for a while, cause i was online talking to  alex and she said i was ignoring her. 
but she got to see tinker and i havent seen alex.
but then we had a nice chat. and I love her so much. 
I still want to go to Candy Cane Lane! 
bitches. 
they were playing this really awesome song that I need to look up. 
oh! so casualties are playing in march again at the Henry Fonda Theatre and drea wants everyone who went last year to go...including manny.
that's not a good idea! considering what happened last year
and especially if Adam ends up being there again.
Fuck no! If anyone is going to kick Adam's ass, its going to be me!
Fuckin prick. 


So this morning, my mom wanted me and my sis to go get dough to make tamales.

Tech Romance <3

I'm sick of seeing you cry
And wasting all your time
On someone who will never care enough
To make you feel loved
To make you feel safe
I would drop my life to take his place

To show you just how good
Being touched could be
Commit these words to memory
For when you find yourself
Pinned under his demands
I am still an option that you have

So carry me around
Like a picture in your purse
Pull me out when things are at their worst

You can show up at my house
Completely unannounced
We'll have that movie kiss we talked about"

Under one umbrella, just talking and joking
And I knew that I'd love you, for as long as you'd let me

And I haven't caught my breath since the moment that we met

"event","why'd I do it?
cause Im a fuckin trooper!

damn. best show by far.
so here's how the story of (your face!) went down:

let's see....manny picked me up after school and we headed straight for San Diego. Now I hadnt really eaten all day, and it was friday, I was tired and grouchy and hungry plus I was super uper sleepy.
but okay, let me try to remember. 

okay, so we got there at around 6:30. I was a little dissapointed cause there was a long line already and im always so used to getting there early to shows. 
but hey, at least I went right?
Soma wasnt as great as I thought it would be. it was kinda ugly, and located in like a shopping center. haha. but it was pretty big.

so I got in and headed straight for the stage, pushed my way foward and got a pretty good view. I was maybe the forth person behind the baracade.
alright so line up is as follows:
""omething"" reckless ( i forgot their name), He is legend, Haste the Day and From First to Last.

OMG! the lead singer from He is Legend is a sex god!
He looked like a pirate, and he had this scruffy beard going on. and like he was wearing this tight button up shirt with a little vest, some tight black pants and the most adorable chain belt that looked like it would jingle when you move your hips. he was sooo adorable dancing on stage and mmm... yes. 

Haste the Day was really good! it was cute, they started out with the fuckin star wars theme. haha. dorks. it was awesome. until they played this one song that towards the middle, it got all slow and like everyone took out their lighters and cell phones. The lyrics made me cry. Hope no one saw that.

OKay, so by the time they were done, I was dehydrated, starving and on the verge of passing out. This nice couple next to us gave us some water and like I drank it and I felt a little better, so I thought i would be able to hold out. And a couple minutes later, I felt like I was going to fall and puke. So we got out and we headed up the stairs and I fell, like almost fainted. and he had to pick me up and I fell on the floor next to the door. I got some water, drank like half of it and said ""i need to go back"" so I gathered my strength, yes this story is getting all cheesy, and I walked back to the stairs. We were standing there and like the lights turned off and everyone was cheering and they came out. OMG! 
So they started off by playing note to self. and what does my dumbass do?
I fuckin run into the crowd! why? cause im a fuckin trooper babY!
I dont care that I couldnt handle it, I could be on the floor twitching and I'd still be singing my ass off!
it was soo great. I would get all crazy, then get dizzy, then get all crazy again, then drink water, then go all crazy again. haha. 
ooh! so then the busted out with a circle pit. it reminded me of a punk pit, only with more scrawny people, and hardcore dancing. 
So I joined in. It was pretty fun. my first hardcore pit ever. 
my hardcore dancing wasnt as lame though. haha. 
so they ended their set by playing emily. not a good idea. 
I started crying. yes, im pathetic i know. 
but i couldnt help it. it was our song. 
hope nobody saw that one either.
then they did an encore with umm....i dont remember what song it was but that one and ride the wings of pestilence. 
I got in the pit for that one too. 
yup. then. I went to go pee, cause I really needed to pee.
then I got some merch. 
then we went to dell taco.
omg! we were at the drive thru for 15 min!
then we headed home. 
I fell asleep after I ate and so I cant tell you much about the ride home. 
but I got home at like 1:10 or something. 

this morning I woke up at like 8am to go to the Day of Service at school. 
we did some planting. it was boring. cristal ate a worm. 
lunch was oh so good! all these places donated food! and omg... it was orgasmic.
then me and danny started debtating animal rights again, eventually I had to give up cause I had just eaten a tommy's burger so.... my values didnt count.
And now im bored for the day so I give you the oh so exciting details of my night. yay!.
carrie was suppose to come and we were all gonna hang out with the tipsies but she's spending the day with tinker. love-struck whore!
okay. im done. 
night night."

I really need to start focusing again.

best day ever!
gosh these schools are so competitive. I just went to have a good time. 
and I did. 
one reason in particular of course. but that is for me to know. 
I met a celebrity! andy frasco from myspace!
oh no! haha. he's so great at playing the piano. 
I love him.
the ride there was fun. Adelle me mikey and alice!
we're so wacky. 
me and adelle clung to eachother all day. good times i must say
haha. we were tripping out on the bathroom and how there was a bench in there! and omg! the fireplace. 
gosh, franklin's so ghetto. 
the food sucked.
during the lunch break me and mikey were desperately walking around campus looking for a fag. 
ugh! I regretted not taking mine.
cristal's getting me into the bad habit of smoking on the way to school
my poor baby's at my house all sicky-poo. 
cause she's been spending the week at my house and she got sicky last night. 
i hope you feel better cris!
and you better not be going through my underwear drawer. 
fuck those chicks from Angola were so fuckin smart. 
when they had to present their trade issue. 
wow. 
and those guys from that one country. 
haha. they were so cute.
I gave him my last card and said ""well, only cause you're cute""
haha. 
andy looked adorable in his bright bright costume. 
we had white shirts with a paper flag stapled on to them.
looooosers!
but it was killer. 
I wish I could go back. 
and possibly do some things sooner. haha.
thank you mikey. I really cant thank you enough.
for doing what you did. it was the highlight of a bad week.
and thanks to all the girls for telling me to ""stop being a pussy and just go""

i guess I just have to give it time. 

that's all I have. time. 
I havent been feeling very good lately. 
i have the flu right now, but it's not that.
I dont know what it is. 
it's like a bad omen or something. 

college applications are done. 
im gonna stay in Ca. 
it's a good thing I guess.
i cant survive on my own
im a weak person. 
im filling out 2 applications out of state. 
i just wanna know if I have what it takes. 



me and manny were at the mall yesterday and I was telling him that I was very happy for him. and that like he finally looked pinkish again. 
cause usually when you're depressed for a long time, you start to lose color.
and he's like ""is that why you look so pale?"" 
then i came home and realized it. what happened to the girl who wouldnt leave home without hairspray and eyeliner... im just not myself anymore. 
i need friends. desperately. im faling apart."

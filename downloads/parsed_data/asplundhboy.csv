"event","Today was a good day. As a matter of fact, i somehow managed a 95 on my physics quiz. Imagine that. the lab we did today was fucking sweez. I felt really shitty in the morning and pretty much until i got out of school and went home. Im driving the caddilac and it's the shit. Some guy fucking pulled right next to us (my friend chas and I) and said we were the coolest fucking kids on the beach. 'L yes!"

"event","School was pretty hard today, i had some trouble in physics. Gonna need some xtra help on that one :). Otherwise, its a good day, but i think the girl i like is depressed so i dont know what to do? (Lianne, advice plz?). There is another girl, but she's a sophomore and in the ""cool"" group so i don't know, how, when, or where to approach her. I also suck @ conversations so....w/e. I skipped soccer today b/c i was feeling lazy. NO FREE PERIOD TOMORROW :(. History quiz too. Wonder how it'll be? Hopefully easy. Wellp, Peace out"

"event","<P>We lost our soccer game very badly. Troubles with opposite sex which I'd rather not speak of. Thats all for now, it sucks that i have no game and i never will. I guess im depressed? Who knows? I can't tell. Sometimes i feel i am, others i don't. Whatever.</P>"

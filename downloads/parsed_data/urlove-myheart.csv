"event","you left a guy who told you where to be and when.
i was with a girl who tried to sleep with my best friend.
we both took comfort in each other's messy lives.
finding warmth on that cold november night.

we swore it'd be years before we brought that on again.
days later you said that we should be more than just friends.
i let my guard down cuz the feelings were so strong.
but acted stupid and thats when he came along.

its been so long, i should just move on
there's other fish in the sea
but i keep hoping you'll swim back home to me

we'd sneak out and go swimming late at night
you're one of few who can say they've seen me cry
you've got my quirkiness and awkward sense of humor
we shared simpson quotes and started made up rumors

if night turned into day you'd hide me from your mom
i could never fight with you cuz you were never wrong
this time especially the blame is all on me
if i'd not screwed things up i wonder where we'd be

it's been so long, i should just move on
there's other fish in the sea
but i keep hoping you'll swim back home to me

one day for no reason
i broke our date
so you made other plans that day
and that's when you met him
and why you're still with him today

it's been so long, i should just move on
there's other fish in the sea
but i keep hoping you'll swim back home to-
i'm just glad i got a chance to know you
you'll forever be the one that got away



-

Walk home,
Drowning these memories in the rain
Biting my lip to transfer this pain
You're gone,
And I'm still going through withdrawl
Next time around I'll build a stronger wall

You broke my guard with guiltless eyes
Devoured me like a virus from inside
And came back just to salt the wounds
Now thanks to you...

I started running out
I started running away
When I get too close I'm scared to stay
I started running out
I started running away
Now others pay for your mistakes

You needed more attention then I gave
Instead of talking you just played games
And smiled
As my whole world became unstitched
I wish I'd know you could be such a heartless bitch

You broke my guard with guiltless eyes
Devoured me like a virus from inside
And came back just to salt the wounds
Now thanks to you..."

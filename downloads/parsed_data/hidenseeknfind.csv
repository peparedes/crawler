I am really liking my schedule for this semester. I work three times a week and I go to school to times a week. So, I have Fridays and Sundays off! Lovely!

However, haha, on Friday nights, I might actually be doing power point for the youth! Can someone say nerd?!? Haha, just joking. I very much appreciate all who are talented in this arena. Soon, I will be. Just for me, I can say that it is a wee bit out of my comfort zone. We'll see how it goes!

This semester, I am taking two english classes and one french class (for those of you who are interested). I am excited for all of them. All of my profs are very unique. For example:

My fiction proff is a total hippy. She wears long flowy skirts and says words like groovy a lot!
My french proff is a total purist (if I spelt that right) with everything, from being Canadian to grammaire.
My poetry proff is a total englishman. He has the accent, the monotone voice, the whole kit and kabootle!Mind you, everything he says is so.... DeeP! And IntROspEctIVe!

Therefore, school is fun!

For my fiction class we were discussing the aspects of a hero's journey. One girl did, Simba from the Lion king, another did the last unicorn... I randomly decided to talk about Jesus and he last 12 hours on earth before he was crucified. It was interesting. Though I was totally nervous about how the girls would react, they didn't freak out on me, or say, that's dumb, or why would you talk about Jesus in an english course (these were all thoughts going through my head). In the end, I had shared the message of the gospel with four girls and in the end, I discovered that one of them was already a Christian (who totally knew where I was going with the whole thing and was nodding and smilling while I nervously tried to put all my thoughts into sentances). Cool??? I thought so!

But anyway, I need to take my brother to physio. Ciao for now! I hope to touch base with you soon!

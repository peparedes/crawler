"event","Complete and total adoration,
My gift to you, my heart was yours.
In ten weeks you shaped it, 
In one night you murdered it.
Torn from my chest and laid at your feet,
That first step that you took was the worst.
Since then you've walked a thousand miles in solace and short remark,
And I still have these memories,
But we'll never see what we could have been.
Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now?
Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go?
Remember. cause that's all you can do.
We'll never make another memory,
We'll never make another memory.
I wish I'd have died in your arms the last time we were together,
So I wouldn't have to wake without you today.
This time I thought things were real.
You said they were.
What happened?
You were a priority, 
Was I an option?
I let you see a side of me that I don't share with anyone.
Promises are just words unless they are fulfilled.
you knew from the beginning all I had to offer you was my heart,
I'm sorry that wasn't enough.
So, we'll go our own ways,
And hopefully you'll remember the things I've told you,
Hopefully you'll understand that everything I said was in sincerity.
A broken heart is not what I wanted from this,
But I guess I've learned from it.
But aren't you supposed to learn from your mistakes?
I don't consider this a mistake,
I just wish the story didn't end this way,
Cause I'm still in love with the person who helped me write it.
Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go?
Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now?"

"event","so....tonight was an interesting night.  i saw 2 people throw up and one friend was sent to the hospital.  wow.  what a record.  also, ive never seen jasmine that drunk!!  speaking of which, i wonder if shes online.  i hope she made it home ok.  she was a little tipsy at the pacifico.
so i think the oxford gang might be in a little trouble.  but, lets not go there.  why the fuck did everyone have to abandon me and jon at the bar alone?  fuck sakes.  it was a tad cold standing out there for a half hour or so waiting for someone who wasnt even at the bar.  shit.  jasmine is never gonna hear the end of this.
so i think my buddy has to have his stomach pumped.  that aught to be nice.  poor guy.  thats gonna be a big bill.  atleast hes getting some help and be feeling better in a day or so.  too bad he didnt have his Blue Card on him.  shit.  i wonder what happens if you dont have your blue card....wish he would have listened to us and stopped drinking after he fell backward and hit four or five people.
i feel like going for a drive.  maybe i will.  at least im not as drunk as everyone else.  im down to one last cigarette and im bored as fuck and no one is answering their phones!!!  driving sounds like so much fun when you are drunk, alone and bored as fuck.  yes.  a drive it shall be."

"event","so i picked up all the pictures that we have together last night.  all the prom ones and the ones from my Irving Christmas party.  ouch.  that hurt a little.  you looked fucking hot in that dress.  you still do look fucking hot now.
when you said that you went away this weekend to a b&b, it made me think about the camping trips we used to take and the trip to liscomb and how much fun we had and all the naughty little things we used to do together.  like the sauna...  Five Islands and the awesome waterfall that you wanted to see so bad.  that was nice. we should have asked if we could swim there.  and Sherbrook Village.  nice little spot, but got caught in the rain.  and then the times we went to the cottage.  the huge lightning storm that we watched from my couch and i held you just a little tighter and closer evertime the thunder clapped.  and all of our fourwheeling trips where i would teach you how to drive.
so much that makes it hurt that much more everytime i think aboout you.  i guess its probably time to move on.  not like its going to happen though.  probably wont for a long time.  like everyone says, there are always more fish in the sea.  stupid fucking little phrase.  no one will ever live up to you and what you meant to me.  no one can compare to what you have shown me or taught me and no one will ever be able to take your place.
we should still go meet our birth parents together though.  you promised.

I would give up forever to touch you,
cause i know that you feel me some how.
You're the closest to heaven that i will ever be
and i dont want to go home right now.

All i can taste is this moment
and all i can breath is your life
cause sooner or later its over
i just dont want to miss you tonight"

"event","wow, i had i really wierd dream last night.  first it started off awesome.  it was around the end of september and i was still living in halifax but so were my parents and i was over visiting them at the time.  i was starting to get back with allison and everything started looking up for me.  all of a sudden i hear an announcment on tv that said to evacuate halifax immediately because there was about to be a huge nuclear explosion.  i looked out the window and i could see accross the harbour where the explosion was going to come from.  these two or three huge smoke stacks started pouring out nuclear gas all over dartmouth and filled the entire sky with toxic gas and the clouds turned bright red and orange colors.  suddenly on of the smoke stacks erupted and took out most of dartmouth.  
during this me and my family were getting a few things together so we could leave immediately and be out of harms way.  we only took a few basic things that we really wanted to keep like my guitar and my cd's.  and we grabbed a few clothes as quickly as we could before everything in halifax was demolished.  the whole time i was worried sick about allison and how she would get out of this.  after a few minutes a there was a second explosion which took out more of dartmouth.  after we got in the car i had to go back and get allison to make sure she would be ok.  i told my parents that the drive was a quicker way to get out of halifax anyways and she would probably be ready when we got there because i wasn't leaving without her.  i said i would stay and get her myself if it came down to it, so the decided it was alright since it was a quicker way out of halifax.
as we were all getting into the car and driving away as fast as we could we saw all the ships in the harbour trying to get out and onto the ocean out of the way of the final explosion.  we were driving and we could see the final explision about to happen.  all of dartmouth, the ground, the buildings and even the harbour were violently shaking and rumbling.  people were outside dying and burning alive and you could hear painful screams across the harbour.  as we were on our way to get allison the last of the explosions occured.  this was by far the biggest explosion, but it was completely quite.  just as the explosion, gas and nuclear waste dispersed all over dartmouth and halifax and just reached us i could start to feel my skin burning and melting away and everything in the path of the explosion was desintegrating right in front of my eyes.  even the house i was in at the time just seemed to disapear as the explosion hit me.
the dream was really vivid.  when the first explision happened i could feel the heat off of it and i saw things blow up just like in the movies.  pretty fucked up eh?"

im so fucking enraged right now, you have no idea. im this close to calling him up and asking him how my dick tastes when he kisses her.  would that be a bad idea?  meh, oh well.  i wonder what would happen?  *dream bubble*

so this is the last time i come home to see you.  i wish moving on was alot easier.  maybe robyn might have been a good girlfreind if i wasn't still madly in love with you.  once again, i get fucked over like usual.  everyone always said i had the shittiest luck.  i think i just might have a few drinks and go for a drive.  i like racing.

so im all moved into my new apartment.  this place is awesome.  and i already had two parties.  nice.  now all i gotta do is get my posters up on the wall.  my room still looks a little bare even with all the furniture.

got out golfing this weekend.  i sucked horribly.  shot 110 on 18 holes.  how shitty is that?  oh well, had fun though.

well, off to work again.  another shitty day at the office.  i think they are hiring a few ppl very shortly on my shift.  that might be interesting.  now me and mel can go home early instead of jessica.  (stupid little stuck up, prissy, spoiled bitch)"

so this is what adultery feels like....hmm.  i kinda like it haha.  but only with you.  i wish i could do all that stuff over and over again.  i wish i had you back in my arms.  ill do anything.  i still love you and im still in love with you.  i wish you were here because it really sucks without you here.

"event","After two years and seven months, it hurts coming home after work to remember that you have nobody to call. My whole life revolved around her and i liked that.  It doesn't just hurt to think that i am alone again and without her, but it hurts to think that shes moving on so much faster than i am and to know that she will be with someone else probably very soon.  But i will respect her fully.  No matter how much it goddamn well fuckin hurts.  Her next boyfreind better be some fucking good to her because if he breaks her heart, i will break his face. Mark my word.  I will always be there for her anytime.  But im still not ready to face the fact that i wont be able to put my arms around her and kiss her, tell her i love her, rub her shoulders and feet and rub all of her lotions on her body.  Go to bed and wake up next to her.  And this isnt even the worst part of it all.  The worst is the fact that she will be doing everything that we have done together with someone else.  Ouch.

Atleast i still have photos and every single email that she has ever sent me in my inbox.  I was about to read through some of them, but that would kill me even more.  So many memories of her.  She is everything that i have known for almost three years and everything i know is gone.

I havent even told my parents yet.  Fuck.  What am i gonna tell them?  They are gonna wanna talk about it and gonna ask me millions of questions, awkward questions.  Bleh.  They tried talking to me when i broke up with kristin.  goddamn.  that was fuckin awkward.  i can almost hear them trying to talk to me about it now.  Maybe they will find out from someone else and just leave it well alone.  Yeah, like that will fuckin happen.

Well, off to play more Super Mario World...alone."

It is going to be hard to go anywhere in the corolla because of all the memories that go along with it.  the camping trips, beach nights, liqour runs to wentworth, to the movies, moncton, to halifax to see you, our little parking sessions, the cougar, prom, graduation for the both of us, sitting and talking in the driveway, use of head room, and even when the cops stopped us.  i can remember all the times we just went driving to be alone and talk.  the night i got caught with my ass in the air at the shooting range.  hitting the shovel.  teaching you to drive.  i still remember all the times we went camping.  those were some good times.  wentworth, five islands, to the waterfall.  i remember the day that first got to see you naked as i rubbed your back for you in your upstairs hallway.  all the little internet cartoons that you have got me hooked on.  the times we played guitar at the foot of my stairs and watched movies on my computer.  all the fourwheeling trips we went on.  when i came to PEI for you.  

these last two and half years flew by.  it feels like i just started dating you, the time has flew so fast and its already over.  too many memories to mention.  but i will not forget them.  they will always be with me.  i will forever be yours and you know it.  i wish i could say the same about you.  i wish you were still mine.  i wish we could still be together.  i love you and i will always love you."

"event","SO i can't go anywhere until i get my car fixed and i need some food.  the belt on my car engine is frayed and about to break so i cant drive it anywhere or i will be fucked.  on a good note, this weekend was awesome except for the fact that i didnt get to see The Tea Party but thats ok because Allison was here all weekend with me.  Economy Shoe Shop was fuckin great, (someone stopped me to ask how to get there as i was walking to the bus after work) and Cora's was awesome too.

So i figured out what im going to buy with my tips that i have rolled so far.  I either am going to put them toward an Xbox or a new guitar.  What do you think?  Wrestlemania 21 comes to the Xbox soon and i want to play it real bad.  I think im going to go for a new Explorer.  Probably Epiphone.  Nice sound because it is a Gibson company and it have a full explorer body.

Xbox or Guitar?  help me out here.

Ill be comin home this coming sunday if i can get my car fixed and ready for the road.  Hopefully lucas can give me a hand with it.

On a different topic:  Why is it so hard to get in contact with you?  You barely talk to me on MSN, when I call you never talk because you are talking to someone else or you have to go because you are doing something, you wont talk to me when you are with your freinds because it is ""impolite"".  Even if i havent talked to you for days you still have some reason not to talk to me.  Its starting to seem awkward talking to you.  There are so many little spaces filled with tension and awkwardness.  It takes you forever to message me back when im trying to have a conversation with you and you dont even care when we have to go.  And when i ask you to call, why wont you call?  I always end up calling you and you are always busy doing something anyways.  You promised you would call after badminton numerous times and never did.  You always have a reason not to talk to me.  What did i do to make you not want to talk to me?  Whats wrong with talking to me?  Why cant you talk to me?  Did i do something wrong?  Am i that shitty of a conversationalist?  Like, seriously.  Why is it so hard to get in contact with you?  You would talk to anyone for a long time, but when you are with freinds i can never talk to you for more than 30 seconds.  You have no problem talking to Kent while im with you, but when you are with Kent you wont even give me the time of day.  Something seem a little odd to anyone?  Maybe its just me, but i smell something fishy.  Would anyone else be a little curious if this happened to you?  I think you would be a little upset if you called me while i was with Melanie and i couldnt talk.  If you dont want me to call, tell me and i wont bother.  I just kinda thought you might like to hear your boyfreinds voice once in a while."

"event","Well Danny Mainstreet was fuckin awesome!  Ben baught me a beer.  He was like ""hey, i know you, your Matt!  Have a free beer!""  and we talked for a while about life and the band and how shit was goin.  They played a wonderful show.  I wish you could have been there.  I probably wouldnt have drank so much if you were there, but i missed you and was hopin you were havin a good of night as i was.  I met a few new freinds, one that i already know and see everyday and told her to see me if she needed some coffee lol.  She also said to take my resume to her and she would get me a job instantly.  It sounded really good!

Im sorry for ruining your night.  I just wanted to hear your voice, but i understand your reasoning.  I didnt meant to fuck up your night.  I was wishing you were having a good night too.  I am onjoying Halifax emensly, but i wish you were here.  I hope your job hunt goes ok.  and like i said before, you are always welcome at my place for free so you can find a job down here.  I know of lots that i can get you.

So i found out that ""sexy guy""'s name is really Steve lol.  and he is going to get me more passes to the dome.  I wished Danny Mainstreet luck and the band before them (i forget their name) goodluck and told them they did an awesome job and played and aweseome show.

I wish you could have come.  I miss you like crazy and wish i treated you alot better than i do now.  Im sorry for all the pain i have caused you and i wish i could take back everything that i have ever done to make you mad or hurt you in any way.   You are my true love and i want to be with you and only you.  No one else.  I love you and miss you.  I hope you are thinking about me just as much as i am.  i also wish that you could tell me that you love me when you are around anyone but its ok.  I love you and i know that you love me as well."

"event","first night without you and it already hurts like a sonofabitch.  i know we have had some shitty moments in the last few nights, but i love you more than ever and i hope the same from you.  this is going to be THE loniest summer ever.  i miss everything about you already and wish i could have had more time to hold you and feel your warm body against mine.  It has only been a few short hours without you and already everything is fucking up.  Im probably not going to the Motorhead concert(because i didnt get the tickets earlier like a good boy), Its rainy as fuck and its raining HARD.  My batteries died on the way over to watch Backlash.  When i got there, we watched about 40 minutes and the wind knocks the dish out of its place and the show is over for us.  So i went to go home and when i got there my bus had already left so i had to get Lucas to drive me home at 4 in the morning after he got the dish back up and we watched Backlash.  Now im sitting here wondering why the fuck am i such a bastard to you.

So yeah, i hope you know that im missing you more and more every second that i cant hear your pretty voice or see your beautiful face and smile.  I can still almost hear your voice talking to me in my ear and i look around immediately to see if you had returned to me.  And thats the way its going to be all summer.

I wish you were here now.  Everything around me reminds me of you and it makes it that much harder to deal with the fact that you are gone pretty much two months.  Funny how little things can trigger huge amounts of memories to come flooding back to you almost enough to make you cry.  I remember all the times we would go for a drive just to talk and be alone together, way out to the Dickie Road or out Colbec or River Phillip or Collingwood just to talk and be together away from everyone and everything else.

I heard a song tonight that reminded me of all those happy memories we have shared over the years and made me almost wish that i hadnt have moved to Halifax so that i could see you when you moved home in the summer.  But i dont regret it.  It was a wise choise.  I guess i wouldnt be where I am now if I hadnt have moved.

I miss the old days and the good times.  I wish you knew what you really mean to me.  I wish we both knew what we mean so we wouldnt take each other for granted.  I wish i knew what i meant to you.  I wish i was the only one for you.  The right one.  Like the old days.  I wish we could talk to each other more openly about anything, just shoot the shit.  I wish that i could come home and have you waiting with open arms to greet me and ask me how my day was and then we would sit down and have a cup of coffee and sit and talk and talk and talk, about anything and everything.  I wish i could do the same for you.  I wish i could be the one you come home to and ask how your day ways and take your jacket and hang it up and take your shoes off for you and give you a nice foot or back rub while we have a nice conversation about anything.  Maybe i just want to be a domestic house husband and cook for you and wait on you hand and foot and get you drinks while you lay in bed and bring you home flowers and treats after work.  Is it bad that i want to be your Mr. Right?  Im failing at it.  Im sorry.  You know i mean well.  I just suck at pleasing you.

On another note, Mayra moved in yesterday and i still havent gotten to meet her yet.  Is it wierd that there has been someone living in the next room down the hall from you for a couple of days and you dont even know what she looks like?   Also, i should be the fuck in bed because i gotta get up early tomorrow 'cuz me and Jonathon are going to Music Stop to gawk and drool over very nice and expensive musical intruments that are way out of my budget and price range.  I can dream cant I?

I love you Allison, i hope you are thinking about me because i sure know I am.  I think i kept your teddy bear for a reason.  Something to remind me of you.  Something to hold while i sleep (wierd, i know, but it actually helps alot)."

"event","so, the fighting is getting out of hand and annoying, just like i am annoying to you and everyone else.  yes, i wanted you in the shower with me just like i always do.  a shower at your place isnt a shower unless you are there with me.  the party was good, i had a good time with you and your drunk/sick self lol.  i enjoyed taking care of you and making you drinks and such.  i had a good time with you.  but back to the point.

fighting is getting out of hand again.  we were doin good and now were back to shit and is everything ok now?  im done writing about you and our problems here.  im tired of bashing you and letting everything out here.  i wont do it anymore.  im tired of you bashing me here too.  if you have something to say, say it to my face or email me.  i will do the same.  im sure everyone is getting tired of hearing about our stupid little fights that go nowhere.  im tired of sitting on your bed listening to you type bad shit about me and our relationship and how im not good enough for you and how kent is so much better yada yada yada, all that other good shit.  and im tired of doing the same thing.  what im doing now is going to be the last time i do it.  i will not badmouth you and keep anything hidden from you that should be told to your face.

i love you dearly allison but we have got to stop the immature bf/gf bashings online and say them straight up.

and for the second issue.  im not fighting over you with kent anymore.  im not competing against him.  i refuse to do it.  after two and half years of competing against him, im done.  i shouldnt have to.

So today was beautiful.  I got out driving with Allison, which was nice and then i went to rent a game for certain reasons.  I should have done laundry. Oh well.  I should have called my parents and my grandmother too.  But ya know.

So i rented WWE Smackdown: Bring on the Pain.  What a cool game after you get the hang of the controls lol.  Ther is alot of shit to do in that game.  Good ol cage matches and Bra and Panty matches eh?  That game is really addictive lol.

Anyways, not much goin on here except for that pretty cool video in Caleb's Final Fantasy.  Wish i could be in it.

"event","Well, i just counted my tips.  It came to a whopping 264 dollars and then some odd change.  Go tips.  Counting and rolling tips and listening to Megadeth are very calming.  Good ol' rage venters.  mmm Rage.

So the Chinese food last night was good...the fighting was not.  How the fuck does a couple fight trying to order Chinese food?  Where did it start?  Why were you so pissed off when i arrived?  I only went to get your fuckin food for you and you bitched at me for what?  Why the hell were you so pissed off?  You say you had a bad day yesterday but did you have to take it out on me?  It coulda been a great night.

I need food.  Mini Pizza's are cooking.  Yum

I might as well get out everything that has been bothering me here since it didn't all get said the other night when we were ""talking"".  Its almost pointless to try to talk to you about my problems.  You always have to have a bigger problem with me and I never get anything said that i want to.  So im saying it here.  Were fucked up.  Bad.  Do you want to continue this relationship at all?  Do you even want it to be fixed and better?  I sure do.  Ive been trying desperately.  I love you and you know that.  It really fucking hurts to love you.  But i do anyways.  I have an unconditional love for you thats not going to change.

You say that i can tell you everything.  All my problems and what is bothering me and that you will help and change whatever needs to be changed to help me and i would do the same without question.  But i have told you over and over what was really bothering me and nothing has changed.  The last time that I told you i wanted something changed we went on a ""break"".  Nothing ever came of it.  Well im going to tell you again, like it or not.

He has been a big part of our relationship.  It fucking sucks.  He means more to you than I do.  He always has.  Yes, i am pretty fucking jealous of your relationship because we dont have that.  We used to but somewhere along the way it just stopped.  I wish you could see things through my eyes and feel what i do.

Sorry to keep bitching about him to my freinds but if i talk to you about it you get pissed off and defend him but i bet you wouldnt defend me.  I obviously cant vent to you about him so i have to go somewhere else.  You know that little article in the Comso magazine?  Yeah, well it tells the truth.  Your little relationship with him is fucking me up pretty bad.  Yes, i do have serious rage issues with him as you can plainly see.  But you do nothing to change that.  Ive told you over and over that i dont want your relationship with him to end.  I want you to be freinds.  If i did tell you that i wanted it to end, you would be completely miserable.  All i would like you two to be is freinds but you are obviously more than just freinds.  You seem to make lots of time for him when he comes down on the weekends but you would never make time for me on the weekend or ever for that matter.  You said that you would make time for me this weekend because he was coming down again next weekend.  That never happened.  I rushed home to be with you and have fun and hang out with you and you sat in your room doing an essay and mostly talking online and to him on the phone.  Yes, i probably could have went over to Melanies to drink with her but i chose to spend my time with you.

It also seem like you are pretty jealous of me hanging out with her.  Why?  I have no idea.  You have no reason to be jealous.  What, do you think something is going to happen and im going to cheat on you?  HA, yeah right, not with her husband there too.  SO personally, i think that little article about me cheating on you didnt apply to me.

And back to the Kent issue.  Still hurt by what he has been saying behind your back?  Im just a little pissed off at him.  Now i do have a good reason to hate him.  Would you be pissed off at Melanie if she went behind my back and told a bunch of lies?  Some freind he is eh?  It doesnt matter how fucking drunk he was, he still shouldn't be talking trash behind your back.  Just the same as that little episode when Nick came down to visit.  Shouldn't have happened no matter how fucking drunk you were or how pissed off you were for some reason.  I get shit faced all the time, but im still completely faithful to you and i dont talk shit behind your back, or anyone else's, no matter how drunk i am.  So you go to your Kent and make everything better because, like you said, you are probably going to end up with him anyways.  Ouch.  That was harsh.  Just like the little comment you made about panty shopping.  Also ouch.

Also, yes.  I do remember that i was talking to him when i was drunk.  Just fucking with him a little bit, nothing serious.  Though the temptation was there to tell him to fuck off and go to hell because i was trying some hard not to.

Oh, heres a question for you.  Why can't we both hang out when he is down for the weekend?  I dont see why we cant.  You know i would be fucking civil towards him.  Im not gonna fuckin say anything and start shit.  All i wanna do is hangout with my girlfreind and have some fun.  But nope, it would probably be a little awkward with us both being in the same room wouldnt it?  I have no problem with it.  So you tell me why i shouldnt be a little curious as to whether or not your being faithful.  You would probably be a little hurt if i have another woman over for the weekend at my apartment and didnt let you come over.  You would probably be a little curious to whether or not im being faithful too.  Here is a little info for you.  I have always and always will be faithful to you.  No matter how drunk i am and no matter how mad i am at you or how much temptation may be there.  I will always be faithful.

So yeah, looks like most of the problems in our relationship happen because of him.  Hes tried to take you away from me numerous times and still is trying.  And now hes trying to make you choose between us?  Some good freind he is.  Sorry to say, but i think a ""best freind"" should be there to help you out and support you and be happy for you and your relationship.  Not try to take it away and fuck it up.  Personally, i would have a little respect for another couple.  I would leave them the fuck alone, not try to split them up and not make her choose between me or her boyfreind.  I wouldnt talk all lovey dovey to her and i wouldnt spent the night at her house alone or in the same room or on the same bed.  For reasons that the boyfreind would probably be a little pissed off (like me) and probably kick my ass.  Maybe im just a little old fashioned, but i do believe in monogomy.  I dont believe there should be a third wheel in a relationship.  Because right now, i have been feeling like the third wheel in the relationship and i have been feeling that way for a long time.  Its great that hes there to support you when we have troubles or whenever you have troubles, but i dont think he should be trying to break us up and take you away from me.

It also seems pretty hard for you to let people know that i am with you at the time.  Ive heard you say that you are busy, or have company or have people over, but not once have i heard you say that your boyfreind is here or that Matt is over.  

Maybe im just over reacting a wee little but, but this stuff is bothering me and has been bothering me.  Anyone else think im over reacting just a little bit?  Little things do matter alot to me.  Every little thing that you do matters to me.  I notice everything about you.  From the way your hair moves, they way you walk and just little things you do when you are writing something down or that little smile you get on your face when you are concentrating on something.  I do notice little things about you.  You may think i dont, but i do.  So please, tell me.  Am i overreacting?

I dont want to lose you, but somehow it seems like its drawing very near.  I will fight to keep you, wish you would do the same.  I would like a little feedback and your thoughs on what i have just said.

P.S. - its only around 8:30, anyone want to go drinking?"

I am saying all of this here because i know it probably wont get said directly or it will never come up.  Sorry to anyone who has to listen to me bitch and complain but this needs to be done.  If you dont want to listen to be bitch, then dont.

I dont know what to think anymore.  I dont see this working out anymore and i dont see it lasting for much longer.  I want it to, but i just can't see it anymore either.  You have no feelings for me anymore.  You can tell that there hasn't been any feelings for a long time.  I am the third party in the relationship again.  I guess I have always been the third party in the relationship though.  There are more important people in your life than me.  Like Him.  He's always had a higher place in your heart than me.  Everyone has a higher place in your heart than me now.
Im tired of being last in line for you love and attention.  Im growing tired of begging you for attention and still all my actions go un-noticed.  Whenever you are with him you are never online or even near the computer but when I am over you are never off of it.
You will gladly make time for him, but never time for me.  He comes thursdays and leaves sundays and you are with him the whole time but whenever i am over, you barely give me the time of day.  I know i've said this before but I hate the way he talks to you and the way you talk back.  I've heard you both say it and ive seen it.  You dont even talk to me like that anymore.  Pesronally, I dont think its right but everytime i mention it, you say the same thing ""its only a freind thing and ive been best freinds with him since before we started dating!"".  Yeah, well i dont really care if you've been ""best freinds"" since before me, it hurts to hear and see you guys talking like that.  You spend more nights at his place than you do mine.  oh wait, you've never spent a night at my place.  And you still have never told me where he slept those times that i asked.  Got something to hide?  You got pretty pissed off when i asked.

And speaking of Lisa;  I guess im not staying at her place this summer, shes way too pissed off at me.  Matt is going home, we had talked over a litte about an apartment for the summer.  Allison and Sel are moving home.  Im fucked.  Moving down to Halifax seemed like such a good idea.  I love it here.  I have a few freinds that actually want to hang out with me.  Good freinds.  Nicest people in the world I have ever met.  Great freinds.  I got screwed over bigtime by moving down here but I had to get away from Oxford and my parents somehow and yet they still try to control me a little but thats ok, I can handle that.

On another point.  Thanks.  But something has to change.  Im not sure what but something.  Yeah, yeah, I know, same old story to everyone, thanks for caring, thanks for the help.  No one could ever possibly know.  

I would wish you well right now, but I've been thinking, so I wont.  No one wants to hear it anyways.  (thanks for listening my 50 year old Latino freind).

Hope you are having a nice weekend.  Happy Easter.  Wish you were thinking of me.  Wish you missed me as bad as I have.  Wish you cared.

On a happier note, i wrote another peom.  Its kind of a downer, but I like it.  Hope someone else will too.  Its short and not yet finished.  But ya know...

his plane takes off in an hour
and she is no where to be found.
what he doesnt know is
shes already off the ground.

high as a kite
in bed with another man
she never thought
she would do it again.

hes leaving for the summer
and shes no where to be seen
he never would have imagined
where she had been

hes always been there for her
when she needed him the most
but everytime that he needed her
she dissapeared like a ghost."

"event","Well, a great morning had by all.  Fights, spats and more arguements.  Why the hell for?  Nothing.  But i guess everything has a meaning and that means there was a reason for our fight this morning.  Was there?  you tell me.
You think that I have to be the one to initiate everything.  From hugs and kisses, to loving jestures to sex.  This is a relationship between two people.  We both have to initiate sometimes.  Why does is always have to be me to grab you and kiss you and just take you.  You wanted it too, so why can't you just take me, you know that i would return the kisses and love.  And why do i have to take your hand to say goodbye even after you already started walking away?  Do you want me to chase after you?  I dont know what you want me to do.  You walked away, what am i supposed to do?  That was another useless fight that could have been avoided.  
This relationship is a two way street, we both have to do a part to make it work.  But i guess you want me to do everything to make it work.
I forgot my book at your place this morning.  Can i come get it tonight?
I do love you, you know that.  But we both have to do things for each other, not just one of us.  You wanted something last night too, not just me.  I fell asleep while you were reading, all you had to do is wake me up.  Im ready for anything at any time.

"event","the lyrics in the songs i have been listening seem as if they are talking to me.  they tell me that we shouldnt be together.  everything points to us not being together.  everything is forcing us to split.  i dont want to be with anyone else.  i want to be with you.  i want you for myself. i dont want anyone else to have you or touch you, male of female.  im selfish.  i admit it, but i have a reason to be.  i have something that no one else does.  i have you.  I AM the luckiest guy in the world.  everyone who doesnt know our other side tells me.

sometimes i think that i would be fine without you but most of the time i know that i wouldnt.  i think that i would be ok if i found someone else but i know i wouldnt.  i dont want anyone else.  you are the one for me.  i think so anyways.  you have something no body else has.  theres something about you that draws me into you and makes me stay, no matter what happens.  i hate it sometimes, but i love it most of the time.  when we fight or spat, i want to leave but i can't because i want to stay with you so bad and work things out, or atleast try.  you have an intense aura about you, others have told me the same thing.

in the worst of times, i can still see being with you.  i want to be.  i want us to be ""soul mates"" again, whatever that means.  i want us to be the cute loving couple everyone gets sick of seeing.  we used to be.  you never used to be afraid of showing you affection for me around other ppl.  not hanging off me, but just showing you care and love me, anytime.  i have always let you know that i love you anytime, and i want ppl to know that we are in love and i am proud to show you off to anyone.  i would tell the whole world if i could.

like i said before, i think sometimes that i could be fine without you and i think that i can go on and find someone else.  but no one will ever take your place.  no one will ever fill the void that you ill have created after you are gone.  sometimes i would like to find someone else, but i dont really want to.  you know i want to be with you, you dont have to question that or question if i love you or not.  you know.

i want us to work out, you know i do. i want you for myself, sorry for feeling that way, but i dont want anyone to have you.  i want to protect what is mine, and im sure you do too.  you wouldnt want another girl googling over me or wanting me.  you wouldnt want another girl to tell me that they love me or miss me, yada yada yada.  

anyways, my few thoughts for the day.  maybe more will pop into my head"

"event","Danny Mainstreet kicked ass and he has the NICEST Gibson Les Paul i have ever seen in my life.  Smart wood.  So fuckin beautiful, i just wanna run my hands down the wood.  Also got a cd and a t-shirt (which i am wearing now) and i met the band.  Nice guys they are, but Ben supposedly ""loves the cock"".  And while i was talking to the singer, he gave me a free demo cd, which is pretty fuckin cool since it was free.

Well, the first band sucked balls but the did have a few cool riffs.  Mantra was fuckin incredible but would have been better if you could hear Ross's guitar a little more, maybe it was just where i was standing but it was good none the less.  I have decided that i am now going to get a nother tattoo.  A band around my wrist.  Ross's was so nice, i just have to have one now.
Hadrian 7 fuckin kicked ass didnt they?  Wow, the put on a great show.  The singer was playing a real nice PRS, silver all over with that fuckin kick as PRS headstock that makes me cream in my pants.  But the only bad thing about the guitar was it was only a single cut, if it were a double cut, it would be SO fuckin orgasmic i would have had to rip it off the guy and take it for my self as a souvenir.  The lead guitarist was really talented but he played guitar with his pointer and ring finger.  it looks kind of ugly but he was a great guitarist and he was playing an Ibanez.  I also bought Hadrain 7's cd, wise choice for only 5 bucks.

Now that the bands are done, how will i forget about the rest of my night?"

"event","Was my love for you a mistake
did you take it for granted
did you say that you loved me
and never really meant it

Do you really love me
or you just telling me a lie
i dont want to end this
but we have to say goodbye

I have always been true
and will be forever faithful.
But there seems to be other guys
and i guess im not able.

To give you everything you want
like i used to be
you have changed so much
i guess you need to be free.

But only from me and not him
hes gives you everything
and treats you perfectly.

Its time to move on with our lives
change what we have
and make things right.

I am not good enough for you anymore
and I know you wont stop me
as I walk out the door.

You were supposed to be mine
and i have always been yours
why can't i be the only one to have you?
Is anything sacred anymore?

Was our time together worth it
or was it just something to do waiting for time to pass?
Has everything we done meant nothing to you
because it sure felt like it has.

Did I really ever mean anything to you?
or was i just time killer?
Maybe just a person to lead on
and an empty space filler.

Your heart never really belonged to me
but mine has always belonged to you.
you hold it in the palm of your hand
and you are crushing it too."

"event","ever get the feeling that you know everything that you dont?  i moved down here just more than a month ago and everything seems so farmiliar even though its totally new to me.  everyone at work ive never met before and yet it seems like ive known them my whole life.  same way with new music i have been hearing.  i feel like i have heard it all before even though it was just released a few days ago or i never had downloaded the band before.  and movies are the same way too.  i watched Saw the other night and could have swore that i have seen it before even though i had no idea was was about to happen.

i have been having alot of deja vu lately.  i was sitting at a co-workers house watching tv and could swear that i have been in that situation or dreampt it already.

this city is alot smaller than i expected too.  people that i talk to know where i am from and where i used to live and know people from oxford and surrounding areas.  a girl i was talking to recently has freinds and relatives that have a cottage at heathers beach and she knows where my cottage is when i explained it to her.  and a guy i work with also has relatives from oxford that i know. what a small fuckin city this really is.

this goes to you.  you are perfect to me, you know that, i make sure you know that.  you are everything that i have ever wanted and ever needed and more.  no one has what you have and no one can compare to you.  you are what i want.  you have what i want.  you have everything.  i wish i could tell you all of my thoughts and feelings but when i try i blank and screw up an dyou end up mad and upset.  i just want to explain how i feel but i never can.  i can never find the words.  i do love you.  i always have and always will.  i have lots to tell you....please be understanding."

we had fun while it lasted.
Goodbye, nice to know you
you went away and never came back.

We had some good times and bad
but we always pulled through.
I loved you since i first met you
and it was just me and you.

But problems arose
and we fought all the time.
Who knew you would drop
our relationship, on a dime.

I still love you
and i just want you to know
that I cried like a baby
and didn't really want you to go.

I said that I hated you
but you could tell it was a lie
you said you hated me too
and wished me to die.

I never thought
 that we would end so bad
and when it did
 we held nothing back.

All of our pent up anger and hatred
flew from their cages
You hit me and called me names
and all the time we spent together had been wasted

In the beginning you said you would love me forever
and never leave my side
you said we would be together
until the day we died.

From what you just told me
our whole relationship was a lie
but I meant everything i ever said
from the first time i said ""Hi""

You walked out of my life
and never gave a second glance
But to fight for me and to keep me
you would never take the chance.

You are gone and my life is over 
I am writing this down in hopes
that you will remember

All that we have done
and all that we have gone through
you said you and fun
 and I did too

I am ending my life
because now i have nothing to hide
I meant it when i told you
I would love you until the day I die.

I still love you.
Goodbye beautiful

Goodbye, nice to know you
we had fun while it lasted.
Goodbye, nice to know you
you went away and never came back."

"event","Its funny how I(me, matt oickle), could miss home and be homesick.  its fuckin wierd.  i hated home so much and couldnt wait to get away, but when i did get away, i miss home and family and relatives.  it seems that everytime i leave home, something happens.  Nan had an operation on her throat just after i left, and i come to find out that my grandfather may have cancer, but were not sure.

I miss my family.  I do.  I do love them and miss them.  We all got a little closer when i left.  We all played cards together like a family and talked.  It was nice.  I will never forget the look on my parents faces the day i left.  Mom had to go to work, so she left before i did.  But she gave me a few last minute groceries and a hug and we both cried.  I didnt think leaving home would be so hard.  She started to cry as i gave her a hug goodbye and i just couldnt help myself and i did too.  Just happened.  Im such a big fuckin sap.  And when i went to say goodbye to dad, i put my shoes on, he just went out the door, so i followed before he could get too far and i said goodbye.  Thats the first time i've ever seen my dad cry like that.  I guess it was bad at my grandfathers funeral, but this was really bad too.  I hugged him and we both started to cry.  Hes such a big fuckin sap too lol.  We said our goodbyes and we both laughed at us crying lol...good times.   I do miss them.  More than I expected.

I miss all my relatives.  I miss Nan and Gramp, and Maim and Gramp(god rest your soul).  My grandfather died this summer on the same night as my cousins wedding.  I was at a movie in amherst.  The drive home was the longest drive ever.  I knew something had happened even though i didnt actually know.  I miss all the good times with my family and relatives.  I can remember growing up with all my relatives.  I can remember memories from ALL of them, and all were good.  Too many to write down here, but i remember.

I miss my old freinds.  I miss Nick and all the jam sessions we had with Y.E.L.B in Shawns trailor and all the movies that I paid for.  Good times are missed.

To everyone i left behind, i still love you all and miss you.  Especially tonight.  Something came over me.  I just got really sappy all of a sudden and every little memory comes flooding back.  I think of all our memories and everything you taught me and what you made me.  I am what you made me and i love you all for it.

My aunt Betty taught me ""i have two hands, i need a treat for each one"" and to say ""Ahhhh"" after taking a sip of a drink.  My cousin Anne and Julie dressed me up as a punk rocker one year and a pumkin the next year for halloween.  I have pictures. lol.  My uncle Bob taught me how to play pool...i still suck, but he taught me.....then my dad whooped his ass hardcore.  My dad is a fuckin pool shark!!! (which is really quite amusing and wierd)  My grandfather (grandpa Oickle) taught me how to make saurcraught (that how you spell it?) and watched me chop off the end of my finger....like two minutes after my dad told me ""watch out for your fingers, dont get em too close, you will chop em off"".....so i did.   One summer, my nan, me and my best freind from the beach all made sand sculptures for a contest and put Hot Lips on the mouth of an alligator....we won....a HUGE bookbag full of Pepsi and a HUMONGOUS Sprite rubber dingy, it was fuckin awesome. (i still have the dingy)

Anyways, enough memories to bore everyone.  I will keep the rest to myself.

Fond memories of everyone back in Oxford.  I love you."

"event","well, last nigth sucked.  my car wouldnt start so i couldnt go over to jonathons and hang with alison and play the Ironbird or watch the movie she rented or dl, one or the other.  So i sat home and downloaded music and learned a couple new songs.  yay.  this morning also kinda sucked.  i called home and talked for a while.  mandy is doing ok with basketball and her team one the tournament yesterday.  i shoulda went home last night, my parents are cooking a turkey now and i also found out that my grandfather has a lump on his lung.  they doctors arent sure if its cancer yet and he has to go in for treatment and radiation therapy and shit.  that fuckin sucks.  im should probably vacuum soon, but its cold and im lazy.  hopefully there will be no work for me tomorow and the mall will be closed.
fuckin snow, i love it in so many ways, and then there is the few reasons it fuckin sucks.  i was supposed to see allison today to talk and shit, but that got screwed over because of kent being down for the fuckin weekend.  yippee.  i was really looking forward to it too.  oh well, shit happens like usual.
im starting to get tired of waiting for her to be ready to come back to me.  i want to be with you and all, but it fuckin sucks when you move and change your life to be with someone and they want to go on a break and be ""just freinds"".  oh well, shit happens.....i guess shit happens alot to me eh?
i also found out that i might be moving home again.  there is a job at the Oxford Journal that i would love to have, but the only qualifications that i dont really have is Macintosh OS abilities.  im sure its probably easy as hell and i could do it no problem, but they more than likely wont even look at me if i dont have Macintosh qualities.  oh well.  the graphics design and newpaper layout would have been fun, and the hours were fuckin aweosme, all morning shifts until like 4 pm.  perfect.  now if i can just find a job down here like that and i would be all set.
heres another entry for you.  connected again?  its not like we were ""connected"" in the first place.  oh well...yada yada..(you know the saying)"

"event","thoughts, images and memories came flooding back to me last night as i went to bed.  its surprising that i can remember alot of shit from my childhood growing up.  maybe its because i still miss home and want to go back home because there is nothing here in hali for me anymore.  maybe its because i miss the old days when things were simple.

i remember an easter when i was like 5 or 6 and i had a bad ear ache and was really sick and i got a He-Man toy and some clothes and a chocolate easter egg.  every easter i would get a hollow chocolate easter egg with my name on it.  it was awesome.  
i remember when i was little and i had a freind at the beach that stayed at the cottage next to my nan's, his name was Johny and he was deaf.  i still have pictures of us together.
i remember all through elementary and highschool the times that kids beat me up and when i got in fights and who i fought.
i remember danny.  an awesome freind of mine.  he was killed on a three-wheeler crossing the highway in september in grade 8.  i still miss him.
i can still remember all the bad times growing up and i still remember all the good times.  i remember when me and howie started hanging out and i remember when me and nick started hanging out.  howie fuckin broke my walkman at the exhibition one summer and i went over to nicks and we played with jurassic park toys and played nintendo.
i remember my first job.  i worked next door to my house and mowed lawns and pulled weeds and painted and all that shit.  and i remember all the good times at the irving and all the laughs and drunken christmas parties.
i remember my trip to quebec with holly.  we had started hanging out at the first of grade twelve and i developed a crush on her.  we were the only ones at the end of the year who still wanted to go, so we had one room for the both of us and we shared a bed.  drunk the whole time we were there, it was awesome.  the bars were amazing.  i also started liking allison alot that year.  more than anyone i have ever had a crush on.  i should have called her when i was in quebec to say hello.  i missed her and wanted to talk to her.
i remember all the summers at the beach with ""the penny lane gang"".  me, alicia, jonathon, jarred, nikki and brad.  we were together every day we were at the beach from the moment we woke to the time we went to bed.  we were all inseperable.  best freinds forever.  those were the best summers of my life.  at the cottage.
i remember my first trip to newfoundland to visit relatives.  i hung out with cousins down the road my my great aunts, jillian and andrew.  they were awesome.  by the time i left i was taking on the newfoundland accent....to bad i was extremely shitt at it.

i also remember the first time i met you.  at your previous boyfreinds house.  i grabbed your ass when you gave me a hug.  i should have knew that you were the huggie type the first time i talked to you.  i went over to howie's to see what was goin on and you and him were upstairs.....without shirts on...that was great.  so he led me downstairs really quick and you came down afterwards and said hey and gave me a hug...and i grabbed your ass.
i remember our first kiss.  on your front step, short but sweet....to me anyways.  i remember our first passionate kiss.  standing, looking out your picture window that faces the river.  it was snowing and i came and wrapped my hands around you and kissed your head and you turned around and kissed me back.
i remember all the times that we almost got caught doing stuff.  under your blanket with all the holes in it completely nude when your dad walks in and makes a snack.
i remember the time that i kept you in my room and tried to make you stay but your dad wanted you home.  i remember all the times we did stuff on your couch and in your bed.
i remember the drive we took out to collingwood and just talked and you asked me about krystin and what we had done together.
i remember the first time we parked and were caught.  a mercury cougar drove by when we were sitting there and we both panicked.
i want to go back to Liscomb and to Sherbrooke Village.  i had an amazing time.  the resort was nice as hell.  we stayed up late playing chess and drinking.  and we went to the games room in the rain and played air hockey and foozeball and pool.  we went to the pool and swam for a while and went to the sauna.  and i did stuff to you.  good times.  i remember the drive there and the drive back.  on the way there, we stopped to pee on the side of the road and just as you zipped up your pants again a car drove by.
i remember all of our camping trips.  to wentworth and five islands.  we got drunk together most of the times we went.  and i remember the night we camped out at the beach on my nan's nieghbor's lawn.  drunk again hanging with my relatives.
i remember the first time we did ""stuff"".  my house in little river.  i was completely calm for being my first time ever and you were nervous as hell.
i remember alot more than you think i do.  i miss all of our good times and have forgotten all about our bad times.  i could write 2000 word essay on all of the things we have done over the years, but i wont.  no one needs to hear them all and probably didnt need to read any of this."

Anyways, me and my buddy, Nick (the drummer who looks like Vinnie Paul...this is gonna be ironic lol) went to a concert...a Pantera concert in Halifax.  it was awesome.  the concert was fuckin cool and i got to meet Dimebag and Vinnie.  Dimebag showed me some stuff on guitar and autographed a cd for me.  Dimebag was playing the Rebel Flag Starfish and Vinnie was playing his awesome  brick colored drum kit.  Afterwards, Dimebag made me a security gaurd on the tour bus.  How fuckin cool is that???

"event","It was supposed to be better,
as soon as i got to you,
but im still feeling lonely,
abandoned and used.

You said you would love me forever,
and that things would never change,
but recently ive been neglected,
and youve been acting really strange.

I know you have work to do,
and you have your own life to live,
but you always want to take,
and never want to give.

I try to do as much as i can for you,
and i dont ask for alot,
but i do send some signals,
and you rarely ever respond.

When you want something,
you get it right away,
but when i want something,
i have to wait for days.

I never know when i will see you next,
so i always sit by the phone,
hoping you will call me,
so i dont have to be alone.

Many times ive wanted to end it,
because you just dont seem to care,
but i always want to be with you,
and to end it I could not bare.

I want to be with you forever,
you know this it is true,
but for once i would like for you to show me,
that you actually love me too."

"event","Xmas sucked this year. Me and Ally fought like crazy, which im not gonna talk about because everyone probably already knows and its just me being a fuckhead and screwing everything up, and it didnt snow...until the day after...son of a bitch!  It started snowing while we were playing badminton.  What an awesome night of badminton too by the way.  I actually got to play a game with Ally AND against her.  That was great, i've been looking forward to it for a while and was really hoping we could.
Got alot of nice gifts this year...except something im gonna need.....money.  Its gonna be a little tight until i get a job, anyone know of anyone hiring?  Allison got me all of the Metallica actions figures  (thank-you), some nice clothes, lots of chocolate, a big ass Lego truck, a really nice sketch pad that Lisa might like, and a DVD/VCR.
No snow is bad snow, but usually only for Christmas.  It started snowing the day after...goddammit.  Now im stuck at home...alone without allison and shes headed to P.E.I in the morning, hopefully she will call before she leaves in the morning.  But on the good side, my buddy Matt from school is coming on the 29th for the night.  Havent seen him in a while, its gonna be a good time.
Can't wait for Billy Talent!!! Gonna be awesome, wish everyone could go.  GET YOUR TICKETS!!!  Goin down on the 31st with most of my stuff, which i packed today, and gonna drop it off before the concert, but im leaving my guitar at home.  Hopefully i will get a jam or two in with Nick before he leaves.  BTW, anyone want to buy a Jay Turser Explorer in perfect condition for $400?  It sounds fuckin awesome!!!
Maybe Lisa will like my drawings and sketches...hopefully, i've seen some of her stuff and shes quite talented!  But then again, she will probably tell me whats wrong with it like some ppl do, but then again, she may like some and give me a few tips.
Oh! and does anyone know of anyone wanting to start a band?
I think i might watch Moulin Rouge too Allison!"

"event","I should have stayed at Allisons last night!  grr what a piss off.  everytime a catastraphe like this happens, im stuck at my house.  sonofabitch!  last year it snowed three times as hard..and i was here.  it flooded in my first year of college so i went to allisons on my way home.. she wasnt there so i went home...and got stuck there for the damn night.  everytime!!  why does shit like that happen to me? cant anything go my way?  dammit!
so yeah, i slept in until 3:30 today, and talked to allison for a while around 12:30, it was nice.  wish i could see her today, but ya know.  watched Serving Sara, and saw her in her underwear....now im horny and have no release... :(   seeing elizabeth hurley in panties would do that to pretty much any guy, but seeing her makes me think of allison and how sexy she is.  and elizabeth hurley doesnt even come close to how sexy allison is!!! no sirree bob!
mmm allison in underwear....mmmm...sexy  *drool* *drool*
anyways, allison, if you get this, i love you and miss you like crazy, and i wish you were here.  i wish you had a webcam!  thats what i shoulda got you for xmas!

"event","want to know whats on my mind?  you want to tell you whats on my mind?  you always do, but you never really care anyways.  either you never listen and change the subject and drop what were talking about or you get mad or pissed off because i actually have a reason to be upset.  sorry for ever being upset.  your right, i dont have anything to be upset over, i never really do do i?  
sorry for ruining your weekend.  sorry for ruining everyday i am with you.  im surprised you havent broken up with me already too.  sorry for all the ""fighting"".  sorry for just wanting to be with you on my ""special"" day.  i dont care what we do, as long as im with you!  sorry for that incredibly crappy drive to the movie.  i wasnt upset until you assumed i was.  you always do.  i was fine.  we were talking about my future and money and jobs, and all of a sudden you think im mad at you for bringing it up?  i wanted to talk to you about it! anyways, sorry for ruining everything for you.  like always.  i always ruin everything.  sorry for ruining my day for you, and sorry i didnt know what to do or where to go.  maybe its because no one even cares anyways?  more than likely.  actually, absolutely!

anyways, on to a new topic.  something else that ""isnt"" bothering me.  sorry kent, but i gotta badmouth you one more time.   whats with being pissed off because she puts you second after me?  well yeah, you would think so! duh!  shes my girlfreind, not yours!  and no one understands why i dont like you very much! would you want your girlfreind to put another guy before you? dont think so mister!
question for anyone who wants to answer:
  1 -  would you want your girlfreind/boyfreind hanging around with another guy/girl, talking about this person all the time to you and everyone else, going to movies with them, or talking to him/her all the time even when your with them?
  2 - would you be pissed off if another guy/girl had a huge crush on your girlfreind/boyfreind and got pissed off or upset when they couldnt see her/him?
  3 - would you be curious to anything going on with your girlfreind/boyfreind and this other person?
  4 - would you feel like a third party in the relationship if your girlfreind/boyfreind had a a freind like that?
  5 - would you be pissed off if you girlfreind/boyfreind ended a call by telling the other person ""hugs"" with or without you around?

please, someone answer my questions, i need someone elses opinion on this.  no one seems to understand me in this.
so there ya go kent, sorry to bash ya, but i had to do it, sorry.  she would probably rather be with you anyways, and everyone else would rather her be with someone else!
my two cents for the night!   thank you live journal for being there for me when i needed someone to talk to!  I love you LJ!"

"event","Dimebag is dead!!!
I cant believe it!!! The best guitarist in the world was shot wednesday night on stage.  Some fucker jumped on staged and blasted five rounds into him and then killed three other people before he was killed himself.
Thats fuckin sad.  Pantera rules, Damageplan is OK, but the point is, Dimebag is fuckin God!!  Dead at 38 years old.  I got home from work and popped online to see whats up and a freinds Messenger name said it all.  Of course i had to check it out before i believed it....there it was, headlines!!!  Ex-Pantera guitarist gunned-down.   What a fuckin shame.
My absolute favorite guitarist..gone forever.  I was in shock, and still am.  Almost started crying because it hit me so hard.  It feels like i've lost a close freind and buddy.
We will miss you Diamond/Dimebag Darrel Abbot, and we love you.  This 40 on the curb goes to you.  God rest your soul.  We will remember you. You will be in our hearts forever.

"event","ever get that feeling that everyone around you is thinking that you are useless and are about as good as a piece of dried shit?  try living with my mother.
i came home from work today at 1 oclock, with a migraine and not feeling the best.  she comes home around 4:30 and asked why i was home.  i told her.  as soon as i did, she started into me....like usual.  ""made alot of money today didnt you?""  stupid bitch.  anyways, i sitting at the computer at 6:00, and she comes down the stairs and lays a strip again, for no reason. i was sitting minding my own business, and then BOOM!!!  ""your some lazy! why dont you get out and find a job.  your aunt june hasnt been on the schedule all week, but shes been working steady.  i would think that a boy your age would want to work and make money and move out.  get a life why dont ya?""  fuck you bitch, you say you want me out, but you contradict yourself and give me all the downsides to moving out and how hard its gonna be, i thought you wanted me the fuck out???.  christ.
fell like a piece of shit, eh?  she fuckin tells me every chance she gets, and she wonders why im never home.  would you want to be home listening to that all fuckin day?  no!  im fuckin tempted to get a shower and go to halifax for the weekend right now, i dont care if allison isnt home, i will sleep in my car for the night.  at least when i am with her, i feel a little loved and not like a piece of fermented crap.
and the bitch upstairs says i have the perfect life.  she ""gives me everything, we have two fourwheelers, a tractor, a cottage, you have a car...yada yada yada, blah blah blah""  fuck off!!! nothing means anything if your not happy cunt!  and guess what....im not happy!!!!!  you think i should be, but listening to you bitch and complain all the fuckin time...and you wonder why im always cranky around you....DUH!!!!  anyways, im done bitching for now, this is one of the times you really could use a cigarette.  im thinkin its a good idea since im in such a pissy mood and my mother is a bitch"

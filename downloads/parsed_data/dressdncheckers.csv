"event","i am loving this rain more than i can even begin to express. i love waking up with it, i love going to sleep with it. i love driving in it, i love walking in it, i love standing in it. i love hearing it. i love being surrounded by it. i love seeing it. i love being outside at just the right time to experience it go from barely sprinkling to pouring. 

i really don't think i could get sick of being around rain. everyone always says&quot; oh yeah but you'd get sick of it real fast&quot; but i don't know. i feel the people who tend to say this to me are the people who say they like the rain but really only when they aren't doing anything and they actually prefer heat and sun.

i hate heat, i hate sun, and i hate when it's not raining. 

of course i wouldn't want it to rain every single day but i would not mind having real winters and real summers. 

seriously. i've gotta get out of LA!"

it's so weird to actually have this small light of hope and faith in our government after so long of feeling like the world was coming to an end. 

i really hope that barack obama can fulfill all of our hopes and expectations. and i know he is&nbsp;up to the task. He says, &quot;...part of what I'm hoping to introduce as the next president is a new ethic of responsibility.&quot;

my heart swells, my eyes tear and i feel a new beginning coming on.

it's still hard to believe. and it's still hard to reconcile this new found pride for a country i previously had so much disdain for."

I can't hear the songs he sings 
All the jewels in heaven 
They don't look the same to me 

I just wade the tides that turned 
Till I learn to leave the past behind 

It's only lies that I'm living 
It's only tears that I'm crying 
It's only you that I'm losing 
Guess I'm doing fine 

All the battlements are empty 
And the moon is laying low 
Yellow roses in the graveyard 
Got no time to watch them grow 

Now I bade a friend farewell 
I can do whatever pleases me 

It's only lies that I'm living 
It's only tears that I'm crying 
It's only you that I'm losing 
Guess I'm doing fine 

Press my face up to the window 
To see how warm it is inside 
See the things that I've been missing 
Missing all this time 

It's only lies that I'm living 
It's only tears that I'm crying 
It's only you that I'm losing 
Guess I'm doing fine"

I swear half of those $40 fucking shirts i bought were sewen incorrectly, like against the bias or something so the shirt twists when it shouldn't. it happens alot with crappy jeans, and usually happens when they want to save money and use as much fabric as possible... i forget all the technical terms but for an expensive ass&nbsp;unfinished ""t""shirt you would think they could at least just cut the fabric correctly.&nbsp;<br />im really beginning to resent shopping at american apparel...<br /><br />actually, they call it a dress and it's not $40, it's $30, but it's still a rip off.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i.americanapparel.net/storefront/images/detail/serve.asp?media=2386_AsphaltA.jpg"" />&nbsp;although i guess not really since i wear them practically everyday and i'm wearing that exact one right now... anyways, it's just that i could make it in like 10 minutes and for a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />3. build Gato a scratching post, lounger thingy such as...<br />this! <img alt="""" src=""http://www.catsplay.com/pc01s.jpg"" /><br />or more realistically...<br />this: <img alt="""" src=""http://www.catsplay.com/minicattrees.jpg"" /><br />all i would need is some wood, some carpet, some heavy duty glue, a staple gun,&nbsp;a drill and some giant screws&nbsp;and some of this thick ass rope. that's gotta cost me less than the $300 heart one. my dad should have some of the supplies and i may be able to get pieces of carpet for free from behind some carpet place (scraps and stuff).&nbsp;<br /><br />4. i also need to start my garden. i figure it's so late in the summer growing season that i probably won't be able to get much besides flowers but that would be nice anyways. give me two weeks, i'll be gardening!"

"event","i'm volunteering at a <a href=""http://www.straycatclub.org/"">masquerade party</a> for the stray cat&nbsp;alliance that neutered orangeman,&nbsp;and after my volunteer hours i get free admission to the party which includes delicious vegan food, an open gin bar and a silent auction. this is&nbsp;all awesome, but im going to be all alone because i had signed up first and told andrea and she still had to fitgure out whether or not she could do it. but then i forgot that there was a deadline to sign up as a volunteer and she forgot and now i think it's too late for her to sign up.<br /><br />i think it will still be fun, but drinking alone and eating alone will get pretty lame, pretty fast...<br /><br />and ew, judie mancuso is one of the sponsor's and she's one of the main people who was pushing for the bill to be passed requiring all animals be spayed and neutered or else you get fined.<br /><br />believe me, i want the kitties to be spayed and neutered as much as the next person but i firmly believe that if that had passed ALOT of animals wouldn't have gotten the care they need lest the owners be slapped with a $500 fine for not getting their animal fixed. it also didn't&nbsp; help that along with the bill they weren't trying to offer any sort of affordable spaying and neutering so people could actually afford to get their animals fixed when they have kittens. i think it was a totally backwards act, and would have hurt more animals than helped them.&nbsp;<br /><br />perhaps if they offered lowcost or even free spaying and neutering for pets then it would get done more often. but what are you supposed to do when you can't afford it in the first place, then the cat gets pregnant, has even more kittens and then you REALLY can't afford it because there are too many. uugghhh.&nbsp;<br /><br />anyways. im excited, but sad now at the same time."

"event","gato has been acting very lethargic and wierd this past week, and i noticed he has a big lump under his chin so after speaking with several people and a few vets i've decided to take him in. i really hope it turns out to be nothing. i love him so much, i want him to be safe and healthy!! i'm going to cross my fingers and hope that it's nothing and won't be terribly expensive. my coworker took her dog in because he has a growth on his leg and it cost her $678 just for the tests!&nbsp;

"event","well yesterday was my first day of school at ucla as well as&nbsp;my two year anniversary with hunter.&nbsp;<br /><br />it was a pretty chill day. my classes will be challenging and alot&nbsp;of work but thankfully i only have one paper to do for all of my classes so that will greatly reduce the amount of stress i have to endure this quarter (or so i hope). papers&nbsp;really kick my ass and the one paper&nbsp;i have to do is for my communication and conflict class so it shouldn't be&nbsp;that difficult&nbsp;and it will be on a topic i get to choose.<br /><br />i've decided to stay in the fundamentals of learning class. i spoke with the teacher and he said that the only statistics i need to know for the class are basic things like how to read a graph and the basic stat stuff, and i&nbsp;figure i already know it&nbsp;from taking that stats class at el camino and i could always&nbsp;meet with the GSI from&nbsp;the stats class i have now. it is a really fascinating topic and while it's going to be an intense class in the amount of studying i have to do, i feel that my statistics class is going to be harder because i suck at math like that.&nbsp;<br /><br />my&nbsp;statistics teacher was&nbsp;trying to describe this basic probability issue and i was totally lost. he wrote some crap on the board and it was NONSENSE!!! i wish i&nbsp;would have taken a picture of it so i could post it on here because it was SERIOUSLY nonsensical. he said ""ok, so we have 8 doors here"" and then he&nbsp;drew a circle, wrote a D above it and made some squiggly lines beside it. then at one point&nbsp;he wrote 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 but his 5 looked like a fucking T with a teeny teeny teeny tiny little bend in it on the bottom. &nbsp;i hope he doesn't write on the board often because what he wrote made me feel like i was&nbsp;on mushrooms and trying to study&nbsp;or something because it made NO sense to me in any way shape or form. i think he was trying to write a Y but it looked more like the japanese&nbsp;katakana symbol for Ri (<img height=""21"" alt="""" width=""28"" src=""http://www.manchaca.com/~sradowski/japanese/kana/kri.gif"" />) than a Y, and i don't even know why he was writing a y because he wasn't talking about mean scores or anything, he was still talking about the fucking 8 doors. and he's white, not japanese.&nbsp;<br /><br />anyways, it was incredibly confusing. so im pretty worried about this class. the teacher is funny, in fact all of my teachers are really funny so that's nice. they don't seem incredibly intimidating as i thought they would. i am really excited.<br /><br />so now i have 5 chapters to read for my statistics class, a few to read for my communication and conflict class and some for my learning class.... by tuesday. i am so excited! hunter is coming in tonight for the weekend, but he has papers to write so we can sit and work on school stuff together and that is totally fine by me. i just want to be able to touch him. I AM SO EXCITED!!<br /><br />now i have to clean this massive mess i have in the house. i've got lots of stuff to do today. it is so nice being busy now after having absolutely NOTHING to do for months on end."

"event","i just finished watching the third act of spike lee's ""when the levees broke,"" the documentary about hurricane katrina&nbsp;and wow. god. it had me sobbing. my heart is breaking for all of these poor people...&nbsp; 

there is so much i could say about the bush administration, about the failure of our government and all that... but i think we've&nbsp;heard it all and i just suggest watching the documentary. 

but i do have to say... 

the bush family are satan's spawn, if satan were in fact to be real. the nerve of barbara fucking bush. that stupid fucking heartless bitch. to say that the people in the astrodome and superdome were better off than they were originally&nbsp;in their homes, with their families and loved ones... to try to act as though it's better for them to be sleeping on a fucking cot worrying about being robbed and raped in the night is sickening. has she no perspective, has she no ability to think about the trauma and nightmare these people have gone through? AUGH!&nbsp; 

this is a direct quote from barbara bush taken from video footage: 
&nbsp;""what im hearing which is sort of scary is they all wanna stay in texas. Everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality and so many of the people in the arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway. this is working very well for them."" 

HELLO YOU FUCKING IDIOT. besides her fear (""which is sort of scary"") that was probably fueled by racism and ignorance, she seems to lack any knowledge whatsoever on the conditions in new orleans. did she miss the memo or&nbsp;something?&nbsp;they want to stay in texas because there is NOTHING for them in new orleans. they have no houses, no schools, no hospitals, no stores, no work. im sure they all want to go back home but there is little they can do there without the resources and assistance they need to rebuild their lives and their communities.&nbsp;

let me just say also that i will give her a bit of a chance and hope that her fear of the people being in houston was out of concern for there not being enough resources to sustain the influx&nbsp;and not&nbsp;out of racism but i really truly doubt it. i have no faith in that family. 

people keep talking about how they wonder about the ethics of the clinton family because of bills infidelity and yet i don't hear anybody questioning the moral integrity of the bush family and their utter lack of compassion and concern for human lives!!! getting your dick sucked is not even in the same realm as the insensitive bullshit barbara bush comes spewing out with. she raised her children with those morals and that fucked up heart and look at the fucking president we have today. 

im sick."

"event","UCLA orientation was on thursday last week. it was a MAJOR waste of time. i was supposed to go to all these workshops on different topics but ended up not being able to attend ANY of them, and eventually just left two hours early. the only good thing was that i got a bit of guidance on what classes to choose but it really didn't even matter in the end anyways because i just picked classes that could fit my schedule. oh yeah and i got my bruincard which is pretty sweet.

so my schedule is:
Tuesday/Thursday
8am-9:15am- Fundamentals of Learning
11am-12:15pm- Earth and Its Physical Environment
12:30pm-1:45pm- Communication and Conflict in Families and Couples

Tuesday
2pm-3:50pm- Earth and Its Physical Environment Lab

Monday
9am-9:50am- Fundamentals of Learning Discussion

I am most excited about my communication and conflict class, seeing as how that's what my main focus is because i want to be a marriage/family therapist.

i can't wait to start school. i cant wait at all! it's so exciting!

now i have to go clear up my cal grant issues. they are trying to dick me out of my grant!!"

"event","<p>AUGH! i was just about to go have a grilled cheese sandwich made with the beautifully organic, exceedingly delicious&nbsp;and cruelty free smoked cheddar cheese i bought at the farmers market two weeks ago and it's covered with mold. you see, it would be no problem if i had a giant 3 inch thick piece, but no. i spent 7 fucking dollars on this 1 inch thick, and 3 inch tall piece of cheese and you have to cut an inch off all sides of the cheese to ensure that you aren't eating the moldy part. i think i ate about 3 dollars worth of it. next time im making them cut that shit smaller if it's going to get moldy so fucking fast.&nbsp;<br /><br />you don't understand <a href=""http://www.springhillcheese.com/about.html"">how DELICIOUS this cheese was</a>. the cows that produced the milk actually EAT GRASS!! not grain, not feed, not mash, not hormones, not ground up pieces of other animals, not corn but what they are naturally SUPPOSED to eat: <a href=""http://www.deliciousorganics.com/Controversies/grassfed.htm"">GRASS</a>&nbsp;and try to deny it all you want, but there is a definite difference in the flavor of that cheese. it is seriously AMAZING. i made grilled cheese sandwiches with it on these fresh slices of ciabatta bread... made crispy with vegan butter... oh god it was beyond heaven. i am so sad that the cheese is ruined.</p><p>fyi: http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/CheeseMold.htm<br /><br /><font face=""Verdana"">Molds are used to make certain kinds of cheeses and can be on the surface of cheese or be developed internally. Blue veined cheese such as Roquefort, blue, Gorgonzola, and Stilton are created by the introduction of <i>P. roqueforti</i> or <i>Penicillium roqueforti</i> spores. Cheeses such as Brie and Camembert have white surface molds. Other cheeses have both an internal and a surface mold. The molds used to manufacture these cheeses are safe to eat. </font></p><blockquote><p><font face=""Verdana""><b>Hard cheese</b> (not cheese where mold is part of the processing) - If the mold is not too much, just cut it off. Cut off at least 1 inch around and below the mold spot (keep the knife out of the mold itself so it will not cross-contaminate other parts of the cheese). After trimming off the mold, re-cover the cheese in fresh wrap. Mold generally cannot penetrate deep into the product.</font></p><b><p><font face=""Verdana"">Cheese made with mold </font></p><b><p><font face=""Verdana"">Soft cheese </font></p><b><p><font face=""Verdana"">Yogurt and sour cream - </font></p></b><font face=""Verdana"">Discard.<b> </b>Foods with high moisture content can be contaminated below the surface. Moldy foods may also have bacteria growing along with the mold.</font></b><font face=""Verdana"">(such as cottage, cream cheese, Neufchatel, chevre, Bel Paese, etc.) - Discard. Foods with high moisture content can be contaminated below the surface. Shredded, sliced, or crumbled cheese can be contaminated by the cutting instrument. Moldy soft cheese can also have bacteria growing along with the mold.</font></b><font face=""Verdana"">(such as Roquefort, blue, Gorgonzola, Stilton, Brie, Camembert) - Discard soft cheeses such as Brie and Camembert if they contain molds that are not a part of the manufacturing process. If surface mold is on hard cheeses such as Gorgonzola and Stilton, cut off mold at least 1 inch around and below the mold spot and handle like hard cheese (above). Molds that are not a part of the manufacturing process can be dangerous.</font></blockquote><p><font face=""Verdana"" color=""#ff0000""><strong>People with mold allergy often are advised by their doctors to avoid eating mold-ripened cheese and restrict themselves to processed cheeses.</strong></font></p>"

He gets on the bus in front of a row of 1950s semi-detached houses and jumps off at a row of shops down the road which include a fish and chip shop. </p><p>Driver Bill Khunkhun, 49, who first saw the cat jumping from the bus in January, said: ""It is really odd, the first time I saw the cat jumping off the bus with a group of passengers. I hadn't seen it get on which was a bit confusing. </p><p>""The next day I pulled up on Churchill Road to let a couple of passengers on. As soon as I opened the doors the cat ran towards the bus, jumped on and ran under one of the seats, I don't think any of the passengers noticed. </p><p>""Because I had seen it jump off the day before I carried on driving and sure enough when I stopped just down the road he jumped off - I don't know why he would catch the bus but he seems to like it. I told some of the other drivers on this route and they have seen him too."" </p><p>Since January, when the cat first caught the bus he has done it two or three times a week and always gets on and off at the same stops. </p><p>Passenger, Paul Brennan, 19, who catches the 331 to work, said: ""I first noticed the cat a few weeks ago. At first I thought it had been accompanied by its owner but after the first stop it became quite clear he was on his own. </p><p>""He sat at the front of the bus, waited patiently for the next stop and then got off. It was was quite strange at first but now it just seems normal. I suppose he is the perfect passenger really - he sits quietly, minds his own business and then gets off."" </p>"

It also bothered me that the guy i talked to told me that one guy had the three year warranty and that at about year 2.5 his laptop screen started having white spots, but since his model was ""so outdated"" they didn't have any parts to fix it, they instead had to replace the whole damn thing. yeah, it may be nice to get a whole new computer but if within only 2 years my laptop is prehistoric, breaking down&nbsp;and can't possibly be fixed unless i pay for the ""wonderful"" three year warranty, i don't think it's really worth it. what happens after 3 years when my computer fucks up? i lose a whole 1.2 g's because nobody has the technology to fix it anymore? yeah, no thanks.<br /><br />i understand that technology is constantly updating and things go out of style, usage, whatever, REAL quick, but at least with a pc they can open it up and change some shit here and there and get you back into the present, right? is that the same with laptops?<br /><br />so im back to looking at pc's. still considering dell because they sent me a 25% off offer in my email today... but not quite sure. i know absolutely nothing about computers and im so afraid of getting a shitty deal. i am not going to have this sort of money to dish out on a laptop again for probably many many many many many many years so if im going to get a laptop it has to be good, reliable and totally worth it.<br /><br />do you guys have any tips? any warnings/suggestions? i'm looking at the $800-$1200 range, hopefully including everything like a printer/virus protection/microsoft office, etc. and yes, it HAS to be a laptop, im going to be too mobile to be chained down by wires, mouses and keyboards.</p>"

 </script><div class=""firstP"">One week after retired NBA player John Amaechi publically identified himself as gay, retired Heat guard Tim Hardaway said on a Miami radio show that he would not want to play with a gay man.</div><p>&nbsp;</p>""You know, I hate gay people, so I let it be known,"" Hardaway said Wednesday, according to a transcript on the <i>Miami Herald</i> Web site. ""I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States."" <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hardaway was a guest on the show and was asked at the end of the interview how he would handle having a gay teammate. </p><p>''First of all, I wouldn't want him on my team,'' Hardaway answered. ""And second of all, if he was on my team, I would really distance myself from him because I don't think that is right. I don't think he should be in the locker room while we are in the locker room. But stuff like that is going on and there's a lot of other people I hear that are like that and still in the closet and don't want to come out of the closet, but you know I just leave that alone.'' </p><p>Hardaway doesn't think he's alone in that view, either. </p><p>''Something has to give,'' he said. ""And I think the majority of players would ask for him to be traded or they would want to be traded...If you have 12 other ballplayers in your locker room that are upset and can't concentrate and always worried about him in the locker room or on the court it's going to be hard for your teammates to win and accept him as a teammate.'' </p><p>He later apologized for the remarks during a telephone interview with FOX affiliate WSVN in Miami. </p><p>""Yes, I regret it. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said I hate gay people or anything like that,"" he said. ""That was my mistake."" </p><p>Writers and NBA personalities, including Heat center Shaquille O'Neal and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, have widely praised Amaechi's revelation. </p><p>But Amaechi himself said he was overwhelmed by the attention he's received and still believes homophobia is rampant in and out of sports. </p><p>''We are much further behind than I'd like,'' Amaechi said, according to the Herald. ""People in America and England would like to think racism is over, sexism is over, and homophobia is over, but it's not. My coming out will show that gay people don't all look like Jack from <i>Will and Grace.</i> Some of us are big, athletic men, and that should be OK.'' </p><p>Amaechi also said he had not heard from a single former teammate or NBA player, but had been contacted by Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers. He also urged heterosexual players to support the cause. </p><p>""It's hard to get straight guys to step up,"" he said. ""When men stood by women during the suffrage movement, they were called progressive and bold. When whites stood by blacks, they were heroes. But a straight guy standing up for a gay guy faces discrimination, and that's a big part of the battle we're fighting."" </p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

HANG THE FUCK UP.<br /><br /><strong>N.Y. lawmaker hopes to ban iPod, handheld use in crosswalks</strong><div class=""abstract""><cite class=""author""><font color=""#1d1d1d"" size=""2"">By Caroline McCarthy, Staff writer, CNET News.com</font></cite></div><div class=""segment""><div class=""detail""><p><span>A New York state senator has announced his plan to introduce legislation that will ban the use of electronic devices such as iPods, BlackBerrys and cell phones while crossing streets in major cities.</span><span><br /><br />State Sen. Carl Krueger, who represents New York's 27th district in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, claimed that the phenomenon of ""iPod oblivion"" has led to a number of fatal accidents on urban streets. While he did not cite any statistical studies that have indicated a rise in such incidents, he referred to the January death of a 23-year-old Brooklyn man who, tuned into his iPod headphones, walked into the path of a city bus.<br /><br />The bill would effectively make it illegal to use any kind of portable electronic device--a music or video player, cell phone, smartphone, gaming device, etc.--while crossing the street in cities such as New York, Albany and Buffalo. Offenders would be slapped with a $100 fine and a criminal court summons. Joggers and bicyclists would have to limit their iPod use to city parks in which no street crossing would be involved.<br /><br />""You can't be fully aware of your surroundings if you're fiddling with a BlackBerry, dialing a phone number, playing Super Mario Brothers on a Game Boy, or listening to music on an iPod,"" Krueger said in a statement. He added that while police in other major cities--such as San Diego, Calif.--have warned that tuning into portable electronic devices may leave pedestrians vulnerable to threats from pickpockets and muggers, he believes that the real threat is from road traffic.<br /><br />The popularity of iPods and BlackBerrys has emerged over only the <a title=""iPod at 5: The little gadget that could -- Friday, Oct 20, 2006"" href=""http://news.com.com/iPod+at+5+The+little+gadget+that+could/2100-1041_3-6127805.html""><font color=""#07519a"">past five years</font></a>, but handheld devices are by no means newcomers to city streets.

And portable radios have been around for even longer.<br /><br /></span><span>Not only will music fans likely complain about an iPod ban, but in New York City, Wall Street's notorious BlackBerry addicts may be loathe to put away their business tools when walking about the streets. But Krueger stands fully behind his new bill. ""Tuning in and tuning out can be a fatal combination on the streets of New York,"" he said.</span></p></div></div></div>"

and in two weeks when ill be able to work 8 hour days ill have NOTHING to do.

i love how that works out. *rolls eyes*

i also sent in&nbsp;an application for some vague weekend job at a petstore in redondo beach. i think it's doing presentations or something with some company. i have noooo freaking clue, but hopefully they'll give me a call and i can get some more answers.&nbsp;

gotta run.
&nbsp;
ps.&nbsp;i apparently&nbsp;woke up SCREAMING at the top of my lungs in the middle of the night and told hunter that he was crushing me and hurting me (maybe he rolled onto my hair because i have a very sensitive scalp...). later in the evening i dreamt that i was being chased by 3 guys who then raped me. it was a really disturbing night in dream land for me it seems..."

(Jan. 17) - Residents in this Panhandle town can call the police for a ride home if they have had too many drinks. The new service was posted in the town's online newsletter Jan. 2, according to the Northwest Florida Daily News. The Shalimar police will take residents who are too drunk to drive home from as far as 25 miles away. <br /><br />""Some other people do the New Year's Eve thing and (the police) were talking, 'Why do it just on New Year's Eve?""' said Tom Burns, the town manager. ""We've got the capability to do it probably year-round."" <br /><br />Residents who get stranded because of mechanical problems also can call for a ride. <br /><br />Burns said the guidelines for the program are still loose and could be changed over time. He said police will have to use commonsense if someone seems to be taking advantage of the service. <br /><br />Police Chief John E. Cash said he's heard other departments offering a similar service, at least during the holiday season. <br /><br />""We're going above and beyond that,"" Cash said. ""I don't think a lot of agencies do it."" </div></div>"

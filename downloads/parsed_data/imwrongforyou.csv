"event","howdy .. well i have been back in good ole' FLA for 4 days now and its not so bad , when i came back last time i just was not doing to good , this time i got it out while i was there. god when megan had to leave me insides just kinda tore , i couldnt stop crying , or then i would stop and start again . one week isnt enough i cant just see her for 7 days and be OK after a year 7 days isnt enough. its so weird for me because im happy here kinda right ? i doubt that sometimes , like sometimes i feel like since i pretend im happy all the time that ive tricked my brain , because when im in brooklyn with everyone its a totally differnt level of happiness , i can laugh geniuenly , i can be comfortable , i have friends again , i can be spontaneous , i can know ill be alright no matter what comes about . im so envious of rachel and megan , they get to be there , they get have oppurtunites ... i dont get why they dont take advantage of eachother , i mean i get it i promise .. i know danny got in the way but dammit who cares , if either one of you really cared about the other it wouldnt matter , im stuck here without either of them and i have a moment everyday where i just would rather die then not be able to see them for months and months at a time , i dont have a choice in the matter but they do and it hurts me that they wont be together ,i remember when we were all happy or as happy as we could be at the time , it would be the four of us or three of us and we could laugh and laugh until it hurt soooooo bad we couldnt stand it to the point where we couldnt breathe , i havent had that in sooo long . if i could i would change things , i would have included rachel in those summers we left her out even though i swear to god it wasnt intentional i would let megan know its not ok to leave her friends for a guy , i wouldnt have been so dramaqueen oriented to make her think she had to stay with me i would have let her go to burger king with joey i wouldnt have pressured her into breaking up with mike , i wouldnt have left her for sam or left rachel for sam for that matter , christ i wish i never met samantha in the first place , before i moved i should have made sure they had a connection to eachother that wouldnt have let this shit happen ... but its not my fault at the same time it is. so much shit has gone on in my life , stuff that a teenager shouldnt have to deal with but all our parents fuck us up right , it doesnt make any of us better , but it makes us all stupid that we dont know better , why doesnt anything ever make sense why cant things just be easy ..."

"event","and im tired
my body aches with feelings i cant place
i laugh at what i saw in you 
i laugh because i still see it
im a basket case that cant be helped
a puzzle you will never put together
you can hurt me easily
and from my random memories , i recall everyone has
my stupid hair and worn out clothes can advert looks from my face
i wont look you in the eye because i know you will see something terrible there
i will risk looking like a jerk to hide my secrets
the things i wish for arent so easy to grant
even if i lead myself to beilve they are
theres irony in my prayers though i wont say what it is
i think thats because i dont know
yes i am a idiot even in my smartest moments
i do care sometimes
not so often anymore
my writting started to be about you but will always be about me
i have demonstrated everything perfectly
i dont know what any of this means
nor do i want to 
i myself will disagree with what you say
maybe its just to be contraditory
and no im not sorry for being a pain in the ass
i do wish i was
i miss certain people
but not certain things
i need some emotions 
but im afraid youve scarred me for life
that was a lie because with each passing day i can hear a phone ring
there are not things i say to be cool
but i know there are things i do
the number of bestfriends i can count on one hand
i know you arent jealous
im always scared i have 
with my better judgement i wont finish that 
i hate the way i know certain things that i dont really know
there are a million and one things i want to tell everyone but no one will ask
i would just say them but i really could not
honestly i know you wouldnt listen
i promise to god i try my best to be what everyone needs me to be
i know i almost always fail
i wonder how i always turn everything into me 
i want to end this now 
but as always i have more to say
should i go on 
i want to but i fear i dont 
how does it come to a point where i cant decide what i want
i do know what i want and i want to tell you 
but no one will ask
dejavou
thats my life 
a series of things just repeating itself
i am waiting for the day where maybe i can be proud
im sorry i dont care about your monolouges
im sorry i dont really listen
i know i am a hypocryte
this list goes on and on
to end this only one thing come to mind
""i cannot be Antigone ""
oh how right he said i was ...."

Sam: I'm not innocent. 
Andrew Largeman: Yes, you are! That's what I like about you, okay? And I don't want this guy taking you to some sketchy quarry in the middle of Newark to find crack whores huffing turpentine or pit bulls raping each other or whatever else is down here! 


Andrew Largeman: You know, this necklace makes me think of this totally random memory of my mother. I was a little kid, and I was crying for whatever reason. And she was cradling me, rocking me back and forth, and I can just remember the silver balls rolling around. And there was snot dripping all over my face. She offered me her sleeve and told me to blow my nose. I can can remember, even as a little kid, thinking to myself, ""This is love... this is love."" 


Andrew Largeman: You remember that idea I had about working stuff out on my own and then finding you once I figured stuff out? 
Sam: The ellipsis? 
Andrew Largeman: Yes, the ellipsis. It's dumb. It's dumb. It's an awful idea. I'm not gonna do it, okay? 'Cause like you said, this is it. This is life. And I'm in love with you, Samantha. I think that's the only thing I've ever been really sure of in my entire life. 

Andrew Largeman: Fuck, this hurts so much. 
Sam: I know it hurts. But it's life, and it's real. And sometimes it fucking hurts, but it's life, and it's pretty much all we got.

woke up
thought of you
everything hurt 
so i did something unmentionable
went back to sleep
i woke up ashamed
"" gotta do some homework "" 
put clothes together
sang about you ( And I can't make it on my own.)
played my guitar
a series of things leading to the word guitar reminded me of you
"" gots to finish my essay "" 
called zach ( Because my heart is in Ohio.)
"" yo pick me up ""
did my hair
walked to the gate 
was offered a ride by a spanish dude
polietly refused ( So cut my wrists and black my eyes )
zach came 
""why do you drive so slow?""
went to mickey d's ( So I can fall asleep tonight, or die.)
""how can you eat so much ?""
found out why 
went to school ( Because you kill me.)
ate my hash brown and drank my orange juice
thought of your love for mickey d's
went running ... for fun ( You know you do, you kill me well.)
i promise i was carful
got through two classes
needed zach for the next three
thought about asking questions in class ( You like it too, and I can tell.)
decided aganist it
""arent you proud ?""
""why should you be proud ?""
got scared again
it passed ( You never stop until my final breath is gone.)
""why do i have a tendancy to lie?""
sat with people i hate
sat through a class i will fail
""why do I always fail?"" ( Spare me just three last words.)
focused on not looking at you
noticed you looking at me
""what do i do?""
""walk away of course"" ( I love you is all he heard.)
thank god for the zachs of the world
he says ""baby you need to be struttin""
i love southern accents
went home 
listen to that song you hate 
and for the first time missed your song bashing
( I'll wait for you, but I can't wait forever.)
( I'll wait for you, but I can't wait forever.)"

A.J.: Joe, I need to ask your advice. Now I know you know a lot about love and women and all that sort of thing... 
Joe: Oh yeah, my wife left me for another woman and my girlfriend forced me to leave at gunpoint. Does this qualify me? 
A.J.: Oh yeah, definitely.

Warren: Why don't you take these CD's and shove them up your ass?

Lucas: Recirculating. 


Warren: STOP CALLING ME WARREN. MY NAME ISN'T FUCKING WARREN. 

Jane: Actually, his new album tested well among teenage males. 
Lucas: Jane, did you compare the percentage of teenage male Rex Manning fans to the incidence of homosexuality amongst teenage males? 

<Joe is talking to the police about Warren] 
Joe: [to Warren] How old are you? 
Warren: Old enough to kick your butt through your skull and splatter your brains on the wall. 
Joe: [to the cops on the phone] Yeah, he's a juvenile. 

Eddie: They're my special recipe... and you know what that means... Lots of sugar. 

Mark: We mustn't dwell... no, not today. We CAN'T. Not on Rex Manning day. 

Jane: What are you doing later? 
Joe: I don't know. I'm either going to jail or hell I can't decide. 

but of course the best scene in this whole movie is when joe plays the drums and lucas and a.j and warren dance and a.j who is oh so hot has his hair and it like does its own dance ..hotness .

I HATE DAVE , now i dont really hate dave i think i just hate the fact that all i hear is dave is so great dave is so wonderful dave is just like me blah blah blah when im not allowed to speak to him ! .. i really dont understand its like why wont you just let me talk to him once . i know its most likly because he doesnt want to talk to me which is understandable because i probably pissed him off when i called him a idiot or a moron or stupid . but im sorry and i promised i wouldnt be mean ever again. maybe its because you want dave all to yourself and your afraid i will steal him and if that is the case get fucked because you know that wouldnt happen. so whatever the reason until i talk to dave HE CAN BURN IN HELLLLLL !!!!!!!!!!! really im serious now . damn you , you have ruined my mellow."

im afraid for myself.
you started that train of thought 
your no longer around to finish it.
when we were speaking 
your voice , it calmed me
now that i dont hear it anymore
im scared ill go insane
im slowly adapting to a life without you
even if its against my will
why would you force me to forget you ?
i need to lay my aching head 
now in someone elses lap
and im scared they will never be like you
all the while i thought we were moving along
you were slowly letting me go
im scared you think im a idiot
why does loving someone make you blind
i always wish upon the stars
its ironic how i never wished for you 
but now im scared i wont ever be able 
to wish for antything else
im scared you are not the person my mind made you out to be
im scared you were pretending this whole time
im scared i can never watch another comedy 
without thinkin of your laugh 
im scared i can never go to bed again 
without first waiting for your call
im scared i can never hug anyone again
without thinking of our 'five minute too long' hugs
im scared you most likely love her more
im scared shes your new bestfriend 
im scared you forgot about me
im scared youve left me all alone
im scared that my bad thoughts 
about you are infact rational
im scared i might hate you
im scared i might be angry with you for hurting me
im scared every single detail of this is my fault
why did you fall into the sky and not take me with you
im sorry for you
scared for me 
damn us because
i love you"

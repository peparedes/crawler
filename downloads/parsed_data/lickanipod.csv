"event","Today was pretty decent aside from the fact that I was really tired(as always). First hour was funny as always, as was second hour. Third hour was hellish. I cannot stand that woman. Fourth hour was funny-ish. Adam Maes told me that I'd be a good mom, and Christian slammed my hand onto the chalkboard, which hurt like hell, but yeah, it was all good I guess. Fifth hour...uh, oh! We did some stupid lab thingie where we measured pipe cleaners maquerading as maggots. I actually am starting to warm up to the people who sit at my table. The one retarded kid went to a different table, and now things are much easier. This one kid Aaron, who always wears a Deftones shirt, is pretty funny, and the kid who sits next to me isn't too bad. Sixth hour is always pretty boring, since it's math and I hate math, but me and Karla talked and stuff, so it wasn't too bad. I have two and a half papers to write by tomorrow, so it should be fun to see how that turns out. I gotta try to go to bed early today. Yesterday I made a ""to do"" list, and I think I'll end up getting like, two things crossed out. Oh well. Tomorrow's another day I suppose."

School Tuesday. That sucks. Oh well, I have no one that I know of in my 3rd, 5th, or 6th hour. But Jewels and Becky are in my first hour. And Sarah, Nikki, Linz, Josh and a million other people are in my second hour, and MINO is in my fourth hour which rocks! I can't wait to see the new espanol teacher, OTTERBACHER?! Doesn't sound very Spanish-y to me. 



Lunch with the OG's! I sense a speech coming. Anyway, if any of you OG's read this, I'm not sure where we're all gonna meet up and all that stuff, and we're either going to Red Robin or Papa Vino's unless someone has a better idea, but fast food places are out cause this is a special lunch, and we gotta do it in style. So let me know. 



Ok, well Laguna Beach is on, and that means it's a marathon, and I have to watch it cause I missed the last episode. God, it just traps me in!! AHH. Alright. See you all Tuesday I guess.

"event","Nikki and I talked today, and post conversation I realized that on Tuesday, the OG's and I are going out to a group lunch, and it will be the last time we're ever together on the first day of school. The last time. It sounds so final, whether I'm saying it in my head or out loud. I mean, I have so many friends that I love to pieces, but somehow, it always comes back to the OG's. They're like, these amazing people who are just always there. They don't even have to physically be near me to have this huge affect on my life. I mean, when I do something stupid, I can imagine Aggie rolling her eyes at me and smirking. And when I do or say something funny, I can see Nikki crackin up right along with me. Everytime I drive by St. Rene's I think of Laura and Mare, and us making fun of Krystyna for being in angel choir. And God, practically every time I think of dancing or school or something completely random like drawing black circles on cd's so you can burn them, I think of Julie, ever so charming, even when she's being completely retarded. I guess I just realized how different things will be once we graduate. I'm going to miss them so much, they all mean the absolute world to me. There are times when I love them more than my own family, and that is something that will always connect me to them. Wherever life ends up taking us, even if we aren't friends, we'll still be friends, as weird as that sounds. They are part of me. Past, present, and future. And today I realized just how impossibly amazing they are and they just keep getting better. So yeah, I love all my friends: Mina, Kasia, Sue, Pri, Sarah, Kim, Lindsey everybody a whole lot. But the OG's will always have this place in my life, and my heart, that will never change. So to end this completely....nostalgic and probably boring entry, I just want to say one thing. You guys mean the world to me, and I love you so much. Ok I'm done rambling now. :)"

And I miss Jcraw a lot. Lucky bitch, gets to go to Hawaii. I got her postcard today. I'm in a really Girl-powery mood. I miss my Darah Semos and Kimby and Kasia, and of course, Lindsey and Mino. Sigh. I planned to hang out so much more this summer, but somehow it just ended up being me and Nikki and Pri most of the time. I can't believe the summer is almost over. I still haven't gotten my senior pics taken, and hopefully, since we know the lady doing them, I can have them done in time for the cutoff or whatever. Hmmm. I have to babysit tomorrow, Wednesday and Friday, which sucks, but at least I get paid. I got a really cute new purse and wallet last week(I think) when me, Nikki, Aggie, and Mare went to the mall. It's sooooo awesomeness!! Anyway, I think I'm gonna go some tv.

I mean, I like a little drama in my life, but not that much. Yeah, things happen in my life and all, but my god, I never want to live a life of all that dramatic, angsty depression. DIOS MIO! That was my epiphany of the day.


So anyway, Aya is leaving tomorrow. Which sucks. I'm really going to miss her and all her weird, annoying, funny, retarded antics. Things will never really be the same, but I guess that's the way it goes.


Holy crap, it's 3:30 in the morning, and I cannot fall asleep, which is why I'm updating in the first place. When school starts I'm gonna be so screwed. I go to bed at like, four every morning, and wake up around eleven. Usually I just sit in my room and read or watch movies on my laptop, but tonight, since my parents aren't home, I'm down on the computer watching VH1 and downloading music. Good times cause I love putting music on that IPOD of mine, which I chipped the screen of, by the way. Ok, well, I think I'm done now. Goodnight all."

Uh, let's see, well, me and Nikki and Wenis were late getting there cause they had to pick me up and then we had to get balloons. We didn't get a pavillion because of some jack ass family reunion. Anyway, bunches of people started coming after we got there. A bunch of Butcher people were there, and they turned out to be really nice, which was surprising. Um, when Aya got there we all started throwing water balloons and such, and Chris got me completely soaked. He's such a retard. I tried getting him, but the balloons never broke. Stupid balloons! Anyway, Nikki and Andrea pulled out the silly string and got each other, and a few other people, including me. Hmm, people played volleyball and Andrea and I made fun of Nikki when she played. Pri wasn't much better than her. Some people from Nike set up this inflatable batting cage thingy, and a bunch of Butcher boys went and checked it out. There was a cute-ish boy there. Woot! Aya opened her presents and stuff. Then people went and played football for a little while. Then we pretty much all started leaving/cleaning up because the party was moving to Kim's house. Nikki, me, Andrea, and Aya drove to my house and dropped me off, then they dropped Aya off at Kim's. Now I'm just sitting around, relaxing. I went to bed at around 3 yesterday so I was really tired. I took a little nap, and I feel much better. So in conclusion, I had a really good time today, and I'm glad that we threw Aya this party.

Anyway, it was fun because I got to see like, my entire family, which usually only happens at Christmas and New Years. It was grand. There were two really cute waiters! And the food was <b>amazing</b>! Then Saturday we my dad's uncle's summer get together. Me and Liv hung out and stuff. I got to see Cody who is soooo cute! Um, I totally kicked Liv's ass at rummy and crazy 8's. Good times. I really like my dad's side of the family, but we don't get to see them often, so I'm glad we went because usually only my dad goes. Hmm. Yesterday was my cousin Nick's birthday, so we went over to my aunt and uncle's house. The party was ok. I went swimming for a loooong time and I played with my little cousin Katie. Took some real cute pics of my Pookie and of my cousin AJ. I love my family. They're so...I don't even know. Just great. Today we're going to my aunt's birthday party, so that should be fun because I'll get to see my pookadee again! Woo! This week I'm gonna hang out with that Nikki girl sometime.

Moving on, yesterday was really fun. Swiddie's exam totally kicked my ass with all the grammar and stuff. Then I went to Mr. French's class and I'm just like ""Ugh, we have to take a slide test, a scantron test, and do a paragraph about modernism..."" Well, to my immense joy and surprise, he only made me and Lindsey do the slide test, which I'm pretty sure I got an A+ on, which is awesome. After we watched <i> Citizen Kane</i> which is an ok movie. Kinda sad, but still pretty swell. I blasted music from my car on the way home. It was awesome because I have a car adapter for my IPOD and now I can listen to music I actually like. Go Jenn. Then I got home and that girl Nikki called me, and her and Josh came and picked me up and we went to Burger King (I want that General Grievous Nikki!) and then we saw <i>Batman Begins</i> which I loved, mostly because Christian Bale is REALLY SEXY! AHH, ORGASM! Anyway, then they dropped me off and I took a nap. Then I pretty much just sat around, and that was fine with me because I think I'm getting a cold. Sigh...Oh well.

Tonight I'm going to dinner at Red Robin with Nikki, Laura, and Agata. Then we're going to see <i> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</i>, which should be fun.

<lj-cut text=""Ode To Julie"">
Julie's a girl who likes em' young
Especially when they give tongue

Right now she dates a boy named Paul
They aren't the same age at all!

A PT Cruiser is what she drives
Math makes her break out in hives

Julie has a million pets
STD's are what she gets

Julie no habla ingles (ing-lace)
I'd like to punch her in the face

<lj-cut text=""Ode To Mare (Not Done Yet)"">
Mary Ann is nice and shy
Once I poked her in the eye

When she laughs, Julie cracks up
Mare drinks tomato sauce in a cup

Her favorite food is corn on the cob
I hear she gives a great hand job!
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Ode To Kim"">
Kim dated a skillitin
But dumped him cause he was WAY too thin

She has two different colored hair
And doesn't believe in underwear

She wants to move to Beasley-land
And join his father's incestuous band

She always turns her stuff in late
She's too high to know the date

At night she rests her two-toned head
And dreams of Nikki in a sled
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Ode To Susan"">
Susan Lee was very whore-y
Until she met a guy named Kory

She is Mrs. Cardenes's bitch
In her eye she has a twitch

When she comes home from work she smells like food
And has a major attitude

People cry after she's sung
She sounds worse than William Hung

She hates when people step on her toes
She is friends with all the hoes!
</lj-cut>

"event","<lj-cut text=""Ode To Nikki""> 
Nikki says that we can't play
I rather think that she is gay

Her shirt was made for little boys
She doesn't own erotic toys

Look, oh look, at her webbed feet
That must suck when there is sleet

Her bacne glows in the sun
She has enough for everyone
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Ode To Sarah"">
Sarah Demos dated Kozzie
She might as well have dated Ozzie

People say she has black people lips
She likes sex with chains and whips

Her boyfriend is good jailbait
He is prone to pre-ejaculate

""Toxic"" is a song she sings
Lots of diseases is what she brings
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Ode To Blerta"">
Blerta is a fashion freak
A rich, old man is what she seeks

She used to fantasize about Mark Gjolaj (Joe-lie)
Until she found out he breeds e coli

Next she liked the Zipperman
Until she found out he lives at Art Van

Then there was old Mr. French
She hit him in the eye with a park bench  

Her nickname has become ""Shrubs""
She table dances, drunk, at clubs
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Ode To Lindsey"">
Lindsey works at Limited Too
But she belongs in the zoo

All she does is dance, dance, dance
And sometimes she forgets her pants

She has a Michael Jackson purse
Someday she'll be in a hearse

Poking at dead people is her choice profession
Necrophilia is her obsession

Many people think her strange
Because her clothes she doesn't change
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Ode To Agata"">
Agata thinks she has a big head
When she laughs, her face turns red

She used to want to do Nick Grenon
Until she discovered she likes John Lennon

She likes to do good in math
Its been...a while since she's had a bath

Polish is her way of living
Lots of head she's always giving

She had sex in a car with B-cad
And a threesome with his dad
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Ode To Jenn (I'm conceited)"">
Jenn is rude and mostly mean
She doesn't care for Charlie Sheen

She wore a hoodie every day
She thinks that her best friend is gay

She's always over Nikki's house
Mostly she eats and sits on the couch

One time she tried to eat her brother
And she got a stomachache like no other
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Ode To Mina"">
Mina had a unibrow
She, thankfully, doesn't have one now

She loves all of Zautcke's tales
And she eats ice chips when it hails

Ms. Feger's shoes are all she needs
Her diapered cat she rarely feeds

She hates people who line up and the door
Her and Zautcke have sex on the classroom floor
</lj-cut>



You see, this is what happens when you have too much time on your hands and a weird imagination. 


Hmm...today was good. Me and that Lindsey girl had pizza in Mr. French's class. It was yummy. Only 7 days left of school!! WOOT!"

"event","So right now I am in the middle of a huge bout of <b>wanderlust</b> and I can't seem to snap out of it. That's why I am going to inquire about staying out west for the majority of the summer. When I close my eyes these days all I can see is sipping Pina Coladas in my step aunt's sprawling stucco ranch, swimming in the Nevada-shaped pool, spending the entire summer lounging about, and finally getting away from the stress that my year has been comprised of. This year I realized that I'm not going to be able to get into a good college, so Macomb is really my only option. I didn't get into AP English, which further killed my dreams. I can only hope that I'm a ""late bloomer"" and that my time to be successful will come soon. 

I need a break. School has never been so...exhausting. This whole year has been one big emotional and physical rollercoaster. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning I would rather die than drag myself out of bed. I think that all the stress and anxiety is going to boil over one day and I'm just going to crack. Chances are, it won't be pretty when I do.

In conclusion, I want to go away this summer. I need a mental health...summer. I have to save what little sanity I have left."

"event","I <b> REALLY</b> want to go on a road trip this summer. I'm already flying to Vegas in July, but I really wanna go on a road trip. That would be so fun. I just don't want to go as far as Vegas, I'm talking like Cedar Point(most likely) or like, Chicago or something. I keep seeing the Coke commercial where those 4 boys are on a trip and I'm so jealous!! I WANNA GO!! Ok, I'm done."

"event","So I'm staying home alone again tonight. It's ok during the day, but at night I get so paranoid. It's so...creepy to be all alone. The dark kind of sneaks up on you and you start thinking that you're seeing things that aren't really there and its all so...unnerving. Its weird, to say the least."

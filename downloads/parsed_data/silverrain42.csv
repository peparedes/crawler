"event","Whee...  First post in a week.  Tried to post this earlier, but screwed up my password, and I really *didn't* feel like retyping the whole entry right then.

So anyway, I got my order from Amazon.com much earlier than I expected.  With the free shipping special they were offering, they said I wouldn't get it till next week.  Turns out it got here *a lot* sooner than expected.  It came in on Thursday.

I picked up the Fall of Castle Bondi (expansion for Castle of Magic) and Fire Zone (expansion for Frag).  Now, for the promised review of the Fall of Castle Bondi.

Honestly, I'm a bit disappointed.  To cut back on printing costs, they printed the expansion as a perfect bound book.  Now, giving that this is an expansion for a *board game*, that seems a little silly, doesn't it?

Well, they did it to pass on all the costs of printing/photocopying onto the people who buy the book.  However, the book does contain an excellent selection of new scenarios/options for playing Castle of Magic.  These include options for 1, 2 and 3 player games, as well as several new scenarios.  They range from the good to the tacky.

The tacky is 'Cattle of Magic'.  The Monster has been replaced by 'Farmer John' and all of Farmer John's cows are trying for control of the 'Bondi Barn'.  Anyway, I'm now feeling inspired.  I was looking for an idea for a Java programming project for my Career Seminar class.  Coding up Castle of Magic with all the expansions is sounding like an excellent idea.

Anyway, that's all for right now from Staatsburg.  Good night all."

"event","Weehee....  It's my first ever LiveJournal post.  And what an exciting weekend I've had.  Aside from generally being lazy, what did I do...  Let's see...

Well, I finally finished up the Chrysler building in Parasite Eve.  Finished up Floors 61-70 on Saturday night, and then beat Maya/Eve this morning.  2nd ending was a bit of a disappointment, but it's done.

Last week, I knocked off both the 1st and 2nd endings of Kingdom Hearts.  Definitely a worthwhile game to pickup.  Not as long as Final Fantasy X, but worth playing, all the same.

And finally, turns out there is a *2nd* expansion for Castle of Magic.  It also includes a reprint of the Castle Cursed expansion (the 1st expansion), as well as a brand new expansion.  I'll post a review once it arrives.

That's all for now from Staatsburg."

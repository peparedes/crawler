"event","so ive been treating my body a lot better. quit the drinking and smoking. i had to as i took a vow to wicca that i will respect my body, for its my temple. better for me anyways. im trying to loose weight and beer is the worst thing as for each bottle contains twice the carbs as 1 slice of bread. ive also been walking at night so i feel better about myself. i feel like my legs are getting toned.as for my dad cayman,he's still trying to hang in there.even though hes grumpy a lot of the time because hes sick, i feel like my father resents me. ever since ive come back from cali 3 years ago he's treated me like shit. i didnt do anything wrong, i was 20 and just wanted to see if i could make it on my own, instead it just turned out to be a disaster. my brothers done worse stuff than i have and he hasnt treated him like shit in the past 5 years, since he got his act together. i feel like i should be moving outta there cuz he doesnt want me around. so, hopefully i will find a job and get my own place, even if i have to struggle for a bit. what the hell do i have to do to set things right? im tired of hearing his arrogance. 
May the Gods and Goddess watch over all of you.
Blessed Be

"event","Your body is your temple:care for it! do not engage in uselss activity.Listen to the Goddess. Help thyself. You create your own reality. The Warrior's path is creativity. A serene path to enlightenment.Know thyself.Master thyself. Create your own reality. Nurture the ability to perceive the truth in all matters. Grace and guilt do not exist. Strive for responsibility. Honor thyself.Create your own reality. Never disgrace the Goddess, the God, nor Wicca. Do not harbor sinister designs, Harm none, do what thou wilt. Master thyself, create your own reality. The warrior is noble with the conviction that heroes are made of...the warrior would fight not to win, but to be free, for that is the grand prize. Everything else will follow. The Wiccan Warrior is human, though not perfect. He/She tries to treat each person with kindness and respect. The warrior rolls with the punches and attacks and even says to you, ""Be Blessed my brother or sister."" the Wiccan Warrior can take a whooping and use it as a lesson and knows not to become hard and bitter in attitude through meditation....The Wiccan Warrior will fight with no stain. the warrior is passionate and a deep thinker who is true to the God and Goddess and everything that is scared. The wiccan warrior can smile because the warrior is a witch and appreciates everything and takes nothing for granted. a wiccan warrior is a person who cares, and is compassionate....and an observer of all things great and small. he is provider, lover, sensual, strong, fragile,determined, and open minded. A great wiccan warrior is all these things and more to be a wiccan fighting for justice,compassion,understanding,and no fear. So, I got this book today called the Full Contact Magic-A book of shadows for the Wiccan Warrior, written by Kerr Cuhulain.For a long time i have gone back and fourth with wanting to be Wiccan. I was unsure of it and started looking into other religions to find a peacefullness in my life. I have been drawn to Wicca for a long time to come. I believe that is my path. So far this book has been great and I feel a lot of power come from it when I am reading it. I dont believe at the time I was ready to become part of the Wiccan Occult, but I believe it is my time now. I have been ready to turn my life around for the longest time, and I wasnt quite sure how. I belive this book provides some truth and understaning of how to live a fulfulling life through Wicca. Robin, this book is so good that when I am done I will lend it to you because you have had an intrest in Wicca. It explains a lot more than that other book you read at my house. Be Blessed everyone. Have safe and happy travels.

"event","hi world,
so everything has been going the way I want it to. Victor made me feel really good this weekend. I was chillin with him and Marcy and Alvero on Friday and Saturday evening. Michael was there and Victor wanted to go get his cash and this gameboy that he says he bought for me from michael(he knows i love super mario, so he got me that just so i could have it.how sweet, but I wont get it till he gets another $10.00, but its nice that he's doing that!!) so he asked me if it was okay for him to go with michael to go get it. it was about 11:30pm and it would take him about half an hour. HE ended up drinking but he wasnt drunk and john and they wanted to go to the eastside to go get a sack but he told them he wasnt going to go because he'd rather be chillin with me and i was waiting for him at marcy's so he came back for me. marcy didnt want me walking back to his house by myself that late at night so she made me stay, even though its practicly 1 block away. so when he rang the door bell he was so cute. he said; I came back for the Joykins because she's the best and I adore her. He was so sweet. then he took me in his arms and wouldnt let me go. that made me feel so good. then on sunday we went back to marcys and she said that was the cutest thing she had seen because she has never seen that side of him before. marcy thinks he is falling in love but he wont admit it because hes afraid of being hurt. I will never hurt him. I know I have done things in the past but since the summer i know that he's the one for me. My classes have been good. I recieved another A in my technical report writing class. thats all ive been getting are A's. In Drama I got a B on my midterm. I guess it's true what they say; you are successful if you are good and intrested in a certain subject that you enjoy. Now that I got all the boring classes out of the way, everything has been good. I also decided that I am going to apply myself more. I guess I havent been caring so much, but I do now. In Drama today we were talking about Henrik Ibson's play A Doll's House and its relationship to society and how women can be successful and change their marriage around to make it work. He said everyone can brake past family cycles and be a success if we want to. I want to be successful. I want to graduate with honor's and go to a good school after I get my B.A.S. I know I can do it because this semster has proven it. I got those A's in class that I said I would get. In Drama I need to work at it a little more even though I have a B. A B is not acceptable for me. I know people say that that's a good grade and it is, but I am not satisfied with it. Anywho, gots to go.

"event","so tarin is going back to school. its about time.she went to this 3 hour class and they told her she has till the 18th of nov to find a job because if she didnt theyd take her off of welfare. they want her to be doing something. this welfare place is going to help her find a job. they are also going to get her into the community college in san marcos, ca where she lives. she took a placement exam for math and she still has to take one for english and reading to see where shes at. its about time. she said she wants to make a better life for my goddaughter, emily. she will be getting an associates degree in education because she wants to continue. im happy for her because its hard to believe she hasnt done drugs in almost 2 years and doesnt want anything to do with them. shes finally using her brain. her mom prayed and prayed for this. i really hope she will fall through. shes gotten stronger than she has. its sad the way it happend though. she had to have a kid to get her ass straight. i guess she has a better future for herself after all. so speaking of school, i got a B on my midterm for my Drama class. I didnt think id do that well. so i have a B so far in both of my classes. I am going to try and get my grade up to an A for drama. I cant do that for my other class because of the way he grades. oh well. thats still good. my mom wants me to go to utep next semseter but i am afraid i wont get financial aid for it. also my transcript doesnt look very good right now which is why i want to get my gpa up next semester before i go there. i cant believe i am almost done.it has been a long 3 years at epcc. if it werent for those remedial classes i would have already been out of here. oh well. oh, i talked to this girl Ashley Provencio that I went to school with and was on the dance team with. I havent talked to her in almost 3 1/2 years. I think about the team every so often and wonder what the girls are up to. I know some of them like Shannon Stull, Lauren Francis, and Betsy Echlin went away to college so they arent here. but anyways, me and Ashley decided that we want to send out invitations for a little reunion to see what everyone is up to.Belive it or not they were like sisters to me so it would be cool to get in touch with everyone and reminise on the good times. besides they were good people and id rather have them in my life than all the loosers ive been chillin with.

"event","I give up dammit! I am so tired of trying to please everyone and not getting any thankyous in return. I just don't care anymore. Everyone just gets greedy and expects more than I can give. So I am spoiling myself for a change. Victor is right, I need to change my ways and start being stubborn and stuff in that sense, so I am just going to do that. Everything I do is not good enough so fuck it, I am going to start doing stuff for myself. I really dont care that much anymore on what anyone has to say. The only ones who seem to be happy with what I do is Robin and Victor. Everyone else expects more from me and I can only do so much. Besides, I feel like my time in El Paso is almost up. Mom is right, I think it is time for a change in my life. I'll finish my Bachalor's degree at UTEP and then move on to another university. Not sure where I want to go. I am thinking about checking out the midwest like Chicago or something. So far, I have my doubts still about me and Victor. I made a decision and told him if we were still together and my parents decided to move to Phoenix to be near my brother, that I would stay here with him and finish school here. He said I should only do what is right for me and take oppertunities that come along. So with that said I dont know where this is going to go. If I have to and only if I have to I will go where the money is. I would like to stay here with him because I love him.He doesnt know how much. I wish he wasnt blind and could see that something good could come out of this. After saying that I wanted to stay here with him and finish school because I do like El Paso and I think its a good place to raise a family, he thinks that I want to stay here because I am hoping for marriage out of this. I, however am not ready to take that step. I need to concentrate on my education. Give me another 4 years and then we'll talk marriage. Until I am finiancially stable and can offer something, marriage is out of the question. I do have faith in myself that my future will work out the way I want it too. I give up on trying to make everyone satisfied and decide to make myself happy. I will do things for myself because if I do them for other people things wont go the way I want to and I will give up on it. Oh by the way, I thought this was a funny story. Victor was drunk on tuesday night and had ended up going to chris's house and didnt know how he was going to get there so he decided he wanted to take off but michael didnt want him to go so they started fighting and he had taken his shirt off then chris told michael to let him go because he says when he wants to leave he leaves. He was hungry and next to Sams so he dicided he'd go get some food but ended up stealing a pie that looked good. he didnt have his shirt on and no one was in the store and didnt see him leave with it and once he got out he started running and was over by the tracks and ended up tripping and smashing the pie. eventhough it was smashed he still ate it. ha ha. i thought that was funny. I would have been laughing my ass off. Have a nice day!!

"event","Great news everyone!!!!My parents went to San Antonio yesterday and it turns out that there is a liver available for him. I was in the room while Mom was talkig to my brother and she said Dad got the luck of the draw. I think they will be going to San Antonio before the holidays. He will get it before the end of the year. Apperantly she has to go with him. They will be there for 3 months. I will have the house to myself for that period of time. What I am worried about is my parents will be in a bad financial situation. The transplant will be about $350,000.00 and the medicine my Dad will be on is going to cost thousands of $. My aunt says if my mom needs the help that she will come down here and be with her but instead of that I think she could pitch in money for the bill. She's rich and she aint doing anything but traveling. It would be great if she could sell her house and get a cheap house here but she's too damn stubborn for that. I really need you guys to start praying that the surgery will be successful. Without his liver he wont live. Please Pray for him. I talked to my brother yesterday and he found a job working in a wearhouse. He makes $10.50 an hour. Thats more than Ford would pay him.Mom wants me to go to Phoenix with her to see him in the first week of November, just for the weekend. We would leave on Friday after I get out of class and come back on Sunday evening. With the cost of this transplant I think my mom and dad will end up selling the house and getting a small 1 bedroom condo. With this in mind I better get on top of things.I dont want to leave el paso because things with my man are going really well. I might take a semeseter off school in the spring and get into the episd as a teacher's aid. I need to get my own place and a job just to back myself up. I might end up moving into the Warren Inn. I would like to move into vic's moms house because Liz is taking a job offer she got in Pesco, Washington in their school district. That means there will be a free room, but I think Grandma Vilchis will be taking over the room. She deserves it, she sleeps in the living room. Besides, I want to show My Baby that I can make it on my own and hopefully that will show him that I am responsible and maybe he would get the idea that in the future I can be dependable if we move in together. So anyways, I need to go because I have my first test in Drama today.
Always,

im sitting here at school bored with nothing to do. i have a lot of work for my class next week.i gotta go to the career center and look at the occupational handbook and write a memo summarizing it to my teaher. then i have to write a letter to a teacher asking permission to use them as a reference and request a letter of reccomendation. then i have to write a descption of a previous job or a job i am intrested in. he doesnt want us working on it yet so i gotta wait. This class is kind of hard because hes so fucking picky. i hope i did this last assignment correctly.RObin you thought Padillia was bad try this guy out. HA HA. I have midterms for Drama next tuesday. Its open book, longhand written essay but we dont know the questions. Im glad I could help you Robin. Usually Im not good with advice stuff. But Im getting better at expressing my opinions. Today is friday. I have no plans.so it looks like i will be at home today. thats okay. i dont really party anymore anyways. I do get bored though. Oh get this, even though angle and tweedy arent together anymore she still calls the fucking house. she had the nerve to call and say that she was in the hospital.just so we could know. i dont know why she is still calling. i cant stand it. then she calls my brother's friend in phoenix to try and get to him. He doesnt want to talk to her. She needs to stop and get over it. I hope this doesnt become a harrasment problem. Shes so annoying,then i saw that she called 3 times yesterday. I cringe when I see her name on caller ID. Ive been a bit happier cuz shes not around anymore than I am happy cuz i dont talk to Marissa or my ex-fiance joey anymore. I dont know what i was thinking hanging out with them. Loosers!!!! well laters

"event","Robin--- I know you are a strong person. I am glad that you are over the angry part. I know there is someone out there for you so never give up. When the time comes there will be someone that will love you with all their heart and do everything possible to keep you happy. Never settle for less or loosers that dont have anything together. I know that deep down Josh is a good guy but more than likely, he doesnt know what he wants and he doesnt seem very happy with himself. He has told me in the past that he was looking for that certian person but honestly he needs to make himself happy and get his life together and figure out what he wants to do. I think he may know what he wants to do, but he doesnt know how to grab the things he wants. He needs to be motivated and have more confidence and be able to trust people and work on his communication. Until he does and has those things, I dont think he will be able to make his significant other happy. Be patient Robin, make yourself happy and try and figure out a plan for yourself, which you have partially done,and then love will come along the way. You already have a lot of confidence in yourself and like you said, that is a big attraction in a person. I myself am trying to work on that. I'm trying to have more pride in my appereance and the way I carry myself and I think I am becooming a happier person. I am trying to figure out how to get everything that I want but I know it is so hard to do so because people are greedy when I try to help them and they almost take everything away from me, but I made a promise to myself, that I wouldnt let it stand in my way anymore. Victor was right, I shouldnt care what other people say to me that dont matter to me. I always took things to the heart but Im not anymore. I think thats what got in my way. I am going to make myself happy and those that I care about. Screw what others say. I know who my real friends are and that they care and so does my family. I may feel like everything is so messed up but I know that everything will fall into place. It always does. I just also want to thank you for always being there for me girl. I hope I am doing the same for you. I feel like you are one of my friends for life and I will never let you down. We may have had small fights but I know that we are friends till the end.

Robin spent the night on friday cuz i felt weird without my dog there. on saturday we went to go see the Exorcisim of Emily Rose. THat was pretty good. I spent the night at her house to get away from my family. My aunt got on my case and acts like she can control me and tell me what to do with my life and she has no business doing that because up until my uncle died all she did was send us money every year around birthdays and the holidays.She went travelling all the time and she wouldnt come to el paso because she doesnt like it. she really had no visitations since i was a teenager and now all of a sudden she would start comming to visit cuz shes lonely? thats bullshit. she has no business getting on my case cuz she wasnt active in my life until now. so i cant stand it anymore there. on top of this victor was supposed to go to albuquerque to go work and his boss cancled it and he never called to say he wasnt going becuase he wanted a small break. thats bullshit too. im going to start being the same way towards him. also im hoping my brother will stay in phoenix because once i finish at community college, if things arent turning out the way i want them to, im going to go check it out. besides, my mom thinks i need a change anyways. it would be a good time for me to start over. well, laters all.

"event","well heres the response for you Robin- For the first time I was actually able to have a convo with my mom without arguing. You are right my mom is very depressed over my dad and my brother. She feels like she is loosing her strength. I think im the one to blame for messing things up. I told her though she has a shoulder to cry on. My aunt is very worried about her. Im trying my best to listen and not to argue with her. I think most of it was because I have a loud voice a lot of the time when I speak, so Ive tried to get in the habbit of talking softly and its starting to work. My dad takes things out a lot because he is probably bored in the house all of the time and cant do much because he cant stand up for a long period of time. He doesnt eat much any more. He is wasting away. He has lost more weight and is down to 200p. He used to be at 245p. He looks long and thin.I know when they told him he had to stop working he was so angry. He didnt want to be stuck home all the time and it was going to be harder on us financially. About my brother, she is afraid that he wont be making it or struggling at a dead end job. Both of us, however, are happy that that broad isnt in the picture anymore. Our prayers were answered fast. But she isnt happy about the fact he gave up casa ford. We are both praying that Robert will find something in Phoenix, since he did leave today.Shes worried if he doesnt find a job that he will loose his car or that she will have to help him with it. We blame the stupid bitch for fucking everything up. We believe if he hadnt of gotten involved with her things would still be the same. My brother looked pretty sad today and yesterday, but he feels theres nothing here for him. I hope he will find something and be happier in Phoenix. If he stays and has a place and stuff, we will be seeing him in the beginning of November. She thinks if he stays there that i should go up there. she thinks i need a change after school. If something happens to my dad, she will be selling the house because we wont be able to pay for it, then I will probably be going with her. I think I do need a change. If me and VIc are still together when that time comes for the desision, I will ask him where he wants to be with this relationship, and as a matter of fact within the next 2 years I have a feeling that I will be making these decisions, and if I have to,before we leave, I will ask him to marry me or at least get an apartment with me. If he turns it down, then I will be on my way and try to make it a long distance thing because I will be back to visit friends and such every now and then. If he doesnt want that long distance thing and an apartment, hopefully Liz would be out so maybe I could move in.But if it doesnt go that way, then I will be on my way to Phoenix. Tarin said she would ask him to come with me if she were me.But you know him, hes stubborn. In that time though it should be going somewhere. I want to be close as possible to my mom and brother though if something happens with dad. Afer My dog Beebo died today it made me realize that time is precisious and I am greatful for all the nice people I have in my life and my family seems to be disappering and I dont know when the people are close to me, are not going to be here anymore. I almost feel as if my time in El Paso is comming to an end and another chapter of my life is about to begin. But I also feel that this chapter now, is going to have a sad ending and a new beginning for bigger and better things to come. I dont know what my destiny holds, but I know I am just chillin for now and having a good time.

The topic is the plays relationship to immigration. I didnt get the one I wanted Angels in America by Tony Kushner on Dec. 1. Oh well the other one was second choice. i got lucky because i missed class on tuesday which is why i didnt get it. I still have a little time to put everything together. i dont care as long as i get it done and have an A in the class at the end of the semester. our mid-term is on October 4th over Odepius Rex and Media(Ha HA Robin, once againg I have to read that Damn play!!!).He did say we would end up going over that one in every english class.BLEH BLEH BLEH!!!!!WEll victor took off to Alburquerque till saturday. hes bring me back a big chunk of change. maybe he pay my bills? yeah right. he is though taking me to dinner and a movie. he can take me out now. he just didnt before cuz he was broke.im glad he went cuz now i have a break from him. ha ha. i think i really did need a break. He keeps saying im too attached and that he wants a break and then he wants me over all the time. well i'll give him his break cuz i need one too and watch he'I ll change his mind again. why is it robin that guys have to be a pain and cant make up their mind? and then they say we cant make up our mind> isn't josh the same way? i shouldnt have introduced them, maybe it rubbbed of on victor, lol?ha ha!!!! Yea!!! Sex and the City is back on. I think that is a great show. I was watching it on tuesday night. I couldnt get into it at first but now I love it. I think it is my new favorite show. The O.C. is my absoulute fav but Sex and the City comes next.The show pretty much explained how I kind of feel right now. It was talking about how us women are independent and how we become the enimeies of married coupples that we used to be friends with then stop being friends with them because their wives get jealous. Then it they talk about how important it is to have our girls night out and how we are happier when we are independent. Sometimes I wonder if I am going to be the single one or the marrying type. I would like to get married one day but at the same time I dont think I am the marrying type. I am used to being independent and I'm now just realizing if it doesnt work out with my boo everything will still be okay. All that matters is that i have my friends and family and that i finish my education and become successfull. If things do end between me and Victor I hope me and him will still be friends.We've been through so much already and I wouldnt want to mess up what we've got. He's someone I can really count on and someone to be there for me when I need a shoulder to cry on. Sometimes I feel like he is one of my best friends. But in truth I think my mom is my best friend. I think she just gets on my case because she wants the best for me. I sometimes wish we could have a better realationship. I regreat all the pain Ive gave my parents. But at times they treat me like shit for no reason. I guess I will try and make peace with them. I think my mom is under a tremendous amount of stress. Ive always been the type that doesnt have good communication skills and I really should work on that with her. When things dont go my way and I dont talk very much about them I tend to take things out on her. I think she is really depressed over my dad and my aunt says so too. Aunt Terry says I should try and talk with her if she needs to talk about whatever is bothering her. I think she is also depressed becuase me and my brother didnt turn out to be the kids she wanted us to be. She says that your parents are lucky Robin that everyone was successful in your family. I dont know how to make her proud and how to show her she is very well much appreciated. I know one day I will show her when I figure out how. But now I dont think anything can compare to what she has done for me. I cant wait to see where this path takes my future. Im pretty impatient about it. Im seeking a lot of things and I will get everything that I have want in my life even if its going to be a hard road travel."

well, i have officially got sick of living at home. Im tired of the bs. I dont know what the deal is with my mom. once again she is covering up for my brothers stupidity. she tries to say he has a job but my dad says he doesnt. my parents have been giving me shit ever since Brandia opened her big mouth. robert has started in too. tarins mom wont let her come down here because i dont have a place and she doesnt want her getting screwed. so today im going a job hunting. im tired of being broke and also have nothing to do. so maybe once i find a job i can get a place and tarin can come here. i really miss her. i havent seen her in almost 3 years. i really want to move out too,and i think shes the only one i can trust as a roommate for rent and shit. im almost 24, i should be on my own anyways. i now remember why i left home in the first place. i sometimes wish i havent come back to live at home. at least i am not sick anymore. i just manily feel like i have allergies. i dont think im having a kid eathier. i think it was just the flu. anywho.laters all. i dont have much to say.

"event","I can't believe it. My brother is being really stupid lately. I think Brandia's stupidness has had an impact on him. They officially set the date for their wedding, November 5. I dont know whats wrong with my brother. He is so much smarter. 1st of all he doesnt know that she is taking pregnancy pills so she can get pregnante. A long time ago she had an abortion so im kind of hoping they dont have a kid right now. Also he is out of a job because he was going to accept a job for Crawford and then he turned it down. Shes a manager at Taco Hell ( i don't know how that happend) so they wouldnt be able to afford it. I have a really bad feeling that she is going to fuck up his life. She's also a manipualter and a lier.Ive known her for years so i know this is a fact. This is an example of how dumb she is. She thought the government payed for the house my parents had and the government is paying for my education. i dont think the government would be paying for a really nice house on the west side in a neighborhood where theres a lot of houses that a doctor or lawyer would own. i dont think the government would also pay for a mercedes. i cant even qualify for financial aid. then she said she doesnt smoke around kids and she brought this beautiful boy over and she was smoking outside because he wanted to go out there and play. No one in my family likes her and cant stand her. My dad doesnt even want her comming over. Also everyone that knows her doesnt like her. Shes also got a big mouth. i confided in her just to test her and she cant seem to keep her mouth shut. so for that being, im going to try and avoid her as much as possible. WHat the hell does Tweedy see in her? I can tell you this i dont think i am going to go to the wedding. I love Tweedy and shit but I dont want to see him runing his life. Everytime i see her i just want to punch the lights out of her. 
SO what else is going on in my pathetic world? Tarin is talking about comming down here this week. John tried to kill her on friday. he slammed her against the car while she had emily in her hands. He tried to choke her and forced her in the car and took her to Hemet for 2 days. took the phones away from her so she couldnt call anyone. then he gave emily to the mom and she had to leave the room so he could hit her. he threw her on the floor and started pulling on her hair and almost pulled it out. then he slapped her around. Tecnically she has $700 saved and her mom could get her welfare from her debt card and send it down here everymonth. Im tired of hearing about her problems but she cant do anything about it. so i told her she would have a place to stay and she could prob have a job by next week. i told her i wasnt working and she said she doesnt care as long as i help out with emily. so since everyone is driving my crazy at home, im going to get out of there. besides my mom will still help with financial stuff like food and shit. oh yeah on top of all this i am sick because of victors friends. my throat is scratchy and im caughing all the time i get sweaty when its cold and im seeze a lot. i really feel like shit and i hate the world right now. victors leaving me for a few days to go work in albequerqe so hopefully hell come back with dough. well peace out.

im stuck here at school. actually i didnt feel like going home because i would get bored. i think i will work on some home work. well in drama class we have to give a presentation on a play. Ha Ha RObin Death of a Salesman was in that list but everyone chose Author Miller. So that was out of the question. I chose to do Angels In America by Tony Kushner or A Streetacar Named Desire: and Night of the Iguana  by Tennessee Williams. The topic for that one is the decline of the South and Sex versus spirituality. This presentation will be really intresting, I think. I havent been home in a few days. Everyones gettin mad cuz they cant find me. Thats cuz I was accepted into a crew with Elaine. Looks like life still hasnt changed. I dont think I will change my ways except I stoped doing drugs. I drink more now.Ill also have a better job than these people will but that doenst mean I am better than them..Just want more out of life. I kind of missed partying in a way. I dont know how you can do it Robin. But thats kool. I guess youd rather stay home and study and party later in life. Id get bored. Anywho. Power 102 was at the campus today collecting donations for Hurricane Katrina. I was listening to Buzz on the morning show on KLAQ and he made a good point. Since New Orleans is big on VOodoo what happend to the Voodoo dolls that they didnt save. HE thinks the ones that are floating will make the people that they made into a doll will drownd. Ha Ha. They were completely mocking it. Then they said that the River Iguanas from the zoo drownd but none of the other animals drownd. He didnt get that cuz the River Iguanas are water animals. I thought that was pretty funny. I met a guy from orleans on the bus today too. He was cool. Very Cute too. I recognized him because he was on the news when they were at the convention center. They got him an apartment in central over here by school and hes opening a barber shop on the north east.he said he wanted to get out of orleans because he wasnt happy. He said so far he likes el paso because its cultural. he also speaks for 4 languages:Portugeese, Chinese and French and his main lanuage English.. Next on the list Is Spanish and German. He said if you dont know different languages and things about computers that you will fall behind in society these days.thats why he wants to learn so many languages. I think he was right about that. I think he might have been at least 30. but he was hot. I wish him the best of luck. I want to ask for his number cuz he had a cell phone but he was about to get off the bus already. maybe i will run into him again. he was cool. well laters guys. oh yeah robin i found my id mom put it on the counter in the bathroom.

ha ha robin...... i doubt that victor would spend money on us hes too stubborn. hed rather spend it on pot or video games. actually next week im looking for a job as well. im tired of being broke. speaking of victor im pretty mad at him right now. hes trying to blame me for getting pregnate if i am. it was his fault just as well as it was mine. but we decided that if i am we'll be getting married cuz hes not going to leave me alone with a kid to raise. i told him he didnt have to but he said itd be really fucked up if he just left me. in a way i know i cant afford a kid but also im emotionally ready for one so i kind of hope i am. so there might be a husband in my near future.YEA. its about time. ive been having these weird symptoms though.my stomach gets stiff, im hungry all the time and im sleepy all the time.i also feel like im comming down with a cold or something,but that doesnt mean anything. my friend talisa had flu symptoms when she was pregnante and so did tarin. plus ive been seeing a lot of birth control commercials on tv and tv shows where people are pregnante, having a scare, or talking about having a kid.victors stressing about it so hes driving me crazy with it and i feel like i need a break. he was complaing about me going over there a lot, so hes gonna get what he wants. i think im going to tell him for awhile that we should see each other once a week or on the weekend. this morning was pretty shitty. i left the house to catch the bus at 7am and i ended up waiting for 1 1/2 hours and saw 4 buses across the street pass. no bus came to my stop though. it was about 9:30 when this guy asked if i need a ride so i asked him to take me to mesa so i could catch it. then the bus in downtown, the bus driver took 30 min because he need to change drivers, so i ended up getting to school at 11:30 and i missed class. i knew i was going to miss it and most people would have gone back home but i had an assignment to turn in. later im spending the night at victors cuz he wants me to. well laters all

well tarin thinks she is pregnate again. i can't believe it. why dont people use their brains anymore? she just gave birth to my goddaughter Emily June Yesko in Feburary, and she's already having another kid. it looks like she will be comming here in september. she's talking about having an abortion cuz she doesnt want to be changing diapers anymore then she needs too. also if her mom finds out she'll get kicked out of the house and she cant tell anyone according to john, Emily's daddy. hes so psycho. he needs to be locked up in a mental instiitution or something. I dont know what goes through his mind. she needs to get away from him. so what we have planned is when she gets her next check she will come down. she'll get it on the 3rd.she will have a little over $900.00 saved. so thats good. when she moves here thats when shell tell people shes having another kid. she was talking about not wanting to have it because at least her mom can help with Emily when she wants to get out once in a while. she said that she wanted to ""ROLL,"" at least once more. I only know that if she does that again she will go back to her old lifestyle. Its sad because shes gotten so far and i like her more when shes not on drugs. she has a really bad past and here she is about to fuck up again. it pisses me off and if she does drugs again i wont talk to her. its stupid and irrisponsible. she should be going back to school and working and making a better future for herself. i thought Emily had changed that for her but i guess not. she was talking about giving partying up for good, but looks like shes going to give in again because shes still hanging out with the same loosers. she swears she doesnt care about Chaz(her ex)anymore but yet she still goes to take care of Sierra and sleeps with him cuz the sex is still good. but i think she still cares about him cuz she wouldnt be going back and fourth to him. she still hangs out with this girl Lindsey we used to party with but yet she doesnt like her cuz shes two-faced, backstabbing bitch. i love tarin to death and stuff(shes my best friend), but im tired of the fact that she complains and complains and falls back to the same pattern she used to be in and doesnt get away from it. i guess the problem in CA is that you cant make it because the rent is so high and you need roommates and everyone parties till they end up dead. i guess its gonna take something tragic to happen to her to wake up and join the real world. i wish i could just go down and get her and bring her here to el paso. se la vi. i dont know what to do to help her and get her out of there. i really hope she comes down like she said she is going to. maybe if she doesnt i can get her away from that. well laters

I don't care what my mom wants me to do. She wants me to teach 3rd grade. No thankyou!!! I have always been intrested in teaching literature. In fact, I want to have a PH.D in it. I think that is what I am ment to do. This semester we are going to study a lot of Greek Lit. Right now I have to read the Oddessy.(I dont think I spelled that right). We are also going to read a lot of Roman Lit. Ha get this, at the end of the semester he said we have to read the beginning of the New Testement. Ha! Ha! Drama will be pretty intresting too. He hasn't told us what we will be reading, but its a lot of the same stuff.I am hoping to get better grades this semester. First of all since my intreste in English, and there's the fact I have a higer dosage of Adderal so I will be able to concentrate. This other medicine called Lexapro that Dr.Fenning gave me seems to really be helping too. Since I've been on it I have been really happy. At first I wasnt sure if I liked it cuz I'm so used to be angry all the time,(and no Mark, I asked her if they were signs of Bipolar and they aren't, just depression). I know I like feeling this way. I feel like a great deal of stress has been lifted off my chest. I also feel happy cuz I droped all the loosers I've been hanging around. I got away from them finally. I used to try to fit in but I've come to realization that I will never be in the popular crowd, but you know what!?! I don't give a rat. I'd rather just be kicking doing the things I want and not trying to please others,because then they expect more than I can give and get gready.As far as I know, all I want to do is excell and be successful.

I've been out of school for the past 2 weeks. I haven't updated my journal cuz my comp is getting fixed. Victor came home on the 4th of August. I was very happy about that. I missed him so much. He made me and Robin mad cuz I went to spend the day with him and she came over to his house with me to kick it. Michael came ocer about 9:30pm so me and robin went to eat. they met back up with us about 10:30pm and said theyd be back but michael came up with the idea of calling us on the phone saying Victor got arrested but in reality he wanted to drink with his friends. why didnt he just say that instead of making up that big seniero? I knew he was lying so I stayed and told his mom that prank he was playing. She was mad and lectured him and Michael. I told him if he pulled something like that again that I wouldnt be around to put up with his games and he better be on his best behavior. Michael said hed make it up to me . Victor still needs to make it up to Robin too. I was pissed.I hadnt seen him all summer and this is the shit he pulled. but other than that one incident things are pretty good. My baby already made it up to me. I spent 4 days at his house kicking it with him and his friends. I did that cuz it was the last week before school went back. Robin came over and kicked it on saturday with me cuz no one was able to get ahold of me for a few days. Sorry we didnt get to watch those movies. Bring em over this weekend if you aint doing anything. Hey also bring farenhight 9/11 i still want to watch that too. I have my first class at 10:00. I don't mind taking the bus here. it gave me a chance to find my way around central. It looks like Tarin is still comming here so i need to find my ass a job. im also working on studying drivers book so i can get my permit and liscense before shes here. i cant wait. i havent seen her in 3 yrs almost. well thats whats new with me. take care and good luck with your classes everyone!

This guy that looked vaguely fimilar came up to me and then i realized it was this guy from my past who had lived across the street named Andrew Galloway.I remember back in the day he had always tried to befriend me but i pushed him away and didnt want to get close to him because he was my brothers friend. i always had thought he was cute so i figured that it was my only chance to get him back in my life.he had left the city and i havent seen him in the past 7 or 8 years. anyways in the dream he came to me and started talking; hey how ya doing? hows Robert, is he still doing drugs etc. he was asking what i had been doing all these years. we decided to take off to another bar but tarin and that group she was with was there so we left. we went back to the old hose that he used to live in and it turned out his mom was still there(she really isnt). anyways we went back in and started making out. it was just this once that i would have my chance. i told him how i felt then he said he was just visiting here and he had to go back to dallas. he said he was going to be here for a week and that we can spend as much time together as possible. well my friend joey ended up comming to visit by surprise then we went to hang out at starbucks where i ran into andrew. joey said he had to go somewhere really quick and i ditched him to go hang out with andrew. turns out no matter where i went i would run into him. i woke up due to my alarm clock. after that dream i had been thinking about andrew all morning,wondering where he is at. if hes dead or alive.(he used to do heroin,and got my brother on drugs, but he was still a good guy). I kind of do miss him. i wish i could find him.if he hasnt died from a drug overdose or something hed be about 28. anywho,have a nice day."

well tarin and her mom finally convienced her moms boyfriend to let her move back in for a few months so she could save money and get things together. thats better for me because then i wont be strugglin with working a night job. i can get in as a sub in january after fall classes are over then go take some night classes. it would be so much easier. you know, i was watching this show last night called 30 days. its about this couple that goes around living different lifestyles that normal people live even though they have all this money. they had it taken away- everything, credit cards, cash, accounts. they were givin an amount of $400.00 which they had to get an apartment then budget the rest. they had to go look for minimum wage jobs so they could see how others survive living paycheck to paycheck. they made a couple of good points.Minimum wage hasnt been raised for 8 years and it was originally designed so that we could make it. its dissappearing because everything is going up in prices. they said its a fucked up government and they dont understand why people are turning this country into poverty. what i dont get is why people blame the government for unemployment. its not the governments fault. its theres. they have all these oppertunities to get an education. theres all sorts of money out there. grants,financial aid, loans, scholarships. if u are lazy and dont want to study, then of course thats the price you pay. No education=working 2 jobs and living paycheck to paycheck. People bring buisness not the government. it really pisses me off to see people so damn lazy and then they get away with help from the government. then people like my parents and i have to pay taxes so that all this stuff exists and we dont get help and have to struggle for an education. its so fucked up. i wish people would take advantage of what this country""land of the free"" has to offer instead of sitting on their fat lazy asses. here we are the richest country in the world and all people care about are drugs, gangs, drive-bys, and partying. i hope one day this all doesnt exisit and eveyone has to work for what they want like we do and are parents do. I honestly think its good that tarin sees that point of view. shes embarresed that emily is growing up out of wedlock and welfare. her sister is trying to get her to go back to austin but she aint. i hope she really does come down here because i can help her. i hope she uses her brain on that one. her sister uses her and throws her around like a dog. i hope she opens up her pretty blue eyes and realises how much i can help her make a better life for her and emily. im sure no one else would do this for her. not even her own family cuz they are all fucked up.I have been feeling better now that ive had some piece and quiet this past week. im still not ready to go out and stuff. i have to adimit that i havent had much sleep in the morning because these stupid people work on their yard constantly. its annoying to wake up to a lawnmoer. i even went to the library to get quiet but theres this stupid teacher in here with some kids that are really loud and cant get anything done. BLEH. Have a nice week.

I decided I am taking a break from everyone. Many people havent called in 2 days.Except Elaine and Mark. I decided I needed a break from ya'll. Its been nice to have time for myself and to be around my family. Im always out and about. I didnt do so well on my math test. I thought i would have. I guess i need to study harder. we have another test on tuesday. gonna start cracking on the extra credit. she gives a lot of it. Dad is pretty grumpy. I sometimes for get that he is sick and we argue a lot. I feel bad. He told mom he doesnt feel like he will be around at christmas. I hope he is. for some reason people die on the holidays in my family. My grandpa died on Fathers Day back in 1996. That was bad. Grandma died on Valenties Day before I was 6 years old. Anywho, I went to Val Verde to go explore. I didnt realize that campus was so damn big. I really hope Tarin moves to the eastside because it took me 2 hours to get there. its a better campus there. it has a gym and much bigger library. Well have a good day

But I passed and I think it was because of the paper on evolution I wrote and the Labs that helped me passed. Plus he dropped the lowest grade and gave a 5% curve. Im trying to get a A in math. i start tutoring today so hopefully i will get my gpa back up. In the fall im taking 3 english and 1 math so Im aming for a 3.5 then.  I'm also so happy cuz in 2 weeks my boyfriend will be back and my best friend Tarin Yesko, and her daugter Emily will be moving here when she gets her next check. I finally get to meet my goddaugher. I'm out looking for a job on the eastside since im taking classes there. I told her to get a place over there cuz it would be much easier for me. My Dad is also medically retired so theres little income comming in so i need to start working. Its time i am on my own anyways. I am 23 so i should be out of the house. My brother also apologized. I still keep my distance from him though so theres no fighting. When he is home i stay in my room. I cant wait till  i go to the eastside. I need a break from a lot of dumbasses that i used to hang around. I got my own life to worry about and shit to do and i really dont have the time anymore to be partying. Well time to head for tutoring. Im getting all the help i need for math. have a nice day.

I know what i need to do. I decided Im going to look for  a job on the eastside of town because i willbe going to val verde. it would be a lot easier for me just to be working there. i take the bus and i dont feel like doing a lot of travelling. I figured i can become friends with a person at work and give them gas money to take me home. once i pay my bills off  i might move over there to make it even easier. then i will get a car. I know its going to be tough but sooner or later i will have to be on my own anyways. i dont know what my mom is going to do with this house after dad dies so i need to have my ass covered. its hard when u have it so easy then something unexpected comes at ya and u have to have a good foundation set up and a lot of determination. anyhwho, im going to go work on some homework. its about 2:30pm cant sleep got a lot on my mind. Im so wishing my boyfriend was here. I miss him and need him so much. I cant wait till he comes back. 3 more weeks!!!I'll admit it now. I think I am in love with him.

Hes accused me of stealing his dvds, when I am never in his room. Did he ever think that it could be his fiance whom he thinks is so great but in reality according to everyone else she's a liar, a slut, and ditzy? Hes put her first, hes even treating Dad like shit and my father only has so much time left on this planet. After my dad passes on i dont even want to think about whats going to happen. My mom is so depressed and Robert is treating every1 like shit. He should be on his own hes 26 damn years old. I dont want anything to do with him. I dont want to see his face I dont want to talk to him. When i go out into the real world after Dad dies, I will only talk to mom. Robert will be out of my life. This has been a very shitty summer. I cant wait till I start classes at Val Verde. It will take up most of my day and i wont be home much. Anywho, laters every1!

I stayed home and cleaned out my room, got rid of stuff I really didnt need. I apologized to Victor. I think Ive been upset cuz he isnt here. I miss him so much. Well, school starts for me tomorrow for the second summer session. Dad looks pretty bad. He doesnt do anything but sleep. He slept till about 4pm today. He came into the kitchen and he almost looked like a ghost. His skin so pale. Im very sad that he's dying if he doesnt get his transplant. My mom is completely depressed.I wish I could help out somehow. I try to help around the house as much as possible. Reality sucks these days. I'm doing the best I can to get everything right, I know time is running out before I will be on my own.I feel that there is never enough time for everything. I feel like screaming so loud.

He said he was going to get a job, but he hasnt been doing anything but playing video games. we've been arguing everytime we are online. it got me going crazy. if all he wants to do over there is play video games, so be it. He wont hear from me for the rest of the summer. I told him just to call when he gets back. Hes really pissed me off. It hurts. How do u make someone care about u the way u care about them. I always told myself I wouldnt let love get in the way of thingss,but it has. I wasnt able to concentrate in school and i dont think i did well in geology this summer. I'm lost dont know what Im doing anymore. Dad was in the hospital and my moms on my case about my major. Its not her fucking future, shes not going to be alive 40 years from now. I wish everyone would let me just be at peace. I'm tired of the world, and tired of the bullshit. No matter how hard I try or what I do, its never good enough. I'm so sick of it. Well have a good 4th of july. I wont be here this weekend. leaving to Phoenix tonight. I'll be back on tuesday.

""you need to loose weight, you need a job, you need to do this, you need to do that."" I'm sick of it. everyday. she expects shit to happen overnight. screw that shit.it really gets annoying because she has one of those New York squeeky accents. ive really had it living there. i know im lucky to have my mom helping me right now but i only can do so much. i think i need a break from people. they are really starting to piss me off these days. i wish they werent uptight.i really need a vacation. i cant wait till the road trip next summer. well, im off. gotta go to class then im gonna go smoke some bud.

well, yesterday i slept the whole afternoon because i didnt sleep again the night before since i was studying for a test. I think I did pretty well on it too. As for the job in the mall, I could never get ahold of the manager for my schedule, so I guess I might as well look for another job. It sucks to because I had already filled out the W2 Forms. Whatever. There's about 2 more semesters for me here at EPCC. I'm supposed to graduate in May if I pass everything. If that's the case, I am going to take a summer vacation off. I've worked my ass off but it still took me a long time because I had to take remedial courses before I could get credit for the classes. If it wasnt for that, I would have been done already. Anywho, a friend or two and I are planning a road trip for the summer. We'll be on the road for 3 months. What I want to do is save up some money and follow String Cheese around the southwest and west coast. I think the first stop I am going to go is to see my best friend in Oceanside,CA for 2 weeks, then kick it in San Francisco for 2 weeks and say hi to some people, go up to Humbolt County(perferrably Arcata and Gerberville)for Reggae on the River(3 day reggae festivle),then up to Oregon for the Greatful Dead Festivle, and back down to Colorado and Nevada for Burning Man. I'm going to start making clothes and jewelery between now and next year so I could sell them and make some money while on the road.Sounds like a good deal? Anywho, anyone who's wanting to go, is welcome. I ask for 3 things, you gotta be friendly, have some cash saved up(for gas and food),and be all about chillin and be patient. If you've never done this before, you gotta take a sleeping bag, most important things(not a lot of clothes, toilitries), remember, we'll also be doing a lot of camping and a lot of hiking so you'll wanna pack lightly. We'll have room to stock up on stuff, but plan on doing some odd jobs to make cash if you need it. thats why im gonna start making my own products to sell them. anywho, the more the merrier.
Happy Travels if your going anywhere this summer,

I've decided to put my personal life on hold and concentrate on school for now. A lot of people that I have been hanging around have been bringing me down. Currently because of the partying that I've started doing again, has made my life go back to the way it used to be. Right now I feel like a ghost to everyone again. If that's how its gonna be then that's how I'm gonna start acting. I know who my True friends are but I could care less about everyone else. I feel alone right now and I guess I'm happier that way. I need to concentrate on only myself and worry about what Victor's doing when he comes back. The summer is going to be for me to spend time with myself and do what I need to do. It will be better for me because it will give me time to change and be a new person for the fall. Today I ran into a childhood friend of mine from middle school that lived down the street from me(Michelle Rojas.) I havent seen her in years. We were catching up on old times and exchanged numbers. She can't party much now cuz she has a baby, but thats cool, you dont have to party to have fun. We're gonna hang out sometime soon. I missed her and often thought where she went after she moved to Santa Teresa. I'm glad I ran into her. She befriended me when I needed a friend back in the day. Anywho, I will keep my journal updated, but if you guys dont hear from me you know the reason why. The way I see it, if you want to keep in contact you'll holla at me.

well i know its been a while since i updated my journal(I had problems with my computer at home). I am back in school for the summer so now I can keep it updated. Here's what's been going on; Victor(my boyfriend) went to San Antonio for the summer. I've been bummed out. I am so not used to him being gone this long, and I am used to hearing his voice on the phone. I'll admit, I am getting used to him not being here now. Watch, I bet as soon as I am completely used to him not being here, he'll be back. I've been having fun though because now that he's gone I can go out and party and have some space. In a way I feel we needed time apart. I'm happy because I hooked my Dear Friend RObin up with a good guy by the name of Josh whom I've known for a long time. I'm glad to see that she's happy because that's all I want for my friends is for them to be happy. Well, I haven't found a job yet but I have enough credits to get in EPISD as a teacher's aid. Maybe I will find a job this summer so I can keep my mind off of Victor being gone instead of drinking my misery away. Anyways, have a good summer everyone.

I was hoping to go see Tarin in San Bernandino,CA. but shes having 2 roommates move in because her boyfriend wants his friend there. She's lived with them before and she doesnt like them because you cant rely on them for rent. She said her friend Amber gets $800 a month for SSI and she spends $700 in a week/saves the other $100 for food and her baby, then muches off for the rest. THat aint right.I'm glad I still live at home and get things for free. Well laters

My aunt gave me $100.00, my mom bought me clothes, and took me out to lunch. I am now 23 years old. TOday, my mom got me some more clothes and I also got a membership to Curves. Its a great deal for students.$99 for the semester. I really like the enviornment. It's small and its mainly women that are in it so I feel comfortable. I made the choice of eating healthier and now I am making the next choice of exercising. I'm not going to give up on this cuz I want to get toned and such for the summer. I'm so happy I finally got my life back to the way it was. It was so hard to get back to the way it used to be before I fucked up. My goal is to loose 30 pounds for now then work on another goal later. I'm so full of life right now. Tomorrow I will be going to Curves for a 1st workout at 4:00pm. They only let you workout for 30 minutes untill your body gets used to it. 30 minutes/3times a week. THen when I get back I am going to church at 6:30 to pray for our POPE, John Paul 2. Its so sad that he passed away, but he lived a good life. Well laters

I want to travel again when I have money. I'm in the mood to take a lot of risks such as Mountain climbing, bunge jumping and so fourth. I'm in the mood to start taking better care of my health.,I've been eating nothing but healthy foods all weekend. Maybe that's why I feel so energized and happy. I want to exercise, maybe practice yoga. I feel like striving for the best of things. I'm taking more pride in my stuff.

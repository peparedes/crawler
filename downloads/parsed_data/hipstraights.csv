1.) everything is hilariously, even dangerously, funny.  I spent about 10 minutes engaged in a serious belly laugh yesterday because rp made some crude noises with his mouth. my abs hurt for hours afterward. 
2.) memory lapses occuring during optimum times.  I don't remember my ride on the subway this morning. at all. which is nice, because my dealings with the cta are typically the least pleasant part of my day. 
3.) I have to work constantly, with zero breaks, in order to keep from falling asleep. I'm really getting a lot done. 

possible cons:
1.) modern technology makes very little sense to me.  it took me six tries to access my voicemail this morning. as it turns out, pressing and holding the ""clear"" button on a cell phone won't do it.  
2.) my face has become an even whiter shade of pale.  I'm starting to worry that people will soon be able to see through to my molars and sinus cavities.

Czislowski was playing for Brisbane team Wynnum during the April 1 incident involving Tweed Heads forward Matt Austin. He had a head wound stitched up afterward, the Australian Associated Press reported Tuesday.

Czislowski later suffered an eye infection and complained of lethargy and shooting pains in his head.

Then last week, his doctor found a tooth imbedded in Czislowski's head.

""I can laugh about it now, but the doctor told me it could have been serious, with teeth carrying germs,"" Czislowski said.

""I've got the tooth at home, sitting on the bedside table,"" he said. ""If he [Austin] wants it back he can have it. I'm keeping it at the moment as proof that it actually happened."""

R. KELLY | Rapper, still up on child porn charges, compares himself to slain civil rights leader 

May 17, 2007
BY LESLIE BALDACCI lbaldacci@suntimes.com 
R. Kelly compares himself to Muhammad Ali, Marvin Gaye, Bob Marley -- and even Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- in a magazine interview that hits the street just in time for the release of his new album this month.

Kelly, the Chicago native who rose from street singer to star before facing criminal charges of having sex with an underage girl, made the comments in the spring/summer issue of Hip-Hop Soul magazine. 
 
R&B singer R. Kelly's interview and photo shoot for Hip-Hop magazine took place a month ago in Chicago. 
(AP file) 
The magazine had not reached newsstands Wednesday, but the Sun-Times received an advance copy. 
The most eyebrow-raising quote: ""I'm the Ali of today. I'm the Marvin Gaye of today. I'm the Bob Marley of today. I'm the Martin Luther King, or all the other greats that have come before us. And a lot of people are starting to realize that now."" 

The blogs quickly picked up the scent after the New York Post ran the quote. 

Hiphop.popcrunch.com attributed the quote to ""swollen-headed R. Kelly."" Crunk & Disorderly (crunktastical.blogspot.com) ran the quote under the category ""All Types of Wrong."" 

Kelly's publicist, Regina Daniels, said the interview and photo shoot took place in Chicago about a month ago. 

""He doesn't think he's Martin Luther King. He's comparing the fact that he is a prolific songwriter of his time; now it's turned into something else,"" Daniels said. ""Whatever Rob said, any way they can stick it to him. If he breathes it's a problem."" 


To appear in court Friday
The interview -- along with a photo shoot -- took place in the presidential suite of Hotel Sofitel Chicago Water Tower, according to the magazine. The article calls Kelly ""our generation's answer to Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye"" and ""an ambidextrous soul genius."" Kelly's quote came in response to this comment from the interviewer: ""The things that have been written about you would make lesser men wither or simply want to give up . . ."" 
And Kelly's reply also includes this comment: ""So I have to walk with a certain humility. I have to walk with love in my heart for those that hate me. I have to. I have to get out and touch people in order for me to continue to feel the pulse of the world."" 

The Rev. James Meeks, the state senator who ministered to Kelly during the early days of his legal case, quoted Scripture: ""We should be careful about praising ourselves and leave that to other people. That would be my admonition."" 

Kelly spokesman Allan Mayer protested the way the quote was lifted in the Post. ""What I would suggest to anybody who is put off by that quote is read the entire interview, which I think much better reflects what Rob was trying to say."" 

Kelly will appear in court again Friday for the latest hearing in a case that started nearly five years ago. 

Kelly is charged with 14 counts of child pornography for allegedly videotaping himself engaging in sex acts with an underage girl. 

The Cook County state's attorney's office filed the charges in June 2002 after the Sun-Times turned over a videotape it received anonymously following an article about underage girls suing Kelly for allegedly engaging in sexual relationships with them. Those suits were all settled out of court.""


Also, I'm not buying your act, dude.  If you were really that heartbroken over your girl, you would be unshaven and sloppy, crying in bed at 9:00 a.m.  Instead, you are polished and shiny, with your beat samples and second-rate Brian McKnight style, lamenting to sleepy 9-5ers in the subway. 

I'm not buying it."

http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/19/commentary.nugent/index.html

completely arbitrary (and slightly xenophobic) arguments aside, my dislike of ""the nuge"" formed much earlier, on an otherwise uneventful fall day.  I was waiting tables in cadillac, when ""the nuge"" walked in.  he was in the neighborhood hunting, of course.  all of the cooks were flipping their shit, and kept hassling me about him every time I walked into the kitchen.  I'll admit, I didn't know who ""the nuge"" was until someone hummed a few bars of ""cat scratch fever"" for me.  when he ordered the prime rib, I followed up with the standard question ""how would you like that cooked?""  he grabbed my hand, looked me straight in the eye and said: ""honey, I want it as raw as it gets.""  

I was seventeen, and couldn't wait to go home and take a shower.

so, yeah - for some funny reason, it's difficult for me to read commentary by ""the nuge"" and take it any more seriously than if it was written by, say, Ted ""Theodore"" Logan:

can someone please explain why swimsuits are so preposterously expensive?  they subsist of significantly less material than most other articles of clothing, yet cost much, much more.  is lycra some sort of rare material, that can be mined in only select locations in the world?  does it require chemists working around the clock with volatile materials to create just one lycra molecule?  is the nude-colored lining of the suit spun from gold?  why should I pay nearly $80 for something when I live in the midwest, and the chances I will have to wear it are dependent entirely upon one of the most fickle weather systems in the world?  more importantly: where in the #### is the swimsuit that I paid nearly $80 for two summers ago, wore once in december in the southern hemisphere, and then lost sight of forever?!

I don't want to die in Disney World, or have my last day on earth involve Disney World or any other theme park full of people in tube tops and bicycle shorts, and wearing fanny packs (and not because fanny packs have come back into style, either - these people never stopped wearing the fanny packs).  I do not want my obituary to read: ""Age 24, died of roller coaster"".

Also, I'm fairly certain that the human body has not yet evolved to the point of being able to be ""subjected to 2 G's"" worth of force without any ill effects.  I understand that astronauts can be ""subjected to"" such force, but they are ASTRONAUTS.  They are in peak physical condition, and they train for months at a time, all the while being closely monitored by physicians.  They are not simply on vacation, hanging out, in all of their fanny-packed glory, in line for an hour for the chance to ""experience space"" by being spun out of control in a centrifuge. 

Now that I think about it, this ride could just as easily be called ""Mission: DNA sample,"" since patrons are spun and spun just like some blood or semen found at a crime scene.

I had an example in mind, modeled after the one my grandmother has been using for years (when she can find it).  the model that a nice, young sales girl found for me at target was this enormous beast of a thing, with not only a cutting function, but also a crushing function, which I found to be superflous.  it also cost $5.99 (!).  so we moved on from target, and headed to walgreens.  there I found a simpler model, which fit nicely into my price range.  

now, if the above commentary wasn't enough to convince you that I am, indeed, an overly cautious and frugal elderly woman trapped in a relatively young woman's body ( and my sense of style hasn't convinced you of this fact in the past), then consider this:  my reason for purchasing the pill cutter in the first place was to multiply my medication supply by two, thus stretching a three-month supply over six months, and saving $14.00.

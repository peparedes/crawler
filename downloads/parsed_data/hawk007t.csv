well my pos is working again.  Let's seeeeeeee...my ex calls me up late Friday night for starbucks, she ends up sleeping in my bed until 4am because her current guy got tired of her moving around in his.  I'm too nice.  Mixed my alcohol quite a bit last night and surprisingly I didn't get sick.  Especially after the second ""scooby snack."" Caught 5 people today.  I get to sleep in tomorrow...unless freaking MCI decides to call me at 8am like they have been.  Stupid f***, you get the machine, leave a message."

If there is a hell, the area code is 925.  I made the mistake of giving somebody my cell phone number, and now she won't stop calling.  Stupid is as stupid does.  I run into an old friend last night who said he was driving through Concord and saw a homeless bum on the street with a sign asking for money for food.  At first glance, he thought it was me, so much so he had to take a harder second look.  He even showed his concern to his wife and my friend Paul.  What did I tell him when he told me this? ""If only I was that lucky."""

It was nice to finally catch two girls tonight for trying to take some jewelry when we hadn't gotten anybody all week.  One entered with no earrings on and tries to exit with earrings on and she still tries to lie.  Ok......Went to a farewell party tonight.  I was the only single person there. Ok......I hate parties when it's all couples, well I guess I wouldn't mind if I wasn't the only single person there.  Ex called to tell me she bought a new dog.  Well, her and her ""guy"" bought a new dog but she doesn't want to phrase it that way to me.  She says I should buy the same type of dog she did because it likes to answer to only one person.  Ok....., yes I'm aware I'm single, would you like to rephrase.  Still wondering why, if she dumped me to hang out with another guy every available minute of her time, why she still calls me everyday. Especially right before she goes to bed every weeknight.  I've drank three days in a row now, because...well....how can you not drink if you're gambling in reno and well...how can you not drink when you're gambling at a farewell party.  Tomorrow I will end thy drought and hit the water bottle hard.  Would be nice to cuddle, however I must settle for my body pillow.

"event","I havent updated in a while and since I have some things I need to get of my chest I thought it was the perfect time to do so. I swear that I have some really fucked up paranoia issues and I need to chill out. Since a boyfriend I had a few years ago, I have always been worried that every guy will cheat on me. Alex (my current boyfriend) is an incredible guy and I love him tons ,as he does in return, but I wont let my worries rest. Many of my actions are straining the relationship and I know if I dont knock it off he will get tired of my games. Hes a member of myspace.com and since Im a snooping bitch sometimes I went on his profile. What did I find, you ask? Well, he said that he was in a serious relationship but also says he is looking for a relationship of sorts. Hmmm? I asked him and he said he forgot to change it. This could be true. Maybe I should just let all my worries rest? My constant paranoia can drive him to cheat since I know the theory that if you are constantly getting accused of something you mind as well do it. I NEED to chill out but I cant. Im starting to think that maybe my birth control is having an effect on my mental state. Its a known side effect and I have noticed since starting taking it that I have become alot more bitchier. I need to get my act together and quick!"

"event","WTF to Deliahs! The Diamond G-String show was going to be awesome but NOOOOOOOOOOO they had to be douche bags! ROOOOOOOOOAR! I have a weird feeling that a little bit of sabotage is going on but hey, thats maybe just me being paranoid. Whatever, fuck it! 
Beside that life has been going quite smoothly. Theres been a few bumps in the road but nothing I couldnt handle. I'll get more into details later!

"event","Hey! So life has been very interesting latetly, but it always is! Had a boyfriend but that  wasnt going the way I wanted to. Im planning to go on the road for 2 years so what would be the point anyway? Why have to deal with a huge heartbreak later? Dude doent get my reasoning though so I had to be harsh but then again I love being a bitch sometimes! Now I have to deal with being trashed on his livejournal. Thats fine but I will tell my side. Anyway, the website is getting a HUGE makeover and tons of new pics! YAY!!!! Im gonna run along for now but I'll talk soon... xoxox Fallon Fox"

"event","why is it that when you talk to someone they act like they are your friend and act like they want to hang out with you, but then the next day they talk to someone else and say crap about you? Or why is it that even though you say nothing about anyone and stay out of gossip and all the freakin drama, that you still get pulled into it without doing anything? Why are there so many people that use each other to get something they want? Why cant everyone stop being bitches to each other? Why can't you be on a team without someone being mean to someone? Why can't you ever have a conversation with someone without them bringing up someone's name? Why can't people stop talking about people behind their backs? Why do i feel so alone even when i'm surrounded by friends? Why cant anyone be honest, instead of being a liar who pretends? Is everyone in the world pretend? Does everyone wear a label? Why doesn't school ever get easy? Why can't i just go about one day without something that i dont like happening? Why is there a chemistry test tomorrow? Why the hell do i ask so many questions that i know will never be answered?"

"event","Well we cut out trip to the bahamas short. The seas were good today and because of the storms that were heading in we decided the crossing would be best today. So we did lol. Uhm we got got palm beach and my mom and i went to get our car and it turns out the valet at the Cloud X is only there when the Cloud X is at port. So pretty much my mom and i found our car and drove it off the lot. lol. we basecially stole our car. We did call them later to let them know. That was a pretty highlighted moment there. i fell asleep in the car back home. then i got here and yah. I never made it to the beach this trip. We left friday and came back today so. i walked down the beach and stuff and we went to lucaya and freeport but other than that i didn't get to lay on the beach so it was pretty sucky. Hopefully we'll go back next month and i can actually relax on the beach haha. alright well kyle's back in town from college. Him and Chelsea are downstairs hanging out so thats pretty cool. Alright thats it for tonight.

They sold it a couple years back. We went on the website tonight and found that the new owners had redone like everything. The room that my family always stayed in is now green and the furniture is all moved. The parlor where we had christmas was changed. We used to have the fire place lit and the old wood floors would creek when we walked on them early in the morning, but no! those mean people had to change it. haha oh well. I'll never go there probably. And if i do, I'll have to give them a piece of my mind for changing a place where I practically grew up in. Anyway I wanna know if anyone has classes with me so here's my schedule. Let me know if i have anything with you!!!! haha

"event","Well i went to dinner last night with my mom after shopping where i saw
Chelsea (kyle is a loser and wouldnt go with her) and radler with two
other guys. but anyway we went to dinner at red lobster because i
really wanted crab. So the lady comes back with the meals and she
handed me a scallop and lobster ""chop"" thing. I told her it wasn't
right so she said she'd put the correct order for my crab legs and i
can just eat what she gave me and she wont charge us or whatever. So my
mom and i ate it and the lady came back with the check and i was like i
still haven't gotten my crab. And she was like well did you tell anyone
you wanted it still? and i was like I told YOU! So then next came the
manager who was asking everyone if dinner was okay. so i told her what
had happened. and she brought me out half a pound, even though i wanted
a pound. So when she brought it to me she asked if i wanted another
half a pound, so i said yes. Then later the check came again and i
still hadn't gotten the other half a pound. So instead of going on
about the crab i ordered a piece of cake. And they brought that to me
luckily. and it turned out i only got charged for half a pound of crab
legs, a drink, and a coke. So it was pretty cool. Confusing, but cool.
Maybe you had to be there, but it was funny. Turns out i ate clam
chowder, part of my mom's salad, some lobster, some scallops, some
fries, half a pound of crab, and a big piece of chocolate cake. life is
good. :o)
<br>
<br>
Tomorrow i'm going shopping in the morning and then going to jaymee's
house!!!!! We're going to the Howie Day concert and shelby, sara kent,
and i'm pretty sure michelle enger are coming too. I'm so excited and i
can't wait!!! yay hahah alright cya"

So Kate, being extremely stupid, decides to say that if she was to turn goth she'd know where to go. But she didn't just say it. She pretty much yelled it. so many people looked at us. I thought we might get beat up! There was this really hott guy in FYE though. Pink polo and trucker hat. B-E-A-utiful. Then we tried almost every perfume in Dillards with the lady telling us which were her favorite and least favorite. That entertained us for 20 minutes. We also read to each other in barnes and noble in the litle kids section. but we got bored so kate went to the love and sex section. They have a book for everything, and let's leave it at that. And then we went to gators. It was fun. I had a pretty good day watching movies lol.

*FYI- the movie for the great gatsby is a tad different from the book, we found that out"

Katherine said she wasn't gonna cry but after she told me her eyes filled with tears-that's cute..jp Katherine. It was so weird seeing Kyle and all his friends today. I've known them for so long its really crazy. The graduation was fun and I took a lot of pictures of Kyle going up to get his certificate thing. They don't give you the diploma during the assembly. You get it after. So yah. I got a million pictures of all of kyle's friends. Everyone was crying when Zane(sorry if that's spelled wrong-i dont think he'll see it anyway) started crying when he was giving his speech. Afterwards was so hot. Mom took a ton of pictures and we were all burning up. I saw a few people. That was cool. Oh and Natalie...I was cracking up when Kelly Katherine ******* was called up on stage. All I could think about was last night! haha. Alright well all the family is coming over for dinner, grilling steaks. If we eat outside I think I'll just play lacrosse. My goal if finally set up! One of my dad's clients who does a lot of our repairs came over and set it up for me. I'm happy. Alright well I'm gonna go see what's going on with everyone.

I borrowed money from pretty much everyone in there to make copies of Kaylen's notes. I came home and studied history and bio. Had a LONG conversation with kate. Came up with the funniest plan ever. I think it's on my top 20. ""Then I got to thinking about it. It started out as a little spark. but i blew harder on it and it almost became a wildfire! and then someone dumped water all over it and her name is evil, pure evil!"" haha that was so great kate!!! After dinner my mom and i watched jeapordy and it was so funny. i got 3 answers right. There was something on there from the Odyssey. The category was crossword T where every word started with a T. The question was what was Odysseus and Penelope's son's name? And I knew it was Telemachus. Then there was this question with some Gulf and I only know a couple so i guessed Gulf of Mexico and it was right. Then there was this question about where the land got smaller than bigger and it was an isthmus...and Jerome(guy on the show) answered..
Me: I bet it's somewhere between North America and South America!
Mom: You mean Central America?
Me: Yah that's it!
Jerome: What is the Gulf of Panama
Mom: Oh My God..
Me: That's in Central America!!!!!!!

I guess you probably had to be there but it was great. Anyway I have my English exam tomorrow. I'm going to be so happy when this week over! But then I shall cry come the weekend because Kyle graduates..so sad. :o( So that's it for now. I worked out a whole plan so maybe i'll pass my exams. I'll update sooner or later.

"event","Well last night we lost 4-3, which sucked because i really wanted to beat those girls because they were so mean. This one girl slashed me and knocked me over, hit my head, and made my stick hit the ground twist up and hit her in the face. She should have gotten a red card, but of course the refs wouldn't call anything in our favor...instead they took three of our goals away, which is in the rule book if i am correct that we should have kept the goals if the foul that was made was in our favor. But the refs won't allow that..of course not. Annelise, Hannah, and Kate all got yellow cards. We weren't catching that great but neither were they. I don't know I wish we could've won. Anyway so far today I've finished my math and got my whole english project set up and completed. All i have left is my history study guide and to read 63 pages in 1984. I switched out my printer with my mom's and shee's getting a new one. And now my printer is good for all my photos and works a lot better. I'm so excited about it. I'm about to go look at all the marvelous things i managed to buy on Thursday and put them all away now that I'm finally by myself. It's lonely since I've been with friends almost everyday this break. But now I can finally get organized again. Last night after the game we went to dinner with Kate, Craigory, Pamela, and Kates uncle and aunt. It was funny. I felt sick at the beginning because of the game but after I ate i felt better and it was so much fun. T-I- double guh-ER..Idiot kate, idiot. HAHAHAHA wow your face was so funny when you walked out of the bathroom and that was the first thing I said to you. Well a recap of my week is that on Tuesday we had a game and won, i forget the score, and after the game i spent the night at Kates with Sarah. On Wednesday the three of us went to the beach and ran into a lot of people. Kacia got her picture taken with three hot guys lol. Thursday i went shopping with my mom and then to a movie with Jen where we ended up hanging with david, michael, michael's cousin, and tomei. That was funny. And at the end of the movie we were hanging with michael and his cousin cuz david and tomei had to go. And there were these 8th graders who were extremely retarded. And after michael and his cousin left. The two girls that were 8th graders called us a very mean name...and then the two guys that were with them tried to hit on us. We just turned away (they weren't cute anyway..rather ugly). So yah. All in all I had a good break. There's only one more lacrosse game left..so sad. I don't want the season to be over yet. It's so crazy. School is almost over! I'm excited, but i know that exams are coming. Not fun!!!!! Alright well I'm gonna go eat and start working on my study guide. Hope everyone else had a good break..it's not over yet!"

Life's pretty cool, school is a mess and stressful as usual but that never changes so its no surprise. Lacrosse has been going great!! 7-1 oh yah! Melanie is in washington for tomorrow's game but we still have Izzy, thank god those rumors of her quiting weren't true. I'm sure she'll do great in goal, but we'll have to help her out a lot. Attack- job to keep ball on our side of the field. Defense: Keep the other team away from the goal. I dont care how ya do it, but if they're away from the goal they can't score. Well that's a great plan lol. I'm sure coach and other people have a better one, but that's how i put it into simple terms. Hopefully you can come watch, 5:30 tomorrow at home and stay for the guys game!! Yesterday at practice was funny. Since the lightning bell went off we weren't allowed to practice so we had to stay in the wrestling hut watching the weightlifting thing that was going on. Other schools were there too. Coach Kelly showed up with popsicles and Kate made this comment about it probably being hard for the guys to focus with a team of lacrosse girls eating popsicles. So we all started joking around about licking the popsicles in a ""seductive way"". haha. So kate goes kerry do it. So i did as i was turning around. And as soon as i finished it and we started laughing 2 guys walked up to me and asked if we had any extra popsicles. We couldn't stop laughing. Wow it was funny, you probably had to be there..and hugh hurt himself twice. Allie hit him ""there"" when she was shooting on him in goal, and then he came out to guard me and ended up sliding on the wet grass and doing a split which hurt him again. poor hugh. anyway that's pretyt much it. i'm gonna go study for biology. I'll study, but it wont do any good, so i dont know how much i'll study lol. cya xo"

"event","it's really weird how things can be going one way and randomly change. last night was awesome and the game was cool to watch. i knew guys and girls were different, but they are almost completely 99% different. The 1% referring to both of them being called lacrosse. After the game, too bad they lost, sarah, kaitlin n, and i went to winter park village and ate at cheesecake factory. so good!! it was the funniest night. we kept hitting our heads on the booth seats and the window when we were laughing really hard. it was fun having our ""long and deep"" conversations haha. After dinner we saw jen, jenny, and lauren o. Kaitlin left, so sarah and i hung out with them, until sarah left. And i stayed with them for like 10 minutes before leaving. Then this morning Sarah called me and told me about her dog having cancer. I know why she chose to call me since i'm going through the same thing. I think our dogs both have the same cancer, excpet my dog's hasnt kicked in yet, it will in a couple months. I hope their dog survives, because i already know mine wont. which makes me so unbelievably sad. my body still feels numb since the vet and my mom told me. Anyway i finished doing all the calculations for my math project and catherine is drawing it up. i still have to study math and spanish, but i'll get to it. Today is so nice out. If only it was 50 degrees. i love cold wet days. My favorite weather. But its hot and rainy. it was nice to go to sleep last night to the sound of rain. so cozy lol. oh, but the reason why i started off saying how things can change is because last night was so great and to wake up and hear sarah in tears is completely different then seeing her laughing so hard and hitting her head on the booth seat. i know exactly what she's feeling and how even though you try to get your mind off of it, it comes back to you and keeps replaying in your head over and over and over again until you realize there's no fast forward and no rewind to when things werent crazy. Lately life is kind of a blur. Somehow i manage to get through it lol. But people ask so what did you do last wee, and i dont remember. hmm.. so much stuff to think about. but i did come to a conclusion on a big problem i'm facing. it's a sucky conclusion but it's the only thing to do. which makes no sense but oh well. alright well i'm done. thats my life right now haha. so so interesting..cya xo"

We definitley didn't win considering we were up against Neha (sorry if that's spelled wrong) and Varun. So at most we came in thrid? I don't know if we'll place. Find out tomorrow. We'll all be showing up late from the lacrosse game and walking in in our uniforms and all sweaty. Luckily i finished doing everything I missed yesterday and I only have to do my extra credit assignment for bio. But my mind is just going crazy (kate! too much pressure from it all!! i can't choose lol). Homework isn't what's causing my brain to hurt anymore. Luckily..Mrs. Knight is in the hospital, so Miss Chapelle is subbing for us. So far i like her. Courtney and I understand what's going on now lol. Lunch yesterday after science fair was so great. We sabataged(how do you spell that?) everyones drink at least once, colored, played dumb games, listen to courtney and caitlin sing about lesbians, angels dieing, and their boyfriend turning gay, fought over desserts, tricked nekisa(i cant spell tonight) by taking her straw and filling it with salt and then telling her lets have a chugging contest, her face was so great. I didn't have money so Cameran payed for me. THANKYOU CAMERAN!! haha. I feel so bad for the waiters who had to clean up that table. it was such a mess and destroyed. so my life is pretty good right now lol. Just some choices to make, but that's nothing new. Hopefully sammie and i will place tomorrow, doubtfull yes, but fingers crossed. Hopefully we'll win lacrosse, fingers still crossed. What shall come of tomorrow i have no idea. i'm gonna go eat and do my project and think cya xo"

"event","well i went to the modeling thing yesterday. i was sittin gthere for 10 minutes and then found out we had to go in as a group, walk the cat walk, and do so many things and that it was going to take a while and i didnt feel like doing it, so i left. haha. there goes that idea. maybe if i wanted it bad enough, which i didnt, i wouldve spent my day doing it, but that's alright. Last night was funny. At around 11:30 kyle was really bored and so was i, and we ended up taking like 200 pictures of him doing random stuff. he took pictures of himself upside down. everytime i went to take a picture i could burst out laughing and he would be off centered. i seriosly started crying i was laughing so hard. Then we looked at all the people who have myspace and laughed at that a little. then i helped him get into bed with the leg. By the end of it all it was 1:00. such a good night. The dog gets his stitches out tomorrow and he'll probably be feeling better. Kyle says he'll drive to school tomorrow, which is stupid and wont happen considering its his right leg that he had surgery on. i'm not seeing it working out too well. He can't bend it and it's heavy to move, i don't see this working. Mom won't let him anyway so oh well. ok that's it for my life cya haha"

"event","alright well tomorrow is my math test..hmm..sam helped me a lot in study hall and i just got off the phone with her reteaching me. i feel better than i did, but i'm still having trouble getting all these formulas down. I have a vocab test tomorrow and have to do workbook pages with them, but i left that in my locker so i'll be going early tomorrow to study and do them, since i have english first period. Well kyle is still recovering, and today my dog went into surgery. He's cool, he's staying the night at the vet and we pick him up tomorrow. Poor mom, she has two people/dog to take care of this week. I would help but i'm way too freaked about geometry!! If i get moved down it will be a blessing. i'm going to the basketball games this friday. i might stay after practice with kate and just go to the game rather than going home. we shall see. saturday i have an interview with a modeling agency, i know, i didn't see that coming either, believe me!! I never really saw myself as a model...they probalby won't either lol. so those are my two plans for this weekend. maybe i'll go to the movies saturday night. hmm..i'm still worried about math tomorrow. i'll be in 3rd period regular geometry if i do bad..not sure if that's good or not. next year i'll do non-honors but i dont know right now. i want to move down, but if i'm capable of honors then i dont think i should. i'll just have to wait and see. We moved seats in spanish today. i'm mad. i liked my seat. i was hidden from mrs. calvert. behind courtland, big football player, couldn't see me. now i'm going to be called on more because i'm on the other side of the room and lance i think took my seat. best seat in the classroom. upsetting really. ok well i'm gonna go study cya"

"event","Well Kyle had his leg surgery today. It went well but he had a big tear so he has a screw in his leg and he's going to be out of baseball for 6 weeks due to rehab and crutches. that's all to mercado for jumping on his back..wow. I got a 100 on bio and a 92 on digital imaging. we ended up not having our spanish quiz because she wasnt there and we had a sub. Tomorrow we should be taking it. I also have a history test tomorrow. I'm still waiting to get out of honors geometry, mrs. knight still hasn't emailed Ms. Ozman about where i ""stand"" in the class. Oh well, i have to get out of there sometime. Probably after thursday's test and after the lab is turned in, which i've only done 1 problem so we'll see how that goes. Lacrosse wasn't bad. Yesterday was more fun probably because i was hyper yesterday and today i was tired. We did a lot of left hand throwing and catching and passing and pretty much everything with our left hand and i was having an off day and couldn't throw, but i could catch. Kate was getting upset because i kept throwing it past her..sorry kate. hopefully tomorrow i'll have more energy knowing that my history test is done. Yesterday was funny when Kate, Sima, and i saw these guys after practice. Kate kept calling them fishies and calling them angry fishies when they wouldn't respond. then she started dancing behind my car..again wow. Sima and i couldn't stop laughing. Then as kate my mom talked forever we ended up throwing around the ball for a while and graham, alex, and tiffany came up for a little. The three guys i could see look over once and a while and i would just think of kate dancing and calling them fishies and monkies lol. And sima kept saying how gross they were because they were dipping and spitting it out. so wrong. Dipping is so gross and so pointless. Yep that was my past two days. Then i had Steve saying hi to me. that's enjoyable actually haha. I saw him twice today. And danny is funny about our ""prom date"", you're still picking me up at 7 danny haha. ok well I'm gonna go study for history so i'll update again probably in a week or so as i am so up on it lol. cya"

"event","Well I haven't updated in a while so I decided to. This morning was absolutely perfect. I put on my old pair of jeans with holes lol, a huge sweatshirt and i mean huge, and walked downstairs to let the dog out and it was cold and wet. Oh the loveliness. My favorite weather. Then I watched Pirates of the Carribean and Super Troopers, never gets old. I'm thinking about watching Harold and Kumar go to White Castle again even though i watched it on Friday with Kyle before going to the basketball game which wasn't as fun as the other ones. We sat on the other side which wasn't very enjoyable like other times. Next time i'm definitley sitting on the other side. After the game i called Kyle, knowing he was there but i wasn't sure where, to make sure he wasn't taking me home, and then i see a whole group turn around and point at me and there's my brother and all his friends directly across from me. I was like ok then and hung up. twas interesante. haha. What else to say, what else to say..School isn't that bad. My schedule is cool. Science Fair is finally over so maybe now i can go over to sams and just go ont he waverunner and hang out without having to do one bit of work. Of course that won't last long seeing how county is coming up. This year there's no way we'll win county I'm more than positive Neha(sorry if i spelled the name wrong) will be winning. That's all right. A lot of peopel won this year. In my category alone, sima and val, reed and david, and me and sam all at county in a row. That will be an experience to look forward too. Last year sam and i were bored sitting there with weird people across from a girl who was writing poetry and when i looked at it and it was all dark and gloomy, and she was a 6th grader, do the math. Except when that one kid was hitting on sam, he was such a nerd haha. I should probably do some homework since i have lacrosse tomorrow but I wont of course. I liked my dream last night. It was during the summer and my family and i were at our ""summer house"" over in Paris and it was like a huge mansion complete with maids and chefs. God i love dreams! The weird part was I guess everyone in 9th grade that goes to LHPS vacations at their homes in Paris. Haha, weird yes. Then I remember going to a lacrosse meeting at some museum with kate and going to the eiffle(spelled wrong i know) tower for science fair awards with Sam. Weird..but none the less enjoyable. Well anyway now that i've wasted your time by having you read something that has no point to it, i shall go. cya..please comment i like reading comments, even if there is nothing to comment about on this particular entry haha cya."

Anyway i made my mom watch cinderella story tonight and she liked it lol. Well after the movie I let Toby out and walked out front with him. I had on socks and a sweathirt and my jeans, but I was still cold. I looked at the dog still wandering around trying to ""pick a spot"" so to speak. Well since I was bored of sort of dancing around to stay warm i did the dumb little ""wish i may, wish i might, on the first star i see tonight.."" ordeal. I know, ""so 3rd grade"" but oh well. Anyway i made my wish and looked back up at the stars and took a breath, which was cool because i got to see my breath in the cold air (i love that about winter..easily amused i know). But then i saw a shooting star! it was awesome. you're probably reading this saying that i probably thought i did, but i really did. So i got to make another wish. After that experience of the night Toby was still wandering. My feet felt like icicles so i called him over telling him i'd give him a treat to go inside. He beat me to the door. No matter what that dog is doing, he'll forget all about it once the word ""treat"" is mentioned. haha. So yah then i came inside and now i'm writing this. pathetic really, but oh well. Tomorrow i get to go shopping, thank god. I need winter clothes. I'm down to one pair of jeans and maybe 3 shirts at most that are long sleeved that fit me. All my sweaters and sweatshirts work but the shirts, not so well. Well i'm gonna go watch tv and relax before going to sleep, pretty hard considering i woke up at 12 today. hope everyone had a great christmas cya"

"event","Tonight would be a wonderful night to stay up late and do nothing because exams are finally over, but because of me being dumb in math and needed as many extra points as i can possibly get to pull a B in that class, i have to wake up at 6 again as if it was any other friday morning to go take the ERB for the 4th time since it actually counted last year. I've memorized the answers i've taken that thing so much. oh well. Then hopefully I'm going with sammie to her sister's classroom for their end of the year party. haha and then i'm gonna come home and chill and then trying to go to the basketball game to hang out with everyone. I want to go to the movies after the game like around 7:30 or something so if anyone wants to go call me or comment or something because i wanna get out tomorrow night!! So today's exams were easy, as i thought they would be. Nice to be done. Today after i finished a quick thing with science fair with sam after my spanish exam i had another lunch outing with kyle and his friends. This time with kyle, radler, ali, and jared. luckily the conversations weren't as crazy as the last one thanks to ali being there haha. We went to moe's again for the second time this week. I saw a lot of people there like jacob, will, kaylen, ian..they were all there. But everyone kept getting mad at ali because she didn't want to drive to chipotle to meet up with some other people so yah. so then i came home and fell asleep. such an interesting day i know. I wish i could drive. Then like i could go out all the time and stuff, oh it would be so TIGHT (did you hear me daniel? TIGHT!). never will get old. i didnt see anybody today unless they were in my math and spanish class. After math we were all bored and i ended up drawing pictures with cameron, jacob, ryan, ricky, and courtney. Spanish we were all done with an hour to spare so we all just talked. Megan took all of courtland's stuff when he was making up part of the exam and gave me, morgan, and kelly some of it and he started freaking out about his bottle opener. Tim was nuts as usual. then courtland kept saying i was a bad girl for what i dont know. but when he was looking for his bottle opener by searching megan because will, loser, told him she had it. and he was reaching for her sweatshirt pocket and she was like stop i have feminine products in there and he backed away. it was the funniest thing. Then he was drawing on michael's back a lovely picture that kept me laughing the whole time. i would have laughed so hard if mrs. calvert had seen it. Courtland would have been so screwed. haha. ok well i'm gonna go to bed since it's another early morning tomorrow. cya"

"event","Well today was as good as it could be with two exams that just happened to be history and biology. Tomorrow, finally last day of exams, is gonna be pretty easy, math and spanish. Spanish i could walk in right now and ace it, but i'm just going to look over vocabulary and stuff. I studied for a while for math and i feel confident on what everything is. I know the review sheets inside out so hopefully that will be enough to do good on the exam. Yesterday i only had English, turns out i got a 105%, pretty good, considering there were 20 bonus points available haha. Then i couldn't stay after to do science fair, sorry sam. I ended up having to go out with kyle to lunch since mom was doing some tennis thingy, and kyle had to go to lunch with radler and leffler, so i had to go there while all i could think about was sam taking a spanish exam and then doing science fair. Which is sucky, i felt so bad because she was doing all that. But no one would get me there or pick me up. But lunch was interesting. Leffler is such a good driver..if you forget about him going off a turn and actually going up a tree because he was going so fast and didnt hit the brakes, then walked away without a scratch. Then had to pay 2000 dollars because it turned out to be an endangered tree haha smooth. They have interesting conversations, that i'm not going to talk about. But leffler said he felt bad that i had to sit there for an hour listening to him. All he could talk about was BTK..FBI.com is a great resource..hmm..Anyway all and all yesterday was good, until i got home and had to study, just to feel like i failed the exams today. God i wish exams were over!! Oh well. I ordered part of Kyle's christmas present today, thanks to kaitlin's brothers present to her..haha. Uhm i stil lhave to get the other part, and i have to get kyle to take me to the mall to get my mom's present. Then my mom is taking care of my dad's present since i have no idea what to get him. And i still have to figure out a good birthday present for kyle..i wanna spend a lot of money on him since it's his 18 birthday. hmm.. well i'm going to go study some more..one more day, just one more day and then i have like 2 weeks of nothing. how wonderful. just wondering, but is anyone gonna comment on my boring life haha, or should i jsut stop doing this dumb thing, it's pointless anyway..cya!"

"event","So today was fun. We had our last game of fall lacrosse. We played brantley's second varsity team which was made up of basically all juniors and some sophmores. They also went to states last year so they were extremely good. Well them vs. a team full of a mostly new players was funny and pointless. By half-time we were already at 11-0 and in the first ten minutes were at 6-0. Olivia did good in goal being as it was her second game ever in goal. She was awesome. Well by second half we put random people in for center, and people just played positions that they've never played before. We didn't see a point in trying. Since i was still playing attack and the ball was over by our goal instead of theirs, i resorted to dancing to keep me occupied. I was twirling and the other girl just laughed and complimented me on dancing since we were all bored. We also talked to them since there was nothing to do. The refs were getting upset for having to do the draw so much lol. I still had fun though. We all got hot chocolate after the game from Mrs. Dykes ""Pamela"". So then tonight i went to Kate's house to study history and biology. We got almost nothing done. Kate you have ADD. haha. ABZET: anatomy, botany, zoology, ecology, and taxonomy. and the for the Develop and Adjust, our boobs develop and we adjust to a new bra size. Wow that was funny. You got a kick out of that one, and then you had to show me the see through bra that you brought to Jul's and Daniel wanted you to put it on. How nice...not. So anyway after Kate's house my parents took a detour and decided to see the second house they stayed in after getting married before Kyle and I were born, and then showed me the house i lived in until i was 3. That was fun, i enjoyed remembering everything that happened there and all my old babysitters. I remember wanting to change my name to Christy because my favorite babysitter was named Christy. Then my mom told me a funny story of when the Dykes first moved to Florida and how Pamela was so upset their first christmas that she and Craigory went into their backyard and cut down a crappy tree. Then in the middle of the night they heard a big crack because the branches couldn't hold the ornaments. They fixed it with broken ornaments and the kids never noticed. haha. ok well i'm gonna go relax and go to sleep probably since i'll be studying tomorrow since i basically got nothing done today. night"

"event","Well i should probably be studying because kelly has been giving me a hard time about not studying for exams.  lol, you and you're binder, and now i have one!! haha. Well this week has been stressful with all the teachers piling stuff up on us because they want to fit in more material because we lost so much time thanks to hurricanes. And like the other morning i was up so late and i was so tired and i had to take the history test and i was like i'm screwed this day is gonna suck, but then we pulled out of the neighborhood, and there was a pretty bad accident. like a 17 year old guy was banged up in the front and back of his car. From what we could tell it looked like he was pulling out and a car must have been going around 60 hit him in the front, spun him around, and then hit him in the back. Luckily the kid was walking. That's when i realized that my day would never be as sucky as that kids. I felt bad. So the rest of this week i've been getting by pretty well because i've gotten over being stressed about exams. It's not worth it. If i just relax and focus i'll be better. So yah, that story also goes out to all the people who think their day is sucky or life sucks, because no matter how bad you have it, there's always someone who has it worse. So stop complaining and try to deal with it. I was complaining about all the work but once i stopped complaining it was easy. So stop with all the stuff saying ""my life sucks"" because i assure you, no matter how bad you might have it, someone has it way worse. Then in history on i think tuesday we practiced brad's pose for his permit picture lol. he tried to do a straight face and that didnt work. Everytime he would look at me we would both just start laughing. We spent most of the class just trying to get him to keep a straight face. I finally saw the actual permit today haha, good straight face brad. That was fun. Then the crew is done since mr. vallery said no more notes. i think caitlin and i are safe for a while..we'll see. So today Kate told me she was changing her name to caitlyn. Then on the way home i was thinking about my name and how many spellings there are. Carrie, Keri, Kerri, Cari, Cary, Kerry, Kerrie..the list just keeps going. i like Kerri the best. I like Kerry too because its the irish spelling lol. But i still think Kerri looks cool. haha i'm weird. But ironically i watched the x-zibit video and he was doing his song with a girl named Keri. that was ironic lol. i like that word. but i like goofy the most. And today patrick enjoyed telling radler that i thought his yearbook picture from last year made him look like a coon. Then he walked over to me and was acting all tough asking if i had. and i was just like yah, you have to admit you look like a coon! and he just shook his head holding in a smile and walked away. and zack wont let that picture in the sports illustrated or whatever it was. him and radler thought it looked like an older me for some reason. Then when i walked with kyle to get my lacrosse stick from his car after 8th period mckinney or however you spell his name was telling kyle he had to see the picture and i guess they were all talking about it. i still dont see the resemblence but they said that it looks exactly like me. luckily she was pretty and not some ugly woman trying to be young haha. 
So tomorrow morning i'm going to workouts with kate to see her mice, aka mrs. snyder's mice. I also will be doing my verbal stuff for spanish in the morning. At least i dont have to do it tonight. But i have to like go to sleep really early so i can get up tomorrow. Alright well i'm going to go study so i can tell kelly i'm a good student! haha. bye! oh and comment, i dont think anyone reads this anymore. haha dont worry, you dont ahve to my life isnt as exciting as some peoples..(alex..lol in ceramics, or maybe caitlin's life which always ends up going back to her pot!). ok cya!"

"event","Today was pretty good. Lacrosse game at 1. We were doing awesome at the beginning and were ahead like 5-0 in the first 15 minutes and i thought we would win would be cool because its fall ball and most the people on our team has never played. Then they started scoring. The refs were both pretty much new and didn't know how to call things so that was funny. Then when i had to bring the ball back in when it went out of bounds this girl cross checked me before i was even in bounds but we were still in play and her stick pushed me. and all the ref said was ""let her bring it in"" he didnt even call her it sucked. But hopefully we'll win our next game which is also the last game for fall. I want spring to start so all the players from last year will be back and we'll be really strong. Then after the game i came home and watched happy gilmore with kyle. After that we got our tree. it's smaller than last year which makes me cry..i love big trees. So then after dinner i did my history project. i only need two more sources thank god. I cant find anything else!! i keep going to the same sources and stuff. It sucks. Tomorrow i have a lot of homework to do again. I have to do that math review packet and english terms, but thanks to sammie the terms will be easy lol (david: why do you have sam's paper? Sam: she wasnt in class so she needs the notes. david: why weren't you in class? kerry: because i had other things to do?) lol. so then after my project i went and watched part of the snl re-runs with my mom. i was watching the one with donald trump hosting it. that was funny! and the regis and kelly show. That was funny. my house is freezing! i just turned the heater up. i'm soo cold. Ok well i'm gonna go cya"

That was really funny. We kept looking at all the ""hott guys"" haha. Except Kate seemed to think some guys were hott that no one could agree with lol. oh look its blake! haha. i'm not giving a last name to blake either it could many different blakes so dont get any ideas. but still funny. and then i felt bad for kelly like all day because of them having to put their dog down. Which sucks because he was so sweet. I'm sorry Kelly!! so luckily sam and i officially got started with science fair so we'll see how it ends up. Then tonight i spilled coke all over me and was so cold and had to go change my shirt and will seemed to get a kick out of that one and made fun of me. not cool will, not cool. and i'm a nice person and i'm not mean. lol. But anyway even after changing i'm still cold from the coke. ok well nothing else to really say so i'm out i'm tired so i'm gonna go study for my math quiz and then go to bed. cya"

"event","So today was pretty good. The morning was very good. Kyle and i had an interesting car ride to school this crazy lazy turned right in an intersection when we were going straight and she went to the left lane and not the right and caused everyone to slam on their brakes. but kyle is a good driver lol...jk kyle. Then walking over to school was wonderful..lol sammie..you know what i'm talking about..haha. Uhm then in biology i think sammie and my note from our parents and mrs. smith's email might have just saved us in science fair. we wont know until tomorrow but i'm praying that it will help or i will be so stressed out this week, even though i already am. This weekend is gonna be crazy! i have to do my history project, study guide for history, and maybe science fair but i'm hoping not. it depends on what happens tomorrow. and if i do have to do it this weekend its gonna suck because sam has to go see her grandparents and isnt allowed to stay home so i'll be doing all on my own. then when the judges ask us questions it will most likely be me answering and we all know how good that will go over in the end if sammie isnt there to fill in the blanks when i forget certain important details. Anyway so math sucked as usual. got confused and have to finish my portfolio project tonight that's due on thursday. Spanish was pretty easy. We just talked for the first 20 minutes about this project thing which i'm doing with Megan, Morgan, and of course Courtland is in my group. Wow. We're making him be the waiter lol. then we had a small conversation while Megan and i then tried picturing kailey's schoes in all white and a black stripe and how cute they would look. They looked comfortable. She said she got them on Ebay.. i never knew you get shoes on Ebay so that was interesting. Then history wasn't unbearable. Even though Brad wasn't too happy today and resorted to being a little mean today..jp brad. Then lunch. which was interesting afterwards because we walked by a group of some juniors and seniors and they were like ""It's Hyman's sister!!!"" and that was interesting lol. Sam just looked at me because she saw who was there..wow hes hott. So then ceramics comes. and people have been trying to make these whistle things called like ocarinas? i dont know how to spell it. but mr. reese said like 2 or 3 months ago that the first person to make it make a good sound and different notes gets an A for the semester no matter what. Well radler is on the edge of maybe getting a C because he doesnt do anything and today he made the ocarina thingy work. So now he gets an A for the semester. surprising how out of every person in the high school taking that class Radler of all people got it to work. Then he had no problems rubbing it in everyones face when they said something. he'd just be like ""Who made the ocarina work? who? who? that's right, not you"". So hmm. then after school we're in the parking lot and kyle asked if he had to take me to the vet. and Nichols just looked at him weird and kyle was like ""that's right, shes gotta get her shots."" so that was funny. So i dropped off the tubes for science fair even though ""Patty"" wasn't there but i left them with a note so hopefully that will get accomplished if you're reading this sam. and then we came home and now i'm writing this. So that was my day in full detail. Pretty boring to you i guess but i thought it was good. which was really nice on account of how sucky yesterday was. but now i have some homework to get done and i got on the computer to get my math assignment but ended up writing all of this. ok so i'm gonna go. and i'm proud, i'm actually updating! haha. Wow sam this morning was so great! i can't stop thinking about it and after lunch lol. ok ok i gotta go bye!"

"event","Well nothing has been happening. Yesterday i went to the mall with jen, no luck with jeans for either of us. Except that one pair at abercombie but we were too lazy to go back for them. it was funny when we decided it would be easier to walk around outside rather than inside..then we passed a group of like 20 guys who looked all punked out and a little goth. Then they kept looking at us..that was interesting..""just keep looking at eachother, dont look at them"" haha jen. Then the hollister guy, when we were trying on clothes! ""sometimes when i'm folding clothes i look at the manicon and i jump back scared."" haha. He was hott too... then the endless calling throught the afternoon. and the beau (boo) incident when you called him. 
Then i came home. Looked at what was on TV and ended up watching school of rock. Kevin Alexander Clark..wow..hott. Uhm, then i fell asleep. I woke up with 15 missed calls. Like 6 of them were from Jen. Sorry i messed up your plans last night. Sam and i had a funny chat..i'm thinking it might be steven sam. I'm not completely sure, it's either him, stevie, or jt from degrassi haha. hopefully its him because i dont think i'll be seeing stevie or jt anytime soon. So then I woke up today. Did absolutely nothing, but i did get most of that math thing done. ha ricky! i cought up to you. lol. I was gonna go to sammie's to help her take all her cousins out on the waverunners since we would be the only ones legally allowed to drive on the chain. Even though last time i went over i drove illegally because i didnt want to take the test. then a cop came by when we were in the cove and we both just jumped off and she climbed up. She was happy because i was ""scaring"" her too much jumping over the wakes and doing 360's. haha. good times. then kyle saw my live journal and now he says hes gonna read it and if he sees ""anything that ticks him off"" (which will probably be what i'm saying right now, i pre-aplogize kyle) hes gonna get mad at me. Hmm..I think i already screwed up. Oh well i usually do haha. Yah so basically everything i've said is a load of nothing. I'm sure you enjoyed it, but at least i'm updating. cya people"

I'm really gonna try to update more. I know, I know, i've been saying that a lot...and i haven't done too great at it. Ok well i got my new screen name, caliacoustic, adam helped with it. Today was thanksgiving, so i hope everyone had a cool day. Tomorrow is a big shopping day so i can't wait for that. Last night was funny. Mercado came over and was all tired and stuff and then my mom asked if his mom was all set for thanksgiving and making the turkey and his face lit up. It was soo funny. He was like, ""Yah, she's make a huge turkey it's gonna be so good!"". it was so funny. At dinner i had to sit through a huge debate about presidents, and i thought the election was over..i thought too soon I guess. Lacrosse has started and we're doing pretty good for most of the people being new. It's just dandy. haha cool word. I have nothing really entertaining to talk about tonight so i'll get back to ya. cya!"

My science test..hm..i did talk to her about how i could not tell from the pictures what the phases were and so did everyone else so tonight when she grades it hopefully she won't be too surprised on how bad we all did lol. Ceramics was interesting. Radler and Zach got to help Mr. Reese make the old dry clay into new clay. Alex and i took patrick's little face dude and made a jamacian guy haha. he's drying right now. Anyway after school i went to my brother's car as usual and he was there. So when steve saw me (in his boxers..changing from uniform into athletic shorts) and started to yell ""IT'S LITTLE HYMAN!!!"" that was an experience. So then after school i help kyle wash his car. That was another experience. He kept saying i was bad at it and kept spraying me with the hose. Then i was trying to rinse off one side of the car and the hose got caught up and knotted up and didn't let the water through. So i went to fix it and i had to put the nozel down, which had one of those things that you press the handle and it sprays. Well i kind of threw it down and it landed on the handle and just sprayed up into my face really hard. Kyle kept laughing and saying what the heck are you doing now?! So then i gave up with him and let him dry it himself lol. So we go inside end up watching fuse and the end of gothika because he fell asleep. So then later tonight at 6:30 he makes me get in his car and go with him to office max for index cards because ""he didnt want to go alone"" yah. That was my afternoon. I guess i might be updating more often so if ya wanna read a journal that doesn't have any drama or anything about crap going on in their life then read mine haha jp. alright cya i gotta figure out if kate and i are going to workouts in the morning since will at first said he didn't want me there and then said he wanted me to work out with them so...we'll see lol later"

But no one reads this anyway so it's not like i feel i have to so thats probably why theres no motivation for it. Anyway this week wasn't too bad. Luckily the weekend came. I spent last night hanging with my brother and his friends. Nothing too special. (sammie they couldnt come. i was hurt.) My parents went out of town on Thursday and come home tomorrow night. Andrew called me to go to the movies tonight but since he went out i didn't have a ride. And i had homework to do anyway so it's ok. I wonder if he found anyone else to go with. Hmm...well Sam, last night the dream continued. As usual. Umm you and Jordan weren't in it sorry. But an update real fast if any of you know what i'm talkinga bout. Sammie you're going out with Kris, Jen you're still with Slayter, and me and Ashton are still taking it slow. I seriously wanna meet this dude. lol. Yah. I'm trying to see if anything special happened this week..i can't think of any. I'm looking at the dice/cube thing i made in ceramics. That class is interesting. Mike barely speaks, Patrick is too good at it, Caitlin obsesses over her pot, which does look good, good luck with the cheesecake lol. Alex and Caitlin are funny when they go to get water though. Haha Alex, ok you can take your hand out now..haha. Then Radler and Zach do their Navaho dance and you can here them from inside while they're outside. it's hilarious. Patrick, your impression of Radler is so great. MR. REESE! haha. I saw Radler and Ali G last night. That was funny. Ali was so funny. Ashton was so funny in her security outfit haha. Umm so yah thats pretty much it. Nothing really happened this week. I'm gonna try to update once a week not once a month so yah. hopefully something interesting happens next week.Ok I'm out of things to talk about so cya

"event","Haha, well today was the retreat. Kate and i were extremely hyper int he morning part of it. the octopus...and i scared every person who had to talk to me during that one game. Then in the other game i never filled out one of those form thingies that the game was on. The one were everyone had to figure out who said what and put what for like favorite movie and stuff. people were answering and it turned out i wrote something down and i was chosen for it. hmm...dont remember doing that, and i learned something from it. i'm afraid of highschool because i dont want to lose my close friends because we're spread out. i mean does that even sound like something i would say? i think not. So anyway then we get like 30 minutes to just hang out and eat. Walked with sam and kate to go visit sam's brother who was in drama, mrs. candelora was teaching so we passed on that idea and we ran into adam. talked to him for a few minutes. Crazy adam...we actually talked and i didn't have to help you find me lol. so then he gave sam the greenday cd he made for her which she freaked about because it was red. SHIBBY SAM! lol. then we went bowling...hmm...i ended up bowling for sam and kelly and me. turns out i did better on sams and kelly's then i did on mine...ricky i wasnt slacking lol. and now luca beat me in bowling so i dont know what we bet on but im sure i owe him something. so then kate fell asleep on the way back to school so duffy and i ended up singing the Glen glen glen song making up a verse for everyone on the bus. the best one was moondoggys when he changed from a bus driver to a crossing guard. Wow that was funny. i dont think kate slept too well. And lance and jen were fighting cuz lance was being a loser and bowled for her. i dont know the details behind it all. so we get back to school did the tshirt design. they all sucked. no way school will let us do allie's idea. but i liked trevors. it should have a smiley on the front. and a smiley on the back with the eyes as x's and the tongue hanging out of the mouth and under it say  please dont kick me. lol good one trevor. even tho i changed his idea  tad bit there. so i get home did homework, it was interesting. ya so i finished came online. adam confused me again, and btw kate doesnt know what youre talking about. sam and i decided on dude wheres my car weekend. that should be extraordinary. my new word for this week. well i'm out my fingers hurt see ya!"

"event","Ok, well today was a lot better than yesterday. The person i was talking about before is getting better i guess, but it is still aggravating. Well afterschool i went to the student parking lot. Kyle told me to get in the backseat because radler was coming wtih us to go to sound advice. i said fine got in the back, let radler get the front, and then i reminded kyle about him having to take me to get my eyebrows done. That resulted in Radler talking about brazilian bikini waxes the entire way to the salon. They dropped me off and went to get milkshakes. I ended up having some of kyles and radlers, except radler got bananna, eeww. So after the eye brow waxing adventure we go to sound advice, figure out the wire kyle needed isnt there and so we go to best buy. On the short ride to best buy radler called the phone start to talk about this phone he was getting. Turned out they connected him to a sprint store in canada. He sat on hold for 15 minutes to get a call to canada. Then this girl was riding her bike so radler sticks his head out the window and says, ""whats up shorty?!"" well we were right by a car wash and this chinese dude who was drying a car looked at radler and shook his head. kyle couldnt stop laughing and told him to do his bird call. Radler did it and got everyones attention at the car wash. So kyle sped away. We get to best buy get the stuff we need and radler and i looked at the head units. He made the music soooo loud. Well after that we head over to the sprint store where radler gets quite upset about getting a false number from them that connected him to canada. Kyle and i evacuated and sat in the car. i listened to the songs on his mp3 player. twas fun. Then we get back to the school to drop off radler at his car. Then when we're going home radler calls up saying that he told his boss he wouldnt be working this weekend and wasnt sure when hed be back, because he wanted to party this weekend instead. Well the next line to kyle was that he thinks he just quit his job. hmm...smooth radler. 
So that was my joyous afternoon. I don't think anyone reads my lj anyway but oh well. The most exciting part of my day is after 8th period. But lets not forget 8th period. Mike and his ""sqaut bottle"" got caitlin and i really wet. We were holding up boards to block the water. Mr. reese just looked at us and shook his head. While this was going on radler was talking about mercado taking me to hc, uh ya right...lol. Which reminds me, today after school i had a joyous conversation with kyle and will. I'm not allowed to go to hc with any juniors or seniors and if its a 10th grader then they'll have to have a tiny chat with kyle, radler, and mercado. i didnt realize kyle was actually protective of me until then, because he said if mercado comes near me or any of his friends do, there will be SMAK going on. (smak means some major ass kicking btw). Then i asked will why he cared and he said hes the over protective friend. Which is all of kyles friends. They're all protective of me. hmm oh well. alright well im gonna go cya"

"event","Everything i thought i had sorted out has all gone wrong. Everything i thought i knew, i either forgot or it got so confusing i'm lost once again. School isn't getting better at all in the friends situation. I feel like some of my friends aren't really my friends. like they'll take any chance they can to stab me in the back then laugh about it. Maybe this isn't true, but what else can i believe. The one person i thought was one of my greatest friends put my name down and turned it in for something (not putting down specifics here) and now people stop me in the hall asking why i did it. It seems like just because she can't get something out of it and she thinks its all my fault, that she'll get back at me by going against me. Then that same person whenever i talk about something with this one person, she'll take his side. I know if it's because she likes him, but that's nice take his side for everything. I feel like there's only one friend that i can trust. And i know she knows who she is because she tells me things she doesnt tell anyone else and i keep them a secret. Why can't everyone just cut the crap and stop trying to get back at people. And with some of them i feel like i'm walking on sea shells hoping not to break them or make a mistake. I hate having people mad at me. i can't take it. I do anything i can to make them not hate me anymore. It's even worse when a good friend stabs you in the back. I feel like she's ditched me this entire year, granted we dont see each other much, but she'd rather hang out with other people than with me. At the football game, she chose to hang out with a certain 2 people and when i tried to talk to her, she turned away. I guess i'll just have to give up on making that friendship work cuz it hasn't been easy so far. I'm giving up on people in general. I can't put faith into anyone other than myself anymore. I guess i should just suck it up, forget everyone, forget everything going on around me, stop talking to people, and just concentrate on school. I kinda need to, some of my grades could really use some help....yaa....which reminds me i should go study vocab but not until i talk about after school which was hilarious. 
well i was thinking i was gonna stay after 8th period for 9th period and maybe meet with ms. knight for some help, but she had a meeting thing or a class or something like that so i ended up leaving. Well i walk to the senior lot and didnt see kyles car called him, and luckily he was walking over. his car was parked somewhere else because of off campus lunch. so then radler gets this fruit rollup out and starts throwing it at kyle and i in the car. Kyle, put my window down, and radler ended up hitting us and us throwing it back about 15 times. Then the back window was down and kyle was going forward and stopped short and radler ended up jumping through the window. i couldn't stop laughing. Then radler gets out another fruit roll up, but this time they put it on amanda's car. They wrote out the word dick with it on her front windsheild. Which after 10 minutes began melting. Well Amanda grabbed another fruit rollup out of radlers car and started putting it on the front of kyle's car. which it too began melting. Then she went around the car writing i love dicks into the dirt. hmm..... so she gets in kyles car, which is on, and kyle is sitting in radlers cars with her keys. Everyone decides to go to radlers house to wash the cars so no one goes home with dick written all over their car. Amanda wont get out of kyles car, and she didnt want to drive her car with dick writeen in fruit rollup on her windsheild, so i end up riding with her in kyles car. it was fun. We talked about how lhp is too strict, how the guys cant have their hair shaggy and how much that sucks, how hott lax players, how potheads are usually hott, and how her last boyfriend was a lax player and a pothead and how extremely hott he was. she'd be cool as an older sister lol. kyle drove amandas car, which is a small lexus and he looked so gay in it lol, its definitely a girls car. And radler didnt get any fruit rollup on his car so he drove his own car. We get there and i ended up driving radlers car a little bit while they washed the other two. i like his car. So then the cars are finished, and amanda made radler draw her a map on how to get out of the neighborhood. (he lives way in the back of wp and after winding roads). So she leaves and we all bet on how she'll get lost considering i helped her get to radlers house and how confused she was. So kyle and i came home finally then he left for baseball. 
yep that was my day....it was fun until after school. Thats definitely my favorite part cuz something crazy is always happening in that senior lot. Well i'm gonna go study vocab cya"

"event","ya...its been a while.....but i only think about doing this thing when im bored, tired, have nothing to do, did all my hw, and no one is really online. I'm extremely tired. i havent been totally awake all week. i'm like dead. i fell asleep in spanish once, and have almost fallen asleep all the other days.Well i just got done reading kates lj, and i realized that ive missed a lot. I seem to keep missing things. i don't see anyone anymore. I used to see my friends all the time, even if we didnt have classes together, i saw them at my locker or something. This year the lockers are split up, the lunches are split, and i have like no classes with my friends. It's screwed, i mean really. lol. don't get me wrong high school aint all that bad. Especially when kate and i came to the realization that we're ""open territory"" for the baseball players.....haha... anyways its screwed. But take jen for example, we never see each other. last year i saw her a lot, and we had like 1 or 2 classes together. Kate and i had no classes together but still, i saw her more than i saw anybody else. But now, i have zero classes with either of them, my locker is on the opposite side of campus then theirs, and its sucks. i'm not sure if any of you people who might actually read this agree with it being messed up, but oh well. 
    Well today was actually quite funny. I noticed that most people were in a bad mood today, and in spanish, i was basically asleep again. And after she asked everyone in the room questions she called on me to ask if she had asked me a question. i had no idea what she was talking about since i was like dead, so i just kind of nodded and shook my head a little bit. Then will decides to say, ""hey, kerry, speak up!"". Then senora just kind of looked at him then walked to the other board. In history caitlin, kelly, and i couldnt stop laughing cuz the sub was like us and asked the same questions, btw guys, we so killed the hedgimon joke lol. 
     Now i can't forget about lunch. Today i was rather lazy and tired. So i'm at my locker and everyone is waiting on me as usual, and i said i was too lazy to walk all the way to the cafeteria. So i decided to eat by the lockers, well on the bench by rachel's tree. So we're all stuck on this bench and we couldn't fit. It was soo funny. So we stand up because kelly needs to put her tray in the cafeteria and i said id walk with her and sammie, and sammie gets mad that id walk with them when i wouldnt go to the cafeteria earlier, so she kicked me! really really hard! lol. So then after that we go to the rex building and as we're leaving, kelly runs into the door, and i knocked into her. Sammie is laughing histerically btw. Then sam needs me to tie her shoes. Let it be known, she can't stand on one foot...haha. Wow that was crazy. 
     A quick recap of my after lunch experience. I ran into a total of 4 people in 10 minutes. On the way over i ran into this one kid (thats the 1st person). And then when i get up there, i'm laughing and start walking backwards when i trip over sonjas foot and hit her (person number 2) and then i keep tripping backwards to get my balance and trip over this kid kneeling at his bottom locker (thats the 3rd person) and then when im saying sorry and standing up and turning around, BAM! contact number 4 with another kid. So then after 8th period i go to my locker and end up running into it, and then i hit the wall when i was done at my locker. To say the least, i was having a rather off day today. 
     Then after school, i remember kyle had a meeting with his counsler and to take my time and i ran into sam. Well i realized before hand that i think i have been talking to the wrong person thinking it was someone else. she got a kick out of that one! So then i decide to head over to the car where the first thing i see are radler and nichols putting anything in the parking lot on my brothers car. Turns out kyle is still with the counsler so i end up hanging with them. Nichols car was on so i got in there when it got hot. i continued watching the two running in circles and running in and out of cars playing tag or something. i couldnt stop laughing. And nichols wigger music is blasting and then i turned it down. So kyle walks up and i come home. 
     Yah, that was my day. interesting i know. lol. It'll probably be awhile before i post again but uh oh well. never expect too much out of me. i mean come on, i was too lazy to walk to the cafeteria from my locker! haha. sorry about that guys, we wont do it again... haha. cya people!"

"event","People are crazy!!!! I'm serious! Everyone is mad at someone for some reason. Seriously, it disappoints me. There's too much he said she said crap going on too. Then people r just getting upset with no reason to support. Then there are people who are just making stuff up to get attention. Oh and let's not forget the many people who give a crap about what people think. Why can't everyone just forget about everything in the past, and things that have been said and just like i dont no start new and be happy? That would be cool! Everyone should just give up on being accepted and realize in 4 more years, you wont see these people again so what's the point in trying to get them to like you and accept you for only 4 years? Just be yourself and those who are your friends will like you for you and not like the person you're made up to be. I'm gonna use a vocab word and feel special...everyone has a gise or something. See i used gise, im a smart person. And people who put people down and make up stuff about people are just crappy. I mean c'mon! Do have so much time on your hands that you want to put people down?! Uh, focus on your own life, k? Then there are those who drag everything out of proportion. Or when you fight, and bring up stuff that happened in the past. I hate that! Or just those people who gossip, and spread rumors about people. I don't know about you, but i dont want those people as friends.. It's surprising how many people say they're your friend but really behind your back they treat you like crap. And people who talk about people behind their back? don't get me started! My new system is i dont get into discussions when they focus on one person and talk about them badly, i dont start a conversation about someone, and i dont tell secrets, and i dont say anything that someone could change around to make it go against me. Theres the people *unnamed* who won't let stuff go that was in the past and they wont forgive and forget. But to your face they tell you theyve forgotten about that crap, but behind your back they spread it around. Our world is made up of so many fake people. No one acts their real self. I dont get why. They act like someone else for people to like them. Don't they realize that means the people ur impressing don't like you, they like the person you made up. People feel that if for one second they let their true self out, they'll be shut down and no one will talk to them. Personally I only like to be friends with people who are crazy and dont care if people think they're weird. I mean take and Kate and I for example. Umm we fell down like 3 times a day every day last year and didnt care if we were weird. At lunch, we're the loudest lunch table, and we dont care. So to anybody who gives a crap about what people think of you, just screw it. Screw everything youve made up and just be yourself. Right now you're probalby like wow she's a loser or something but i dont care. And you might think this entry has no point and it's whack but the reason is because of so many people around me that i see everyday is obsessive over this crap. And people are fighting over this stuff. So just stop it already! I mean seriously! 

Ok well i feel better after saying all that. I don't know if you care about anything i said but i had to say it. And this doesn't go out to just some people, it goes out to everybody. Well later tonight i'll update again if i have something to say lol. cya!!"

"event","Hello friends! haha, i'm really hyper cuz natalie just left. Tonight was the season finale of summerland, and i just wonder, who with Ava pick?! My guess is Johnny...I mean duh! The other guy is crazy! Thinking of marraige after dating for a month...wow. Anyway, so Andrew got to enjoy a joyous conversation with me and Natalie and he said it was awkward since he didn't know her. Then we had a lovely chat about him wanting/not wanting to go out with me...long story don't ask. So then I taught Nat how to play rumikub with was just funny cuz she had all this stuff she could have done but didn't know. We went downstairs when her mom showed up and our moms ended up talking about hurricane damage, baseball camps, and Tyler's car accident. After that joyous conversation my dad came in asking who the escalade belonged to(he thought kyle's friends were over again since they like haven't left). Then we all went outside and the conversation of baseball started up again. To entertain ourselves Nat and i looked through the pictures on her phone and i saw the picture with the crazy couple with their arms flying up and down that aline and crack up about (happy dance aline!!). Then Nat brought up the time during baseball season and we were at her house and we really really really wanted chinese food from this place called ""China Fun"". Well she remembered that like a week ago or something she got chinese from ""China Fun"". We ended up imitating chinese saying ""China Fun"". We ended up recording it on her phone and listening to it over and over and over again. We were laughing and walking around the driveway in circles we were laughing so hard. haha! Then they left and I came upstairs. I'm sitting here now talking about my joyous night. I'm still hyper. And this journal reminds me, i still haven't gone on the waverunner. Oh, and Nat figured out that i could drive my waverunner to her house and pick her up. That's cool. Ok well I'm gonna go and reflect some more on my joyous times. At least something interesting happened tonight! Oh and my brother went up $10 in his poker game, so uh all is good! Chao!!"

"event","Ok well, I finally gifured this out. Thank you Kate!! lol. anyways today has been crazy. I went to bed around 4 last night because Reed and I were on the phone talking about like everything that came to mind. So i woke up at like 12 and walked to my brother's room to find out that it was just us 2 home and everyone else was at the condo. When i went downstairs teh doorbell rang and Kyle's friends were back. None of them have power so they're all over here and spending the night and eating all our food. So they came in and started another game of poker.  I almost bought into it, but i decided they would beat me and i would lose so i didnt. Then they kept telling me to fix them food and stuff. So then i came upstairs and talked to Kate on the phone. Then things got crazy and people were all mad at eachother (i'm just not gonna say anything about what exactly happened). So i'm still trying to figure that stuff out. Then I got bored and decided to make this thing. Kate had to get off the phone with me cuz she had people there. Now i'm on the phone with Andrew and he's talking, but i'm barely listening (sry andrew, I kinda know what you were talking about...something about ryan figuring out the lock??). Ya so I have an interesting life I know. lol. But I'm waitng to go out on the waverunner. But I probably won't be able to go on the waverunner cuz Kyle will end up making me pull him and his friends on the boat so they can wakeskate. So yah, there ya go. Yes Andrew I'm typing a lot. I know i have such an interesting life that all of you people who read this are intrigued by it. I don't know, maybe something will come up later on today that will be interesting. I'm just glad I figured out how this thing worked. I was so lost. What else is new? lol. Just to warn you I probably won't be updating this very often cuz I actually do have a life. And I don't even know why i started this cuz Andrew and i have talked about how we both hate live journals and don't see a point in having them since we're never going to update them, but somehow both of us have one. I don't know. ok well i'll update if i think about it or if i'm bored. cya"

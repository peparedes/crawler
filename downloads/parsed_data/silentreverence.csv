At some point in their lives, those two men put their life on the line, and the government doesn't even do so much as to keep them off the street. I'm not talking luxury hotel; I'm talking a military dorm (no different than while they served) with military meals until they got on their feet."

One of the other doormen/floor supervisors told Steve he can't work Monday night. Monday is St. Patrick's Day, you work at a bar, and you're telling your boss you can't work that night?!

So guess who's taking his shift? The guy who has only worked there a little over a week.

I won't be alone, though. Steve's not stupid--there will be 5 of us on. It's St Patty's Day in Boston, the day after Spring Break (the bar is on the BU campus), and the Dropkick Murphy's are playing right next door.

Should be a fun night."

I'll be turning another year older in a little less than a month and I know the burning question on everyone's mind is, ""What do I get Monty for his birthday?"" If you weren't going to get me a birthday present that's fine, I'm not fishing for them. But if you were, and don't already have some outrageously perfect gift for me, here are some suggestions.

<lj-cut text=""Threadless Tees"">
You've probably seen me wearing the shirt with a bird inside a rib cage; the stars with little wishes next to them; or everyone's favorite, the cookie saying, ""I love you,"" to the milk carton as they hold hands. You've probably thought, ""Those are amazingly cool shirts! I wonder where he got it; I want one of my own!"" Or maybe you thought, ""I want to get Monty another amazingly cool shirt like that!"" Here's your chance...

Use <b><a href=""http://www.threadless.com/?streetteam=memoriesxnvrxdie"">this link</a></b> and do one of two things:

1) Buy me a shirt
-or-
2) Buy yourself a shirt

-If you buy me a shirt: I get a shirt, and you get my undying love, and a super sweet present from me for your birthday (Julia, I still need your address to send yours, but its bigger and better to make up for being almost a year late).
-If you buy yourself a shirt: you get a shirt (and <i>some</i> undying love) and I get a $1.50 credit towards a shirt.

The shirts I would like (Men's XL):
<b>Bolds</b> are my favorites, and <strike>strikethroughs</strike> are out of stock, but you can help me out by requesting a reprint on that shirt's page.
<ul><li><strike>Advisors</strike>
<li>Bad Teddy
<li>Biblical Disaster
<li>Bleeding Heart
<li><strike>Bobshopping</strike>
<li>A Bubbly Beginning

<li><strike>Fish Tank</strike>
<li>Funkalicious

<li><strike>Good Intentions</strike>
<li><strike>Home is Where the Heart is</strike>
<li><strike>I Can't Draw</strike>
<li><strike>I Love Movies, Long Walks On the Beach, and...</strike>
<li>I Want To Be Friends
<li><b>Lil' Soap</b>
<li><strike>Meat is Murder</strike>
<li>Moon Kite
<li><strike>The Morning after</strike>
<li>Nerds Unite
<li><strike>Nothing Rhymes with Orange</strike>
<li><strike>Nuts!</strike>
<li>Paperboy

<li><strike>Technology Ruins Nature</strike>
<li>T-Shirt Plague
<li><strike>Wrath of the Sofa</strike>
<li><strike>You've Got Some 'Splaining To Do!</strike></ul>

Then leave a comment with which shirt you ordered (so other people don't get me the same shirt). I promise not to look at comments for this post until at least my birthday.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=B+H Photo Video gift card"">
Follow <b><a href=""http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home/;jsessionid=F1hcCGxGsd!737694576?O=mainbanner&A=getpage&Q=giftCard.jsp"">this link</a></b> and buy a gift card for the Mecca of photo geeks, B & H. Shipping is free, so I'll get every penny of how much you pay (unless you pay sales tax if you live in NY).

They'll send you a catalog once or twice a year because you ordered something, but you can just recycle it or donate it to my collection of fire-starters (sorry, donation not tax deductible).</lj-cut>

If you don't like the t-shirt or gift card options, you can always put together your own package and send it to me (for which you will also receive my undying love and an ultra sweet birthday gift). But whatever you do, leave a comment here so I know who to thank and who to give ultra sweet birthday presents.

My favorite part was probably when they stopped at the park in the ice cream truck and all the kids came running. Then the bear sticks his head out the window and scares all the kids away. I think the fact that you know what's coming made it funnier; kinda like in horror movies when you know something is about to happen, but not exactly when, and then when it happens, its 10 times scarier.

One scene stuck out in my mind. One part of a long scene actually. At one point of the fight between Borat and Azamat (both nude), Azamat is on top of Borat in more-or-less a 69 position. He sits up and yells in 'Kazakhi,' ""Eat my asshole!"" All I could think of for the next few minutes was ""Get a spoon, fucker.""
""Why?""
""So you can eat my ass.""

What coincidental timing.
<hr>
Tomorrow, I'm going to force myself to listen to Hear You Me again. Its been a while since I last tried, and maybe I'll be able to get through it. I doubt it though. I came across the lyrics in an away message and started to cry just from reading the words. Maybe its just bad timing."

"event","I just don't understand why someone from CT would want to go to UConn and see the same people they went to high school with for four more years. I know you love your friends to death, but branch out! As much as UConn has some really good programs, there are at least a dozen more schools with comparable programs out-of-state. There is so much more to the world than boozing every weekend with the same people you've been best friends with since kindergarten.

If you can go to a school where the vast majority of your classmates also attend, and can manage to make new friends and not seclude yourself to the same old circle, I applaud you. For those of you who haven't, I encourage you to do so. It changes your whole perspective on the world to meet people from other places and hear their view of the world.

I've spent this last semester at UConn, where nearly 200 people from my high school settled. I met a great friend in both of my classes whose life <a href=""http://silentreverence.livejournal.com/90212.html"">near-perfectly paralleled mine</a>, and our paths just crossed. I spent a semester with the brothers in APO. I knew only one (and by name only) from emails back and forth at the start of the semester, and now I have 50 more amazing friends.

It's not the fact that it's cheaper living here and taking classes at UConn, it's not being closer to family, it's not the better-paying job that's pulling on me when I decide to go back to BU. It's between these incredible people I feel I've only begun to know here, and the best friends I know I left back in Boston."

"event","I had my court appearance today for the <lj-cut text=""speeding ticket I received in September."">

I was running late for class on a Monday morning and was admittedly doing 70-75 on I384 in the left lane alongside a red Envoy in the center lane. Before going into a left curve, I checked my mirrors and noticed a large silver SUV approaching quickly in the center lane. When I exited the curve I was slightly ahead of the Envoy (front seats even with the Envoy's front bumper) because I had the inside lane. I checked my mirrors again and now the SUV was in the left lane and still fast-approaching. For 1/2 mile, the SUV was tailgating me at 5-10 ft. I decided to speed up in order to pass the Envoy and let this asshole go by me. As soon as I sped up, red and blue lights in the grill of the SUV started flashing. I slowed down and pulled over to the breakdown lane. The trooper told me he clocked me at 85 mph (mind you, I drive a 13 year old Taurus--I don't think it can even go 85). He handed me a ticket for T:14, C:248, S:14-219C ""Speeding"" for $294.
At this point, I would be 45 minutes late for my 50 minute lecture and decided to just go home. I looked up the statute--maximum penalty $150.</lj-cut>

When my name was called, I went to the prosecutor's desk and he asked me to verify name, DOB, blah blah blah, then said, ""You look familiar.""
""I do?""
""Yeah. You been here before?""
""No.""
""When was the last time you got a ticket in CT?""
""October 2005, for following too close. I came a round a sharp turn at night blinded by some truck lights and there was a stopped car.""
""Earth-shattering catastrophe?""
""No, just a fender bender.""
He cut me off sternly, ""Mmhmm, earth-shattering catastrophe.""
He opened my folder and read the ticket and officer's report.
""Speeding... What happened?""
I explained it to him pretty much as I did above, but he stopped me when I said the unbeknownst officer tailgated me.
""No, no. The officer wrote that he drove alongside you at the marked speed for 1/2 mile. He identified himself by motioning to his shoulder patch then signaled you to slow down as a good faith warning. Only after you acknowledged, then failed to comply, did he maneuver behind you and turn on his lights.""

Only a few slight physical impossibilities.
1) From the driver's seat of a Ford Taurus, the bottom of the driver's side window of a Ford Explorer (the unmarked vehicle the trooper was in) is roughly even with the top of a Taurus's passenger window. <i>There is no way in hell he could have signaled in a position I could see, never mind being able to see his shoulder patch, or him seeing my ""acknowledgment.""</i>
2) There was a red Envoy directly next to me the entire time. <i>I only accelerated to </i>pass<i> the Envoy. I would not accelerate to change lanes with no traffic. Fuck, I wouldn't have even changed lanes to let some asshole pass me, I would have just let him pass on the right (which is legal with 3 or more lanes).</i>

""He was behind me the entire time.""
""That's not what he has written.""
""He was never even with me at any time."" (Most of you reading this know my character and my history well enough to know that this is not the kind of thing I would ever consider lying about. I did, however, think about jamming my Eagle tie tac in his face and say, ""Look, fucker, I'm an Eagle. I pledged under my 'sacred honor' to 'exhibit all points of the scout law in all of my future endeavors. That includes being trustworthy. Now, do you trust the one who's trying to ensure a conviction on some random kid to fill his quota, or the one who is part of a group that less than .5% ever appear before a judge as defendant [Marion Barry, Arthur Gary Bishop, Russell Henderson, John Edward Robinson, Charles Whitman--whoops]?)
""He wrote that he was. I'm offering you $150 fine, or trial date in, probably, late February.""
""I wanted to ask about the ticket amount... I looked up the statute, and it said max fine is $150""
He responds with, ""You're the second person to say that today..."" and pulls out some chart and a ruler. He slides the ruler down to meet ""150"" and then shows me a line of fees and surcharges across the chart totaling $69, and a $75 STF charge--which he refused to explain to me--which added up to extra $144.

Wait, you're allowed to add charges that are not cited on the ticket, not connected within the text of the cited statute, and not presented in the CT State Driver's Manual? <b>What asshole allowed that?</b> Prof Besso (a CT Supreme Court Assist. Attorney Gen.) told us a few weeks ago of a case that got shot down because the charges weren't fully presented to the defendant (a teenage boy had gone to juvy for molesting his young sister; he got out and did it again, and the state was denied wiggling a stipulation mandating that the boy was not allowed to live with his sister when he was released again), so how is this legal?

I asked what would happen to my driving record, points added to my license, etc. for accepting the reduced fine. He pulled out the photocopy of the ticket, asked me to verify my sig on the back of the ticket under ""Not Guilty,"" then got snippy and said, ""If you had signed under Nolo Contendre (No Contest / Guilty) and just paid the fine, its guaranteed that no points would be added to your license.""
""I'm not concerned about it, I just wanted to know.""
""You'll have to call the DMV, I don't know. Are you going to take the $150?""
""Yeah.""
""Go out the back door, turn 90 degrees to you left and go the clerks' window. The file will be waiting when you get there. Now go.""

I think the THR based workout is kinda fucked up. It senses your HR drop below THR and increases resistance. But too much increase to resistance requires explosive muscle power instead of endurance strength.
Explosive power comes from TCP (sp?) stored in the muscle.
Endurance strength comes from O2 supplied by blood.

During use of TCP, the energy comes directly from what's stored in the cells without requiring oxygen, which would make your heart rate drop because your bloodstream is what delivers the O2. (O2 not needed + focused strength required elsewhere of the heart = drop in heart activity?)

I'm not sure if that's really correct, but I know that when it increased resistance, my HR dropped to about 140 bpm, and when I manually reduced the resistance (allowing me to ease the muscle tension and maintain a consistent, fast pace), I was able to kick my HR back up to where it needed to be (~170 bpm).

I'm only doing the THR programs for another couple weeks, or maybe less. Then I'm switching to one of the vari-programs.

Did I mention that if you take a hand off the pulse sensors for more than 5s, it resets it sensors to 90 bpm, and will only increase in reading by 5-7 bpm every couple seconds? That means, to build from 90 bpm to 170 bpm could take up to 20s, during which time, the prog has sensed your bpm below THR, and increased resistance. Add that to the hypothesis above and think how fucked up that becomes. Instead of using one of my 8 bajillion Nalgene bottles during workouts, I've rigged my CamelBak to the seat with the valve in my mouth so I don't have to take my hands off the sensors."

One of the most common finds of supernatural investigators is the ability of spirits to manipulate electricity, electronic devices, etc.

I've worn the silver guitar pick necklace from Drew's family everyday since the day I got it nearly a year and a half ago. Every time I see or hear a commuter line train in Boston, I pull it out from under my shirt, hold it in my hand and think/say a few words.

On the drive back from Boston on Sunday, there was a commuter train keeping pace on the line that runs along the Mass Pike (the line Drew and Molly had been walking on) for a few miles outside the city. As per usual, I held the pick in my hand, and kept holding it until the train was out of view (which was a solid minute or so because they run 60-70 mph, and <b>right</b> alongside the highway), the whole time thinking of Drew. The second the train left view and I put the necklace back down my shirt, the song playing from my Zen through my car stereo changed to Modern Myth--the song 30STM dedicated to Drew.

That would have to be some coincidence for one specific song to be the next in a random shuffle of 3200 songs. Seriously, what are the odds of that?
Mike? Greg? Got a figure for that?"

It was the first week of camp of next summer and I was sleeping in cabin 1, but the cabin wasn't the same. it was bigger in every direction, with a short wall in the center width-wise, beds arranged zig zag and against this wall. I was in a bed haed against this wall and directly across from the door. there was some skeevy old guy in the cabin as a camper in the back left corner, but I didn't really care that he was still a camper at 50. then I woke up in the middle of the night to see this guy carrying a 14 year old girl camper into the cabin and throw her down on his bed. I asked him what he was doing and he just looked at me and said ""statutory rape"" in a very declarative tone. So I called Ben over the walkie, and he and Dutton showed up. Dutton took the girl outside while Ben and I beat the shit out of the guy.

In love, you feel the most alive when your lover is creative and never lets you feel bored.

You'd like to your lover to think you are loyal and faithful... that you'll never change.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was ruthless, cold-blooded, and sarcastic.

Your ideal relationship is open. Both of you can talk about everything... no secrets.

Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about society and morality. You would never break a commitment.

You think of marriage something you've always wanted... though you haven't really thought about it.

In this moment, you think of love as something you thirst for. You'll do anything for love, but you won't fall for it easily.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/keystoyourheartquiz/"">What Are The Keys To Your Heart?</a></div>"

"event","A mother, expecting only an email from her son, was instead surprised by a knock on the door the morning of her birthday 3 years ago, tomorrow. But it wasn't her son there to surprise her with a hug, it was two uniformeds and a chaplain.
""Regardless of what anyone tells you, no one has to say a word when you open that door. You just know."" He was 21.

The parents of three soldiers stepped off their flight to Guam, where they were to meet their sons who had luckily gotten overlapping leave time. The parents found two of their sons, who immediately hugged their parents and delivered the news that the third had been killed that morning. He had been en route to the air base where he was to catch his flight out when his envoy was ambushed. He was 29.

A mother went to get her mail from the mailbox a week after her son was killed and two weeks after Mother's Day. She found a Mother's Day card from her now deceased son, and without opening it, collapsed and began to cry on the side of the road. He was 23 and married.

""All I could think was, 'At least she gets to come home. I can see her one more time.' Then the Army told me that would be impossible; it would have to be closed casket. I never got to say goodbye to her."" She was 19.

""Our little boy looked up at the man in the uniform on our porch and thought it meant his daddy was coming home. I had to tell him, 'Jesus took him home.'"" He was 34, married, a father of one, and expecting another.


Average age of an American soldier KIA in the War On Terror: 22 years, 5 months.
George comes home tomorrow."

The Youth Board of my family's church sent me a sympathy card after <a href=""http://silentreverence.livejournal.com/6271.html"">Adam</a>'s suicide. But it wasn't the thoughts of Adam that made me start to cry, it was the realization that the note inside was written by <a href=""http://silentreverence.livejournal.com/92375.html"">Macy</a>."

"event","Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Ken Mehlman, speaking about energy on this morning's Today Show:
""The democrats are obviously opponents of new energy. They have consistently voted against new energy--looking for new energy, transporting new energy, and drilling for new energy.""

Right. <i>We need destroy an Alaskan National Wildlife preserve so we can drill to get enough <b>water</b> to run hydro-electric dams. Hydrogen-run fuels cells? Where do those Democrats expect we are going to get the <b>most abundant element on earth</b>?! And Air? You want us to find <b>air</b> for those ""wind-mills"" you want to put up?! Preposterous! Nevermind the dangers posed to the environment if an accident should happen transporting water, hydrogen, or air!</i>

Republicans support new energy, my ass. Unless, of course, oil is a ""new energy.""
<b>Way to make yourself and your party look like idiots on the most-watched morning news show, Mr. Chairman.</b>"

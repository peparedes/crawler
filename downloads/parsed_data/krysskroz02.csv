"event","<FONT color=#6633ff>Well So far this week has been really weird for me. Like on Monday I was just so out of it. I couldnt consentrate on anything. I had to performe for piano and i couldnt do it because my mind kept going blank and not being able to see staight. I would have to shake my head and adjust my eyes. I would just blank out and wouldnt be thinking of anything and i would just sit there and stare of into nothing land. Today that has been happening to and also my body was feeling weird. Like i couldnt move it and it was heavy and i was very lightheaded. I dont know i just kind of felt like i am floating and just wanted to drift off, but i cant. So i sort of sway and look funny. I cant understand people conversations i get sidetracked. I laugh when other people are laughin even if i dont know what it is about. Just to make it seem like i am still there with you guys, but im not. Im somewhere else that i dont even know. In my mind, im thinking to much. I need to stop. The only thing i can concentrate on his listening to music. All the beautiful music i listening to it can hear it perfectly and conentrate on it, but with other things its just like nope bye. So i couldnt understand anything i was doing in Chem Com or Math because i would dose off. I dont know hopefully tomorrow i wont be like that. I guess there is only certain things i can focus on right now. Hmmm... o well It will go away hopefully. </FONT>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#003333>Hi! Well then lets talk about my weekend. I went to my dads....and unfortunatly...Leeann came with. No Just kidding. But she did come with. *ahem* Anyways. So I went to my dads and on Friday....we came home and played some DDR.Cant remember anything else. Saturday...Went and saw Cheaper by the Dozen. it was good. I think even better than the first.&nbsp;Well first we went to the mall. Now that was an experience. We walked around and&nbsp;got stared at alot...or maybe i did i dont know but my dad said it was&nbsp;probally because i looked like a hippie i guess. Anywas then we went to the food court and leeann checked&nbsp;out hott guys. Then there were these one hott guys i guess that were walking by Arby's then leeann and the guy stared at eachother and he walked in with his friend and sat right next to us. Then leeann decided we should leave. So we did. Then we stalked some other&nbsp;hott guys and took that photobooth picture of us. Then i accidently made fun of mexicans when they were right in front of us. I didnt even know...It was a couple. I started randomly humming the mexican hat dance and leeann would finish it. Then the lady in front of us glared back at us and then the guy did.&nbsp;I was confused then leeann was like""Uh...Krystyn...They are Mexican."" And we started laughing and ran away.&nbsp;hehe...opps. Then we went home.&nbsp;I think that is the importance of the day. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6600>Then Sunday my dad had his little football gang thingy. And me and Leeann went and saw Tristan and Isolde. It was sad and i was upset...it touched me. Then today we went to Woodfield mall and had Red Robins. I was very mad at them they didnt have my cream of potatoe soup and they didnt even have any side cheese. They are just horrible. I am very mad at them. Then we went and walked around and i got mistakened for a person who works at H&amp;M for grabbing a top hat. I knew i should told that person the worng place to go. But yea then we sat at Victoria Secret and watched this hot women model thing. They were so Pretty I am very Envious. Then we took pictures of us in there and then we got ColdStones. Oh we also got confued in this one store like Hollister. It was confusing and i didnt like it. So i walked around and then left.Also there was this bad smell there when we walked by a store and i guess this guy was like ""It's Antrax."" Haha. We also went in another store because they had a Sign Advertising Tristan &amp; Isolde. Then we just walked around and then we went home. And yea that was it really of are weekend. It was great. Yay!! Well i am done now byebye!!!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#6633ff>*The waves were crashing into eachother rawring like a pack of Lions. The boat was being thrashed back and forth uncontrablly. It was too dark to see anything in the distant. The only thing you could possibly see was the water infront of you which was lite by the light of the moon. Thunder rawred in the sky showing gods anger towards everyone. The lighting flashed making more light to see infront of me. Still nothing. I tried to control the boat and steer it into a different direction. Nothing was working. In a little boat like mine what was&nbsp;I suppose to do. Nothing. So i excepted what most likely going to happen. The boat was going to either crash into rocks and break, or it was going to be filled with too much water and sink. Either way i was going to end up into the water and eventually drown. So i slowly let go of the wheel and slowly walked backwards. I stared into the starry night closing my eyes. Feeling every raindrop caress my face as i slowly sat down. I opened my eyes back up and took one more glance at the moon and stars. My one last final glance of life. So i took in what i could before a giant wave came in and crashed down into my boat.&nbsp;I felt the hard water being thrown into my face. Pushing me down and off of the boat into the water. I put my hand out as if to grab onto something, but nothing was there. I looked up from under the water seeing the boat come crashing down right into my body. I got thrown down farther into the ocean feeling every inch of pain from the boat and water.The only thing i remember is a bright light being shined above before i completly blacked out.*</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Hmmm i dont feel like continuing.....maybe i will later....Who knows. Even though i know what i want to happen next. Thats ok though. So yea....this weel is finals. And Tuesday i got to sleep in and only had one final! Yay!! That was nice, but today i had Chem Com. And Health. Chem. Com was long...and health was short but bleh. Then we had a little party thingy afterwards in health. And the food were all discusting so i didnt eat anything, but michelle did and she said it was gross and she started to feel sick. HAHA. So yea then we went to Culvers and had food and icecream like always. Then went to leeanns and then to Patricks. Sat there and talked then Jade came over...and then Leeann,Jade, and I all left and went back to Leeann's. We sat there for alittle bit and then Troy randomly came over. Then we walked to chads and stalked him. Then he came out and attacked troy with those gun thingies that hurt. So Me and Jade and Leeann all ran away back home. Then troy came back. Then i told leeann to make me sexy and she started to make me look like a freak....well she still kind of had me still like a freak...but i guess it was a little better than before lol. But yea then we all stat here and took pictures the whole time and it was fun. So i have lovely new pictures on myspace...and yea. But yea This friday i am hoping to See Tristan and Isolde!!! Hopefully if we go early enough...man i am going to love this movie. I hope. But yea then i go to my dads and i think Leeann is comming to maybe....Hopefully. And yea then I dont know i will talk about my weekend when it is over with yay!!!!! Well good bye Loves!!!</FONT></P>

Actually i dont even know why i said that...hehe? Anyways...Umm I havnt updated in awhile...and katy and jade have been doing it and are probally tired of reading either there own....or eachothers. So i decided to be nice and update for them...even though there isnt really anything to updat about. Sorry...i dont have a story...not in the mood and cant just think of one..Im not always creative it is very rare when i am...and it is very rare when i am on my other side of my personality. SOME people would know what that personality is and THEY know who they are.And For some reason...i cant seem to stay like that either...i am confusing, I know.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff>Well my Winter Break was normal. It wasnt to exciting. Well some of it was,I guess. Um I went to Indiana For some of the time...that was normally boring. I went and Saw King Kong Twice. I also Saw Fun With Dick And Jane.I think that was all the movies. I didnt really hang out with anyone that much this break. I dont know why....i think....No i dont know. So it felt real weird when i got back to school...like it was summer. I dont like it. I dont like Illinois. I want to leave. I want to go to a Boarding School. I am looking them up right now. I want to go to England....and nice boarding school in England. I want to get away. I need new things...i am tired of this old crap and the same ole illinois. It can go die. I also want to travel the world. This is a time where i wish i was rich. But no...We are not. And i am talking about incredually rich...like i was watching the ""It"" Girls...the famous movie stars and seeing all there Humongous houses. It was like woah. But yea these are time where i was rich like that. I am not taking that design class i am going to take piano...because i want to learn. I also might not be in second hour Chem. Com anymore. Who knows...I dont have to take gym though that is good. Eh who cares i hate school. Seriously. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>I think i have finnaly learned to concur my fear of public Speaking. I mean i will still always be nervous...but i can do it alot better now. Like i know i have always been good at speaking loud and pronouncing and crap, but i just freak my self out. Just like with pills...hehe...ill hopefully get over that. I am sick...i dont feel good. I have a sore throat and a stuffy nose...and a weird voice. But i always love having colds because of my weird voice. I like it. :) I am eating Beef Stew now. It is hott....i havnt tried it yet...if it isnt good i am going to eat sloppy Joes. Umm I am going to Move To London when i am older. I am going to go to a college there. I dont care what you people say and how you question me about what is so great there. Who Cares....If i think i will like it and if i want to go there leave it at that and shut the hell up. Cause you know some people just need to learn to shut the hell up. Its annoying. Um....I think i am done now finally. So yay i updated....and uh....yea byebye!!!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff0000>One time I was walking down the city street.I was just walking until I saw a pretty <FONT color=#00cccc>Blue Balloon.</FONT> Right when I saw that balloon I knew I had to have it. So I ran after it. It kept going higher and higer. So I would climb building stairs to try and get it. But I never did get the balloon it was gone before I could catch it. So I slowly climbed back down the stairs very upset that I couldnt get my balloon. So there I was just walking in the cold, cold night with my hands in the pockets of my coat. Very upset and not noticing my surroundings, when someone ran into me. Making me fall onto the ground. I sat there for a second till I saw someones hand come out and reach for mine. I slowly looked up to see a rather tall man.""I'm sorry. I didnt see you there."" The man said. I slowly took his hand as he helped me up.""Its ok."" I said staring at him. He was a very handsome man indeed. His deep ocean blue eyes and his brown hair that looked like he just got out of bed. ""I'm Luke."" he said shaking my hand. ""Krystyn."" I said shaking his hand in return.""I'm really sorry about running into you,but i got to go."" he said as he started to walk away. ""Oh wait."" He said when he turned back around and walked to me again. He then handed me a <FONT color=#33ccff>blue balloon</FONT>. I took the <FONT color=#33ccff>blue balloon</FONT> and smiled up at him. ""I saw you chasing after it awhile ago and i got you another one."" he said smiling. ""Thanks."" I said as i started to walk away. I came up to this little coffee house and walked in. I orderd my coffe and bagle and walked to a little chair and sat down. I picked up a book and started to read and enjoy the peace of the coffee house. A few hours passed and someone else walked in.I slowly looked up from my book to see the same man that had run into me. I followed him with my eyes as he walked to the counter. He ordered his food and when he was done he slowly turned around examining the coffee house. He noticed me sitting in my chair staring at him. He smiled a little before i quickly went back down to my book. I looked up one more time to see a smiling luke sitting next to me. ""Small world eh?""he said to me. I smiled and nodded to him. ""Yup."" I said.We started to talk to eachother more and more. Finalyl a few more hours had passed and the store was closing. We exchaned number and went to our homes. That same night he called me and asked me out on another ""Outing."" Ever since then we had been talking and getting to know eachother more and more. Growing to like eachother every minute we were with eachother. Finally a year had passed and we started dating. It has been three years now of us dating and every moment of it has been great. I will never forget the first time we met. When he gave me my <FONT color=#33ccff>Blue Balloon</FONT>, I knew it was love at first sight.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#993399>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lol i am uber cool!!

"event","<P>Hello...Well Lets see...I went to my fathers house this weekend we didnt really do anything. We Went out to eat and watched a movie. We Watched Envy and The interprator. Envy was ok and The Interpretor was really good. I drove my dads new car as well that was fun it felt nice also. Ummm before i went to my dads i hung out with leeann and jade for awhile. I got to see Leeanns brother again. I had not seen him in a long long time it was getting lonely without him there lol. But his hair looked nice he should keep it like that forever. He actually looked like a normal teenage and made my thought of him being gay go away. hehe that rymes. Anyways yes they went to a movie...i wanted to go but i had to go to my dads. O well...I dont have to go to his house for like 3 weeks now because this week he is going on his anniversary little boat ride thing to Mexico With Lisa. And the next weekend I dont know we are just not going i guess. I am excited though this week we only have two days of school!! Score!! It will be nice...and we probally wont do alot either which is nice. I can wait for thanksgiving though just because i want to eat. To think of all the food that i get to eat yumm!!

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Hello!! Yes I am updating though i dont know really what to say....Ummm yea this week had been again like everyother week...the same and boring. Nothing has changed...nothing ever does. Well there was a fight in lunch yesturday yet again. It wasnt that big of a fight, but it was nice. Yea so there is really nothing on my mind. I think alot...But sometimes...i think i think to much. Its really nice though to think and to dream. Especially dream or even write.Because you can dream of you fantasy and write of what you want and about your feelings. I guess it is a way of expressing for me. Im not talking about poety either...i suck at that. So that answers Michelle's question from awhile back.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff6600>It was about how i...expressed my feelings or how i let them out. Something in that direction. I also love reading stories too. Because that as well brings you into your own fantasy world of what the writer is writing. It just maked me happy...because its a way to get away from the world. Which people need to do sometimes, or very often. I come to a conclusion of how i shouldnt really care anymore.Just go into my own fantasy, hide behind a book or something. Because that is where i really want to be. Not around people...they just bring you down more. No matter what, even the happiest person isnt happy. You see right through everyone...no one can hide anything. People should examine people more often. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff66>There are very few happy people in there world. Some of the sad people or upset and angry people..it might just be a little thing that is bugging them and nothing really big. But it doesnt matter, if they are upset or sad then they are. And people shouldnt compare it to worst things. Because no matter what something extremly bad has happend to someone. Im not saying now when i say i want to just hide behing a book or something and not be around people..it doesnt all of a sudden mean that i want everyone to stay away from me now.But really i dont know how else to express myself in ways with out actually fully comming out. Which is something i dont want to do. So dont even bother asking seriously. I shut people out anyways. Yes it is a bad thing,but it is the best thing for me. I've realized that. When it comes to problems with me or if i am upset I dont tell people. I hide it...and when they ask its nothing. Its because i dont want people to know or to talk about it. I hate talking about my feelings...feelings suck. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>They ruin everything unless you are happy. Personalities suck as well. No matter how hard you try to someone or everyone you are never the person they want you to be. Even though you should never be someone your not just for someone else. Then how else are you excepted. Your not. Thats why no one is who they really are...unless i guess you are with your friends,but even then your not. Its just not physically possible. Thats why some people are always they center of attention. Becuase they need it in order to go through life. If they dont get the attention they want then they dont know what to do with themselves. Thats why also other people dont like the attention either so they are the loner ones. But i think with the loners...is that they have tried to be the center of attention but it just didnt work for them. They have tried to get that attention.but it just didnt work. Either people just didnt listen or didnt care. So they gave up and now are seen as depressing loners when no one really understands at all. Also everyone has that someone. I mean as a friend not love. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>That one friend that they really get along with. The one that they usually always hanfg out with. Even if they dont notice it or try not to exclude other people.( I am not saying this directly to anyone so shut up.) Then there is the wonderers. The one who move from friend to friend because they dont have that one. There <U>one</U> is someone who are just with at that moment and when they find someone else...they just go to them. So they are confused and just dont know who so they are use to so many people and sometimes forget about the later friends and people they knew. Then there are just the people who are quite. The ones who dont really have one but have different ones kind of as well. But they really dont talk to them so that is why they dont have a one. They are to quite and just dont know what to say or do. No matter how close they are to that person. its almost as if they havnt known that person even if they had known them for like there whole life.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>There is just times in life when you know a person really well and you click and everything is good.Then there is times where you switch to another person you click with and dont anymore with the other person. So it is true with when you make many new friend and are with many new people. And some people that just hasnt happened yet or is still waiting i dont know. We arent going to get into the ""Love"" situation because...there really isnt one i guess. You dream of the love you want, your all upset because you dont have it yet, but really you just have to wait and people dont want to wait. That is the love situation its dumb and people need to come to realize that. People need to com to realize alot of things , but will that happen no. Life is a mysterious to only be found out when you die. When you die is when your life and everymeaning comes to a conclusion and only then do you know what the true meaning is. So dont question it just yet. There is a meaning but we have not gone through everything to know yet. We are only in highschool and have so much more to come. Well i guess i am done now. I actually think i have ran out of things to ramble on about. So just wait till next time till i have something even better to talk about yay! The Excitment and Suspense!!</FONT></P>

"event","<P>Ello Loves...yes..i havnt actually updated..i guess just because i never know what to say exactly. I know what katy would say right now...your suppose to talk about your feelings and all that crap. What if i dont like putting my feelings out for the public...otherwise known as my friends...to read. ITs basically like telling them when i dont like to express my feelings in the first place. Even though it is always to type them out sometimes...with certain subjects...but yea instead of telling your friends face to face. Everytime i always update i always ramble on about sumthing like this. Because like i said i dont know what to say in my update. </P>
<P>Well this week has been rather interesting. My mother was gone like the whole week at school and we could never get in her room. That made us very angry. One time i just had to snap at one of the teacher people. I got written up but nothing happened. My mom didnt care either. I am just <STRONG>that</STRONG> cool. Well yea today we had relaxation in Health today. It was nice. I needed it. I also finished the Catcher in The Rye book. I though it was a rather nice peice of literature. The main character Holden, I think, resembled me. He just basically reminded me of me. My personality in a way. But yes...I didnt like the ending though. It just didnt seem right or like a good ending for the book. It kind of left it to seem that&nbsp; I dont know there would be like a sequal...in a way. </P>
<P>Ok moving along from the book. Its only been like idk a week and a couple of days...and i cant even take that. The thought. Just me visioning it. Me lying to myself...to other people. Me not being able to do anything about it. But having to sit hear and know and listen about it. Hoping for the worst but yet the best. Me wishing i wasnt so dumb. Just wishing things would always go the way you want them to. The way you planned it. Or even knowing what will happen in the furture so you dont have to worry. You always still have to wait no matter what, unless you finally come out and stop being a big dumb butt. I dont know, but i am letting this go. </P>
<P>Because im not selfish. And ive had my share plenty of times and lost. So of course im not going to say anything im not that dumb. I think? Well i dont know i cant put this in anymore words with out actually saying the topic. Which i am sure half the effing people know already. Damn them all if they do. Well yes i am quite tired. Me and Jade are dying on the computer. She isnt over i am talking to hero n the computer. But we both want to leave so i am done now. I have said what i have came here to say. </P>
<P>So Farewell Loves!!!</P>

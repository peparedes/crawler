"event","Well now, I've begin my Wilderness EMT training here in Conway, New Hampshire. The library is closing soon and this keyboard is rather noisy, so I'm going to have to be brief.

By the way, when I sat down at this computer, the woman next to me looked up at me with kind of an inquisitive, maybe slightly accusatory glare. I recognized her as someone from my class who I'd heard say was coming down here, so I replied with a quiet (library-tone) but sort of conspiratorial ""Hello. I've been following you."" When I sat down and looked around a bit however, I realized that the woman I thought I had been talking to was in fact on the other end of the row of computers, and that the person who I had just claimed to be stalking was not in fact from my class at all. I'm not sure what to do about this -- she's still sitting there, in any case. I think if I tried to explain things I'd probably just unnerve her further.

Well, on to more pertinent matters.

SOLO is pretty awesome. The campus was built about thirty years ago, mostly out of big timber-frame buildings. The main building is a large hexagonal timber structure with three floors -- it's quite excellent. Everything has that very personal look that bespeaks construction which was done by skilled, creative indivuals who had a stake in what they were making. Almost nothing is locked, which is nice, but also the dorm rooms only have curtains rather than proper doors, which is a bit annoying. All in all, it's a good place with a good feel. Lots of trees and snow, though not as much snow as is usual for this time of year in New Hampshire.

My instructors' names are Bill, Trisha, and Jocelyn, and they're all pretty excellent. Bill in particular has been doing WEMT stuff since *well* before there was even such a thing as a WEMT, and has been teaching at SOLO for pretty much ever. He's incredibly interesting and enjoyable to listen to -- I actually find myself not wanting his lectures to end. ""Animated"" is probably an appropriate word. He's both extremely informative and very engaging and funny, using impressions, sarcasm, satire, deadpan, anecdote, and many other techniques with great skill and aplomb. One of his signiture moves seems to involve spinning a chair on one leg while lecturing, seemingly without paying any attention to the chair, and then just walking away from it and letting it crash to the ground as soon as he moves to a new point, without missing a single beat. Trisha and Jocelyn are much younger, and act more as assistant instructors, taking over specific parts of the training from time to time. They're both very very good, but Bill is really superb, well beyond my expectations.

So far we've covered basic initial-assessment type stuff, scene size-up and vital signs and physical examinations and the like, and also we've done CPR For The Healthcare Provider. By the way, for all of you out there who took CPR a few years ago: the AHA has changed the ratio of compressions to breaths to 30:2. Yes, for children and infants as well as adults. Apparently evidence has conclusively shown that we needed to be moving more blood and less air than we thought. If you've got two rescuers and you're working on a child or an infant, you can (should) change that to 15:2 however since you'll be able to get the breaths done with less interruption to the compressions if you have two rescuers working.

Food is abundant and delicious, cooked by Gila, our rock-and-roll chef here at SOLO. Leftovers are always made available in the fridge, and the dining hall is never closed (though the kitchen is locked up, off-hours). If I eat all I'm offered, I'm sure to gain weight. So, I won't be doing that. Also I hope this weekend to find a way to get out into the woods a bit and do some hiking. Class is very engaging and interesting, but not as physically intense as I had expected, at least not yet.

I have clinicals this weekend; a five-hour rotation at Conway Memorial Hospital. I also have another five-hour shift at an ambulence service next weekend. Very excited to see how those go.

Well, that was the five-minute warning from the friendly librarian. Time to be signing off. Hope anyone who's reading this is having as good a time as I am, and I'll write again next time I have something to write about.

Love and luck."

There's really no need to read this post. I wrote it while I was a bit depressed and crazy, and it was kind of a stupid thing to do -- pedantic, morally questionable, generally just a lot of rationalization. I'm a bit embarassed by it now. I could delete it of course, but I try to own my mistakes, so while I suppose it's maybe a bit melodramatic of me to leave this up, I feel like it's the thing to do. Just try to keep in mind that it's not really representative of my actual feelings or behavior... at least, I hope not.

Hey all. I started to respond to some of the comments in the last post about my pursuing employment with VIStech (a pornography wholesaler at which some of my friends work) and it kind of went on for quite a bit, so I've decided to make a post out of it. For what it's worth, the original comments (by Cat and my mother) took the position that working for VIStech would essentially be a vote in support for the sexual exploitation of women everywhere. I don't think I'm particularly exaggerating by saying that -- I'm not trying to start a flame war -- but by all means, correct me if neccessary. As you can see below, I'm willing to debate matters. What follows is the response I wrote up:

----

Hey, my first flame war! ;-)

By all means, elaborate your arguments. E-mail is fine if you don't want it in public, but I'm up for an open debate on the matter. It's not as if I don't have reservations myself, working for VIStech is something that I've been considering and reconsidering a fair bit. Anyone who has something to say on the matter is encouraged to contribute -- let's just try to keep this on a civil, rational level.

The pornography industry is definitely a fairly nasty business -- my main consideration has been whether or not it would be a net positive for society if it didn't exist. It's one of those situations where there's a demand that is going to be served whether or not the market is officially sanctioned, and therefore, as far as I can see, the best thing to do is to sanction the market and attempt to regulate it so as to avoid abuses.

As far as I can see (and feel free to debate the point with me) pornography (and sex work in general) is not *inherently* evil. It's only evil to the extent that it fosters sexual exploitation -- something which, in an ideal, enlightened system, need not be present. Of course, the society in which we live is far from ideal or universally enlightened, and a lot of exploitation undeniably occurs. This is unquestionably deplorable, but what is the best course of action to improve this situation?

I would argue that criminalization of the pornography industry would do more harm than good -- and in any case, it's not really a reasonable near-term goal. Improved regulation is certainly a good idea, but efforts are continually underway to this end, and due to their political nature, actual improvement tends to proceed at a glacial pace -- though I would opine that the last few decades have indeed seen steady, if very gradual, improvement in industry practices, and an overall reduction of the amount of exploitation occuring. These obvious options thus accounted for, there remains much room for improvement. What suggestions do you have?

I can potentially see room for a system of self-regulating producers and distributors of pornography, for instance a consortium of studios, distributors, and retailers that together agree to create, distribute, and sell only pornography that adheres to a code of ethical and procedural standards significantly higher than those imposed by law. I can even see a market for such a system. I can also see a use for an organization that tracks organizations involved in the porn business and rates them according to a universal standard, publishing its findings of the best (and worst) examples of non-exploitative pornography producers and merchants. Either of these options would be worthy causes, in my opinion. What other suggestions can you think of? I would love to hear them.

Getting back to the original matter though, there's the specific issue of to what extent a company like VIStech, a pornography wholesaler, contributes to sexual exploitation. VIStech, I think, is fairly amoral -- it conforms to industry regulations, but makes no attempt to go above and beyond in an effort to improve matters within its industry. For that matter, I'm fairly certain that the majority of the people working at VIStech don't really think very hard about the ethical considerations of their job -- whether or not they make a conscious effort to *avoid* thinking about such matters, I cannot say. However, since I *have* considered this issue, if I were to work for the company, it would essentially be an endorsement -- on a personal level -- that I am more or less satisfied with the state of affairs in the pornography industry.

To that end, I should try to objectively assess what that state of affairs is. Summarily, I would say that it's a situation of gross sexual exploitation. That's a conclusion that's pretty hard to avoid. However: the level of exploitation is significantly lower than it was in the past, and has been improving apace with general cultural attitudes toward sex -- that is to say, slowly but fairly steadily over the last few decades. Assuming that this trend continues toward what is eventually a reasonable facsimile of an idealized, exploitation-free sex industry (again, feel free to argue whether such a thing is even possible) does that then justify working for the industry while the current state of affairs still prevails? That's the question that I'm trying to answer. This is far as I go in this argument at the moment -- beyond here, I haven't made up my mind. Please, offer whatever insight you have.

Hopefully this has provided some food for thought for those who haven't given the issue much consideration, and clarified to those who do have opinions where I stand on the matter. It's not something that I take lightly, as you can see.

Please, please, let's discuss this! :-)

---

So there you have it. Weigh in, folks. I'm curious to get everyone's opinions and insight."

"event","Okay, yeah, it's been a while since I've updated here, hasn't it? Well, I'll try to fill you in on what's been happening lately.  I can't promise that I'll be terribly detailed, but if anything catches your fancy, feel free to ask for elaboration. Have I ever told you that I actually hate writing? It's the sad truth. There's just not very much that's particularly fun about it, actually I tend to find it quite boring because it always seems so long and drawn-out compared to the actual thoughts that I have to set down. If something takes me all of ten seconds to remember, it could easily take two hours to write out in full detail. Most annoying. Anyway, I'll try to hold my breath and run.

A couple of weekends ago, we went camping on the Yorke Peninsula. We'd been trying to go for a while, but we finally got everything together and did it. It was pretty spiff. The best part of it was the last night, where Matt and Chris and I ate some truly excellent, world-class kangaroo (prepared by Chris) and went walking along the beach with some French backpackers who we had met earlier while looking for someone to open our wine for us. Also earlier that day I went body surfing on an absolutely gorgeous beach, which we had all to ourselves, in waves that were almost twice as tall as I was. I got bashed about a little bit, but soon I learned that as soon as things started to go wrong, the best move was just to curl into a ball and cover my head. After that, everything was fine. Also there were kangaroos in our campsite, and around our campsite, and generally everywhere. I also saw probably about a dozen emus. All in all, the trip was pretty badass. I drank too much that last night though, and wasn't feeling so great on the drive back. I've been kinda taking it easy since then, regarding that sort of thing.

There's more to tell about the camping trip, but I can't be bothered. Ask me if you're curious, I'd love to talk about it, I just don't feel like journaling about it. Cool things happened.

Since then, I've just been kind of hanging around, eating good food, and going for walks and such. Matthew is working again, and he's enjoying his new contract. I'm trying to figure out what to do with myself. I can tell that I'm starting to stagnate a bit, the old patterns are kicking in, and I should do something about that. I need to shake the bug jar.

There's more that I'm forgetting, I'm sure. If it occurs to me, I'll post it. Peace."

"event","Hello. Quick update on the weekend. Matt and I made sort of a split-second decision last Thursday night to go out to the beach with our new swags and throw down for some camping and drinking 'round the fire. We walked down to the bus stop, where we witnessed a fight amongst some high-school bogans which resulted in a minor stabbing and the arrival of the police. We also got some free coffee from a church group that was doing a community outreach thing. Things went kind of downhill from there, though.

When we got into town, there was some confusion about the location of the bus stop where the bus to the beach was coming. We weren't overly worried though, as the online schedule that we had consulted indicated that the buses were running until about midnight on that route. It was not to be, however. We'd seen the wrong schedule, and were left waiting nearly an hour before determining (through consultation with another bus driver) that our route had stopped running about five minutes before we had gotten to the stop. Foiled!

So we decided then to head over to Big Chris's house for some drinks and such, since we'd heard that there were a few people over there. The bus we took had decals over its windows though, and we missed our stop by miles. We then had to take *another* bus to get closer to where we needed to be, and by the time we got in, everybody else was on their way out. We ended up just watching some movies, drinking the beer that we'd brought for the beach, and throwing our swags down out in the shed. The swags worked wonderfully, I'm happy to say, and I think that mine will be seeing a lot of use back in the States. It was hardly an uneventful night, but it wasn't really what we'd been aiming for. Morale, however, remained high throughout the proceedings.

It occurs to me that many of the folks reading this probably don't know what a swag is, since as far as I know they don't exist in North America. Swags seem to be pretty much an antipodean phenomenon. What they are is just an envelope of thick, waterproof canvas, with an integral mattress. Something like <a href=""http://www.jollyswags.swag.com.au/images/matilda.jpg"">this here</a>, for example. They can get <a href=""http://www.jollyswags.swag.com.au/images/bogong.jpg"">more elaborate</a> than that, but the first one is pretty much the one that I have. They're excellent in that one can pretty much just unroll them and be ready to sleep, and they're simple and durable and comfortable. When I get back I intend to take out the built-in mattress and replace it with an inflatable one, which should let it pack down smaller. They do tend to be a bit on the bulky side, by bacpacking standards, but they are hardly unmanageable, especailly when one considers that a swag roll neatly replaces the usual tent/sleeping bag/mattress combination.

Anyway, that's the most eventful thing that's happened to me in the last couple of days. Matt's out buying food for a barbeque right now, which should be good. Some people are coming over for food and drink. An interesting feature of Australian barbeques by the way, is that everyone who comes brings a share of the victuals. This seems to improve things from both social and gastronomical standpoints, while keeping expenses reasonable for all involved. I approve of this.

People seem to be home, so I'm gonna sign off. Talk to you all later."

"event","Hey everybody, wanted to let you know that the camping trip has been postponed until this coming Monday. The car that we're borrowing needs a new radiator thermostat, and we missed our window yesterday to get one. It's OK though, because this will give Big Chris (the owner of the car) some time to fix a couple of other more minor problems, and also by waiting until Monday we'll be able to go on a significantly longer trip. Matt has an interview for his next contract on Monday morning, so we have to be in town then, but his job won't actually start until a week after that, so this way we can camp from Monday to Sunday if we like, rather than from Wednesday/Thursday to Sunday. Neither of us are in much of a hurry right now, so it doesn't really matter when we leave. :-)

Anyway, just wanted to give an update about my slight change of plans. I'll try to keep you guys posted."

"event","OK, I'm gonna try to grind out an update here. Sorry about how sparse they've been since I've gotten to Adelaide.

Things here are definitely going well. Matt's a very chill guy, and we seem to get along pretty well together. He's had a lot of free time lately as he's between contracts at the moment (he actually got fired from his previous contract a day or two after I got into town, but his agency hooked him up with a better one shortly after, which should start up in a week or so) so he's had the time to show me around the area. We've been to the botanical gardens and a couple of beaches and hung out with his friends, just basic stuff. We've also watched quite a few good movies and TV shows in the evenings on his computer, and gone for lots of walks and talked about many things. Nothing terribly interesting to write about really, but it's been fun.

We're planning a camping trip to the Yorke Peninsula, probably leaving tonight. We've gone and bought a couple of swags (canvas bedrolls with built-in mattresses and waterproof coverings) and are just tying up the loose bits today before we head out for a few nights. It ought to be a good time, sitting on beaches and exploring forests and the like. The nights here have been gorgeous recently, perfectly balmy, and the days have been pleasantly warm and very sunny as well, so it should be a very pleasant time. We've borrowed a car from a friend of Matt's for the trip, so it should be a simple matter to just chuck everything in the back and head out. I'm planning a more extensive trip to Kangaroo Island as well, which will likely be a solo journey once Matt's new job has started up again. I'm excited to finally get a good look at the southern stars, since I've not really had the opportunity to see them well near the cities. The yorke peninsula is quite rural, so it should be quite impressive.

The beaches here are littered with cuttlefish bones (shells, technically) which is rather interesting. I've also seen hundreds of sea urchin shells, about the size of ping-pong balls. I should be able to get a better look at the water soon, as Matt and I have talked about doing some snorkeling while we're out on the peninsula. We've also discussed going wind-surfing, which should be pretty excellent. When we visited West Beach the other day, there were about a dozen kite surfers cruising around, which was pretty cool to see.

I've seen pelicans and lorikeets and other birds along those lines, which is pretty cool. With some luck I should have a chance of seeing some of the classic Australian megafauna while I'm out camping, by which I mean there are going to be kangaroos around. That should be pretty cool as well.

That's about it for the moment, as least as far as I can think of. I'll sign off for now, and try to give a prompt update when I get back from the camping trip. See you all then. ;-)"

"event","OK, I don't really feel like going over everything that's happened between Melbourne and now in great detail, so I'm just gonna hit the highlights.

One thing I forgot to mention about the concerts at The Corner Hotel was that the first one was probably one of the worst Dresden Dolls concerts ever. Amanda took exception to her piano (rumors abound as to why) and it threw off the whole show quite badly when she decided she wasn't going to play piano anymore. Since the Dolls consists of one (1) piano player/singer and one (1) drummer, you can imagine why this might have caused problems.

There was a third show in Melbourne, at a smallish pub called The Old Bar, where Jason had basically a solo show. There was an opening act, but they were pretty forgettable. Jason packed the place well over its normal capacity though, and had the chance to do a lot of songs that he hadn't been able to get to during his half-hour opening sets for the Dolls. I got to see most of the show, since he told me to just shut down the merch booth until the end of things. Jason has a great ghost story that he tells, which I might try to do my own version of sometime.

We went home after the concert and had artichokes, which Jason had bought on our first day. Apparently artichokes are something of special significance for him, and he credits himself with having slightly increased world artichoke consumption by introducing many people to the food. I'm quite familiar with them of course, and they were indeed suitably delicious. Jason sang a few songs on the guitar, and Angie did a couple of her own as well (I hadn't known that she was a songwriter as well) and eventually all of us went to bed feeling quite happy, though perhaps a bit chilly.

We got to Adelaide the next day, of course. I met Matt outside his work, grabbed some lunch with him, and then went off and explored the city a bit. Adelaide is a smallish city, but it has significance as the place where Jason and Amanda first met, six years ago. Some of the songs on Jason's album <i>Counterpoint</i> were written around Adelaide as well. Matt and I eventually met up after his work got out, and together with Jim (a friend of Matt's) we eventually went to the University Bar for the show. Jason was happy to put Matt and Jim on the door list, so they got in for free -- though a security guard did make them go outside and stand in line until doors opening. I also met a guy there named Gabe, who was providing accomodation for Jason while he was in town.

I thought the show went fairly well. The main thing that marred it was that The Red Paintings had had their van broken into the night before, and all of their equipment had been stolen. Guitars, amps, effects pedals, everything had been taken. Even the canvases of improvisational paintings that had been painted during the shows on the last two tours were stolen. Fucking horrible, if I do say so. It was a really terrible thing to happen to such nice people. They went on anyway with what they had -- including some borrowed instruments -- and put on a pretty intense show, though it was a real shame that they couldn't do some of the tricks that they usually do at their shows.

The crowd was a bit cold at the beginning, but they warmed up nicely once the Dolls came on. It was an all-ages show, and the Dolls attract a rather young crowd. There was some onstage sparring between Amanda and Brian however, as they couldn't seem to agree on what to play or when. They really weren't getting along, but the crowd seemed to enjoy things nonetheless. I hear that the Dolls might be splitting up, temporarily, after this tour. Jason mentioned something about a possible tour involving just him and Amanda, which would probably be pretty cool to see. We sold a fair deal of merch as well.

There was another show the next night at the Grace Emily, another Jason-only show. The Grace Emily has some significance as being the first place in Adelaide where Jason played, back when he was down here as a busker. Apparently he went in to watch a show, and then afterward went out to the Beer Garden and did his thing up on one of the tables out there. It must've been pretty memorable, as there were several people who had been there and came back to see him again (including the members of the band that had been playing that night). Jason and I went out and grabbed some Thai food beforehand and had some nice conversation about various matters. He gave me the night off for that show, so I hung out with Gabe and his friends and had some drinks and overall enjoyed the show immensely, probably moreso than any of the others that I'd been to. The crowd was very enthusiastic, and I had the opportunity to show my full enthusiasm as well. Afterwards the crowd disappeared immediately, which was a shame for the band that was coming on afterward, but honestly that band was nothing particularly special. We all hung around for a while, until I eventually got tired and Jason got me a cab back to Matt's place.

Thus ended the tour. I'll write more about the things that have happened here sometime later, this has gone on a bit longer than I intended. Be well, everyone."

"event","Sorry about the huge delay, all the backlog kinda makes me wary about sitting down to write. As usual, if I don't keep on top of my shit, it gets away from me. Had the last concert a couple nights ago. I'll get to it eventually. It was a good thing. Things are over now, that portion of the trip (and my life) is over. I kinda wish it weren't, this has been one crazy and ecstatic run, and I've had an excellent time. It's been quite the positive experience, I must say. I'm trying to keep things roughly chronological though, so I really ought to talk about Melbourne now. Ai yi, I've got a lot to write about. Oh well, one word at a time.

Melbourne was possibly the climax of the tour, for me. I'd gone from living in a hostel a half hour's walk out of town to living in a house with Jason and some fans of his. Quite a change, and more than I expected from this tour. Our primary benefactress was one Angie, whose house it partly was that Jason and I were sleeping in. Also of particular note was Eva, who had flown in from Tasmania for the shows! Both were wonderfully kind and generous, and it was an absolute pleasure living with them.

Jeez... so much to talk about. I'm gonna rush right through it and if you want more details you can ask me about it in a comment or something, OK?

There were three shows in Melbourne, two of which were at The Corner Hotel, which was a decent sort of club, although there wasn't really enough merch space and I couldn't see the shows very well. At the first show, Dallas bought me some nachos which never did arrive, so at the second show the bar comped her for food and drink and consequently I got to enjoy some cointreaux, which is usually rather too expensive for me to afford but which I love dearly. I was really starting to get comfortable by now, and everything so far as I can remember went swimmingly, albeit with the usual nearly-averted crises that are endemic to this sort of thing. The only problem was that the batch of CDs that Jason had ordered from the States didn't show up on time, so at the second show we didn't have any to sell, which was a bit disappointing. He ended up having to take a cab to the airport the next day in order to intercept them so that he could have any CDs at all for the rest of the tour, which was stressful for him but worked out in the end.

We had some nice sushi before the second show together, which was nice as it gave me the opportunity to just talk with him about stuff. Jason really is quite a guy, I'd like it if he could manage to come to my island someday. He says he'd like that too, so hopefully he'll be in Boston some Summer. A Jason Webley concert in Battery Burbeck-Morris would be one of the highlights of my life thus far.

Anyway, they were good concerts at The Corner Hotel."

"event","OK, I'm all the way down in Adelaide right now. I've got quite a lot to talk about, but I'll try to catch you all up. I probably won't get around to doing it all in this entry, but I'll see if I can pick up where I left off. I was in Sydney, right? Before the show. Right.

Oh, before I get going, everyone should know that I'm still well, that I've been feeling a bit sick and allergic but that I'm definitely getting over it, and that I've met up with Matthew in Adelaide and contrary to his general reputation he does seem to be a pretty decent sort of fellow. All in all, things are going well. Spectacularly well actually, but I'll get around to that eventually.

The Sydney show was great. I had a little difficulty getting to the venue as it was a bit of a ways out of town and I got off at the wrong stop, but some Dolls fans (who had also gotten off at the same wrong stop) and I eventually did walk there. I had Jason's merch box with me, since he didn't have space in his luggage for it, so I had to lug it a couple of kilometers to The Roundhouse, but it's all good. I had a little trouble locating a back entrance, but I ran into the merch guys for The Red Paintings (actually one merch girl and one merch guy) who also doubled as the managers for TRP's street crew when they weren't selling merch. Anyway, the venue was pretty great. It was a large round building clearly used for multiple University functions (it was at the University of New South Wales) with a balcony running around the top. It held about 2,000 people quite comfortably, and had the best merch arrangements to date. All in all I sold over $2,000 of merch at that show! Everything pretty much went great, the crowd really seemed to love it, and my working pass got me up to the part of the balcony where normal guests couldn't go, so I got to duck out at a couple of points and get a glorious view of the Dresden Dolls doing their thing. All in all it was a great venue and a great show.

After the show I had a drink with Jason and then got a ride home with Nigel (the Australian tour manager for the Dresden Dolls) but got lost anyway trying to get back to my hostel, so I just grabbed a cab even though it was only like two blocks. I figured better to pay $5 to get a ride with somebody who knows the way than to just aimlessly wander downtown Sydney at 2AM.

Don't remember very much of the flight to Melbourne. I remember getting up early and going to the airport. Had some difficulty in reaching Jason and the folks we were going to be staying with (Jason had arranged for me to stay with him at the house of some Melbournian fans of his) due to my not arriving at a convenient time, but we eventually managed to link up.

Gah, that's all I have the energy for right now. Sorry. I'll write more tomorrow. I plan to sit on my ass all day tomorrow and use Matt's computer. I need a break.

Talk to you later."

"event","Probably just a quick entry this time. I've arrived in Sydney, and just checked into the hostel. Things are fine of course. Don't really have any impressions of the city yet, and I probably won't get much of a chance to look around, as it's a biggish city and I only have one afternoon. Eating is high on my list of priorities, as is figuring out how to get to The Roundhouse, which is way over at the University of New South Wales and therefore will require a bus ride.

Today's flight was painless, just an hour long. They fed me lunch. I've bought Jason a new guestbook (a moleskine thing) since I feel responsible for letting his original one get stolen. The box of t-shirts made it through the flight just fine, no problems there. The only annoying thing about the flight was a couple of kids whose parents allowed them to run shrieking around the terminal, jumping over chairs, riding the conveyor belt, standing in front of me at the baggage claim, and touching everybody's bags as they went by. A little parental education would've been a good thing there, but the parents in question didn't seem to be willing to give any.

Life is pretty much OK in any case. This hostel seems nice enough, it's in a converted railway shipping facility, and hopefully the patrons here are more polite than those at The Palace. The Palace is a great building, a huge Victorian-era apartment building with an old-fashioned elevator and gorgeous wraparound balconies, but the Lonely Planet was right about it being a hostel for party animals. Party assholes might've been a better description, as people seemed to feel free to come into the room, turn on the lights, and hold loud conversations for many minutes as if there weren't two or three people trying to sleep. 

Recognizing of course that those who choose to attempt sleep outside of normal hours for such can expect a certain amount of disturbance, one would nonetheless think that other patrons would respect the fact that there are many places to have phone conversations but very few for sleeping. An eight-share dorm room is a far cry from private accomodation, and as far as I'm concerned they are to be used for two purposes only, namely a: sleeping and b: storing and accessing luggage. The first is primary, the second does inevitably create conflicts but people should be expected to take reasonable precautions to avoid disturbing sleepers, and to be as quiet as possible. There are *ample* common areas (in fact an entire city) available for doing everything other than those two very important things, so planning the day's activities with one's mates needn't be done in the dorm. Ignoring these facts and behaving as if one owned the entire room strikes me as rather rude, but it happened several times during my two-night stay.

Anyway, sorry for the rant. The other two hostels that I've stayed at have been very nice, and people have been very polite about preserving the dorm spaces as sanctuaries for those who need to use them for their intended purposes. The Rosemere in Wellington is my favorite so far, and I think that the fact that there are people who have been staying there for up to four years at a stretch (with no plans of leaving in the forseeable future) speaks to its quality. That I also felt quite welcome there immediately upon stepping past reception is remarkable, and if I'm ever in Wellington again I'll be sure to make use of its services once more. I regret that I don't have any photos of it, but honestly I've had more pressing things on my mind than trying to document everything I do. Once I'm in Adelaide I might find time to do some photography, but really I haven't been in the mood. Sorry, Mom.

This was supposed to be a short entry. I'll write more after the concert, probably. Until then."

"event","Well well, I feel *much* better now. Took me a while to get going to day but with medication and a generous amount of water, I'm now feeling well. Tonight's concert was excellent, more on that in a bit. I finally did meet Hebby today (after yesterday's mixup) and after having some lunch in the train station we went walking around and then eventually went up to his mate's flat where the three of us spent the next few hours 'til it was time to go to the concert. 'Twas a good time, his friend Marty is quite a nice guy, and Hebby himself is just as decent a sort in person as he is online, which was cool to find out, not that I much doubted he would be. We watched the pedestrian mall down below on Birmingham St. where people were setting up for a festival (and taking their own good time about it) which was supposed to start in early afternoon but which hadn't actually gotten underway yet by the time I had to leave for the show. I enjoyed the visit, in any case.

Tonight's concert was probably the best one yet. Sales were definitely a lot better than in the two New Zealand concerts, and while Jason said that he didn't really feel like he ""won"" the crowd as much as he'd have liked, he seemed in a better sort of mood afterward nonetheless. It probably helped that we managed to sell well over half of the merch that he brought to the show, which was more than usual in the first place. He's got me selling merch for pretty much the whole show now, rather than just during the times when he can't man the booth himself, and it's good to feel like I'm doing enough work to justify my free admittance. In fact, he said that now that he's doing better on the tour he wants to pay for some of my expenses, and while I'm a little reluctant to take advantage of the offer, I'm sure there will be times when I will benefit from his generosity. He wants to have some dinner with me in any case, which is sure to be a treat, and he says he has a place where I can stay in Melbourne, which should be cool, as well as relieving me of three nights' hostel bills. I think it's three nights. Anyway, things are going well.

I'm quite enjoying selling merchandise, as it helps me feel useful and allows me to maintain a little bit of personal space, so to speak. I think I'd rather see the concert from behind a merch desk than from the middle of a mosh pit, especially when the table is actually inside the club, as it was tonight. The only bad thing that happened was that somebody snatched Jason's guestbook while my back was turned, and he lost all of the e-mail addresses that he had collected over the course of the tour thus far. I need to keep more on top of that sort of thing. If possible I think I may tether the book to the desk on future concerts, so that it can't just be grabbed like that. I'm pretty sure I've got a couple of bootlaces in my pack that would serve the purpose. Sales went well though, I sold lots of discs and t-shirts. I'm carrying the remaining t-shirts for Jason on tomorrow's flight, since he's at his baggage limit and I'm well under mine.

Jason continues to be a great guy, his offstage personality is very unlike his onstage one, though the two seem to fit, rather oddly albeit. He's quite soft-spoken in person, rather the opposite of his extremely bombastic stage projection, and seems almost apologetic most of the time. He's very likable in any case, as both his stage persona and his offstage personality are marked by a sort of implicit honesty that's difficult to fake. Everyone on the tour seems very kind, though I hear that Amanda of the Dolls has a tendency to bite a bit harder than she needs to. I rarely have dealings with the Dolls though, I more often work with their hired help, who change from show to show and so far have been nice enough if not neccessarily particular fans of the music.

All in all, it was a great concert. It was nice to be in the show for once, and the location of the booth clearly had a lot to do with the sales. Ah, I forgot to mention that there was a performance by <a href=""http://www.zenzenzo.com/"">Zen Zen Zo</a> in between Jason and The Red Paintings. They were quite a lot better than the Wellington band that made up the third act at the concert the other night, but I didn't get to see them as much as I would've liked, my view of the stage being mostly obstructed. They  had a number of performers down on the dancefloor too, whom I couldn't see at all. What I could manage to see though was quite interesting.

I hope everyone is well out there, and that those of you who are reading this find it interesting. I'm really not sure how interesting it could possibly be, since it's mostly reports about how tired I am and how the concerts are going, but that's pretty much all that's on my mind these days. Anyway, Mom and Dad at least are probably happy to get regular news. ;-) I've got a flight to catch tomorrow, so I ought to be going. I should be able to get a nice eight hours of sleep tonight, though. See you all later on."

"event","Well, I got probably a good sixteen hours' sleep, but I'm still feeling pretty out of it. My throat feels a bit swollen and my head feels a bit too large, so I've probably come down with something. I guess that missing a night of sleep was probably the last straw, what with the strange environment, all the moving around, the packed clubs and the inevitably less-than-ideal hygienic situation of hostel living. I'll be fine, but I think it's a good idea that Dad bought me those antibiotics, because it looks like I'm going to be using them. I've been trying to get lots of fluids too, since I probably haven't been drinking enough these last few days and likely am more than a bit dehydrated.

So yesterday when I went down to Birmingham Street to meet with my friend, it was the wrong day, and so of course he wasn't there. It's sorted now, happily. I needed to go that way anyway because it's pretty much right next door to the club where the bands are playing tonight, so it's good that I had a trial run.

Not much else going on as of yet. I checked out the Museum of Brisbane (which is in City Hall) and honestly was not terribly impressed with any of the art they had on display. About half of it was apparently closed down due to a change of exhibitions though, which couldn'tve helped. It was free, in any case.

This is probably the first time in my life that I've really lived in the heart of a major city. The other hostels I was in were both on the edge of the center of town, so to speak, and I think I liked that a bit better than this. This is also a rather noisy hostel, however. I won't mind moving from here, though the city itself does seem rather nice.

Anyway, my time's up. Time to be moving along."

"event","Gah, tired. Had a 3:55 pickup for the airport this morning, which meant that I didn't really sleep last night. I'm tired and sweaty and uncomfortable, but check-in here isn't until 1PM and so far it's only 9:30. I bought a couple of hours of time on a computer, but the thing is so locked down that I can't actually do anything that I would want to do, except for the web. The computer has Yahoo Messenger and MSN, but no AIM or IRC. I shouldn't have bought two hours all at once. Anyway, sorry for being grumpy, I just wish that I could take a shower and do some laundry. And have a nap. I'm visiting someone for lunch at noon though, so that's probably not going to happen for a while. I do have a day to myself, in any case, so there'll be time to recoup. I kinda wish I were coming here tomorrow as it turns out that Jason is doing a solo show at a squat in Wellington tonight, and I'm going to miss it. Not much to be done about that, though.

Well, enough grumbling. Last night's show was pretty great, at least from my viewpoint. I guess I'm easily pleased though, because I spent most of it outside on the balcony attempting to sell merch, and due to our location sales weren't going so well. That's not so great for the bands, but I was just happy to be there, so I didn't mind too much. It *was* pretty damn cold out there though, and for some reason my socks were damp, so a large portion of the evening was spent in considering the level of uncomfortableness in my feet.

Some local band played in between The Red Paintings and The Dresden Dolls, and honestly they sucked pretty bad. Jason got to do a song just before the Dolls went on though (I guess this is going to be a regular thing, it sure ought to be in any case since lots of people never bother to show up for the first act and hence don't really see him play or buy his merch) and that definitely got the main show off to the right start. During his original set something happened to his accordion, and I guess it was fortunate that I'd popped in for a few minutes to watch him play, because I ended up getting up on stage and disassembling it with my Leatherman for him. He fixed whatever it was that had gotten munted, I put it back together (though I seem to have lost one of the pins) and it worked after that. That was a pretty cool experience actually, it's always good to feel useful.

I'm expecting tonight's show to go better for him than last night's, since he seems to like smaller, more intimate venues (and ones where he isn't relegated to a half-hour opening set) better than larger scenes. Can't say I blame him, I've always thought of him as basically a folk musician and such music thrives on the interaction between performer and audience, which is more naturally cultivated in more personal settings. He seemed kinda off after last night's show, and he said he was feeling a bit down. I hope tonight's act is more fun for him. He has a couple more solo shows on this tour, and I'm going to make sure that I'm around for them.

Speaking of which, I do have to buy some tickets. Should have the money now to do that, so I will. Just gotta figure out the schedule... shouldn't be a problem.

Coming into Australia was only slightly more troublesome than New Zealand, and probably mostly because I was feeling so tired and haggard. I got questioned a little bit more thoroughly (and by more people) during the process, but nobody seemed like they were considering not letting me into the country. I'm here now in any case, so I just have to avoid getting kicked out, which hopefully won't be too hard. ;-)

Hopefully I don't have to deal with anymore super-early flights. I should have some choice in the matter, there's a fair amount of flying going on between the major East Coast cities.

Anyway, I guess that's it for now. I'll write more if I think of anything. Probably I will, after I've finally had a chance to shower, put on clean clothes, and have a nap."

"event","Well, I'm in Wellington. The flight over here was as painless as could be, but getting to the airport was a bit troublesome. The AirBus driver blew right past me at the stop despite my being on the curb with my arm out, and I had to take a taxi which ended up being aout $35 more than the bus ticket would've been. Most annoying. I didn't actually have quite enough money for the fare as it turned out, but the driver was very kind about it. He got one of my CDs for his magnaminity. I also gave a CD to a guy who helped me find my stop coming here on the bus.

Tomorrow's flight is at six in the morning. I kinda wish I was flying out a day later as Jason is doing a show somewhere around here tomorrow, but the flight is set. I'm not sure how I'm going to get to the airport, I'll have to ask somebody here at the Rosemere. This is quite an interesting house, everything's very cheerful and brightly painted. There's a friendly calico here named Bella, and most of the patrons (at least today) would seem to be women. All in all not a bad place. The internet is free here too, by reservation in half-hour blocks, but the computer I'm using does suck mightily. Beggars can't be choosers, though.

Looks like I'll be getting into tonight's concert for free as well, which is a plus. Last night the merch table was kind of in an awkward spot, hopefully tonight's is somewhere where it'll get more business. Between Jason, Dallas (the manager for The Red Paintings), and myself, it was pretty easy keeping it staffed. Should be a good show, I think.

Wellington is a nice town. It's very pedestrian-friendly, again with lots of the little independent shops that I'm growing used to seeing around here. Lots of good food, Thai and Chinese and lots of cheap bakery goods, which is mostly what I've been eating. Wednesday night is Free Soup night here at the Rosemere though, which is cool. Free breakfast here also, but of course I'll not be around for it, flying out as early as I am.

I spent nearly the whole flight from Auckland to Wellington taking photos out of the plane window. It was great conditions for it, with plenty of sunlight and enough clouds to be visually interesting but not so many as to seriously obscure the landscape. Also there was a good mix of terrain, water and farmland and mountains. The photos are of course going to require some significant processing to remove the dingyness of the airplane porthole through which they were taken, but with a little work some of them should prove decent shots I think. Wellington itself has yielded a couple of interesting pictures as well. I'll post them when I get to Adelaide, since I don't really have the kind of computer access here neccessary to download, process, and upload the photos. They'll be in my Flickr gallery -- I'll provide links.

Well, I only have four minutes left on this machine. The computer room apparently closes at 10PM, so I won't be able to write just after the show. Just as well really, since I'm probably going to be getting up at 4AM at the latest. Not going to get so very much sleep tonight, that's for sure. I really should get an alarm clock. My internal one is pretty good (I had no trouble getting up at seven this morning) but I'm not sure how well I trust it without sunlight being involved. We'll just have to find out, I suppose. If the show runs late enough I'll just not sleep until I get to Brisbane. I do have an extra day there, so it should work out if it has to. And of course I'll be able to nap on the plane as I'm crossing the Tasman Sea.

Well, that's it for today. Talk to you all later.

"event","Now that's more like it. Just got back from the first of the main shows. Much better atmosphere for me this time, despite the club being packed so tight that crossing it was a ten-minute process. There was a nice beer garden outside where one could get away from the crowds, and I got to meet the various artists and help out a little bit from time to time. Jason and The Red Paintings (who are also on this tour) opened, and their sets were a little too short if you ask me (they only got half an hour each) but both did great despite some technical difficulties here and there.

I'd never heard of The Red Paintings before (I knew they were on the tour, but hadn't bothered to give them much thought) but they were definitely up to the level of the groups that I did know. They're an Australian group, from Brisbane, and all of them seem like great people. It turns out that they're staying here at the Bamber House tonight (I knew there was a group moving in, but nobody told me it was one of the bands I was going to be seeing!) and they gave me a ride home, which was nice since I wasn't relishing the thought of a half-hour walk very much. Great people. They're touring Stateside with the Dolls right after this business, and if they're in my neck of the woods I'll probably have to find a way to go see 'em.

I got to see the concert for free, which was great, but what I really appreciated was having a job, minimal as it was. It was a *loud* concert, so it was good to be able to get outside of it every so often. The Dresden Dolls in particular were loud enough that had I not been wearing a belt, I might have been blown out of my pants. The energy level was incredible, and all the acts seemed to interact well with the audience and to be able to work around the occasional crisis (such as one of the TRP members forgetting her violin) and really bring the audience into the show. At one point Amanda from the Dolls forgot the words to a Metallica song that they were covering (don't know if that was staged or if she actually blanked) and actually brought up someone from the audience to finish it, karaoke style, which said audience member did with great gusto and thrashing of hair.

In general, a good time was had by all. I'd write more, but I need to head to bed. I have a plane to catch, after all. I'll write next time I have a chance... don't really know exactly how busy I'll be tomorrow, since I haven't done this before. There will be another show tomorrow night though, and hopefully it'll go as well as this one did.

See y'all. Hope everyone is well."

I spent a couple of hours today trying to find the King's Arms (Auckland's streets aren't exactly well-labeled) and another couple in the Auckland Museum of Art, which is free on the ground floor and rather nice

My favorite part was the portraits by Charles Goldie. He painted dozens of character portraits of important Maori figures, and they are absolutely gorgeous. All of them are done with this dark, luminous, highly detailed style that seems as if it's almost glowing. His subjects are frequently painted with a good deal of personality and character. <a href=""http://www.worth1000.com/web/media/3239/All_e_same_te_Pakeha_1905_71.jpg"">Here's</a> an example of what I'm talking about, though of course the photo really doesn't come close to doing it justice, capturing neither the level of detail nor the range of color, and certainly not that strange, self-lit glow that fills all of the paintings in real life. Incredible stuff.

Didn't make it down to the port after all, I just didn't feel like walking that far. If I had another day I'd probably do it on the bus, but as it is I think I'm just going to make my way back to the hostel now and try to figure out how I'm going to make it to my flight tomorrow. I *think* I have it sorted, but it can't hurt to take another look at what tomorrow's schedule will look like. Wake up, pack up, shuttle, airplane, probably another shuttle, check in at Rosemere, orient myself in Wellington, go to the concert. Doable, but the more prior planning the better. Somewhere in there I have to plan the *next* day as well, wherein I will be flying to Brisbane and crossing another international border. And I don't have any flights booked past Brisbane as of yet. I should do that today. Not on this computer, though. A message would probably pop up saying ""Do you want to post your credit card information on 4chan? yes/no"" in Korean, and I'd have no idea that I was giving ten thousand b-tards full access to my bank account. Not such a great idea. Anyway, it needs doing. 

Dad supposedly picked up my cheque today (thanks Dad!) so I should have a cash influx soon. It's bigger than I expected (forgot that I got a small raise toward the end of the season) which is definitely a good thing, and also apparently I'm not paid up to the last day of work yet, so I should be getting even *more* money before all this is over. That feels pretty good.

Well, that's about it for now, folks. Good luck to y'all out there."

"event","Concert was awesome. I was fairly uncomfortable, usual crowd anxiety stuff, but Jason was teriffic as usual. Looking forward to seeing the Dresden Dolls tomorrow, for the first time. Getting a little lonely out here... I'm gonna have to find some more energy, try to be more outgoing and less nervous and hesitant. I find that I'm usually on a somewhat different wavelength from those around me, though... and that makes things a bit difficult. It's hard to pretend to fit in when one has such difficulty trying to find common ground. Generally speaking I'd much rather be going my own way of course, but enjoyment of bar culture seems predicated on going the same way as the other patrons. Worth it, though, for the spectacle. 

I'd almost forgotten what the difference was between Jason Webley on a disc and Jason Webley in person. Apocolyptic is a word that gets used again and again, seemingly independently by many different people. It's apt. It's ecstatic, wild, overpowering. The rest of the audience didn't quite clue in to the atmosphere that Jason was trying to project, but I'm sure that's true for at least four out of five venues. Passionate audience participation is a hard thing to try and inspire, there are many barriers to overcome. There's a bit of a parallel involved there. The main difference is that Jason just drives on, heedless. I, on the other hand, run out of steam pretty quick. S'ok, though. I'll get it in the end.

I'm feeling a little bit lonely tonight, might almost say homesick. Trouble is, I don't really have a home but for where I happen to rest my feet for the night. I'm OK with that. I just miss easy companionship, I guess. I'm not totally comfortable. I should hardly expect to be though, in a strange country in a strange house surrounded by strange people, most of whom seem to have brought friends with them and few of whom speak English with those friends. There are lots of people from France and Germany here. Nobody from the States, though. That's not really the issue though, that's really more of a minor side thing. I'm an outsider in all situations, save perhaps for my island.

I'm not nearly as morose as I may sound, these are just musings. I'm vaguely lonely, but overall I had a great time tonight, and expect to have an even better one tomorrow. Day after that I have a flight *and* a concert in the same day... that's gonna be a bit tough. It'll be the Status Quo for a while though, so I'll have to be prepared. Should be OK.

Oh, I bought a harmonica today. I rather like it. Good harmonica.

See, one thing that Rugs (I'll try it spelt that way this time) and I noticed, being the two beardiest guys in the bunch, was that when one puts one's chin down into a flowing stream, it creates a noticable ""beard drag"" whereupon one's beard tries to run away independent of one's face. This inspired Rugs to decide that he was going to become a champion swimmer, with all his body shaven except for a mighty beard which would trail behind him. I suggested that he wax his beard into a more hydrodynamic shape, and then mayhem immediately ensued as we proceeded to envision beard-themed versions of almost every activity imaginable (beard bungee jumping?) with all of the implications that such would entail. There was beard javelin, beard fencing, the hundred meter beard, and synchronized bearding to name but a few. The beauty of each of these sports, of course, is that while normal sports require equipment and/or specialized training, in beard sports everything is done with beards. Fantastic, no? To think, we may have been the first people ever to envision this. Future generations will look upon us as pioneers in beard sporting events.

I also mentioned that the car needed some repairs. You see, when we finally decided to back to the car, we discovered that it had been bleeding transmission fluid out onto the ground. Given that we were perhaps half an hour's drive from anything and a good three hours from the nearest major city, this presented something of a problem. Kaltezar, fortunately, is a supreme mechanic, and after topping off the transmission fluid he drove us to Rotorua where in a gas station he spliced the leaking transmission cooler line into the main transmission line, and we got home just fine in the end.

As I said before, it was indeed past nine in the morning when we got home. Sleeping in the car wasn't really a viable option, considering the fact that there were three people occupying a space designed for two, so at least one person had to be hunched forward on the edge of his seat at all times, and even the two who had more-or-less full seats had less than an optimal amount of sleeping space. Eventually we just crammed in tight and slept as best we could. Getting back to the <a href=""http://oaklands.co.nz/bamberhm.html"">Bamber House</a> though, I found someone else sleeping in my bed. I just took the nearest empty bed at that point, figuring that if its owner questioned me I could just sort of grunt and point at the situation in my own bed, and was asleep in approximately five femtoseconds. Someone did eventually notice, and when I grunted and pointed he just shrugged and continued about his business, and all was well. I awoke at about 5PM. So that's how my sleep schedule came to be flipped. I'm still tired though, and anticipate no problem in going to sleep at a normal time today. I had at least two days' worth of activity yesterday, not to mention the long flight that occured immediately preceding, so I don't feel too bad about just hanging around the hostel today. 

It's still pretty cold and wet out anyway, and by now it's dark and most things are closed. New Zealand has everything that the U.S. does (and many things it doesn't) but services definitely don't stay open as late. Even in Auckland, the largest city in the nation, most stuff closes around six. The bars are open of course right now, but I haven't the money. Also I still don't have the bus system totally figured out, and while I know which routes stop by here I don't know exactly where they go or how late they run. Mt. Eden *is* within walking distance of the city center as I proved to myself  yesterday, but I don't fancy a two-hour walk at night in the rain through a strange city if I can avoid it.

Some more thoughts on Auckland: The food is definitely to my taste. Meat pies, thai curries, kebabs (which as far as I can tell are actually what we in the USA would call gyros) and Indian fare seem to be staples here. There's also a thriving local beer industry, as well. Businesses seem to be dominated by independent shops rather than major chains, though there is always The Warehouse, which is pretty much the New Zealand analog of Wal-Mart.

Oh, and everybody who went to the hot springs with me got a copy of my CD, with the music and the photos and such on it. Also, that link for Zara's gallery is <a href = ""http://zarathus.deviantart.com"">here</a> and the link to a review of the bar where Rugs works is <a href = ""http://www.smh.com.au/news/bar-reviews/minus-five/2005/12/22/1135032119884.html"">this</a>. That particular Minus Five is in Sydney, but the one here is pretty much the same I'd imagine. And I think the one here is the original.

Stay frosty everyone,

"event","Well well, it's been a busy rotation. So much to tell, it's starting to overwhelm my poor, tiny brain. Last thing's first: Jason Webley finally got a chance to respond to the offer of help that I e-mailed him a few weeks back, and it looks like I'm going to be staffing his merch booth for at least some of his shows. It seems that this'll likely get me into said shows for free as well, which of course is a huge plus especially considering the extremely limited nature of my funds. I'm pretty excited about that, it's always cool to be able to help out someone that one admires. He seemed a little skeptical that I would actually want to try and keep up with this tour schedule, but hey, yeah, I do.

Anyway, that's that. The big story at this point is the story of how it is that I came to be nocturnal. My sleep schedule is completely upside down you see, I went to bed at 9AM this morning and woke up promptly at five in the afternoon. This has nothing to do with the fact that I'm on a different side of the planet from usual, and everything to do with furries. Allow me to explain...

I have a friend in New Zealand, name of Kaltezar, an Otherkin like myself. He's from the States originally but has been over here for several years now. If I remember correctly I'm pretty sure that he actually has citizenship at this point, but in any case he's a permanent resident. He's in touch with the local furries and otherkin, and he knew I was coming of course, so today he gathered up a bunch of people around six-ish and we all had dinner at a Denny's downtown. The Denny's-es here serve beer, by the way. It's a vast improvement. I can't remember ever being offered beer at an American Denny's. In any case, the dinner went well and I met some cool folks, but it was what happened *after* that was truly awesome. Kalte had this plan of getting together a couple of people and going down to Rotorua to visit the hot springs there. New Zealand has tons of geothermal activity, and Rotorua is the nearest big hot-spot. He invited me along, and of course I accepted gladly. So after dinner five of us got into his four-person car, and set out.

Our crew included Kaltezar of course (a dragon), Ruggs (a dog), Frix (a gryphon), and Zarathus (a zarathus). Zara is quite the artist, and I'd post a link to her site except that I don't seem to be able to get in touch with Deviantart right now. I'll be sure to do so later. Ruggs (whose name I'm probably misspelling) is a bartender at the Minus Five in Princes Wharf, a truly unique bar which is quite literally carved entirely out of ice. Actually, I'm not sure if he tends bar or what, I just kind of assumed since he seems a pretty sociable guy. Frix (whose name I also have no idea how to spell) is down from Sweden, apparently with the intent to stay here as long as he can, forever if at all possible. Anyway, we had to go to all of our respective houses in order to acquire towels and bathing suits and the like, and to put together a playlist for what was supposed to be a two-hour journey to Rotorua. It was about midnight or so before we actually left.

Finally on our way, the trip went by pretty well. The three guys (other than Kalte who was driving of course) were all crammed quite firmly in the back, but we made the best of things, and the choice of music certainly helped. We stopped somewhere along the line for some pies, and that helped too. The trip did end up taking rather longer than we'd expected however, and when we finally rolled into the hot spring (actually a bit of a ways outside Rotorua itself, in a much more secluded area than the general tourist-trap of the town proper) it was a bit past three in the morning. We all changed as quickly as we could in the cold, rainy air, and piled into the steaming water just as quick as we could manage. All but Zarathus that is, who displayed a most curious (and rather endearing) hesitancy to enter the spring. I've never seen someone act so much like one would expect their creature to do. The water was excellent.

I found all of the soreness and tiredness of the day washed away almost instantly. I just sort of stretched out on my belly, and I felt like nothing so much as a huge lizard just soaking up the heat. The warmth went straight up to my head and made me feel quite giddy and relaxed. We stayed for about two hours, enjoying the various parts of the pool, and had a lively conversation about various possible beard-themed sports. I'd explain that all in more detail, but I've got less than a minute left on this machine. I'll respond to any comments with greater details later, if I can.

Anyway, when we finally got out around five or six, it was another three ish hours back to the hostel. There were some repairs needed on the car... anyway, I slept in quite a bit. Gotta post, time's up."

"event","Well, miserable as the weather was today, I knew I had to go out and explore. I've put a few miles under my feet now, having walked through most of the main sections of the city. There's much more to explore, and there's no way I'll get to see it all before I have to go, but I'm pretty satisfied with what I've seen so far. Auckland seems like an interesting place, though all I've really seen so far are the shops. Those (especially the ones on K-Road) tend to be unusually intriguing, at least. All the walking has confirmed to me that I'm really not in shape for this sort of thing, though. My feet and calves are already aching, but I've done what I can to try to make them feel better. They're just going to have to get used to it.

I've spent an alarming amount of money today. That was to be expected of course, as there were several things that I needed to buy over here. I knew from the first that my first day in Auckland was going to be an expensive one, but I'm going to have to do my best from now on to keep the spending to a minimum. Shouldn't be too hard, as long as I can avoid the temptation to eat out. I really have all the equipment I'm going to need, at this point. The most exciting thing that I bought to day was a hat. It's a black, leather, wide-brim type thing, and I got it at a military surplus shop that sold many fantastical objects. They had used parkas from the South Pole, medical implements from the second world war, bomber's helmets... excellent stuff. I wish there were such a place near Duxbury. My hat is technically an irregular, since its brim isn't quite a perfect circle, but I doubt if anybody is going to notice while the thing is on my head. It's just the sort of hat I wanted in any case, and if it's slightly irregular, then so much the better. I'm slightly irregular myself, after all.

My shampoo exploded in my bag while I was flying across the country. I cleaned it up as best I could, but I'm going to smell like Pantene for a while. Oh well.

I bought a $2 vial of rose scent for the velvet rose that I've been carrying around with me. It serves as a charm, something to take care of and to have with me other than the strictly utilitarian objects that inhabit my pack. Since I lack any compatriots on this trip, it helps to have something to act as a focus. I guess it's become my security object. Also I can use it as an identifier for when I'm meeting with people, since I tend to be the only person in a given area carrying a red velvet rose. I found the thing in the Nantahala forest almost a year ago, and it's been in my van ever since, except that I sold my van. So now it's woven into my hatband. I happen to think it looks rather nice there.

Well, that's really about it for now. I'm just going to sit and relax for a bit, and then I'll make a foray to the grocery store to purchase some food supplies. After that it'll be dinnertime, and then time to go meet Kaltezar and whoever else he decided to stir up. And when that's over, I think it'll definitely be bedtime. I'm a little tired already, more from all the walking than from the time zone difference I think, though the zone thing probably is playing its part too. Also there's the fact that I only got *maybe* four hours of sleep last night. There are various factors. I'm doing well, though. Things are going pretty nicely here.

See you all later."

"event","Well, I'm in Auckland. Don't have much time to write, but I'll do what I can. The flight was pretty painless, considering its length. I feel like I'm doing OK with the time-zone shift, as well. Customs and Immigration were also painless. I'm now at the Bamber House, my first hostel, waiting for 8:30 to roll around so that I can check in. I have friends to meet in the evening, and I've met an older guy named Phil who seems quite friendly. People are just waking up, apparently last night was a bit wild and a lot of people are still asleep and/or drunk. It's raining lightly outside, but my impression of Auckland from what little I've seen is nonetheless a good one. I haven't had a chance to really explore, though -- that's my main priority for today. I need to get situated, get oriented, and generally figure out what's going on. Shouldn't be too much of a problem. It's raining and somewhat chilly though, so I think I'll take things fairly slow today.

It's early to say, but so far the trip seems to be going pretty smoothly. I haven't forgotten where my towel is.

I'll write more here when I get the chance, and when I have more to write about. So far I'm just settling in (or waiting to) and trying to talk to everyone I meet. Numerous children's books notwithstanding, talking to strangers is definitely a good thing to do.

Talk to you all later,

"event","so today was lame. i cant sleep so much on my mind. i miss my girls so much its really starting to affect me more everyday. now the one thing that kept my sanity in place has turned their back on me basically. i just need a break. ive poured my heart out for too many people and i end up in the same place everytime. its not fair but i guess thats where my life was supposed to go. i dont consider myself to be the best choice for anyone, i mean there is always something better, but i truly felt that i am good for her. maybe we wouldnt have worked out, maybe we would have broken up anyway. i probably will never kno the true outcome of this situation. i think i should talk to someone, maybe they can help get my head straight. at least one positive, kodiak detention is almost up! yay"

"event","yea this journal is getting a little repetative but thats what happens in my life. i met an amazing person about 2 months ago. smart, funny, stunningly beautiful. i probably let myself get too close too fast, but this person brought out a side of me that i thought that i'd never find again. hitting things off the way we did and how great we got along was amazing. i thought we had a good thing, we'd joke about being stuck with each other, and shit like that, i mean i want a relationship with her, but she is still wrapped around past shit. i just dont know how a person can go from saying that they cant wait to see me in july and that they are excited to take a trip to san diego with me and possibly crash for a while, to telling me that they think they are still in love with their ex. how come i cant avoid these fucking situations? is it too much to want someone who cares about me!? i loved feeling that someone was happy to talk to me and hear from me, now im back to being alone and miserable. i really want to just hold my kids at least i know thats one thing no one can take from me."

"event","so officially today she told me that we cant work out, because of how we fought. what a fucking cop out. if you dont want to be with someone then just say it. or if you are afraid of what could be then say that too. dont lead a person on for weeks and then let them down, in text nevertheless. why am i cursed to be unhappy. i mean isnt it bad enough that i cant see my kids everyday? or that i am wasting away. i have no motivation. no drive for anything. i thought that what i had was good. i thought she could be good for me, i thought that one day it could be something great. i have never been a very optimistic person, and this is why. i had hope, i had faith and this is what it got me. fucking shot down. well lets see what more fucked up things can come my way"

so this was my first week in alaska and all i have to say is breathtaking!!!!! ive never been somewhere so clean and untouched as it is up here. i mean where else can you go and see glaciers and a flock of fucking bald eagles flying around. its simply stunning. i really wish that i could share these experiences with some people that are close to me. but thats just the thing about getting old. you have to grow up sometimes and move 5000 miles away to do what you really wanna do in life. i dont know who really is gonna take the time to read this but who cares. i needed some thing to talk to. ehh whatever."

"event","uh i feel so lost these days, i dont kno what to do with myself. seriously i think that the only thing i can really do is grow up and leave here and get my life in order. so by this i have 2 options in mind. one moving back to florida and go to college there. at least if i go there i have ppl there i kno, old friends and my cousin. so i wont be totally out of the loop. or the second one which i dont kno if i will do but its still an option, and that is joinin up with the united states coast gaurd.i have been doin my own research on this and there are two jobs that i think i would do and they are, gun mate or operations specialists. idk how sure i am of this but i am gonna take some time and visit the recruiters. and i kno that the coast guard isnt that bad cuz my cousin was in it and he loved it, so i think i would fit in, who knows what life has for me all i kno is ineed a change of scenery to start helping myself and my future.


if anyone is interested in the 2 jobs i had talked about click here

"event","Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining 
Like a star that can't wait for the night 
I hate to think I've been blinded baby 
Why can't I see you tonight? 

And the warmth of your smile starts a-burnin' 
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright 
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning 
Why don't you show up, make it all right? 
Yeah, it's all right. 

And if you promised you'd love so completely 
and you said you would always be true 
You swore that you would never leave me, baby: 
What ever happened to you? 

And you thought it was only in movies 
As you wish all your dreams would come true 
It ain't the first time believe me, baby 
I'm standin here feeling blue 
Yeah I'm blue 

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner 
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown 
Another ten minutes no longer 
And then I'm turning around 

The clock on the wall's moving slower 
My heart it sinks to the ground 
And the storm that I thought would blow over 
Clouds the light of the love that I found 

Now my body is starting to quiver 
And the palms of my hands getting wet 
I've got no reason to doubt you baby, 
It's all a terrible mess 

I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless 
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey 
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless 
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah 
Light of the love that I found..."

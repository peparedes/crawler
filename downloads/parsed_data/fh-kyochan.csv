"event","How long did he have? 

Kyo itched at the cast on his arm moodily. This semester would be ending soon, and summer would begin. He had realized he didn't want to go home.

What was he going to do?

"event","Kyo had refused offers of help in taking his bags back to his room. He regretted that now as he slogged up the stairs and avoided the numerous children running around the halls.

Carrying luggage with cracked ribs, a broken arm, and a gash in his leg (stitched shut and bandaged, courtesy of Hatori) was not an experience he would wish on his worst enemy -- even that damn Rat, Yuki. 

He climbed the four stories and opened the door with his newly regained key. Then he pushed it open, and dragged his aching body inside. 

He flung himself back on the bed and closed his eyes. It was good to be home.

<small>[OOC: Open to the roommate, if he so desires -- and anyone else for that matter. C'mon ya'll, let's welcome Kyo home!]"

"event","Kyo shut his last suitcase. In the event that Akito decided he couldn't come back -- which was all too likely -- he had packed everything. His side of the room was bare.

He drew in a deep breath, and was surprised to feel wetness strike his eyes. He hadn't spent that much time here really, but it had been fun all the same. Peter had been a blessing in many ways.

He scrubbed at his eyes with one hand, and left a note on Peter's bed, explaining that he had to leave and that if Peter would just call the number he had written, he would be able to give him the gist of what happened.

Kyo sincerely doubted that his -- former -- roommate would call.

Thinking of something, he <a href=""http://untouchableskin.livejournal.com/451.html?thread=635843#t635843"">picked up the phone and called Marie</a>. Feeling at least somewhat better, he took one final look around the room.

Then he left, knowing that he might never see it again.

<small>OOC: This is to cover my choir's Spring Trip this weekend. Kyo will be back by Monday, no worries! He's gone now, but the post is open to the reactions of other players."

He felt ill; and he didn't like feeling ill. There was always the chance that he would transform, and that wouldn't do at all. 

He slid under the covers of his warm bed. It was at times like these that he really missed Tohru.

Personally, I don't think that's cool. Therefore, I changed the layout so that you can actually see what's going on.

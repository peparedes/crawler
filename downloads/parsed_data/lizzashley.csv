"event","Real quick: still haven't eaten out, yay! Got home last night late so I just ate a quick sandwich. Tonight I made some random pasta thing since Chris had already eaten and I didn't have the cream of mushroom soup I needed and didn't feel like having Chris take me out to get just that. I almost ordered! Thankfully not. Put Easter money in cruise fund and I feel good about it. Tomorrow is tutoring so I am going to put that money in the pet sitting fund. Unless someone wants to house sit for me and feed my kitties, than it is going to be $250 for a week :( So do let me know if you'd like to house sit and take care of basically one cat since our other one is antisocial. I fell asleep on the couch for over an hour and now I am still tired so I am probably going to go to sleep at 8:00 like a loser. First day back to work after spring break was okay, not great nor terrible. I just couldn't sleep last night. Anyhow, that is all for now."

"event","Since it has become increasingly expensive to eat out (although I do enjoy it occasionally) I am going to try and post nightly our meals and see if we can go (first) without eating out or ordering in for a week including weekends. We usually do it once a week because I get home rather late on Tuesdays. Therefore, stocked with a full freezer/fridge/pantry of thorough grocery shopping on Sunday, we should be okay. Provided if we run out of milk, I'd get milk since it only lasts about a week. So starting tonight here goes. 

Tonight my friend Beth came over to hang out and so I cooked since I know it is both costly for both of us to eat out. Now I ate out earlier with one of my friends so that doesn't count because she is highly allergic to our kitties and I don't want her to have a reaction, so we ate out and also I don't get to see her that often so it is nice to enjoy a meal together. This does not count if my parents choose to take me out to eat. Back to what we ate. I am also posting this so I remember the recipes I used. 

Dinner:

Home made steak and cheese sandwiches. I had some leftover green beans and mashed potatoes so I decided to put them in a frying pan with a little margarine/milk and cheese and they softened right up, really tastey. I also added a little sour cream after taking out of the pan. Everything was really good! I've made the steak and cheese before so I knew that'd be okay. Everyone enjoyed the meal. 

I hate throwing left over food away so I try within reason to reuse it somehow. Potatoes and veggies are of course the easiest to reuse. I hate buying frozen fries so I just buy a bag of potatoes and go from there. We have plenty of frozen/fresh veggies so those are easy to use too. I also this week already made up hamburger patties (complete with onions, bbq sauce, peppers into the patties) so those should be already to grill. Same with chicken breasts I put the marinade in the bag so those will be ready to bake. My biggest problem is now that my spring break is over (cry) I won't have as much time in the evening to prepare meals, so I need them to be fairly quick and as less steps as possible. I get a little more elaborate on the weekends. Also, storing fruit seems almost impossible in this place! I bought a watermelon and pineapple and finally ripened after this week and I cut up and put in the fridge. Any ideas on how to store strawberries to make them not get moldy after 1 or 2 days? I love to eat them, but I like to eat them in my lunches at work and don't feel like buying them every other day. Or ideas in general on how to make fruit salad last longer? I invite people to post recipes too that aren't too complicated or require many special ingredients since I have already been shopping for the month. 

Earlier this week I made a great stroganoff thing with hamburger meat...really good and easy too. On Tuesday I made a nice egg casserole with lots of veggies and spicy sausage. I could always add different veggies too. My mom liked it so I know it was good. So tomorrow I will post what we have for dinner so I can keep track for myself that we are not eating out. We need to save for our cruise (not to mention it'll save money for other things)! We are eating a late lunch at Chris's family for Easter so we may just eat leftovers (not exciting). I really just want to do this for us and hopefully go longer than a week and save some money."

"event","Since I fail at writing in an actual journal lately due to my hand cramping for whatever reason, I shall post here, or attempt to. I would much rather hand write though. Still fumbling in the job hunting process due to my lack of motivation for getting rejected and/or not hearing anything. As everyone knows I want another job, not only for monetary reasons, but for mental reasons. My job is mentally unhealthy. I will not write about it because it will turn into a 10 page rant. My hopes and dreams of becoming a kindergarten teacher as of now are sqaushed because there are none available and I don't have my teaching license yet because I can't afford all of the tests right away. Who has an extra $300 lying around? So I have been looking outside of my realm and trying to put my English degree to good use. Sadly, I don't have the experience to utilize my degree. Oh, the economy. 

Life is pretty much the same. Still no wedding plans or any to speak of. I am kind of tired of people asking me because I am enjoying being engaged and working on our relationship that needs some mending right now. I don't think jumping into marriage is the way to go folks. I can't say our relationship has been easy and I am not complaining. Chris still doesn't have a steady job and that is adding strain to our relationship which is sad, but things need to be paid. I could write more on that, but what is the point. The economy sucks so I guess I can't blame him too much. Although he needs to look more often. 

I have been reading a lot lately and am running out of books to read. The library has been great because I do love free books, but many of the books I want are already checked out. I can't afford to buy new books. I read the Twilight Saga, well most of it and I just can't seem to finish the 4th one. I finally read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn and what a fabulous book! I wish it didn't end so quickly. I am about to start The Memory Keepers Daughter and that poses an interesting plot, so I am looking forward to that. Couldn't get into The Story of Edgar Sawtelle, so I just returned it. I don't think I gave it a really good chance, but oh well. Water for Elephants was a great book too-ended too quickly. I am awaiting The Reader and Revolutionary Road so hopefully those will be good. The movies look great, but I want to read the books first. This just shows how much I want to be back in school. Sadly that won't be happening until I get a better job. I have to get a better job for the both of us...I see us living here for a while because I love this little condo and I'd like to make some improvements (minor things) since my mom won't mind. I see us here for at least another 4 or so years. I hope the economy picks up soon...

However, we need our second bedroom back. It is currently occupied by our roommate whom is never home, but yet pays a decent amount of our rent. We have so much stuff that we just need that closet. It is huge. Also, it would be nice to have a desk where I could work. I want to start writing my book. I always think of these good ideas and then I forgot them. I need my own space. Having my laptop in the living room isn't really my idea of space. Also Chris could have an office again and than we could have a dining room to actually sit in. I'd like to redecorate (slowly) stuff since we have the freedom to do so now. It is different living in a condo in which you actually own (well my mom will). 

I have fractured my ankle (like two weeks ago) so I am currently not driving which is a real bummer. I have this walking cast boot thing that I have to wear for another 4 weeks (or more) so I am kind of sad I can't talk walks and enjoy the nice weather we have been having. Hopefully it'll be off in time for my birthday because I would actually like to wear cute shoes instead of this boot. We are going on vacation (finally) in June. A cruise to the Cayman Islands in Mexico. I am so excited because school will be out so I won't have to dread coming back too much. I will have to do some serious job hunting though or else I am going back to the crazy room, without a raise I might add since they froze pay, lovely. I already made peanuts and I'll still be making peanuts. 

I feel very limited in the way of friends. My best friend I hardly see even though she is like 30 minutes or less away. She has shacked up with some guy. I do not approve. She has really changed and not in a good way. I know we all change and grow and all that crap, but I mean she has digressed. She doesn't care about her health anymore and I am really nervous for her. I mean I know I am not the spokesperson for health, but I do try and I go to the doctors when need be. I am supposed to hang out with her tomorrow at her place, but I am little nervous, I don't think it is clean. Also I don't feel like sitting there and watching people play computer games. We'll see. On a good note I am seeing my other friend from college tomorrow morning which makes me quite happy. We are lunching somewhere good. She is so graciously coming to pick me up. Hopefully I'll get to see my friends a little further away soon once I get this boot off. I haven't forgotten you guys, just limited in my driving abilities. I just feel I have lost a lot of my friends which I don't necessarily think is all my fault. Oh well, I guess what happens is what happens. I guess I will go back to horror movie watching. 

Any book recommendations? I feel I am running out, which actually kind of scares me. I highly recommend all of Augusten Burroughs books, especially his new one which I read last year, A Wolf at the Table. There is another book (not by him) that I randomly bought at the library because it was $1.00, but I don't remember the title of it, but is soooooo good. I couldn't put it down. It was one of those books that I delayed reading for a while because I was like eh, it doesn't look promising, but I was shocked. It totally mirrored my relationship now, well in most aspects. I want to read it again. Sigh. This is what I have become, a book worm. Guess that is all for now..."

"event","what does it matter anymore? why even bother wasting my breath to voice my opinion? it doesn't fucking matter, everything I say just goes into this deep black void. I'd have more luck carrying on a conversation with a fucking brick wall. I wish you weren't fucking moving. I yearned for that month by myself. You had to quit your job because you were 'angry'. Everyone is angry with their jobs, get over it. No one wakes up and says: ""YES!! I am so ready for work."" Okay so maybe some people, but they aren't normal. 


So my dad calls me and I ponder not answering the phone because I really don't feel like talking to him right now, but I answer anyway. My grandma had a stroke today. My dad's mom. She is babbling incoherently and not making any sense. She knows where she is and my grandpa, however they have located some bleeding in her brain. From the sounds of it, there isn't going to be much they can do because she is 82. My poor grandpa is going to die then himself because he cannot live without my grandma. This is a fucked up situation. Just fucked. I don't know if I am more worried about my dad or my grandma. My dad is like everything to me and to hear/see him upset it just kills me. I like don't know what to do to help him. There isn't anything I can do. There is nothing I can say to make him feel better. Seriously god hates me. Everything always has to come all at once. A year after my aunt's death which I am still not okay with and now this. Seriously, what the fuck god? My dad said he'd call me when he knew something more. She has to get an MRI or something tomorrow. He is going to see her on Wednesday, but I just don't think I can right now. I have problems as it is. Seeing my aunt two weeks before her death was just awful. It is like you know death is coming and it almost makes it worse. It is like you don't know when it is going to happen, and then it just does, the day you just don't expect it to. It is like death almost tricks you and makes you believe they will make it a little longer or that it isn't going to happen, that the doctors found out this new treatment they could try. Sadly it never happens that way, why? When my mom called me at school to tell my about my aunt, I just sat down on the bench and cried in front of all those people, which is something I never do. I hate showing any type of weakness in front of anyone, it is even hard in front of my own parents. I hate crying, it is so weak and shameful. It never really accomplishes anything. and who the hell am I supposed to talk about these things with? My mom? So i can upset her even more? Absolutely not, so I just don't talk about it and try not to think about it. It is like I never give myself a time to grieve...how does one grieve? I find myself that I am more like my dad and I just never really come to terms with anything and try to rationalize that death is a part of life and that it of course, happened for a reason and that it happens to everyone, eventually. That statement possesses no emotion, which I think I need to start showing or I may very well have an emotional breakdown. I don't want to talk to my friends because one cannot understand unless they have experienced it themselves or if they have, it is just a different experience for everyone and it is so hard, so hard. So they in turn (by no fault of their own) seem distant and uncomfortable. It is a very uncomfortable topic is put forth on to my friends and no one knows what to say, I mean what do you say? How many I'm sorry's can one hear? I know everyone means well and I don't really know what I expect anyone to say, really. I am just so angry, angry at everything. I hate pulling the old, woe is me, my life is so hard, when people lives are so much harder. However, I am going to pull that card, my life is an utter shit hole right now. I am alive, wahoo! barely. emotionally I am a fourteen year old suicidal wreck. I don't have answers for myself and I don't know if anyone does, yet I am searching for answers and I crave them. I just need to rationalize things and I need to know what to do...how to help. How to be a human and say the right things in the worst possible scenarios. I talked to my mom because I didn't know what to say to do my dad except whimper out an ""i'm sorry dad"", which sounded utterly lame. My mom tried to talk to me about other subjects and it helped a little, however I dread that phone call at work tomorrow when she calls me to tell me how my grandma is doing. I mean what do I do?  I txted my brother but no response. I am not sure he knows yet, and if he does he is just ignoring it as he usually does. I have to be the emotional ladder for my brother and mom, I hold everything in so they can let everything out and I console and stay strong for them. However, this is my dad, the one person I truly cannot live without, the one person I feel truly connected to and now he is hurting and there isn't anything i can do to help him. I feel like this is some type of cruel game and there is no winner. How many times can a person just get beaten down until they just don't get up again? Aside from all of this, I have my own personal battles going on here, that are just far too petty to mention now. I am juggling too much and am just going to fall down, eventually. Now that I have wasted a whole box of tissues, I have to go lay down before my headache becomes a migraine. God damn those migraines, another evil invention. I need to get something far stronger for them that just puts me to sleep."

"event","I graduated last Thursday and it frightens me terribly, but excites me in some minor sense. I love school, I am one of those people that could stay in school forever and be perfectly happy. I wanted to start grad school right away, but foiled by money and not many options that excite me in MD. Pressured by my parents, I have thrown myself into the public school system half heartily looking for a job. I went back to Goddard because that is my comfort zone, I crave that zone. It isn't exactly what I want to do, I ideally would like to teach kindergarten, but that is a hot commodity, so I don't think I will find that position for a while. I desperatlly want out of MD, it is like a horrible black hole sucking me in more and more. I want away from this dingy state. I liked UMBC, but aside from that, I see no place that really struck me. I want to go back to school and take classes I want to take, but sadly, I don't think that is going to work out. I couldn't delay becoming and 'adult' any longer. Although I guess I could have lied and said I needed more classes, but damn UMBC for sending all my mail to my dad's house and not letting me change my address. So now I sit here, biting my nails and panicking about what the hell I am going to do with my life. At the age of 23 I thought I would know, I went to school for teaching, so I should teach, right? What if I don't want to do that after student teaching for 2 years? What if I want to be a writer who writes because it makes me feel better, but doesn't make any money? Sadly, fantasy doesn't mingle with reality, I am stuck being this adult that I am not ready to be. You can write on the side, for newspapers and magazines, is what they tell me, but what if that isn't fulfilling? I don't want to report news or dabble in reviews and critques. I want to write for me.  What good is a masters in English? What are you going to do with it? I fumble for a response and muffle out, I enjoy all aspects of the subject. Money, what are you going to do about that? Work random jobs as usual and quit when it gets too petty and find a new one for a couple months. And your family? I guess you are afraid I will disappoint the family because I didn't make something of myself in which I procure a hefty check to ""make it"" in this world. What if I don't need that satisfaction? The future, your children? I don't have children right now and who knows if that will ever come true. Sure I love children, but who knows? What if I change my mind or can't or I don't find my soul mate? So you are saying you are breaking up with him? No, but things are starting to slip, fall, I guess. That's an entirely different subject that I have an internal conversation about everyday. 

I love you, but is that what I really mean? That mundane phrase has become commonplace. I don't even know if I believe you when you say it. I know time dissolves and it is the the job of the couple to trick time and fabricate. To pretend that the love and spice is still there. Isn't it supposed to be, isn't that what a good couple is? Always in love, forever and ever. What if I have changed my mind, yet am not really certain at this stage. I am so indecisive it hurts. I am not always mad at you, you just try really hard to make it so I feel this way. You don't even try to bring joy to my life. I guess you prefer it this way so I won't talk to you. Is that your evil plan? Half the time I am mad at myself or depressed for an entirely different reason that I don't even know what the reason is. That is just my disposition and quite frankly I think, I THINK i am okay with it. It is more of an acceptance of how it is. I could change that if I wanted to by seeing a professional who could train me to speak about how I feel and perhaps see the brighter side of life. However, I don't consider myself an unhappy person all the time, sometimes I do enjoy what I am doing and I certainly enjoy my friends and family. However, it only lasts for so long, that feeling of joy slowly starts to disappear, like coming down from a high. However, contrary to a drug addict, I don't go out looking for my next high. I am okay with the feeling of disappointment. I haven't learned how to talk about my feelings, my true thoughts unless it is to a computer or paper. I have seen shrinks and have left feeling lackluster. Sure I could have found someone else, but I just shrug and go back to the other more pressing items on the never ending to do list. I don't know if I am ready to share, to open up yet. I fear I might sit in the chair and stare and never say a word having this stranger staring back at me waiting for me to answer a trivial question of how I am feeling today. 

The weight of knowing I am the backbone for my brother and mom is too much sometimes. I hesitate to tell them everything because they are too weak. I have to become the strong one for both. I balance their feelings and mine and try to spread comfort to both. I am still not other my aunt's death, and neither are my brother or mom, although both try to hide their feelings. I do too, as not to upset myself or them. Dying is a part of life and eventually I will accept that, although I hate it and it is out of my control. I feel as though I need to be closer to my family, yet don't want to live too close, in fact, I don't know where I want to live. I need to travel and see other areas, however I have a weight attached to my leg holding me back. Your response only proves how unnecessary you value me staying here. It is useless to keep writing about because there I don't really have an answer for myself and i am not looking for anyone else's answer or pity! (So please don't give it or acknowledge anything I've said because I will ignore you.)

I feel more that I want to go back to living alone. I enjoy it, I feel weird for thinking that. I do like to be alone because I can whatever I want without anyone watching or have to put up with anyone. Not that I mind living with someone, I just think I got somewhat used to being on my own. Also I like to do things for myself (which I do anyway whilst living with someone) and not having to rely on others. I could be perfectly happy not talking, and I've tested that theory and it really doesn't bother me.

My dreams and aspirations are trickling right through my finger tips and I reach out and try to grab them and it only pushes them further away. I need to find someone with similar dreams...to share and make come true. As my friend told me, don't settle because you are comfortable. How can I convince my body and mind that is what I am doing with having a complete freak out? That is one of the hardest questions I ask myself daily and still haven't come up with an answer that I deem acceptable. I'm a waffler, I waffle back and forth with options, ideas, responses, questions, answers, and so far none are good enough to trick my mind. It's a teary question and an even tearier task to think about the answer. I trudge through and occupy myself with other menially jobs that require less thought provocative solutions. 

The one phrase I always resort to: I don't know."

"event","I thought I should fill everyone in on what has been happening lately...nothing. Well not exactly, I am gearing up to graduate in December, FINALLY! I'm nervous, scared, anxious, and excited at the same time. I have to start being a ""real"" adult. I don't know if I am ready for that type of responsibility. I fear I will always be one of those people who cling to school and never really get out. I want my masters in English and I do (kind of) want my PhD too. My dad said people who are always stuck in school can't face the real world. I agree to an extent, however I do like school (as much as I complain about it). I like learning about different era's and authors, although I'd much rather focus on my set little group that I love. This also means that I have to start paying for everything, since I was spoiled and my parents help me a lot right now pay for things. However, this just seems to be a fact of life, I'd be living on the side of the road if I had to pay for my car, insurance, food, and all the utilities here. I am trying to get a part time job at the library so I can pay for food when I start school tomorrow. So far, they haven't called me back. I need to apply at Old Navy too, although I don't want to do that either. I will miss working at The Goddard School, it was so much fun. I didn't quit, I can always return anytime I have days off and in December when I finish school. I just wish I could have a semester with no work for once. It was so nice at Shepherd when I didn't have to work, I actually had time. I barely have time to think sometimes. 

So I am moving home, well not exactly home. I won't be moving to Reston because it is too expensive, but I'd like to move further out towards Round Hill or somewhere down Route 7, not quite to Winchester though, I do need civilization. I am not happy in MD, I like UMBC, but I dislike the state of MD, it is horrible. If I can get a 6 month lease on my current apartment, I could be moving as soon as next March/April!! *smile* That would make me very happy. However, the leasing office is being a douche, and said they may have already signed us up for a 12 month lease, which isn't fair since I still had time to decide if I wanted to live here for another 12 months. Asses. So hopefully I'll know tomorrow if they will consider us for a 6 month lease. That would be so awesome because Chris finishes school in Feb, so that would work out perfectly. I could start saving money since I'd work full time in Dec after student teaching. So yes, the inevitable question, is Chris moving with me? Yes. If we live further out (basically in the middle of no where), then he'll move there with me!@ I know it is a compromise, but I think it is a good one, for the both of us. VA pays better and has better school systems. Also I miss my parents and my brother :\ As lame as that is, I see my parents quite a lot and he doesn't, so it makes more sense for us to move there. PA was the other option and it still very well could be if we cannot afford anything in VA. I would like to move to a townhouse of some sort because we have way too much stuff and I am tired of living in an apartment! I want to get another kitty, and most places won't allow 3 cats. I am also tired of dealing with elephants who seem to inhabit the fourth floor of apartment buildings. My dad and I guess me too, know a woman who works for Remax so that'd be cool. I really hope we get the 6 month lease, but I have a feeling we won't since I (it was my own fault) waited too long to turn the form in. However, I did turn it in on time and still have time, so I will argue. 

I am scared to student teach :\ 4.5 full days is quite a lot. I start tomorrow, going to meetings with my teacher and helping her set up the classroom. She is really nice, but she's such a good teacher, I just feel so inferior and that my lessons suck. She just knows what to do all the time, or at least she does a pretty good job of faking it sometimes. I mean I know I'll learn, but I still feel like a doofus. Sigh, hopefully I can survive the fall semester. And the Praxis II, jesus, that is going to be a hard test, actually 2 tests. I don't even know if I signed up for the right ones because no one ever explained which ones to sign up for, we were just supposed to figure it out on our own, lovely. I am so disappointed in the UMBC edu dept, it is just such a shame. All that money wasted. It is so disorganized and useless. I never feel like I know what is going on because nothing is ever concrete. There are too many maybe's and well, I am not sure. Never a yes/no answer. I need direction! Another mindless rant about UMBC...it's almost over though! I will feel very proud of myself for graduating though, I am looking forward to the feeling of pride and accomplishment. Plus my parents will be happy too :) 

So I got flowers the other day from Chris, which was totally random. I was mad at him for various reasons, the biggest really was that we never do anything because of our schedules. I wanted to go somewhere last Saturday and he totally fell asleep, I understand he was tired from work, but take like a 2 hour nap and wake up. Anyway, I was getting tired of it and he never thinks anything is a big deal. It's really annoying. Take a stand, get angry! It pisses me off more. So I totally didn't talk to him for like three days and just ignored him. It really wasn't that hard though because of our schedules and also I could not talk to anyone for a while and be content. So on Tuesday I was at work and my boss came in and delivered my flowers. I didn't think they were for me, but they were :) They are really pretty, all pink ones in a pink vase. So that made me happy and we talked about it afterward. Although, I still feel like he could show a little more interest. I'm not just a maid/cook. I feel like I could have a better boyfriend in a way, one that cares perhaps just a little more, makes me feel like I'm the only girl that matters. Cares a little more about what I believe in and my interests. I need a book nerd. That aside, I guess I should put more effort into caring about his needs and interests too. Although, I feel like I do. I was the one who encouraged him to take these computer classes and pushed him to do it. I know he could do better (job wise) so I wish he'd realize that. Such potential and I feel like he is wasting it on certain things and habits. I know it is true you can't change a person, they have to change on their own, but it is so defeating...sigh. I am happy, but there is always that feeling of, what if? Useless what if's! I want to get married...to him, eventually. Seeing all these people get married makes me have wedding fever, however, the divorce rate is not kind right now, so I don't want to be 25 and divorced.  Nor do I want to have a child that doesn't have a father figure (if at all possible). Needless to say though, I would like to be engaged, haha. Yes, for the very shallow reason that everyone else is, kidding. Honestly, I feel like it is the next step in our relationship. We've been dating for almost 3.5 years and lived together for just about 2 years. It seems logical in the next stage of commitment. We talked about that too and apparently he knows and will do it when the time is right. Pfft. We shall see. 

We are going to a wedding on Saturday, totally dislike the bride, totally not friendly. Personality is kind of a bust and rather rude. She isn't a super model so there is no need to be a snoot, rather homely looking if you ask me. I don't just say that because I don't like her, I say that because the groom is pretty hot and easy going, I don't know why he wrapped himself up with her. But anyway, his choice. I am not too enthused to go to this wedding because she's just annoying and I have a feeling everything will be so overly planned that it won't be fun. I don't have anything to wear to this wedding either, I haven't really decided what I am going to do about that either. I may try to go find a sun dress later this week, but I am not too thrilled for it. Hopefully we won't have to hang out with them as a couple that much. He is nice, but I don't really care for her. She doesn't like our cats either! Weirdo. She isn't welcomed if she doesn't like the cats. I am so mean :\ Then we have to go to another wedding in Oct, of which I shall not be attending because I have to be here for the cat's shot (thank goodness). I don't really like the bride either (a trend maybe?). She's just ungodly annoying...her voice. 

Otherwise, not too much is going on. Mary and Emily :\ Miss you both. Sigh, there needs to be more hours in the day or more days in a week. 

This is a very fitting song, it is grey outside and rainy. It's how I feel lately, in between and verwirrt. Kind of floating along. I don't really know what to feel or think lately. I want solitude, yet want attention too, but just from the right people. I crave alone time, which is something I haven't had in a while. Today is really the first day I feel alone and it's wonderful. Chris went to a bachelor party (tubing down the river, drunkly) which is fine with me. I just need time for me. I know I am a loner and independent. I loved living alone (with katzen, of course). I will be a crazy katze lady! Allein is what I need, I think. However, I can't have both, him and alone. I know I'd be lonely, sometimes, but distance. I do like living with someone, but I want to be an angry, depressed, alcoholic writer. Such hopes and ambitions I have! Seriously, that will be a stage in my life, I can see it now. I want to live on the water eventually, I want to see Maine, Oregon, and Washington. I need the sound of waves crashing, sea salt filled clothes. This is why I am a nerd and am looking at homes in Maine. All these dreams... 

I guess that is it for now. More later, I am sure."

"event","So, It's been a while. I changed my colors even though I am fond of the grey, it's just a part of my journal and I will probably change it back soon. I still live in the same place, but we are hoping to move! How exciting is that? I am pleased. More on that later though since we are going to look at places tomorrow. School is so yucky. I just really dislike it. I still have about a year left probably though. My edu classes are just pointless all around. Also, my senior seminar class for English is obnoxious, I am a little scared about it. Over all my life is still the same and boring (hah). I still work with the little children at the school and I think I enjoy the younger children a lot better than the older children in the kindergarten room. The younger ones are more needy and I like that, I'm a weirdo. I have nothing creative or witty to say which is sad. I read through some of the poetry I posted a while ago and it pleased me. I still have thoughts, but just nothing comes to me at the moment. I miss Beth quite a bit. She called me and I called her back, but I know she is busy, so I will try to call her again tomorrow. Emily, I am sorry we didn't link up today, I would like to see your house anyway so maybe we can figure out a saturday that is good for you and me. Mary I haven't talked to you in a while....where are you? Anyway, all my friends need to gather in one place so I can see them. I miss you all greatly even though I don't stay in the greatest of touch (I am horrible with the phone and don't really like it) so I am sorry. I guess that's all for now."

"event","So today is mother's day and I got into a fight with my mom. Isn't that lovely? Apparently, I cannot do anything with my dad and if I do then I get yelled at and my mom is mad at me. I spent all day with her yesterday because she broke her foot and i cleaned her house (not to her standards of course and I heard about that too) and then I went to my dad's and did I know I was going to go out to dinner? No, but I went. So my mom gets extremely mad at me today for it b/c I did not want to have dinner with her last night, and I didn't. I wanted to leave. I was planning on leaving and going back to MD, but I had to stop at my dad's for some stuff. I usually don't get to spend time with my dad that often b/c I am spending it with my mom. So I am a bad person for wanting to spend time with my dad. So now my mom is rather upset with me. Also, it is my fault her foot is in a cast and cannot go anywhere (not really, but apparently so). Also, the fact that my brother does not speak to her is my fault too! Well, he doesn't talk to me or my dad and of which I told her, but that is of course not the right answer. So I told her I would not be coming down anymore to see her or dad that I would just say in MD. I cam damned anyway I look at it. If I have to stay in md to finish homework one weekend, she gets mad. What the fuck am I supposed to do except not come down. I usually spend the majority of my time with my mom when i do go down to reston and i always have lunch with her and we usually go shopping or something, but since her foot is in a cast, she cannot. So, I got lunch for us yesterday, went to the grocery store (which I didn't do right either) and cleaned her entire apartment, granted I did not mind doing any of those things, but they just weren't good enough. I was rather irritated by 4:30 and wanted to leave. I was rather polite the whole day when I could have told her to shut the fuck up and clean herself, but I did not. She wants me to choose parents and I find that rather unfair and I won't do it. So she wants me to pity her and feel sorry for her, and I do in a way. I am sorry she broke her foot and cannot go anywhere, but I tried to spend time with her, but I can only take so much. Hence why I do not live with her. I spent time with my dad too, but not nearly as much time and that time is limited because he does not spend time with me when he has masters work to do or work to do. I feel sorry also that she and my dad are not together, but there is nothing I can do about that and it's time to start realizing that she has to do things for herself and on her own. My brother isn't going to help, she knew this, but never listens. I am all for helping her and seeing her, which I do as much know. I devote my whole saturday morning/afternoon to her and almost every saturday. She also gets mad when I get down there at 10:30-11am because apparently, that's too late. I have to get up at 5am to get there at like 7 because I dont get up early everyday of the week. So, as one can see, this is a no win situation for me. I cannot think of any way I can succeed in this situation except for just not going down there. It's easier if I do not, it would save me the grief. I enjoy going down there and spending time with her, but not if I am going to be made to feel bad or guility for spending time with my other parent or coming back to MD because I have school work to do. I just can't keep doing this. I am too sensitive of a person to deal with these types of feelings. I have tried as best I can to deal with the divorce and I try not to get caught up with those feelings because it only depresses me, but she makes it very hard. There is nothing to be done about that situation, it's over and cannot be fixed. It just makes me so sad because she makes me feel like a terrible person for having stuff to do! I can't spend every minute there. She makes me feel ungrateful and terrible, that is the only way I can describe it. Absolutely like shit of a person. It makes me cry and she knows this, yet still does it. So what a shitty fucking day. I have not accomplished anything in terms of homework. I am not blaming her, I have never blamed her for any part of the divorce and I never will, but I cannot keep going on like this. What am I supposed to do? I am sorry if i hurt her feelings for not having dinner with her, but i didnt know i was going to have dinner with my dad. I just didn't want to. I had been there all day, I was tired of the cigarette smoke and I was irritated because she made me feel like everything I did for her yesterday was shit and that I didn't do it right. I needed a break. So now that I totally feel like shit and for making my mom sad on mother's day I am done."

"event","So again I have not posted in a while. A lot has happened in this past week, my uncle died on Sunday so I had to go to WV on Monday with my mom to the funeral. I have never been to a funeral and it is something that I do not want to attend for a very long time. I felt bad for my mom because she's just had such a rough time. 
My car also decided it would be okay to break down on Friday while coming home from work. That was so not okay. It if finally fixed after $1630 later. Fixed for now I suppose. My bf had the audacity to call me dumb when my car broke down because apparently I was acting dumb since I did not know what to do. I have never had my car break down, let alone be stuck on the side of a highway during rush hour. Yeah that was real pleasant of him. Besides that I haven't done much except for try to catch up on homework and such. I just have a lot more reading to do and to start my damn English paper of which I have no ideas for. I finally finished my Anth paper and e-mailed it to him today. Shitty. I didn't go to work all week because I didn't get home until last Weds and I don't work Thurs and I didn't feel like going into work for one damn day. Not much else to report. 

I want to move, with him too, but I want to move out of this apartment because I think we could find something newer and less noisy further up the beltway. He won't move though and I don't see why not. It pisses me off sometimes that he says I always tell him when I'm upset (I try, that is what he wanted) and then he's like you don't tell me when you are happy. It should be obvious when I am happy. It's a no win situation. The job effort is worthless, I don't know what else to do. I can't get a job for him. I know he enjoys me going to work and going to school and paying for everything and then wonders why I'm in a shitty  mood when I come home because I have more shit to do when I come home since you didn't do it. Yes, I wonder why I'm in a bad mood when I come home. He wanted me to look up online courses so he could get his certifications, but why waste my time when I know he'll never apply for the loan? It's all pointless really. I should just stop asking how the job search is going because I know the answer- if he wanted a job, he would have had one by now. I don't want to leave, I love him, I just wish he'd realize that what he does, does infact impact me. Can't change people though... there is always an excuse for everything. I think that's enough bitching for now, I am going to try and finish reading for Anth."

"event","I haven't updated in forever. The day after Valentines Day, the most pointless holiday ever. I received presents from 18 lovely 3 year olds at work, they are too cute. I didn't expect anything though, what could I expect with a boyfriend with no job? I just won't talk about that. Onward to school. School is a lot this semester, Education classes are a lot more work than I realized. I enjoy them, most of the time.  I miss my English classes and my English buddies :( I am only taking one this semester, I hope to take a few in the summer so I don't fall too far behind. I feel so far behind in friendships. I ran into Kate in the commons and I've been meaning to hang out with her, but I just haven't yet. I do want to! It'd be a nice break from the boy. This weekend I have to take the stupid Praxis test for Education, like the SAT's, yet not as intense (I hope). Sadly, not this weekend Kate. Not much else is going on. I want to look for a new apartment because the parking situation here sucks, more than parking at my other apartment. I mean, I'd like to move with Chris, but he likes it here. I mean the apartment is big, but I'd like newer appliances and a place to park when I come home. Our anniversary is coming up in March and that's cool. I'd like to go out for it, but I doubt it. :( I don't know why I bother trying to plan going out places because it just never happens. It's okay though. I don't really have much to report. I miss my friends. I miss having money. I miss my friends more though. If I don't call you, it doesn't mean I hate you, or don't want to hang out with you, I just suck at calling people or responding to people. I do care and do want to hang out."

"event","So I got my grades and I have to re-take argumentation again because my teacher is and will always be a horrible bitch. I wanted to send her an email stating how horrible she was, but I refrained. Otherwise grades were fine, a 78% in Spanish which means no more spanish ever! No more foreign languages! Unless they spite me and change their policy. However, I was rather peeved I missed a B by 2 points. Damn teacher. 

Nothing really exciting has happened, went to Jenn's wedding and got to see Mary (!!!) which was really exciting. Jenn looked so pretty and very happy, I am happy for her. Chris still doesn't have a job, it's starting to really get to me. I know when things are due, he just seems to think they will disappear. I don't make nearly enough money because I have to go to school, which is something I feel as though he resents me for. I feel like I just don't do enough and it just isn't satisfying. I tell him nicely or rather ask him if he'll do things around the house and when I get home from work they aren't done so why bother asking him to do things? I've told him this many times, I'd rather do it myself because I know it will get done. Then he wonders why I'm mad. I get so discouraged when I see him chatting for hours online and not getting up while I'm cleaning or doing whatever. I do all the shopping (and pay for it too) and it's like I do nothing all day. I work 8 hours of the day and come home to cook, clean and sleep. And when I do want to see him and talk to him, he's too drunk or on the computer. We never have sex that much anymore either which does bother me to an extent, but I just give up on it. What's the point anymore? I think I should have continued to live by myself. It was lonely at times, but it had it rewards. There is so much more I want to say, but I am tired of looking at the computer screen."

"event","So I have decided that I am going to send a post card into postscret.com because I have many secrets and I will have to choose the most perfect one, which one? It's a secret of course. You will just have to wait and see if it gets posted. I have not posted in a while because I have had lots to do. School has been depressing (I think that is a good word for it) because I feel as though I am not getting anywhere. I struggle for mere grades of a C in certain classes and I curse myself for getting a C, what good is that? It's been beaten into my head that a C is equivalent to an F. Where is the logic in that? I mean I do not love C's, but sometimes they are all I can produce. I also miss my kitty very much. I still have his picture on the fridge. I will never forgot Moe Moe. I did however, not as a substitute or anything, get a little kitty and I named her Pixie. She is rather cute, but bad, but she is little she doesn't know any better. 

Sometimes I just feel I lack control in my life, like I do not know what I am doing with my life. Sure I am going to school, but it has not gotten me very far so far. I do not feel much smarter and in certain cases I feel like I have lost all sense on intelligence. 
Since I am all about changing topics I will change topics once again! Guess who I talked to the other day? Mike, yes Mike as in Marine aka I went stupid over. He's still the same except now I am in a relationship, so the things he says, he shouldn't and I do not know how to say no. I never know how to say no to anything. I do not reciprocate his actions, I just sort of let it be and get lost in my  memories of when we planned our life together. How truly sad and pathetic I am. I wallow in memories. 

I want to be published, not for the sheer fact of saying ""Yay! I got published and you didn't!"", but for myself so people can see that everything can appear just splendid on the outside, but deep in the depths of the brain, everything is not peachy, but confused, juxtaposed on what if's and forgotten words. I try to focus and pretend that I like everything, but sometimes I wish it would go back to way it was so I could hide my feelings easier without anyone noticing. I feel like everything is public now and I am too late to cover everything up. At least when I was alone, I could sit and cry and no one would hear. I must silently scream because I am too ashamed of anyone knowing. I am weak-sensitive, but it is more than that. My dad just used that as an excuse so I would not cry and would tell me to stop. I care too much. I trust too often. I need to gain the bitterness quality. It isn't neediness, it is the exact opposite, I like to push people away so I do not have to explain. I am afraid of confrontation, I am too shy to confront, to argue, to voice an opinion. I'd rather be stuck and bite my lip and do it, but sometimes my mouth does not permit me to do so. Sometimes I dig my finger nails into my hands and speak up and I stumble on every word and repeat all my sentences over because I'm dying on the inside to escape. I am left feeling mutilated and defeated. I feel ashamed."

"event","So I just found out the stupid bitch isn't sub-leasing my apartment, why you ask? Because her mother is a heinous Jewish new jersey bitch (that was racist and stereotypical, but it is extremely true and if you met her, you'd know too). When was she planning on telling me? She's a psychotic, delusional, stupid (really is), manipulate, compulsive liar, bitch. I HATE her. At least I can stop talking to her now and listening to her. I can stop hearing about her pretend boyfriend. She is fuck friends with a guy whom she pretends is her boyfriend when he only uses her for sex, why I'm not sure because she's not attractive in any sort of way. She can't even see people hate her and she cannot live with anyone because it is HER, not them. She's so psychotic that she wants to break a condom just so she can have this guys kids so she can be with him and move wherever he decides to move. What a fucking stalker. I hope that doesn't happen, the poor child. I wish I could tell all of the professors that we share what a fucking fraud she is. She doesn't deserve extensions or extra time on papers because she does not have a learning disability, that's giving people who do have a disability or really do need an extension a bad name. I hope she fails 391, Shakespeare (for the 3rd time) and 307 which also for 3rd time and then she can't ever re-take them. I asked her what the hell she has been doing since she hasn't turned in any papers so far, she said sitting in her room crying. What a fucking lying bitch. I hate people who do that. It's such a waste, she should be kicked out and they should let someone into this college who wants to learn and be involved in studies. She's just a waste of a person. Why am I complaining about her, because I HATE people like her and I wish I could expose her phoniness. Did I get extensions when my parents got a divorce and my mom had a nervous breakdown and I had to take her to the hospital at various hours at night, every night? NO. I managed to get A's and work 2 fucking jobs and still maintain a stable relationship with my boyfriend. I only called out of work like twice so I could take my mom to the doctor.  I was still a damn good employee and a good student. I'm just furious at her for not telling me sooner. 

So now that is over, school is awful and I don't know why it is so awful this semester. I just have so much work to do (work that I should be doing now) and I just never seem to have time for it to all get done. I have to substitute not doing work for one class to get an essay done, I hate it. I don't like doing poorly nor do I like staying up late to complete work. I am cranky, grumpy, annoyed, and furious and SLEEPY. I am moving in with Chris on Sunday and let's hope that works out, he has assured me it will, but those are just words, not actions. I'm nervous and a lot of other stuff I don't know how to explain so it will make sense. Also, I know I'm a good writer (not obviously reflected here), I'm not the best writer nor am I the best at grammar, but I can write and I am fully confidant in my ability and no self absorbed new PHD fake teacher is going to tell me otherwise. I know how to write, I don't know how to write so it pleases her or according to her idol, Cioffi, but I DON'T CARE ABOUT CIOFFI. His laws of writing aren't that grand nor are they the law. I'm frustrated with English, it is almost making me hate my most beloved subject. I love 301 because my teacher is open, encouraging, interesting, and helpful. If she doesn't agree with me, I don't automatically get a D. I'm frustrated and stressed out and I don't know how to relieve my feelings. I also haven't talked to Chris all day because he was sick today and I called him, but he didn't answer so now I am worried that he's like really sick or something. I just don't know what say to please people anymore. I don't know how to act to please people. I want to scream and cry and neither of those are productive or fulfilling. I just want to say fuck everything and become a depressed hermit who reads constantly and writes neurotically. Is that what I am fated to be? I know I have anti-social tendances, but who doesn't? I am making friends at school god dammit! What's wrong with me? Have I just been too much by myself in my apartment?"

"event","It really bothers me that someone has to call you at work, at home, AND talk to you online. What is so important? And for you not to answer the phone when I'm there because you know it's her? I'm concerned because why am I moving in? So you can be secretive? Won't I interrupt your time with her? It bothers me because I don't want to hear about her nor do I care in any possible way. I don't care if she's online, we met online so anything can happen online. What interest do you have with a 30-40 old woman with 3 kids who doesn't do much with her day since she has the time to talk to you all day online and call you? Do you think I'm stupid? And the fact that you won't come to my apartment EVER really pisses me off. There is nothing wrong with my apartment and it being 'too small' is a load of shit. We don't live that far apart, and I don't think it's fair I ALWAYS have to go to your apartment. And when you are here, it's like you don't want to be here. So I don't see how moving in together is going to help anything, really. I think I need to think about it more because if you didn't want me to move in when I moved to MD, why now? Because you have no roommates? I still have 3 months until my lease is up here and I'd rather spend them here. 
I feel like I'm the only person who has to compromise and nothing changes for you. And how can I talk about any of this when you when you don't respond or just attack me with being nosey and jealous of w which, I'm neither. I'm concerned because I'm moving in and that's a big change for me and for you and it's time consuming so I don't want to waste my time or money on this when I have concerns that I can't even talk about with you. I don't care that you talk to people online, I get concerned when it crosses the line of interfering with OUR relationship. I think I'd rather look for another apartment to move into.... because I can't move into a place where I have doubts. I do want to move in a lot, but not until we talk about these things."

5. Beatles or Stones?

6. If you had to pick one person on earth who should die, who would it be?

7. The person whose problems you would never want to hear again?
Well this girl does complain about this boy who is not even her boyfriend to me QUITE a lot and numerous other problems that I really have heard way too much about. She complains 100 times more than any human I know.

No. 

10. If you could have any super power what would it be?
To read people's minds because I'm nosey sometimes.

12. How many drinks does it take to get you drunk?
HEH, well I am not sure, quite a lot according to my 21st birthday. It is not wise to mix so many types of liquor with so many types of beer. It causes masses amounts of vomiting on cars, bathtubs, oneself and the highway. :X

13. Favorite song lyric?
Waaaaaay too many. But here is one. ""In my platforms I hit the floor, fell face down didn't help my brain out, then my baby came before i found, the magic hell to keep her happy, I never was the fantasy of what you wanted me to be""

14. Hair color you most like someone you're dating to have?
none really, although I never had a real attraction to blonde people except for now, haha.

What an awful question. Seeing as how I was born with horrible vision and still have horrible vision, I'd rather be deaf.

I don't believe so.

17. Siblings that should go to rehab?
My brother I presume although it doesn't work.

Hmm, I can't say I enjoy July because it is far too hot and drags by. I don't like January either.

I think I don't know. Little mermaid? The Land Before Time? Ferngully? I have no idea.

I have lots of favorites so I shall list, my dad, mommy (at times), Chris, Emily, Mary, Beth, and my brother at times. 

21. When's the last time you went on a date?
Hm, I think Chris and I went out to dinner not too long ago, but I don't think it's really a date when you already date them, but I guess it is. 

22. Do you like violent movies or dirty movies?
Depends on how violent and how dirty, I suppose I enjoy the dirtiness in a movie, but porn is funny so I'm not talking about porn. 

23. Fall or spring?
Fall

24. Person you most wish you hadn't made out with?
Well I believe there are lots and the people I can't remember the names of should be in this list and to an extent Matt because well yeah and I'll shut up. 

25. If you are straight, what person of the same sex would you do it with?
Well none of the girls on my campus are particuarly enjoyable so that would leave them out although I do see a few who are cute.  

26. Where do you want to live when you are old and brittle?
The beach (not FL) or in the country or a mix of the two if that's possible. 

27. Who is the person or persons you can count on the most?
My dad, mom, Chris, Beth, Emily, Mary (I can't just name one)

28. If you could date any celebrity past or present, time and age who would it be?
Even though he used digusting heroin I'd have to say Brad Nowell of Sublime because I thought he was hot and wrote good music and also Ewan McGregor although he's a cheating bastard. 

29. What books have you pretended you've read?
Wow, a lot. Some Bronte book for Brit Lit, Cabeza De Vaca is the most recent. 

30. What's a word you would use to describe your life?
Mundane at times, but I like it. Enjoyable. 

31. Favorite drinking game?
I just like to drink in general, I don't need games. 

32. What did you dream last night?
That's so funny because I had three seperate WEIRD dreams that all awoke me and made me wonder if they were true. Firstly, I serious was pregnant and was about to give birth, like I was in the hospital and I was in that stupid hospital gown and yeah, it was super creepy and scary. Secondly, I was in California (dunno how I was there because I've never even seen California) and randomly found Chris with some random chick. Yeah that was so not okay. Thirdly, America was in a true war and I mean like on American soil (and I don't know at war with whom either) and it was craziness and people were trying to flee the country and my boss at work was trying to go back to India (cause that is where she is from) and I knew she wasn't ever going to come back and something bad was going to happen so I got upset because I really like my boss and yeah then I woke up due to the stupid alarm. CRAZY dreams I tell you! I did not enjoy any of them! And no, I don't think those dreams are foreshadowing anything. 

I just felt like doing that random quiz because I finished both of my essays ahead of time, I feel so accomplished. I'll write more stuff later, big news: moving in with chris soon, like Oct. I'm excited in ways, but nervous and having doubts in others. I'll make a real journal entry sometime soon."

"event","I'm only leaving for 4 days, but still could you show a little more then a kiss  and an i love you? A kiss someone would give to a stranger is what it felt like. I haven't felt shit from you in the past couple of weeks. And no, I don't want to know what your ex- g/f looks like, I really don't so don't fucking bring it up again. Shouldn't Saturday have given you a hint? ""I don't want to do this anymore"" aka, SHOW SOME FUCKING EMOTION FOR ME. I do love you and I do want to continue the relationship, but could you at least....I don't know, I give up. 

I don't want to feel like a stranger that you don't know. Love doesn't mean sex, I mean it is certainly a part of things, but I want you to actually feel something for me. I don't feel like you want to do anything with me, ever. How are we going to move in together, when I feel like I'm not wanted? Should we just pass each other in the hallway like we don't know each other? Sleep in seperate rooms? Go out seperatly?  Fuck other people? 
Tell me. I don't want to fuck other people and I want to live with you, but I don't like being ignored. 

Maybe it's me because I just feel this way right now or the past couple of weeks because I've been sick, but I don't think so, I'm not crazy nor needy, I just want some kind of feeling that you want me. Am I just someone to move in with you because you don't have a roomate? I shouldn't have to feel this way, we've been going out for a year and a half, it's not like I just met you. I shouldn't have to want you to call this weekend, I should just know you will to see how things are, but to know  you won't ahead of time at least  prepares me. I shouldn't have to think that way.  Writing in this stupid journal doesn't even begin to express what I actually think or feel, I just don't have the words to explain it. 
Unwanted and passed over. Just show me something....surprise me, make me think I'm wrong."

"event","It's been just about a year since my dad said he wanted a divorce from my mom. I hate everything about the month of August. I still dont understand it and I never will. Why my life had to be uprooted and broken apart and then I think about all the shit I had to go through from Aug-Jan with my mom and my brother and how I never wanted to hurt them with the way I felt. I still will never feel right about the situation and every time I see my mom I think about it and I never want to bring it up because I dont want to hurt her in any way. It upsets me too much to see her or my brother cry. What can I do though? Sit here and write about it and cry which never solves anything. I can't talk to my dad about because he's the reason everything happened in the first place. I still like my dad, but theres always that part of me that he hurt and it just cannot be fixed. It just, I don't know how to express what I want to say. Too many bad memories of this month and the months following August. Perhaps I am too sensitive as my dad always tells me, but why would he ever be hurt by this situation? The most unsympathetic... tells someone to stop crying, how? It just hasn't been the same between him and I since. I guess it isn't a big deal though right? Parents divorce left and right these days, so why let it matter? Why does is it such a big deal to me? Because I had no control over the matter and was completly helpless and watched everything crumble in front of me. So why let that matter now? Why now that I live an hour away, why let it be the focus of my attention? Because I can't erase my memories."

"event","So remember how I posted that post about him not spending the night at my house? Well, on Saturday, he was stupidly drunk and was like 'want to spend the night at my house?' I should have said no because I was mad at him, but I knew we had to go to my dad's in the morning and I was without car so I felt bad from him having to drive to come pick me up again. So then, we start watching a movie or some shit and he falls asleep! It's like 8:30 and what the fuck am I supposed to do? I don't particularly feel like watching the rest of whatever we were watching and I wasn't tired. Before he fell asleep I was sitting on his bed and he started touching my back and stuff and there wasn't any way I was going to have sex or proceed to touch him. I was furious. Fuck that. You don't invite your girlfriend over (especially since I NEVER spend the night at his house) and then fucking expect sex when I'm mad, and then fall asleep. So anyway, I didn't go to sleep until about 1:30 and woke up a lot and finally at 9 I was said fuck it and got up and showered. When he woke up, he said 'you didn't sleep well did you?"" No shit. How observant. So, I kicked myself for spending the night at his house. Usually, before I moved here, I'd spend the night at his house quite a few times a week or some such, but now I never do. I think the only reason he offered was 1) he was drunk and 2) he didn't want to drive to pick me up again. Well, I am not asking him to spend the night here anymore so I guess that solves that problem. That just annoys me greatly. The whole issue in general. Well I have my car again so I guess I won't be in that situation. 

I start new job July 5, which is nice, a bit nervous, but whatever. It is better then this white trash shit hole job. I quit Saturday, I am telling them tomorrow, I don't really care about 2 weeks notice. I hate that job so if I happen to go psycho tomorrow or another day I'm working this week, then it happens. I hope no one pisses me off  then :) Fucking white trash ignorant waste of human life people who shouldn't be allowed to breed. THAT's how much I hate my current job that I am quitting. So thankfully I am quitting. Perhaps it will raise my spirits. Also, I won't have to work weekends at my new job (YAY) so that will be quite nice. 9-6 every weekday, which I will have to get used to. At least it will be 40 hours. I need $$. I need to move to more of the ghetto to get cheaper rent. I refuse to get a roommate. I'm too damn selfish and I like my space and privacy. I thought about how I'd like Chris as my roommate (or something?), but I just don't think that would work now, even if he wanted to, which he does not. I'm too used to living on my own. Also, it hurt when he said he didn't want any roommates when I moved here (i.e. me) and then acquired not just one roommate, TWO. What a feeling of rejection, but it's not a first. I know I want to look for a cheap town house for my next home in like Nov I'll start looking, but I don't know if I could live in a town house all by myself. If I lived in a town house, I'd like him to move in too :\ I mean it'd be a big enough space cause an apartment is tiny for multiple people. I won't bring up the issue though because who would want to give up living with their 2 best friends to live with their girlfriend? It's like having everything one ever wants (aside from ass, but one can live without) all in one place. I don't know. I won't ever say anything though.  I think I've written too much for today though. No more updating for a while."

"event","So I remarked to Chris the other night how he has never spent the night in my home since I moved here and he just said ""I know"" and that was it. No explanation no nothing. I don't spend the night at his house anymore either. When he didn't even try to make an excuse that hurt my feelings because couldn't he have at least tried? We haven't talked about it since so I guess I'll stop bringing it up (this is like the 10th time I've brought it up). I guess he never will. Matt put it aptly when he said ""So, he just fucks you and leaves"". Well, when you think about it, yes I guess that is true. It kind of saddens me to come to that realization, but it's true, isn't it? It's something that I can't stop thinking about and when he comes over to my house (which is rare mind you) I think about that and of course him never spending the night. Not even when I have a Sunday off (which is rare, too, but it does happen). It's not like I have to get up that early on a Sunday! Or he could just leave for work on the weekday from my house... I give up, I'm never asking again, ever. And that [joking] comment about me moving into his place, yeah right. I give up on that too. My life will be the book plot of the book I just finished except it will not have the happy ending. I'm not saying I am not happy, just things must progress not excessively fast just I do not know. It is hard to explain what exactly I mean. I love him and he loves me [or so he says] so that will be it for like years and nothing will ever happen except I'll graduate and still be in the same exact place I was. It depresses me. I don't want BIG changes here, just something to know that this isn't for nothing, that security I guess you could call it. I think I have complained enough. On that note, I don't really talk to Matt anymore either. I have no desire to. Nothing will ever amount to anything with him, so there really isn't a point."

"event","Since everyone else is updating, I might as well too. I have a very nice job interview yesterday at this private school. I could perhaps be a teachers assistant since I don't have my damn certifications yet which would be nice. I would work most of the week (if not all) which means......I could quit my white trash job and not have to work the weekends!!! That would be wonderful. However. I have a 2nd interview Tuesday morning to see if I play well with the children (it's only 30mins, shouldn't be that bad) If she likes me then, then I should be offered a position. In other news, I should have money sometime in the next few weeks since my dad is paying for my car payment! Which means I might be able to actually 1) go out and 2) pay of my damn evil cc. Onward. I need to call Mary back because she called me yesterday and I was interviewing. I worry about her :\ 

So since Emily and I decided that I need to have a party here and July is coming up (sort of), I figure it should be near the end of July so I can retain some type of financial standing. Mary, Sam, Emily, must come and if you'd like bring others! Not too many though seeing how my apartment isn't that big. 

So I realized that I need to go to the beach this summer because I want to go swimming and get sunburnt and just generally be away from Baltimore. I don't know when exactly I'll get to go, if I do because I need to work like crazy so I don't have to work that much in the fall. I must get a 3.0 gpa in the fall or else I will not get accepted into the EDU program here. I need to propose to Chris that he and I go to the beach in August sometime. It will be a nice vacation. On that note, things with him are fine since some people have been asking how things are going. Well as far as I know. We hang out usually as much as possible since I always work on the silly weekends. Although last week I was in bit of a grumpy mood just because. No real reason, but I was just grumpy. Last weekend was filled with painting at my dad's house which included me to be rather grumpy. Just one of those weeks I suppose. Much better this week though. The job thing has made me hopeful and the potential to actually have funds! My mom, aunt, and grandmother are coming to see me on the 26 and we're hanging out for a little while which should be okay. July 3rd I need off from work too (haha, they are starting to hate me) because I have to go to Chris's mom's. Sunday's are just no good for me. I always have something to do on Sunday and especially since my dad wants his house painted, I need time off too. I was planning on taking this Saturday off to paint, but I can't cause I need the money to pay for my car, sucks cause I enjoyed having a Saturday off. At least I get off at 5:30 on Saturday. *Sigh* I've been a huge bum today and done nothing except read. I don't have to work until 5:30 so I really don't have much to do. I need to vacuum, but I broke it and cannot fix it :\ It looks pretty damn gross in here due to their being cat fur everywhere. I can't help it! Perhaps I should go shower seeing how I haven't even done that. That's enough updating for now.

Of course my first response wanted to be of course, but then I said something I forgot what. Secretly, I think it'd be nice to live together. It'd cheaper for the both of us for one and I think it'd be cool. So when he said that, I was happy on the inside, but I didn't say anything else about it. I don't want him to think that I want to move in with him cause I know he doesn't want that yet or ever? Anyway, I'll write more later, I am tired and need to shower. We're painting again tomorrow rather, he is, he did like all the work, haha.

It was quite an enjoyable trip I must say. I missed seeing my friends from Shepherd. I told Emily she should move in with me. That would rock. She also mentioned we should have a party and yes, I should! I think it will be in July sometime when work isn't mad at me for taking off so many damn days. MARY and SAM MUST come since they seem to not want to go anywhere. Anyway, I'll plan that out later. 

I do not believe I got the job at Kindercare because I called today, and I spoke with another woman and she said they do not need anyone right now so that sucks ass. I have an interview at a school next Weds which I do not believe I am qualified for because I do not have training/experience/certifications. We'll see though. I just need a second job and this school would be a job into the fall so that means I could quit the white trash job. My luck has not been so great lately with jobs and I am a pessimist so I always look at the poor sides of situations. I cannot help it. 

I talked to my father last night about my financial situation and I told him how I felt bad for asking him for money each money and he told me he expects it because I go to school and work a shitty job (those were my words). I told him I still felt bad and that I should not have to do that every month and expressed how it isn't like I go out every night and squander all of my money. He knew this and just said even though one works all the time, it is still very plausible to come out with zero dollars after paying most of the bills. I still don't understand it and I never will. He said he was proud of me for understanding the value of a dollar and working for what I have, but that doesn't help me pay for any of my bills. Every month I think my car payment is going to be late, because I usually cannot pay it until the day of or the day before it is due. I don't entirely know what would happen, except I would have to pay the $10 late fee and probably get a nasty letter. If I just didn't pay it one month though, it would fault my credit and I'm sure I'd see the repo man to take it away. I would cry of course, but that'd be $230.22 I'd have to pay for other things. Then I would not have a way to work of course, so I guess I should probably just pay for the god damn thing. 

I'm a bit depressed about not getting that job at Kindercare. The job search continues... 

So about this Matt person. I talk to him almost every evening for quite a long time. He still wants to hang out, but what exactly sure? I told him we could just watch a movie or whatever, but I'm still sketched out to hang out with boys who become friends since the last time I did that, the person assumed we'd have sex. Do I have the word 'easy' written on my forehead? I don't want comments on that because I don't want to hear it. Certain circumstances make some cases an exception to that rule. ANYWAY, he's quite nice enough because haha, I've hung out with him when I was like 19 or something. 

I took pictures from the Shepherd hanging out of Matt and Sam, but have not put them on my computer yet. Of course stupid me forgot to take a picture of Emily though. I will next time I see her. I don't have much else to update though. I guess I will go back to reading. 

I talked to Bobby this afternoon. Small talk I guess you could call it."

We just talk about mindless things, just what each of us has been up to.  Just a friend. Then, this dude that Mary and I know, Dave contacted me on AIM. I haven't talked to him in a while either, he is in D.C. now which isn't a surprise. He's a little odd, quiet, but nice enough when I hung out with him. I just remember how silent he was when we went to Renn. Fest. I mean quiet is okay, but when placed in that type of situation, talking is nice. Anyway, he wants to hang out sometime and just have a drink or whatever, but since what happened to Mary at his place, I don't know if I feel comfortable hanging out with him. I mean he didn't actually do anything, but he didn't stop his friend.  Sigh. Also, I'd feel weird hanging out with him by myself. I wouldn't exactly invite Chris though, that'd just be weird. I don't know, I'll have to think about if I'll hang out with him. Why are all these people I used to know contacting me!? I mean Matt, is cool, I like talking to him, but I used to like him, so that's kind of weird. 

Oh, I love Audioslave now. I want their new album. This ipod that I got for my bday is awesome. It is a very nifty invention. I can just continuously listen to music and put whatever I want on it and I can listen to it in the car. It's so neat. Anyway, I don't know how I did in school yet, since school is so damn slow at posting grades. I think though, I got a B in Spanish, a B in Amer. Lit, a C in British Lit, and a stupid ass D in Art History because my teacher is a Nazi who hates me. It's true! She's an old mean German lady, not to say that German's are Nazi's cause I'm German, but she's really mean! Anyway, I didn't think I did THAT poorly in her class, but I believe I did. I hopefully won't get an F, that would just be super harsh. That job situation is still as it was last time, shitty and awful. I am going to call Kindercare tomorrow to see if they still want me. I sure as hell hope so. I hate my white trash job and I hate working Saturdays. Humans shouldn't be forced to work Saturdays. Everything should be closed. Fuck Sunday be a spiritual day, I don't mind working Sunday's, things close early, but Saturday? It's evil. So next weekend, I am going to weasel my way out of working since I have to help paint the interior of my dad's house. I don't really care what response they give me, I am not coming in those days. Fuck them :) The pay is shitty and the people are shitty, why would I want to work there? I have to continue to work there until I find a new job though. Also, I work all the days Chris does not, so of course that is shitty too. Also, I can barely pay my bills (infact I can't really) since I don't make enough money there and they won't give me more hours. I don't think even if I worked 40 hours I'd have enough money to pay my bills. No, I would not. Isn't that sad? I just calculated it, I would need much more. 40 hours a week times 7.25 = 290 minus taxes, so like 200 bucks. That doesn't even pay my car payment! It'd only be like 60 more bucks than what I get now and frankly, working there for 40 hours isn't worth it. Enough work complaining. 

What else? I talk to Emily today for a long time and I most enjoyed it. I miss her a lot and I miss being able to walk across the street (campus, whatever) to see her and chill out. I wanna have sushi with her again and just spend the night talking. Hopefully when I have some extra cash I can make a trip to Shepherdstown. Perhaps my dad will go to, so he can drive and pay for gas, hah! I bet I can get him to do that. I will make a point of it to see Emily and Mary too, if she's around. I haven't spoken to her in a while due to I am horrible with phones and never around. I need to give her a call tomorrow on her cell. She always calls when I'm at work! I can't help it. I have to slave away so I can live in this crap apartment. Perhaps sometime in July I can visit Shepstown and we could go shopping. Yes, I'd like that. I think monthly vacations to visit friends is healthy. This month I must visit Beth and Meagan if it kills me. I MUST see Richmond (not that Richmond is all that pretty), but I miss it. I was going to move there so I do feel semi attached to it. It isn't that far of a drive, 2 hours or so. I will do it. Too bad work is going to get mad at me for taking off work, oh well. Hire more people you retards. 

I am still irked why Dave wants to hang out. We were just friends and I did have a slight crush on him when we first started hanging out, but I came to my senses. Perhaps he needs companionship, which I can understand. I just don't know if I want to venture to D.C., because I don't like going on the metro at night by myself. I'm stupid, but oh well. I don't even like walking at night from my car to my doorstep! I'm just scared of the dark. 

Anyway, I have gotten used to this 'I love you' phrase. I like it, a lot. It makes me happy, not the phrase of course, but the meaning behind the phrase. I am sure that is cliche, but I don't really care. It makes me happy and I need happiness to keep me from strangling people. I like Chris a lot and since I knew I loved him in December of last year, it just makes me more gleeful. I think though, that him and I need a vacation. I think we should go camping or like rent a cabin (always makes me think of that movie Cabin Fever or worse, TX Chainsaw Massacre) near a lake and semi-camp out. I think it would be a lot of fun. I think it'd be cheaper than the beach and a little less touristy. I am sure MD has some type of cabin or some such. If not, the northeast I suppose it is, like Conn. and such has nice nature places. It's a drive, but pretty. I want to take lots of pictures because I have like no pictures. I have only half of the Puerto Rico pictures cause my mom can't find her camera. I will find it eventually and get them so I can print them. I just like to take pictures. I miss taking photography, I should have minored in it. It is all so digitized now and I hate digital photo, not saying that people who do it are fake photographers, but in a way, yes they are. I like black and white photography, developing my own film and prints. Printing them until I think they are perfect and not too grey or dusty. It's a process, a tedious one sometimes and def. expensive, but worthwhile. I love my photos and I don't care if others do. I want to more with the whole writing on the body thing since I only have a male (Bobby) and I wanted to do a female too. I also wanted to do male and female portrait shots, together and separate. Perhaps I'll use Emily as a model and steal Shepherds photo lab. I don't know if I can use the one at school since I am not a photo major. I am going to make it a point to take a photo class at UMBC, even though it will have to be photo 101, which will kill me because I know how to do that shit and I don't want to take pictures that have a theme that the teacher picks. I have my own themes and ideas. Perhaps I can weasel myself into a higher level one. I can provide examples of work. I'll think about that. Or perhaps a community college will have a photo workshop or something for cheap and I can attend. My friend Shannon wants to do this pottery class, and I don't know, I am not very good with clay, I never was. I am not creative in that aspect. Although, it would be neat to make some bowls and plates. I'll look into that too. 

I think I have complained and mindlessly ranted for one night. Overall, things are okay I suppose. I just don't like the feeling that I don't have the money to pay my bills, it makes me feel insecure and stupid. I don't like that feeling. But what can I do? Sell my body to random strangers? I don't think I'd make any  money that way, but perhaps...hahaha. Some days are better than others I suppose. I am going to try and finish The Fountainhead tonight. I wish I could discuss it with Bobby because there are so many things that I want to know about that book and how much I enjoyed it truly. We parted though due to his condition and that hurts me a lot and I know I shouldn't message him because it would just be painful for the both of us. I don't know, whenever I read that book or look at the others I have by her, it makes me think of him and how many good discussions we had about the concepts and philosophies in that book and surrounding life in general. That is when he was normal and himself and that is what I miss about him. He was so honest during those discussions and we could talk about anything and it was just so, freeing. That isn't a very good word for it, but it will do. I miss him terribly, not in a boyfriend way anymore, but as a really good friend. He was my best friend too. Perhaps I'll just write down all my ideas that I have about the book and somehow con him into letting me send him a letter even if he doesn't respond. I IM'd him, so let's see if he'll respond, I highly doubt it, but I had to. He's just someone I'll never forget. It's so sad he won't take his medication though, he could be semi-normal, but he won't. I always knew how stubborn he was about medication. I guess it is for his own good though. He's an absolute nut now, not that he wasn't when he was staying with me. Christ, I hadn't cried so much from one person in my whole life. So defeating, but it made me stronger in the end. Made me learn a lot of things too. Anyway, that is ENOUGH. No more writing."

"event","I was reading some of my earlier posts, like from 2003 and really, was I that stupid? Why didn't any of MY FRIENDS tell me I was stupid? Perhaps it was post-bobby relationship issues that made me so fucking stupid? I really don't know, but please, if i EVER act like that again, stop me. I think I am more sensible now and grown up (not much, heh) than I was a couple of years ago. When I look back on it, it wasn't that fun at all. I think I realized a lot of things about myself that I did not enjoy and I learned just how evil people are. Well, I learned that with Bobby, but people in general. I also realized I hurt many people too and that was never my intention, I never want to hurt people, so I am sorry. 

Aside from that random tangent, school is almost over. I have my very last satan like final on Monday. It will be my hardest too, art history sucks so much. I will get a D and I am most certain of it. Isn't that shitty? I tried really hard in that class too. Damn old German professor. She hates me because of my German decent, I swear. Aside from that, I think I should be okay on grades. I have my Amer. Lit final tomorrow and quite frankly I am not all that worried. I did all the readings aside from one I have to finish tonight and understood them for the most part. I need to go over some of the poetry concepts so I can explain them further and such, but I think I am okay for that one. I didn't study like at all for the mid-term and I got an A. British Lit I am getting straight C's, which sucks but at least it is a C. I guess I just do not excel in that class. My course load for the fall is rather hefty so that means less working which means I'll be a happier person :) I uh, hate work. I know I have mentioned that numerous times, but no place is hiring. I will just be stuck with my white trash job. Well, it isn't a white trash job per se, just the area it is located and the people that frequent the store are white trash. Moving on though, what have I done recently? Nothing. A whole lot of working and a whole lot of school and nothing else really. 

My birthday was fantastic in every way aside from the puking. I took 4 days off of work and experienced the true 21 of getting completely drunk and successfully puking just about everywhere aside from the bed. At least I didn't get the bed..haha. I woke up the next morning extremely tired, ill, and confused. At least I was in bed with someone I knew (haha). Chris didn't seem to excited by me that day, but he knew it was going to happen! I came out with some pretty awesome presents too which is neat. 

So, what else? No deep internal thoughts this post unless I feel so inclined. 

I do feel a bit lonely at times I must admit. Living by oneself is awesome in every which way, but I do get lonely. I miss my friends and parents a lot too. I cannot spend every waking moment with Chris and sometimes the friends I do have here cannot hang out so I am left to myself (which is good in its own way), but sometimes I need social contact at that very moment in time. Sometimes I feel like he doesn't want to hang out either or talk to me as much anymore which does sadden me. On Saturday night, we babysat his nephew and I asked if he wanted to come to my house afterwards and he said no, because he didn't want to drive home and then asked if I wanted to come to his house and I said now for the exact same reason. Then he said fine, we can just go to each of our houses. That sort of hurt in it's own way. Then he said well, I guess you can leave now. I am not sure he realized that it hurt when he said that. It was just the way it was phrased and the tone in which is came out. I had no reply so of course I left and I wasn't going to cry, but I felt saddened. I believe I am unable to cry at such matters now where before it just came so easily. I just feel too defeated so I gave him a meaningless hug and left. How nice huh? I felt like shit driving home. Then to increase the matter, I got lost on the way out of the neighborhood because it was semi-raining and foggy. I did get home, just took me a little while. I was not pleased when I got home. Did I talk to him about this? No, I am never good at such things. Perhaps I just make small matters into large ones, but if it obviously mattered enough for me to get upset about it, it matters. Take notice to that sometimes your words and phrases do hurt, even though you may not think so. You've done the same thing several times and maybe that is why it hurt this time. Also, sometimes I feel like we are growing apart in a slight way and I don't like that. I want that uninterrupted time WITHOUT roommates, onlookers, with just YOU. Or to go out to a place with just YOU. How many times much I emphasize that? Is there something wrong with jut going to a place with just ME? Maybe I am just unaware of something.... ;( Then other times I feel like we've connected greatly and it makes me happy. You still make me happy and I love everything, but time alone with just us is so very meaningful than one will ever know. We don't even have to talk that much because sometimes we are just silent people so it works. 

Lies of omission are hurtful. Remember that. Not calling when we have not spoken in a while is hurtful too. At least to see how things are. I won't think it weird, I will like it because it will be unexpected. But sometimes anticipation is key and essential in certain situations. 

You cannot have everything your way. You already live with your two bestfriends, am I just interfering? Sometimes it feels that way, like I don't want to interrupt. Think about which means more. Not saying you have to choose, but just think before you invite and what you say. Think. 

Then I think, what am I in Maryland for? For school yes, but really, what am I in Maryland for? I sacrificed living in a superior state to settle for rudeness, stupidity, white trashness, ghetto old apartments, more expensive, loneliness, feeling stupid, tears, being scared, to find things on my own.... through all of these things even though sometimes I do feel internally so lonely and unaware and naive. Lately, I don't feel like I know everything, just living to work and pay mindless corporations and dragging myself to class to take incoherent notes and talk to friends in class and forget about them when I return home and bundle up myself in my own thoughts and reminisce on the time when I did feel extremely happy and was content in life and now, I feel lost again- out of place, not in my element, but yours, but an interruption in your element. Not able to make my own space within space. Loneliness does not begin to describe the internal emotion, only internal, not external because I must hide mine to help others and to be strong and not breakdown, like last time where no one knew what it was like to hide every emotional sign to put on a facade of happiness and strength. Why not let someone know? How and what would I gain? I cannot process my thoughts into verbal words where someone could listen and analyze or advise. Too jumbled, too dyslexic to try and communicate verbally with someone whom I could trust to understand. It is unfathomable as to what my mind produces in reference to emotions. Though I am not complaining, I am only stating because I do not actually want advice or a listener, just a technological way to write my thoughts which is what this serves. The 'lonely' emotion box that one can click does not begin to describe the feeling. Live journal lacks the words I feel - grey and empty.

"event","I don't think guys realize how simple affection is so imortant sometimes. It can say so much more than they realize. Just a simple kiss or a hug can brighten a day, at least mine. Or laying in bed without saying anything just sort of half way holding each other means more to me than you'd ever realize. I just like spending uninterupted time with you, without your roomates and not always at my place. I miss your place too. I mean that is where everything happened for a good portion of our relationship. It was nice tonight and I got my sloppy, wet kisses back ;) I suppose I need affection (like any natural person) more than you or guys in general. You seem quite content and I enjoy that. I liked laying on your chest and hearing your heart beat so quickly and beat quicker when I softly touched your stomach. Anticipation is key. I enjoy how slow you go sometimes and fast you go at others. I like seeing your arms flex and your breath get heavy on my neck. I also like how I can control you too and feel your hands on my back. I like it when you kiss my neck too it makes me want everything more. I like it all. I love the attention of course. I like holding hands with you because your hands are bigger than mine. I like how you are so considerate of my feelings and always ask me how I feel about the situation or if I have an opinion. I am not used to that. You always think about me in the situations and if I am unable to go then I tell you to go, but you always say you'd rather spend time with me. I smile internally knowing that I'd be happy spending time anywhere with you. Sounds sad huh? It is true though. I have reached a point (and this does not have anything to do with moving because I knew this long before I moved to MD) that I think...I love you. 

I don't know how to say that to you, in person and I know you don't read this so I can just ramble on about it for as long as I please. It sounds so stupid, but how can I repress what I feel? It has always been hard for me to explain what I feel especially for others, but just in general because I do not enjoy expressing emotion and I can say it, on here, but never verbally. I've only said it to one other person and I did mean it, at the time and I thought he did too. Infact, I have it on paper in a letter he wrote me, but that means nothing now. I realize how truely fucked up that relationship was. Aside from that random tangent, I am well, I think. I feel a bit lonely at times, for no apparent reason though so no need to worry.  

I could have said it tonight when I got my sloppy, wet kisses, but no I walked away and got my things. I would feel too rejected and hurt if you said nothing or did not hear me. What would your reply be? Your honest reply? I need to know, in time. 

I think I am falling too hard, but not too fast, just too hard. I would cry for days. It would effect me although I would try not to show it. I do not know what else to say. Just lately, I have been thinking about all of this - the relationship, where is it going? Lots of adventures apparently, but again, I need that human affection and assurance because it makes ME feel good. 

I like the way your hands do not fumble, they are steady and firm. You are not afraid to touch or be touched. You squirm, but only in anticipation - which grows by breathing getting heavy and faster movements of my hands, softly running along your stomach and the top of your pants. You, waiting to see what I will do next. I cannot prove how much I want so quickly or else  you'll end quickly. Slowly start to undress you and I always like what I see, touch, taste. I always forget how much I enjoy you which makes each time better, longer, more intense. I feel everything. I am comfortable with you. 

I should not say anymore. I should sleep and just stop being so emotional? It is good though. Everything is fine. So much for an update."

"event","Last Thursday I ventured from my home to my other home, Reston to get onto a plane (I hate planes). As much as I dislike Reston, it was nice to see home and normal drivers. I curse everytime I have to drive in MD (which is often), they have to be the worst drivers (aside from NY or NY) I have witnessed. AWFUL. How can you live in a state and not know where the exits are on the beltway when you see them everyday? Why bother to turn if you are only going to go 10mph the rest of the way. Just walk. Anyway, I went to Puerto Rico to visit my godmother who lives there since she has to take care of her sick mother. I went with Chris (of course) and my mom and brother flew down seperately, but we all stayed in the same place, my god mother's house. Well, that was interesting. Overall, it was a nice vacation and I do miss the beaches and warmth very very much. I woke up this morning a bit confused because first off, there was no warm human next to me and it was cold. Shitty eh? I got used to waking up with Chris like every morning and then just going off to the beach. I must admit it is nice to be home though just because I get homesick. 

What I did: 
no homework 
ate lots of good food
drank lots, but was never too drunk
swam in the pretty ocean for long periods of time
got sunburnt
talked excessivly
went to the rain forest there and swam in a freshwater waterfall (the most awesome thing ever!)
and many many other things :P

I think Chris and I just sort of like had a nice communciation epiphany (it is very hard to explain, but it makes sense when I type it out to myself) because of a fight my brother and mom had which led to various events. We both cried (for the first time ever either of of has seen each other cry), and i apologized profusely, but I think it just opened up an understanding of what my family went through with the divorce and what he went through as well. It was a sad day, but a good one too because I think it made both of us just understand one another a little better. 

So, I was getting out of the shower one evening and went into the room with a mere towel and what does this lead to? Why a perfect opportunity to engage in illicit behavior. One would think so. As I was drying off which was supposed to lead to that moment, several knocks at the door. My god mother needed something in the room. Alright, one person cannot spoil the whole mood so things being to advance and what do you know, more knocks at the door! Well, now everyone has to come into the room and the mood is ruined. Needless to say, that sucked. Ruined a perfect opportuinty. However, it was later made up for :P 

I am now home in MD and it is cold and just reminds me of all of the homework I have to do *cough*spanish*cough* I have a good portion of a novel to read as well. At least Sunday is Easter and that means no work so I will have time to do homework/laundry/clean/etc. I do have to work tonight and tomorrow which is shitty, but it's money and I need to get my paychecks.

One nice thing I did get in the mail though was a refund check for my school loan since I over estimated and it was for a nice $1000. I was elated for a mere matter of seconds because I realized I have to pay off my CC and pay various over bills and when I calculated it all out, I think i was left with about a 100 bucks which is going into savings. My elation turned into sadness because I never seem to just have 'extra' money. I work a shitty job and still come out with nothing. Sigh. I also received a Comcast Cable bill which is due by tomorrow. I wish they would have sent that before I left. Fuckers. It will now be late because I do not believe my checks I deposited will clear in time to make the due date of tomorrow. Hopefully the check I mailed won't bounce. That has been my life in a nutshell for the past week.
I am still tired from the plane so I think I must sleep more before work. I like my job, but I miss working at Michaels so much. I liked Michaels so much more. AC Moore has some backwards policies and is rather unorganized nor do I enjoy working until 7 on Saturday's, I need to fix that. It is a job which I am thankful for, but I don't know, I don't enjoy it. Enough ranting. Must get more sleep with kitty!"

I can feel my face get hot, like when I have a fever and my eyes feel red and dry, yet warm tears litte my cheeks. I wipe them away quickly so i cannot see myself crying. I feel weak and ashamed. What did I do wrong to deserve such unkindness and lack of respect? I thought I deserved more, espcially from you. Of all the people I trusted and gave so much to, this is what I get? A slap in the face. I am nothing to you, just a tool you used to get material possessions from. You took from me, yet gave nothing in return except false hopes and pretenses. Your touch means nothing anymore. Just a filthy hand grazing my skin. 



so yeah, can't you tell I am so thrilled? I thought i'd update with something more pleasant, but that is all that comes out. It's a long story if you ask, and I don't particulary feel like sharing. Perhaps I am just paranoid, but perhaps not. My instincts are usually pretty sound. Sucks for me huh? I moved all this way and wasted everything to live in this shitty apartment by myself alone and tired. I love school, but it wasn't worth school. Am I just homesick? No, it is much deeper than that. 

A song by Ani Difranco sums up just about everything. 

""Done Wrong""

the wind is ruthless
the trees shake angry fingers at the sky
the people hunch their shoulders
hold their collars over their earsand run by
it's a cold rain
it's a hard rain
like the kind that you find in songs
i guess that makes methe jerk with the heartache
here to sing youabout how i've been done wrong

and i am sitting, watching
out the window of the coffee shop
and i am waiting, waiting
waiting for it to let up
i am rocking like a cradle
warming my hands with the cup in between
i am leaning over the table
holding my face over the steam

and before it gets so cold
that the rain turns to snow
there's just a couple things
i'd like to know

like how could you do nothing
and say, i'm doing my best
how could you take almost everything
and then come back for the rest
how could you beg me to stay,
reach out your hands and plead
and then pack up your eyes and run away
as soon as i agreed

it just all slips
away so slowly
you don't even notice till you've lost a lot
i've been like one of those zombies
in vegas
pouring quarters into a slot
and now i'm tired
and i am broke
and i feel stupid and i feel used
and i'm at the end of my little rope
and i am swinging back and forth
about you

before it gets so cold
that the rain turns to snow
there's just a couple things
i'd like to know

like how could you do nothing
and say, i'm doing my best
how could you take almost everything
and then come back for the rest
how could you beg me to stay,
reach out your hands and plead
and then pack up your eyes and run away
as soon as i agreed


Enjoy your fucking dismal life. I give up on trying."

"event","So I have moved, officially. I live right outside of Baltimore now. I live by myself with my kitty cat and I enjoy it a lot. I am paying out of state rates for the University of MD, Baltimore County, but I am happy, finally, at least I think so. Of course I miss my dad a lot, but it was time for me to try to be on my own. I am paying bills and all that crap which sucks of course, but that is life. I have not found a job yet, which has it's perks and shittiness. I have no money for one, but I have more time to do homework, which really means do nothing. I am turning my application in for Michaels (placed I worked in VA) tomorrow and they were hiring so hopefully they will hire me! School is rather hard, but I have to say I enjoy it. I like being at a University I enjoy now and I am actually doing things for my  major now. I haven't met many people, but a few. Literature majors usually aren't the most friendly people - usually pretty snooty. I dislike Spanish class just as I thought I would. I think I may have to get a tutor, already. I do not remember how to conjugate verbs, which is like super important. British Lit is not my favorite course and nor is the teacher. Amer Lit, is exactly like the Lit course I took at NOVA so it sucks because I've already read this material and I do not think the teacher is picking the best selection of authors from the time frame the class goes to. She chose Faulkner which I do agree is a good example, but she did not choose anything by Tennessee Williams which shocks me. Also, I felt her syllabus was extremely out of order and not divided properly. The whole idea of this time frame (I believe it is from 1885-1945) is regionalism (among other things) and I think she totally misses that point/purpose. It is a key element in understanding this time frame and that is why studying Faulkner is so important, but excluding Tennessee Williams? Lunacy. She picked Mark Twain's Huck Finn to read in it's entirety which is stupid because most people read that in high school so why make it a requirement for a 300 level course in college? I just question the organizational skills of this woman. She even said her syllabus was not in order according to authors which I think makes it more confusing because one has to jump around in a literature sense which different themes from different periods and it is hard to grasp a unifying concept, hence REGIONALISM. Okay, so that was a long tangent that was probably pretty useless, but I really needed to say that, it has been bugging me everytime I read the assignments. 

What else? Mary came up to visit me and that was fun. I enjoyed seeing her. 

Chris and I are fine and I think being closer to him is a plus. He comes over a few nights a week which is cool. We went to this super bowl party last night and that was fun, I guess. Too bad he was upstairs a lot of the time smoking.... oh well. I wasn't aware there was a rule to follow your boyfriend around the whole night a party, he informed me that I should have come upstairs with him. I was like, should have asked me to come... Oh well. There is one thing I do most enjoy and they are shallow things but who cares, they make me feel good.  I enjoy how I am introduced as his girlfriend, it makes me gleeful on the inside. Second, I enjoy being kissed and held in public, it makes me feel giddy as well. I did not think he was the type, especially infront of his friends. It just makes me feel gleeful and I don't know how to describe it really. It's stupid yes, but I don't really care. I think I like him more and more each day, and when he does something to piss me off, I guess it just subsides...or gets pushed down. Although we do talk more about things now that I am closer. We are going on a week long trip in March for my spring break which is neato. I think it will be nice and that will be a year since we've gone out, a nice gift. Valentines day is coming and I really could give a shit less. A useless holiday for companies to steal more money that I do not have. I feel as though we should spend the night together without all those mushy items and just have a nice night. I am not getting him anything, as far as I know and he isn't getting me anything as far as I know. On another note, I am glad I found a place by myself and not with Chris (not that we'd move in together or anything) because I like this 'space' that we both have. It is a good space too. I think at this stage, it is nice. This apartment isn't very large and neither is his so it is nice to just live by myself. It is hard to explain, but it's good. 

I think that is enough of an update for now. I will post more as more exciting things occur, which isn't probably too likely."

"event","Since I am extremely tired from work, it will be brief. The most important thing? I got into UMBC!!! (Uni. of MD, baltimore county). I am SO excited! They called me on Thurs to tell me I needed to sign up for orientation since I had been accepted :D So what does this mean? That means I move to MD in my very own apartment (nothing grand or large) near the campus (no campus living for me or roomates, thank god) and commute to school. I am super excited but also super nervous. Big school, own apartment, scary. But I think it will be a healthy move. Also, I'm closer to Chris :) I will have to find a new job which is all well and good because I told Michaels today I was leaving and they were sad and so was I :( I really do enjoy the people I work with. They said I can put them as references if I decide to work at the Michaels in Towson. I am thinking about it until I can find a higher paying job. I must get a loan very quickly so they can pay my tuition very quickly, can't do the loan till Monday cause the loan people are stupid and I must call them. My dad and mom are going to help with rent for a little while cause I need to get a job again and such. Anyway, I am going to look at ghetto apartments next week as Saturday is my last day at work *sniffles* :( Anyway, I must get some sleep as it is almost midnight I realize and I have to work again tomorrow. I will update more when I find my place and sign up for classes. I am such a nerd too because I found so many English/literature courses I want to take since they have so many. Most are full though so I will have to beg the professor to let me in. Wish me luck at orientation on Weds! (I hope they didn't make a mistake or something because I haven't even receieved a letter....) I am going to call them on Monday although they assured me I was accepted. 

Goodnight."

I suppose. 

Not much to report. New Year's Eve was okay, got drunk with Chris's friends and talked a lot. We seem to talk much more when we're both drunk, I wonder why? :P When we finally got back to his apartment I was sooo tired and all I wanted was some nice sleep time, but nooo, his stomach had to start feeling sick (not his fault!) so I was up at like 5 and 6am and finally at 7am I was like I'm going home. His sickness was not from the awful gross liquor he was drinking, I don't think, but probably from something he ate cause he had a fever and such. Thankfully, he's better now. Sunday I proceeded to do nothing over at his house because I didn't have to work which was a nice feeling. I do have to work today which blows. I'd rather be sleeping! Lazy. :) I have to work this weekend too which so sucks because my favooooorite cousin is coming up on the 7th to help my mom move.  Then I need to proceed to clean up our house massivly and move all my junk to the basement. A lot of cleaning is going to have to be done to make this house look livable again. I shall help my mom move as much as possible, but she is not getting help for her mental issues and apparently I'm to blame as much as my dad because I always take my dad's side, which is not true. I took her to the doctors countless times and I have tried to help her, but she throws it back in everyone's face. She told me last night she was not continuing therapy which I think is a horrible idea. Her therapist will only let her come back to her practice if she brings a family member with her to the sessions because my mom has been lying to everyone about what her therapist tells her. My mom came home last week saying she was cured, what a load of shit. My therapist told my dad yesterday that she never said that and she encouraged my mom to seek an out patient group therapy, my mom failed to mention that. She then told us her therapist was lying. Heh, somehow I don't believe that. So to make a long story short, I do not feel comfortable going with her to the therapist and she will not ask her sister who lives 30mins from us to go either. She told us she doesn't want anyone to know her business, how stupid! It is out business because we've tried to help her. Her sister from WV came up for the weekend and she was obnoxious towards her and her mother. They are coming up again this weekend to help her move and we'll see what kind of stunts she pulls this weekend. So I don't know what to tell her, or do for her. I told her to take her sister who lives here, but she won't. I just cannot sit there and listen to her talk about whatever she talks about (apparently she lies a lot) and also my schedule is so crazy so it'd be hard for her to make an appointment around. 

Enough ranting. I have to get ready for work. Perhaps I will feel the need to update more often. 

Emily- I haven't talked to you in ages! I miss you! I hope everything is well :)

Mary- I'm talking to you actually as I post and you know I miss you too! 

Hope to see you both soon and to meet your friend who lives in Manassas, Mary. :D"

"event","So what's new? I'm a slacker and haven't updated. School is over for the semester and I am still in limbo as to where I will be attending for the spring semester. It really sucks because I will get no classes and since I am applying to large universities, the textbooks usually sell out so what does that mean? More waiting for them to re-order. So the outcome of all of this? I get shit classes with shit textbooks, isn't that lovely? I am not all too thrilled that they are taking there sweet ass time in making a decision. I didn't do too poorly this semester thank you. I worked my ass off. I have a 3.2 this semester and a 2.7 overall. A 2.7 is rather shitty yes, but it is a great accomplishment from my Shepherd days. Here are my grades:\

Religion- A
American Literature 242- A
World Literature 251- A
Geography (hardest class ever)- C
Art History-C 

The C's kind of suck, but at least they are passing grades! I really want to hear back from UMBC because well, I think everyone knows the reason I want to attend there besides the fact that they do have a good English and Education program. Also, I wouldn't be living in such a rich area (i.e. the ghetto) so perhaps I'd like it a little better. The college is actually located outside of the city, not in the city so that is a plus. GMU would be okay I suppose although I'd have to commute a hell of a time since I'd be going in rush hour (wahoo!). 

Since I have failed to update I will try to put my life into perspective so far: 
My mom is moving out soon (like on the 7th or 8th of Jan) which is sad, but she's 5 mins away so I can go see her whenever I want. I think it will be better for health wise since right now she is um, driving everyone insane. Not to sound mean, but we kind of think sometimes she is saying stuff for attention because I know my mom isn't dumb and she's sounding like an absolute lunatic who needs to be committed. Sometimes I just can't deal with her because she's too insane and I know she *really* isn't like that. My aunt (her sister) and my grandmommy are coming up tomorrow to help my mom out emotionally and to help her move. Then my cousin is coming up on the 7th to help too. I really like my cousin although she's like almost *gasp* 40 now. Anyway, hopefully that situation will be better.

My dad and I's relationship is getting better and although a part of me still hates him for this, I've just learned to move on, it's a part of life and things happen. I am moving to the basement as well which means more space and more privacy so that will be nice. 

Onward. 

Since school is out, I work a lot which is good I suppose. I didn't work much this week because I requested new years weekend off (still don't know what I'm doing!). They have decided to keep me throughout the rest of season since I was hired as seasonal which is good because at least I know I'll have a job and I do like my job although sometimes I dislike going to it. I like the people I work with and all the crafts stuff is starting to grow on me. 

So yeah, I don't know what I am doing for New Year's, hopefully getting extremely drunk and not caring :) Chris thankfully doesn't have to work, he was going to work this one night bar tending thing, but he isn't which is good :D I mean it does suck because that means he won't have that extra money, but haha, it's good for me. We are supposed to go somewhere over Spring Break so that requires money so we both need to save actually. I spent 55$ at Target yesterday and I didn't even mean to! Yeah so I need to stop spending money. I have this Old Navy gift card that is becoming increasingly hard to use because they don't have anything left in there store. I will use it sometime. 

So what else? My friend Beth got engaged and that's so exciting :) I'm so happy for her! We didnt get to see each other over xmas break cause I fell asleep ;\ I will go down and see her soon. 

Xmas was excellent btw, I had two. I had xmas with my family and xmas with Chris's family and that was nice as well. I got losta nice things and it was a nice time in general. I think the break from school is the most appreciated. 

Chris and I are fine too :) We hang out as much as possible because I always have to work the whole weekend, but it's still good. haha! I just read something in my actual journal I wrote about Chris when we first met which was like 9 months ago. Haha, I sounded like a retard! That just made my day. It was so long ago, jeez. March 11th or 14th or something near that time. Bahaha, I must have sounded like a complete idiot the first time I spoke to him. Oh well, I make a fool of myself anyway at least he understands :) Hahaha, that's just too funny. I would show him, but I'd feel too stupid. Anyway, so yeah, I must go because I'm meeting a girl from work to hang out and stuff. Perhaps I'll update more often when I have more intersting things to say."

"event","Well people I guess I should update since I haven't done that in like ages, almost 2 months to be exact. My life has been full of school, trying to get into another school (hopefully somewhere in MD), working my 2 measly jobs and hanging out with the boyfriend when I have time. I don't do much of anything lately and that is sad, but I am usually so tired after work and school and November means the end of quarter and that means I need to get my ass in the library and doing my homework. I have soooo much work to do and yet what am I doing...updating my journal. 

In the news: 
Relationship: almost 8 months (yay!). I am quite happy ...a little stressed sometimes, but it is going well. I don't get to see him as much due to work and rush hour (getting worse by the day). I bet right now he is playing ps2 as he usually does because he is married to it now. That is my fault for getting it for him for his birthday. So much for being a good girlfriend... On that note, I expect a nice, thoughtful Christmas gift. Not that it has to be expensive, but something he put thought into. I think I deserve it (not to sound snobbish), but I was talking to my friend Jenn, and we were discussing how our boyfriends do not engage in random acts of kindness, like getting us flowers or something small every once in a while. Not that is has to be a gift, but just something sweet and unexpected. I have never once gotten flowers. Not that I really like flowers to begin with, but it is the principle. I am not saying he is a bad or careless person, just I don't know. I guess he is forgetful. I still like him nonetheless. I want New Years to come too, I want to do something special as well...just like the two of us...I think that would be so cute (cliche, but who cares?). 

Onward: 

My mom quit smoking (or is in the process), she went one full day so far (not a lot, but I consider it a big step) and I am so proud of her! Also, she found an apartment and she is moving in on Jan which is cool. She is excited so I am excited too (I am sad too of course, but I can't be sad all the time). It will be a new life for her and it isn't like she isn't my mom anymore and I will go and visit her too. I will be living with my dad, which is okay I guess. He won't be around much, but that's okay too. I just don't want to think about the whole thing too much yet, because I'll start to cry and I don't feel like crying tonight. 

I haven't seen my friends in a while which sucks mind you. I hate working Saturday's because it would be a fine day to go visit my fwends. I also lack this money business to pay for the gas. I hate how gas prices are on the rise, again or did they ever go down? I do miss all of you and don't think that I don't, because I do. I think once school is over with it will be easier to see each other (I hope). 

So I guess that is it. There isn't much to report, just busy busy busy. Perhaps once the year progresses I'll have more exciting things to report. Overall, things are well."

So now, I get to sit here all fucking day because of you and feel bad about something that isn't even my fault. I haven't seen you all fucking week either and I could have worked today and made extra money, but noooo, I didn't because of you. I really hate you sometimes. 


I feel grey- in between and colorless. 
Not meaningful enough to obtain a real color or emotion. 
Stripped and unnoticed. 
Like a little girl lost in a festival of people, hoping her mom will come and grab her, 
but you never do. 
I am left alone. 
Cold and needy. 
Left to find the path that leads to safety on my own. 
With dirt and mud sticking to my salty face I crawl towards what I think is a safe corner. 
Tricked again. 
I fall deeper into the hole. 
Scratching at the sides of the wall with bleeding fingers, 
Screaming until nothing but a raspy squeak escapes. 
And I fall, 
hard,
upon glass like rocks. 
Fate. 
A tiny light protrudes from the cracks in the wall and I hear sounds. 
I pull my bleeding flesh from the rocks and cry out.
Tiny sounds escape and I try harder, but my lungs burn like fire. 
I bang my fists against the wall with pitiful strength. 
The sounds stops and it is dark again. 
Defeated.
Tears fall faster and little the rocks beneath me. 
I curl up against the cold cement wall and my body shakes violently. 
I try rocking back and forth to soothe my body, but I shake harder.
Bright lights overhead burn my pupils as I look up quickly. 
I see a figure- you.
I huddle closer to the wall, not wanting to feel your scaly skin on me again. 
I noticed my one wrist is still bound to the piece of rope and you yank me up towards the light. 
I fall hard on the tile and a hot bruise begins to form. 
You pick me up,
and we go, 
to the familiar black painted room where your dirty, rough sheets await my arrival. 
You tie my other wrist and I close my eyes, yet the tears still escape. 
You lick my bloodied lip and force yourself inside of me.
My wrists bleed as the rope pierces my skin as I wiggle and squirm.
You tell me I deserved this
You planned this, since the first time I smiled at you. 
Your breath is hot and sticky against my neck and I bite my lip harder, tasting the thick copperish blood, your sweat dripping on my forehead. 
Like a thousand splinters between my thighs, I cannot hold on any longer and I let my body go limp.
My head clouds and my mind goes black."

"event","You hold me and it means nothing. 
I try hard to feel - 
Wanted, desired, 
Beautiful. 
You kiss me,
and I feel dirty - 
Like I need a shower, 
to rub all the layers of skin from my body. 
You feel so soft and warm
And I try to cuddle. 
I am incapable of letting myself feel, 
Happy, comfortable. 
I try to let you in, but you seem distant, 
used up. 
Am I demanding too much of you?
Yet I feel, 
empty and naked. 
I always come crawling on hands and knees to you,
hanging on every syllable. 
Waiting,
endless waiting. 
Wanting a compliment, 
some form of acknowledgement.
So shallow. 
Like a heroin fix for my self esteem. 
It is an addiction - 
that only you can supply.
I need you, 
but it never leaves my mouth. 
I mumble about the future (with you).
Hoping for that acceptance,
so my ego and emotions can sore. 
I wait, 
endlessly waiting.
Disappointment fills my eyes, 
and I blink furiously.
Self conscious, 
of you seeing my weakness.
Yet, 
you do not even look over. 
So I let the flood gates open in your car. 
I let my face get whip lash by the wind, 
and cry harder. 
Body trembling,
fingers shaking, 
trying to turn the music up louder. 
Still viewing the world in drive by motion.
You- 
transfixed upon the distance gleams of headlights, 
never noticing. 
I sniffle one of those mucus filled congested sniffles,
escapes a unattractive noise. 
You turn your pupils towards me, 
but I continue to cry just as quick as the wind dries my face. 
Your inquiry to why I am crying sounds like a stranger asking for some spare change. 
Sincerity lost. 
I wipe my nose fast with my sleeve and move closer to the door. 
Your hand rubs my thigh softly, 
like a doctor examining for foreign lumps,
coarse and sweaty. 
Knowing you will not remember tonight.
Too high.
Too drunk. 
I tense my leg and force your hand from my barely clothed thigh. 
I hear you sigh. 
You try to mask it with a yawn,
but I know your sounds too well. 
Your knuckles are turning a reddish-white from exerting too much pressure as you clench the wheel. 
I see your mouth open slightly, 
but you never finish a sentence. 
My head speaks for you, 
It is all your fault. 
Oblivious to the wrong, 
we are too perfect, 
too cliche. 
Your body stiffens at the wheel and you inquire again. 
I cry harder, 
my whole body crying with me, 
deep, lung filled sobs rocks the tension between us. 
I barely hear, 
nevermind, 
and I suppress my tears. 
Where am I now? 
Still clinging to you physically, 
like a drug addict, 
waiting for her fix. 
Strung out on emotions and waiting for you,
to catch me,
without judgment."

"event","So, all of these new things have happened since I've last updated, well not really, but I like to think so. So I'm being pursued by this other person and I don't know what to make of it. I've been with the same person and am actually content, not fighting, for the last five months (going on six!) and it is a new experience for me. The whole Bobby relationship although it lasted as long as it did, was a horrible, stressful, abusive relationship so this normal relationship business scares the hell out of me. Also, when I don't get to see him for a weekend I start to get a little frantic. But I know this weekend was a busy one for him since he had to help his mom move today and tomorrow he has to get rid of the fleas that have magically found it's way into his apartment and his poor kitty. So, I mean I soo understand. He said we might get to hang out today, but I figured he'd be super tired from moving all that stuff so I mean it is cool. Too bad I've neglected my other friends! I just feel so incomplete when I don't hang out with him. Sad? Sure. So about this being pursued by someone else. It's weird. I don't view myself as a pretty, desirable, sexual human. I just view myself as a thinker, someone who likes to learn and absorbs themselves in it. Sure I converse with others, but I don't really think about them liking me or ever wanting to engage in sexual activity. I hung out with this person on Friday night and we watched part of a movie and talked for a while. Then I guess he thought it was time to have sex because he just sort of took out his penis. From living with someone it wasn't too weird since the person who lived with me didn't like clothes very much and I was used to him being naked around me, so it wasn't the penis that bothered me, it was the sudden abruptness of the whole situation. What exactly are you supposed to say? ""Nice penis!"" It was nice infact, but I don't think about other's penis's when I have someone... Needless to say I declined the sexual proposition and after making mindless smalltalk for a few minutes, I went home feeling weirdly dirty. I didn't know what to make of the situation. After getting home (which was about ten minutes later) he called to inquire if I was mad at him which I was not and he said he'd call me later. I just said okay because I don't know what to say in those types of situations. I have talked to him today but we didn't talk about the penis incident. Now, I never told him I was involved with someone because it didn't come up and I didn't think he would bring up sex so I didn't find it necessary. I viewed him as a friend to hang out with since my friends in Reston are sparse. So I do not really know what I have gotten myself into. He wants to hang out again (obviously because he did not succeed in getting his dick wet the first time) and I believe I may just have to keep delaying our meeting. It makes me nervous and uncomfortable. It's like asking to be raped. Maybe not quite that extreme, but you never know. He was rather persistent about the whole matter. So my next problem is do I tell Chris about this or not? I certainly didn't do anything wrong by hanging out with someone whom I thought would be a potential friend. Given, I was alone with him, but I never once touched him or made any indication I wanted to. Chris would be mad at the fact I went over to his apartment by myself and the potential friend was a guy. I've been advised not to tell him or bring it up in a different manner. I just feel so guilty, I don't know why. It's me for christs sake. I'm freakish with my emotions. Did I mention I'm kind of lonely? So this attention from another guy even though I have no interest in him is comforting. It's selfish I guess, but we're all selfish. I mean it is one weekend, not like a year so I should just suck it up. I mean next weekend I will be involuntarily be spending in WV with my family since my mother is forcing me to go. That means no time with Chris this week! I leave Fri and come back on Mon. Greeeat. I will make great efforts to call him only once the entire weekend. I'm such a loser, but once you have something nice, good, healthy, you want it so badly and you don't want to lose it. Hence, why I would never ever do anything with this other guy. Everyone wants to be wanted, needed, loved, and I think that is what I want more than anything. So Chris doesn't love me (and if he does, that's news to me!) and that's fine, I don't believe you can love someone after only 5 months, it takes time. I think that is why I was quick to hang out with this person because he had some interest in me (apparently more than I thought) and it is comforting. No one wants to be alone (well, my dad, but that is another issue) and I guess you take whatever is thrown at you. Is that so wrong of me? Probably because I'm a selfish brat. I don't really know how to explain what I am talking about, but in my head it makes perfect sense. It probably isn't logical though. 

More issues that have arisen... This whole financial aid thing and applying for a loan isn't going so well. I fear I have missed the deadline and will not be able to attend Towson Uni. I would cry and I haven't cried in a long time so it would be like a downpour. It would seriously hurt, but that is life and there would be nothing I could do about it. I have to call Towson on Monday and figure out the deadline and have them help me understand this whole process. I tried to apply for FAFSA today but it would have been nice to know that your parent has to electronically sign the form via a pin #. What a load of shit. So now I can't send that in until like Tuesday although I know I will get nothing! But that was what the loan thing said, you had to apply for FAFSA first and then if you do not get enough or any then I can apply for this loan. If I do get the loan, then what if I don't get into Towson? That would be another rainstorm exploding from my tear ducts. All of this stresses me out more than it probably be should, but this is my life here. I'd be living on my own either at Towson or VCU and I'd be working on finishing my degree so this is quite major. I would be happy at either places, but of course everyone knows I'd be happiest at Towson. Most of my friends (including one that I am not so happy with at the moment) think it is crazy of me to go to Towson and that I'm being really stupid. Yeah, she pisses me off right now and she wants to hang out tomorrow, but I really don't want to. That really hurt my feelings that she said that and I couldn't say anything because her argument was a lot stronger than mine, but it is MY life, not hers. I went to high school with her and she's really nice and all but sometimes she really pisses me off. Beth, Mary and Emily support either decision I make and I really am glad of that, it makes this process a bit easier. And as of now I still have no job and that sucks even more. A job would take my mind off some of this shit and add to the stress level more too. I just need a job...need money too. I need to call the bookstore back and pick up more job applications. I just hate the whole looking for a job process, I feel so...exposed. It's like here I am, I need money, hire me! So I need to call Towson on Monday no matter what and e-mail them too hoping I will get a reply since their phone lines are always busy. I need to start preparing my apps ...I have them done just not sent yet and write a personal statement for Towson and apply for my loan. Lots to do in a not so short amount of time. I have to move by Dec if I go to VCU or Towson. Scary. I have this lingering feeling I will not into Towson...it is something I think about daily and before I can sleep I think about it too. I haven't been getting much sleep lately due to everything that is on my mind. I wish my mind would shut up and let me sleep. I should probably go read some more of my American Lit so I don't have so much to do tomorrow. I feel like crying (not because of Chris, I am not that weak, thank you.) just for the sake of crying and of all the shit I have to do and will have to do in the future. On a note so lighter note, the parent situation isn't getting any better, it is infact getting worse. I swear one day they are just going to kill each other. I hate living in the middle. I guess I should go read and try to sleep.

Oh! I just remembered two things that have happened since my last update. Mary called Mike (marine Mike, chicago mike) and he is home from Iraq and living with his sister. It hurt of course. It hurts more because no one will ever understand and yeah it just makes me feel stupid and depressed. I would never call him eventhough I have the number. What would I say? To hear this voice again though... god he was sexy in every way. That is beyond the point though because it is something unattainable, something I can never have. So I must deal with this and forget all of our memories. Next, Bobby messaged me the other day but only said one word and then became silent and I figured something was wrong since we vowed not to speak to each other because well, I don't know why, but anyway I messaged him a few days later to inquire if the rumors were true that he got a chick pregnant. He confirmed this and my heart sank. It was a girl he had slept with obviously about 7 months ago in NY when he was living there. I asked him what he and the woman planned on doing and he said that the girl (thankfully) said she wanted him to have nothing to do with the child and that she was giving it up for adoption. Normally, I'd disagree, but in this case I think the woman is doing a good thing. For bobby to ever have contact with that child would be devastating for it. He's a complete lunatic now and I wish he'd commit himself to a psych ward for observation and treatment. He cuts himself excessivly and it scares me. He invovles himself with people who are also harmful to themselves and who have so many mental issues it is rubbing off on him, not that he didn't have enough of his own. But being Bobby, he wants custody of the child, but I don't think he'll get it. I'd be shocked if he did. He already has a name for it...Lithia Elizabeth (yes, after me and someone else). Lithia is god awful, but of course I think Elizabeth is a beautiful name. I just can't believe he's bringing a child into this world (well really the girl is, but it is half his). I would have had an abortion. He just isn't ready to truely understand what it takes to give your whole self into taking care of that child. I haven't talked to him since I found this information out. I didn't want to scold him or anything so I said neutral comments. I don't know if we'll talk for a long time which is fine by me. He still finds ways to hurt me which just shows he hasn't changed. So I think that is enough excitment for one night."

"event","Yet again I have not updated in a while because I'm lazy. I no longer work at Bread & Chocolate nazi corporation, isn't that lovely? I am thrilled. Sure I have no job at the moment and I have 0.00$ and owe money for my car payment, but I'll figure that out later. I still have time to pay it! I got an application for Waldenbooks and the prospects they will hire me are good. I need an address from my friend Meagan cause she is one of my references and then I can turn it in. I currently cannot get a hold of her though. In other news, school starts in exactly a week which sucks, but also good at the same time. I look forward to school and transferring schools. The more I think about it, I don't think Towson is going to accept me, I just have this fear. I am almost certain VCU will accept me. I am sure everyone knows my reasoning for wanting to move to MD and to attend Towson Univ. Shush. That isn't the WHOLE reason. But on that note, I shall update on how that whole situation is going. We hung out on Fri night which was neat, I had fun. We drank quite a bit and just watched Simspons DVD's then I spent the night. I've spending the night at his house a lot lately...kind of weirds me out to sleep by myself. Then on a very rainy Saturday afternoon he and I ventured to Richmond to visit my friend Beth. I've known Beth for ages and I don't get to see her that often. Anyway, on Friday night he expressed how he wanted to meet my friends which I found odd, but I was like alright, but most of my friends live in Richmond and he said that was fine. I asked him if he was sure he wanted to travel 2 hours, he said it was cool. Needless to say I had to drive in the rain. I think that worried him, but we made it in one piece. Traffic was monstrous, but this is the one time I must thank someone for being a nerd and bringing their laptop, he found alternate routes to Richmond from MD so it worked out that we by passed all traffic and this major accident they had on the bridge. We stayed at Beth's for quite some time. I haven't laughed so much in a long time. She's so silly (as Chris put it, in a good way of course). I am glad she likes him and he likes her, it works out well. He also got along well with her boyfriend, Kris (what a coincidence they are both named Chris and Beth has the same name as me, Elizabeth, weird). I asked him if he felt uncomfortable and he said no, which was good. He was a bit quiet at first, but I can understand, new people, new situation. Since him and beth's boyfriend were discussing cars and playing a video game, beth and I snuck into the kitchen to discuss this weird thing Chris and I have. She said I MUST ask him what our relationship is before I make a decision to move there. Of course that is easier said than done. She expressed how she didn't want me to get hurt and especially if I move there and stuff. I said I know and I know what she said made perfect sense, but it is so hard. All throughout the night she was like ""and Lizzy's boyfriend..."" I almost died and I knew Beth said that on purpose. I expected him to say, I am not her boyfriend but he said nothing, didn't even look surprised. Later on the ride home since I made him drive back cause I was soooo tired he didn't ask about that, which I was thankful for, but at the same time, it would have meant I could have brought up the whole relationship issue without it being so random. Well, I think he wanted to talk in the car, but I was so sleepy and he seemed bothered, I don't know. He said he had a good time and that he liked my friends. Then he asked what Beth and I talked about in the kitchen since we were in there for soo long, well I only half way told him what we actually talked about. I said we talked about my parents getting a divorce and like where I was going to move and stuff. Beth wants me to move their of course, but would totally support me moving to Towson too. I was like she likes you and stuff, but I didn't tell him we were talking about him more in depth. I didn't know how. I'm not good at stuff like that and I know he isn't. We both just hint at things which sucks, because that never helps the situation. I asked him in the car which school he would like me to go to and of course, I knew he would say this, ""honestly, whichever is best for you"". Typical! I mean what else can he say? Then I remember how Beth brought up the issue of what if he says he wants you to move there, but he doesn't realize you would be nearer to him and in his space since a lot of his friends live in Towson. I was like hmm...so my next question was: You wouldn't mind me moving to Towson? And he was like no, not at all. He didn't elaborate though, so I just left it at that. I didn't really know what else to say. So I've established from my first talks of Towson that he: 
*wants me to move to Towson because it is closer to him
*will help me find an apartment near school, but we're not moving in together (that was mutual, the last part).
*Is totally protective of who I have as a roommate and I find that cute. 
*Is just concerned for me in general and again, I find that cute. 
*Is so cute :( 

I will not make that list any longer because I will find it may continue for pages. 

The last one really had nothing to do with anything, but I realized how cute I thought he was on Friday. I had not seen him for a week (since I last camped out at his house the prior week). He had shaved since then (which is a very good thing, he looks much better) and he changed his necklace from this goofy like bead necklace thing to a small gold chain or silver, can't remember, but regardless it looked much better. I noted this and told him so. He said he really liked my hair (I got it cut/styled) and that it looked really good. Of course that made me feel super good and I probably blushed too, silly. I always take note of what I like about him or what he looks good in (clothes wise) and make it a point to tell him. He usually takes my advice. Like these pants that I think look really good on him he's worn them since and these jeans that look good on him too. He hasn't worn those, but I think they are dirty since he does laundry about once a month. I know that was probably the stupidest thing ever, but I really don't care. I am trying to think if there is anything else I should share with the people who probably don't read my journal. 

Oh! I am applying for a loan to go towards Towson Univ. It is the most complicated thing ever. There are so many damn forms and it's tedious and I hate it. I best get some money. Damn the gov't. You know, it is easier for an illegal immigrant to receive money for school than it is for a u.s. citizen. You think I'm wrong? Go look that up. It's true. It is so much easier for an alien to get money. Damn immigrants; go back to your country. I mean that in a nice way, sort of. I am cynical towards people who get loans that are a) immigrants b) do not need them c) immigrants and finally, d) are not from this country, hah immigrants!. That's enough about that topic though. Don't ask about the loan process because it isn't going so well. My dad and I figured I might not get that much because the gov't may consider my whiteness and my parent's income. Just because they appear to make a lot, doesn't mean they don't have other things to use that money on such as living. It isn't a lot for our area anyway. They should consider the area we live in as well, not just the dollar amount on a paycheck. We make chump change compared to the people who live in this area. So yes, I hate the gov't. Give ME some fucking money. I believe that takes care of the loan ranting. 

I believe I am going to Six Flags with Chris in Sept because my mom's company picnic is there and we can go for free, how neat. We were planning on going to Six Flags anyway, but if we don't have to pay for it, that's even better. I haven't been to Six Flags either, he says it's fun. It will be a nice vacation from school. Of which, I have this online Geography course, now you are probably thinking how hard could Geography be? Well you just don't know. I have SO much work to do. Maybe it's because it's online and he doesn't want us to slack. Anyway, I spent a fortune on textbooks ($400) and now I guess I have to use them. I have to start my Geography work before school is supposed to start just so I won't fall behind. I didn't anticipate that class would take up so much time. The book looks thoroughly boring too. I need all A and B's this semester too so I can prove to Towson I am not a slacker (although I really am!). I guess I should go start reading so I can be a little ahead once classes start. My world and Amer literature courses look oh, so thrilling. I believe I am going to have a lot of work in those classes. I have 4 texts for Amer. Lit II and 3 texts for World Lit I. I think I was crazy to take 2 literature courses, but I'd much rather take those than math. I loathe math more than anything. I took it last semester and I do not know how I got a C. I believe she felt sorry for me. I tried for the most part. I am glad homework counted in that class since I did all of it, well a majority of it. I need to take math for liberal arts 2, but I could not fathom taking it this semester. You wouldn't think it would be hard, but it was. It wasn't logical math; it was the most twisted math course I've ever taken. I guess whenever I transfer I will take whatever math I have to. I think I have updated enough for this evening. I know I don't update much, but I feel it would all be the same shit. Perhaps I should wait for something significant to happen. I think a lot is significant, but don't find time to write it all down. That's all for now."

"event","So, I'm back home after being away for a full week. I went to the beach from last Fri to this Weds and it was good times! The drive down was pretty uneventful due to it was dark and I cannot read in a Jeep Wrangler since I have wind blowing at me from all angles and it's rather bumpy. Also, Chris thinks going 80mph and switching lanes is going to get us their oh so much quicker. Yeah, he scared me a few times because I didn't think he was going to stop in time. He is a really good driver and all, but sometimes I am afraid he isn't going to stop. Anyway, we were supposed to stay at the beach until this Friday but his uncle was coming on Thursday to use the beach house (seeing as how it is his uncle's house) so we left on Weds and he asked me to stay the rest of the week at his house which of course I said yes. I came home today (finally). I had a grand time at his house too. It was nice just like not having to go home after we watch a movie or something. I made dinner for us too which was cute. Overall, it was a really good time. I drank entirely too much, but that's okay! I also got severely sunburnt as in, my skin looks like I got burned by a fire on my right shoulder. It's rather gross looking, but it will heal in time. Chris kept peeling my skin off since I am peeling and I thought it was gross, but amusing at the same time. I met his aunt (his uncle's wife) while staying in the beach house and she's super nice. I met her again when we had to swing by his work yesterday and she's just really nice and I'm surprised I got along with her. She asked me to come up next week to help their office (he and she both work at a doctors office) and I don't know if I will, they said they'd pay me which would be nice, but it's a hike and I don't think Chris wants me to travel that far and also it's like his space at work. Anyway, I didn't answer her, but I think I'll say no. Also, Chris met my parents on Weds night and that was neat since he had wanted to for a while. I need to meet his mom now and I am sure I will in time. I think it is weird I've met his aunt and another aunt of his, but not his mom. Yesterday was a really nice day we like went out to lunch and hung out with his friend for a little while then came back to his house and watched Master and Commander (that movie with Russell Crowe about a ship or something) and I made dinner, too cute huh? I didn't much care for the movie, but he did...but I think I was a little drunk too. It has just been a really nice vacation and I wish it didn't have to end, but I thought today I really should go home (which I did) and do some errands, laundry, and clean so I can get started on getting back into the real world next week. Also, I felt I needed to get him his 'me' time today and tomorrow. He did not seem agitated at all though this week and the biggest thing of all, we didn't fight once. :D We get along so damn well it scares me and he's NICE. I'm just not used to someone (a guy) being nice and actually considerate of me and caring of what happens to me. I mean he always makes sure I'm okay and stuff and that's nice. We are planning to go to Six Flags before the summer ends so that'll be nice too! I've never been. We also plan to go to Six Flags on Halloween cause apparently it's much more fun in the dark...hehe. So yeah, things are well I do believe. It feels weird to be at home though but I really wanted to come home today and just like chill out and do nothing except for unpack from the beach and stuff also, I wanted him to do be by himself for a bit cause people need space and stuff. Not much else is happening except for I start school in 2 weeks which is crap and I go back to work next week which sucks muchly. I hate work, I am thinking of really quitting this time, but then I must find a new place to work so I'm still thinking about that. I want to just work at some place in the mall. Anyway, I think I'm going to go read and relax. It is nice to be home though, but it was nice being able to spend time with him and go to sleep next to him. Oh, there are sooo many things I found that were cute that he did/said but I'll spare you the list."

"event","So it would seem I have problems sleeping lately. I will lay in bed for hours, tired, but not able to sleep. Then I'll wake up at 5:30 every morning wide awake for no reason at all. I really do hate it. I feel as though I never get enough sleep. Sometimes I'll wake up from a bad dream at like 3 or so but usually I can force myself to go back to sleep. I don't know what is up with this schedule, but it's happened to me all week and the previous weekend too. It REALLY sucks. If none of you don't know what it's like to just never have enough sleep (although there is no logical reason why I shouldn't be sleeping till at least 9am) then you suck. It doesn't matter what time I go to bed.... 3...10, I'll still wake up at 5:30 and stay awake until like 7:30 or so and perhaps fall asleep or I give up and just get up. I hate it so much. Usually I have to work at night so it would be nice to sleep until like noon... or at least 9!  I am thinking of getting some of that unisom they advertise on TV for sleeping problems. I mean this just sucks. It's summer, why on earth would I want to wake up that early? Also, even for the fall, I don't have to get up until 9:30 for my classes since they start at 11. Yes, I am complaining because it has become SO tedious. I cannot stand it. And I have stuff to do today and I know I'll lazily make my way through the day. I have to be in the car for about 3 hours tonight so perhaps I'll fall asleep in the car, but alas who could fall asleep in a jeep wrangler!? They have the lamest windows, they aren't windows, they are plastic and they are annoying so, I doubt that will provide any sleep. And I keep making typos and having to go back and delete them and that is annoying me too. I am a grouch today, but I have no gotten nearly enough sleep this week :( It catches up to me around like 2 or 3 and I'm like wow, I'm super tired. I got a nice 4 hours of sleep night, but not restful sleep, like the sleep where you still feel half awake. If anyone has any advice on how to advert this sleeping schedule my body has deemed right for me, please tell me. I'll lay down at like 11 or 12 read for a bit usually and then feel tired so I'll try to sleep, but never fails I'll be up till at least 1 or 2. 

At least today is Friday and that means...the beach! Yeah, I waited all week for this so I'm thrilled. Tooo bad last night he was like my aunt and her son are going to be there from Fri-Sun (the days we'll be there too) and I was like oh, how lovely... thank god they are leaving on sunday so we'll have mon-fri by ourselves. I haven't met anyone in his family yet so I am not sure what I am supposed to say. Also her son is 9, and he may ask pesky questions too. I hope he already told her everything she needs to know and she won't ask me. Of course, I will answer and speak since I am not rude, but it makes me feel uncomfortable. It's like not his mom, but close enough... he works with her too. So yeah, prepare for weirdness. So, I'm a little nervous about that too. but three days isn't bad of weirdness. Two really since we will arrive late on Friday night. That reminds me I still want to go shopping today, I want a cute sun dress, but I have failed to go shopping this week. Perhaps I'll go when the mall first opens to keep myself from snotty, spoiled, Reston monster children. Seriously! I went to the mall last Saturday to retrieve a bathing suit and are parents not parenting anymore? They find it necessary to let their screaming brats run around the mall without them and I'm like hello? Child molesters love the mall..especially bathrooms that are hidden around a corner. It's only Reston stay at home bitchy moms, I swear. Now, I do love kids and enjoy them very much, but these kids are like their own breed. And the parents are the problems, they don't discipline their children, saying softy ""don't run"" isn't going to do jack shit to a 3 year old. I remember my mom never let me or my brother get away with stuff like that in the mall. It was like a treat to go to the mall so if we acted poorly, we'd go home. And that doesn't sound harsh at all to me, it was showing me we couldn't act like that and get away with it! What's wrong with discipling your kid? As long as you don't beat them senseless or use other objects, I think it is quite called for. However, if they just do a minor thing, I would say that calls for a yelling or something other than a spanking, it has to be major, like running across the road w/o the parent (which I have seen all to a many times). But then, I guess you could say that is the parents fault for not watching the thing or holding it's hand...hm. I guess I rant too much about that, but people in Reston are stupid with their children, they are making them dumber. If you lived in Reston, you'd know. My dad noticed it there the other day too so I'm not the only one! I guess it's just because when I worked with the little kids at pre-school, they were so good, and so behaved...and I just have a fondness not to see children get run over. I think being a teacher with be quite rewarding for me, I can't wait. And I think also, I'd like to have my own kids because I don't think I'll be too bad of a mommy. I think I'm quite motherly, yet still practical and not off in my own little world. Nor, would I buy a stroller that could pass for a small compact car. Again, blame Reston. Now that I have throrougly bashed Reston stay at home bitch moms (it was deserved) and my sleeping habits, I feel much better. Even though, it's almost 8 and I have start getting showered and things, I still feel better. It was the most pointless post ever. And now I will stick to me posting after I get back from the beach. 

I will missss you Emily and Mary, but I shall call and let you know how things are unfolding.  <3"

"event","Yeah, so I haven't updated in a while because I have been lazy and busy at the same time. Well, I finished my last summer class today, thank god. A week early too! That final was hard as anything. I am glad it is over though. I got an A on my last essay for that class though, I was pleased. I had a mini celebration on Saturday for that and well, Sunday too, haha! On Friday I leave for the beach for a whole week, yes one full week of no work and no nothing, YAY. I'm going with Chris of course which makes it even nicer. His aunt has a place in Ocean City so he invited me. Things are quite well with him and I, as far as I know. We hung out all weekend which was excellent. We went hiking/swimming. I'm a little nervous,  I must admit because I haven't spent seven full days with him, ever. I mean we've seen each other for like two days at a time and that's fine, but a week? I have my fears, but I think it will be fine. We haven't really ever fought, I don't think at least. I mean I think I've been mad at him before or in a bad mood for some other reason, but usually he makes me laugh so it works out. Or he'll start poking me! Of course then I go to hit him back and haha, did that ever fail. I kept hitting my hand on the arm of his chair. Yeah, we play fight and shit like that, yes it's lame, but it's cute at the same time. So yeah, why am I nervous really? I don't honestly know, I just am. I guess a lot of alcohol consumption and tanning will help that. So needless to say, I'm super excited and I think I should stop talking about it before I become overly excited. So, tomorrow I have work and I know it is going to be the most tedious event since i know that very next night I'll be on my way to the beach with someone I get along with so well. We aren't leaving until like 8pm on Friday cause of traffic and he has work. Friday I have to like finish packing and do some other random shit so that will too be a long day, but if we're leaving at like 8..my day will go by so much quicker. It's Thursday that will take FOREVER. So now that has been said that is really all that is going on in my life. Work, school (well I finished for now!), hanging out with Chris, and um, sleeping. I never see any of my other friends really anymore...I know I'm bad. I just I don't know...I always want to hang out with chris. I haven't talked to Meagan and Katie in like forever, I feel so bad. I try to hang out with Casey, but she's always with her boyfriend sooo...and she has changed a lot and I dont feel connected to her anymore. I talk to Beth every once in a while and that's good because her and can talk about every little thing and I've known her since like 7th grade. And I think she'd like Chris too, she approves mostly though, she has to see him though. So, yeah, that has been my summer...full of work which I hate btw. Tomorrow will be the longest work day ever known. Friday will go by quickly, I'm sure. My goal for the beach, swim some, get super sunburnt, get drunk, sleep a lot, walk around the boardwalk, get more sunburnt, and read a ton, oh and hang out with chris of course. I want not to think about work or school for the whole week. That's my goal. 

In other news, I think I may have decided to live with my dad, I have not told my mother yet, I do not know when I am going to tell her, but soon. I know she will feel hurt, alone, and mad...but I think living with my dad would be for the best. I am just so confused in that department....I feel torn and in the middle. I will figure it out though because I must do what is best for me. I don't really feel like writing about that subject though, it's depressing. I started a new book last night, it's quite good so far. I don't know if I'll ever finish The Fountainhead, oh well. Someday. Anyway, I think I am going to go read, hah! Aren't you so glad I updated? I won't update until after the beach unless something happens in the mean time, like the beach plans getting foiled. Let's hope that doesn't happen."

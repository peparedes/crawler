She seems dressed in all the rings 
Of past fatalaties 
So fragile yet so devious 
She continues to see it 
Climatic hands that press 
Her temples and my chest 
Enter the night that she came home 
Forever 

Oh (She's the only one that makes me sad) 

She is everything and more 
The solemn hypnotic 
My Dahlia, you're bathed in posession 
She is home to me 

I get neverous, perversed when I see her to worse 
But the stress is astounding 
It's now or never she's coming home 
Forever 

Oh (She's the only one that makes me sad) 

Hard to say what caught my attention 
Fixed And crazy, Aphid Attraction 
Carve my name in my face, to recognize 
Such a pheromone cult to terrorize 

I won't let this build up inside of me 
I won't let this build up inside of me 
I won't let this build up inside of me 
I won't let this build up inside of me 

(Yeah!) 

I'm a slave, and I am a master 
No restraints and, unchecked collectors 
I exist throught my name, to self ablige 
She is something in me, that I despise 

I won't let this build up inside of me 
I won't let this build up inside of me 
I won't let this build up inside of me 
I won't let this build up inside of me 

I won't let this build up inside of me 
I won't let this build up inside of me 
I won't let this build up inside of me 
I won't let this build up inside of me 

SHE ISN'T REAL! 
I CAN'T MAKE HER REAL! 
SHE ISN'T REAL! 
I CAN'T MAKE HER REAL! 

(She isn't real, I can't make her real) 


i love this song!!!!"

Im being truthfull she waited to long, and she played with my head for to long. I told her but she dont care about anything but what she thinks. Ill miss her but im moving on and she has to.

I haven't seen any doable chicks in here, as a matter of fact they are like a carpenters dream, flat as a board and easy to nail. Oh Well... Now I'm begining to work on my final and I still haven't done my report for english, I'm going to be in really deep shit if I don't do my stuff already. Well, now with all this said in conclusion I haven't seen any doable chicks today except that one hot peice of ass Carolyn in wed color theory class, Steve has class with her, but we will not disclose Steve's original name, we'll pretend his name is Steve, so therefore we don'
t really know if his name is Steve or not. My g/f just called my wondering about my website, now Alex is telling me that his g/f is calling him and he's saying ""Steve stop... stop... look.. I've got a missed call, it's my g/f Debbie."" Now you are all really confused and well... you should be Ha HA Ha }=o)> who is this typing, why am I still reading this? These are questions that I cannot answer for you, and now Alex just asked how fast I can type I think my GWAM is like 65 with only two fingers? Impressive? Naw... maybe notAlex just called me gay, brb I'm gonna have to shove his face in the girl's toilet after some fat broad just took a dump. As if you guys didnt know that was my friend steve he was bored so he wanted to tell a story ok bye for now"

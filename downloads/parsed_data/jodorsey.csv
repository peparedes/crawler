"event","This semester as a whole has been a great experience for me. Many of the Theories that we learned in the class I had some idea about and others I did not have any idea about prior to this class. As far as the final exam is concerned I think the study guide was very consise and detailed enough to follow in order to have a successful exam. The study guides have always been a benefical factor in the key to my success each exam that we have taken thus far. The extra credit opportunties were also greatly appreciated. Extra credit always helps especially when you are a few points from a letter grade. Any extra credit oppourtunity is helpfull whether it be one or five points. The only thing that made these last couple of weeks more challenging than the previous weeks is the fact that all the work that I have in other classes are pilling up and slightly affecting my studying for this class. But that is where I really have to push myself and get the job done. Although this class had a lot of work in it, I belive that I learned some new theories and ideas that I did not have before this class, so I think I benefited from this class. Even though I need it for my major I still found this class to be somewhat enjoyable, at least more enjoyable than stressfull."

"event","The work load for the semester seems to be getting harder. The material that we are learning seems a lot more challenging and length than the previous chapters. The reason I feel this way is probably because the work load is getting heavier all of my  other classes as well. The material may seem a little more challenging and it that may be the case, but this paper that we have to do might be an added feature that may make things seem a little more challenging. The paper is not to complex, and the length is not to much to ask for, but with everything else that I have to do makes it seem like an almost impossible task. I know that succeed, but this time around I will have to put more effort into this test than the previous two. What makes this test coming up so hard is that I have too many other items that just happened to pop up this week. Therefore study time is going to be limited for this test. My overall goal in this class is to recieve an ""A"" I know if I get what I need to do done, then I should have an ample amount of time to get suffiecient study time in."

"event","The papers that we were assigned to do seemed to be a large burden to me at first. It is near the end of the semester and I was begining to get more than enough work to do than ever before. Although this paper is part of the cirriculum, I did not feel motivated like the last paper to do. But then something occurred. The last Homework assignment!! How fun can that be? A homework assignment and now a paper under my belt as well. To my knowledge the last homework assignment was the rough draft of the paper. This made me think. This last homework assignment could be a helpful tool in writing a succesfull paper. The first thing that this assignment does is force us to begin working on the paper in advance. The second is that if we have a portion of the paper done we can get back significant amounts of responses to help improve our paper. So this assignment actually is more helpful than a burden! I was forced to start on my paper eary and also I will recieve feedback from my class mates as well as the professor regarding my paper. This assignment to me actually made the paper significantly easier. Now I am able to recieve feedback and I can adjust my paper accordingly. I have more than enough time now to devlope a quality paper. There should be no excuses when the final grades are given on this paper because we have been given enough time and more than enough help on it than we deserve!!"

"event","The last couple of weeks have been kind of different. The fact that the overhead has not been working and the fact that I have been coming to class kind of late has really started to affect me. I am so used to the style of the overhead projector, that when it did not work and we had to take notes by listening, was different. It was different in the sense that I was not used to this style of taking notes, which made it a little challenging to look over them and review them. I do understand that there is slides we can print out that are equivillant to the overhead projectors that we discuss in class, but the best way I learn is by visual and listneing. When one of those things that help me learn the best is taken away from me (i.e. The visual overhead part) It makes it a little more challenging for me to grasp the material than I am used to. Since things can not go anyones way all the time, one must find an alternative way to keep processing and learning the material in a different way. In order to compensate for the lack of visual overheads, I have just learned to read a little more clearly and careful than before so that I can grasp the material."

"event","I thought the group project were going to be more complicated than what the actually were. I usually do not like group activities, but this one I found to be very effective and usefull. The people in my group this time where people in the class that I had never worked with in the previous groups. I found this as a good way to interact and get to know the other members in my class. I got along with all the members in my group. I felt like this was more than just an assignment to me. I found that working with new people is benefical, in the sense that you have to learn to compromise. We didn't have any problems as a group. We split all of the work up evenly. We would stay in contact with each other by e-mail. This is how we could keep up with the progress of other group members. When we were all done with our part, we e-mailed everything that we had done to one person in our group. This person typed it all out. We all agreed that this should be done so the paper could make sense. There was no controversey with the way we handled this project. During the presentation everyone will speak on the subject matter they researched."

"event","So far I like the new subject material we are being taught. The two-step flow theory and the Diffusion theory I am somewhat familiar with these theories because I learned this in my Media, Power, and culture class last semester. We did not go into depth about these theories, we just briefly touched on them. I still need to review these theories thouroughly before the quiz. The term gatekeepers, I am very familiar with this because this is the main thing I remember from my my previous class. It is said that gatekeepers control the flow of information to a group. The other theories that I need to brush up on the Geroge Gerbrer's cultivation theory and the Uses& Gratifications theory of Mass Communication. The reason being is because of the fact that I have never heard of any of these theories prior to this class. Many of the theories we learned I am somewhat familiar with. The only thing that really bothers me right now is the fact that our quiz is coming up to fast, I feel like I don't have enough time to review for it."

"event","This week was an interesting week. The test this week consisted of an extra chapter that we had to know! Im not complaining, but I found that to be a little on the intimidating side. Mabey because it more would be on the test. But as soon as I figured out that I just would have to face up to the fact that I might have to put in more study time than I did on the previous test. So in all actuality it was not a major problem, just a little more time was spent preparing for this test. Anyway, I enjoyed these chapters of traits I found them quite interesting, not that I never find anything we learn boaring, because I am enjoy communication classes. Its my minor so I had better enjoy it! The only concepts that I had a hard time grasping was the was the theory that had the latitude of resistance, latitude of acceptance, and latitude of no-commitment. I just could not understand the meanings that well, I just understood the basics. I believe that was the only thing that troubled me during these four chapters. Other than that I felt like I had a good grasp on all of the other material. I learned a great deal about verbal agression and agruementativeness. When we did the survey on how argumentative or verbal agressive we were I found that to be very enjoy able. The funny thing about the outcomes of the survey was that I was both High on verbal agression and high on argumentativeness. I didn't understand how that occured, but if that was the correct outcomes then I find that to be extremely funny, hopefully I added the numbers up correctly, I probably will double check just to make sure."

"event","Last week we had the discussion about verbal aggression and arguementativeness. I was trying to figure out wheter I had more of one than the other. I believe that I have great arugmentative skills when it comes to certain situations. For instance if I know I can win an argument based on the context then I can argue for my life. But if I do not know alot about something then I will still try and argue. But when I get mad at someone or something I have a tendancy to verbally aggress the character. An example of this would be my ex-girlfriend. Sometimes she makes me so mad I feel like I have no chice but to attack her character. Because the things she does are so ignorant. Forget an argument about the situation, I feel like I have to prove a point by making her feel bad. If I make her feel bad then It makes me feel better. So I have come to the conclusion that verbal aggression comes from within the person. Everyone is verbally aggressive in one way or another. I also belive that verbal aggression is dirived from destructive traits. If one is already irritated to begin with it kind of fuels verbal aggression to an extent. I think for one to be successful in agruing one has to be in the right state of mind, if not then one verbal aggressiveness has a tendancy to take over in my opinion."

"event","this week the most interesting things that I found out were the fact that there was so many different traits that a human being has. I find this to be very interesting and very confusing at the same time. The things that I found most confusing was the fact that their are so many aspects of traits. For example contexts, traits and States. Contextual views consist of behavior's that very across contexts. For example this means that how one acts in a classroom is not how one acts at home with the family. But with apprehension traits their is context based Ca. I tend to get these two mixed up. An example of this would be fearing only large audiences but not one on one action. The the different types of traits consist of apprehension, presentation, adaptation and aggression traits. These traits then break down into special individual aspects. For example an example of a presentation trait would be a dramatic and or Friendly person. This is the items that tend to interest me the most but at the same time confuse me. Hopefully we can go over these a little more during class because many of these diffenent aspects of traits run together."

"event","This week was quite interesting but complicating at the same time. The  first item i would like to discuss it the test that we took last tuesday. I felt like I was well prepared for the test and that along with my preparation, feel like the study guide helped a lot. Sometime teachers put so much material on the study guide that is not relevent to the test and or things that are never on the test. I feel like the test was fair and that it tested the knowledge that we have covered in class thus far. I know as a student we don't have much say on how the test is to be made up, but as far as the items that were covered in class and on the test, went along with the study guide as well, so I respect the fact that you are really out to test what we know and what we went over. Not test us on something that we did not go over in detail. The next item of business that I would like to discuss is the new chapter 4. Although I am not to clear on the concept of this chapter quite yet, I did not have a problem with our homework assignment that was due. I found a journal article pertaining to argumentation and verbal aggression. I found the journal to be quite interesting as well as helpful. What homework assignment do you know of that is reletively fun? This was probably the second assignment in my entire life that I enjoyed to an extent"

"event","The item that interested me the most this week was the groups we had to participate in and analyize the different paridigms that we discussed in class. The relevnace of this activity was high. The main reason being is that we had to work in groups and communicate with each other and come to mutual agreements about the items that we discussed. We were talking about different communication perspectives while communicating among the groups we were all displaced in. So I found that the group activites were very helpful. Another thing that these groups helped me do was to understand more of a perspective that I was hardly familiar with in the first place. The perspective we were given to analyize was the systems perspective. Proior to this I did not understand this paradigm very well. So I felt that given this perspective to analyize would give me a chance to get in to more depth about this perspective and understand it more than I did before. We used the example of a long term relationship and related it to the systems perspective. A relationship has many different aspects about it. Long term relationships and especially marriage bring many components. Components such as children and family members. What I mean by this is that someone could have been in a previous relationship and or marriage with children from their previous relationship that have to now be included in the current relationship in order for it to function correctly. As well as family members from each side of the relationship as well. I have come to understand that a relationship is much like a business in some sense because if one aspect fails then it can affect the entire relationship. Relationships are interdependent. There are different elements that must work in oreder to make the entire relationship work. Everything depends on one another. This example helped me understand the systems theory more in depth."

"event","The thing that interested me the most this week was our discussion on the different paradigms of communication. The Four that we learned in class were very helpful in explaining as to why we communicate the way we do. Each theory displays their strenths and weaknesses as to explaining the phenomia that occurs during communication. Prior to this I was unfamiliar with these four theories explaining communication. As a matter of fact at first I thought learning these theroies would be a hassel and anoying, but after analyzing them a bit I found each of these theories to be quite useful. The least favorite of the four theories that we have disscussed so far is the laws perspecitve. The reason being is that it is so cut and dry. ""If this happens then, this will follow"" This theory is obviously good for prediction for groups as a whole, but as far a anything else goes it is a bad theory in my opinion. The fact that human choice is not a strength of this theory, makes it in some sense weak. I say weak because everything is based on human choice. Everyone does not think alike. So for a theory to say for example: If I tell a ""funny joke"" then everyone will laugh. Now the problem with this is that it depends on what was said, everyone might not find the joke funny. Jokes sometimes vary from perosn to person. Was the joke offensive? To whom was it offending? These are the things that one must take into account when assesing this theory. Yes people may laugh at the joke, but will everyone laugh? Probably not. Based on how vulgur and explicit the joke is is not taken into account. Which leaves out a persons person's perception. How they preceive the joke. That is one of the primary weaknesses of the laws theory in my opinion. I think that this should not be used because of the fact that human choice is not taken into consideration, free will is what makes humans so special, to leave that major component out of a theory makes it usless"

"event","The topic that comes to mind about this week is the question of communication as a whole. What is exactly communication and how does it differ from other theories that are out there? The discussion of what exactly communication is always justifyable. I now understand why the definition of communication is so complex. For example is it communication when someone beeps their horn at you, but it is not intended for you to hear? When this example was brought up in class this really made me think. Did communication take place because the attention of the unintended source took place? Their was no shared meaning, but communication had to have taken place. It is situations like this that make communication so interesting. There are always situations that take place where at first it does not seem like communication, but after studying the situation in great detail their is always communication that takes place somewhere. Although some of these concepts are very challenging to grasp on to, the study of communication can never stop at just one solid deffinition."

"event","i know i haven't been keeping up with this thing. i haven't even been weighing since like a month ago. i've been eating mostly baked/low fat chips and crackers or rice. i'm my second bottle of Tetracal. i'm hoping by staying away from the scale it will grant me a better reading on the scale when i finally do weigh myself. my pants do feel looser. it sure is slow going though. i think i won't get as good a result as i thought i would. and i think they still have Tetracal available but i don't think i can blow another 80 bones.

oh well. i guess, as per usual, we'll see what happens."

"event","i know it's been more than a week since my last weigh in. i was hoping by letting more time pass i'd have more weight loss to report. but i don't. we went to the mall tonight and while there i used the scale at GNC only to have the little printout say i weight 190. what a crock. i'm taking these damn pills, with 25mg ephedra alkaloids in them - which is 5 more than the Metabolifts i used several years back that gave me such drastic success. and i'm actually where i started off more than 2 weeks ago? i don't know what to do. i live off sweet tea, bread, and crackers with the occassional coke and a restaurant treat maybe once on the weekends. i try to exercise a bit too. i take the pills as directed. what the fuck? 
i must say i do think my pants fit looser so maybe its just that these are geared toward fat loss/muscle mass preservation and so as i lose fat i'm keeping/gaining muscle? i dunno. i'm not giving up yet, but the scales sure are discouraging. maybe it's time to go full-on water/juice fast and get hardcore on the exercise? i doubt i could keep it up. as much as i want to lose weight, i barely have to willpower to resist fatty food, much less stop eating entirely. 

i guess we'll see what the numbers say next week."

"event","187 lbs according to this stupid digital scale. i returned the old one and kept the new one i bought - for a $38 scale, it sucks. last night it kept saying the battery was low. i'm thinking i'll just start using the scale at GNC at the mall. i don't really need the body fat calculator on the scale because i can use an online one. according to the manual, that one doesn't really work unless your feet are slightly damp or something. wack. so i'll use it to keep track but i'm going to start going by the printouts from the GNC store scale.

i haven't managed to get up and do the Lifetime channel workout show at all. too early for a night owl like me, lol. i might just get an exercise tape so i can do it when i get up midmorning. maybe not exercising is why i haven't lost more. it's not like i've been eating much. i guess we'll see if i can keep it up a little more hardcore this week and burn off more fat. 3 lbs a week is only 12 lbs in a month and i've only got 2 months supply - these things were too damn expensive to only get 24 lbs out of them. especially when i've got to lose at least 40. 

i think i remember it starting out slow with the old metabolifts too though. had to work up a momentum i guess.

we'll see how much more i've lost next week."

"event","yay!!! my shipment of Tetracal arrived! 2 months supply! i just took 2 with a handful of grapes since i haven't eaten to start up metabolism today and i'm drinking some nice cold bottled water. 25mg ephedra alkaloids, can ya believe it? i was disappointed because i didn't get up to do Daily Workout with Denise Austin on Lifetime network this morning but i was actually ok with that because i got up around 9am for the first time in forever and actually stayed up! i got my new scale and weighed in this morning - 190lbs exactly. so that's my jump off point. i might weigh myself tonight just to see how well one dose worked - or i might not. either way i'm going to try to avoid the scale until next wednesday. then we'll see how much i've lost in a week!

so here it is. the beginning of the end of diets and crap - i'm about to change the way i look at everything. i know i seem cheesy right now, can't help it! i'm excited and i truly do want to change my eating and exercise habits and change my life. here goes!"

"event","well, finally was able to order a product i've been eyeballing on the website of this fitness place in California. you can't get to the link from the website in general (at least i couldn't) and i don't remember how i found it to begin with but they have a list of products available containing ephedra. they have stuff like diet fuel, and some copycat products of things like ripped fuel and hydroxycut. 
anyway, i ordered this stuff called Tetracal, and it contains 25mg of ephedra alkaloids! i ordered 2 months supply. depending on well it works in conjunction with a new exercise routine and some diet changes, i may order more if i can. i'm hoping 2 months is all i need. 
it should be here within a week. then i can truely use this journal for what i intended - weight loss tracking, diet and exercise planning, and all that good stuff.

if i get screwed on this stuff like i did with the metabolift on ebay, then i give up on diet pills.

"event","i haven't even refreshed my memory of the last post i made yet. i'm sure i made some half assed promises and didn't keep them.
i have a scale now but i'm currently deathly afraid to weigh in (and kinda relieved that the damn thing doens't work well). it's a digital one that calculates body fat percentage too and i got it at goodwill (looked like a store display, no box). well, it doesn't come on half the time and the other half of the time it wont cut off. i managed to program it to do fat % once but haven't been able to get it to do it since. i'm thinking of seeing if i can find the same scale at target, buying it, and then putting the crappy one in the box and returning it.
last time i weighed in (over a week ago) i was doing really well and living off kashi crackers and rice with fat/calorie free butter spray to liven the rice up (and drinking sweet tea as usual). i was hovering around 186-190, if that damn scale was even working half right. it always said something different.
but then my mom visited this past weekend and we pigged out at Logan's Roadhouse on friday, grilled on saturday, and grilled again on sunday. potatoes, steaks, shrimp, hot dogs, we really did a number. so i feel like a whale. i put on my bathing suit top and a pair of shorts to go in the hot tub at a friend's house and was so disgusted (but not disgusted enough to keep me from indulging).
the hydroxyburn don't seem to work as well as those metabolifts used to and ebay is pretty much cracking down on any listing that contains the words ""hard to find formula"", ""original formula"", or anything like that. if it doesn't say ephedra free they take it down. or if the listing survives it shoots up to over a hundred dollars and i wanna be skinny but i just can't afford that shit. might as well save up for lipo, lol. 
i think i may have found something on a website, i emailed them today to make sure they still carry the product and then i'll have to order it when i get paid next week. if it weren't for rent i'd have ordered it last week.
well, i'm about to take a shower. if they scale is working, then i'll post the results, disgusting though they will likely be. if not, i'll wait a week, see if i can get back on track, and see what happens.

"event","i went to GNC on Sunday and used the scale - 187 lbs. so i have lost a little. i'm going to try to take 2 doses today of the HydroxyBurn and see how that goes, and i'll weigh again on Sunday. i made chili last night and had some. i used lean meat if that helps. otherwise i've been snacking on homemade bread i made last night. and at work tonight i'll snack on some Kashi crackers on my break. i'm off tomorrow and i'm going to try to do some cleaning and stuff. i guess we'll see this Sunday how much more i lose.

"event","well, even though i didn't update for almost a month again, i decided to leave that other entry up and explain. turns out that the fed ex link was for something else i ordered, some BioSilk for my hair. so i ended up filing a dispute with paypal since it was becoming apparent that this asshole was running auctions for something he wasn't sending out to the winners. now his ebay account is suspended but paypal couldn't get my money back because of insufficient funds in his account >:-( i'm not sure what else they'll do about it. 

anyway, so i didn't get the pills, then we moved in a new apartment about a week and a half later and i've been working a lot. i had won a bottle of ""hydroxyburn"" for under $10 bucks and figured for that i could afford to see what it was about - it came in the mail last monday and it contains EPHEDRA!! yay! so i've been taking that. i've been taking one dose and now i'm about to go up to two. and i'm still keeping an eye out for more auctions to see if i can score more pills - hell no i'm not paying $100 for one little bottle of Metabolife but if i see a deal i'll watch it. the downside to this stuff is i have to take 4 pills at a time to get the same stuff i was getting out of two Metabolift. but oh well. as long as it works i can choke it down. there was only 160 caps in the bottle but maybe i can get a good 15-20 lbs out of it. better than nothing. 

i also take these ""diet smart"" vitamins now, because last time i took my daughter to the WIC office for a checkup they checked my iron level and it was lower than it was previously. i'm supposed to be taking a prescription iron supplement that my doc gave me after i had my son 3 months ago but i can't find the pills - i think i may have accidently tossed them. i figured my iron would be better by now! but apparently i'm still anemic. dieting probably doesn't help but i don't care, i'd rather get skinny now and get my iron up later than keep getting fatter and surpassing the size 18 mark. so anyway, i figure a multi vitamin would be good for me, especially since i don't eat very well, and these vitamins also contain EGCG, which is something made from Green Tea and has added caffeine - supposed to aid your body in metabolizing fat. so i take one of those a day and i take these HydroxyBurn things and we'll see what happens. i think i'll go to GNC and weigh myself today on my lunch break.

i don't know for sure if this lady was buying this size for herself or not but i was ringing up a lady the other day - she had this big bubble butt (not the attractive kind of bubble booty but this big fat ass) and gut rolls and all that. and she was buying size 16 pants. and i'm thinking 'i wear 18's and i know i don't look as big as this heifer'. that's so infuriating. to not look that big but to have to practically shop plus size because they don't make clothes in juniors, or even in misses sometimes that fit me? bleh. anyway, soon that won't be a problem. i'll get down to at least 150-160 and i'll be able to wear 14's again and i'll be so happy. :-D

gotta go get ready for work."

"event","i deleted the past entries since i didn't keep my word and update every day. hell, i barely updated at all. i guess i was kind of depressed because not eating much didn't work like i wanted it to and after a week i'd gained like 5 pounds. NOT cool. so i kinda gave up and i was out of Metabolift w/ Ephedra and i binged on some really fattening stuff like chips and string cheese and candy and whatnot. i haven't weighed in about a week or so - i think i'm still around 195. all i know is my ""fat jeans"" (size 18) are getting uncomfortable and i refuse to buy anything in a size 20. i flat out refuse.
i had ordered some Metabolift w/ Ephedra off Ebay but the fucker i ordered it from is notorious for taking forever to ship, i come to find out. but i got an email with the FedEx tracking link for it so it's expected to arrive tomorrow (yay!). so then i start aggressively taking pills and sticking to low cal, low fat foods. and drinking water, and exercising, and all that good shit. no more lazy fat cow ass. i'm tempted to post the thinspiration pics i took of my flab about a month ago, to motivate myself more. but i'm scared someone i know would find me out, or my boyfriend would see it and get mad about me posting naked pics of myself (even though i <i>know</i> no one would be using pics of my whale blubber whack off to or anything, not like i'd be posting them to show off to anyone). i'm surprised he finds me appealing at all but i guess he should. carrying two of his children has helped make me look the way i do. :-P
so i wait for my happy pills. and i will go to GNC again by the end of the weekend to weigh in so i'll have a starting point. here's the plan:
2 pills in the morning when i get up.
2 pills in the afternoon before i go to work (or right as i get to work). 
my goal weight is 140 lbs - i guess by the fall. i'll have to find more pills on ebay or something to keep stocked.
anyway, just a few more hours and my pills should be delivered by my friendly FedEx man - i'll post again once i've weighed in."

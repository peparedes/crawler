"event","i'm so inlove with the idea of being inlove again.
i want him so bad
and i don't even know who him is..
yet.
just the guy that is made for me..
that's who i want.

i have someone.
but when i think about it
i don't know why i date
i mean i know why...
but he's not the one that is meant for me.
how i know that..
how do i not know that?




so, i'm painting my room.
dark purple.
which has nothing to do with what is on my mind,
but after spending 15 years in the same room
i finally get the chance to change the color on my damn wall.


so, this guy was talking to me about christianity today downtown
and those people used to make me really think about what i believe
but today,
today was different for some reason.
he was asking me questions like where i thought i was going to go if i died today.
heaven or hell?
and i was like...
"" i don't exactly believe in heaven or hell.""
and he was like 
"" okay,bleh bleh God bless "" and handed me a flyer for a 'christian concert '
i don't know.
but i respect people like that
they have the courage to go up to random people and talk about their beliefs
and when i asked him questions..
he actually gave me good answers.


wow, i haven't written in here for awhile.

i'm obsessed with someone
hahahhahahaa
i'm such a loser."

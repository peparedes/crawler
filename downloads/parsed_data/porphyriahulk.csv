"event","i got a whole bunch of magazines today.  my dad rocks.  fortune, smart money, forbes, kiplingers and some car ones.  cool.  the mwr center is open now!  it's so fucking badass.  big screen tv, like ten couches, gym, tables and chairs, food, smoothies, movie theater, computer room.  hella.  what the fuck does gubernatorial mean?  does anybody know?  arnold is so going to win.  alex, vote for arnold, not that busta fag.  it's cool when veins pop out on my arms.  hodge podge.  we still don't know when we're coming home.  GAY!  K-GAY, even!  i dont do anything of consequence here.  i sit around all day.  sleep.  read books n magazines.  play halo and other exciting titles for the xbox by microsoft.  i should be a salesman.  oh, and i get on the computer a lot and read about cars and look at my massive collection of pictures of jerika.  have you seen the one she's using on here?  jesus fucking christ!  it doesn't get any hotter than that.  hey, group vote, should i get my arms waxed?  i want to get my whole body waxed from the neck down.  i'm not especially hairy or anything, i don't have a hairy back or neck or nasty crap like that.  i just don't want any body hair.  jerika says no.  i guess she likes burly mountian men or something.  smooth skin is hott tho.  just feeling my whole arm while hairless (i was shaving them before this deployment) turns me on.  so anyways, yeah.  suck tho, the only people that read my journal are jerika and ally.  and i don't even know if ally reads it, i just say that because i'm on her friends list.  i need to be on more people's friends list.  jerika, recommend me to some folks or something.  my birthday is three months away today.  lance is a fag."

"event","hi!  turbochargers rock.  i'm totally thinkin rsx type s now.  $8500 for the kit i want.. it comes with new pistons/rods/sleeves/valvetrain stuff too tho.  supposed to be good for 450+whp at 25psi.  thasa lot.  there's no way that the new internals are the stock 11:1 compression ratio.  you'd have to have like 150 octane gas or some shit to run 25psi of boost at that cr.  one thing's for sure, though.. that kit isn't legal in cali.  i'll have to find some shady guy to do my emissions if i'm going to move there.  or maybe i could just stay a resident of texas somehow.  that really sucks that california has such gay laws about guns and fast cars.  what a shame.  in texas i can walk down the street with a rifle that in cali i couldn't even have in my house.  how gay is that?  how do i decide what LSD to buy?  i sure as hell don't want that grinding sound when i turn.  jerika never writes about me in her journal anymore.  sad panda."

M-4 carbine assault rifle, desert eagle .50 cal magnum handgun, prolly a .45 as well.  i feel sorry for the poor bastard that ever tries to break into my apartment.  oh, and lance too.  he's goin to feel the pain.  sucka.  muahaha.  i don't feel like writing any more right now.  so i'm not going to.  bad bye."

"event","holy shit, i should've been writing in this for the last seven months *hits self with blunt object*.  so my last entry had me leaving my old apartment.  i loved that place.  it was a fucking palace.  so lets see, that was january 28th.  on febuary 10th, i received a call telling me i was activated with the 628 forward surgical team.  mixed emotion there.  at the time i wasn't really thinking of the money i'd make, but a few days later that occurred to me.  SWEET!  that's basically what i thought.  so i drove to san antonio, helped pack up the unit's crap, and left for fort dix, new jersey to be mobilized on febuary 14th.  that was only supposed to take a couple of weeks, but we ended up being there until april 9th, at which time we were flown to ft bliss to work at wbamc, of all places!  fucking crazy.  it was really awesome being back in el paso.  i had forgotten how much i liked that town.  i miss the year i spent there in nursing school.  i really had the time of my life, although i didn't know it.  *sigh*.  ok, enough of the pussy bullshit.  so then on april 29th we were flown back to ft dix, with the possibility of being deactivated and sent back home.  on may 2nd, we were flown to kuwait.  lol.  so yeah, we were there until may 27th, when we drove here to baghdad.  may 29th we moved into where we are now, the old police academy.  it was uber shitty back then.  and TRASHED!  we had to clean it all up and whatnot.  now things have gotten pretty nice around here, with a/c everywhere, a real chow hall, free laundry service, and halfway decent internet.  we don't do hardly any surgeries, which is a good thing because it means soldiers aren't getting hurt much.  but it also means we aren't needed,  as we've already been here three months doing practically nothing.  there's a meeting at the end of this month... we should be finding out when we're leaving at that meeting.  it'll most likely be near the beginning of next month, which is great.  i can't wait to come home.  ok well that's about it for now, i'll try to keep this a bit more updated, yeah?"

he's not home right now and i really really wish he was.
i drank a lot of caffeine in hopes of staying up all night to talk to him. 
but blah. hes not there to talk to. i miss him so much.
not just him being at home to talk to, but being with him. even tho i havent had that many oppurtunities to be with him, the times i have been were some of the most incredible.
hes perfect. i havent seen him in so long. its getting harder not seeing him.
i hope he doesnt get mad at me for writing in here, i dont know why i am.
im really sorry if you do get mad. i love you so much, babe. 
come back and sit in my front yard and tell me you love me again, please."

      what now?  what happens next?  what will las vegas be like.. how will it feel to be 21?  how will it feel to die.  i've so much to accomplish.. how do i keep from wasting it all away?  how do i prepare for my future while still enjoying my youth?
      so i sat on the couch, being passive, listening.  too worried about consequences, no faith in myself.  i don't wear pajamas."

"event","i hurt so badly.  i can't even put it into words.  maybe it has something to do with me being so physically and mentally exhausted from all the kids and the swimming and the sun... i hope it does.  this feeling is way to horrible to persist.  i don't know what else to do... so i'm writing in here.  i can't do what i want and i can't make things the way they should be.  reality sucks major ass.  i don't like feeling like this.. i'm a happy person.  so many emotions are churning within right now.. anger, frustration, depression, confusion, love... i don't know what to feel.  why is it so difficult this time?  electronics can't properly expression human emotion and thought.  i think that has a large amount to do with it.  and there's the lack of touch, of presence... something that's vital to emotional health.  it's been proven that babies that receive no human touch whatsoever either die or become severely introverted.  but there's nothing i can do about it, the distance is just too great.  the means are there, but everything costs money... living costs money.  and money is something i don't have.  who decided to make it that way?  at the dawn of man it didn't take 'money' to live a decent life... you just lived.  you had a family, you caught and harvested your sustenance, you just lived. blah.  i'm a happy person... i'm not accustomed to feeling empty and depressed for long periods of time.. and it hasn't been long, but certain things are recurring, certain events are reinacted several times over... and seeing that happen is making me sick.  i wish i knew how to make it right with the tools available to me."

FUCKING AWESOME !  jerika's getting mad at me cuz i'm writing in my journal and not talking much on the phone... when she's the one who told me i need to write in here in the first place.... i love that dork.  so it's 11:30pm, and i'm in no way concerned about waking up in the morning.  jerika just promised to take a shower with me.  kickass.  this room is totally trashed... i need to clean it up tomorrow.  i'm talkin with ashley gohil right now on aim... he's one of the coolest dudes i've ever met.  he's got a O gauge in his tongue.... that's not why he's cool, it's just interesting.  blah,  time to talk to jerika.  i'm crazy about her... this journal must make some ppl sick.  lata."

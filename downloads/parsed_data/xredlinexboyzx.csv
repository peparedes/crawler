When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past - you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby...

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

When you say that you love 'em
And you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars
(You can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy
(I do it just cause I'm...)
Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know
I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can

See I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that - this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad...hey

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad

You don't wanna have fun

Well we all went to the Titusville Astronaut Duels, we wrestled
Rockledge, Cocoa Beach, and Astronaut. We spanked Rockledge, beat <br>
Cocoa Beach, and got a win out of astronaut too. The toughtest duel
meet this year was def astronaut. I def think I wrestled liek shit, but
I will be ready at districts time. I think Steven wrestled damn well
against the fisher kid. He had him stuck and the ref never called it.
That was some bullshit if I ever saw any. So now we are currently 8-0,
and kicking ass. It is going to be another undefeated season for us. I
can't wait until the conference, I am going to whoop that ass, all the
way til finals is over. A lot of people wrestled tough, people got
extra points where we needed them and other didn't give up xtra points
where we needed them. It was one of the craziest duel meets ever.
Almost every match it was coming down to the wire. It was CRAZY. But

"event","Just chillin in PC Support Class right now, finished my exam, I think I did pretty good, it wasn't terribly hard. BUt naywayz this weekend kinda sucked. We all went to the lyman tournament, in my opinion people did good, but there were hard ass people there, like kids that were 16th in the nation. WEll the worst thing happened also Joey broke his elbow. Things couldn't get any worse. We just lost our awesome 103 pounder. Hopefully he will be back by districts time. I didn't do too good at the tournament, but again it was really tough. Overall we came in 5th place, which isn't that bad considering there were such hard teams there. went to bed at 5:00 AM on sunday morning and didn't wake up till 2:00. I was dead tired, and I went to Wal Mart at 3:30 AM, I am friggin nuts. 
     Another plus is that Pat is getting his car back finally. That bitch is going to smoke all others. The REDLINE BOYZ are at it again."

"event","Well tonight was an eventfull night, first off all we have to wrestle
Atlantic. Every year we wrestle atlantic we can beat them, and in the
paper they make it sound like they almost kicked our asses. Well&nbsp;
I know I was tired of this bullshit, and so were a few other of my
teammates (Joe, Steven, Brian, Cory, Me, and a bunch others.) So
anywayz wqe all weigh in, everyone on weight. We step out onto the mat
and everyone gets out there and whoops ass in their match. Some should
have got a pin in their match, but as long as it's a win I am F***ing
happy. Then Onan(King of Stalling) gets on the mat and starts
wrestling, he is getting back points for friggin made up moves, I mean
what the hell. So then he insists on throwing his legs in on the kid.
He has no clue in the world how to use the legs. All it is for him is a
Fake Russian Stalling Tactic. Some Bullshit. Then Darron gets out there
and gets his first win, he stuck the kid. Then it was getting close to
my match so I started to warm up harder. Then Joey pinned his kid. It
was showtime, I was ready to get this shit going, I didn't care who
they sent out there, I as gonna whoop the shit out of them. They send
out this kid, and I shake his hand and start to wrestle pretty hard, I
hit a duck under, then I put in the legs ( cuz I have used them before,
unlike Onan), and I start hipping into the kid, and get him flat. But I
go outside the circle so I had to go from the Ref's position. Then this
kid does a stand up and I slam his ass, and he gets a point for me
slamming him. Then after that I pinned him in a Saturday Night Ride.
Congrats to Steven tonight too, he ankle picked the shit out of his
kid. Also Rhett did good tonight, even though he lsot, he still was a
better wrestler than Balboa, and he will beat him the next time he
see's him. Well that's about it for now, but all I can say is ""THAT""S
HOW FLAGLER ROLL'S BITCHES"" Duece Up, A-Town Stay Down"

"event","On Wed. we had a match against Deltona. There was a huge crowd at the
gym. It was awesome. We absolutly demolished Deltona. So just when I
think I want to quit wrestling beasue of cutting weight, I win, So I
want to keep going. I went out on the mat with the intention of ripping
my kid a new asshole. SERIOUSLY. I wasn't gonna ease up one bit .I
finally get out on the mat after warming up for like 45 minutes. I
shake the kids hand and absolutly go Buck Wild. I charge at the kid.
BUt then I give him a bloody nose so he has to stop and get it all
fixed up. Bt then in the first period I pin him in 1:24. The rest of
the team also was awesome. We had some people that should have won
their matches, but what can you do. All the practice, hardwork, and
determination paid off. We Kicked Ass.<br>
&nbsp;On Firday we had a match against Titusville, this team was going
to be a little better than Deltona. But they weren't goin to be a bunch
of puss's either. So before the match caoch gives us his pep talk to
get us all fired up. I was like ""Hell Yea"" Let's go out theere and kick
someones ass. So we get warmed up in the room while JV is wrestling.
I'm gettin pumped up and ready to go. We run out on to the mat, and get
our warm up going. Me and Joey are warming up really hard. So Joey has
to wrestle a girl. No big deal, she wants to wrestle, don't treat her
any different. So this girl and the kid I am going to wrestle are
watchin' me and him warm up. I am like shit they can watch all they
want. We are gonna beat their asses. The time comes, I run out on the
mat, just liek the last matchI bull rush the kid and kick his ass in 30
seconds or less, I don't know the exact time. But anywayz needless to
say FPC Wrestling Kicked Ass once again. Great Job Guys.<br><font style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"" size=""6"">

I still feel like my boo
And I can see it no matter
How I try to hide my boo
Even though there's another man in my life
You will always be my boo



Yes I remember boy
Cause after we kissed
I could only think about your lips
Yes I remember boy
That you were the one
That I said I'd grow old with
Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
I was there and you were my baby


It started when we were young girl
You were mine my boo
Now another brother's taking over
But its still in your eyes my boo
Even though we used to argue it's alright
I know we haven't seen each other
In awhile but you will always be my boo


I was in love with you when we were younger
You were mine my boo
And I see it from time to time
I still feel like my boo
And I can see it no matter
How I try to hide my boo
Even though there's another man in my life
You will always be my boo


My oh, My oh, My oh, My oh, My Boo

havin' the Greatest Most Wonderful Girlfriend ever, workin on Project
REDLINE, school, and wrestling, there hasn't been a lot of time for
writin' in the ol' LJ. But anywayz, school has been crazy. This is my
first time taking a college class (for Duel Enrollment)and it has been
pretty crazy, we write a lot of essays, but all in all it is a pretty
fun class. Gettin ' pretty good grades this year, so I am happy about
that. Now the famed Project REDLINE, well I think that is all l I have
to say, well maybe not. It has been crazy every day gettin' in new
parts and things to do to it. It will be the <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">HOTTEST, BADDEST, SICKEST</span>
car on the streets. Everyone ready to have a challenge on ur hands,
well don't be ready cuz it is gonna blow you outa the water. And just
wait till christmas time (U will see what's gonna happen). All I want
to do with Project REDLINE is find Mr. ""Three Gears Man"". This kid
thinks he has the baddest car on the streets, and all he can say is ""O
man all I have is three gears in my car"". Well let's think, why would
you only have three gears, O prolly cuz u blew the other two u Ass.
Anywayz that project is enoguh in it's own. Wrestling season just
started and it is already gettin' kinda crazy. This Friday is the
PreSeason Classic at 5:00 P.M., you all better be there. Wrestling
practice isn't what I would say has been fun, but what the hell I can't
complain it keeps me in shape. I finally got a new pair of wrestling
shoes this year, they are friggin' pimp. Anywayz been hangin out with
Nicole all the time. We haven't spent a whole weekend together in a
while, but it's all good. She is so great I don't know how lucky I can
get. First of all she is <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">BEAUTIFUL</span>,
smart, funny, good sense of humor, I could go on for hours, but this
livejournal doesn't need to go on for months now. Anywayz been hangin '
with the <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">REDLINE BOYZ</span>
lately, doin' what we do. Me and Pat went to D-Town and picked up
Halo-2, he played the shit out of that game. I can't wait till Need For
Speed Underground 2 comes out, I will be playing that game like every
damn day. Anywayz I am kinda tired and all, so I am gonna roll to bed
and watch some TV. Duece Up.</font>"

Then we all pile into Czar's van and roll to Wet n' Wild for the day. So we get there, and all get in and start goin' on some rides. Let me tell yo, I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY FAT PEOPLE IN MY LIFE......Do people look in the mirror before the put on a bathing suit. So we all have some lunch and go on some more slides n stuff.....Then we all head back to the van and go to the gas station o we can get some slurpees and some food. Then we get goin' home. So we all take a PHAT nap in the car. So when I wake up we are pulling into the Wal-Mart parking lot. Then Pat dropped me off at my house, and I came inside and was gettin ready to go to sleep and Trent calls. So I talk to him for a lil', cuz he is coming over. So I get up and he gets here with Anthony. So I Install his Intake in his Explorer. As I am installing the Intake, Pat comes over. So I finish the Intake, and that thing is BEAUTIFUL. So we start lookin' at Anthony's Sound system, cuz it isn't working. So u know how the REDLINE BOYZ can fix anything. So Pat figures out that it is the fuse. So Anthony's Wiring is so jerry rigged it isn't even funny. So everybody leaves and I come inside and eat dinner. Then about 20 mins after dinner is over. Anthony and Trent come back. Then Pat came back over with Jay. So me, Pat, and Jay dig into Anthony's system. This kid had enough wire in his car that he was gettin' yesterdays radio stations. LOL. So we start putting his system together the right way.  Then my mom tells me that his bass is  too loud and to  turn it down. Then we start to drive around and figure out tuning the amp. We park in the circle at the end of the street and some dude comes outa the woods and is like ""Excuse me, can u please turn that down, ur rattling the windows in my house."" This dood lives 2 streets away.LOL. So we drive around and fix it and come home. His shit is loud. Then we put it all back together and he rolled out. So did Pat and Jay. Then I talked to Nicole for awhile, like until 2:15.
Today I woke up at like 11:45, I woke up to Pat's Bass rollin' down the street. LOL. So we chilled for a lil and he rolled out. Then Trent came over. And we chilled. Then he brought a friend over. We went up to Wal-Mart to get some stuff to install his strobes. So then I started installin' his strobes and then Pat came over and showed us his Air Soft gun. I pelted Trent with it about 10 times. It was sooooo funy... I hit him in his finger......Then I kept on installin' his strobes. Then Pat left to go to the movies. then the pizza guy came and gave us the pizza and we talked to him for like 10 mins. Then we ate. And I go on the computer and talked to Nicole for a little bit. Then I finished installin his strobes. Then he left, and dropped off his friend. Then I finished cleaning the garage. And now I am talking to Nicole........So I am gonna go now........."

5:00, I mean I turn on the TV at 5:00 and they are like good morning,
and I am like damn not good morning, I haven't gone to sleep yet <font color=""#ff0000""><b>SHOOT</b></font>.
So anywayz I get outa bed and take a showa. Then I get online and talk
for a lil. Then I watch some TV. All I can keep thinkin' about is
gettin my new CD Player hooked up. But in order to hook it up I need to
buy a wire harness for it. And it is like 15 bucks. So after a while I
figure, "" Hey I'll see if wal-mart has one. So I ride up to Wal-Mart to
finde out that they don't even have one for the make of my car. Well
damn, coulda guessed. So I figure I will hit up Discount Auto and see
if they have one, Well as I guessed again <b><font color=""#ff0000"">NOPE</font></b>.
So I give up all hope and ride back home. And again I am sittin around
thinkin' about gettin my Cd-PLayer installed. So I go out to the car
and get my Cd player and start to push a couple of the wirs in the wire
harness, WELL that lasted long, I finally just cut the damn harness off
and do it straight. So I am doin' it all and the <b><font color=""#ff0000"">REDLINE BOYZ</font></b> show up, so i take a break from puttin the CD player in and talk to the <b><font color=""#ff0000"">REDLINE BOYZ</font></b>. WEll they are tellin' me about the fishin' trip they went on. Well u'll neva guess it, <b><font color=""#ff0000"">THEY FOUND A DEAD GUY FLOATING IN THE WATER</font></b>.
So anywayz we talk for a lil' while longer and my mom gets home. So
they leave to go to their mom's house, and I get back doin' the CD
player. SO after a while i get it all hooked up, working good and
everything. Then I have to untape each wire and solder it. So that
takes me like another lil' piece of time to do. Then I take the old
metal cage off of the old <b><font color=""#ff0000"">STOCK</font></b> radio and put it on the new one. Then I put the whole car back together and <b><font color=""#ff0000"">IT LOOKS AWESOME</font></b>....I love that CD Player.....The car is <b><font color=""#ff0000"">SOOOOOO MUCH LOUDER NOW TOO</font></b>......Well looks like I gtg take a shower and go to bed.

I roll over and go back to bed. Then I hear the door bell ring, so I'm

go and pull my car into my drive way from next door. And I start workin

"event","<STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>So</FONT></STRONG>.......... I haven't updated in forever, but anywayz. Latley I have been really really lazy and not doin' a whole lot, but I figure ""Hey I need that kinda laziness every once in a while."" Today I woke up and went online for a little bit and looked at some stuff for the <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>JEEP</STRONG></FONT>. I chatted for a little bit. Then I went outside so I could go mow the lawn and damn let me tell you it was hot as crap. I went out anywayz and still started to edge the driveway, cut down some branches, and weed whack. Then I started mowing the grass, and sweatin' to death. And I get the whole front done and the side and some of the back, and Pat and Goose show up. So instead of finishin' the rest of the back yard I go inside and shoot the shit with them for about an hour or so. Then they left and I had a chance to get the lawn finished. Then I got into a shower ""<STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>So I can be So Fresh and So Clean</FONT></STRONG>"". Then I layed around and watched some TV for a lil, and Goose showed up. So i went and got dressed for Ultimate Frisbee & Dodgeball. Then we rolled to McDonalds to get a lil' energy food before the game. Then we get up to the drive thru window and Pat 2-way's us and tells us to come pick him up from the house so he can go to ultimate too. So we get back to the house and Katrina (very cool girl) dicides to take him to ultimate. So we all roll to Ultimate and we all break out the <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>LAX</STRONG></FONT> sticks and start shootin' after that we start playin some <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>MADD </STRONG></FONT>dodgeball. It was crazy. So I am like the last one in on every single game. I was doin pretty good these rounds. But then I almost got smoked when Natasha used me for like a body guard and hide behind me. SO we keep on playin and Natasha gets <STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>NAILED</FONT></STRONG> in the side of her head. She took it like a champ tho. So all together it was a crazy game of dodgeball. Then we move onto Ultimate frisbee. As we are gettin ready to start pickin' teams I hear Grace say "" Hey Eric I brought you a Present."" I was tempted to say "" thanx Grace, But my b-day isn't for another month.""<FONT color=#000000>LOL</FONT>. <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG><FONT size=4>Guess who it was?</FONT> </STRONG></FONT>Well if you were there you know who. <STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>A certain someone</FONT></STRONG>. Ok. Anywayz Ultimate was not as great as other times b/c first of all the lights wouldn't turn on when it got dark, so we move over to the other field where there is a little more light. Then we get used to playin on that field a little and guess what happens. The <FONT color=#ff0000>SPRINKLERS</FONT> turn on. Yea just what we need. <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>SO</STRONG></FONT> we just stop playin' there, and Grace,<FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Nicole</STRONG></FONT>, and I go chill on the basketball court for a lil' and talk about what not. Then as we are leavin' Goose goes ""Hey look at this"" and slides across his hood. So He does it like 2 more times, the last times he does it tho, He puts a madd dent in his car. LOL. So I say good bye to <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Nicole</STRONG></FONT> and we leave behind Kristy. This girl is the craziest driver ever <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>OMG</STRONG></FONT>. She is like drifting around corners in the park. LOL. So we get on I-95 and she just takes off doin like 110 MPH. So we try to catch up to her and we can't. So we get to the Kangaroo to get some slurpee's and we come outside and Mr. Forte goes "" Hey Kristy were you the one flying past me doing like <FONT color=#ff0000>100 MPH</FONT>. So Kristy goes "" Yea, ME AND MARCUS."" I was like say what, ""You just rated out Marcus."" LOL. Anywayz it was all fun. So I got home and took a shower. And now I am gettin ready to go to bed. Bye."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So today, I woke up and got online and talked to Alex. I figure that I will roll over to <font color=""#ff0000""><u><i><b>SNEAK</b></i></u></font>,
but I start thinking about how much I really don't wanna see this
stupid guy that keeps coming to the shop and slowing our progress, so I
just don't go. Then I figured why not work on the Jeep. <font color=""#ff0000""><u><i><b>SO</b></i></u></font>.
Then I started to wash the Jeep, well don't you know that one thing
leeds to another. So I take the front wheels off and sand and prime and
paint the brake calipers. Well damn that def. took a <font color=""#ff0000""><u><i><b>LONG ASS</b></i></u></font>
time. Then I ran into like a million problems, like the jack I had for
the car wouldn't reach high enough to jack the car up, so I had to go
find random pieces of wood to put under the jack to raise it a little
more. Finally got it up high enough that it would work. 1 thing down 1
million to go. <font color=""#ff0000""><u><i><b>DANG</b></i></u></font>.
So after that, I take the spare tire and spare tire stand out of my car
(to free up some space). Then after that is done, I clean the rims.
Then I start cleaning some of the engine, so it looks nice. Well damn,
thats a hard job. <font color=""#ff0000""><u><b><i>OK</i></b></u></font>.
Finish that and put the rims on the car, now it is one whole car now.
Then I actually get around to washing the damn thing. So I wash the
car, finish that. Go inside and take a shower. Not 2 seconds later I
jump in the Jeep and go pick up Marcus, so we can chill. We get back
and bullshit around n stuff. Then we went back to his house so I could
get my shoes and I went back to my house and had some dinner with the
momma.So I am like <font color=""#ff0000""><u><b>SOOOOOOO</b></u></font> happy that I am going to see her. Well take another <font color=""#ff0000""><u><i><b>DAMN</b></i></u></font> guess <font color=""#ff0000""><u><i><b>UHHH NO</b></i></u></font>.
Pat and Chris roll over to my house and take me back to Pat's house so
we can all roll to D-Town together, and so I can see Alex. (The main
Idea of this Excursion). So I go online to ask Alex what room number
she is in and she is like ""I am in <u><i><b><font color=""#ff0000"">BIG</font></b></i></u>
trouble, so I can't see you. So I am like WTF. I made big plans to go
to Daytona and have the boyz meet her, but I guess we can all
say <b><i><u><font color=""#ff0000"">FUCK THAT</font></u></i></b>, because I guess I will <i><b><u><font color=""#ff0000"">NEVER</font></u></b></i> see her. So me and the <b><i><u><font color=""#ff0000"">REDLINE BOYZ</font></u></i></b>
and Chris roll to D-Town. I keep telling them that I can't see Alex and
they are like "" We jsut drove all the way down here for nothing"" And
you know what I agree, ""What the hell."" My whole day was centered
around going to see Alex and what is the one thing that I don't get to
do, Take a <b><i><u><font color=""#ff0000"">BIG PHAT</font></u></i></b> guess. So we go and ride around D-Town and bullshit, then I came home and chilled. I still can't beleive that <b><i><u><font color=""#ff0000"">SHIT</font></u></i></b> happened. I mean <b><i><u><font color=""#ff0000"">DAMN</font></u></i></b>
. I hate being mad, but I just can't help this shit
anymore. Yea I am kinda MAD here. Well w/e, tommorrow's another day."

So today for some reason I woke up at like friggin' 9:30. I get online
and talked to Pat for a lil' it, then I took a shower, and rolled to <font color=""#ff0000""><b>SNEAK</b></font> with Pat. Got to <b><font color=""#ff0000"">SNEAK</font><font size=""3""> </font></b>and
they were doing a girls window tints, let me tell you this girl had the
best body, like woa.... Her booty was nice too (lol)... So anywayz,
after the window tints we start working on the Camaro, so we started
off slow and eventually got slower and slower and slower, then the guy
left and things picked back up and we got our stuff done.... We ran
some wires, built an amp rack, and started carpeting the amp rack. Then
we sat around and bullshited for like an hour and a half, then we got
back up and started doing some more carpet on the box. Then my mom
calls up <b><font color=""#ff0000"">SNEAK</font></b> and is like, ""Is
Eric there,"" I mean come on, ya just doin't do that lol.... So she
sounded really mad on the phone, but she wasn't when I got home. Ate
dinner with my Aunt Ronnie and my G-Pa. Talked to my fav girl in the
whole world <b><font color=""#ff0000"">ALEX</font></b>. Can't wait till tommorrow, I get to see my girl <font color=""#ff0000""><b>ALEX</b></font>.....<b><font color=""#ff0000"">YEAHA</font></b>..... Tommorrow's another day.......</font>"

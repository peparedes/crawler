"event","christmas is coming and you would think everything would be all hunky-dory, but not this year.  i can't help but notice this being the first year that i was not looking forward to the holidays.  too many people angry in my life and i have somehow found myself stuck in the middle.  why is everyone so petty?  why is everyone so difficult?  why is everyone so ok with being hurtful pricks? so here i am,  stuck in the middle...

i have done the normal gift-shopping...i even decorated some of the house this year.  but, i still dont feel happy with the ""holiday spirit"".  


fuck everybody who thinks they are the only ones that matter.

"event","well, a lot has happend since the last time i posted..mostly b/c it's been i think since october since i last posted.   i have:

-probably drank myself stupid about 212 times
-gotten my x-ray license
-gotten my cat scan license
-gotten 2 jobs- one in x-ray(soon to be catscan) and the other catscan only 
-and currently am in sweden until the 19th
-celebrated my 24th b-day (today)
-coughed my brains out...i'm sooooo totally sick....colds can suck my ass
-realized how much i miss my friends
-told kyle that i love him.

ok, so it seemed like a lot when i was doing all of that, but i guess it doesn't really take up much space when i type it out....

NOW, it is quite possible that i have but don't remember...but they seem to see this sorta thing kinda frequently....soooo my question to all of my lady friends....have u ever seen ur mom naked?     

i don't think it's wrong that they have, but i don't understand why i am weird for not seeing it...i mean...why would i want to?


on another note...kyle's b-day has come and gone.  25 years old....wow.

we had a ""playboy party"" for him lastnight....it was ok.  everyone got dressed up all slutty like so that was cool....and we were supposed to have a stripper, but she never showed...even after she called to confirm!   so that kinda sucked a little..


we DID buy a stripper pole at spencer's tho...so that was pretty cool.   the house was decorated with sluttyness... =)

the night seemed to go by pretty quickly, but all in all it seemed like a pretty good party.    

i hope everyone had fun.

go back to new classes tomorrow..this should be interesting.  i don't know what i'm scared of more...physics and exposure or positioning with elby. hah

ummm let's see.

i found out derek dominion is back in town and was told he is more ripped than ever.  i would like to see him just for that reason...i mean..c'mon the kid is like 6'6 and was always in good shape...so i can't imagine him being huge now. apparently my friend jon(not v-ball jon) is dating a cheerleader chick from highschool and her sister is dating derek, so maybe i'll see him thru the grapevine somehow.  interesting....

i had a nice talk with keith about relationships...its always nice talking to that kid...and seeing him with his girlfriend makes me wonder..

after that we got to go into the freezer and see a guy who had died from drowining in a river and then being eaten by alligators....it was pretty sick and smelled nasty...  his balls were bigger than my head!!

weird.


so anyways...i have a lot going on these days...work, school,...valentine's day coming up,,kyle's birthday coming up,,party for kyles birthday(theme is still in the air)...keeping in touch with my long lost love erica <3

no time for myself these days, but that's ok...it'll all be worth it in the end

 

oh yeah...funny story:

so friday i was at clinical...positioning a patient to do a chest x-ray.   now of course, she has no movement of the side of her body b/c of a stroke she had a while back...so she can't stand.  no problem.  i try to do the x-ray with her in the wheelchair..but the cassette doesn't fit behind her b/c her wheelchair is too small.   well....now i go to ask for someone to help...which of course people look at me stupid until they realize that the cassette really doesn't fit.  anyway..to make a long story short...i'm paying more attention to what i'm going to do to the patient and making sure she understands what we have to do..to realize where i was in the room...  so i'm talking to the patient, turn around quickly to get something and i ram my face right into the tube head!  my mouth was bleeding..my lip got cut and was swelling...i pretty much knocked my ass out...   pretty slick

everything has been pretty good soo far...i've met a lot of really nice people...and i've drank quite a bit since i've been in sweden....i don't need this liver, right?

anyways...we came in to karlstad on monday and we were only going to stay 2 days, but why leave right away when there is an Exotic Fair on thursday, friday, and saturday!!  needless to say...kyle and i were quite intrigued and figured we would stay.

so last night i get all dressed up (i borrowed some black leather clothes from our friends roommate) and we went to the fair.

it wasn't really what i expected...it was smaller than i thought because it was inside of this entertainment complex (bowling, go carts, games...stuff like that)..anyway...they had a bunch of booths set up to buy toys, movies, clothes..all the fun stuff a perv like me would love...they also had a big stage set up, so about every 15 to 20 mins a stripper (guys and girls) would dance on stage...they also had an area sectioned off for a peep show..and another one for a lap dance...so of course kyle and i had a lap dance...but i'd have to say...it was just ok...the one i had in florida was waaaay better, but that's a whole different story...sooooooooooooooooo.....we pretty much walked around and bought a few things...got really drunk..and i'd have to say..not to toot my own horn...but i think i was one of the hottest ones there (kind of a nice change, but if ur going somewhere to see people all decked out in exotic attire you want to see some hot bodies!)...not too many people were dressed up...some guy acutally started talking to me (right in front of kyle) saying that he thought i was one of the hot porno stars...hah....and the stripper told me i was pretty...awwww     so yeah i was really drunk last night...to the point i woke up this morning still feeling drunk.. haha

so...we go back to gothenburg by train in a few hours and we'll be there until tuesday...so i should be home soon...hopefully these hurricanes won't blow the house away before i get back!

haven't done much with my life the past couple of months...worked a lot..

but now..i'm in sweden again...i'll be back on the 28th

we've been having a good time so far...we drank every night...the first night we drank with friends from Evergrey...second night...some people had a bachelor party type thing here, so Vomitory (i think that's how it's spelled) played here....they played 5 songs...pretty nice people for being death metal....and then lastnight...we had some friends from Moonlight Agony come over...we played drinking games and two of the guys threw up...hah    so far it's been a pretty good time.... kyle brought a volleyball with us, so we play outside of the apartment cuz we don't have a car right now to find a park...but it's still fun......the weather is BEAUTIFUL here, it's in the 60's....speaking of weather...i hear another hurricane is on it's way over to florida...someone should keep me updated on whether or not its gonna hit...BE SAFE EVERYONE!   

when we get back from the sweden trip i will have a few days before i start school again...i'm looking forward to it...i know it's going to be consuming me for awhile, but i'd rather be busy than bored..hopefully this is a step in the right direction for me.

so i hope everyone is ok...i'll try to update more on here..

by the way...some of our swedish friends let us know that there is a swedish word used in the English language...we looked it up and it's true...but has anyone ever heard of OMBUDSMAN before???????

TODAY is Kyle and I's One Year Anniversary!  awwwww...no definte plans, probably a nice dinner..but i just want to spend it with him so that's all that matters =)

monday my parents moved out of the house that we lived in for 10 years. i'm in denial.
they now live on rock island and sample..i don't remember the name of the development, but it's like the 3 left on rock island after sample and the place begins with an ""M""..???? anyway...the house is kind of weird...it's not really bigger than the old house, but it's 2-stories. The rooms actually seem kind of smaller...it's weird. The weirdest thing is that it's got a bedroom, NOT connected to the house..it's like outside, next to it, like a little apartment. They also have this huge ass fountain on the side of the house now...which is also kind of weird, but it's nice looking. It seems like a fixer-uper, but my family likes it and i guess as soon as they get more settled in it'll feel like home.

for all of you who are close to my family and know the animals...i have some bad news.
about 2 months ago my mom had Romeo(the coolest, and sweetest cat in the world) put to sleep. It was very sudden..apparently he had been losing weight really quickly and wasn't eating for a few days, so she brought him to the vet and there was some kind of problem, dr's really weren't sure what...but my mom didn't want him to suffer b/c she said he looked horrible, so he's gone. RIP little kitty...i loved that friggen cat.

and it's almost school time...october is coming up pretty quickly..i'm  excited to start..but nervous cuz i wanna be able to handle it...i need a WWED  (what would erica do) bracelet! hahah!!! 

ok..so i have to go run errands...hope y'all liked the update...bye bye

I woke up to find the house decorated in ""happy birthday"" banners and whatnot...i got some presents..went shopping...then kyle and i went to P.F. Changs for dinner...we'd never been there before, but it was very yummy.....and then we met up with my friend jessica who's birthday was also yesterday...the whole day was really nice....but u know what sucked....


i bought a drink at the restaurant..and didn't get carded....i went to meet jessica at coral springs ale house...got some drinks....and didn't get carded!!  what the hell is the point of turning 21 if no one even wants to see my i.d.?????!!!  hah


well anyways...i'm finally at that magical age...and i really don't feel all that different..oh well..i still had a nice birthday..yay for me!

it's been an interesting week i guess...i decided that i'm a little too pleasantly plump(but still have NOT done anything at all about it) boy is that gym membership i have looking tempting....anyways....kyle and i are going to a wedding next month..so i need to find a dress and kyle needs to get a suit...we went to the sawgrass mall to look the other day..he tried some stuff on, but they didn't have the suit we picked out in black..only blue...(he looked sooo cute in a suit!)...and i'm having a really bad time looking for a dress b/c i've never been to a wedding before..all i know it's going to be really formal...sigh..it'll probably take me the whole month to find something i like and that is tasteful enough for a wedding!

on another note....my birthday is on the 13th..so that's like...what...2 whole days from now!!! i'll be the big 21...it's about time...

today i do the ""birthday/easter"" thing with the family...tuesday i don't really have plans..i wanna go shopping and get my id changed, but that's all i have really planned...and on friday erica says we're going to south beach to a club called ""Honey""..i looked it up online and i think it's like 80's music??? what the hell do i wear to a southbeach club that plays 80's music??????!! if anyone has ideas or wants to help me find an outfit..lemmie know =) and then saturday is going to be my ""birthday party"" here...so that should be interesting..i hope people actually come, cuz that would really suck if i was all like...yay b-day party for me..while i sit here all by myself!! but umm yeah..so that's the plan

HAPPY EASTER EVERYBODY!!!

ugh...what did he do to me!?!

on another note...everyone should be proud of me.....i drove on 595 and I-95 today...anyone who really knows me knows that i absolutely will do anything i can to NOT drive on highways...so yeah...yay for me.

and...i would just like to say..it would just figure that i almost die driving on the stupid I-95 today.

so i'm leaving the airport..and i'm on my way to work...i'm driving on 95 and an 18-wheeler is on my ass...
now i would speed up..but i can't cuz there is a car in front of me which isn't allowing me to do that....i was just about to change lanes so that the 18wheeler wouldn't be on my ass anymore, but the car in front of me decides to slam on his brakes....and he swerves....and i realize he's swerving cuz of a friggen tire in the road....so i swerve...and the 18 wheeler swerves.....luckily no one was hurt....it DID scare the crap out of me(not literally of course)...but it just figures the one time i actually drive on 95 something like that happens....god i hate that highway

so...back to being all sad...

it's bed time...

i'm gonna go lay down..and fall asleep...by myself...:::sigh:::  3 weeks better go by quickly!

"event","Seriously, when it rains..it pours. <----just a brief description of my weekend. but it could be worse.

Why is it that everyone looks for someone to be with? People look for that someone special to complete that void of love in their hearts, because for some reason, without that love, life has no meaning..no purpose. I think it's funny how the majority of my single friends want a boyfriend or girlfriend and all of my friends who have significant others want their space and freedom. No one is ever happy..nothing is ever good enough.  I often wonder if I agree with the saying ""it's better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all."" When you love someone, you give them your entire being..and it just seems so effortless, because love should be easy. To recieve that same amount of love is the best thing in the world, but who out there is willing to put themselves out there like that without fear of getting burned? I guess if you love and lose..it wasn't meant to be, so does that mean that there is such a thing as Fate? Does everyone have that one person they are supposed to find out there? I wonder how many people out there really find that one person they were destined to be with..? So my advice to everyone..take a risk...if it doesn't work out..it only hurts for a little while, but you'll end up being a stronger person for it..and who knows, you just might meet some really incredible people in the process. If it does work out, well..you'll be glad you took that risk =) 

For those of you not interested in the love aspect of life and just want some booty...i guess go out and have fun like you plan on doing, just don't come looking for me...there's too many nasty people in the world for me to get involved with that lifestyle..i've got enough unstability in my life as is.

I would just like to say, I only started writing about all this b/c a lot of my friends' journals have been about people they ""love"" or ""loved""..and it made me think about a few things. I don't know if anything I'm saying makes sense, or that it is even the right thing to do..i just felt like typing some random thoughts.

ok..i'm done with my nonsense. See what happends to a person when they've had little to no sleep. 

I'm going to bed. Good night."

I'll be applying for school in a week and hopefully starting there in October.  I'll be turning 21 in April, so I have a feeling I'll be going out as much as I can before I dedicate my life to this radiology program.  My brother and his girlfriend just moved in with us, so I'll be hanging out with them a lot. Last but not least, Kyle and I will be dating for a year in June(ish)..we're both planning on starting on our ""careers"", so he'll probably be in Sweden a lot =(  which means...if i'm in school and he's in Sweden...what will become of us????

I have to wait another hour before we can go to the airport..where i get to wait for 2 more hours for my plane to arrive. After a 2 hour flight..i will finally be HOME!!! I'm really tired of traveling at this point..exhausted by it. I just can't wait until i only have to wait on myself to do things..no waiting on other people to do their work...no waiting on people to get ready...no waiting on people to wake up...no waiting on people for anything...and especially, no waiting on friggen airplanes!!! ughhhhh

the trip itself was pretty good..short and sweet..i was only here for 2 days.

the first day i was able to see all my aunts..2 out of 3 i haven't seen in about 10 years. I was also able to see my cousins whom i haven't seen just as long..so that was nice. Too bad my aunts are kind of feuding...getting together was nice, but they were fighting by the time everyone was leaving..oh well.

the second day..my grandfather got into a car accident..totalled his car. The car was brand new and fully loaded..i'm not sure what kind it was, but it was like a 35,000 dollar SUV..siiick. But..he's ok and that's all that matters =) afterwards..we went shopping in the galleria mall, which is a huge mall with the best stores. It's nicer than towncenter mall and with about 4 stories and a new addition with 2 stories....sweeeeeeeeeet. so yeah..i bought an outfit =) after that..we all went out to eat at this really nice italian restaurant..where the food is expensive and the dinners only fill a quarter of the plate..but it was still good.

and then there is now. sitting. waiting. still one more hour until i go to the airport and 2 more for the plane and then 2 more for my arrival in ft lauderdale. oh how i hope the time will fly..........

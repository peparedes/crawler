"event","Awww! Isn't the background cute?! I think it is. I haven't updated this thing in a long time. Been kinda busy, with Winter Break and all...Winter break was pretty fun, but I hate it when you know you have to write a research paper and the whole break you are doing fun stuff but can't stop thinking about major stuff you have to do during the week...ok, that did not make much sense. I decided I'm not going to play soccer...I love soccer, It's so much fun, but I'm just, I dont know, not having fun when I play. Everyone keeps asking me, ""Is it supposed to be fun?"" and the answer is of course it is!!! It's a sport, and if you like playing you're supposed to have fun. Oh well, I'm bored. I have a free period right now and should be writing my speech. Anyways, over the break, I did a lot of stuff. Let's see...after school on Wednesday I wen't home and slept and can't remember what else I did that night. Thursday...hmm, can't remember what I did then, I think I went to the movies with Adrie and bought a TON of chocolate and snuck it into the theatre. It was so much fun. Friday, oooo I met Amie at Barnes and Noble so we could work on our music project. We got some work done but then had to go to school and we had soccer practice. I hated soccer...Anyways, then I came home and went to see a movie with my little sister and older brother. We saw Are We There Yet? which was kinda stupid. On Saturday I wen't to the library to work on my history notecards...On the plus side, I got them all done. I totally forgot the library closed at 5 so me and my brother had to wait outside till our parents came...then something really FREAKY happened! This one weird looking guy came up to us, and sort of started stalking us. Then he went up to my brother and asked him for money. He was standing so close to him, it was scary. We ended up giving the guy $10, if we didn't give him anything who knows what he would have done to us. Oh well, so after I went and got some Chinese, mmmmmmmmmm and went home to watch some Seinfield. Spent the whole day yesterday working on homework and watching the Chocolate Obsession Weekend on the food network..ya I'm a freak. So it was fun, but now school starts and it's not fun anymore. We don't have school Wednesday!!!! I'm so happy! But it's not going to be that much fun because I have to work on my history research paper the whole day anyways. 
Please leave comments! Tell me if you like my background :)

AHHH! I already know I didn't get two proofs...so that is -20 already and then the other two proofs I don't think I did right and they were worth 10 points each so in other words...""Mira's dead""..hahhaha today was SO funny...this weird little subsitute was walking down the hall and sort of tripped or something and then he turned around and look at me and smiled and winked...IT WAS FREAKY! now I'm going to have bad nightmares about winking substitutes.....</FONT></P>

"event","Wow...so it's been a long time since I last updated this livejournal thing. Well, first of all, it's because my computer has serious issues. My mouse doesnt move so there's no use in even trying to fix it...I think my computer is messed up because there is chex mix, and candy stuck in the keyboard...and yes once in a while you will find a piece of chocolate or two hidden under that cute long space key. You never know what you find under that keyboard, there's a new surprise everyday! or whenever I get hungry...So anyways..I'm at school right now, on Meghan's computer because I already told you mine is messed up. I have 2 tests tomorrow...English and Math and I have a history thing due which I finished in class because I'm a good girl. So I'm just sitting in the hall watching people walk by. I HATE THAT! It's like a natural instinct. Someone walks by you in the hall and you have to look up to see who it is, and when there are alot of people in the hall, it looks like my head is bobbing up and down. And then I try to not look and see who the person that walked by me is and they leave and I feel bad for the rest of the day because I DONT KNOW WHO THE PERSON THAT WALKED BY ME WAS!! Ya, I'll just shutup about that...So earlier on in the day I was sitting at a computer in the library because, as I'm telling you once more, I didn't have my computer. Juniors and seniors were randomly coming up and sitting in the computer next to mine because they had an assignment or whatever and It's really weird because you never know someone until you hear them talk. So I was sort of listening to people's conversations...which I shouldn't have been doing because every other word was a cuss word and you know me and cuss words, we aren't very good friends. I KNOW!! MY DAY HAS BEEN SO INTERESTING...
Sigh...I think I should call my mom and tell her I can't go to practice today because I have so much to do...I think I'm going to go do that right now..There you go Amie Hsu, I updated it just for YOU! HAHA THAT RHYMES! (That reminds me of music class..listening to the guys make up songs, haha that was SO funny)
Good bye everyone!"

"event","Well, lets see. Friday night were the homecoming games...I had a horrible time there cause my sister was bothering everyone. It's sort of sad that she sits in the student section and I don't...I could see a lot of people whispering ""who is that,"" and pointing to my sister so ya.....Besides that, the games were really sad. I swear I was gonna cry...well, not really but it was sad! The guys lost my one point!! Anyways, last night was the homecoming dance. First me, Regan, Meghan, Jessie (her date John), Adrie, and Daniel went to go eat at Humphreys. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered this salad that sounded good but it turned out to be a big pile of spinach. Then the band there practically kicked us out because they wanted to play and we were sitting in their way...meanies. Then we went to the dance...""fasionably late"" by 5 minutes hahah...we were the only ones there with a couple of other freshman. I guess every year it is always the freshman that get excited about homecoming, but oh well...I'm not that excited about it anymore, it was a waste of time and made me feel sad for some reason. I don't like dancing so I guess I shouldn't go to..dances...hahah. ALEXA SHOULD HAVE COME!! sorry..it's 10 in the morning and I'm feeling kind of random.
Anyways, oh ya, I deleted the last entry Amie. My survey thing wasn't working, it didn't show the answers! I guess I'll redo the survey sometime, probably not..haha...Well everyone have a nice sunday!"

<P>Haha, I like inserting pictures. Anyways, I didn't do much today. I woke up in the morning and sat typing on my computer for like a ""few"" hours...and then I finally decided I should do something productive, soooooooo I cleaned my room. Then I took a shower and my mom decided she needed a few things from Target. Plus, I also needed some new notebooks and folders and all that junk. So I went with my mom, sister, and brother to Target and we were rushing the whole time because we only had an hour before we had to drop my younger brother at basketball practice. So it wasnt that fun. So now I'm home watching the football game and dreading tomorrow...</P>

We watched 13 going on 30, the Diary of Bridget Jones, and Napoleon Dynamite. Ok, Napoleon is the coolest person ever. We watched alot of cool shows on TV and watched all these dance tapes that Tara has. Then Tara's mom brought out the air matresses...haha, now that was fun!

We were waiting in line to get food and there was this creepy guy listening to what we were saying. It was really weird so we just left the line...That was an odd movie, I'm so mad! I thought it was going to be better. After the movie me and Callie spent over 5 dollars on this one arcade game :0! haha, it was sooo addicting, but I stunk at it. I think I got like 3 or 4 hours of sleep at Meghan's house. Oh well, it was fun. Adrie, Meghan, and I watched Saturday Night Live, talked, talked, and played the sims 2. It was quite fun until they started talking about scary stuff...I was so scared I almost cried and started shivering...it wasnt good. We talked about alot of ""interesting"" stuff...anyways, now I'm back home in my messy room. The house smells like onion and cinnamon cake because my mom is cooking, not a good combination. New Years eve is tomorrow!!! I think I'm going to go to Callie's house, it's going to be fun!:)I'm going to go play cards with my dad and brother :) fun! Oh, comments are very welcome ;)"

"event","Wow...I can never manage to keep one of these ""journals"". Well in some ways they are fun and sure you can ""pour your soul out to the people"" and all that stupid stuff... in some ways it is kind of relieving. Well, not really, actually I'm a perfectionist so a journal entry for me is like an english essay, I have to read over it and look for grammar mistakes and run-ons or sentence fragments. But I guess that's not the point of these entries. Hey, I'm not as talented as Amie, she has been typing in her journal for about....a year or maybe 2. You gotta say, that's pure talent. Oh, and dont worry, I won't put song lyrics in my live journal, I'm not like that people. Why not put something more interesting, something people will actually read...they've heard the songs, don't need to read the lyrics...wow, that was deep. Moving on...

Today was fun. Friends from Chicago came over last night. I feel bad for them because it's a 12 hour drive from Chicago to nowhere, I mean Huntsville. Well, we must be real special if someone drives 12 hours to see us :). So anyways, we went shopping today and I saw soooooo many people from Randolph at Parkway....I saw Chelsea! Alice and Meg and many more people I shall not mention. If I did mention their names and what they were doing...they would be embarassed for the rest of their lives. So I'm not the kind of a person to do that to someone, haha. So ya, I saw alot of people and went in alot of stores. Those after christmas sales make your head hurt, no wonder why I have a really bad headache. After that we went to eat in the little food court and whenever I passed by the Chinese place the guy would ask me if I wanted a sample of the chicken. It got annoying after the 3rd time...I was just going to tell him to stick the chicken up his bellybutton but I didn't want to start a riot ;). Then we came home and Callie called, haha I can't wait to buy a homecoming dress, we have to go together Callie!!! Then I took a nice long bath and ate some much needed chocolate. So you can say today was a fun day.

haha, Chelsea, you're awesome girl

Just three more quarters to go...Upperschool is soo hard, being a ""freshman""...I want to go back to Kindergarten and have nap time! It's soo much harder than middle school, and now grades actually count. It seems like all the work I did before doesn't matter and that makes me sad :(. Anywho, just one more day and fall break. I was supposed to go to Michigan with my dad and brothers to see the Michigan vs. Minnesota game but noooooooooooooo, I have to stay home with my mom and sister. I mean, it's going to be fun with my mom and sister, but I really wanted to see the game. Oh well, at least my dad will bring me back a Michigan T-shirt...hehehe, show my spirit! Oh and by the way, Alabama and Auburn both stink....just clarifying that. 

  The Sims 2 is the best game and if you think otherwise, than your weird. It is soo much better than the original Sims and I can sit and play for hours and hours. I know I'm obsessed but at least I'm not obsessed with Halo :). haha, during study hall, everybody plays that game and I see no point in it. Running around shooting people...sure, another one of those games (like we need more)..

  Well, this is the only day of the week where I have no homework. This is so great. I'm going to actually go watch TV! Wow, I never thought I would hear myself say that! Later"

Flashlight tag, campfire, canoeing, fast food, rafting, pints of ice cream (hehe), card games, friends, and wandering around doing whatever you want! What could get better then that! Canoeing was the worst part. Stupid wind pushed our canoe into a tree and we flipped over into the freezing cold water! But thats not the worst part..our canoe started floating downstream and we couldn't get it. Then finally the guy that worked there got it for us. It was horrible! But once you look back it, actually, it's pretty hilarious! hahaha

Really bored...No school today! Woohooo...Right now I'm watching TV and eating Dove candies

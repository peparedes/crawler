"event","I feel lonely. I'm home alone, and usually that is a good thing. Not now. What changed? Maybe it's because there is no other presence here. But that's wrong, there is many. There is the small bag next to the monitor, and the bottle as it's eternal companion. They never really help though. They just sit and stare as they try to get my attention. I don't want them though. They are the enemy. 

I am waiting for the mania to set in now. Tick tock tick tick tick tick. any time now. 

I've been taking sleeping pills every night for the past two weeks. They make me feel forgiven.

A touch would be nice. Some body to hold me... but now I'm being silly. Who would want to hold this sagging sack of sick flesh, crawling with maggots and filth? At one instant, I crave human contact. The other, I repell it. This contact in which I crave will be my downfall. Seperation, elemination, and lonliness. Those are my only options. Fight for the smallest goal. 

I'll walk through this life for a while more. 

Tick tock tick tick tick tick tick tick tick... any time now."

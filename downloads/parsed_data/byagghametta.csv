"event","So apparently I passed out around 5:30-6pm. Right before, my heart was thumping like a jackhammer, I broke out in a cold sweat and the world swam. I got sick to my stomach. I sat down, looked at the floor, and the next thing I know the husband is standing over me and I'm looking at the ceiling. 

My occipital region still hurts from the thump I don't remember."

Graduated nursing school in December. 
Studying for my NCLEX now, applications went in this week.
Moved from middle of nowhere NY to Corning Valley. I like it here.
This house is clean.
Two cats spayed last month, now they act like kittens.
Still breathing.
Still playing WoW.

May be more later, if I remember to open this client again.

"event","So, two nights ago, my apartment complex gave me both the best and worst birthday present ever. 

Simultaneously.

Around 11pm or so, I hear a huge racket coming from the parking lot. Concerned it's some drunk loonies doing stuff to cars, I head outside, ready to yell at them. What I find is my neighbour, a man I don't know and the property manager looking into the back of a truck that contains a large dog crate. Inside it are what look like a purebreed husky and a rottie of similar origin. The rottie is awfully wound up and snappish, but the husky looks very pleased with itself. I asked what was going on, and my neighbour tells me: These two animals, both fully grown, were locking inside the bathroom of the apartment next to hers. No one had been home for nearly three or four days now. The dogs have been howling and whining the whole time. Other guy was going to cart the dogs off and look after them, animal services wise, and neighbour was going to call someone to see if they'd take in the husky at least.

Property manager is asked by neighbour, as the guy with the dogs in tow drives off, if we can have a look at where these dogs were kept. Property manager agrees - he's got to go take pictures anyway, and as long as we don't touch, we're welcome to look. We hit the apartment, and immediately notice one of two dog crates downstairs. In the laundry room. It's half full of dog poo. I'm already upset, but the worst of it is upstairs in the bathroom. 

The blinds of the bathroom are shredded, the back of the door's almost dug through - the big dogs were clearly trying to get out any way they could. The whole bathtub is full of dog poo. Like, the entire bottom is covered in it. There's paws stamped in poo all over the floor. I see no food or water dishes anywhere - they'd been hungry the last few days too, despite the poo volume. 

I feel sick. This was the bad part of the present.

I make my way home, and hug my neighbour - she's a big animal lover (one of her two dogs is a shelter rescue) and just about broke down and cried on seeing that mess. I decide a little while later to share some of my birthday cake with her - it's not much, but at least it might help bring her spirits up a little. When I take it to her, she's on the phone with the owner of the complex. She offers the phone to me, but I decline. I get her side of the conversation - she's going to testify against the guy. Property owner is bringing him up on animal cruelty charges!

That was the good part. The dogs are going to safer homes, from what I hear, and the guy responsible is going to get booked for the property damage and the animal cruelty. 

The best and worst of humans in one night."

This is why I DPS. No one asks me things like that, they just go 'HEY you hit things! Come stab!' and I go 'OKAY! *stabstabstab*

Of course, I have a whole different wall: Being DPS means I am so easily swapped for someone else it isn't even funny. No one needs me. Ever.

"event","You know, I laughed at a buddy of mine who lives out in Vegas and works as a nurse when she had time off and went nuts because she felt like she wasn't doing anything, even though her days were packed with reading and other activities she didn't get to do much. I thought she was nuts, hating being away from work and everything it brought her, going stir crazy and praying for her week off to end so she could get back in her routine.

I'm not laughing anymore.

I've only been out of school a few weeks now, and I'm already feeling it - a need to get a schedule, do something. I cleaned my house, cleaned the car out and did the shopping already for the week. I literally have nothing to do (even though I have a ton of novels, textbooks and video games), and it's boring me to death. I have no focus anymore, because my free time is seemingly infinite in scope. I could do anything, and that makes me so indecisive it isn't even funny. I can't pick one thing I want to do from the ton of options available. 

I am going nuts. More so.

Down side: The weeks of no good sleep have finally caught up to me. I'm sick. I've clearly got a minor upper respiratory thing going on, and I may have developed a fever. Things are kind of fuzzy, life seems distant. This wouldn't be a problem if it had at least waited a day to come on - I have to do my OR rotation tomorrow, and if I'm being wracked with hacking coughs, they're going to tell me to get lost. Which would suck. I want to see peoples' insides! 

TL;DR: Yay grades, boo colds."

"event","Oh good lord, I need a way to sleep.

Ever since January's horrific cat attack incidents (in which I was mauled in stereo by two of my cats who were, in all fairness, afraid because I was howling in pain due to the maulings and trying to attack each other - I just happened to be in between them), I've had a difficult time sleeping with the door open and more than one cat in the room at any time. Unfortunately, if I try to kick one out and shut the door, whoever is outside tries to burrow their way through the door at high speeds for the rest of the night, which leads Paul to open the door and me to spend most of the night with my eyes awake, coiled like a spring and ready to bury myself in blankets as a sort of armor against claws when the girls go nuts again. 

This means I've not really slept well in like, a month or so. This last week has been particularly rough - I think the 4 hour night has been about the norm, which sucks, because I don't really function well on less than 7. Especially not with stress of exams, papers, care plans, clinical rotations and everything else school throws at me. The result is always the same at night though - I'm tired, I go to bed, and then I spend four to five hours staring at the ceiling and trying not to think about cat claws. 

Someone hit me with a mallet please? Just so I can sleep for one night?"

"event","I may be a cynic sometimes, but I am generally right.

Earlier this semester, the student lounge in campus center was reopened, containing a pool table, a series of cafe tables, a ping pong table, a stereo, two smaller TVs  and a huge projection TV. The TVs are each connected to a different video game system - the two smaller ones with an Xbox 360 and a Playstation 3, the huge projection screen one with a Wii (which makes for some really interesting Super Smash Bros Brawl, lemme tell you). There was supposedly someone from the college association watching the room at all times, which meant they felt they didn't have to chain the systems to the table in any way, shape or form.

Bad idea, if you ask me, but no one did. Now it's too late.

Last night, the Xbox 360 finally walked out the door. Now the lounge is closed because someone needed the pawn money or the Xbox that badly. I'm honestly shocked, given the complete lack of security, that all three haven't walked yet. I don't know why they thought it was a good idea in the first place, given last semester's huge spate of textbook thefts and locker break-ins, the vandalism and the recent stabbing incident. It's not like this place is exactly crime free, despite the signs that claim we've no weapons and no theft. 

Oh well, now none of us will be playing this stuff on campus anymore."

Anyway.

On the way home from said quest, I have to walk past the very large town graveyard. I'm looking at the headstones when The Idea hits. It's an Idea that won't fly well with cemetery owners, but one I think would just be the final 'ha ha' in a lifetime made of them. It was as follows: If I were to be buried - and I don't intend to, I'm bucking for burning rather than burial or dumping - I would place a stipulation in my last will that made it impossible to inherit anything from my estate unless there was a yearly tithe. 

Said tithe would require anyone who got anything to come down to my gravesite once a year (at Halloween) and place a lovely <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2008/07/08/lawn-zombie-sculptur.html"">Lawn Zombie</a> on it. It would have to remain for at least a week - for tastefulness' sake - and could be removed on All Saint's Day.

Failure to Zombie Tithe means my team of lawyers could sue to have my estate turned over to someone else, who would then be forced to tithe as well in this manner.

This whole thing is mainly because I want to see these things crop up in the graveyard. Nowhere else would be quite as spooky.

Things like this are why I don't have more RL friends."

<lj-cut text=""This Are A Cut.""><p><em>Your result for Which Tarot Card Represents Your Higher Self? Test...</em></p><h4>Death</h4><p style=""text-align:center""><img src=""http://cdn.okcimg.com/php/load_okc_image.php/images/0x0/0x0/0/10065882946535730316.jpeg"" width=""210"" height=""338"" /></p>
    					<div><p>The image of Death charging across a field on his spectral steed would strike fear into the heart of almost any man.  The appearance of the Death card has a similar effect on most people, though it really should not.  Whether you like it or not, Death is one of the most powerful cards in the Tarot.  Humans naturally fear the unknown, and so Death is our greatest fear since it is the greatest unknown.  The majority of us are unaware that our mind and spirit die all the time, constantly shedding old beliefs and acquiring new ones. It has been said many times by many readers: the Death card is not a card of death - it is a card of transformation.</p>
<p>In the Tarot, as in reality, Death is nothing more than a transition to the next level of life.  Whether you believe that a soul goes to heaven or back to Earth to be reincarnated, the fact remains that the soul lives on.  The candle is extinguished, but only because the day has come.  The river shown on many versions of the Death card is a symbol, showing that life will go on, no matter what disastrous things happen.  The river water will reach the sea, rise into the clouds, then rain onto the land to flow into the river again. Nothing is destroyed, because nothing can be destroyed - there can be only transformation.</p>
<p>The only real reason the transformation shown by Death is so catastrophic is because it is being held back, fought against by those too afraid to realize that change is beneficial.  Every change happens for a reason, and Death is a force like Justice in that it is absolutely fair.  It does not discriminate against one group and spare another - everyone is equal in the eyes of Death. So if big changes are happening in your life it is certainly plausible that you are the reason for them.  There's no point fighting death, it only makes things worse.  Like the Hanged Man, accept that change happens and let it do what it must.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Rider-Waite version of the Death card, and note the bishop on the right side of the image.  He is actually welcoming Death, because he knows of the great spiritual transformation it brings.  Almost all versions of the Death card show a symbol of resurrection or re-birth.  This could be the rising sun, an egg, or a sapling sprouting from the body of a dead man. All these symbols show that to progress in life, our old form must die, just as a snake sheds its old skin to reveal a shiny new one.  This is the message of the card: Death must be conquered by the regeneration of the soul, and he who knows this shall live forever.</p>
<p>When the Death card appears, big changes are heading your way.  Usually this change refers to something in your lifestyle; an old attitude or perspective is no longer useful and you have to let go of it.  While the Hanged Man was a card of voluntary sacrifice, the Death card is a forced sacrifice - but that does not mean that it is not for your own good.  Sometimes you cannot see how your attitudes are hurting you, and when that is true, the Death card is your wake-up call.  Death is not simply destruction; it is destruction followed by renewal.  Even though one door may have closed, another is opening.  Will you have the courage to step through?</p>
<p>If so, before you go forward, take a moment to look back.  Is there anything that you are carrying with you that is no longer necessary?  Let it go now, before you proceed.  Are your old attitudes holding you back, or are high expectations constantly disappointing you?  Cast them off, or let Death's watery energy wash them away from you.  Open yourself and let it strip away all that you no longer need - fear, revenge, intolerance.  Flowers cannot bloom if the land is full of weeds which choke the ground, and likewise, your spiritual enlightenment will be held back by doubt and fear.  Let them go now or risk having them painfully ripped away when Death inevitably returns.</p></div><p><a href=""http://www.helloquizzy.com/tests/which-tarot-card-represents-your-higher-self-test"">Take Which Tarot Card Represents Your Higher Self?

Am I an average, a normal, or something different? What were they expecting of me that I live up to in reality, given my history? What were they not expecting but they got anyway, regardless of my life circumstances? Which operational stages am I in? Is this good? Should I be somewhere else? Why am I not?

What am I, psychiatry? I asked philosophy, but the answers were all inconclusive. They can't decide if I am or am not. Neither can religion.

Moreover, why do I care what you think of me? Why do I want to be typified and boxed in by your specific conventions? Is this normal too, or am I begging to be categorized as something  more than I think I am? Do I have some unnatural fixation on your approval, on the whole? Should I care this much about you, psychiatry? Should I ask evolutionary psychology instead? Do they have better answers as to the what of my body and mind because they see my genetics as a carrier for what I do?

Should I even give a shit about this on the whole at all, given the fact I do not see a me in this mess at all?

"event","For those of you Avatards on my F-list, I have a hypothesis involving the true nature of the pretty Crown Prince headpiece that has shown up a few times (once in a lovely flashback involving two firebending buddies who look for all the world like they're practicing kicking one another in the crotch and laughing - Sozin and Roku - and once in moderny times, where it goes from Iroh's hands into Zuko's) and why, exactly the Fire Nation has gone to war and to general shit over the past hundred years or so. 

This hypothesis surfaced in a discussion of said cartoon series over Chinese food, the first serious meal I had eaten all day. I was light-headed when Paul and I got on the subject of the Crown Prince's hat, and consequentially turned the discussion from symbolism to something else entirely. I may have come up with something truly nuts. Something none of us in the Avatar fandom have considered yet.

Come with me on this, I have clearly lost my mind. It will be great funteims for all!

<lj-cut text=""Clipped mercilessly for those uninterested parties."">Okay, still here? Good. Sit down, this will take some explaining. The Crown Prince's headpiece, as previously mentioned, was likely added in by Bryke as a foreshadowing thing - Zuko is the legitimate heir to the Fire Lord's throne, hairpiece symbolizes blah blah blah. We all know this, it's practically bludgeoned into us by the series itself. The thing is, if you trace where the Crown Prince's flamey hat is at any given time, a strange pattern starts to emerge.

Start in the old tyme days of Fire Nation happy fun joyness, where Sozin and Roku are rambunctious teenage lads, bending each other up and down the royal gardens (in a totally nonsexual sort of way) and trying to playfully beat the crap out of one another as teenage males are wont to do. Shortly after their little happy friendship festival, Roku is named Avatar and sent off to see the world and bend it to his whim as only an Avatar can. As a goodbye gift, Sozin gives him the Crown Prince hat. Roku tries to give it back, but Sozzy isn't having any of it - a good friend needs a good gift! So the hat leaves the Fire Nation with the Avatar when he takes off to train with masters of the various other bending styles so he can yadda yadda. You know this.

The thing is, once the hat leaves Fire Nation turf, things seem to take a turn for the nasty. By the time Roku comes back, still a rational and kind guy despite being a freaking awesome butt kicking multi-school bender, Sozin is Fire Lord (meaning his dad is dead and gone, and we never really learn how...given the precedent set earlier by other family members, it may have been a political assassination) and he is considering 'spreading the happy fun culture of our people to other nations, with tanks and bombs if they refuse to accept our obvious awesome'. Where there was once a rational and rather pleasant guy, he is now homicidal and somewhat insane. This insane culminates with him leaving his so-called best friend to rot during a catastrophe just so he would have no opposition to his invasion plans. 

Sozin never takes the hat back, nor does anyone in his line. At least not to wear. I, for one, think it was probably hanging out with Roku's people, like Zuko's mom. This is mainly because it makes my crazy <strike>theory</strike> hypothesis work better than the alternative, and since MY THEORYPOTHESIS IS CORRECT AND YOU'RE ALL WRONG BECAUSE I AM RIGHTER, this is now the case. Anyway, I digress. Moving on.

The Crown Prince's hat ends up in Iroh's hands some years later, presumably through Ursa's meddling before she buggered off. No, he doesn't have it because he's the true Crown Prince. Shut up. IT WAS URSA. He has likely had the hat for some great measure of time now, safeguarding it and making sure it doesn't end up in Evil hands. He eventually hands it to Zuko, who as we all know will end up in charge of the kingdom. This is where people say the whole thing ends - a nice symbolic handing down of power to the next generation.

But it's far more than that! 

See, my hypothesis is thus: The Crown Prince's headgear is, in fact, a sentient artifact a la Dungeons and Dragons more interesting treasures. It has a distinct personality and enough raw psionic ability/ego to enforce the overriding of the possessor's own goals and nature with that of itself. Everyone who has owned this thing, while they have had it, has been reasonable, kind, loving, wise and friendly. Not to mention good tactically and really fond of tea (we all know Iroh's habit borders on 10 pots a day minimum, but Roku seemed to have quite the tea-drinking thing going for him in the past too - and since he's gotten it, Zuko has been trying to learn to make a good tea as well). The goal of this headdress? Reinstate itself to the throne of the Fire Lord with a suitable, young human host as the body under it. All it needs now is to shunt Azula and Ozai...with the help of the Avatar. </lj-cut>

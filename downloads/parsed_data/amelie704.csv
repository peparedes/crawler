"event","here is webster dictionarys definition of the delta: the alluvial deposit at the mouth of a river. that doesnt explain too much. but, what i did see on my trip to Mbam, an ecovillage three km away from Foudigoune, was amazing. maybe i shouldve paid more attn in the earth science class i took in seventh grade. but, even then, i dont think pictures or words could really describe the beauty of the delta. 
and then, there was the village itself. huts after huts that were built by the villagers themselves from the mud that they digged. and the endless rows of mangroves that they planted near the ocean to obtain wood. it was truly interesting to see a village that functioned simply from all the natural resources that already existed. 
i would like to go back to that village again. someday in the future to see its progress because it has so much potential. but, more than that, next time, i do hope that i can stay much longer and to actually do something real, something to make a change..."

"event","my adventures are about to begin...this afternoon, i will head off to saint-louis, a colonial city in the north of Senegal four hours away. well go to the gare routiere and take a sept-place from there. i am very excited since its my first overnight trip outside dakar. i am missing the islamic new years but oh well. then next week i will be going off to some rural village all alone and then via paris after that. woah that is a lot of traveling and visiting, but so much fun.
this week was a bit dull with too many classes in the same room at the baobab center. we did go out wednesday night for casey;s birthday which was fun. first we sang happy bday to her at the bar in english and she received a round of applause. then we went out to niani, a dance club, and they announced her bday as well as all of our names on the microphone...so that was exciting. anyways later i will write about my trips."

"event","today is february 11th. it marks my one month anniversary of being in senegal. exactly one month ago, i arrived at the airport in yoff. i remember getting off and wanting to see everything on the streets on our way to the apartment where we stayed for a couple days. on that bus, i really did not know what i was getting myself into or how this adventure would turn out. 
one month later, i am having a truly amazing time here in dakar, senegal. i really am enjoying the relaxing and laid-back life that i lead here. i have settled into my large, very welcoming senegalese family. i love never having to rush. i love the unity that exists within the house. and sometimes i hate to admit that i am having a good time here. after all, this is a developing country where there are so many hungry and homeless people. so many people who are looking to leave this country, but have no means to do so.
what is amazing is that from far away, dakar would be like any other place in this world. lots of traffic, restaurants, schools, vendors, soccer fields, cyber cafes...yet, everything is so different on the inside from the muslim culture to the form of education. and somehow things that are missing like traffic lights, hot water, laundry machines, elevators, they dont seem all that necessary. perhaps if those of us who have so much shared a little bit of their wealth, maybe the world would be a better place.
this first month, i have done quite a bit of exploring from visiting goree island to experiencing my first muslim holiday. and hopefully, in the next few months, i will start my internship and help the people here in whatever way possible. there is still so much to learn about this culture. and i guess there are some things that i have to learn and to understand and perhaps to accept."

"event","so far so good. i have skipped 0 classes and other commitments (well, sorta). today, i drove to food & friends. what an adventure - got lost on the way there & the way back. hehe. .oh well, at least i did get home safely. and honestly, isn't that all that matters? 

meghan cooked some fantastic dinner. yum yum yum. we had a nice dinner with a bunch of sisters and pledges. fun times. i missed gilmore girls, real world, and laguna beach because of the STUPID baseball game :-( but, i did have a nice van shift ride to the WWII Memorial with dave, my little, john, and heather. the fountain was off, but it was still amazingly pretty as always. everything looks so calm and peaceful. 

i need to go to sleep it's 2:14am and i have to get up at. . . . 8. yup, long day tomorrow too. but, i do have my favorite class, yay. and of course, my week is almost over. morgan is going to paris. she wrote how excited she is to go again to the place she has been in love with for so long. have i been in love with paris all this time too? i'm not sure. probably. after all, i always thought about meeting the man of my dreams in paris. hehe...

but, it is to senegal i go. and i can't wait to go study abroad. right now, i am ambivalent about my time at georgetown. i talked to kels tonight, and i realize that i am pretty happy here. everything is definitely not perfect, and there is much that i wish i had. sometimes, i'm lonely, sometimes, i need to be alone. but, life is never perfect, and i should be satisfied."

"event","i'm sick. it sucks. after six weeks of school, i've used up basically every excuse from 'i am sick' to 'my flight was delayed.' and now, i am 'really' sick. ugh. so, now i use that excuse again. does that even make any sense?

in the mail, i got the alumni newsletter from my junior boarding school. yup, not choate, but indian mountain. i can't believe so much time has passed since the days when i was forced to eat a 'no thank-you portion' of broccoli; when i used to go riding every day at Pond House Farm (the best days of my life); when lisa mitrokhin and i used to have pretend ice skating contests. time passes by too quickly. it's hard to believe that i am turning 21 in two days. 

sometimes, i wish i could go back, and i'm determined to return to indian mountain after graduation. pond house farm is no longer there. the people aren't all there. and, i admit, there are lots of snobs there. but, it's the place where i grew up . . .where i spent three years, but what seems like so much more and where i probably matured more during the three years than any other period in my life. 

by the way, speaking of horseback riding, i found a stable in Senegal. of all places, dakar has a 'poney club de hann.' yup, they have real horseback riding with jumping and everything. i can't wait! riding in senegal, how much better can it get?"

"event","SENEGAL next semester!!! yup, i made my final decision. interesting it will be, no shopping or eating out in luxury for five months. that will be a BIG challenge for me. although i'm sad that i gave up paris, la ville d'amour, which most people may think i'm crazy to have done, i know that going to senegal will give me a different perspective on certain issues and will introduce me to a different part of the world that i have never experienced. i am very very excited to live with a family in an Islamic culture and to learn to speak wolof. after that, i will have traveled to Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa. yay for going around the world! 

On another note, the weekend is coming to a close. i seriously need to study. last night was fun, i enjoyed watching office space & finding nemo with my friends and playing donkey konga's with moises and others. what a fun and must i say, addicting, game. it was amusing to listen to meghan yelling at moises to go home and get up from sleeping on the couch. but, we finally got a futon, so all is good. tonite was another chill nite spent with ryan, maura, and my roommates baking cookies and watching a movie. so, overall, i had a pretty good weekend with taste of georgetown, sams inn, the black and white party, and what not. 

The year started off a little crazy. I came back from florida excited to see everyone, but also apprehensive about a new year ahead of me. I had some problems re-adjusting and the whole incident definitely caught me off guard. and I still need to take care of it and part of me wishes i could forget, but i can't risk getting hurt again. But, in any case, I'm starting to realize that I have almost two months to go until Christmas vacation. time  is flying. 

I watched 13 going on 30 tonight. i wonder what i will be doing when i'm thirty. .. .here's what i hope for. .at least right now. ..married to someone i truly love, working at the United Nations, thinking about/or having a child, living in a place i can call my 'home.' hehehe. .you can dream anything, right?"

i am getting increasingly frustrated. and i looked up my schedule for the 1st semester. i have two exams on the second to last day of exams which means i won't get to go home until 12/22 that means i have less than a week at home before i go abroad. 
tickets to senegal from japan are $8000. not only that, but for some reason, i must go around the world instead of going over the middle east. so, i would have to fly to NY and fly to senegal from there if that is where i'm going to. i don't even know anymore."

imagine being incarcerated for twenty-five years...for self-defense...in fear of losing your live...for an unfair verdict...
i met david at CAG tonite. instead of tutoring, he told me his life story. i'm not going to recount his long journey, but his story was impressive because he is trying now to start fresh in this society after living in prision for over half his life. i don't really know exactly what is was about his story that touched me, but i think the realization that there are so many people out there who struggle for forgiveness and to start over. 
so, i probably should stop complaining or being upset over stupid little things in life. but, life is tough when someone stops caring about you. hopefully, one day, soon, i'll meet someone that dominick depicted in his entry. .."

This weekend was pretty unproductive. i tried (emphasis on the tried) to get work done. Friday, val and i sat and did work. we took a 10 minute break to stop by at the village A party, but i really didn't feel like party-ing so we really left after 10 min. then, i watched ""Something's Gotta Give."" good movie; keanu reeves is very attractive. Saturday, Ada came and i took her into town. then, i met up with tim and his friends. went out to dinner at dupont circle and felt kinda conservative hanging out with so many very liberal people. am i conservative? i guess i stand in the middle towards the liberal side. or i guess i could classify myself as liberal. i do agree with affirmative action, i am pro-choice, etc. etc. i am sad that i missed the walk today though. i should've gone. maybe the reason i'm not into politics as much is because this isn't my govt here. probably. b/c although i do live here, whether it's gay marriage or abortion, it all really doesn't affect me personally. but then again, that is never a reason to not take action or voice your opinion. and for some reason, now my US govt class interests me a lot. in any case, it was fun and i had a good nite. then, ryan and i came back here to watch one of my favorite movies: my best friend's wedding. i could watch that over and over again. tomorrow i have my phone interview with a potential internship organization. . . .i'm not nervous now, but i hope i don't mess up. last time, i had an interview early in the morning, the interviewer told me, ""good luck,"" at the end, and I said, ""Good night."" haha. well, hopefully that won't happen again."

"event","i should definitely NOT be writing in this right now b/c i have a history paper to write, a french test to study for, an outline for theology, and flyering to do for LEAD. but, okay, some things are impossible and i'm just not gonna get all of the above done by tomorrow morning. oh well such is life. and i just can't do everything. 
so today was a semi-good day. i went to the Library of Congress. it was so annoying; took me about 40 minutes to get a library card to enter. then, finally i sat down and realized there were no books around me and i had to fill out forms so they could go get the books for me. then, i started reading finally, but i lost all my attention. but, it was interesting nevertheless and i have to go back again. they have books on reserve for me - exciting! then, i had dinner with tim on capitol hill. very cool. except, at the end of dinner, i realized i lost my AmEX card. ahhhh, why do i lose everything??? i don't understand. i have to be more careful. definitely. (i'm not gonna try to list all the things i have lost over the months). then, i walked back to school only to stop and wander around town for an hour without realizing that the AT&T store closes at 8pm. ugh. but, tomorrow is finally vacation. i'm so excited. i wish i were going home. but, i guess tim's house is good enough :-) okay, i gotta really go. .  . .happy easter everyone!!!"

"event","i HATE being sick. and i am REALLY sick. ok, no i don't have a terminal illness or a disease, but i have a strong virus or strep throat according to the doctor. she thought i had mono so i had to get my finger pricked which hurt and watching my blood go into the little tube freaked me out. i can't concentrate on anything; i just want to sleep, but i keep thinking about all the classes i missed this week and all the work i have neglected. and health comes first obviously duh, but some professors clearly don't believe that. i woke my mom at 6 in the morning and i talked to her again today; i just wish i were home. i just need the attention and care. and people will probably say that i'm old enough to take care of myself, but sometimes that's tough, ya know? okay well, i will wish.  . .  .that the next time i write an entry .. it will be happy. . .and that i will be feeling better.  .. ."

"event","so, i had my first line meeting the other nite, this past saturday. i gave a quick speech about service and its significance in my life. i have a strong desire to help others who are less fortunate than i am. in recent years, the number of people who wish to render service has increasingly grown. why do people do service?
in america, one main reason is religion. coming from a society in which religion does not play that big a role, i realize that faith leads you to help others. others do it for the satisfaction.  as robert coles mentions in his book. is service a way in which people feel better about themselves by helping others? is it a form of self-fulfillment? if so, is that bad? there's no right or wrong to this question. if people were to render service with the sole purpose of satisfaction, then that would be bad. unless you serve others with a passion and true desire, service becomes meaningless. if people are to serve others with the right motives, then i think service is a means to bring people from different cultures and backgrounds together. people don't need to accept, but they need to learn how to tolerate. and one way of learning and overcoming this is by actually meeting people. prejudices and biases arise from ignorance. then, service gives us an opportunity to discover and overcome this ignorance."

"event","so i've had xanga for a while. . .but, i decided to start a new internet journal. i don't really know if i'll ever write in it, but this is the means of which i am keeping myself awake at 9:24am after a nite @ calvary. this was my first time @ calvary since i got back from winter vaca. i had a good time as usual & excited to go back again on tuesday nite. it's just such a good place to get away to. sometimes, being at a place like georgetown, you become so pre-occupied w/your work and everything else that you don't realize how fortunate you are and such and such...so yesterday before calvary was a little crazy for me. but, i think i'm recovering now. maybe, i've just being overdramatic about this whole thing, but i just have to organize & start off a good semester."

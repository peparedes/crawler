"event","This week is totally off to a bad start. Yesterday I got in trouble for like yeah...I'm not gonna say it on here and today I got in trouble for talking! We had a sub in math and she is like 100% wicked! The WHOLE class was talking and she sent me, Taylor, Brent, Eric, and Chelsea to the office - just us 5 and no one else! That's so not fair! I really hope she isn't gonna be there tomorrow...if she is I'm gonna die! We were like all laughing because of Brent and his breath mints so I think that pissed her off - but hey I'm glad it did now! We got progress reports today - I made all A's and then 1 B in social studies. Mrs.Muir said I have an 82 in her class but that's wrong because I checked it and I'm suppose to have a 91! I mean she is the math teacher, she could at least get my average right! But other than all that stuff I'm doing okay because I get to see Taylor at school! lol I love him to death! Oh yeah we're dissecting frogs in science and that's pretty cool (ha ha not really). Tomorrow I'm gonna have to cut the heart and it's gonna be so nasty! Ewww just thinking about it makes me feel sick! AnYwAyS...I'm gonna go so BuH ByE! - i LoVe TaYlOr!!! -"

"event","Well I haven't updated this thing in like forever...I've had better things to do than keep up with my live journal. Friday was pretty fun. Taylor rode home with me from school and we went out to eat at Joe's Crab Shack. Then after we left there we went to Wallie World (lol) to just hang out and stuff. THEN after that we came back to my house...and like I said, we did ""our thing."" And no it's not ""that"" for all the nasty minded people out there. lol right Taylor? Well Saturday and Sunday I didn't do anything but sleep...sleep...and sleep some more! Taylor was doing something on his bike and like messed up his leg :(  poor thing! Today is gonna be pretty boring too - I can tell that right now! I GUESS NO ONE HAS WANTED TO DO ANYTHING WITH ME. Just kidding...well really I'm not, but I am. Oh well who cares?!? Well I'm gonna go so BYE BYE! love you all"

"event","This has been the worst week ever! I'm sick, I have so much homework, and another thing I don't need to mention on here. Oh well if you go to my school (8th grade mostly) you probably know what I'm talking about - thanks to Jessica! Man...she doesn't know how many people are mad at her because of that, but there's a lot of them * I can say that! Well now to the good stuff...We have like 27 more days of school left (not including the weekends) and Taylor is coming over Friday! Yeah he's riding home with me after school, we're going out to eat, and then we're gonna come back to my house and do our thing (lol). So maybe that will be fun - well of course it will be because of Taylor! Well I gotta go so bye bye! - If this is Taylor...I love you so much! -"

"event","Happy Easter! Well, I haven't updated in 3 days...so here's some stuff that's happened lately. Friday night I went over to Taylor's house and watched 13 Ghosts. It was awesome and I had so much fun! No more details...but of course I always have fun when I'm with Taylor (or Mr.Porkchop to Rachel) lol. Most of this weekend I've been over at my grandparent's house - that was okay I guess. Last night I spent the night at their house and this morning we went to church. I had no clue who those people were - country hicks I can tell you that much! I missed Taylor so much :( lol poor me! I called him last night and talked to him for a while until my aunt from Atlanta called - but of course I had to call him back! I don't wanna go back to school tomorrow - school sucks. Well actually I do because I wanna see Taylor and all my other friends...but that's the only good part about it lol. I'll be so glad when it's over...Anyways - I'm going! See you all later!"

"event","Today was bad and I mean terrible! I don't really wanna talk about it but if you're one of my close friends, you should know what it is. We had the ARMT (Alabama Reading and Math Test) at school today and my gosh it was so boring. Tomorrow is the last day and I'm getting checked out at 11:00 after they're finished. Yesterday was good - I rode home with Taylor from school and then we went over to his house. It was so much fun! We watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and that movie was good...but of course scary too. What scared me most of all was when his dad walked into the house and the door slammed - I was freaking out lol! William told everyone he broke up with me but I really broke up with him. HeLLo - what's up with that? Yeah that was like forever ago too. Well I got to run - see you all later! I love you guys!"

"event","Last night was the first time Taylor and I did anything together since we started going out. We went to go see Dawn of the Dead and oh my gosh it was so scary! Every time I jumped Taylor laughed lol so I don't think it was that scary to him. It was more bloody and funny than scary - Brent thought it was right out funny because they kept shooting people. That's Brent for you though! If you're planning to see that movie anytime soon, bring someone along with you! Taylor and I heard these people going oh I hope everything in that movie doesn't come true - we couldn't help but laugh because I doubt it will. We had a blast! Well I got to go - see you all later!"

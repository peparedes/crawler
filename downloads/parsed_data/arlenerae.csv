"event","I haven't written on livejournal in quite some time.  Oh well.  I am now at home and will be starting work at the printing factory in a week or two.  It should be substantially more interesting there this because I can listen books and music on my ipod.  For the next week or two I will be organizing my room because it's a disaster.  On Friday I'll be going to my brother's social, which should be amusing because tons of people are going to it; a weird mixture of people in their twenties and people in their forties and fifties.  It should be fun."

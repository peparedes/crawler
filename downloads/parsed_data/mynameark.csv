In love, you feel the most alive when your partner is patient and never willing to give up on you.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was emotional, moody, and difficult to please.

Your ideal relationship is open. Both of you can talk about everything... no secrets.

Your risk of cheating is 100%. You are not suited for a monogamous relationship.

"event","ok so today was really nice.  I got up got to my classes, which weren't bad, on time to early.  Then i was off to lunch, by myself.  Which i really don't mind anymore.  Then i went to my last class.  Art history, which i almost fell asleep in.  But seriously how could you actually not almost fall asleep?  That is the question of the day.  Then i went and worked out with marc.  Twenty minutes on the eliptical was pretty damn good for it being the first time in forever.  It was really fun.  Jen should come with us next time.  

Then i had a very weird/interesting conversation with steve.  Very, Very, interesting.  Never in my life did i think i would have a conversation like this one!


ProAtNothing05: STEVE!!!!
ProAtNothing05: i have a dilema
lock6376: what is it?
ProAtNothing05: which intramural sport should i join broomball or sand volleyball?
lock6376: hhmmm......
ProAtNothing05: isn't that a big dilema?
lock6376: broomball is quite interesting, yet sand volleyball is sexy and exciting.......
lock6376: i couldn't say i guess
ProAtNothing05: come on!!!!
lock6376: lol
lock6376: can't  you do both?
ProAtNothing05: i don
ProAtNothing05: 't believe os
ProAtNothing05: so*
lock6376: ahh, well i imagine that sand volleyball is seasonal
lock6376: i don't think broomball is
lock6376: so if you want to be in a sport for an extended period of time i would do broomball
ProAtNothing05: ok
lock6376: otherwise is still stand by my statement that sand volleyball is sexy
ProAtNothing05: lol
ProAtNothing05: maybe to you i guess
lock6376: i think to every guy
ProAtNothing05: oh nice
lock6376: i don't watch sports, yet i've watched that on espn more than a couple times
ProAtNothing05: let me guess men's sand volleyball?
ProAtNothing05: all that sexy man candy
lock6376: ooooohhhhh!
lock6376: burn!
ProAtNothing05: LOL
lock6376: no, definitely womens volleyball
ProAtNothing05: sorry i had to type it
lock6376: I LIKE WOMEN A LOT!!!!!!
ProAtNothing05: not man candy?
lock6376: well, man candy is sweet and delicious
lock6376: BUT
lock6376: it doesn't have a vagina
lock6376: or boobs
ProAtNothing05: but some do have boobs!
lock6376: like me
ProAtNothing05: the vagina is a no go though
ProAtNothing05: sure
lock6376: manboobs don't count
lock6376: manboobs are ugly
lock6376: and hairy
ProAtNothing05: lol
ProAtNothing05: so true 
lock6376: yuppers
ProAtNothing05: but what if a woman has hairy boobs?
lock6376: then she is in the circus
lock6376: duh
ProAtNothing05: oh steve that hurts
lock6376: why? do you have hairy boobs?
ProAtNothing05: maybe
ProAtNothing05: you'll never know
lock6376: i don't believe you
ProAtNothing05: how would you know
ProAtNothing05: exactly you wouldn't
lock6376: girls don't have hairy boobs
lock6376: that's why
ProAtNothing05: some do
lock6376: thats how
ProAtNothing05: there's no standard level of hairyness for women
ProAtNothing05: s boobs
ProAtNothing05: just like the size shape and color all different
lock6376: maybe, but not as bad as mine are
ProAtNothing05: maybe not but maybe close

"event","My first week of college was not as bad as i thought it would be.  I seriously thought i would cry when my parents left.  Instead i prompted them to leave.  I was proud of myself for that.  In my classes there hasn't really been a lot for me to do.  I just haven't learned to manage my time yet.  If i can get that down I'll be doing great.  I did my first load of laundry and none of my underwear turned pink.  A total success in my eyes.  I have discovered racquetball and i do believe i am terrible at it but i do like it a lot.  My roommate is really nice and strangely karma didn't bite me in the ass or at least not in this situation.  There have been others but i think i'll leave them alone because it seems that every time that i open my mouth i get myself into trouble.  I really hope that if i gain anything from college it will be some freaking social grace.  I am entirely tired of sticking my foot in my mouth so often that the taste of rubber stays with me for a week later.  
    Anyways i've joined All College Band (ACB) but lucky me i still don't have an instrument yet.  Figure that.  I would like to sign up for an intramural sport or a club of some sort i just don't know which yet.  I really enjoyed having Teeny stay the night with me.  I just wish she could have gone to some of my classes.  I didn't even think to ask if she could sit in the non-full ones.  I guess that can wait for another time.  
    Today i got up at 8:30 and I had a niner.  Not exactly a great way to start out the day.  I then proceeded to get the milk out for the cereal that i wanted the night before.  Off comes the top and i get a whiff of a cheesey smell.  I think to myself that doesn't smell right but maybe it's just because i'm tired and i don't know what the hell i was thinking.  Anyway, i take a drink of it and i was correct in thinking that it was bad because IT WAS!!!!!  I am dumber than a box of rocks at times and that was one of them.  After intro to performing arts and calc. i went to lunch with Keri.  It was packed in Erie and all those people just always seem to be standing right in the way.  But the thing is they are just talking and doing exactly that.  BLOCKING THE WAY!  I'm not sure why the don't just sit down but they don't and i swear i almost started twitching.  Then I went to art history and almost fell asleep.  I had to take a nap afterward to be sure that i didn't fall asleep while walking.  After waking up at like 5:30 from falling asleep at two, I got some of my world poetry done.  Then I went to dinner by myself and ended up sitting with a couple of people that i had met when I stayed up for the host program.  They actually recognized me and shocked the crap out of me in doing so.  It was a little awkward but that's ok, they were very nice.  
   Basically that is all for now.  I'm not exactly the hot spot for excitement."

"event","How do I make any of this better?  Well by saying that I am a biased BASTARD!!!  I am encredibly SORRY that I said that.  I am biased.  It's just that every blond that I have encountered at my school was preppy.  I'm not saying that all blonds are like that.  I'm just nervous and I am terrible with words and people for that matter.  I really don't try to judge people at a first glance and I'm usually good at that.  When I talked to you, you sounded like a very nice girl and I find it very respectable that you work for everything.  Let me say again that I am SO SORRY and hope that my shear stupidity won't murder a friendship that we could probably have!!!!!"

"event","Today, was interesting.  At work I was laughing at everything.  Every single mistake, I would laugh my ass off.  These people came in and this boy had a kid on his shoulders.  The only thing I could think of was ""Look, that boy has a monkey on his shoulder!""  The little kid was clinging to the boys shoulders and I was being kinda mean about the situation in my head.  These people were on welfare and all I could think of was the monkey comment.  I was laughing so hard I couldn't stand it.  I'm so mean.  Thank God that day is over.  
Other than that my day was boring as hell!  Yeah!!

Two months later anthat d I still don't have all my thank you cards done!  Ah shit.  Oh well.  Procrastination at its best!"

"event","Going to Texas Hot with the boys was very fun.  I thoroughly enoyed when steve called himself partially retarded.  I don't agree but it was still hillarious.  I didn't make a fool of myself because, thank god I had a meal where I could eat it with a fork.  Yeah for forks.  Well I'm not sure I enjoy forks when I get stabbed with them or when people try to take them away from me because I try to stab them with them.  Anyways, I had a really good time eating out and watching the movies.  Even Punch Drunk Love which was a tad bit confusing."

"event","Today at work was a lot better.  Nobody pissed me off and I didn't feel like strangling anyone today.  Therefore, it was a good day.  Plus, I was able to keep the perma-grin in place today.  That alone shows that it was a good day.  Oh well.  I have to work tomorrow and we'll see what goes down.  

I saw a picture of my roommate today.  And guess what I saw.  Probably what I least wanted to see.  A preppy looking blond.  Oh joy!  I do believe that I am prejudice against blonds.  I tend to stereotype them as stuck up and high maintenance.  Hmmm, I never realized that I have no blond friends.  What a realization.  Well, I guess we'll see how it goes.  Only time will tell."

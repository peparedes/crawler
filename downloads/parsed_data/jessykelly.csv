apparently things are better than before because my last entry was pretty fuckin depressing. lol 

classes are good (except for makeup... i HATE that goddamn class) and i'm generally pretty happy. 

waiting room just ended and i'm already signed on to do another show. that makes me very happy.

i wish i had a job. i wish i had time for one. but i don't really. i miss having a lot of money.

and... i officially have an AMAZING roomate for next year! kim, my love! yayyy

so, things are better. they could always improve and they definitely will. but for now, i feel like i'm heading in a good direction."

"event","i hate to add to the other saddened journal entries, but i'm not as chipper as i once was.

somewhere along the line i lost myself. it's the scariest feeling in the world. im here, but something else isn't. i feel confused and obsessed and so anxious that it's making me sick. i never know what to do with myself and it's scaring me. i think i should stay away from certain things. it makes sense, but i end up staying as close as i can. why can't i let this go? why can't i move on? why am i allowing myself to get hurt?

so. 

i'm just here.

conscious of myself falling into some hole. it wouldn't be so bad if i wasn't aware of it happening. but i see it. 

i feel slightly different than when i left. more in the moment but still not empowered. 

i miss feeling in charge of my life. wow. that just sunk in. 

i want to change."

"event","Have you ever faught for something, faught for it hard, finally got it, and wondered what the fight was for?

Well I know what I was fighting for, but now that I have it, I see everthing differently. It's funny how that happens. 

I need to relearn how to speak up. Some how along the way I forgot how that's done. And to think... I used to be so outspoken. I just think I need to remember to trust... myself, the process, and you. (part of my affirmation, yes)

Oh, by the way... I'm home! I got home today @ about 6. Three and a half hour drive. Not too damn bad, but I don't suggest going as fast as I did. It was a bit much. Too bad I didn't get to stop in Boca. Instead I had to run home to see King Kong. BOOOO! Really wasn't feeling it. 

But I get to be with my crazy parents again. I get to see all my friends again. I get to be in this humidity again... yuck. 

If you're in Miami, give a girl a call! I need to find things to do in the next couple weeks. I'm going back to O-town on the 1st. ""Trip"" with my brother and sister in law. You know... gonna use my Universal/Islands of Adventure Annual Pass. ;) SCORE!"

gonna try to get a job tomorrow. my friend is gonna give a good word for me. awesome :)

so on a deeper note... i feel like i'm starting to find myself lately... again. lol i always said i needed to be kicked in the head every once in a while so that i remember shit. like, who i am, what the fuck i'm doing with my life etc. 

open invitation for everyone to kick me in the head every so often. in the long run, the kicks help"

(it's the life of every party) well we finish the game (we won!) and we're saying our goodbyes and ashley informs me that cute boy thought i was cute back. supposedly asked her if i was single. i say cute boy should give me a call. 

and now i'm home. i could go to another party tonight but i'm tired... im a loser i know. 

i spent all day making a gift for someone that means a lot to me. i hope he likes it. it's rather cute. :)

courtney gave me such a sweet card tonight. she means so much to me and i'm gonna miss her so much during break. we're having a girl's night (me, court, ash, and kim) when we get back. and justin can't go! lol

"event","""you might win some but you just lost one."" -lauryn hill

i was close to saying that. hm. what a great, concise, perfect way of saying exactly what i was thinking. i just heard this song today. if i had heard it last week things would be very different this week.

sometimes i feel like i'm cutting myself short. i feel how much potential i have to be great. it's not me being cocky, i can taste my dedication and determination so i relate that to my own successes. i've always worked for everything i've gotten. for some reason the universe never seems to hand things to me on a silver platter. 

when i get it, damn it's appreciated. 

i want something now. i really want it. i just want to live like i did last year and feel the peace i felt with prieto. i'm good and all, but that feeling of serenity was like no other. so i busted out my life 101 the other night. trying to recreate the past. ...or at least remember the tools i used to have. 

and i painted half a canvas the other night. that's insanely relaxing. 

i've been wanting to make a new treasure map. i lost my old one! :( christmas break, yall. it's getting done. 

since classes are over and finals are laid back, i'm actually relaxed. feels like yellow. coldplay knows what they're talking about. 

there have been moments of my life with so much clarity. i wish those brief moments were instead constant.

yummy. the intro to ""To Zion"" just came on. so yummy. that guitar makes me lick my lips. one of the best songs ever. i'm gonna go look for some jazz. that'll be the cherry to my auditory sunday.

what would i do w/o music? i think i'd be a very sad jew. 




oy vea.





hopefully i'll be hitting up the hookah tonight. i think natura has music on tuesdays. i had some strawberry, banana split, vanilla earlier. it was like a smokey bowl of ice cream. ..ok it tasted better than my description. 

love to all who are interested in my little life and read this far. big props!"

it was nice to be home and see people i haven't seen for a while. 
i have pictures up the butt and that makes me so happy. :)
i forgot how intense miami is (traffic, south beach on saturday nights, the yucky guys).
but it's still a great city and i miss the familiarity i have there.
i know every street and all the places to go.
i'm learning orlando, though!

got back and had the best night.
it was exactly what i could have wanted.
perfection. truly.

i'm getting mad lazy but lucking out.
i'm sure the laziness is going to catch up with me soon.

i have my show on friday! 
7pm in the theatre building... it's free!

COME SEE ONE ACT FESTIVAL!

i just found out today that coldplay is playing in orlando on skip's birthday! 
i...want... tickets!

i need to really learn to trust people.

and classes are definately picking up. doing wardrobe for ""the boyfriend"" which is just a bitch and a half but i gotta do it so i'm not gonna complain. i'm gonna start bringing my laptop and just going on the internet. my cell doesn't get reception in the theatre. grrr

and by the way... JAMSTER IS A PEICE OF SHIT! they're charging me about $40 for wallpapers and ringtones i never bought. and cingular says i have to dispute it with them. BITCHES! note to everyone: NEVER start with Jamster. they lie.

i've lost touch with people i never thought that would happen with. i'm becoming needy. i need ur phone call. why do i need u to call me? to validate my worth? i should know that i'm worthy and not need ur voice to prove it. but i love ur voice...

i wish u loved mine as much."

(cuz i was just mad) and he's like ""no not at all!!!!"" with all those exclamations points and shit (yes this was online) so what the fuck. my daddy once told me ""you should always make a guy come to you"" so fuck this dude if he thinks i'm gonna try so hard from now on. he needs to make this work if he wants it so much and his ass isn't gonna make me drive all the way to pembroke pines. fuck that shit. jess don't drive to butt fuck for booty.

Yup. Finite math. I figured I should get that shit out of the way. And ballet! It's been a while... lol All of my theatre classes were chosen for me. 

Met some cool people. Saw my BEAUTIFUL apartment! Getting excited. Not completely there. Don't want to force it. I would rather have it hit me. Auditions for the Fall season are Aug 17 and callbacks are the 18. So... i'm getting an earlier move in date so I'll have some place to live. If not, a girl I met already offered to have me stay with her. (Thanks Lindsey!) I'll probably end up going up the 16th or so. I was also thinking of rushing for a sorority, but I think i'm gonna wait if I do it at all. I dunno, those bitches are convincing! Geez. 

Anyway, I really want to enjoy these last few weeks down here. I wanna go out. I wanna see people. I want to enjoy myself. ...not just work and get shit done. But I gtg do some of that now. lol Laundry is waiting and I have work @ 5. :-/

Oh! My apartment has a full size bed and a walk in closet! Hell yeah bitches"

"event","so. hi everyone. i'm a bit lost in my life right now. 

gainesville didn't go as planned. it wasn't a good weekend. for many reasons not worth getting into on the internet. but i can't lie and say it went well. so i'm not going to. i really don't have a lying bone in my body. it didn't go well and it's a huge shame for so many reasons. 

so i've asked my best friends for advice on what to do. i'm taking time apart from him right now. took him off my buddy list, phone, pictures, all of it. it hurts like hell but it hurts when i think about him constantly too. so after a day of this, what do i feel? like i should speak to him. because i spoke with rach tonight and she helped me find some of my truths. that's what best friends are for. i still love him. i still want to try this again. i do.
Jesus dude, coldplay was on the ball when they say ""Nobody said it was easy. It's such a shame for us to part. Nobody ever said it would be this hard."" So Rach helped me figure out an idea. I have trouble communicating with him. It's something I just can't do for some reason. So i wrote what I want to say down. So I make sure it's all said. And i'm going to say it to him. But when.... I'm not sure. Not tonight. It's too late. But I feel it now. It's fresh. Maybe I should just call him. Nah. The words are still there. If the emotions are really there, they'll still be there tomorrow or whenever we speak. 

Guys, I wrote over a thousand words. I'm so glad I can finaly verbalize my feelings to him. I have them saved to my computer. I can read them whenever I want. It's a really powerful feeling. 

I simply want to try this relationship more. I want to explore more of what we have. I want to juice everything out of us until I'm satisfied there's nothing left. I still feel like there's so much more for us. And I can't sleep at night knowing that I'm not going to live my life and try. But I can sleep knowing that I tried. Even if I fail.

I love you. I hope you still love me. I never doubted that you did. I'm not going to start now."

"event","i miss prieto's class. i called her again today and again i didn't reach her. :( it's discouraging when she doesn't answer. She's probably in VA. She called me back last weekend and then I didn't call HER back. I wanted to talk to her. She's this parental backup support that ISN'T a parent. I love that. 

Rach and I said our affirmations last night and I almost forgot mine! I hadn't said it in quite a while. It's getting harder to practice all the stuff we learned. There's no 3rd period class or group of dozens of people to instill it every day. 

I need help! How do I keep it up cuz i'm losing it! :-/ Someone remind me of something, please!

In a few hours is Gainesville. 
Adam didn't work out tonight. I swear there's a reason things don't work out. Because again... i'm going to Gainesville tomorrow... lol

And does anyone else listen to iTunes on shuffle? Ok... don't think i'm nuts, but the songs that it chooses always coincide with what's going on in my life at that moment. iTunes is fuckin psychic. If you don't beleive me, try it. It's true. 

By the way, i love Natalie Cole. This is like the third time i've rediscovered her. I miss Jazz music. I went to a jazz club in the keyes and just... i wish i had it all the time. It brings something out of me. Something... jazzy?? lol I dunno.. it's super relaxing and I love it. And i've always secretly wanted to sing in a jazz club. Some day. ;)

Speaking of which... i really miss performing. And studying all that stuff we studied all the damn time. I'm really glad I stuck to it and i'm doing it next year. Summer's remind me of how much I love my art. I really do and i'm excited for fall and my conservatory! :) And I wanna keep singing. I sing in my car way too much. lol I miss voice lessons. I should get them again. I'm just soo fuckin lazy. Damn. We can't all be perfect.

And to conclude tonight's update, Gavin DeGraw is the shit. 

Thank you. I'll be here all week."

so on a lighter note, i'm leaving to g-ville in less than two days. i really am excited. i got a couple of gifts today! :) one for jason one for sam... my favorite gators. :) i hope u guys like! 

isn't it funny how a trip for two days gives me an excuse to go shopping? i spent like 70 @ marshalls (got the cutest things though!!) and 25 getting a pedicure. ok a girl's gotta look good, especially for someone special I haven't seen in a long time hellooooooo!

and... i dunno i wish people would start commenting on lj entries and writing their own more often cuz this is starting to lose it's fun. poops!

One of my goals is being met this coming weekenddddd! It was to go on a trip with friends and I'm going up to G-ville on Friday! I'm so fuckin excited I can't stop thinking about it. I'm staying with Jason (i love you!) and allison's staying with sam (i love u too sam! lol). I think we're going to a club one night and then finding other shit to do. But I get to see Jason, drive up and hang out with Alli and see Sam who i miss so much. I just have to get my car washed before we go... It's disgusting! (damn gables trees) I'm excited that we're taking my car for one reason alone... I get to show off my bumper sticker!!! Ok i understand that's a really retarded reason but you have to see it to understand. It's super super funny. Should I tell you what it says? Ok... :) Wow i've built this up a lot. Don't be disappointed. lol It says... ""My dog is smarter than your honor student"". Damn i built it up too much. W/e it's still mad funny ok!? 

I'm done working for the week. yayyy I love that I work three days and that's it. I made MAD flippin money this weekend. Holy crap. I know I had old checks and shit but when I deposited my money into my accounts it felt great. I might not have to take out any loans afterall. 

And... my mom just told me we might go to NY! I love being woken up to news like that. My mom's the shit. (not just because of that) She just is. Awww I just saw a picture of Sammy (my old cat)... i miss him and Tobey soooooooooo much. Awwwww I haven't thought of them in a while. Jessy's sad. Gotta go. :(

Went to the spa BITCHES!!!! My mom got my this spa package for my graduation and I decided it would be perfect to use right now. So... i got this awesome facial and swedish massage. Two hour long orgasm. Could i BE more content? sigh

So yes. Jason left. We're not together right now. I miss him a lot. There have been a couple of tough nights. Especially since i've been so stressed out. Last night he invited me to visit him for a weekend. It made me so happy that he invited me and i'm going for sure. Hopefully Allison and I can drive together, she'll stay with Sam and i'll stay with jason. We're going to ""partay"" and ""cuddle."" Who could find anything wrong with these plans? 

My parents are FINALLY coming home today. I'm actually waiting for their call right now so i can pick their asses up from the airport. Dumb asses missed their connection in Madrid. Suuuuure. They just wanted one more night of whatever parents do @ night. Uck. lol But holy shit am I happy they're finally back. I've been on house arrest for 11 days watching my grandma (who's back from the hospital after a two day stay), my dogs (one who just had back surgury... my harvey baby!) and this big ass house. So after working 50 something hours last week, i couldn't even do anything fun! Grrr. Ok they're coming back in a little bit and i'm freeeee yayyyy

I'm going to the Keys this weekend with my family. I'm actually excited. I wasn't before but we kinda bonded recently when my grandma got put in the hospital this past week. My sister's coming down tomorrow. I hope there's no drama with her and my brother but there probably will be. Too much drama for this lil mama.

What else what else... I just wanna see everyone again! I miss everyone and I haven't been able to make an effort to see anyone. So... call me up guys. I lost all my cell phone numbers and chances are if you're reading this, I would like to chill with you! :)

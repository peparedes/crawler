"event","i have abused drugs, booze and love, all at the same time. i have lived a sometimes terrible life. however amplified by specifically shining moments that glow steadily in my memory. and the avalanche of cursed nights and friendships torn to shreds is slowly forgotton, never lasting more than one season. lives ripped to pieces, souls that burn against you; true enemies now. how could the night have misled me so deeply, unreleased vision clouded softly with contempt. contempt for the sun and the comforts of dawn. <i>is it my eyes that have changed, or whats right in front of me. </i><br /><br />im starting to fade now, i feel it more and more. mostly in the mornings, getting my body to move. like a hollow tree base reinforced by cement, on the outside im blooming but im no more than bark on stone. and we only just last a season. i forget that; ephernal beings. we live lightly in the sun and sometimes in the shade, but we are only of the earth and must not plan to reach the sky before we fall back to the ground. when we all fall to the ground. drops of rain that come and go as quickly as they are made. and every drop of rain is a consciese thought; one for every thought you've got. a flash of lightning that you forget by the time the thunder rolls in."

"event","and you say you're sorry but its my turn.

im sorry for feeling how i felt. im sorry for waking up at 7 the other day to pick you flowers. and im sorry for untying the ribbon when i found out you werent coming and throwing every daisy away. im sorry for wishing i knew what to do. im sorry for being so desperate and not moving on when i knew it couldnt happen. im sorry for lingering so long in the same state of love and not moving on.

and moving on would be everything. because there wasnt a day where i didnt think about you. and for that i should say that im sorry. because every day is a long time to keep pretending. and im sorry that it wasnt hard for you. but im glad. i meant what i said, ""as long as youre happy."" but the problem is i guess i couldnt be. and i know that you know i wanted to make you happy. and that every day was a new day to find new ways to. but after awhile it didnt seem as fullfilling, and every day it occured to me that it wouldnt lead anywhere.

and 'id wake up to the sound of music'. and you know id hum any song for you. sitting by myself in the woods, id still sing for you. and im sorry. im sorry i went so long and wasnt afraid that you knew i loved you. and im sorry my concept of love has dissapeared. its not youre fault and im sorry for writing this, but sometimes i just need to say. and im so sorry that ill never see a beautiful flower, growing in the middle of nowhere, and not think about you and picking it for you. because i cant ignore that even the way i felt grew from the middle of nowhere.

need to say that it never made any sense and you were right. because i guess i chose to laugh with sinners, and as much as i thought i wouldnt miss it, id rather cry with you. because nomatter what anyone said, it made sense to me for some reason. it made sense to not stop missing you. it took forever, but i missed you the whole time. and we never had a single thing to remember, but i still do. i cant get over the ways that i cared and the fact that i cant anymore. ive been on the same trail for awhile and its left me lost and forgotton. and ive forgotton. or at least i wish i could.

and i know that ill drink more now, and i know that ill smoke more now, but whatever kills ya faster, eh? or at least thats the plan. but the sad part is, 'whatever kills ya faster' is sitting around hoping. sometimes hope is the worst drug of them all. because it never releases you and you always come back to it. come home to it. and coming home would have been so hard without you. thank you.

thats all i seem to want to do right now. keep thanking you. and i know that sounds weird and i know i dont make sense, but thanks. thank you for everything you let me do and every day you let me love you. because when i had that, when i could do that without worrying and you let me, i could do anything i wanted. i could accomplish most things with the thought in my mind that you were still there to care about. but now its time for me to pretend that i dont. and every time i see you online ill still sit there and hope that you say hello. and every time i still hope that you ignore the fact that i probably still love you. and probable love is unforgiving. it refuses to forget. but in a way i dont want to forget. because this has taught me a lesson. and you broke the mold. i know again that you know this, but one last time in words i must say, you taught me everything i know about caring. and you left me with so much to say.

from here on in i swear ill stop. ill stop writing about you and ill stop thinking of ways to tell you. because im tired of giving everything and being left empty. and im still sorry for saying this, and you know you shouldnt feel bad, but i needed a way of reaching an end, and this is all i could think of. i love you and you know that. and id probably be better off forgetting you exsist, but i swear i cant. but i swear im done. im done being empty and making excuses. im done pretending tomorrow somethings could change. and im sorry this is so long and that you had to read it all. but im just so sorry i had to even write it at all. take care and be careful, and ill always be around to remember loving you, even if you forget. and tomorrow ill wake up and be sober and forget you, just in time to remember you all over again.

and im sorry that im crying as i read this over"

"event","<P>life used to be so beautiful. life used to be so enchanting. and when that stops, all youre left with is pockets filled with sand and the sun in your eyes. and youre blind; hidden; forgotton; scared. you wake up in the woods and its dark. your little fire went out and youre swallowed by black. long black dark. it falls over your face and you vanish just enough so that the world can still see the glow of your tears and sweat. and you cant tell the difference anymore. pouring over your lips, they still taste the same. do they mean the same? you cant remember anyway. because you cant taste anything but the hard, hot night. the heavy night that comes and buries you forever because forever would be just long enough to forget how scared you were. </P>
<P>it was so dark you couldnt even tell if your eyes were open. <EM>and now you know they werent</EM>. and you walk through the darkness and you follow the trail beneath your bare feet, blistered and cut from walking in circles your whole life. and you listen to the crunch of the leaves under you, sticks that break in two and you break too. you break and fall to the ground and sweat and cry. because the hot, hot night is a blanket over you now and you stop breathing because youre so weak. weak because these circles youve walked have led you back and forth to the wrong thing so many times. you know its wrong; you scream its wrong; you cry its wrong; you drink its wrong; you break its wrong; you bleed its wrong. so you fall to the ground and curl into the dirt and wait for dawn. clinging to the rocks and branches that are the million moments in your life that kept you alive. youre more than a little too unsure that you'll never see the light again. to spend forever illuminating your world with the glow of your tears and sweat. </P>
<P>you think back to the days. as you hear the wolves howl around you, you think back to the days. the days when everything was beautiful. and you could walk through these woods. the sun pouring into the trees and the leaves. everything was so green. you think back to the day you walked past a blueberry bush, and something caught your eye. it was a lovely little butterfly, perched on a leaf. she let you get so close to her. a square of light shined on her from a break in the trees. you can see the millions of tiny little diamonds on her wings that shine and glow. this pure white butterfly, patterned with diamonds. but the closer your hand got, the more she spread her wings. and it didnt occur to you, over the beauty of the pattern that mesmorized your heart, that she would use them to fly away. but watching her fly away was more than the last touch of beauty you can remember in your life. <EM>and her diamonds sparkled in the sun and she shined in my eyes</EM>. blinding me. </P>
<P>but now the heat has consumed the world. the black. the long black dark. brushing over you; washing you brave. because it takes alot to not sweat when its this hot. even when you cant tell the difference anymore. does anything mean the same anymore? it all seems to taste the same. pouring over your lips, love and life and loneliness still tastes the same.</P>
<P><EM>""And butterflies are free to fly. Fly away, high away..."" </EM>.</P>"

"event","but some people cry. and the rest just dont. the rest of us just cant. and theres nothing wrong with crying. alot of people have to. need to. can. to come home from school and lock themselves in their room, fall into their beds and bite down on their pillows as the fall apart. but the rest of us, we're always just falling apart.

and no amount of crying will bring us to life. and when we close our eyes and think of all the miserable lives we've led, all that comes to our faces is a look of disgust and a ticket home from everyone we love. so we can just forget about them. crying wont help and we cant. but when we forget, however we can forget, we dont have to be alone with the tears. the tears that mean we love someone, the tears that say we need something, the tears that open us up and prove to everyone we turn to that we care. that we arent stone. but stone stands hard and firm and strong. it doesnt bleed. even when it doesnt have to. when theres noone to be strong for. when even we dont want to live or love or care or beleive. because we cant beleive. and beleiveing is nothing. seeing something noone else recognizes. seeing blindly in the dark. blinded by the millions of tiny worlds and bright stars full of wet eyes who arent afraid to be real or loved. but i, i am. im so afraid. because ive never seen into someones, someones eyes. someones eyes who loved me back. but ive seen hers. cold and black and brown and bright and beautiful. the eyes of the beleiver who beleived in everything but you. because you just couldnt love enough. you werent born to hold her. to love her when noone else would. to wipe the tears that she could cry and tell her that tomorrow she'll never remember what she was afraid of. because she could beat anything that crossed her. because i would be beside her, fighting even harder. but she'd still cry. because as they say, some people just cry because...because they have to cry. when everyone is asleep. asleep and soaked in the tears they have shed for us. not everyone does, but i wish i could.

i did. once. once i woke up and i was afraid. terrified. scared that my world had collapsed when it had. fearing a dawn that offered nothing but noone and noone but anyone who could wipe those dry eyes of mine. because i never had the right look on my face. because you could never pretend just long enough to reach out and touch everything that mattered. everyone who means anything to you. because you were nothing. you knew that. when those that cried said they loved you, you shrugged it off, had a shot, lit up a cigarette, pretended you were something else because its easier than being yourself. but noones and nothings never offered as much as the security of the wonder you had when she cried and opened up the tiny box full of escapes for you. allowed you to have someone who didnt know she held that key. because thats the only way it works when you cant shed tears. when you cant be human for a moment. because humans are too afraid to be something. something other than the moldings of a man, the outline of the somethings that you wanted to be but couldnt come near. because you couldnt cry. you couldnt breathe.

around you lurks shadows of friends who lived without them, tears that is, and they did fine. they strived and fought and battled and conquered. you couldnt. you fell so far. you pretended it was alright. that you would fix the world in the morning. but as you prayed for, morning never came. and neither did your world. her. she wasnt spinning with the moon, she was fleeing with the stars. the shooting stars. always beautiful, always memorable, touching, but you cant catch them. they dont come close enough. as far as you run and pray, they never come near you. it really is a hell of a night without it. without crying. because. because you need to forgive. not just forget. but you cant forgive yourself without forgetting yourself. and noone can forget without crying. because they never can escape themselves. the lightning striking in the distance. just close enough to scare you enough to lead you down the wrong road. escaping towards the darkness. fleeing away from them. because they never helped and never let you just be happy until they were. because she never understood that you deserved to be there. to shine on her and prove that you could be the greatest storm she ever fought. and that you would be worth the fight, that you would have been worth the rain and thunder. because your love was never watered down with tears. and hers were, hers was nothing but brown eyes, bright and beautiful in the stars. but you loved those eyes and missed them. she knew you loved her eyes. they still captured you. and would never let you go."

"event","its absurd. and preposterous. what a life he leads. ""Live fast, die young"" he repeated to himself. what a dull world bereft of pace do we live in where he speeds through so elegantly. without trying. ofcourse he never tries. because he never thinks about tomorrow. he never bothers to end a day with sleep. hes afraid to sleep. nothing but bad dreams. regret leads to nightmares. and sleepless days. life never seemed to go right for him. but its always been good to him. some how. its always been good. keeping him afloat in dark stormy seas. consumed by a thousand giant waves crashing in on him. waves made by love he threw away. the love who turned away. the loves whod laughed. and cried. drowning him. killing him. but still, he wakes up and smiles. ""You always have a smile on your face"" someone had once said of the man. if he doesnt smile, who will? he has such a good grasp. of life, or so he feels. that he could do anything if he even gave a damn. which he didnt. he'll run away. so far away that the curve of the purple horizon will block him from such a distance. but hed still hear them call. crying his name and missing that smile. but the world slowed its spin and he got such a hold of it.

the way the wind blew from morning til night. how hed only see some people at night. only at night. only seen in the dark dark of night. and some he would see in the day. the dusk. before he woke up. but he tried to keep in touch. just as best he can. he loved all these goddamn kids.

that he wrote about what he didnt know because he thought it might teach him something but he never learned. and he never learned. he just forgot. forgot the world. lost touch and fell from the sky. from space. so far away. he forgot how to love things. when he hated himself. and as soon as he did love, he hated himself. because he was a fool when it came to that. he was bound to fuck up. because you cant just give your love away. or at least he couldnt. not when youve spent so much time thinking. thinking about what hed do for her, if only. but it wasnt about to happen. and he knew that. but even moving on from nowhere is hard. hard to find somewhere. someone. because youll run to their love. your last touch of love from the sand. and love would only take you so far in the desert. it only quenches some thirsts. then they leave you dry. high, high and dry. but after all that, you cant just give your love away.

a fifty dollar fine for ""disturbing the peace (screaching tires)"". because as he desperately attempted to save his life, his tires screached before he wound up in the swamp. before he just missed that pole. which he missed. how he missed it. damn. hes in a swamp. its where he belongs. but maybe hell fight this one. for once in forever, hell try for something. maybe just to test some things. maybe just once.

but more than anything, he missed the way he could care about her, and just not care. not be afraid to think it or say it aloud. in a whisper. just whispers would do. which everyone knew. everyone who could hear whispers in that cold dark lonely night on the beach. by the sea with waves crashing on our feet as the stars lit up the sand on this forgettable night. it took forever to say. because it was forever. tonight was forever for him because he could be himself. but then himself was ashamed, and she knew why. and his jealously became sadness and loneliness and regret. loss. he missed his eyes in her eyes. the smile. those eyes. he loved her. he missed her. he hated himself. he wasnt slowing down. live fast. die. just live first. and as fast as you goddamn can. the moons chasing you. to say goodnight. fading brighter. and falling fast in the sand of the sky. broken dreams gleaming in tiny holes in the sky. the stars in her eyes. the smell. he still can smell it. even over the swamp scent.

he still remembers. does she?"

"event","maybe it was the way the music hummed through the cab. maybe it was how the on coming headlights lit up the backs of our heads and the tail lights were red lights that gently faded away. and maybe it was how the clouds came together and whispered sweet lies right into our eyes, and the rain hit the roof singing sweet songs to sing us to sleep. but maybe it was the way the dashboard light made your eyes glow in the night. mesmorizing my every sense; sense of reason; sense of consequence; sense of love and life and everything beautiful and bright in this dark world. but maybe theres no reason to have a reason for something as beautiful as that. and it was. trembling in the heat. to hell with senses. senses left me drifting in between forever. but in between had kissed me goodnight long ago, and there was no sense in lingering in a dark, deserted room. waiting for a light to turn on. maybe the only course of destiny and sanity is following a light. left lit, waiting for you to come home to. waiting for you to come home. but shining just as brightly as ever, nomatter what the weather. thundering showers, black clouds blocking the night. or clear bright skies, speckled with a thousand tiny beautiful diamonds, illuminating the ground as we dance in the glow. 

i have not been able to find a single breath of air not laced with a sense of guilt. every day goes day by day and slowly creeps along without allowing me to escape for even a moment. but moments give way to minutes and days and lifetimes alone. and every breath leads us further and further from each other. most days i dont want to get out of bed because i know that when i do, all that awaits me is the oncoming gusts from a storm i cannot manage by myself. and we learned we cant choose who we fight for.

so maybe i just wish i werent involved. with anything. or anyone in this world. maybe i just wish i was away. far, far away. never to be found or seen or ever heard from again. hiding in some secret cove, living out the rest of forever without a care or consequence or sense of anything. <EM>""It's kind of a special feeling When you're out on the sea alone Staring at the full moon, like a lover""</EM>. maybe the sun will rise and the flowers will bloom and the birds will chirp again and the sky will never fall on us as long as we're together. but maybe-

""Well what are you gonna do then?"" damned if i know. truth is, as much as i havnt planned on WHAT im doing for the next few months, years, i did plan on one thing: Im not just gonna stick around. i saw this bumper sticker the other day. it read: ""Just Because I'm wondering doesn't mean I'm Lost."" and thats me. sure, their are some people here i wanna stick around for. maybe even one id stick around forever for. but thats no way to live. and at least i know that. cuz if theres one thing ive learned here its that it doesnt matter who you love or why. that doesnt change the world. and for the most part, neither can you. all i can do now is change <EM>my</EM> world. because, yeah, it rains anywhere you go, but maybe it'll sound different over there. and i wanna find that out."

"event","i went to the doctors office today. while i was in the waiting room, no interest in any of the magezines the coffe table had to offer, i decided to just watch the people. Soon my attention was drawn to an old black woman sitting impatiently in a chair across the room. within a minute an even older black man stepped out of a check-up room and headed in her direction. he wore an old, faded polo with bright salmon colored pants. Something about his out fit was endeering and i was immidiately intrigued by the two. the old man slowly and painfully hobbled to the woman. she was immidiately alert to his presence and they began to talk to one another. i couldnt hear what was said, but whatever it was seemed to satisfy the woman and she began to gather her belongings. as she began to stand, the old man reached out his hand and she grasped it desperately. when she was elevated to the hunched over position she must always walk with, the man put his arm on her back, as if to tell her ""Its okay now. You wont fall; you wont break; I'll be here to take care of you like I have always tried to do."" and as the pair proceeded to the exit, I knew what it was like to love someone. and what it was to be loved. and i just wanted to find you and look into your eyes and let you know that i would be a strong arm for you when you needed support. when your steps slowed and your bones grew brittle with the years; when both of our smiles had long since faded and our only everyday joys were waking up next to each other. And when everything else in the fast paced lives we'd have led had vanished, we'd still have that. each other. and i would never let you fall and break. <EM>and when he woke up once again by himself he turned to where she'd be and whispered softly ""You are the greatest thing that never happened to me""</EM>"

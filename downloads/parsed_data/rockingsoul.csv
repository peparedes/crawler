"event","i am so good at making the best out of every situation, finding the silver lining and being content with that and moving on past the gray clouds. tonight sucked in, well, one big respect, but showed me that i have some good people on the peripheral of my life who are willing to be kind and caring when it would be easier to ignore and walk away. i guess i proved that same deal. hmm... you really never know what each day will bring, what lessons it will bring with it and which random friends will puke all over themselves, you, your crush and your favorite bar and leave you with bringing them home, on the edge of passing out, in a cab, cleaning them up and tucking them with the knowledge that they will wake up feeling <i>so</i> terrible in the morning... you never know. better get some rest so i can deal with the mornings affairs. who knows what is in store."

"event","i've been trying to find a black baseball cap. i want one to wear, like on sundays. just something plain, all black, no logos. i don't care if it's trucker-style or not. but, i haven't bought a baseball cap since middle school, and then it was a white, suburban boy-style one from jcpenny. so, i've been wandering into the stores i think should have a black cap for me, but have yet to find one after a good couple weeks of looking. it's so strange. i'm sure anyone else could easily find one, but i've never shopped for a baseball cap before, so i just don't know where to begin to look. it's strange when you do something that seems so new, like this search from a cap is. it's like when i went to my first dyke bar. i mean, it took a lot of asking around, wandering, searching and getting my act together before i actually could do it. 
it's amazing how my quality of life at work has improved since i got this envelope moistner from staples for 98 cents. it's the little things..."

"event","i've spent the best part of this new year with some nice kids who are so easy to get along with, so easy to be a fool in front of and so unafraid of letting the geek out. i love the company of folks that you don't even have to consider honesty around, it just comes, it just is. i realize that i've had so many 'friends' in my past (yes, read: former) that the whole relationship was such a task. now i know these things don't need to be. if i can't be the spazzy fool that i am in front of you, be honest about the things that turn me on and also the things that make me tick, tell you if i'm mad or ecstatic...then it is over and never should have been.
now i am caffinated and mellow all at the same time, only to arrive home to an overflowed toilet and no one home to help me clean up this someoneelse's mess. really, how could you leave the apartment without noticing that the toilet had not stopped running, was filling up with water and, left, would cause the whole of the bathroom and part of the kitchen to fill with pisswater and seep down into the basement? really, come on. so now, yeah. i'm trying to cool down and take a break before i continue disinfecting because i have to finish that before i can really move on with my life."

"event","if you ever have the chance to see the flaming lips you must, must do it. it is worth every penny, worth every second you will spend in their glory. i am so glad i ended last year with them. that is what they call going out with a bang. it was also quite funny to see ethan hawke in worse seats then me and very obviously 'on something.' however, it was kind of sad to see him looking so 'reality bites.' let's hope he can get his act together. 
i'm hoping that i can get my act together, too. my liver is quietly screaming about last night and my stomach is trying to recover from the massive amount of medium- and low-grade beer i fed it until about 7am. 
oh, i also highly recommend 'the life aquatic.' don't mind what others may say about it not being as good as wes anderson's other films. i think i like it even more. (i will be able to say that with more conviction once i've had some time to meditate on it and also to see it again.) it is visually amazing and the details, wow: acoustic david bowie songs sung in portuguese. pirates. bud cort. 'where did you come from? you look pregnant.' that is just a preview. again, worth the many pennies and the seconds."

"event","this story is for everyone that might not believe that matt and i aren't really friends any more...

so i'm at chili's last night with stephanie, her sister, and these 2 guys.  i'm at the table, and it's getting close to closing, so not too many people were in the restarant.  I'm sitting on the side of the table at which i can see everyone going to and leaving the bathroom.  anyway, i see this guy leaving the bathroom and we make eye contact full on.  Now, I'm a little buzzed, but i realize it's matt so i smile and he looks at me like a deer in headlights....
then he bolts...
then i go outside to soak up what happened while steph's sister smoke a cig and low and behold, matt comes running out...  again, he can't even say hi and he and his girlfriend run to the car and then fly past me and sam sitting outside....

so, yeah.... we had been talking before all this, even yesterday when i told him that i was going to chili's with steph...  he knew i'd be there, couldn't say hi even when he saw me... so yeah, we're not even acquaintences...  if we were, he would've said hi...

whatever, 5 years down the drain..."

"event","have you ever had so much going on in your mind, but no one to talk to about it?

it's driving me nuts, so i'm gonna out with it here....
...  my life is a mess right now...
i know it's my mindset that's putting me there, but the two people i got used to venting to, the two people that used listen no matter what, are gone... one physically and the other mentally...
but the physical one is another subject of it's own (by the way, whenever you do read this, asuming you ever go on-line again, i just want u to know i'm thinking about u and praying for u every night and day)...

back to my story...
...  my life is just a waste of time and my time is just a waste of life...  i feel so dumb...
i invested all this time, all my heart, and everything i had and now i have realized it was all a waste...  my heart bleeds and i've been told to put my emotions on mute...  i'm used to having a rock by my side and now i'm alone and it hurts...  i know that this is all for the best and everything will be fine (i mean there are parts of this change that i look forward to, namely finding myself and not some vision of myself), but i'm afraid that i will never be able to invest my emotions in anything again...  repeatedly i've been hurt and it seems like now my brain realizes the sting...  the worst part is, is that i've gone back and just got hurt again, it's like i keep getting shocked and i refuse to let the shock keep me from what i want...  why am i so stupid, so stubborn?  

life to me, right now, just seems like a waste...  i mean, i used to think the point of life was to love and now i realize that loving just makes you weak...  now here i am, alone and scared...  i guess alone isn't the right word, i have friends, some really great ones, but it feels like a huge part of me is missing, broken, hurting...

i know, i sound like a stupid immature brat but i had to let this out... you didn't have to read it if you didn't want to..."

school's hard and getting annoying, but i dropped a class today so things should be getting better...

work's good, but i'm not to sure of what's next.... i mean i love working at the pharmacy...  it's fun and i like the people there...  ok, the customer's suck, but that's gonna happen anywhere...  anyway, i know i'm gonna keep this job for a long time but i feel this timer going off in my mind telling me that i need to figure out what's next...  i need to know what i'm gonna be doing when i get out of school...  whatever, i'll shrug it off for a bit more...

my social life...  oh wait, i have no social life...  i mean, it's not like i care that much, but it seems as though i never have the money or time to do stuff...  well, i never have the money and the time i have is on the weekends, just i'm too tired on friday after getting out of work at 8 and saturday's when i get off work at 10 i'm WAY too tired to even think about getting ready to go out....  well, i'm not just tired, i'm sick right now and have been since the beginning of the year, but even that will be over with hopfully in a week or two (the worst of it is yet to come though)...

as for life, it's alright...  no major drama right now which is good... i seem to keep meeting guys which is nice, but i know it's not gonna lead anywhere...  it can't...  i don't have the time to even think about starting a relationship especially with the people that are in my life now... i barely have time for them and that's hard enough...

Virgo...
Although your intuition is still working on overtime, it also may bring up unrealistic concerns over little things that, in the long run, won't matter. But how do you separate the real worries from the imagined? This is the dilemma. There's no quick and easy answer, but the solution is held by sensual Venus. Trust her. Move sensibly toward that which attracts you.

You have everything under control one minute and just a few moments later, it's all falling apart. People are just expecting too much of you now. Can't they just be satisfied with the special perspective that you bring to the situation? Things are coming at you from both sides and you are caught in a web of contradictions.

anyway, the last two times we started acting more ""coupley"" i guess and then last night he asked me what we were and i (a person that HATES being put on the spot) just kinda went with what he said not going out, but not together i guess...
so today i'm walking to class and it hits me, i think i might like the ""idea"" of being with him better than being with him...  i don't know i'm so confused...  i mean, it takes me a long time to develop feelings for someone and he's a really great guy and he'd be soooooooooo good to me and i like him, but i don't think i want anything serious, but i don't wanna hurt him and i don't wanna reject him b/c i could see myself liking him...
God, i am so over this confusion crap!"

"event","last night was one of the craziest nights of my life...  it all started with jello shots and wine...  

then the stripper came.  he was hot.  i will try to scan a picture later and post it....  

then came the first bar where the bar tender took a liking to me.  he made my long island and then made me 2 shots to do with him...  

then we left that bar and i decided it was drunk dialing time... oh wait, did i mention we got an expedition limo to take us to the bars?...  anyway, then i drunk dialed steve and i knew i would never remember what the hell i told him...  i think i remember a miss you though but i MUST have been dreaming....

then more bars and more drinks and dancing with a real cute guy named chris...  then a garbage plate with jen at nick tahous...

then back to the hotel...  when we got there this girl named julie (must weigh like a good 350 easy)  yells out that she gave some guy head in the limo when we were at the bar...  the funniest part was that when we were in the limo this girl andrea said ""eww, did i just put my hand in cum?"" ...  we were all like, yeah right, it can't be... oh, it was..."

this weekend was cool...  i hungout with people from my work and matt and 2/3 of TEAM DRIZZLE...  i saw my first triathalon...  damn, that shits cool...  i have a lot of training to do, but i see myself definitely doing one...  i also played mini-golf with mike, steve, and blaze...  i even didn't get last for once (sorry Blaze!!!!)...  other thank that, life's been good... 

...  i have finally decided that i am not looking to get married or have kids ever...  that doesn't mean that if i fall in love i just won't go for it, but i'm not looking for it...  it's a long story that will be brought up sometime when i'm not at my job...

...  as for the future, thursday morning at 430am  the car service comes to get mom, jeff, and i to go to rochester...  we're going for my cousin's wedding...  i come back monday and have a test monday night at 7...  my parents don't get back until thursday afternoon, so if u'd like to be penciled in to sleep next to me for a night, u know what number to call.... anyway, i gotta go  i'll post more about my thoughts later..."

1) feel sick, so sick in fact that standingand talking is a chore
2) be bitchy and mean to any harmless person that crosses your path
3) turn your cell phone off so you can hide from the world
4) lay in bed and don't move all weekend, eventually someone will come by to see if 
   u are still breathing

I am so sorry to anyone who might have been hurt...  I know I broke a lot of different plans with different people this weekend but I was feeling and acting miserable...  I am also sorry to anyone who might have crossed my path this weekend, I'm sure I was a real big bitch...  Now, I am feeling better and I will try to make up anything I messed up last weekend...

so matt took my car to do some tune-upish kinda work to it for my birthday...  i knew about it because i was there when he bought everything for it...yesterday he took it to work and did it all...  after he came to my house to swap cars back, we decided to take it out to see how it was driving now...  when i got in the car i saw it...  my evolution into the 20th century (yes i mean 20th, not 21st)... i finally have a cd player in my car!!!!!!!  he got one for my for my birthday!  how awesome is that????  i've never had one in a car of mine until now! 

in other news, the underwear war rages on at my house...  it all started when we didn't have power and jeff's mom took some of our clothes to wash for us...  anyway, she gave us back some clothes and my mom asked me if matt had an teal underwear...  i said no and she said ""well this can't be jeff's""...  it's this pair of teal breifs that matt could fit into but jeff could never...  anyway, since i didn't take them, she decides to put them on my dresser...  i, inturn, put them on her outer doorknob...  she put them on my inner doorknob...  i throw them at her face when she walked by my room...  she threw them in my room as i closed my door to go to bed...  the next morning i hung them on her passenger side mirror...  i came home fromm the gym later that morning to find them on my ceiling fan and so i wrapped them on one of her shirts on a hanger in her closet...  by this time i thought she had gotten over it...  i go to climb into my bed taking off all my pillows and find them between my pillows...  i put them in her gym shoes this morning...  we'll see where the end up next, but if u got any good suggestions, leave them!"

Now, just because<br>it may be a little bit of a feminin color<br>doesn't mean you're all girly and whiney.<br>You're very self-less and love to bring good<br>news to people because you like seeing people<br>happy. You have better manners than most and<br>people love how polite you can be. You're<br>friends love that they hardley ever get in<br>arguments with you and can barely get mad at<br>you! You're friends and family mean so much to<br>you and it takes more than a fight to break you<br>away from them.

"event","tonight's the night....  my mom got my a hotel room for tomorrow so i can wake up with electricity...  if anyone wants to come chill, come one come all...  i don't really plan on having a party or anything but i would love company...  12 midnight starts my birthday celebration with an ashton salute!!!!!!!!!!!!!

oh yeah and here's a little story about last night...

so last night i decide to tough it out on my own...  this was the first night that matt didn't stay at my house and i had no where to go so i had to stay there...  anyway, still no power of course and i decided to go to bed early...  now, as most of u know i'm afraid of my own shadow...  anyway, it's about 230am and i get up to go to the bathroom and get a cold wash cloth b/c i was dying of heat (did i mention the shutters are still up?)...  i go back to bed and a bit later i hear this huge BANG!!!!!!! and i recognized it as my mom's jewelry drawer falling...  so i lay in bed trying to figure out if it's the dog or a robber...  anyway i hear some more noises and decide that someone's in the house... in my head all i keep thinking is ""do i grab my cell phone?  do i turn on my flashlight?  do i make noise?  do i hide?  do i pretend to be sleeping?""...  i didn't know what to do...  i decided not to move for a bit...  i didn't know what time it was or how long i was laying there, but i eventually grabbed my cell phone and saw that it was 515 and then i grabbed my flashlight and surveyed the house...  i finally realized that everything i had just experienced was because of the dog..."

"event","well, frances can suck my left nut....  it has taken me back many of centuries...  cold water, no lights, no ac, no tv...  mom and jeff won't let me take the shutters down bc pf the next one that is not neccessarily coming here....  some hurricane higlights...
1)  jeff coming home aftre raiding a quik-e-mart with a crate full of slim jim and vienna fingers and peanutbutter/cheddar crackers
2)  the cable going out 20 minutes right before the power
3)  going out in the middle of it to help matt fix my shutter
4)  the dogs being so fucked up off the sedatives that they didn't even bark once during the whole thing (thank God)
5)  matt finding out his house never lost power and him still sticking it out with me (when my parents even turned their back on me and stayed with friends)

that's all i can think of right now...  i'm in the lap of luxery at work right now...  i got light, ac, internet!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i don't think i'm ever gonna leave...  anyway, i gotta get back to business"

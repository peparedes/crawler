we lost my uncle kirk to it, but i never knew him.  one of the first reported cases of the eighties, he died just before i was born.  my grandmother still refuses to use the word...  aids.

i mourn more for my loved ones who have lost their mom, lover, friend, etc. to aids.  i mourn for the impact it specifically has on my ""community,"" the impact it has in other countries where it's killing hundreds upon thousands of people faster than i can even imagine."

"event","a few words, from mister michael moore.
(who admittedly gets on my last damn nerve sometimes too)

To All My Fellow Americans Who Voted for George W. Bush:

On this, the fourth anniversary of 9/11, I'm just curious, how does it feel?

How does it feel to know that the man you elected to lead us after we were attacked went ahead and put a guy in charge of FEMA whose main qualification was that he ran horse shows?

<lj-cut text= ""That's right. Horse shows."">


I really want to know -- and I ask you this in all sincerity and with all due respect -- how do you feel about the utter contempt Mr. Bush has shown for your safety? C'mon, give me just a moment of honesty. Don't start ranting on about how this disaster in New Orleans was the fault of one of the poorest cities in America. Put aside your hatred of Democrats and liberals and anyone with the last name of Clinton. Just look me in the eye and tell me our President did the right thing after 9/11 by naming a horse show runner as the top man to protect us in case of an emergency or catastrophe.

I want you to put aside your self-affixed label of Republican/conservative/born-again/capitalist/ditto-head/right-winger and just talk to me as an American, on the common ground we both call America.

Are we safer now than before 9/11? When you learn that behind the horse show runner, the #2 and #3 men in charge of emergency preparedness have zero experience in emergency preparedness, do you think we are safer?

When you look at Michael Chertoff, the head of Homeland Security, a man with little experience in national security, do you feel secure?

When men who never served in the military and have never seen young men die in battle send our young people off to war, do you think they know how to conduct a war? Do they know what it means to have your legs blown off for a threat that was never there?

Do you really believe that turning over important government services to private corporations has resulted in better services for the people?

Why do you hate our federal government so much? You have voted for politicians for the past 25 years whose main goal has been to de-fund the federal government. Do you think that cutting federal programs like FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers has been good or bad for America? GOOD OR BAD?

With the nation's debt at an all-time high, do you think tax cuts for the rich are still a good idea? Will you give yours back so hundreds of thousands of homeless in New Orleans can have a home?

Do you believe in Jesus? Really? Didn't he say that we would be judged by how we treat the least among us? Hurricane Katrina came in and blew off the facade that we were a nation with liberty and justice for all. The wind howled and the water rose and what was revealed was that the poor in America shall be left to suffer and die while the President of the United States fiddles and tells them to eat cake.

That's not a joke. The day the hurricane hit and the levees broke, Mr. Bush, John McCain and their rich pals were stuffing themselves with cake. A full day after the levees broke (the same levees whose repair funding he had cut), Mr. Bush was playing a guitar some country singer gave him. All this while New Orleans sank under water.

It would take ANOTHER day before the President would do a flyover in his jumbo jet, peeking out the widow at the misery 2500 feet below him as he flew back to his second home in DC. It would then be TWO MORE DAYS before a trickle of federal aid and troops would arrive. This was no seven minutes in a sitting trance while children read ""My Pet Goat"" to him. This was FOUR DAYS of doing nothing other than saying ""Brownie (FEMA director Michael Brown), you're doing a heck of a job!""

My Republican friends, does it bother you that we are the laughing stock of the world?

And on this sacred day of remembrance, do you think we honor or shame those who died on 9/11/01? If we learned nothing and find ourselves today every bit as vulnerable and unprepared as we were on that bright sunny morning, then did the 3,000 die in vain?

Our vulnerability is not just about dealing with terrorists or natural disasters. We are vulnerable and unsafe because we allow one in eight Americans to live in horrible poverty. We accept an education system where one in six children never graduate and most of those who do can't string a coherent sentence together. The middle class can't pay the mortgage or the hospital bills and 45 million have no health coverage whatsoever.

Are we safe? Do you really feel safe? You can only move so far out and build so many gated communities before the fruit of what you've sown will be crashing through your walls and demanding retribution. Do you really want to wait until that happens? Or is it your hope that if they are left alone long enough to soil themselves and shoot themselves and drown in the filth that fills the street that maybe the problem will somehow go away?

I know you know better. You gave the country and the world a man who wasn't up for the job and all he does is hire people who aren't up for the job. You did this to us, to the world, to the people of New Orleans. Please fix it. Bush is yours. And you know, for our peace and safety and security, this has to be fixed. What do you propose?

I have an idea, and it isn't a horse show.

Yours,
Michael Moore

"event","okay seriously, people defending fema in all this shit because they've seen fema help in the past is like asking a police officer not to give you a ticket on broad street because you weren't speeding on main street.  and president bush appointing himself head of investigational probes into the ""mismanagement"" of katrina is like telling a kid to grade their own test.  this shit don't work.
  
this nation was built on the idea that we always have the right to disagree with and hold our government accountable for that with which we do not agree.  i don't understand why so many people are just so complacent or have the whole defeatist ""well, it's been this way forever, it'll always be this way"" attitude, it just does not sit well with me.  it's easy to determine nothing will change if you're no longer asking questions or doing what you can to influence change.  i will, until the day i die, exercise my RIGHT to disagree with and speak out against elected officials, government agencies, etc. who are supposed to have everyone's best interest in mind and reflect our beliefs, when they consistently fail.  it's been this way forever because the american people as a whole have gotten lazier and lazier in every aspect of our lives and it would just take too much actual struggle to make sure the american dream is one that is accessible to ALL of this country's citizens-- people of color, the poor, the queer, the women, the children, EVERYONE-- and not at the expense of them.

and seriously, for everyone out there slapping their bible at someone else, and there's plenty of em out there in this lovely country i call home, i have this to say:  while you're preaching your psalms your matthews your corinthians please remember that nothing at all in that big ole book of your's means anything if you forget the ONE ideal that could actually make two shits of difference to mankind-- DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE DONE UNTO YOURSELF."

all updates from salon.com:


<b>Hurricane Katrina determined to strike in U.S.</b>
<small>Rush Limbaugh warned his listeners this morning that ""the left"" would find a way to ""politicize"" Hurricane Katrina. We wouldn't want to disappoint him, so here goes: Think Progress has dredged up a report showing that the Bush administration proposed to cut $71.2 million from the 2006 budget for the New Orleans district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. According to the report, the cuts mean that ""major hurricane and flood protection projects will not be awarded to local engineering firms,"" and that a study to find ways to protect the region from major hurricanes has been shelved. 

How much is $71.2 million? Enough to fund about nine-and-a-half hours of war in Iraq.
</small>


<b>Warning?  What Warning?</b>
<small>We made a little joke the other day. George W. Bush was in Crawford, Texas, in August 2001 when he got that presidential daily briefing that said, ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S."" He went fishing. So we wondered the other day whether the president had gotten another PDB when he was down in Crawford this August -- one that said, ""Hurricane Katrina Determined to Strike in U.S."" 

Metaphorically speaking, it turns out, Bush did get such a PDB -- and he got it years ago. Experts have warned for years that New Orleans is particularly vulnerable to hurricane damage. And as the folks at the Center for American Progress note, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a report in early 2001 that identified the three catastrophes most likely to hit the United States: a terrorist attack on New York, an earthquake in San Francisco and a hurricane in New Orleans. 

As of this week, FEMA is now two-for-three. That leads us to think that the residents of the city by the Bay might think about scoring some flashlights and bottled water just about now. But it also leads us to wonder what the Bush administration and the Republican-controlled Congress did with the warning that FEMA provided. 

Here's what: They cut funding for flood and hurricane projects planned by the New Orleans district of the Army Corps of Engineers. According to one published report, the New Orleans district had $147 million to spend on such projects in 2001. In fiscal year 2005, which ends next month, the district will have had about $82 million, a drop of about 44 percent. As we reported earlier this week, the Bush administration proposed further cuts for the district for fiscal year 2006. 

Would more funding have made a difference in New Orleans? We don't know. But we do know, from what we're seeing so far, that the president didn't make much of an effort. He'll be Johnny on the spot as he flies back to Washington today -- after squeezing in another night of vacation and goofing around with a guitar -- and we're sure to see him looking presidential as he chums it up with rescue workers in Louisiana at some point in the next few days. We've seen this movie before. 

The president is a great one for delivering the ""I care"" message after disaster strikes. He's even pretty good at doing the Chicken Little about threats -- Iraq, the bankruptcy of Social Security -- that aren't quite as serious as he makes them out to be. But it would be nice if, just once, the president, confronted with real warnings about a serious threat, could actually bring himself to do something before it's too late. </small>

and the most disgusting by far...

<b>Is Katrina God's punishment for abortion?</b>
<img src= ""http://www.salon.com/ent/col/fix/2005/08/30/tue/story.gif"" /> 
<small>We knew this was coming. 

Two days after 9/11, Jerry Falwell took to the airwaves to proclaim that God had allowed the United States to be attacked because ""the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians"" had tried to transform America into a secular society. Just this weekend, wingnuts from the Westboro Baptist Church turned out at the funerals of two fallen soldiers to say that God is punishing the United States in Iraq for its tolerance of homosexuality back home. 

So when Hurricane Katrina hit land yesterday, we knew it was only a matter of time before we'd be hearing from the lunatic fringe again. And now, here it is. In an e-mail message we just received, a group calling itself Columbia Christians for Life alerts us to the fact that a satellite image of Hurricane Katrina as it hit the Gulf Coast Monday looks just like a six-week-old fetus. 

""The image of the hurricane ... with its eye already ashore at 12:32 p.m. Monday, August 29, looks like a fetus (unborn human baby) facing to the left (west) in the womb, in the early weeks of gestation (approx. 6 weeks),"" the e-mail message says. ""Even the orange color of the image is reminiscent of a commonly used pro-life picture of early prenatal development."" 

And in case you're not getting the point, the e-mail message spells it out in black and white: ""Louisiana has 10 child-murder-by-abortion centers,"" the groups says, and ""five are in New Orleans."" 

But why would God single out Louisiana? Other states have many more abortion clinics, and Louisiana and the other states hit hardest by Katrina all voted for the pro-life president of the United States. It didn't add up for us at first, but the Columbia Christians for Life have an answer for everything. God has already punished California with earthquakes, forest fires and mudslides; New York with 9/11; and Florida with Hurricanes Bonnie, Charley, Frances, Ivan, Jeanne and the early version of Katrina.

"event","i can't stop looking at pictures and reading about the gulf coast right now.  i just can't even wrap my head around it.  people are focusing on new orleans, but that shit was huge and even my family got gusts over 65 mph, a huge fucking storm surge, more damage on top of the damage no one has even had time, money and energy to repair.  the beach is gone again.  

but i really fucking feel for folks on the louisiana/mississippi gulf coast and it really fucking sucks having watched my own hometown get blown away and forgotten about last year, knowing now that the media will only talk about this for about a week.  after that, everyone will forget and the donations will stop rolling in.  eventually the salvation army and fema leave and life supposedly goes on.  but if people in pensacola are still living in rvs and fema trailer parks and abandoned buildings almost a year after ivan, my heart hurts for everyone on the gulf coast hit by katrina.  on top of being poor, this area of the south, especially new orleans, is so heavily populated, i don't know how they'll ever recover.  

as for the people in the news and such talking trash on folks who are looting, shut the fuck up.  these businesses are insured, and will be getting back what they've lost, especially corporate businesses.  what the hell else has anyone got down there right now?  shit, i'd be lying if i told you my ass wouldn't be right there with the rest of them, getting my hands on whatever i could knowing that everything i once owned is gone.  one lady in some report actually said some shit about how ""i've wanted to come here for ten years.  i thought it was a sophisticated town.  i guess not.""  it's called survival of the fittest, bitch.  i mean, sure there are people stealing jewelry and clothes and shit, but for the most part the ""looting"" that is going on is in drugstores and grocery stores where people are coming out with food, water, and diapers and shit that they need, and on any given day would have prefered to drive to the store and buy rather than having to swim and break in somewhere for necessities.  and this shit is going on in front of police, they've been commandeering stores themselves and taking meds for people and whatnot.  what the fuck else can you do?  i mean seriously.  this is not the time to be judging.
i lit candles for anyone and everyone affected by this storm and will continue to do so.  and also, if my gulf coast people that i haven't talked to yet could give word as to your safety as soon as possible that would be so nice because i'm really worried about a couple folks i haven't heard from.  sending out as many good thoughts and positive vibes as possible.  please please let me know if there is anything i can do."

"event","Fetus's early ability to feel pain disputed.


A human fetus is unlikely to feel pain until the final months of pregnancy, according to a new medical report that is bound to stir up the public debate over abortion. 

""Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus,"" write the researchers at the University of California, San Francisco.

This consciousness is created by nerve connections between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex of the brain -- and these connections do not begin to develop before the 23rd week and possibly not until the 30th week after gestation, say the researchers. That means ""functional pain perception . . . does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks.""

The report, in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association, is being published just as anti-abortion groups are pushing for fetal pain laws. The U.S. Congress and several states are considering legislation that would require doctors to tell women seeking abortions 20 or more weeks after conception that a fetus feels pain and to offer anesthesia for the fetus.


 The researchers, led by Susan Lee, based their findings on a review of existing medical studies. They also warn that a woman's health could be jeopardized by trying to give an anesthetic directly to the fetus during an abortion. 

The proposed U.S. laws would affect a small fraction of abortions done in that country; only 1.4 per cent are performed after the 20th week. 

Even so, ""these laws have nothing to do with pain or pain reduction, but are clearly intended to stigmatize abortion, the women who have abortions and the doctors who provide them,"" Dr. Wendy Chavkin of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health told Reuters News Agency.

"event","okay, so here it is y'all...
the open call went beautifully and it was tons of fun.  

<b>I AM A FINALIST!!</b> or whatever they're calling it,
and may or may not hear something from them anytime 
between the 26th of june and when they start filming on july 7.
i am beyond ecstatic about being one of maybe 35? 40? women chosen out of the 1000+ that had shown up by the time they started having to send people away.

list style, so i don't forget anything:

1)  remember when like everything that could have gone wrong before i left town went wrong?  we finally got money situated because my boss was so effing nice, wrote me a paper check for the next pay period as an advance so i would have some money and let me off thirty minutes early so i could make it to the bank.  mateo was on time and we were heading that way when all of the sudden a man with one crooked tooth left and sunburnt skin came running into the road yelling ""the car is on fiah! yr gawn blow e'rybody up!""  so of course, as most people who have been told their car is on fire would do, mateo and i pull over and hop out of the supposedly flaming vehicle.  we inspect the car as much as we can being that we know nothing of cars while snaggletoothed chicken little calls the fire department (which is not even a block away, so we could actually hear the sirens cut on as he was on the phone)  they look at it, can't see any place where the car could possibly have been in flames, advise us not to drive it in case something is actually wrong, etc.  so no bank or picking up one hour photos to take on the trip.

2)  donna takes me to one of those check cashing places and they can't cash my check because they don't have my boss on their payroll roster or something.  they can call him to verify funds and all, but that would entail me getting on the phone with him in said seedy check cashing place to be like ""uh yeah my boyfriend's car caught on fire bla bla bla long story.""  luckily, mateo had more than enough funds to cover the trip.

3)  the plan was for me to go to sleep for a few hours before we were due to pick up the rental car, but my downstairs neighbor was playing video games and music and singing so loudly that i didn't doze at all until about 9 and about 20 minutes later i got my wake up call.  no sleep for shannon.

4)  oh this one is my favorite...  cut <lj-cut text= ""because it's long.""/> i had already asked donna if she wouldn't mind taking mateo and i to the car rental place and she had said it was no problem.  then, right when we're about to leave, she tells me she's bringing josh along.  and he's bringing his huge pit bull.  so aside from the fact that mateo would be completely uncomfortable being in the car with josh (since we hate him and he is sketchy and creepers and everything else) it's wierd because josh insists on having the dog come along and sit on his lap in the front seat.  so anyway, i get really pissed at donna because she knows neither mateo nor myself have any desire whatsoever to be in the company of this guy and she's all ""well i want someone to ride back with me"" so i say i will drive the rental alone and mateo can ride with her, but that i need mateo there in case they don't take my card since there wasn't as much money on it as i thought i needed,and he won't be comfortable coming along if josh is there.  this does not suit her and she insists on brining josh even though she knows how uncomfortable mateo is around him due to her feeling the need to betray the both of us and out him as trans for no fucking reason at all.  it's a safety issue, therefore, mateo was my number one priority.  she was totally stubborn and i was crying and feeling pulled in two directions and by this time i was saying fuck it i don't want to go because seriously, why did she have to make it so difficult?  why couldn't she have informed me of insisting that josh go before putting me on the spot right when we're about to leave to pick up mateo so that i have to look like a total bitch about everything?  i hate when i'm a position where someone is doing me a favor and therefore has like an advantage over me and feeling like that means i can't enforce personal boundaries as far as what i am comfortable with.  i do not like being forced into situations with this guy who i have no desire to be friends with whatsoever.
finally mateo says just to come get him, that he will come regardless of his personal security and feeling uncomfortable, for my sake.  which was really wonderful, but at the same time pissed me off so bad because that shouldn't have been the way it was.  donna knew the situation was all her fault, that all of this could have been avoided had she not fucked up in a few ways already, and still refused to lean for me and support me where other people in my life might not have had the priviledge of being able to do.  this is a really big thing right now in my head with her, her lack of being a friend and how selfish she has been lately, and i will probably revisit this subject another time.</lj-cut>

5)  we get on the road around midnight and i drive the whole way singing at the top of my lungs trying to stay awake and watching mateo drift in and out of uncomfortable front seat sleep next to me.

6)  arrive in atlanta around 6:30 am, find the hotel, don't see massive sprawling lines around the building yet so decided to drive around in search of denny's and a place for me to roll a blunt and smoke it.  we are successful in finding neither, but get a good tour of industrial downtown atlanta without getting ourselves lost.

7)  decide to park the car in early discount parking and just eat at the mcdonald's right across from the hotel.  order egg and cheese biscuit.  pick at it, and stare at it, wishing i could stomach it since i'm so hungry at this point i have that concave stomach if i eat i might puke feeling.

8)  go inside and find where to go, realize that there are already almost 100 girls there already, get my number (367, think good thoughts for 367), and get dressed.  in the bathroom, it was great, big girls primping, changing, laughing, but there was no outlet for my curling iron and i thought i would die.  i asked around and one of the ladies who works in the hotel ran me around for about 10 minutes looking for a place for me and finally she found this empty dark room where they host events but it had a little table and chair right next to an outlet and she gave me permission to sit there and do my hair 5 floors down from the crowded hot bathroom all the other girls were literally cramped into.  she was soooo so nice and i was immensely appreciative to her for helping me find a place to plug in!

9)  when i got back upstairs there were tons and tons more girls than just minutes before.  it was so amazing, all these beautiful confident big girls dressed to the motherfuckin nines.  i could have gone for the fashion watching alone.

10)  i waited for about an hour and was taken in with about 9-14 other girls for our interview with don wiener (insert laughter and cracks about welcome to the dollhouse here) the producer of the show.  he called each one of us up individually in front of himself and two skinny white women i'm assuming work for oxygen and asked us the required ""so tell us about yourself"" question that for some reason i can never adequately answer, boo.  i always get distracted and lose my train of thought when it comes to that question, but i managed to get out the important stuff like i sing, sew, dance, etc and am very interested in performing, which seemed to be a main inquiry of his.  and of course threw in for good measure the tired ""i'm just so happy to be here and have this opportunity"" not so much for good measure as because it was actually true.  it was mindblowing to simply be there, with a room full of gorgeous fatties all with the confidence enough to even show up for something like this.  that in itself was a main topic of discussion, considering the truly history-in-the-making feeling of it all.  it gives me goosebumps just to talk about it again!

11)  at the end of everyone being interviewed, he dismissed all but three of us, the chosen finalists from our group.  some groups they picked one, some none, but three from our's.  i was sooooo fucking excited!

12)  one girl got chosen simply because of how completely and utterly ridiculous she looked.  think lil kim wannabe (not fat, to top it all off) in a huge striped beige men's button up shirt, beige stilletos, cowboy hat, sunglasses (through the entire interview).  i was privy to the producer's whispered comments being that i read lips and body language well and after her interview he put her application on top and told the other ladies (when they had major wtf question mark eyes about his decision) ""some fun for mo'nique.""  burn.  i felt bad for her then, being that she was so excited about being picked (even though she admittedly wasn't into winning the contest, just wanted the exposure of being on television)  then after we're picked she goes on to me about how she just wants to get her mama out of the ghetto and honestly all i could think was baby don't we all.  being someone who comes from dirt, i really really can't stand it when people talk about their class status in a situation where it could garner sympathy points to have been poor.  especially since i would never have gone in there parading the fact that i want to be famous so i can do my mama right.  that's why we all want to be famous sweetie, totally old meme.  it would have been different if she'd gone about it in a way that was like ""let's relate to one another on this"" but it was definately more of a ""i deserve this more than you because..."" sort of way that put a few of the other girls off too (because she just kept ooooon and seriously what do you say to that after 20 minutes?  especially when you/your family is low class too?  that doesn't end up sounding like a i'm poorer than you contest?)

13)  after being picked, we were herded into this special room where we had to wait with no end in sight.  no one knew anything, no one could tell us how long we'd be there or anything so that was sort of nerve wracking, especially since mateo was being so patient waiting by himself the whole time with nothing to do and no way to know what was up with me.

14)  in the finalist room my sleep deprivity and lack of food were causing me to be super extra nervous and emotional feeling.  i am always thinking that i'm very highly over-rated and this really comes to the surface when i'm in large numbers of people i think are prettier/cooler/more worthy than i.  i just kept thinking that i am a big fish in a little pond here at home and that's why i get attention, and felt lost like a little fish in a big sea amongst all the other women.  mostly everyone was really nice and outgoing, but i still felt like, i don't know, out of place.  i think that being the racial minority sort of made me feel like that, i guess my white guilt got the best of me and i was feeling very much like maybe just my being there was going to make the other ladies uncomfortable or unhappy (but i looked several times on the website before even thinking about going for any sort of rules or ideas for the show that would have made it inappropriate for me to attend the open call and there were none).  the bond between those ladies seemed so much stronger and amazing to watch, but it also made me feel a little sad and left out.  i feel wierd talking about it because i'm sure there are fucked up elements to why i felt that way or why it's not valid but i don't mean to offend, simply saying the way i felt for a little while. 

15)  eventually, a woman from oxygen interviewed each of us randomly (i'm not sure if it ended being everyone or just a few of us because there seemed to be no method to the order in which she chose us and i stopped paying attention to how many people she was picking to see if it was indeed all of the finalists she ended up talking to.)  anyway, by this time i was like, a nervous wreck and i'm supposed to be answering these questions ""candidly"" but in full statement form like ""i would like to be on mo'nique's show because..."" and shit like that.  i totally kept losing my train of thought and looked at the camera once (which we weren't supposed to do) said the same thing over again a million times worded differently (i'm just so happy to be here with all these gorgeous ladies and have such an amazing opportunity to represent the big girls!) and then i was so nervous that the corner of my right lip started to twitch and pull downward so chances are they'll air that shit on the show whether i get on or not and i'll look like a stroke patient.  

16)  then we wait some more.  and more.

17)  seriously, was it like, a test to have a room full of big girls (who had been too nervous to eat breakfast to begin with) in a room with no substance for nearly 6 hours?  bitched kept talking about cheeseburgers and fried chicken and being typical hilarious fat girls needing to eat. 

18)  THEN at about 1:00 they start picking us off and having us go individually to another secret location, and then we realized that this was it, that soon each of us would have our turn to interview with mo'nique.  i was in the third group of five to line up and wait our turns.  while we were standing around i got to talk to mo'nique's personal bodygaurd of a few years and he was so funny and awesome.  he says he's trying to convince her to do a contest for big guys, haha.

19)  THEN IT WAS MY TURN TO MEET MO'NIQUE.  and with the combination of no sleep, no food, and excitement i was feeling like a little fucking chihauhau and less articulate than ever.  i came in and the first thing i said was ""i think i'm going to wet myself!""  which is soooo not me.  i'm smooth and funny!  again, i choked on the ""tell us about yourself"" question and spent the entire ride home thinking of the millions of brilliant things i could have said other than what i choked out.  anyway, i got smoother and hopefully they thought i was actually as funny and lovely as they let on.  i made mo'nique laugh a lot about funny big girl stuff and honestly that was the best part of my day, making mo'nique, a queen of comedy, laugh.  and her little gay man too.

20)  speaking of gay men, everyone assumed mateo was one of the many fags there to support their respective fag hags, instead of someone's boyfriend.  

21)  we jetted out of there pretty quickly once i was ""released"" and got on the highway immediately to get out of atlanta before eating or relaxing.  we stopped at a ruby tuesday (""because at least we know what we're gettin at ruby tuesday and it's generally good"") that tasted like absolute shit and smelled bad.  

22)  i rolled a blunt in the car before getting back on the highway with skittles, an ice cold diet coke, and 6 hours of driving ahead of me.  mateo's neck was in pain and he was totally tired (even though he had gotten sleep in the car when i hadn't!) so again i kept myself awake with loud singing to all my favorite cds and obsessing about all the things i couldawouldashoulda at the open call."

"event","so my favorite contemporary ""country"" song (and by favorite, i mean the song that comes on that is so horribly ridiculous i actually like when it comes on) is by jeff bates and it's called long slow kisses.  and to give you an idea of how ridiculous it is, the first verse goes a little like this:

(talking in his deep burly country man voice) 
hey baby.
i bet you're wondering 
(singing) what i'm doing home sooooo soon
naw, i ain't siiiiiick
(talking) it's just this morning when you told me you didn't feel special anymore,
(singing) well that broke my heart
so i had to turn around and come back
and tell you what i'm going to do about it

(chorus) i'm gonna light the bedroom candles
take the phone out of the wall
we can lay around and talk for hours
or maybe we won't talk at all
i'm gonna resurrect the love
that slipped away from us
and the man you've been missin'
startin' with some long, slow kisses.

i especially like the alternating between talking and singing.  the rest of the verses follow suit.
and now, on the radio, is a young lady hootin and hollerin because she just won free tickets to see master bates at the long branch this weekend.  woooooo hoooo."

"event","i'm absolutely outraged at this point.  the hypocracy of the republican administration is absurd.

did anyone know that in the midst of all this terri schiavo stuff, another case, involving an african american 5 month old boy with a lung deformity born to a poor single mother, was going on?  the law in texas, which bush passed when he was governor, says that if you're too poor to pay for the care and they determine it's not worth it to run up an unpaid bill, regardless of any disputes made from the patient or their gaurdian, the hospital has the ultimate say over whether or not treatment is continued.  they are given ten days to bring the matter to court or to find another facility willing to take the patient.  but if these attempts are failed, the hospital has the right to pull the plug.  no matter what.  guess what, without any media coverage, and not so much as a public bat of the eye from president bush, sun hudson was taken off of life support and died in his mama's arms.

a big thank you to k. for finding all these links.  she had put them in a comment and i wanted them to be up front page so y'all can read about all this shit.

"event","r.i.p. terri schiavo.

this is the letter i've been meaning to write to the editorials of our paper forever, and finally sent today.



First, I'd like to take this opportunity to wish Terri Schiavo peace as she passed, and peace to her family and loved ones in their time of grief.
Second, I can't help the urge to express the anger I feel with the way politics overtook this case.  The Christian right-wing stopped at nothing to use this event as some sort of party platform to further their agenda to create a monopoly on ""Morals.""  Nearly every statement made by President Bush through all of this has been an utter contradiction of what his administration is implementing.
Bush is quoted in an article on CNN.com on Terri Schiavo's death, ""I urge all those who honor Terri Schiavo to continue to work to build a culture of life where all Americans are welcomed and valued and protected.  Especially those who live at the mercy of others. The essence of civilization is that the strong have a duty to protect the weak...""
This tends not to be his sentiment when it comes to our responsibility as a nation to worldwide poverty and hunger, to poverty and hunger in the U.S., to those depending on social security due to physical disability, mental illness, or old age; to those depending on welfare, food stamps, medicaid and medicare to obtain the bare necessities for living; to those who are discriminated against, maimed and/or killed because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender; to those not lucky enough to be born rich, straight, white, and male.  This tends not to be his sentiment  when it comes to those who have been falsely accused and wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, or to those with mental illness or mental disability who have been wrongly sentenced to death for their crimes.  This tends not to be his sentiment as he sends more troops overseas, as more and more U.S. soldier and Iraqi deaths are reported, or as children starve to death every minute of every day he spends urging others to help those who live at the mercy of others.  
ALL of these people and many, many more are the weak, and I DO believe that it is the duty of the strong to protect their right to live.  Unfortunately, it is also my opinion that had Terri Schiavo's family not had the financial means to continue their daughter's medical treatment to begin with, her situation could not have gained the national attention it did.  And perhaps she would have passed quietly years ago, with dignity and without media fanfare, much like the hundreds of weak who passed just in the time it took for me to write this letter."

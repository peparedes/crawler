"event","<P>I've just burnt the strongest and best and most good looking bridge I know of... </P>
<P>I feel empty.</P>
<P>I told the wrong person about the wrong thing and then when it came back to bite my arse I got angry.&nbsp; I took some petrol to a bridge, lit a match and fell asleep in a drunken stupor.</P>
<P>I hate myself.</P>
<P>The consequences of my actions will probably only affect me.&nbsp; And Got DAMN does it hurt like a motherfucker.</P>
<P>I've said shit that may or may not be true to my friend Anneka.&nbsp; She then told my sister because they're closer friends than Anneka and myself are now.&nbsp; My sister hurt me so much I cried.&nbsp; I mean, I was bawling!&nbsp; My housemate, Danielle (who, it turns out, knew Anneka in primary school.&nbsp; Small world, huh!) was there to comfort me, but I was still so hurt by everything I said things I probably shouldn't of said to Anneka.&nbsp; Through sms no less.&nbsp; That's right, I'm chicken shit!</P>
<P>I feel like crap.</P>
<P>I was on close today, 3:30 to 12 am, and every time I got a break, and even before and after work when I was driving all I wanted to do was call her and just talk.&nbsp; Talk about random shit.&nbsp; That's what I love.&nbsp; Talking to Anneka about the most random things because she's there...</P>
<P>But now I've ruined it coz of one bad day following a few rocky months.&nbsp; </P>
<P>She told my sister things she knew I didn't want her to know, but I'M the one who sent the chicken shit message!&nbsp; I'M the one who's supposed to be responsible and who usually puts the worst kind of person before herself...</P>
<P>Now I'm lost. </P>
<P>My housemate and I, we're also on rocky grounds.&nbsp; To cut a long story short... I'm good friends with someone she thinks I shouldn't be.</P>
<P>My friend Lauren and I...&nbsp; Big Day Out (which ROCKED!!!) wasn't the best time for us.&nbsp; She was rude and I was cranky... Not. Cool.</P>
<P>The common denominator?&nbsp; Me!&nbsp; That's why my sis thinks I'm a drug fucked junkie!&nbsp; Coz I'm burning all the bridges I see and I can't stand her superiority.&nbsp; ""It's all the drugs.""&nbsp; I'm the loser and she's fucking perfect!&nbsp; I've just discovered 'fun' and she's responsible and thinks I'm a piece of shit.&nbsp; No, I don't have to pinging to have fun.&nbsp; Infact, ""drugs are bad, mmmkay?""&nbsp; I'm over them.&nbsp; But she thinks they're my entire life.&nbsp; What Anneka said didn't help.&nbsp; She made everything worse times a thousand!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'll be 21 in May.&nbsp; ... It's so depressing I could cry even harder.&nbsp; Everytime someone brings it up I get teary and walk away.&nbsp; 21 is my scary age.&nbsp; I haven't done anything with my life (like go overseas or sky dive) and it makes me upset.&nbsp; I'm going to get so FUCKED UP&nbsp;I can't remember my problems and don't remember I'm OLD for a week!!!&nbsp; I've told all my workmates.&nbsp; ""You can't let me remember I'm old, ok?&nbsp; You have to make sure I'm comatose before I go home!&nbsp; DON'T LET ME REMEMBER!""</P>
<P>I freaked most of them out.</P>
<P>.........&nbsp; I'm pretty worn out.&nbsp; Work was nothing, but&nbsp;being pretty damn sure&nbsp;that the best Best Friend you ever had probably hates and/or never wants to see you again is crushing.&nbsp; I have some alcohol here so I'm going to have it and hopefully pass out before 6 a.m.</P>
<P>Goodnight people.&nbsp; Learn from the mistakes of others and treasure good friendships.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Enjoy Forever!</P>"

"event","<P>Ok, so I'm not loving being sun burnt...&nbsp; Or the fact one of my good mates is being mean to me infront of her highschool friends (childish, I know) and calls me wude names...</P>
<P>But I <STRONG><EM>LUUUURVED</EM></STRONG> the Big Day Out!!!&nbsp; It made feel all tingly-wingley...&nbsp; Mainly in my feet coz they got trampled in moshes.&nbsp; But it was cool. LUUURRRV Faker!&nbsp; RADNESS!&nbsp; And enjoyed most of the day....</P>
<P>Then afore mentioned friend left me and our friend Emily and went off to get trashed with her other mates and didn't keep her phone on her.&nbsp; And nobody else was answering their phones!!!&nbsp; I had 4 out of 6 numbers, NOBODY ANSWERED!&nbsp; 80 thousand people or whatever, you'd think to keep your phone on you!!</P>
<P>*inhales*</P>
<P>Then Emily and myself bought contacts.&nbsp; SO cool.&nbsp; First time I've even worn them (tough cookies, those one) and now I have a red eye from scratching my eye socket...&nbsp; Yummeh.</P>
<P>I've been in Sydney for *counts* 3 days now.&nbsp; Staying in a hostel with backpackers and stuff, they're funny.&nbsp; We'll be chatting to them while out having a smoke or getting air coz we're trashed, and just start talking to people.&nbsp; I've met Engligh, Irish, Scottish, Swedish, French... and Dickhead.&nbsp; The Dickheads have a language of their own...&nbsp; Anyhow, I'm leaving the hostel early coz of this 'friend' giving me the constant shits, but my housemate Danielle, said she'd come pick me up after work, or we could stay at her friends house and chill out.&nbsp; She said to 'give me time to chill out.'&nbsp; She's such a sweetie sometimes!&nbsp; BTW, she finished work at 2:30 am.&nbsp; So she'll be here at 6-ish... and we're going to blow this popsickle stand and have a damn&nbsp;good time!&nbsp; She's actually an awsome housemate.&nbsp; She even taught me how to wake her properly...&nbsp; Very gently...&nbsp; She can get very crunky.&nbsp; VERY Crunky.</P>
<P>That's one of the reasons I came to Sydney, to get away from al the dramas everywhere, but now she's saving me.&nbsp; I have a lot of time for that girl.&nbsp; She's been brilliant... most of the time...</P>
<P>In other news:<BR>*Moved house.<BR>*Workmate is pregnant<BR>*I'm quitting smoking with her...<BR>*I'll be requiring 2 tolerant housemates in the next few months<BR>*I'm SO enjoying this trashbag week.&nbsp; <BR>*I'm now able to ignore mild hangovers from practice<BR>*I'm still learning to be a Duty Manager, but I'm coming along quite nicely... so they say.</P>

<P>But, there is no possible way I could do anything about it because... Uh... because I've been warned indirectly.</P>
<P>Other news, Work is going well.&nbsp; We had our Christmas party last week and it resulted in many fights, one member of McKellar Soccer Club losing a tooth, one getting fired and much more friction than before.&nbsp; Of course, the member of staff that got fired shouldn't have said what they said without knowing it'd get back to the boss and expect to get off scott free.&nbsp; But I was on almost best behavior!&nbsp; *puffs out chest*&nbsp; I was peace maker coz I've worked at the Hawker club and they all know me.&nbsp; At one point I was grabbing my friends in a vice grip and dragging her off....</P>

Wanted to tell someone: 
Everyone puts so much stock in you, you can do this....
I'm not the only one who knows that you can do so much better...
Why can't you see that you're a wonderful person who's knowledge and skill is wasted on this...
I don't do want to sniff meth with you, and I don't want to fuck you, so please leave me alone!!!!
I don't want to 'get to know you better'!  I know it's just code for sex!

My life is so fucked up.  I'm up for D.M. soon.  This is all speculation, but Naiz is prolly gonna be D.M. soon, so I'm gonna be stand in D.M.  She deserves it, but I fucking don't!!!! Any Tom, Dick and 'I just want to get to know you better' can tell you that!  I'm to immature!  Duty Manager!  Of a club!!!  In my current condition...  How about we ressurect Jesus!



I'm sorry.  I apologise to all Jesus lovers, but I have to say... even if it's just to state the obvious: he's dead.


""OMG!  I can't beleive she just said that.""

Well, I said it.

I'm sick of all the bullshit I have to deal with every day.  Even if I sleep all day, there's always bullshit.  I can't get through one Fucking DAY without something being fucked up!

Cryptic make the mind work harder...


*inhales*

So, Peter (my old D.M.) is moving away, Renae will more than likely take his place.  She can handle it better than anyone!  She has the talk, the knowledge...  She can make it.  But!  Does she think she can???  Nope.

Chatting with Matty tonight, he says they're gonna train me up as sub D.M. right?  WRONG!!!  I have the sensibility of a siberian ant.  THAT'S RIGHT! NO ONE KNOW'S WHAT THE FUCK THAT IS!!!!!!  

I just want....  to stop talking about me...?

No, I just want someone to go through the paces, and to say, 'calm down.  You're going to be alright.  You can handle this.  You'll do fine, but just take it one step at a time...'

I want... NO PRESSURE!!!!!!

I WANT TO KNOW WHY I FEEL LIKE SHIT!

I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I'M DOIND WRONG!

I WOULD LIKE.... time...  A friend...  To see what I'm doing...  And to walk me through it...

<P>Miss Mandy (now known as Top Gun) cut off 4 people last night.&nbsp; 4!!!!!&nbsp; That's more than people than I've cut off in my whole career.&nbsp; Only one more, but she's a little person, so her taking charge and being all assertive and stuff was wonderful.&nbsp; I was so proud I started calling her Top Gun, thus the new nickname.</P>
<P>And Renae...&nbsp; Well, I've always had alot of time for that woman, but now I have even more respect for her.&nbsp; She's tops.&nbsp; And that's big coming from me.</P>
<P>Danni Girl...&nbsp; We talked and she amazes me.&nbsp; She's got some stories that leave me slack-jawed, but she's still who she is now and I have massive respect for her, too.</P>

<P>I went to sleep at 3 am last night 'cause I was cleaning my house for the stupid bank appraiser, house&nbsp;maker-look-at-for-leasing-make-the-house-clean, guy...&nbsp; (Don't.&nbsp; Ask.)&nbsp; Then I was woken up by my alarm at 8:20 am so I could vacuum the house... but I decided to fuck it off, and rolled over and was then woken up by Morag AND the guy doing the appraisal on the house wanting to look at the master bedroom... and the ensuite...&nbsp; AND I was in... something resembling summertime jammies....</P>
<P>Then I had work.&nbsp; At 10:30.</P>
<P>With Peter.</P>
<P>Who's a bunghole.</P>
<P>Then Theresa came on.</P>
<P>Who's a crazy-head.</P>
<P>...and sometimes talks too much.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I almost cried twice today.&nbsp; I was so worn out and flustered and I couldn't handle everyone talking at me and I just wanted to have a cigarette!</P>
<P>Piper is looking at me.&nbsp; Fucken' bitch.&nbsp; She ate my chips.&nbsp; Her little cat head was in the bag of MY chips crunching away on MY chips and eating my CHIPS!</P>
<P>So!&nbsp; After I finished shovelling shit (working in reception) I had to go and pick up Annie and her friends and drop them all home.&nbsp; I was in a LOVELY mood!!!&nbsp; *coughs*</P>
<P>Then I changed, went back to work and had a few drinks (after my free beer it was all non-alcoholic) to de-stress with the gang and smoke my little lungs out.&nbsp; That, THAT, my friends, was the best bit of my frikken day!&nbsp; </P>
<P>I then left, got petrol, went home, and went back to work again to help Naiz with the stackers.&nbsp; She's helped me so much it seemed fair.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So... I met a guy the other week and we're meeting up tomorrow for a coffee/drink.&nbsp; He seems nice but I don't think I have too much in common with him...&nbsp; except we both don't like serving old people.&nbsp; I'm just...&nbsp; Blah... about the whole thing, really.&nbsp; I'm like, 'right, just another thing to do tomorrow, better shedule it in.'&nbsp; I'll worry when I'm not surviving on caffine alone...</P>

<P><STRONG>FREEEEEEEEEEEEE</STRONG> AGENT!&nbsp; Work is crap and I am happy!&nbsp; All right, check it, yo!&nbsp; I talked to Carol (a Duty Manager who'd been off for 3 weeks, but is now back) and said 'I like working here... BUT!&nbsp; I can't handle working here full time anymore.'&nbsp; I explained everything and we had a really good chat and she said I should talk to Jimmy (the operations manager).&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; My little heart was pounding so hard I almost fainted!!!</P>
<P>So??&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; So here's the thing, in two weeks time I'm back as a casual!!!&nbsp; I said they could teach me to do reception to fill&nbsp;in on short notice, I told them I didn't mind being trained as a DM to cover shifts, I even said I could work upstairs in the bistro.&nbsp; It's a go.&nbsp; Woo Hoo!</P>
<P>Why are they being so obliging???&nbsp; WELL!!!&nbsp; SO MANY casual are leaving, Adele, the lovely full-time receptionist, is leaving, too, as well as Michelle, a part time receptionist/new bar worker.&nbsp; They need the people, and I'm willing to stick around, but I just don't want to be full-time anymore.&nbsp; I am SO happy I can't stop grinning.&nbsp; I even wrote down my casual shifts today and I just couldn't beleive it happened so fast.&nbsp; I thought they'd keep me on full-time for another month to 6 weeks, but NOOOOOO!</P>

"event","<P>So, hey, I didn't get fired!&nbsp; I got a talk from Carol (one of the Duty Managers) and stuff, and finally some new shirts.&nbsp; I don't have my own system for setting up and closing, and I'm really slow.&nbsp; I get confused about what's higher priority and I get side-tracked and I end up taking forever, and people have noticed and conversed and basically said if I don't get into gear I'll get a formal warning.&nbsp; So Carol and I discussed things to help, and then decided I could ask Renae to show me her system for things and CRIKEY RENAE did it help!!!&nbsp; It's just little tid-bits that shave off a few minutes and and what should be done in what order and things, but it's SO helpful.&nbsp; I was so grateful to Renae that yesterday (when she came in on her day off to help me) I shouted her a couple of beers.&nbsp; I shouted Corey a drink too, but it was only a soft-drink because he was being responsible.&nbsp; Then I think they went to search for the fm 104.7 fugitive.&nbsp; They even called today while I was putting up the races to ask if I heard the clues on the radio and to ask my opinion.&nbsp; I was no help, but it was still cool.</P>
<P>I'm on stupid opens all this week, and after my 4 day break I get to do all the shit things I did this week, like washing hundered of glasses, cleaning everything in sight, lifting heavy-ass hoppers full of dollar coins and serving stupid people.&nbsp; I'm not supposed to be on opens this week, I'm supposed to be closing.&nbsp; The Closer.&nbsp; The person who gets to sleep in late and work nights, but NooooOOOOOoooooo!&nbsp; They had to change it around and fuck ME around and give ME the shit jobs for 2 weeks and give ME responsibility of being to only full-timer on to make sure things go smoothly.</P>
<P>Today I was supposed to finish at 5, right?&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Spot on.&nbsp; Gold star.&nbsp; But then it finally sinks in that Mick isn't rostered on until 5.&nbsp; So there'd be a 10 to 15 minute time period where there's no till in the bar OR bar staff.&nbsp; Pete said he and Theresa could manag, but with no till, HOW?&nbsp; So they call in Mick a little earlier, like 10 minutes!&nbsp;&nbsp;So once he arrives I ignore all the customers at the bar, do a quick TAB changeover and then (while there's maybe 7 people waiting to be served) I grab my till and leave to go and count it.&nbsp; I left at 5:15, which isn't bad, but instead of paying overtime, Pete says I'll just get an extra 15 minute break tomorrow.&nbsp; <BR>While signing out I was talking with Adele (the lovely receptionist who is SO nice to me) who said, 'why don't you just leave earlier tomorrow?'&nbsp; I said, 'hey, yeah!&nbsp; That's a great idea.&nbsp; Thank you soooo much!' and went to grab my staff drink.</P>
<P>My birthday is on Saturday.&nbsp; Morag and I are thinking of having a small dinner out in Civic.&nbsp; She said she'll drive so I can drink sangria or something.&nbsp; And fishbowls of alcoholic beverages.&nbsp; I said I didn't plan on getting smashed as I have work the next day, but that it still sounds like a nice idea.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I haven't been counting down, really.&nbsp; Just dreading being the age where people think you have to be responsible and grown up and shit.&nbsp; 20.&nbsp; TWENty.&nbsp; TwenTY.&nbsp; Twonteh!&nbsp; Toowantiyuh.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Woooo!&nbsp; I had a shit day at work.&nbsp; I wanted to eat a cigar (or 20) and drink every beer I served (except VB).&nbsp; I worked a half hour overtime because Justin didn't know he was rostered on in the bistro, so Mick had to go up and take over and Renae went on her break early.&nbsp; Carol (the darling!) asked me to stay an extra half hour and said she'd sign the overtime slip and I said it was fine, because I understood they were understaffed and it was an unexpectedly busy night.&nbsp; I was busy from 2 (when&nbsp;I finished my break) until 7:30.&nbsp; For all y'all math drop-outs, that's 5 and a half hours of non-stop running around.</P>
<P>... But it's ok.&nbsp; I have been ""required at the changebar"" several times now to do payouts (YES!!!&nbsp; I'm important!).&nbsp; They even call my name out over the P.A.!!!&nbsp; I rock!&nbsp; I also found out (at the end of my shift) that I now FINALLY have my own frikken till number!&nbsp; It's like they want me to stay!&nbsp;<BR> I had this theory, you see, that they didn't give me a till number because they were going to fire me.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; They haven't yet, but they did give out a memo stapled to all the payslips about all the new rules (most of which I think are ALL my fault).&nbsp; But I'm not overly worried, because I can do payouts AND have my own till number!</P>
<P>Now I'm drinking wine, about to see what my sis brought me home for dinner and will go to the loo soon, so life is good.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>.... Rebecca and Anneka (and I totaly agree) think my next tattoo should be the words ""float on"".&nbsp; And I'm thinking a little feather underneath.&nbsp; If you listen to the song by modest mouse, they're like, 'sometimes shit happens, but's ok, just float on!'&nbsp; And that's pretty much how I take life.&nbsp; I bitch and moan, I get knocked down...&nbsp; But I get up again, I float on, I get over the shit and I'm happy.&nbsp; Ieither deal with it, or not, but either way I don't let things take control of my life.&nbsp; I try to see the good things.&nbsp; Like my VERY&nbsp;OWN till number.&nbsp; That's some shit to be happy about!</P>

(note: stock rec. is a form where the closer writes down all the stock that will be needed for the next day, and the opener puts it away after Brian, the handy and very nice beer god, gets all the stock and puts it on the bar bench, unless it's a weekend, where the opener has to do it all.)

I actually just shrugged it off, but after I thought about it, he yelled at me!  Fuck Saturdays are hard!  Justin (a casual with less knowledge of the T.A.B. than me) was supposed to be on T.A.B. duty, but her didn't know the ins and outs, so I suggested we switch, which was fine.  The T.A.B. itself was fine, but the punters are all rude assholes who bets more than they earn and loose more than they gain!

Goddamn I hate rude customers!!!  The ones that treat me like a machine that's only there to serve them, and don't care about the other customers.  I hate their rudeness, I hate the way they talk, I hate the drinks I serve them!

... *inhales*  ... They just suck!

I saw this, and I felt like posting it...

<P>I bought 2 bottles of wine from the club today.&nbsp; Both red.&nbsp; The Cab. merlot is very nice.&nbsp; The other I will sample later in time.&nbsp; I don't want to get smashed.</P>
<P>Last Saturday I got smashed and went out to Civic with Morag and Louise and Mary and some others....&nbsp; I was off my face and ran into some guys from work.&nbsp; How fun!&nbsp; They're chef's, and I'm off my face!&nbsp; Big Tom, Little Tom and Denis.&nbsp; Damn they're fun to hang around.&nbsp; They had asked me to go out with them a few weeks ago, but I was working, and how funny, I run into them while smashed!!!!&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It made me think, y'know.&nbsp; I was a little sad that Matt hates me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a little sad that I've been upset lately, not because of Matt, but because of other things.&nbsp; I was chuffed I hung out with 'the guys'.&nbsp; I was feelin' ill.&nbsp; I was vomiting.&nbsp; I was cheered at in the taxi line for vomiting...&nbsp; I'm missing something....</P>

<P>Yesterday was actually alright.&nbsp; Although I <EM>did</EM> come back from Wagga Wagga a day early.&nbsp; Morag decided she wanted to head home, so I decided I'd come, so then Lachlan decided he'd come back, too.&nbsp; Mum &amp; Jimmy stayed in Wagga like proper polite people.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I miss Sonny.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I left her at Anneka's so she could look after her while I was gone and I miss her.&nbsp; Especially last night when I <EM>wasn't</EM> too tired to notice her absence from my bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Other than that, everything is wonderful.&nbsp; New t.v.'s.&nbsp; New dvd's.&nbsp; Awesome&nbsp;CD to listen to.&nbsp; No work until tomorrow.&nbsp; The Killers CD.&nbsp; Lachalan's totally just letting me listen to his iPod.&nbsp; Infact, he's just like, 'you want to listen to it?&nbsp; I can put the Killers on it now,'&nbsp;and such.&nbsp; He's so cool sometimes.&nbsp; He bought me Kill Bill 1 and 2 for Christmas,&nbsp; How RAD!</P>

<P>It's now a fact.&nbsp; I hate it because it always makes me unhappy.</P>
<P>I think next year I might just go away and ignore it all!&nbsp; I'll be in my own little shell on my own, sipping on something I can't pronounce that's the equivalent to a brain hemorrhage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I just came back from the motel.&nbsp; Our Christmas party was this evening.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Besides choking it was ok.&nbsp; ...I wish I didn't go.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In other news, I was wearing my Fuck-me boots (I did NOT name them!!!) today and before I put them on I was picking glass out of the bottom of them.&nbsp; I had NO idea where it came from!!!&nbsp; Then I was like, 'w<EM>here did all this glass come from from?&nbsp; When did I last wear these boots???</EM>' and it turns out that the last time I wore them I was out clubbing and met Zane.&nbsp; Fucking clubs!!!&nbsp; Getting glass in my SHOES!!!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I want to *mumbles*.&nbsp; Im sorry, what I said was:&nbsp; I WANT TO EAT NOW!!!</P>

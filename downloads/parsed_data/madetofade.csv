This is how I feel today, you guys! Last night was rough. For probably the first time ever, not only was Rachel NOT an hour late, but she was actually on time! We think that's why the whole night was so bizarre - I'm finding it difficult to articulate just why it felt so ""down the rabbit hole"", but the night started with us getting lost on the way to a place we go on a regular basis - I guess we never navigate that area of Echo Park during the day (or sober). I think, somehow, her showing up early created a shift in what was supposed to happen last night. Everything was so confusing. Two 40s and a six pack of Sparks Black, and innumerable drinks at Good Luck Bar (I think) later*, I wake up and I'm already at work! How did I get here, you guys? This Sparks stuff is amazing!



*I should mention that all this was between us, not me alone. I might have a problem, but it's not that bad, guys."

"event","I should also take this time to talk about the surreal feeling today has brought:

* One single bird wing on the sidewalk today, the cleanest cut. I took pictures and people gave me weird looks, but COME ON, how often do you see an entire bird wing on the ground, sliced right off? How did that happen?*

* An elderly woman was lost on Wilshire. I met her at Fairfax and she was trying to find the bus towards Curson. She didn't really understand my directions, and as I had nothing better to do but mope and listen to the day sleepers, I walked her back to the bus stop she needed to go to. You know what her name was? Else Hajek. 

* Not so much surreal, but as I was cleaning today, I bumped my bookshelf really hard and knocked a row of books off. My instincts told me to save them, and I tried, but when they all landed on the ground (Sorry William who lives below me!!) I had to laugh, because for some reason I thought I could hold all of that information, all of that knowledge in one hand...

Now I'm getting drunk off my Laphroig while I wait for Rachel to fetch me, because someone blocked me in to my parking spot. 

Gurgle gurgle.

"event","Hey! So the thing I think is the most important thing in life is inspiration. You guys already know this about me. How do you get inspiration? You have experiences! New ones! Today I had a new experience. Do you want to hear about it? <br /><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""follow meeee...."">I spent my first night in my new totally fucking awesome apartment last night. I also met a few of Celina's friends who are very attractive and cool and have amazing names, but that's beside the point. When we got home, I (as someone of vastly superior intellect) decided that it would behoove me to leave my car parked on the street, because it would afford me a few extra minutes in the morning that would normally be spent trying to negotiate the ridiculously tight off street parking situation we have. <br /><br />This morning I skip out to the front of our totally fucking awesome four-plex. WOW, I have never seen an entire street empty by nine am! How funny! (My skipping slows down a little here as I am tapped by an incipient realization...) Huh. My car is gone too. That's weirrrr-- wait! <em>My car is gone!</em> Eek! All my stuff! ALL MY STUFF! Eek again! Eek squared!<br /><br />Then I, as someone if marginally superior intellect, realized that it's much more probable that my car hasn't been stolen, that it's surely in the loving and gentle hands of a towing company. I was right. I had neglected to read the sign <em>(the one I parked right in front of, you guys)</em> &nbsp;the night before, because I (thought I) knew that there was no parking on Fridays. I mean, I was right, there IS no parking from 6 am - 6 pm on Fridays but also days like today, which happen to be Wednesdays and are also the days that the street gets re-tarred.&nbsp;<br /><br />The police towing station was a little fun. I was in a good mood because I really thought I would walk out of there with a funny story, but I didn't. I mean, I made a few jokes with the clerk, but nothing <em>really </em>funny happened, and oddly enough, <em>that's</em> what put me in a grumpy mood.<br /><br />And now I have absolutely no money at all. Like, not even for food! This should warrant a funny story, I (as someone with only a modicum of intellect) think....Dumpster Diving 2: <em>This time it's not for my glasses!</em></div>"

(It's quite long, but so, so worth it). May I present&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""the crazy to end all crazies!"">From our MySpace:<br /><br />Dear *******, <br /><br />I have a twisted story to tell. You've probably seen many of the horrors in the world. I am facing horrors right now I you've never imagined. I can't seem to discard a couple demons that weighing me down. I fear a stalker going to bury me alive. You might find this story amusing in a twisted way. It's based on real life. My life. I question if I should go to the media with this story? I am seriously trying to avoid the spotlight. I'm only seeking to expose this someone and get some form of protection for me and my family. <br />My life became the perfect nightmare after I went to a writers conference in hopes of getting a book deal. There I met a bestselling author named, John Saul. He and his lover, Michael Sack expressed an interest in my work. They were my teachers and spoke with me regularly on the computer. I noticed my material appearing in their books after the conference. Throughout my mothers cancer illness my computers were hacked into and destroyed. Some crazy person kept telling me Im I was imagining things. I did a script for UCLA on the computer that was stolen and turned into the movie 'The Godsend'. I used final draft. I've received numerous death threats since. He uses my familys real name and my parents street address in his books. He's put me in his books. Someone toys with me online and says they're my killer and even claims to be cannibal. He says he'll destroy me in the end for exposing him. He also says he's going to abduct me and shoot me with heroine and make me a street whore. He said this before his book came out where he did exactly that to the characters. He was stalking them in the book. He prides himself on creating mental terror. He steals my ideas. Yesterday someone he hacked into my Dell computer and stole valuable files. He turned off my nortons protection and avg. He went through zone alarm like butter. He has a video game out through mindscape. I am still being stalking after all of these years and threatened for no reason. All because I had a dream. I have been to the police and the FBI. I have even been to psychic, Noreen Renier. I""m seriously considering going to the media now. Do you know how I might protect myself? I just want people to know this monster exists before he destroys me. I really don't know how to protect myself anymore. He knows I""m afraid of the spotlight. I don't want attention. I want someone to do an investigation into his past. I want to expose him and show the cimes he has committed. I want him to suffer some for what he's done so he leaves me alone. <br />Here is another holiday trashed by him. <br />I was followed me to a message board yesterday. <br />I told them I never understood pollock jokes. Especially the one where it takes two pollocks to screw in a light bulb. I don't know why people make fun of the polish. <br />--- <br />I asked why it takes two gay writers and one editor to write a bestseller? <br />The writer who does his plots is kept hidden from the world like the hunchback of Notredam.(Michael Sack) He's the twisted writer who supposidly enjoys watching teenagers slit their wrist on the mental ward where he used to be a work. He bragged about it exciting him. John Saul says Michael has the dark mind. Michael says John is the dark man. The handsome writer receives all the praise and glory. The media calls him a supernatural talent and gifted psychological suspense writer. All of his books pertain to children suffering mercilessly and losing their lives at the hands of monsters like these. After they are physicially and psychologically tortured they are disposed of. They are hunted and stalked and bullied like me. The person online says extracting the life force in people feeds him. The real kicker: The famous writer gets most of his ideas from a no name female writer whom he claims to despise.(Me) He's gotten three books off of me now and a movie deal. He enjoys putting the victims in his book for some thrill? I can't understand what feeds these two? What made people this twisted? I can't understand why he won't leave me alone? Where is the happy ending in this fairytale Joe? Who is the good guy here? He will probably base his next book on my work. I have a feeling my exorcist/psychiatrist story will be used by him. He grows more more wealthy and strong. He has no remoarse. He's older than me and more experienced. He brags about being smart and powerful. He's had years of practice at stealing and discarding his victims. <br />--- <br />Meanwhile the starving writer stays in the dungeon spinning shit into gold trying to create stories of substance from her miseries as they feed off her essence. Every time she attempts to discard the old story and create a new one, they more throw more stones at her. <br />--- <br />They pounded her tonight. Perhaps they hate Easter. I kept quite at first. I just wanted to know I had talent. I feared being sued for slander. He said he and his attorney would sue me if I mentioned this. Some devilish person said instant message they would kill me if I mentioned this and I would have no future. I have spent close to a fortune trying to protect myself $10,000 on a high tech security service, computer forensics investigation and legal advice. My back is up against the wall. I am out numbered. He has an army he says. He claims they belong to some cult like in the movies 'The Believers'. He says they watch me and know what I'm always doing. He also says they abduct children and feed on them. He says he's athiest and hates Jesus Christ. He wants to corrupt everything. I worked with a forensics investigator for the FBI for a long time. I have done everything humanely possible to ward off this guy. I don't know what else to do? <br />--- <br />Can you advise based on your expertise? I know this is just cyberworld but still it's affecting my real life. This is a strange case I realize. I am reaching out to people who have contact with the media and understand the twisted mind. Even the fbi and police said this was too twisted for them. That must be why his books are so popular. I seriously think his publishing company keeps him on top. It isn't because he's that talented. <br />I know you're very busy. I just wanted to share my story. It feels good to let others know because it's what he hates most. He deeply fears exposure. He and his gay lover have managed to keep it hidden for all of these years. Would I risk getting sued if I wasn't telling the truth. I'd like to put the videotapes from the conferences and my hard drives in the hand of the media. Could you advise. <br />Thanks,(No I'm not crazy I swear.) <br />Sincerely <br />Sherry&nbsp;*** <br /></div>"

One thing that I actually appreciate about LA is that living here I automatically gain access to certain memorials and monuments that I find pretty exciting. Yesterday was the anniversary of Notorious BIG's murder. The hip hop station I have programmed into my car played nothing but Biggie as I drove out to the valley and back before work. During lunch, I took my Theraflu in a thermos and walked a few blocks down to the Peterson Auto Museum where he was shot, and listened to some select tracks off of ""Ready to Die"" and ""Life After Death"" (released just weeks after his murder.) Ughhhh, I know this sounds lame as shit, but it was really cool.

It's not that it was abysmal, it's just that I cannot fathom how a studio is going to market a film about a modern story about the myth of vagina dentata. By the plot line, one would expect that this was made by a woman, or as those who aren't familiar with feminism put it, ""a man hating dyke"", but it's not. The director is Mitchel Lichtenstein (son of the artist we are all familiar with). It's campy and bizarre and occassionally laugh out loud funny, but in the end, not all that good. It's actually kind of poorly made, but Jess Weixler is fantastic as Dawn. So there you have it. The only person I could ever recommend this to is Becky D. because she likes bizarre stuff and I think we could have a great conversation about it afterwards.<br /><br /><a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0810988/"">The Nines</a>&nbsp;This film is told through three interwoven stories, all starring a suprisingly talented Ryan Reynolds, the immaculate Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy, who is phenominal. The first story is one of the best 25 minutes I had last week. It was incredible. The second story faltered just a tiny bit and the the thrid story, with the big reveal, was embarrassing. Awful, awful, awful. You should see it anyway. <br /><br /><a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0811106/"">The 10</a>&nbsp;The worst film I saw at Sundance. 10 vignettes telling each of the 10 Commandments. Aimless, with jokes that weren't funny the first three times around. I was sorely disappointed because I was 100% sure I was going to love it. How could David Wain go from Wet Hot American Summer to this? The cast is incredible! Too bad it was painful.<br /><br /><a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0756729/"">Year of the Dog</a>&nbsp;What happened, Mike White? This was forgettable.

"event","<p>I discovered a new hobby this weekend!&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Dumpster diving!"">It started when Devin and Brittany were about to leave to pick up some In-N-Out and meet me at our old apartment to finish packing and I realized I couldn't find my glasses. Now, I will wander off sans eyewear (in fact I'm not even wearing them right now because my face is so close to the screen) but if there is one thing I absolutely cannot do without my glasses, it is driving. We tore the new apartment apart searching for my glasses. I <em>knew</em>&nbsp;they had been on the table the night previous, when I was laying down and watching Walk the Line. Since Devin had to meet a guy at the Argyle Ave apt to sell his old TV, he had to leave right away. I told them to go ahead and I would meet them there once I figured out where my damn glasses had gone.<br /><br />I was cursing myself for treating my eyewear so poorly and always losing them and than not being able to find them because I need them to find things (they've been misplaced in an underpants drawer, in pillowcases and, once, in the freezer). I looked at out living room table and suddenly realized it was missing half the crap that had been on it the night before. I texted Devin:<br /><br />""What did you throw away this morning?""<br />""Clear plastic bags.""<br />""Where they on or around the table?""<br />""yes..""<br /><br />Here I am feeling sick. I look at the trash can, which has recently been emptied.<br /><br />""...Where does the trash chute lead?""<br />""Garage, black bag.""<br /><br />I ran downstairs and (after five minutes of loitering while I waited for people to leave the garage,&nbsp;jumping and hoisting) found myself in the dumpster tearing open garbage bags, praying that my glasses weren't beyond repair. As I am filtering through refuse, someone approached the dumpster, throws a trash bag on my head and closes the doors, locking me in the bin in total black. Totally humiliated, I made a feeble attempt at knocking on the door, trying to let someone know I had been locked in, but they were already gone. I stood there for a minute and then I heard a grinding noise above me. Like an idiot, I look up (still pitch black in here, eliza) only to realize that I am standing directly below the trash chute itself and someone was too fucking lazy to bag their garbage. Dirty diapers, banana peels, ect. I started to laugh pretty hard then, and cry <em>just a tiny bit</em>. I squatted down, because there was nothing I could do at this point besides wait for some unsuspecting soul&nbsp;to open the doors again and throw more fucking trash on me. (Which they did a few minutes later and -<em>thank god</em>- left the doors open this time.)<br /><br />Devin showed up not long after that, to discover his guttersnipe girlfriend still feverishly picking through his neighbors' trash. It was at this time that I realized that my glasses were gone. There was just too much trash in there to pick through any more, making any step more likely that I was going to step on the glasses that I was sure I'd never see again.&nbsp;<br /><br />Defeated, I climbed out of the dumpster and we went back up to the apartment. I scrubbed my hands like I was going in to surgery and sat down on the couch, when Brittany leaned down and discovered my glasses, pristine and unharmed, just under the glass top of the coffee table.</div>"

"event","I don't even know where to start. As Becky and Annick can attest, such a huge thing is difficult to just start talking about, when there is so much that has happened. I will write all about the films I saw tomorrow, but today is for trying to regain feeling in my extremities after the stress (and the cold, most likely) rendered me numb. <br /><br />As I was driving out of the parking lot towards my new home yesterday afternoon, I felt suspiciously calm in my car, so I turned up the music and revelled in this newfound freedom (if we are to say that fear of driving is a prison, which it totally, <em>totally</em> is) and sang along to Cold War Kids. I felt strangely optimistic and almost like a new person, which seems to happen&nbsp;as one is&nbsp;coming home after a festival. Then I realized I was on 12 hours of sleep in a week and probably still a little drunk... I thought a lot of about what I would talk about today, and I had some very eloquent thoughts and realizations and now I'm pretty sure they leaked out of my ears with the rest of my brain last night.<br /><br />Usually it's very hard to pick a favorite moment out of an entire experience, but this time there's no question. I had just finished a film called <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0479289/"">The Go Getter</a>, which was my favorite one of the fest. It left me in such an incredible mood and I felt like I was ending one of the best days of my life. I kept thinking about how someday I would be able to make someone feel the way I did at that moment just by showing them my film. The shuttle driver played that Mellow Yellow song by Donovan over and over and over as he escorted us back to HQ. I don't know why this is standing out, but it is and I will not argue it.&nbsp;<br /><br />the end<br /><br /><br />PS: To be honest, your postcards have been written and stamped, but not sent. One bit of information you may enjoy: I had a little help picking out the postcards from <a href=""http://imdb.com/name/nm0000164/"">this dude</a>. I think he might be an actor or something...."

Second of all, we decided to choose the Detroit St. apartment. There's a lot of stuff to walk or take a 2 minute drive to...Farmer's Market, a fantastic venue called the El Rey (I have seen !!!, Ladytron and in a month M. Ward here), an expensive, lame and touristy outdoor mall called the Grove, which I'm sure we'll go to a lot despite it's faults, the Beverly Center and LACMA (a great museum I am a member of), plus I can now choose to take a long walk to work on nice days. The apartment is nicer than we remember, and will be better once the carpet is replaced. It's still small and very white and dull, but it just turned out to be the best choice for us. I'm sort of bummed we had to decide against an incredible and beautiful apartment - but it was just too far away from anything but houses and carpet stores and centers for hassidic jews to warrant moving there.

Funny side story, though. As we were leaving, the manager mentioned our next door neighbor, a stand up comedian. For any of you that saw Jerry Seinfeld's documentary Comedian will know who Orny Adams is, and why this is not exciting at all. I feel a little bad judging him from a documentary he was featured in, but...wow. The dude is an ass."

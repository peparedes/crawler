"event","Contiuing with my reading of ""Think Out of the Box"" I found another gem that makes a lot of sense to me as related to writing, especially during the process of critique and revision. The authors suggest that whenever we evaluate anything, we should focus on the positives, listing only the strengths and what IS working. Their premise is that by doing this, the missing pieces or ""weaknesses"" will be clear. But because they are not stated or written down, our mind does not get caught up in the critic mode or the negative thinking that often prevents people from moving to out-of-the-box brain activity. When we list the negatives or weaknesses, our brain focuses on them and has trouble moving past them. The negative self-talk becomes overwhelming chatter, difficult to block out- very counterproductive. By only stating the positives, you then ""know"" what pieces need to be strengthened to measure up to the positives, and you can work on those elements without tearing up your confidence and self-image. 

The next chapter talks about the nine elements that make up their concept of thinking out of the box, but a lot of it seems to relate more directly to corporate groups. I'll have to read a bit more to relate it to my writing and my small single-person business ventures. All the same, I am learning a lot and have ordered the next book that I will be reading to help me in my ventures, ""Sleep Thinking"" by Eric Maisel. It's supposed to give you a system whereby you can train your brain to work on solving problems while you are sleeping. At this point, I need all the time I can get on problem-solving. Working on them while I sleep will buy me 6 more hours. Woohoo! I've ordered the book and it will be here in a week and a half; plenty of time to finish the current book. 

It occurs to me that an article applying some of these concepts to artistic pursuits of all kinds, including writing, might fulfill the blog-turned-salable assignment?

"event","Though I have not been faithful in my entries here, I am trying desperately to get back on track with the rest of my BC goals. As I mentioned in an earlier post, I began reading ""Think Out of the Box."" I've only read a few chapters, but already I have found some ideas to consider in my writing endeavor, as well as my other two businesses. 

The first point that Vance and Deacon make in their book concerns the way that people in American society, and probably many others as well, view stress, excess, and change as things to be avoided or, at the least, minimized. They suggest that people who are truly creative in mind and spirit, those who think out of the box, welcome these things instead of avoiding them in their lives. They recognize stress as a symptom of growth and change, a challenge instead of an obstacle. They are not suggesting that we should not take care of ourselves and minimize unnecessary stress; but instead learn to recognize stress that encourages change and growth. According to Vance and Deacon many societies, Americans in particular, fall into one of two categories regarding the concept of excess. The first group indulges in ""things"" to excess- wine, food, exercise, sex, etc... unhealthy things when taken to excess. The second group has a strong puritan-influenced work ethic in which any excess is seen as a bad thing. Vance and Deacon suggest that excess energy, influences, experiences, resources, and even ""things"" can be used to increase creative energy. They say that stress, excess, and change should be embraced and welcomed in our lives as the energizing forces that they are instead of watered down and minimized. 

In terms of my writing, I am guilty of the typical American attitude towards stress, excess, and change, though I'm not sure when I started buying into the system. I go to bed at a ""reasonable"" time so I won't be tired and stressed the next morning, even if my character is still talking to me. Often I'm stressed and tired anyway, because the character continued chattering as I struggled to fall asleep on them. I don't want to change my habits because it will throw my daughter's routine off and confuse her. But I should be able to change my habits independently of her routine if I'm creative in thinking outside the box and not getting stuck in a rutted routine myself. I tend to bury myself in an excess of food often in an effort to bury an excess of feelings. The excessive feelings could be expressed through dynamic writing instead, breaking through the conventional norms and instead creating something new and expressive. 

I want to work on embracing stress, excess, and change in my writing for the next few weeks and see what kinds of shifts I experience in my writing, in my businesses, and in my life. I hope the rest of the book will give me more ideas on HOW to do that."

"event","Just about the time I think I know where I'm going, how I'm going to get there, and why I chose that direction... I change my mind. True to form, I have changed my mind about the genre and form of ""The March"" assignment we have been given. I'm switching to fiction, a short story to enter in a contest. And her's the trippy part. I changed my mind after nothing more than reading a 2-page article about winning contests in the Writer's Digest magazine that arrived today. It reminded me how much I used to really enjoy entering my short stories in contests (even though I never won a single contest) and how much I learned about writing and my strengths and weaknesses as a writer from the process.

I have a few stories that I entered in the past that I NOW understand why they never won thanks to this article. And a few others that might still be salvageable. But I'm actually looking forward to writing some new ones that incorporate what I have learned in the past 3 years since entering contests regularly. I've entered a few here and there during that time, but not many. I began feeling like I was spinning my wheels and getting nowhere, and spending money to do it! Maybe I've learned enough now to actually have a shot at it. If nothing else, it's one more writing challenge to meet and overcome in my career path. Short stories... what delicious fun! I haven't written one in forever. Starting with the list of words should make for an interesting beginning...

Well, my time is up and I've got to get back to the paid assignment tonight and beat that incredibly tight deadline that I let sneak up on me!"

"event","What happened to my week last week?! I didn't accomplish a SINGLE goal for the week. Not one. That's not to say that I didn't make progress, but that isn't good enough. I don't know what else to say, except this week HAS to be better... So exactly the same goals for the 2nd week in a row:
GOALS FOR WEEK 3:
1. Draft 800 new words of my novel each day.
2. Lessons 3-6, home inspection
3. Follow up on RCC online teaching opportunity.
4. Finish and submit self-motivation curriculum.
5. Create Guru marketing package and update portfolio.
6. Submit Guru bids through June 15th.

On a more positive note, I did get some work done on a web content assignment that is under a tight deadline, with hopes of finishing the initial draft tonight. Also, last Friday I sent out 3 queries that were NOT on my list of goals, but I got them out anyway. And I did create a business plan for the next 3 months that integrates all 3 business ventures, including writing. So, I guess that's where my week went. More focus will be necessary to complete my goals AND the extras!"

"event","Okay, not really a ""writing day"" at all, as it's 9 pm, and this is the first writing I've done today. My husband let me sleep in this morning as his final gift before leaving to attend school for 2 weeks. This is the longest we have been separated since we met 5 years ago, and I couldn't admit to him how truly excited I am for the time apart. I love my husband with all my heart and I can't imagine my life without him in it. And, of course, my daughter needs her daddy- she is a COMPLETE daddy's girl! But I KNOW, have known for a while now, that I need time away from him to figure out exactly how to balance writing with the rest of our lives. Writing as a career came to me after we had been together for three and a half years (married for 1 1/2 of them), so I've never had the chance to fully integrate it into our life together. I finished grad school right before we met and that was the last time I wrote full-time, with firm deadlines and anything riding on the quality of the writing. To my credit, I worked full-time, changed jobs twice, wrecked my truck twice, and moved once during the duration of grad school, and raised a 3-year-old alone during the final semester. So I KNOW I can integrate writing with life. But I don't know how to integrate it into life with another adult person. I'm hoping that if I experiment with my schedule and figure out what works, establish some routines and habits, then when he returns home I can keep them in place and tell him what works for me. He is supportive of my writing overall and wants to see me succeed, so I know he's open to a change in our routine, we just haven't had the time or opportunity to work on it. 
So, yeah, I'll miss him a lot. Especially during the second week. But I am SOO looking forward to finding out what works and getting way more done than I have so far.

"event","I have actually thought about the question of an ultimate dream a lot in the past two years. I feel like it has crystallized in my mind and that I have been taking, and continue to take, baby steps towards realizing the dream. 

My dream is to be to Redlands University what Joyce Carol Oates is to Princeton. The prolific writer who is on staff with full benefits, who teaches one or two seminars each semester, and writes in my private faculty office (one overlooking my favorite rose garden, please; or maybe an office in the Victorian-style Alumni House on campus...) the rest of the time.

The dream includes publication of one or two novels each year, for upper5- or 6-figure amounts. It includes several months' worth of travel each year to locations around the globe, but with frequent long stays in both Italy and Mexico, the homes of my heart.

That's really it. Of course, I wouldn't deny public acclaim and wealth, but it really isn't integral to the dream. The dream is more about freedom to write what I love (books, especially fiction) and to travel at will. And to be paid well enough to do both with minimum distraction."

"event","I missed yesterday here in my blog and on my fiction writing, but I got a lot of ""work"" done sitting at my office away from home for 3 hours last night. While I was eating dinner, I read an article by Susan J. Letham of www.Inspired2Write.com that stated the following: 

""The more you write, the more you'll be able to write. That's true of all creativity. The more you create, the more creative and imaginative you will become. The more diverse your modes of creativity, the more interlaced your creative abilities will become, and the easier it will be for you to mesh them and do what is often called ""thinking outside the box.""

I spent a fair amount of time mulling that over and came up with a number of observations, but also some questions, which I guess are the foundation of all learning. It seems true that the more I write, the more I am able to write. Just writing here every day has increased my total output, not even counting this writing as ""real"" writing, though it is. Something about the discipline of writing something about writing here every day has given me discipline in writing something else every day too, not just on the days when I ""have time"" or it's convenient. I find myself making time for it and taking it seriously. Of course, it then begs the question, am I writing more because I'm more disciplined and it's been there all along, or am I writing more because I am more creative and, therefore, have a stronger desire to make time for it? 

Then there's the issue of ""diverse modes of creativity."" From the content in the rest of the article, I believe Letham is referring to other creative forms such as music, painting, drawing, etc... I can't draw or paint to save my life, which is fine with me. I can play the piano, but don't very often. I'm wondering if it's enough to view beautiful paintings, drawings, and photographs, and listen to inspiring music as a way of integrating a variety of creative modes? I know many creativity coaches would say, yes, that counts. But I also wonder if I drew some basic sketches( no matter how badly) or played a few songs on the piano before I sat down to write (maybe instead of Free Cell? Nah... maybe not! :-) ) if the writing would come easier and more inspired? It's something to consider. I don't want to say, Yes, I'll do it! and then spend all of my writing time trying to develop ""new"" creative skills instead of writing. There's a fine balance there. And if I'm not blocked or experiencing difficulty writing, then why mess with a good thing? 

Of course, the answer to that lies in the final phrase of Letham's quote: ""thinking outside the box."" The first time I learned about that concept was at a seminar that I attended. The keynote speaker was Mike Vance, the former dean of Disney University. His talk was based on his book, ""Think Out of the Box,"" which he had written with his partner, Diance Deacon, the President of the Creative Thinking Association. The strange thing for me now is that I can't remember where or why I attended the conference. In my memory, the conference was part of my training to teach Gifted Education classes in the public school system. But following the conference, I was so impressed with Vance's presentation that I rushed right out and bought his book, which I now notice was published in 1997, 2 years after I left the classroom... hmm. Very strange.

Anyway, the relationship between creativity and boxed thinking... It makes sense that new approaches to and practices in writing would take the writing in different, new directions. DaVinci's notebooks are a great example of how that works in the human brain. My basic question would be: what can I do to increase my creativity and productivity without sacrificing my already limited writing time? For starters, I think I'm going to read the book (which I never got around to reading before... how sad is that?!), experiment with listening to a variety of music while I write, and include sketches and story maps more in my journals and research for my book projects.

I'll try to remember to return to this issue in a few weeks and let you all know how the experiment, and the book, turn out.

Oooohh... on another (related) note, a friend of mine recommended the book ""Sleep Thinking"" by Eric Maisel as a great reference for developing increased creativity while you sleep. She has been using it to work out plot and character issues in her novel-in-progress. I'm looking into that one too, just in case I don't have enough to do! Of course, my husband leaves tomorrow to attend school in Northern CA for 2 weeks, so I should have WAAAYY more time to work and write in the next 2 weeks. Don't get me wrong, I love him dearly and will miss him a lot, but   Woooohooooo! What I will get done with a LOT fewer distractions!"

"event","I had determined that I would do a weekly review and analysis of my boot camp goals each Monday. But Monday was a U.S. holiday which I included in my weekend off, and I forgot to to do the review yesterday. So here it is, Wednesday, and I'm doing it now. Next week I'll be back on track.

First for the goal review. My 1st big for week one were to write 800 new words on my work in progress each day. My average daily word count for the week was 530. Not bad, for returning to an old work and getting back into it. But I still want to push myself to get to a minimum of 800 words each day; and not an average, but a minimum. My 2nd big goal for the week was to finish 3 home inspection assignments. I almost finished one. I have the exam and the practice inspection left to finish. I'm feeling anxious about this one because I received my final paycheck this week and have no more major income source. Home inspection is supposed to fill that void, but it won't unless I finish the coursework soon. So, that goal needs to take higher precedence. In addition to the 2 big goals, I had 4 smaller goals of which I only completed one: Guru bids through June 1st. I actually completed bids on opportunities through June 5th. However, as I look ahead at week 2's goals, I find that I completed 2 of those this past week, ahead of schedule. I scheduled my BeautiControl training for August 29th in San Diego, and I finished reading the Consultant's Guide.

For BC points in the past week, I gave myself 38. I had 37 for writing, 16 for blogging, and -15 for procrastination in its various forms. Now, when I compare my task list, goal list, and points, I'm not completely satisfied with what I accomplished this week. Part of the problem is evident in not giving myself credit for everything I DID accomplish. For instance, I spent the better part of the weekend doing a major overhaul on our living room and that wasn't and still isn't on the list of accomplishments. So I need to do daily evaluations of where the time is going and make sure that any changes in the original plan are reflected on the schedule/task list. It's all about effective record-keeping and accountability. 

ON TO GOALS FOR WEEK 2:
1. Draft 800 new words of my novel each day.
2. Lessons 3-6, home inspection
3. Follow up on RCC online teaching opportunity.
4. Finish and submit self-motivation curriculum.
5. Create Guru marketing package and update portfolio.
6. Submit Guru bids through June 15th.

Whew! I'd better get to it!"

"event","My writing took a very strange place in my life and consciousness this weekend: the back seat. It was terribly uncomfortable and I missed it being in it's rightful place- riding shotgun. Usually, everything I do is colored by my writing goals, where they fit in, how I can turn it into a ""writing experience,"" wholly integrated into my life. This weekend, I only thought about writing a few times. Once when I worked on a deadline (that was research, really, instead of writing), and once when I wrote in my long-hand journal last night. 
I stayed very busy this weekend overall. My husband and I hung crown moulding in the living room and baseboards in the living room and hallway. I washed all of the curtains and windows and vacuumed the furniture. We purchased slipcovers for the couch and living room chairs and trim for my office which he painted with plans to hang it sometime this week. I will scrub the living room floor and refinish it tomorrow after I have caught up with my writing and recovered from the weekend. 
The reason for the big push to finish the living room is twofold. First, we've had it 1/2 finished for over a year now (retextured the ceiling and painted, new curtains), liveable, but not the way we wanted it. Secondly, I will be using the living room to hold weekly home spas as part of my new venture as a BeautiControl consultant. I wanted the room to have a comfortable, elegant, spa-like environment for my guests. Yes, it's prettier, but let's face it: it will improve sales! So my energy has been with the new business venture instead of with my writing. It has to be to get the other businesses off the ground and to get the 3 ventures smoothly integrated, but I REALLY missed the writing. 
Lesson learned from the weekend hiatus? My PRIMARY business is writing. The other 2 are supplementary to the writing, and ultimately must be treated as such."

"event","I was going to take the weekend away from this blog, but I can't do it. Yesterday I read an article on coming-of-age novels, their history, development, popularity, characteristics, etc. The article was pointing out that when the genre developed, women had relatively silent lives overall, relegated to the kitchen and the nursery. But in more recent decades, many women have become avid readers and writers, recording and sharing their life experiences. Many of the phases and events of a woman's life follow a story arc similar to the traditional coming-of-age story. The article also pointed out that many modern-day heroines (and heroes) are teens or 20-somethings, because modern societies try to maintain an illusion of eternal youth and beauty. 
Now, none of the ideas in the novel were entirely new to me, and those that were new weren't much of a surprise. But the application to my own writing! I realized as I was reading that my struggle to identify my novel as a coming-of-age story with a mid-late 30-something protagonist was exactly what the article was addressing. I kept trying to force Reno to be 20-something, even though it didn't feel entirely natural or right. And I kept feeling like I was writing a coming-of-age story with a really ""aged"" (experienced, warped, NOT naive) character which didn't fit with anything I ""knew"" about marketing and target audiences for the genre. 
Soo... I have come to terms with the fact that my intuition was completely right (as usual... when will I learn to trust it??). I AM writing in the coming-of-age genre, my protagonist IS 30-something, and my target audience is NOT 16-24. And it's perfectly okay, and probably exactly what the baby boomer and GenX audience will enjoy and relate to. I'm really not completely crazy (just marginally so...)!"

"event","... or ""never judge a book by its cover."" This entry is all Heather's fault. Her observations of people and eavesdropping on conversations reminded me of just how much I enjoy both of these activities! It reminded me of an entry I wrote in my journal when I was about 6 months pregnant. A woman came in with her beautiful son who appeared to be about 4 or 5 years old, and with her parents. The little boy was very busy, and very comfortable in the coffeehouse. He marched right in and chose the table that he wanted them to sit at, and moved enough chairs around the table for all of them, carefully counting to make sure he had enough. While he was doing this, the adults ordered their lunches. The grandfather acknowledged the little boy's selection of tables and moved to get some napkins for them. The grandmother, however, scolded the boy and selected a different table across the room and made him move to join her. He didn't complain or fuss, but his face was so crestfallen! My pregnant, hormonal self wanted to slap that woman hard! I don't think that the boy's mother noticed the exchange, or if she did, she was used to it- having been raised herself by the grandmother. Anyway, I continued to watch the family as they ate their lunch. The grandmother did not speak to the little boy except to correct or scold him. Not once! She conversed only with his mother. The grandfather talked to the boy and looked at the drawings he pulled from his backpack. Together, they got more napkins for the table. When the family left, I wrote in my journal, ""My baby is so blessed with my parents. My mother will NEVER treat my baby that way; it just isn't in her! If anything, she is so silly with her grandchildren that it becomes embarrassing... for me. The baby will adore it!""
I have to add at this point that I have seen that family many times since the incident, and generally the grandmother is much nicer to the little boy, who now has a baby sister just a few months old. She has even talked (very nicely!) with my baby daughter a few times since then. I guess she was having a crummy day or something. But, boy, talk about first impressions! I was really giving her dirty looks that first day!
Yes, I love eavesdropping and watching the parade of humanity! And most of my observations eventually become part of a story or an article idea. Heather, if you're reading this, you've got to write an article on how to wash a sewing machine... I can't even imagine how or why that might be done! And I'm certain an article has never been written on it. ;-)
Rats! It's only 8 am and my daughter is already awake. So much for getting my writing done while she sleeps. Her nap time can't come soon enough today!"

"event","Writers would be warm, loyal, and otherwise terrific people--if only they'd stop writing.
- Laura Miller from a salon.com review of the movie Finding Forrester 

Not exactly what I've been thinking about lately, but it's somewhere on the same spectrum. I don't have any casual friends since I started writing for money and working from home. It occurs to me that for a long time, even before writing became a priority, the only ""friends"" that I had were people that I worked with. When I changed jobs, we always said we'd stay in touch, but eventually we just didn't. 

I have writing friends online, and the friends that I made in grad school keep in touch regularly, by phone or online as well. I get to see them periodically when one or another of us is traveling. But I don't have day-to-day friends that I call just to talk, or go to coffee with just because, or trade kids with for some shopping time, or... well you get the picture. 

Most of the time, I don't care. Which makes me feel a twinge of guilt because I think maybe I should care. Once in a while I get lonely, but not often. When I do, I bury myself in a story and talk to my characters in my head and it goes away. Re-reading this makes me sound certifiable, even to myself. 

In terms of the quote, I don't think anyone has ever called me ""warm,"" though I'm loyal to a fault.

Oh hell, I'm done. This was a stupid idea. I have nothing to say about my writing today and am just going through the motions of finishing this blog so I can do something useful. There's still 3 minutes left... 
oh well. Today, I just don't care."

"event","I am returning to work on an old friend today: my ""original"" novel. Otherwise known as the ""real"" novel, my first novel (though it's actually my 2nd), and ""Reno."" There was a time when Reno, the main character, was an integrated part of my life. So much so that she became my alter ego for a time, enabling me to deal with some issues I wouldn't have known how to handle otherwise. She's a tough biker who enjoys working outdoors. She enjoys men, but she doesn't need them for anything. She thinks for herself and takes care of herself, knowing that no one will do it for her. 
When I was single and escaping from a painful, mentally abusive relationship, I had already begun to tell Reno's story. I would find myself, after a particularly productive writing session, asking myself, ""What would Reno do? How would she handle this?"" The answers often caused an enormous blowup in an already volatile situation, but ultimately the answers led the way out. They gave me strength that I was unaware of having, and smartass comments that made my points with some grace. When I went out dancing alone and a stranger asked me to dance and then the follow up question, ""So, what's your name?"" I always said, Reno. It was safer that way. My husband still has ""Reno"" in the phone list on his cellular speed dial to reach my cell phone.
When I graduated from grad school, I had a tattoo of a sunburst with a crescent moon and a Bethlehem star in the center of it tattooed on my lower back to celebrate my writing and my successful foray through the rigors of a graduate program. After my husband and I had been dating for a while and I knew I was safe and loved, I attributed the changes in my life to what I had learned from Reno. Her name was added above the sunburst on my back. 
So with our history, why did I abandon her? Her story began to feel too much like my own, the borders were blurring. I was afraid that I was blending her story, separate from me, with my cliche memoir of a broken relationship. It felt too real, and too close. But since I have stopped writing her story, she has still been whispering it to me in the dead of night and when I'm working on other projects (totally unrelated projects, mind you. Completely distracting me from my ""work!""). I have to finish it. She won't rest in peace until I take her there. As it stands now, I've left her pregnant, with 3 potential baby-fathers, with no job and the impetus to physically relocate. (I can't imagine why she won't leave me alone!) So back to Reno, again, for the final round of drafting."

"event","I'm running a little late with this assignment and, as a result, Kai has already posted the routine she would like us to adopt. The good news is that a lot of her routine mirrors my own, with a few minor changes. I get up before my daughter every morning to get some writing done before she wakes; anywhere from 1-4 hours, depending on how early I can convince myself to roll out of bed and how long she sleeps. She has begun sleeping until 9 am lately, so if I get up at my usual 5 am then I have 4 uninterrupted hours. Half of a U.S. workday! Of course, I rarely get up at 5 these days because I stay up too late in the evenings. Sooo... earlier to bed is a must. 
Anyway, I get up before K. and check/clear/answer/delete all email. I rarely put email into folders as then I have to go through those and clean them out periodically. I would rather deal with each message one time, read it/answer it/delete it and be done. Of course there are a few documents, membership material, files that I have to keep, but most can easily be dispatched with one reading. Then I play one game, either Spider Solitaire or Free Cell (what is it about starting with those games?). I write in my blog (after Boot Camp, it will be a blog AND/OR my longhand journal) next. Then, I write. If I have a tight deadline, that's what I work on; if not, I work on a novel. My morning writing time is almost exclusively novel-writing. After K. wakes up, we eat breakfast and play a bit, and then I can do the ""business"" of writing while she continues to play. I mail out brochures, return client calls, submit bids on new projects, write and send queries during this time because for me these chores don't require the same concentration and focus. I also answer/eliminate any email that has accumulated since early AM. The rest of my day is bouncing between the ""business"" and actual writing, depending on whether K. is awake or asleep. During her naps, I can draft articles, essays, reviews, analyses, whatever is on the agenda with approaching deadlines. While she is awake, I work on business, housework, errands, meal prep. etc. 
In all my actual writing time is typically 4 hours in the am, 3 hours of nap time, and 1-2 hours in the evening after K. is in bed. Wow! When I see that in writing, I have to ask myself, what the hell have I been doing?? Okay, lately, I've been spending part of that time in preparing/completing my coursework for the 2 other businesses I am starting. Still, more writing is possible. 
One other piece of my routine is a weekly ""meeting"" with myself at the local coffee house. It is my office away from home, and the employees there are very supportive of my writing (okay, I've done a feature on their manager's band, so that helps!) and keep the passionfruit iced tea flowing freely. When I'm very lucky and my husband has an easy week at work, I actually get extra sessions at the coffee house while he plays with K, so there are ""gifts"" of time that I can't plan for, but I use for writing or study.
I think that's everything. On paper, it looks like so much writing time, but in reality it feels fragmented and ineffective. I need to figure out how to reconcile those perceptions."

"event","I have returned from my brief vacation in Sonoma, CA. I know real boot camp doesn't grant leaves, but this was a trip planned many months ago so I feel no guilt. And to justify it further, it was only three days. I had big plans to keep up with my writing journaling/blogging during our trip, as we spent a lot of time in the car with my husband driving. But instead, I only did one assignment on our first day out and spent the rest of the time reading ""Ender's Game"" to my husband. He had never read the book and it's one of my favorites, so we enjoyed it immensely. By way of, again, justification, I do have a paid assignment to summarize and analyze the book chapter by chapter. So now I can finish that in the next few days and get paid to read one of my favorite books.
The assignment I completed on Saturday, was the one on goals for the next month. I will post that next, though since it took me so long to figure them out and post them, I am a week behind everyone else. I think I understand the point system better now too, so I will start tracking my points this week. I'm not sure what my exact points were last week, but in all I think it was a good week and would have ended in positive numbers because I pushed myself to get things done before leaving and I was playing catch-up after my week-long phone/internet troubles. I know I spent too long on my goal assignment, but I wanted to get it ""right."" I want them to mean something and be well-thought out so that I can achieve what really matters to me, not just something to keep up. Of course, that just goes to show me that I need to work more efficiently, to be accurate AND timely..."

"event","... but just for the weekend. This will be my last entry here until Tuesday. I will write about writing for 10 minutes each day in my longhand journal while I am on the road, mostly because I probably would have anyway and I enjoy it. But I'm not going to transfer those entries here, so I hope you'll take my word for it that I will get it done. 
My husband and I are heading north for this weekend's Nascar race as a belated birthday present for him. It's a present to me too, since we get to have dinner with one of my high school buddies tomorrow night on our way up there. It's hard to believe that we've been friends for OVER half of our lives. I'm looking forward to meeting his 7 month old daughter for the first time too! 
Today, I have already finished and submitted a feature article, entered a writing contest, and written a testimonial for a client's website. All that, and the day isn't over yet. I've still got a good 5 hours or so until bedtime (2.5 hours 'til daughter's bedtime!). Looking at what I've accomplished around/with her and other home responsibilities makes me realize that my entry here from last night is totally on track. It isn't that I don't have time to write, but that I'm not using my time as effectively or productively as I could. Because I don't ""have to.""
But I need to reprogram the tapes in my head. If I want to make writing a career, not just a hobby, I DO ""have to."" The assignments here, aside from developing good habits, are forcing me to truly become conscious of where my time goes and why.
On a slightly different note, since I still have 3 minutes...  I wrote an article in the last 24 hours. That's it. 24 hours. Granted, it was on a topic that I know fairly well and required a minimum of research. But that still seems too short and easy. Did I do something wrong? Or have I just bought into the mumbo-jumbo that writing is such ""hard work"" that you can't possibly write a feature article and do it justice in anything less than a few days? It feels like a solid article. I'm sure the editor will tell me if it's not what he had in mind. And I don't generally question the quality of my work, but this forum is changing all of my ""generally""s upside-down (in a good way!). What would happen if every time I was assigned an article, I wrote it right away? 1-20 days, whatever it takes, and got it out of the way; clearing my plate for more of my novel/creative writing? I think I'd better find out what would happen if I'm going to achieve my goal of a full novel draft by the end of boot camp!!

Woohoo! I just noticed that I have an entry for EVERY day for the past week! Yeah!"

"event","I've been carefully planning my daily goals/projects/deadlines in Office Outlook for the past month or so and tracking time spent on writing projects/deadlines in my EasyNoter file for the past week. I'm noticing that in spite of, or maybe because of, my self-assigned deadlines I'm falling behind on a daily basis. Am I really overfilling my days by that much or am I underproducing by that much? I think it's a combination of both. I find myself NOT meeting the deadlines I impose because other projects, chores, situations, meetings come up unexpectedly which I have no way to plan for, but also because I choose to do things other than the items that are on my list for the day. Useful things like working out, baking treats for my daughter, cleaning the hall closet, but not the things on my list. Since I make a practice of setting a personal deadline several days before the actual deadline, I think that I'll be ahead of the game, not finishing projects at the last minute like I have for the better part of my life. But when I miss the personal deadline, I rationalize with ""it's not really due for 3 more days anyway. I still have time..."" 
So, here I sit 30 hours away from leaving for a long weekend to indulge in a Nascar race in wine country and dinner with a high school buddy, with a deadline pending. Yes, the project is 3/4 done, but it's late and I can't focus now, so I'll have to finish it in the morning. But that's only one project. What about the other 7 projects I had hoped to finish before I leave? Two of them, I know I will finish tomorrow before we leave because they are simple, and one is ""officially"" due Saturday. Two of them, I can do while we travel, and they involve planning for my businesses, so I'm excited about doing them and don't mind working on them while I'm on vacation. But that's not the point really.
The point is that I'm not very effective at planning right now. I have a warped sense of time, either expecting too much or doing too little, again probably both. I need to work on fixing that..."

"event","I just found this interesting quote and didn't even stop on it long enough to note who said it (so my apologies to whoever said it if they are still among the living). It instantly reminded me of a short story I began writing in grad school but never finished (story of my life thus far...) The story was based on a boy I knew in high school, Scott Tuttle. He was my guardian angel. Whenever I got in trouble- not smarting off in class trouble, but the REAL kind- he just appeared, silently, out of nowhere. He was a big kid, a man, really. Tall, broad, and silent; painfully shy. Even after he must have graduated, he still kept appearing whenever I needed him. 

Looking back now, I have a horrible sinking feeling. Was he a stalker? How did he always know when I was in trouble? Did he manipulate the events to give himself the opportunity to ""save"" me? But no, I know that is just my suspicious, distrustful mind messing with me again. He was the good guy. He had no way to manipulate the situations I got myself into for his own benefit. Sometimes I have to just trust that, yes, there are guardian angels in our world and I had one. A very real, very sweet one, for a short time when I needed him most. 

Anyway, in the short story which I began many years ago, I let my magical-realism filled imagination run free and create the most incredible guardian angel I could imagine while still embodying Scott's qualities. Somewhere between the semester deadlines and the graduate seminar readings, I never finished the story. I think I'll drag it out this afternoon and look at it again. Maybe I can finish it, market it or enter it in some contests and get a little recognition for the man who I lost touch with many years ago, the man who saved my life, literally, several times.

Scott, ""he has the gift of quiet.""

Reading back over this entry, I am interested by the writing invoked by a random quote. I don't often use writing prompts, but generally sit down with a story or project in mind to write about and work on and an outline/plan already in place. But with the quote, I was reminded of a story-start which I hadn't thought about in years, yet still love. I am compelled to dig it out and work on it again. Maybe I should incorporate the use of random quotes and writing prompts once or twice a week, just to see where my mind takes me? The mind is such a strange landscape to wander about in..."

"event","""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."" - Aristotle

Kind of a dud quote. Actually a fine quote, it just doesn't kick my muse into gear as I had hoped a quote would. I'm frustrated by not being able to access the internet and email, and so afraid that I'm missing important correspondence that's going to impact my business success. It's a complete distraction from doing the work that I can do without research and email access. 
Anyway, the quote...
I guess my education is showing. I often entertain new and different thoughts without immediately or completely accepting them as Truth. I question and argue most things before making decisions about them. I think I learned this trait from my dad, who has very limited formal education and yet is one of the wisest people I know. He examines and questions things; he's curious about everything. Of course, when I consider that, I have to also question what real education is. I didn't learn these things from school and neither did my dad. I learned from him and he learned from... I don't know. My grandfather, maybe. Another man with a limited formal education. Hmmm. 
Well, my time is up on this one, thankfully. I didn't enjoy this entry as much as some of the others. Maybe next time I should use one of my writer's quotes from the Writer's Book of Quotes that Mom gave me for Christmas a few years ago."

"event","Fact: within me is the power to succeed at anything I put my mind to. 
Fact: If I believe that, everything else will fall into place.

My (hypothetical)ideal:
- $3,500. combined income each month from home inspections, online teaching, and writing assignments/projects.
- 2 novels written, edited, and sold annually.
- Clean, comfortable home with all desired improvements completed or scheduled.
- I want to be 60 pounds lighter than I am now.

By boot camp's end, I could (hypothetically):
- Draft one complete (50,000 word) novel.
- Complete all of my home inspection coursework and perform my first paid inspection.
- Apply to teach online courses at a minimum of 10 institutions/sources.
- develop curriculum for 4 classes at UniversalClass.com . 
- finish improvements in my living room, paint the doors in my office, paint the game room and the back patio.
- Safely, sanely lose 20 pounds, minimum.

Obstacles to my hypothetical ideal:
- Heat/smog could prevent or inhibit regular exercise.
- Low energy level.
- Outside demands on my time (especially those of my small child) limit productivity.
- Limited finances."

"event","As promised in yesterday's entry, I checked out Flylady again, refreshed my memory about morning/evening routines, emergency housecleaning 101, cleaning zones, and the 1 hour weekly house blessing. I'm feeling like I'm gettting back on track and back OFF the merry-go-round. It will probably take a good 4 months to completely de-clutter my house and get it into the shape that I want it to be in for the long-term, but that's okay. Already, there's a lot less dust and general clutter. I spent 2 hours doing the 1 hour blessing. Of course, I had my 16 month old daughter's ""help"" with most of it and not my husband's. I think if I plan future blessings more effectively, I can reverse that and actually cut some time off instead of adding to it. Whatever, it works and I'm feeling better about the ""house stuff"" already. AND... here I am getting my five minute plus blog in early today too! See me go! 
Now that Kimberly is napping, and the house blessing is done, I think I will start on my writing projects and ""real work"" while the floor finishes drying."

"event","I'm setting this journal up as a tool to be used for the duration of Writer's Boot Camp. I suspect, however, that even after I graduate from Boot Camp I will still use this journal to track progress on various writing projects. My writing life has felt so scattered and unorganized for the past six months or so and I don't know how to get a handle on it by myself. Boot Camp seems like a good answer. I have so many goals including increasing my writing income to the point that I don't have to work for someone else just to pay the bills and support my family. I would also like to finally finish and publish the two novels and one nonfiction book that I have started. I know for that to happen, I have to make working on these projects priority, or at least ensure that they are on the radar screen! 
Anyway, I'm beginning again, full of hope, full of fury (the good, productive kind...) riding on pure adrenaline."

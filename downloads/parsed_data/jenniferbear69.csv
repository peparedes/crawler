"event","And each one makes me feel so good and so baffled. gwennie's is so childlike and sweet, and missing of me.  Jain's is so intense and deep and resonate.  They both move and baffle me.  I am loved.  What a wacky feeling.  Trying hard to wrap my brain around that one sometimes.  After 2 years of mourning Theresa's death, I came out of my dark lonely woods and joined the living.  I join a group of people, and I'm charming and funny and kind.  And then I need to run back in my woods again.  But not for as long this time.  Because I know that they want to see me again and laugh again, and know my heart again, and my kindness and my love.  Such an odd thing being an introvert.  How we rely on the safety, the security of our solidarity. Hurt so many times, that we know in our loneliness, there is safety, quietness, and only the pain that we emotionally inflict upon ourselves, in our guilt or self loathing.  I've stopped the last two a long, long time ago, but now and then they resurface.  Now to me, it's the time with people, socializing, the laughing, the performing, and then I run to my den.  The precious quiet, not having to come up with words, explainations, alone and peaceful and healing.  I need that recharging.  Maybe that's such the incredible appeal writing had to me, since back in 6th grade. Ms. Speigel's free writing time.  Wow she was beautiful.  One of major crushes in jr high.  Writing, saying whatever we wanted, and not having to get up in front of the class, and be sweating, and embarrassing, and fat, and in not cool enough clothing, and stumble over our words.  The freedom I had in writing was life changing.  Diana, wherever you are, I thank you eternally for the gifts you awoken in me.  But such is the life of the introvert.  Quiet, hiding, writing, meditating, and then coming out of our den, scratching our furry heads and smiling but still baffled at why they say they love me.

"event","Wanna be drunk with love like Puff my cat just a few minutes ago in my lap.  Funny thing is I have the potential for it, I have it right in front of me sometimes, but the perfectionist is always at work.  It's never quite like what you've planned, it doesn't fill the perimeters.  Am I stupid to wait for the mouse, who may never want me the same way i want her?  I loved Theresa with all my soul and as much as she nevered loved me back the way loved her, I was greatful for what we had.  The bond stronger then friendship or this lifetime's worth of knowledge or love.  It scanned over lifetimes.  But like it seemed in past lives, one was always meant to be taken.  As I was taken from her in battle, she was now taken from me in this lifetime.  I look forward to meeting her in the next life.  BUT back to the mouse.  Is it better to love and spend time with someone who may never love you back then to just give up on the hope and pull yourself away in search of other love?  I think it's worth it.  Although the agony of not getting that persons love, the richness of your life with that person at least in it, makes it worth it.  Perplexing.  Cats are whores.  LOL.  Get some loving in my lap and then hop down and go eat, or lick themselves.  Get loving from someone else 10 mins later.  LOL.   I'd like to be a cat, but I think I moved on from cat a long time ago.  With Shamanism, different animals are in your life, for reasons.  Bear I don't think will leave me.  Solitary.  Woods.  It's my wiccan nature, and my introvert.  I recharge on my own, in the woods, fishing.  Just don't want to be alone forever.  Think I gave too much of my heart away to trust it in large quantities to anyone.  So everyone gets nothing more then bite-sized love now a days.  Reminds me of this song by YIKES, dolly parten.  ""Take for instance this old broken heart, if you will just replace the missing parts, you will come to see just how good it really is, take it and you never will be sorry that you did.""  Makes me wonder about that reclaiming business.  or shamanic soul retrieval.  How much of that really works.  I think I will get a charge up with my sister coming here next weekend.  Power of three will set us free.  LOL.  3 Grune women.  Perhaps we can have a backyard rit.  I think that would be wicked cool. Why doesn't corn doesn't completely digest.

"event","Can't really come up with a couple of words to capture everything this weekend, and the last.  Figure I'll just keeping writing till I get it all out, no matter how deep or creative it sounds.  Sometimes you just need to get it out.  I always thought love, or finding a girl was supposed to come in prewrapped packages.  Not opened yet, nice safe wrapping, all the pieces and the directions in the box.  This has to be some kind of chuckle for all the past lives I've had, or some kind of test.  All the past lives I've had, I've always or damn near it, been male.  That's good and dandy and I accept that, and that's were I think I feel that me being hetero would be completely wrong.  Have come to the delightful fact that I enjoy the company of a woman.  The kiss the touch, the voice, the body and the passion and emotions.  And then life throws me a curve ball.  A trannie.   A beautiful woman, soft voice, calming nature, intense but soulfull eyes, who sees something in me that I had no idea was there.  Or at least haven't know for quite some time.  She moves me with her beauty her words, and makes me feel so wanted, and safe and warm and loved.  And then there's her girlfriend, whom I really like, and wouldn't mind getting to be good friends with, cause she's funny and smart and cool!  Never been the kind to date another womans'woman.  Got cheated on enough, never wanted to do it to anyone else.  And even if this is poly, then I don't think I'm cut out for poly.  And then's there's the intimacy that went WAAAAYYYY too far too fast.  Except this beautiful sweet gal has this one part that disgusts me, mortifies me, makes me feel sick and cheap and filthy, and I can't erase that from my mind nor my hand, nor my conscious.  And it sickens her as well, but it was something amazing to her.  Like I finally accepted it and am not afraid.  And it was the best she ever had.  And I can never do that again, and she knows that's likely.  And I still see her as a she, and I see her girlfriend as a she, and I respect and love them both. And she says she loves me so deeply, and I love her, except this fear eats me alive.  I don't want to make her cry, I don't want to leave her side.  And the looks I get from friends just learning about us and embarrassment and shame.  And I hate myself for feeling that but I do.  These looks like, ""um, don't you know she's not quite a she and still has that, and you're doing what with her?  And you like women?""  these looks of shock and disgust.  And just when my mom can deal with me being a lesbian and maybe introducing gwen to her someday.  They would not be right with me dating a trannie.  My brother, my sister, nobody would understand.  What I do see in her.  I love her, but I don't want to hurt her.  Should I have stopped this long before it happened?  To save us both misery?  2 to the head and one to the heart.  That's what I need right now.   What can I offer someone when I can barely get these things for myself?  I can offer compassion and love, but it outways the things I can't.  Understanding, courage, security.    Am sleepy, perhaps in rest, will come dreams to sooth and answer the questions of my soul.

Am tired of the magic show and the parlor tricks, 
In this carnival of seeking ms right,
Promises of a prize, and disappearing acts, 
Seem to be this Lucky Fool's path.

Will come back and work on it tomorrow.  Maybe.  Makes me mad, I actually get excited. My friends get excited for me.  And then ask the next day, ""So??  Didja,....""  And I'm suddenly wearing this HUGE ass dunce hat.  And I have to say, no she didn't show.  And my friends and the bartenders look at me, like some poor dumb wounded creature, just waiting to be finished off by the vultures.  Not smart enough to go die in peace somewhere private.  Can be nice and easy going about it.  'Yeah, it's ok, the music was good, I had an ok time'....And am so numb to disppointment now, it's so much like the over abundance of ice in my drink.  You're gonna get ice, wether you like it or not.  It's gonna be there.  So it doesn't bug me anymore, but somewhere past the ice and the tough outer candy shell, is all the doubt and pity and blue.  Like I'll be some gristly old lesbian who never found ms right. Well, it sits in my belly like a rock tonight, but perhaps in sleep it will digest, and in the morning, I'll crap out the pity and be ok. There's always next weekend."

Distant are your eyes tonight, love.
Always looking past me to some dark forgotten place, 
Where ships lay abandoned, their hulls rotted through.
Where skulls and bones sit frozen in time, 
Picked clean of flesh and spirit, 
By the vultures that dwell in the sea.
And somewhere deep within a metal carcass, 
Sits a young girl, alone, shackled.
With nothing more than a tattered, eyeless doll, 
Clutching it desperately, clinging onto the hope, onto her lost and forgotten joy.
I'm Coming for You.
Across the oceans of your past, 
Diving into the unforgiving waters, 
Plunging down, down, down to where your heart lays.
Punching past the skeletal guards, beating back the carnivors,
Lighting up your dank prison with my shining armor, 
Swinging my sword up high and shattered your restraints, 
Offering a strong and gentle hand, and a warming smile, 
And rising you back up to the sun.
But as we burst free at the ocean's surface, 
Your eyes shut, body limp and comotose, you slip from my grasp.
Sinking like a rock back to your hell. 
At home with the dark and the beasts which devour you.
A Galiant Knight waits at the surface, weeping.
For the girl who does not wish to be saved."

Yet my heart and senses slumber.
Alive men must think me a corpse.
Beatless heart within my chest, breathless lungs take no air.
Yet this rotted puppet to walk and speak among them.
Until she blesses me like the sun to all who live beneath her.
Sudden rush of blood and beat, to such a dry and decrepid organ.
Gales of wind through still and musty lungs.
Her smile, her laughter, her eyes, her lips,
create flesh to my bones and rejoin me among the living.
Taunt me not with life, in such small quantities.
As she leaves, what was so freely given, 
Leaves my body once again, 
To return me to the restless dead."

Step into the sanctuary of my love, 
Push open the dark and woody, furry moss covered doors.
Fingers of sunlight, guiding you inside, birds fluttering.
Past the empty but inviting pews, which, no ones sat at, for quite some time now.
Gaze at the colored glass windows of my imagination.
My church is not like any others you may have stumbled into.
Cold and unforgiving walls, lightless and dank places that force you to worship.
And then make you carry in your own crucifix,
Nailing your own hands and feet, wearing your crown of thorns, 
Left to rot and suffer in your own never-ending sin.
Come to me, my child, my woman, my sister, my love and be healed.
Touch my hand to your head, and my feel my heart against yours.
I absolve you, of all that you've done, and all that has been done against you.
These things have no place, no right, no power in my church, in my arms.
Stand beneath the fountain of my kisses, and be cleansed.
I ask you not to worship me, but to worship yourself, for you are the Goddess as well.
Take my hand in circle, and find her within yourself once again."

Thinking things a little better since the beginning of the week.  A Bear's love is rare thing.  Patient.  Which yes, is hard sometimes.  Respectfull.  which is something never to be compromised.  Giving, not asking.  Which is also hard sometimes.  Only upon acceptance, Ravaging.  Bountiful Bear hugs and Ravaging hungry kisses.  But these things come to me again in sleep and quiet times. Things occassionally forgotten in moments of happy intoxication.   Another bear thing too, solitarity.  I will sleep, I will eat, I will wait in the woods for you, little mouse, until your heart tells you where you need to be.  I won't ask or expect or want more until I know more.

Brief moments, I feel my age sometimes, and know hers and wonder if she sees me as an old lady.  (laughing)  She makes me feel young and silly.  She looks at me and smiles.  And then while I drive, I catch a look on her face.  Her eyes change, her smile drops down and I wonder where she goes for those brief seconds.  Are her demons in the truck with us?  But then she looks at me again and is beaming.  Her heart inspires me, her childlike, spriteful nature and curiousity is beautiful.  And so is she, but I don't think she believes it.  I think I was drunk last night.  Intoxication.  Coke and smokes?  Naw.  Her.  The fun, the energy, the laughter, the playfullness.  Drunk with her and I think I say or do things that only drunk people do.  Mistaking the playfullness or the flirtation for a green light or perhaps a yellow, when the light might not even be there to begin with.  A shoulder or a neck, a snuggle, running my hands through the back of her hair, and at the time, things seem so perfect in the drunken blurr of happy.  I woke up this morning and it felt like a hangover. Not a headache, not the nausea, but the guilt of one's actions.  ""What did I do last night?""  Usually the Virgo in me is the one driving.  After I've been dragged through the gutter of Love too many times, I don't let my heart drive.  The virgo was driving, and the small child of my heart sat in her lap.  She did some donuts and thought she was really driving for a moment.  I need to take the wheel and buckle my heart up again.  I am quite aware of the patience that she requires and am slapping myself on the hands.  But I am also well aware that I may be on this familiar road once again.  The road of unrequited love.  (sighs)  am getting quite used to it, but just need to remind myself that it's there sometimes.  I need to shut the Tap off, put a stopper in my heart, or I will ooze again, like I did last night.  I saw that picture of me that she took.  Hate my picture.  Thought I liked myself ok, but hate my picture.  HUge honking german nose, turkey thing under the chin, my um, girlish figure.  Sometimes feel like Rogue sometimes.  LIke I should be wearing the gloves.  Unable to touch, unable to feel.  Leecherous dark love.  Or like the Hunchback.  I should just walk around like that.  But in the Disney movies, the hunchback gets the cute but misunderstood gal at the ending.  So maybe there's hope for me.  But you know, life sure as hell ain't like a Disney movie.  I can only hope she's not worried about me falling for her.  And wondering what to do with me if I did.  What humane thing to do to a sweet bumbling Bear who falls for a mouse.  Dart to the back of the Head.  For the time Being.  Subdue me.  Subdued me.  It would be nice if there was some freakish chance that she could love a freak like me.  But I'm well aware, that may not be the case.  SO I must cherish the nibbles of her friendship and her heart.  It will have to hold me until I know otherwise."

"event","Grrrr...Scratches head...Can't sleep.  I wish I could be like everyone else and sleep until like 1 in the afternoon.  Ever since getting conditioned to give Pteri (bless his little head) incilin shots at 6am, I've never been able to sleep late.  So here I am again.  I need to go fishing soon.  Had a belly full of catfish last night.  AHhh what a beautiful thing.  But the actual act of fishing is something more beautiful then perhaps even eating it.  It stills you.  Finding the perfect spot, hopefully the lake is empty at first light.  Walking, in quiet thought to your spot.  Listening to the morning chatter of the critters.  Hopefully being blessed to catch a sight of something eating or running across the path.  Finding your spot, connecting the two pieces of pole, like a soldier connecting the parts of his gun.  Hunting.  Never liked the idea of hunting but one night long ago had a dream I was hunting for deer.  Very weird.  Worm on the hook, just enough, and not dangling so the fish, just tug and tug and rip the whole thing off. Cast....Splash....watching the ripples of water go out, and then settle.  It's settling to me.  Talk to the goddess in the waiting.  I get a fish right away, I'm thinking the goddess is either a. not listening and trying to shut me up, b, listening, and about to teach me a lesson to the answer I'm asking. And other times, when the waiting is longer, she's just letting me babble.  Cause I need to.  Ok, enough about fishing.  Momma wants to see my tarot deck.  Never showed that to her.  Very cool to share parts of my life to her.  Hope we talk about me being lesbian again.  that was too cool for words.  OK, I must do something productive today, I vow to throw old socks and undies out today.  Heh, heh...I could sell them on ebay...Some sick bastard would buy them.  That's just wrong in so many ways.  What else should I do today.  Hmm.. Clean the truck.  Yes.  Too much crap in the back.  Ok.  Here we go.  Toodles."

"event","Evening all.  The Bear has come.  Yea, and so it be told the lessons of Bear.  And there was much rejoicing.  Feeling retarded tonight.  Must be the low blood sugar.  I want to love, I want to hold, I want to see you smile, I want you to look in my eyes and not look away in fear.  Stay in my eyes because it's warm and safe there.  I am the Bear, and I will growl and claw and devour anyone who causes you any more pain.  Yet after this rage, comes a calm, a peace.  Rest your head upon my chest, and feel my breath.  Feel the peace I have made with my demons and know I will help you battle yours.  I have the patience of a saint, know this, but inside it's fussing about in the back seat asking, are we there yet?  I want to kiss you.  Soft and gentle...and then all encompassing, all the energy of Bear within me, pulling you into my furry arms, holding you close, kissing you with the fierceness of the wild.  (sighs) ok...am gonna take my meds now, meditate and so forth.  Hope to make you laugh tomorrow.  (Bear smiling)"

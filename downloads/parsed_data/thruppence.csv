"event","wow i havnt written in quite some time now! Ive been sooo busy with school and work and everything. School actually isnt as bad as i thought it was going 2 b.  Thats not saying I love it though! but i am completely inlove w/ my social psychology class!!!!! IT IS AMAZING! yes every1 whos reading this and knows me really well is brobably thinking ""arent u a theater major"" no siree! i changed it after the 1st day! lol! the theater program at fau is a piece of shit! i hate it! lol! so now im majoring in psychology..this is until I switch schools next yr! but even then...who knows maybe ill stay in psych as a double or a minor. i dunno! im still really upset a/b all my friends leaving me but im slowly but surely getting used 2 it! francisco came over yest after i got out of work he was really upset about school and everything ...i was soo happy 2 see him but i was a bad friend 2 him though! and then i realized later that night that i had made plans w another friend as well and i for got 2 call him back....then i also realized i had told another friend i would go 2 his band's show last nigh.....i was on a roll at being an asshole yest! i feel soo bad about it too!  Since sare boob and roach have left i have pretty much been spending all of my time with nick....and dont get me wrong i do have sooo much fun w/ him but i feel like really dependent on him sometimes...and i should have learned from the 3 of them leaving never 2 b dependent on a friend...it just leaves u heart broken in the end.  So tomarrow is a new week and for me it is going 2 be full of new things.  Ive decided that i am going to change many aspects of my life.  i have 2...its not healthy for me to go on like this any more...its not healthy to always be crying or depressed. I have decided that i am going 2 start making purses and clothes and stuff again... its a way of channeling my energy for the better.  And ive decided that i am going 2 stop worrying about what other people do with themselves...they never listen 2 me ne ways so i just get all upset and nothing good comes from it at all!  who really cares if sean is ruining his life by hanging out w/ losers and smoking?!not me ne more....itss not affecting me...so im not goign 2 let it!  ive also decided 2 actually start doing hw! i know how crazy is that?!lol! but no my chemistry class is supposedly one of the 3 hardest classes at my school so im a little nervous...esp b/c i have a really shitty teacher...sean counted yest that the man said okay 200 and something times in a period of 50 min...where do they find these people?! ne ways ive also decided 2 stop talking 2 people who just upset me and bring me down...i dont need it! i dont! im depressed enough as it is and i dont need this shit...from ne 1!well i think ive written a pretty long journal this time..ill write more another day! bye!"

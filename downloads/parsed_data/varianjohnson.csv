"event","So last Saturday, I saw that <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/Saving_Maddie.html""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Saving Maddie</span></a> had been reviewed by <a href=""http://www.kirkusreviews.com/kirkusreviews/index.jsp""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Kirkus</span></a>. I waited patiently--waited for my editor to send me a copy, waited for the review to be posted on <a href=""http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Saving-Maddie/Varian-Johnson/e/9780385738040"">B&amp;N</a> (PW and SLJ are already there), waited for the issue to be available via the online journal database at my university.<br /><br />On the third day, I caved and bought a one-month subscription.<br /><br />But I'm so glad I did. This is arguably the best journal review I've ever received--and here's a snippet:<br /><blockquote>&quot;Johnson avoids heavy-handed messages with nuanced characters and a realistic treatment of Joshua and Maddie's complex relationship.&quot;</blockquote>In fact, here's the only &quot;negative&quot; thing the reviewer says:<br /><blockquote>&quot;Unfortunately, the cover condemns this book to Girls Only.&quot;</blockquote>I'd actually been thinking about this before seeing this review, after recent online discussions with <a href=""http://chasingray.com/"">Collen Mondor</a> about  <a href=""http://www.freymann-weyr.com/atm.html""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">After the Moment</span></a> and after seeing the comments in <a href=""http://campbele.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/book-review-saving-maddie/"">Edi's wonderful review</a>. I realized that during the cover design process, I was so preoccupied with the skin/lip-tone of the cover model, I didn't think about if the cover was &quot;anti-boy&quot;. And I'm NOT saying that the cover is or isn't boy-friendly--but I am admitting that I didn't put as much thought into this as I should have, and will hopefully do better in the future.<br /><br />(Although I think it was due to unusual circumstances--i.e. <a href=""http://justinelarbalestier.com/blog/2009/07/23/aint-that-a-shame/"">the Liar Controversy</a>--that I was even consulted on this cover. And yes, for those that are interested, I have seen all the comments about &quot;is she or isn't she black&quot; and will respond at some point...probably after I see the final cover.)<br /><br />All that being said, this is still a great review. And how am I celebrating? Well, by giving away my last ARC (Advanced Reader's Copy) of <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/Saving_Maddie.html""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Saving Maddie</span></a>.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/uploaded_images/IMG_0824-704447.JPG"" onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}""><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/uploaded_images/IMG_0824-704444.JPG"" style=""margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 309px; height: 400px;"" /></a><br />Looking at my office floor--I mean, bookshelf, I realized that I don't own ARCs of any of my previous books, which in a way is fitting. The ARC isn't for me. It's for librarians and reviewers and booklovers and people like YOU.<br /><br />So if you want an advanced reader's copy of the book before the real thing hits stores on March 9th, just make a comment on my <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/2010/02/kirkus-covers-and-giveaways.html"">webpage blog </a>before 12:00 Midnight CST on Tuesday, Feb 23rd (if you're reading this on Facebook, Livejournal, MySpace, etc--you'll need to go <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/2010/02/kirkus-covers-and-giveaways.html"">here</a> to officially enter). Don't put your email or snail mail address in the comments--just your name--and check back on Wednesday evening to see if you won.<br /><br />Good luck!"

Check back often, as I hope to fit in a few more events between March and July.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve also been thinking a lot about the unsung books of 2009 (started by <a href=""http://yannabe.com/"">Kelly at YAnnabe</a>). I didn&rsquo;t read a whole lot of books in 2009, but many of the ones I really, really, really, really loved and wanted to win awards (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Once Was Lost</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Liar</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Going Bovine</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">How To Say Goodbye in Robot</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Jumped</span>, and  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Marcelo in the Real World</span>) are books that I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly call unsung. But there is one novel that I wish had received a little more attention:   <a href=""http://www.freymann-weyr.com/atm.html""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">After the Moment</span></a> by <a href=""http://www.freymann-weyr.com/"">Garret Freymann-Weyr</a>. <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/uploaded_images/atm-755778.jpg"" onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}""><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/uploaded_images/atm-755768.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 216px; height: 302px;"" /></a> I&rsquo;ve been thinking quite a bit about this novel since I finished it last summer. I also have a postcard for this book, which has the tagline &ldquo;...about a boy who discovers what happens when love fails us--or we fail love,&rdquo; which I think is a perfect way to describe the novel. Sometimes, as much as you want to do the right thing, you just...<span style=""font-style: italic;"">can&rsquo;t</span>. Sometimes, despite wanting to be a good, upstanding, honorable person, you fail the ones you love; the ones that need you most. And, it&rsquo;s just so damn hard to save someone when you have no idea HOW to save one. <br /><br />Perhaps one of the reasons I enjoy this novel so much is because of how similar some of the themes are to <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/Saving_Maddie.html""><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">Saving Maddie</span></a>...which I plan to talk about...eventually.

And those pouty lips were lined in purple lipstick. Not a neon purple, but more like a dark, blue-black mix. Like the color of blackberries.&quot;</blockquote>
I should be posting my Spring speaking schedule sometime at the beginning of the year (psst--I'll be at both <a href=""http://www.ala.org/ala/conferencesevents/upcoming/midwinter/2010/index.cfm"">ALA Midwinter</a> and <a href=""http://www.txla.org/conference/conf.html"">TLA</a>, among other places). I hope everyone has a happy and safe holidays."

Until Maddie comes back to town. Maddie is the daughter of the former associate pastor of Joshua&rsquo;s church, and his childhood crush. Now Maddie is all grown up, gorgeous&mdash;and troubled. She wears provocative clothes to church, cusses, drinks, and fools around with older men. Joshua&rsquo;s ears burn just listening to the things she did to get kicked out of boarding school, and her own home.<br /><br />As time goes on, Josh goes against his parents and his own better instincts to keep Maddie from completely capsizing. Along the way, he begins to question his own rigid understanding of God and whether, as his mother says, a girl like Maddie is beyond redemption. Maddie leads Josh further astray than any girl ever has . . . but is there a way to reconcile his love for her and his love for his life in the church?<br />"

"event","I've never been one for creating New Year's Resolution, but being that I'm too lazy to get some writing done right now, I figured I'd share a few thoughts on what I'm hoping to accomplish next year.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1) Hire someone to update my website:</span> I started my <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/"">website</a> in July of 2005, using good-old html and Notepad. I'm relatively happy with the design, but the source code is a pain to update, and quite frankly, my time is probably better spent writing books than writing code. I'm also hoping to get my blog better integrated into the website.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">2) Spend more time with family and friends: </span>2008 was a killer year. I spent way too many late nights trying to beat a deadline. My schedule looks much, much better this year, mainly because in July I'll...<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">3) Graduate from Vermont College:</span> All my critical work is done (more on this later this month), so now that I'm focusing mainly on my creative work, things should go a lot smoother.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">4) Finish a new novel: </span>Note that I didn't say <span style=""font-style: italic;"">sell</span> a new novel. Don't get me wrong, I fully intend to have another book under contract by the end of the year (hopefully sooner), but much of the hocus-pocus of publishing is out of my control. However, I <span style=""font-style: italic;"">can</span> control what I produce at home, in my office, on my laptop.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">5) Take more chances with my work:</span> I'm itching to do something new, something different, although I don't really know what &quot;new&quot; or &quot;different&quot; is yet. Maybe more short stories. Or a picture book. Or a pop-up book about breasts and man-parts (my classmates will get this).<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">6) Read Octavion Nothing 1 and 2.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">7) Do a better job at cheering on other authors:</span> I sometimes get so wrapped up in what I'm trying to accomplish, I forget about what other authors are trying to do. There are some really great authors out there, and I want to make sure that they get their time in the spotlight.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">8) Finish a joint-project with a classmate:</span> One of my classmates and I have been talking about working on a joint MG project for almost a year now, and mostly because of me, it hasn't gone much further than a few outlines and sample pages. I'm hoping that as things calm down, we'll be able to work on this novel.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">9) Find the drive to </span><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">consistently</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> get up at 5:00 in the morning: </span>Ever since I turned in my last round of edits for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Saving Maddie</span>, I've been reluctant to get up in the morning for my usual writing routine. My goal this year is to get up and out of the house by 5:50 AM at least four days a week. This would give me almost two hours of fresh writing time before work. (And look for another post in a few months concerning motivation.)<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">10) Clean up my office</span>: Seriously, it hasn't been cleaned, dusted or vacuumed in over a year. My desk is covered with papers, books, and random receipts. Mrs. V won't even stop foot inside my office at this point.<br /><br />Hmm...on second thought, maybe that isn't such a bad thing.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Happy 2009!</span>"

"event","A little over a year ago, I, along with four of my colleagues in the kid-lit industry, joined together to form <a href=""http://thebrownbookshelf.com/"">The Brown Bookshelf</a> &ndash; an online community charged with highlighting both established and up-and-coming African-American children&rsquo;s and YA authors and illustrators. Our 2008 - 28 Days Later Campaign was a huge success, and I&rsquo;m happy to announce that we&rsquo;re now accepting submissions and nominations for <a href=""http://thebrownbookshelf.com/28-days-later"">28 Days Later &ndash; 2009</a>. <br /><br />As our new campaign began to ramp up, I found myself thinking a lot about the role of The Brown Bookshelf. Were we making enough of an impact? What additional programs should we be pushing? Had we outgrown our usefulness? <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/uploaded_images/Hotlanta-769263.jpg""><img alt="""" border=""0"" style=""float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/uploaded_images/Hotlanta-769253.jpg"" /></a>As I contemplated these and many other questions, I was directed to a <a href=""http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6593578.html"">Publishers Weekly essay</a> by <a href=""http://www.thisispoint.com/authors/denenemillner.asp"">Denene Millner</a>, co-author of the &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.thisispoint.com/books/hotlanta.asp"">Hotlanta</a>&rdquo; series. In the essay, Millner notes the dearth of books for African-American teens, stating, &ldquo;Very few prolific authors have enjoyed consistent, successful careers writing about black teen life, and only a handful of publishing houses have dedicated their resources to publishing black teen books. And once those books are released, good luck finding them in bookstores or reviewed in the media.&rdquo; Specifically, Millner points out the gluttony of &ldquo;street fiction&rdquo; on bookshelves, and implores publishing houses to publish &ldquo;more books about and for African-American teens, and not tomes about slavery, the ghetto and growing up in impossible conditions. I'm talking books with modern, hip stylings and everyday stories that address teen issues in a way that speaks to the audience in their own language.&rdquo; <br /><br />I&rsquo;ve stated before my surprise, and disappointment, when teens shout out that their favorite authors are Zane and Eric Jerome Dickey. Truthfully, Zane and Eric Jerome Dickey may be okay for some students. However, I&rsquo;d love to go into a school one day and hear a teen say that his or her favorite author is <a href=""http://www.coebooth.com/"">Coe Booth</a> or <a href=""http://www.ritawg.com/"">Rita Williams-Garcia</a> or <a href=""http://www.dramahigh.com/"">L. Divine</a>. <br /><br />And, I think this can happen, because teens that read novels by these authors love their books. The key is&mdash;how do we get these books into the hands of the readers? Libraries are our primary lifeline to these students, but is there another way to reach these readers? Can we&mdash;authors, publishers, booksellers, and parents&mdash;do more? <br /><br />But as Millner&rsquo;s essay reminded me, sometimes it&rsquo;s not just the end reader that we need to support. Milliner states: <br /><br />&ldquo;&hellip;I'm not as confident about what can be done to improve the morale of authors like me, who are weary from the mess that has become black fiction. I can't tell you how painful it is to have my books&mdash;particularly a teen book&mdash;dismissed as street fiction because the cover features black girls.&rdquo; <br /><br />African-American authors are a dying breed, a breed which I fear may become extinct if we don&rsquo;t do a better job of supporting both established and emerging talent. That&rsquo;s why 28 Days Later is so important. We need books not just for African-American children and teens, but we need books&mdash;well-written, diverse books&mdash; written and illustrated by African Americans. <br /><br />So please, drop by the site today and <a href=""http://thebrownbookshelf.com/28-days-later"">nominate an author or illustrator</a>. And remember: well-written, entertaining books aren&rsquo;t just a benefit for certain ethnic groups. They&rsquo;re a benefit to the entire industry. And most importantly, good, well-written, diverse books provide the greatest benefits to our end users&mdash;children and teens all across the world. <br />"

I think I kinda-sorta know the general structure of the thesis, but I'll know better once I fill in a few pieces. I've done a fair amount of research, although I have a ton more to do--which is one of the reasons why I'm not posting the topic of my thesis--at least, not yet. Once I get through a first draft, then I'll feel more confident about what I'm writing about. <br /><br />On the <strong>RIGHTEOUS</strong> front, I chatted with my editor, Stephanie Lane, last week, and it looks like the novel will be coming out on the <a href=""http://www.randomhouse.com/kids/index.pperl"">Delacorte</a> Spring 2010 line (I know the tentative release month, but I ain't telling). Now, I know that seems like a long time away, but I promise, it isn't. Plus, if any of you read my <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/2008/07/mr-v-explains-last-six-months-of-his.html"">bumbling, rambling post from last week</a>, you'll see that I could stand to use a little extra time before the novel comes out. <br /><br />What else...a few people have called me out concerning the Alumni Award that I was given at the past Vermont College Residency. It's not that I was ignoring talking about it--it's just that I always feel strange talking about awards like this. Seriously, I can think of so many people that do so much for the program that deserve this recognition at least as much as I do--if not more. That being said, I am extremely honored and humbled, and I hope that I can live up to the ideals of the awards. <br /><br />On the writing front, I'm working furiously on a new project that I'll call <strong>JG</strong> for now. I've workshopped it a few times, and uber-agent Sara has seen the first forty-or-so pages of it. It's a bit of a departure from my other work, but at this point in my career, I wanted to try something different. <br /><br />My career. I have a writing career. God, it feels good to say that. <br /><br />I hope everyone is having fun doing what he or she is supposed to be doing in life. At least for today, I know that I am.&nbsp;"

"event","Perhaps a better title for this post would be, ""Where the hell have you been? You haven't been blogging. You haven't been calling? What's wrong?"" <br /><br />Just as a recap, here a taste of what was going on with me during the past six months: <br /><br />1) <em><a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/rhombus.html"">My Life as a Rhombus</a></em> came out. <br />2) I spent the better part of February doing school visits, booksigning, and book festivals. <br />3) I started a new semester at <a href=""http://www.vermontcollege.edu/mfawc/index.asp"">Vermont College</a>. <br />4) In addition to my Vermont College work, I also worked on getting another manuscript ready for submission. <br />5) At <a href=""http://thebrownbookshelf.com/"">the Brown Bookshelf</a>, we kicked off our <a href=""http://thebrownbookshelf.com/28-days-later/"">28 Days Later Campaign</a>. <br /><br />On top of all of that stuff: <br /><br />6) I still have a full-time job. And believe me, designing bridges isn't the easiest thing in the world to do. <br />7) And on top of all of that, I still have a wife and a house and two dogs. And a mother and a father and a brother and a sister and nieces and nephews and in-laws. <br /><br />So I'm going to be totally honest here. The last six months were murder. Seriously. There were some mornings where I didn't think I had the energy--both physical and mental--to pull myself out of bed, much less make it through the day. There were some nights where I worked on writing stuff until 5 o'clock in the morning, took a two-hour power nap, and then went to work. <br />There were some nights were I didn't even have two spare hours for a nap. <br /><br />So, I had to give some things up. First on the list--blogging. That was pretty easily to do, actually. As much as I missed it, I figured that I could always pick it up when I needed to. <br /><br />The second thing was much harder to give up. I pretty much became a social hermit, cutting off ties with many of my friends. My thought was that if my friends were real friends, then they'd understand, and they'd still be there when things calmed down. I still believe that to be the case. <br /><br />And family life was...<em>strained</em>. And I'll leave it at that. <br /><br />But, you know what--it's July. And I'm still here. And so are my friends. And so is my family. And so is my job. And so is this blog. <br /><br />I thought about taking a semester off from the program for a brief second, before pushing that thought out of my mind. Now, I know a lot of people take semesters off, and there's nothing wrong with that. But in my case, I needed to push through. I needed Vermont College. More than anything, for those that don't understand writing--for those that see it as something easy, as a hobby, as something not worthy of blood and sweat and tears--Vermont College gave me a legitimate reason to write. <br /><br />And it paid off. <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/2008/04/path-of-righteous.html"">We sold a book to Delacorte</a>. <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/rhombus.html""><em>Rhombus</em> did (and continues to do) really well</a>. Rita was pleased with my VC work. And I even wrote a picture book. <br /><br />And you know what else? I'd do it all over again. In a heartbeat. Without thinking twice. <br /><br />I am a writer. As much as I wish otherwise, it's more than a job. It is more than a passion. It's a way of life for me, and for better or worse, it's who I am now. If there's one thing that I've learned from Vermont College, it's that. <br /><br />Another thing that I've learned is that I'm going to be honest from now on about my writing. I write. It's important to me. Plain and simple--I want a writing career. <br /><br />More importantly, there's nothing <em>wrong</em> with wanting a writing career. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be successful and get paid to do what you love to do. <br /><br />Now, a writing career means a lot of different things, which I'm still trying to define. And, I'm not saying that I'm plan to march into my job tomorrow and quit--I promise, that's the last thing I want to do. (Plus, engineering is a big part of who I am as well. I'm not sure if I could give that up.) <br /><br />All I'm really saying is that, for a long time, I side-stepped and avoided talking about what I really wanted out of writing. I marginalized and belittled it. It wasn't a real career...it was just something I did on the side. <br /><br />Well, those days are over. My name is Varian Johnson, and I'm a writer. And I'm not ashamed to say that I think I'm finally starting to get the hang of it. <br /><br />So, while this post seems to have gotten a little off-topic, I'm going to post it anyway. And while I'm at it, I really need to give a special shout-out to my Vermont College Class--<a href=""http://storybookgirl.blogspot.com/2008/07/about-that-class-name.html"">The Super Secret Society of Quirk and Quill</a>, to <a href=""http://cynthialeitichsmith.blogspot.com/2008/07/awesome-austin-writers-workshop.html"">the Awesome Austin Writer's Workshoppers</a>, to my critique group (<a href=""http://www.aprillurie.com/"">April</a>, <a href=""http://www.helenhemphill.com/Site/Home.html"">Helen</a>, <a href=""http://www.brianyansky.com/"">Brian</a>, Frances, and <a href=""http://www.julielake.com/"">Julie</a>), and to my advisor, <a href=""http://www.ritawg.com/"">Rita Williams-Garcia</a>, and to <a href=""http://www.cynthialeitichsmith.com/"">Cynthia</a>, for just being <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/2007/10/more-good-stuff.html"">Cynthia</a>. A lot of people don't understand the writing life, but y'all do. Thank you for being there when I needed to bitch and moan and complain. <br /><br />The next six months are going to suck, but not nearly as bad. I've got a critical thesis to write. I have a new novel I'm working on. I have to get edits in for RIGHTEOUS pretty soon. And I'd actually like to spend some time with Mrs. V. <br /><br />Okay, so enough with the backstory. There you have it. Perhaps a little personal, but sometimes it's okay to be personal, right? <br /><br />Or maybe I'm still feeling all touchy-feely from Vermont. It can have that effect on you, you know.&nbsp;<br />"

"event","I hate starting a new project. Every time I start something new, the following thoughts pop into my head: <br /><br />1) Why am I doing this? I don't get paid enough to be this miserable. <br />2) I'm such a hack. No wonder ____ said _____ about my last book. <br />3) I could write a novel about ___, but ___ has already done it. <br />4) I could write a novel about _____, but ____ could do it so much better than I could. <br />5) I should write something funny. <br />6) I should write something serious. <br />7) I should write a fantasy novel. Yeah, <em>Hakim Potter at the Deathly Ghettos</em>. <br />8) I should write a middle grade, so that I can win a Newbery. <br />9) I should write an adult novel. That way I could be on Oprah. <br />10) I should just quit while I'm ahead. <br /><br />Eventually I'm able to push through these thoughts and get something down on paper. Sometimes it just takes a while. A long while. <br /><br />In other news, I wish I had something more to add about <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/blog/2008/04/path-of-righteous.html"">the sale</a>, but really, there isn't much more to say, at least not now. My editor feels pretty confident that we can get the revisions done in enough time to make the Fall 09 schedule. I'll be sure to let y'all know when something exciting happens. <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/rhombus.html"">Rhombus</a> continues to do well--thanks to everyone who's purchased the book or requested it from the library or posted a positive comment about it.

"event","Just checking in to post a few updates:<br /><br />1) New reviews: We got <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/rhombus.html#reviews"">good reviews</a> from both KLIATT and <a href=""http://www.theedgeoftheforest.com/young_adult.shtml"">The Edge of the Forest</a>. I especially love this part of The Edge of the Forest review:<br /><br />""Johnson's book strikes a good balance; it's gripping and sensitive at the same time. It doesn't oversimplify; it doesn't pull punches. And, perhaps most importantly, it does not pass judgment.""<br /><br />I love that readers and reviewers ""get this"" about <strong><em>Rhombus</em></strong>. It gives me faith that I did something right.<br /><br />2) Updated website: I've added a couple of pages to the website -- a dedicated <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/calendar.html"">calendar </a>page and a page on <a href=""http://www.varianjohnson.com/authorvisits.html"">school visits</a>. If you see any misspellings, please let me know.<br /><br />3) On the Vermont College front, I wrote my first picture book last month. It started off at about 1500 words, and by the time I submitted it, I had cut it down to 1070. Now Rita wants me to trim off at least 200 more words.<br /><br />4) Among the many books that I read last month, the one that stood out the most was E. L. Konigsburg's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/View-Saturday-E-L-Konigsburg/dp/0689817215""><em>A View from Saturday</em></a>. I'm not quite convinced that it has a plot, but I don't care. It's a great story. I see why it won the Newbery.<br /><br />5) I hit the big 3-1 today. I celebrated by filling out paperwork that I had neglected for the past month.<br /><br />6) Congratulations to both <a href=""http://www.paulayoo.com/"">Paula Yoo</a> and <a href=""http://www.sarazarr.com/"">Sara Zarr</a> for getting nominated for the <a href=""http://www.ala.org/ala/yalsa/booklistsawards/bestbooksya/titlesnominated.cfm"">2009 ALA BBYA list</a>. Of course, they're both great writers, so I'm not surprised in the least.<br /><br />7) Thanks to everyone that saw me at all of my book signings and at the <a href=""http://www.scbookfestival.org/"">South Carolina Book Festival</a>. And thanks for buying books!<br /><br />8) Likewise, I had a great time talking to the students at Darlington High School and at <a href=""http://www.wiredforyouth.com/secondchance/author.cfm"">Gardner Betts</a> last month. Talking to those kids reminded me why I started writing in the first place.<br /><br />Okay, back to work!"

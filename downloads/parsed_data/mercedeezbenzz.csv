"event","Hi, everyone!

Today we&#39;ll talk about the Internet anonymity. There is a good idea to use the SOCKS proxy instead of direct connection. One can find proxy lists via google, but these links are mostly dead. However I know the one of really <a href=""http://free.billproxy.com"" target=""_blank"">free proxy list</a> web-site. Another way is to subscribe on <a href=""http://billproxy.net"" target=""_blank"">private version</a> of that site and use the socks proxies from the more that 100 countries."

"event","<p>My condolences go out to everyone that has lost their pet and trusted that these sick individuals would take care of out faithful friend(s) and treat them with the up most respect that&nbsp;they deserved. May we find some small comfort in knowing&nbsp; ""What goes around comes around"".<br /><br />My parents lost their beloved Golden Retriever this Summer. Kiefer was only eight years old and he suddenly got sick what seemed like overnight. He was immediately taken to the vet and after going through the various tests it was determined that he had a tumour in his Kidney. He received surgery and seemed to be doing well for the first week, appearing to return to normal despite his lengthy incision and some discomfort. Unfortunately it did not last, and he took a turn for the worse where once again he was rushed to the vet for treatment where it was&nbsp;then determined that he had another tumour that was in his lung. My parents were absolutely devastated at this news, considering his young age, and how he went from being an active healthy dog, to a deterioting shell in a matter of weeks.&nbsp;<br />The decision was finally made to put him to rest due to his suffering and to have him cremated through the vet clinic, which unfortunately dealt with Misty Gardens.</p><p>My parents were devasted as any pet owner is when they lose their pet, and the comfort of having Kiefer home with them was something that was so important for them to cling to. I still remember the day mom got the call to pick up his urn and she told me that she was ""Bringing him home"".....Several weeks later, the horror of Misty Gardens unfolded. </p><p>We were so stunned, and we didn't know what to do and still don't in some ways. My parents were so distraught and still are,&nbsp; that they could not come to pursue any course of action, whether it came to identifying the remains in the urn, following up with Conservation, or being a voice. Guilt&nbsp; was also a factor that came into affect by mom as she decided to take him to a different vet instead of the one we had used for years as it was a closer location and&nbsp;was recommended by a friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own grief, sorrow and fears about finding out what really happened to our pet unfortunatly got in the way of facing the reality of this nightmare. We wanted to believe that Kiefer was in that urn and that he was maybe one of the lucky ones that was cared for properly.&nbsp;<br /><br />After having some time to grieve and deciding that I can no longer sit back quietly in the hopes that it will go away, I decided that I need to pursue some answers&nbsp;for&nbsp;my family and for Kiefer's memory.<br /><br />Therefore I want to personally thank all of you fine people on here that have volunteered their advice and have spoken out for all these wonderful pets, and for people that didn't have the strength&nbsp;at the time to do so like us.&nbsp;&nbsp;You all should&nbsp;feel proud of the the effort you have put forward.&nbsp;<br /><br />We will probably never know if we have our Kiefer back, but it's very comforting and an honor to know&nbsp;that if he is out there with one of you&nbsp; he will be well taken care of.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our family and Kiefer (R.I.P. Kee) are extremely grateful<br /><br />Thanks again<br />&nbsp;<br />Lisa <br /><br /></p>"

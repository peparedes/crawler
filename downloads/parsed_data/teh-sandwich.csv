"event","<font face=""Comic Sans MS""> Seriously. Seems I rarely update. Probably because there's so little to put in these updates. Or, rather, there's little that is worth updating and that I actually let people see. I mean, my life hasn't been boring or uneventful, but it still seems pointless, maybe even counterproductive, to update with the events that happen. I don't know why I'm even updating now. LiveJournal has lost the spark that attracted me to it. I not only rarely update, but I rarely check to see if my friends have updated. Most everyone posts all the important stuff in their MySpace blogs... Well, I'd assume that it's important. Don't really know, I'm not on anyone's preferred list, so I can't see what's in those blogs. The other ones never seem as important though. Kind of. Some of the time they do, but usually, it's just some blog fad. I'm really bored right now. Still don't have a job yet, so I don't have anywhere to go during the day. I also don't have any money. I need to get a quick $200 for a few months from now, but other than that, I'd probably just waste the rest of the money on videogames. And anime. And manga. Well, I guess I'll end this, before I end up ranting.<br></wall of text><br><br>Sandwich, signing out."

I've got nothing else to do today, so I might as well. I'm counting on at least one of the three M's to appear. Shall someone cause a bit of mischief and give someone else a spook? Will mayhem throw the dance into complete disarray? Might malice torment someone's soul? Is this dance to be a waste of my time? Can breaking a mirror really cause seven years of bad luck? Do pigs fly? Should I stop asking questions? We'll find out the answer to all of these... TONIGHT! DU~N DU~N DU~~N!"

But not nice little letters and post cards, nor are they bills and taxes, and I'd rather a ""You may have won $X"" but what I'm getting is invitations to colleges. Just today I got an offering to Case Western Reserve University. A few days ago, I got a letter in school that said I was going to be put in ""Who's Who"".<br><br>I don't mind being offered invitations to different colleges. On the contrary, it makes my search for one easier, though I think I'll probably stick with UAT. But I wish these people would make some attempt at finding my interests and such before sending me an invitation. If I get another invitation to a law school, so help me I'll...<br><br><center>End Transmission</center>"

Each year it seems more and more like a regular day.<br><br>Today started off normal. Got up. Opened my gift. Went to church. Came home. Spent a half hour trying to tune the guitar. Went to granparents' house for Christmas party. Came home. Spent another 10 minutes trying to tune guitar. Somehow learned Epona's song and Zelda's lullaby, on what was probably an out-of-tune guitar. Typed this up.<br><br>Hopefully I'll be able to get my guitar tuned properlly, but since I'm tone deaf...<br><br>Oh yeah. Merry Christmas, jerks (j/k).

"event","<font face=""Comic Sans MS""><center>It's time to transmit!</center><br>I just finished making my best YGO TCG Tournament-legal deck. It focuses mainly on directly getting my opponents LP down to 0 in any way it can. Mostly through monsters that can attack LP directly. It also contains strong low-level monsters (such as ""Harpie's Brother"" [ATK: 1800] and ""Seven Colored Fish"" [ATK: 1800]) and monsters of high defense, along with many lowlevel monsters meant for tributing. I won't write down every card in it, because I'm both too lazy and I don't want to give away any secrets. So if you want to know the general layout of my deck, you'll need to duel me.<br><br><center>I end my transmission</center>"

I heard so much good news today- well, it wasn't a lot actually, only about two or three things, but it is the quality and not quanity that counts. Either way though, I'm going to take it all with a grain of salt, and just hope I don't end up worse off.<br><br>One thing I heard was that Chaney failed the health inspection. Surprise, surprise. The glory is that that means that we may have all of next week off while they clean up. The school scored negative points apparently, so things are looking up. Of course, we may still end up having school. I just hope they don't end up having to tear the entire school down and send us somewhere else. That would mean adjusting to a new school and possibly not seeing old friends again.<br><br>So with everything I heard about things and people, there is about 33.33, uh, repeating of course, percent of things turning out perfectly. Well, it's better than usual.<br><br><center>End Transmission</center>"

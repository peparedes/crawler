i went to sign into my facebook and it seems my account has been disabled by an administator. WTF?!?!&nbsp; i did nothing wrong.&nbsp;

well my work will be a bit slack this week ""knock on wood""&nbsp; I had Monday off, work 11-6 on tuesday, 115-915 on wednesday, off thursday and work friday and off saterday.&nbsp; usually i only get two days off a week but since i had worked labour day and didnt get my 3 days off that week (i guess i was supposed to?) so i get 3 off this week.&nbsp; we have a new girl atwork now, Ruby.&nbsp; she is pretty cool, new to canada tho so her english isnt great. but she is pretty good with the customers. so now there is Lisa, S the manager, Me the AMIT (assistant manager in training) then there is Ruby the other fultimer,&nbsp; Lisa W, my sister and part time worker and Lavonna the other part timer.&nbsp; so technically it is a full staff but it would be nice to get another person in to pick up some of the slack.&nbsp; Im starting to get more responsibilities at work which i like. paperwork right now. wahoo. lol&nbsp; its not bad tho, gives me a chance to chill in the back room and clear my head.&nbsp;
oh yea, my&nbsp; boss has a super cool sence of humour so its awesome. good atmosphere(most of the time) oh and i got a raise! only 50 cents but its a start :P its retroactive tho so it wont show up till probaly next cheque. oh well a lil extra moolah will be nice.&nbsp;

well, other then work nothing is worth really writing about, all i do is work work work then housework and sleep. i need to get out and do stuff, come on TJ and Rach!&nbsp; heh. all in due time i guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;

1am, work in 10 hrs, i guess ill get some sleep.&nbsp;

goodnite!

"event","<p><strong><font size=""3"">well this is just a smidge overdue.&nbsp; oh well not like anyone will read this.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well work was going well, keyword: <em>was&nbsp;. </em>Then came thanksgiving, i was supposed to have the day off but i got called in.&nbsp; So it was a busy busy day and i was doing a million things at once, and i was in the back room gettin a box down and i fell off the ladder.&nbsp; 5 feet backwards off a ladder. so i landed on my left arm and my butt. I got up and told the manager, arm was horribly painful but i finsished the shift, then i had the next day off so i went to the doctor(walkinn) and he said to take a few days off. so i called my boss and told her this, she was notedly mad but oh well. so i was off and it still hurt, so i went to my family doctor and he was rather worried and sent me for xrays.&nbsp; I also was told to take atleast a week off. so i called the boss and told her and she was mad but said okay. well the xrays came back on a monday and no break so i called to say i would be back on wednesday( lil less then a week later) so yea i went to work for light duty, Hah! what a joke.&nbsp;i was on my own for 4.5 hrs and while i was alone i did all the routine crap, pre pays, transfers, email checking, message checking and selling shoes and such,&nbsp; anyway when scrolling thru the emails and i saw my name,&nbsp; so as most people would do if they see there name on a Company all access computer.&nbsp; So i read it and basically this is what it said&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />mind you this is not quoted cuz i dont have the original<br /><br /><em>Hey Cheif, sorry to bother you with petty problems when you have much more important things to do. But Michelle called in again and supposedly her doctor told her to take more time off and for xrays, and if they are positive she wont be back for awhile.&nbsp; my question to you is.&nbsp; she has only been here 4-6 weeks maybe, so do i have any obligation to her or can i FIRE HER WHINEY ASS.&nbsp;&nbsp; waiting to hear from you.</em></font></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><font size=""3"">so need less to say i was damn pissed off!&nbsp; there were 3 emails like that all to her bosses.&nbsp; so i worked out the day and pushed to hard and hurt bad.&nbsp; so that nite i went home and called work and left a message saying that i would need more time off cuz it was just too much.&nbsp; so the next morning she calls me up to get my BC Med Number cuz she was just then fillin out the workers comp forms ( i already had 3 forms from doctors in there) and at the end of the convo she said, ""so you will call me when you can come back?"" and i said ""yes probally in a week""&nbsp; so i thought all was okay untill today i get all these texts from my co worker saying i am not on the shedual and that i should call the boss to see if i was still employed there.&nbsp; so i called WCB and asked there opinion and they said they hadnt recived the forms from the employer yet so they cant accept the claim yet.&nbsp; so then i called my boss because i know they are damn swamped at work i called and said ""Hi, its michelle, i was informed that i am not on the shedual for the next 2 weeks, if you still want me i can start again on LIGHT duty wednesday or thursday"" she replied ""umm, no thats okay, ill keep the shedual as is and you can call me on Nov. 3 to see when we can work ya in""&nbsp; im sittin here like what the flying mother fucker???&nbsp; but i kept my cool and finished the convo.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If you havent guessed yet, i want to either quit or be fired from that mother fucking job but i cant because i am on WCB. GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br /><br />oh and also, i was hired there promised full time hours and training to be assistant manager, but for the few weeks befor the accident they cut my hours wayy down like maybe 50 per 2&nbsp;weeks.&nbsp; and i have gotten noo training for assistant manager, and then i saw that they have a ad up at guest services hiring a assistant manager,&nbsp; ohh and when the head boss asshole was here he took both me and my co worker aside (btw we were told we were both the assistant manager) anyway when he took me aside he told me that he could see me with the company for alooong time and that he was tryin to get rid of the other girl and make me the sole assistant manager. so i was stoked for that.&nbsp; and then the other day i was back to work the other girl and i were talkin and she said he had said the exact fucking thing to her too.&nbsp;&nbsp; fuckin i hate people!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So ya, anyone wanna give me a job? heh, im find one soon i hope.&nbsp; but i dont know if i can quit or be fired or what, so if anyone does read this, pleasse give me advice!!!!<br /><br />okay well enuf for tonite,&nbsp; buh bye<br /><br />oh ya and i royally fucked up my knee tonite.&nbsp; crap</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size=""3""></font></strong></p><p><strong><font size=""3"">Michelle<br /><br />oh and to top it off my boyfried dumped me.&nbsp; yay life</font></strong></p>"

I work, come home, hang out. ya thats about it. 
I did buy myself a brand new kick ass laptop. its tottaly tubular dude. 

I thought I had something to say, but really i dont.

Wow,  I just had a vivid memory.  Sitting on Rachels porch off the family room up on Franklyn. Sitting there, at nite, wind blowing genally, the creepy fake owl hooting at nothing,  confrontation all around and the lonelyness over whelming. Thats how i feel theses days, sure i am around peopel most of the time, but the incredibal loneliness building inside me is unbearable.  

my birthday is in 19 days, i do not know what i want. oh well,  its just another passing year, big deal."

"event","well, i was informed that i havent updated in awhile.  so here is one.

so, i dropped off a resume on a friday,thinkin nothing would come of it. got a call for interview on monday, had an interview on tuesday, got a call i was hired on wednesday, started work on thursday.  
I work at Liquidation World,  not a very high class place, but the people seem nice, and hey, im making money. so whatever, its not permanent, just till i get some money and a better job.

So far i have worked 4 hrs on thursday, 6 hrs on friday, and tommorow well today now, i work 7 hrs. Really all i do is stock shelves, make sure everthing is in its place and price stuff. pretty damn boring. but occasionally i get called up to cashier assist. which is basically helpin the cashier by putting the items in bags and anything eles she needs.  In a few weeks i will be trained as a cashier, im almost wondering if i really want to be a cashier, cuz it can get rather stressfull and what im doin now is pretty slack.  It is nice to have a job where you are actually allowed to take a break, actually im supposed to take a 15 minute break after 2 hrs, if on a 4 hr shift, and a half hr break or 2 15 minute breaks. I am curious if i get 1 half hr break and a 15 min on a 8 hr.  I doubt that makes sence to anyone, too many numbers and such. 

anyyyyyyyyyyyyway  on to my personal life,  oh wait... i dont have one!  

i want to go swimmin!  maybe on my next day off i will. i hope so. ohh and sit in a hot tub, mmmmmm.
I have been gettin massages lately, because my friend is taking a massage course at the college, and she needs case studies. so that means free massages for me!  man i could use one right now.  

i am drinking hot choclate, but not just hot chocolate. Hot Chocolate with Vanilla, Chocolate and a smidge of Strawberry Ice Creams. yummm.  

I think my parents are going to buy me a carpet, cuz my room is just cement.  so that will be good. 

well, i think thats all i have to say for now.  
have a good rest of weekend everyone.

"event","Okay, so im updating because a few ljers told me they would read it, so if they dont ill be right pissy :P:P
<lj-cut>
okay, so friday was my mums birthday, i shall not disclose the age because thats rude supposedly, even tho none of you know her, well thats not true, 2 of the 3 people who replied to my entry last nite actually know her, so hmm. if you have some strange fasination with my mums age, ask and ill tell ya. 

anyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy whoooooooooooom 

so my dad as some of you may know is a gardener/landscaper. He mainly works for really rich people around kelowna and the westside. anyway, he has this one client whom is very nice, and she lives in a really nice house with like 6 bedrooms and a hot tub and nice tv and such. she only lives there about 2 months of the year (a summer home if you will) since my dad has known her for awhile, and she knows we dont have alot of money, she told him that he could use her house as an occasional escape. instead of having to pay for a hotel or soemthing. anyway, it was moms b day, so they decided to take the lady up onm her offer and go there for the weekend. thus leaving us kiddies home alone for the 2 days. 

so they left on friday afternoon, and my lilest bro and sis (again if you know me you will know there names, and if you dont know me and know there names, ummmmm creepy) okay, so they were going to a campout/in with their youth group, so it would just be me and ryan and a empty house for the night (note ryan is my 23 year old brother, so get yur minds outta the gutter!! ewww) so yes, the afternoon of friday, mom and dad took us out for chinese food. my FAVORITE food.  so all was good and we were just about to order and we hear a boomsizzle!  and then the lights went out.  it was okay tho, because since we were the only people in the resturant at the time the cook cooked in the dark for us. okay so ya, we had a bunch of leftovers.   so friday for lunch i had chinese food and for dinner chinese food. 

So friday nite, home alone.  I would tell you about the amazingly radicallly awesome party we had,  only one problem.  we dodmnt have a party.  yep thats right,  i sat home, watching tv, playin computer games, drinkin hot chocolate, and talkin on the phone to my uncles who called, 3 diffrent ones, all drunk, to wish mom a happy b day. fuuun stuff!  hahah,  near 11 o clock i did have a Rum and Coke tho...   my bro and sister were supposed to call to check in, but never did, so i barely slept cuz i was to have the phone by my bed incase something happened and they called,  so i didnt sleep because i  am a deep sleeper, so if i was asleep and they called i wouldnt of heard it, so i didnt sleep, and they didnt call. 

note: i just realized that i have started almost every section with so.  yikes! isnt that like a rule not to do in english? heh sorry jordan.

so yea :P  saterday came and we had to go buy mom a gift, and have money left for pizza.  we went out and got her a nice bathset witha cute lil teddy, and still had money left for snacks,  when i say we i mean me and my bros and sis.  anyway, we went to the store and each got a bag of chips (mine is still unopened in my drawer) and each a bottle of pop.  and then i got a iced coffee and we came home. lisa and i started wrappin moms gift and the telephone rang, Mission Park Florists has a delivery for (insert moms name here)  so we waited around for them to come, 45 mins after theysaid they would be there.  so finally they came, and it was a really nice arangment but the card wasnt signed.  i was tempted to put my own name on it,  but i resisted.  so i had to figure what to do with these flowers, because since i have never recived flowers (Hint Hint!! *Cough Cough May 26 Cough Cough*)  so i just put them in some water still all nicely pakaged and took pictures of them, just incase i killed em befor mom got em (btw i didnt, they are still alive)  so then i wrapped moms gift all pretty like, and realized shit i forgot a card!  so id have to set up the printer and make one.   then the pizza came and i forgot aboot the card,  i have a new fav pizza tho. mmm canadaian!  after pizza i basically did nothing, well i cleaned, and then re cleaned. wahoo.  and at 1am, i remeberd i need a card! so i was up till about 3 am making a card. it was a damn nice card tho.  then i went to bed.  

okay, i know how boring this entry is, so ill spare you all and just finish a quick recap. 

sunday afternoon, parents came home, i went shopping with dad, and he bought me coffee. then we came home ate pizza and watched the Oscars, snoooooooooze.  then i just hung out and went to bed. 

monday,  took sister to waxin place, went to the store, dropped off resumes, came home, chatted online.  oh and the idiots across the street were using a bobcat thingy to do something in their front yard, and they hit a water line,  so there was a lil fountain for a bit.  the yard is still all dug up and shit.

alrite, well thats all for now,  sorry for boring you all. 

Michelle"

"event","so heres the update you have alllll been waiting for. HAHA. 

I had my PSP interview and dexterity test yesterday, i think it went well, but im usually not the best judge of that kinda thing. I will find out within a few weeks if i got the job.  so after the interview i went outside and realized Vicky wouldnt be there for awhile, so i just hung out. I heard a big noise, and the next thing i knew a huge ass train was goin by like 5 feet infront of me. 21 boxcars behind it, it was cool! Then I walked along the traintracks for a bit, till Vicki showed up.  I told her i was a BeanScene virgin, so she insisted we go there. We went down to the bean scene, and on the drive there she was tryin to teach me where in town we were, cuz sad but true, i do NOT know my way around this town. Hell ive only been here for what 18 and a half years?  wow it seems long. crazy. 

-side note, does anyone know how old you have to be to go get a BC ID without a parent? please let me know

Okay, so we got to The Bean Scene and got some hot choclates and cookies (ill pay you back) and we sat and just talked, next thing i knew at least an hour and a half had passed! I loved it, jsut hanging out with someone new, and we have alot in common, which is awesome! So after the bean scene, we were just drivin downtown, and saw The Love Stop, i have always wanted to go look in there, so we went. but there was a sign on the door sayin 19+ grrr.  i thought the legal age for that kinda stuff was 18.  instead we went to A&B Sound, that was neat, i had never been in there. (i dont get downtown much) after that we went to Tim Hortons and got some food, they burnt my sandwich!  Then i had to go home because Ashley was comming over to do more free massages. So I got home, chilled, and then i did somethign to my foot and it really frikken hurt, like a chunk of skin came out and it was burning and nooot cool, so i had to bandage it up, therfore i couldnt get a foot massage, but thats okay cuz Ashley was tired anyway. After that I jsut watched tv, and went to bed.  

I had planned to wake up early to go to Future Shop to get my cd, but my alarm didnt go off. grrr.  so i finally woke up, too late.  but i got on the bus anyway. Me and Ryan went to the computer store, then to the jewlery store (my bday/grad rings diamond was messed up) so we went and the lady was all bitchy sayin she couldnt fix it. The we went to Future Shop, man i HATE that place. My parents always say they go there and are swarmed by workers wanting to help em. but i went in there and no one would help me, man that pissed me off, and to make matters worse they didnt have the damn cd! i check the avalibility like 2 hrs befor online, yet supposedly they are sold out. so i went up to ask for the money from the gift card, because it was useless to me, and ""sorry we can only give store credit"" FUUUUVK!!  so i stormed out. then we went back to the computer store and i got the cable to hook my computer to the stereo, yay it works! thats the best thing about today. then i went to Tims and got a mocha, which she waaay over filled so i got coverd in whip cream. then went to coopers, then the pet store and for food, then home.  

thats my day so far."

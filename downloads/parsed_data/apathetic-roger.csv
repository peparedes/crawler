I truly hope that <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/exkeeperwood"">you</a> weren't expecting a thank you. You won't get one. Sorry.

Does anyone know what to do with a human heart? I haven't a fucking clue."

"event","It seems that something bad has happened. Well, I'm personally going to be out of touch for...well a while. It seems that I've been kidnapped for my own good. I hope that <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/exbeater"">you</a> do plan to let me go to practice as well. 

And just so I know, how long do you plan to keep me? I just hope you're not picking out a china pattern already..."

"event","Right, so I'm a bit late on starting this little project. I've been busy. Just in case any of my ""old school chums"" care, I'm playing Chaser for Puddlemere United. I live in London, and for once and for all, I am not involved in your fucking war. Get used to it. All of you. I'm not fighting for you, I'm not helping any of you. My life is mine and I'mnot going to let you destroy it or disrupt it."

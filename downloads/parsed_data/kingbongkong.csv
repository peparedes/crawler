"event","well.. its just another week in the year and my has gone by rather well. working 6 days a week isnt that bad.. it kinda sucks because id like 2 days off atleast but i gotta make the money..

i had fun this weekend too. hung out with some people i havent chilled with in forever. fucking laughed my ass off hardcore. i like laughing a lot. i dont know what it is but humor.. i just fucking love it. i think humor is a major part of my life. i know when to take things seriously but i also know when to laugh my ass off. friday night nate,ben,prep,joe,lindsey,harsh and myself had a great night. we were drinkin seagrams 7 and we had a vast amount of beer. i slept awesome that night. i woke up the next day and just relaxed. it was great to just kinda sit back and watch some tv. i havent done that in forever. im just tired when i get home from work and i do my ebay shit after i get off work at night. ive been doing awesome on ebay. im up to about 700 in sales this month! my life has just totally shifted in a different direction. a direction i had no idea existed. i actually enjoy my life now. theres no drama in it at all. i dont give a shit about anything. i just actually have a great time when i go out now.

so i met a girl recently.. i dont know where things are going. i dont know if i want a relationship. i enjoy being single and not worrying about bullshit. i know if i start a relationship then i will not be doing as much shit with my friends and i do not want that. i think my friends matter more to me than being tied down  24/7 to someone. dont get me wrong, id love to fall in love again, but not now , not here. shes a really sweet girl and has a great personality. i just dont want to commit. i dont know whats going to happen, but i'll eventually find out. it kinda excites me because in a way i dont want to lose someone who would be great to me but i also dont want to be tied down right now. im enjoying everything right now. ahh what the hell, might as well give it a try ,couldnt hurt.. atleast i dont think.

i just talked to jon a little while ago. it was good catching up and shit. he was telling me a lot of funny shit that has happened down there. i cant wait for him to come home in december. were def going to fucking party our asses off. im pumped now! all the boys back together in the same town.. uh oh..

well this weekend is going to be the shit! i cannot wait! i love halloween. its an excuse to have a good fucking time and not give a shit about it. well im gonna go now bc ive got some things to take care of..

chrissie, you drunk-dialed me at 3:56 am this morning you crazy ass! your message sounded really funny because i could defintely tell you were drunk.."

"event","well lets see... this is like the first update in forever. a lot of shit has changed since the last time i updated.. im starting to get used to work a lot more. it doesnt bother me that much anymore that i work everyday. it keeps me out of trouble.  i can only really party on friday nights because i dont work on saturdays. i started working at smokey bones again on sunday mornings. i started last weekend and got my first check yesterday. it was pretty good for one days work. its just cash on the side i can have fun with and save up... for the most part, everything is going well with working though. 

i miss my sister and her family. its been about 2 1/2 weeks since the last time i saw them. i cant wait to see them during christmas time. i miss my little fat niece and nephew.im so glad that i'll be able to get them awesome gifts for christmas since im working so much. i'll get them both something good this christmas.. alexia said she loves her new school. its fucking huge, looks like a high school but its just for elementary kids... the other fat, thats another story.. he just eats, sleeps and bugs. not much you can do with that, but he'll grow out of it...(hopefully.) reggie and leslie are both doing fine from what she tells me. im really happy for them because this is like a major step for them. they moved far away from where they used to live to start new lives.

anyways, i cant wait for halloween to come. i love halloween. were in the talks of throwing a big party. also a house show. andys band, my band and others will be playing that weekend. i cant wait, im about to go to fairhope and practice all day .weve been putting together some new material. im really considering getting a bigger set, thatd be the shit but itd also cost out the ass to do it so i might hold off.

other than what i wrote, things are getting way better in my life. it seems like all the bad shit has gone away it seems. i dont know, everything is better. im still on the hunt for a girl, but i might have found one already at work.. im not sure, im leaving my options open bc thats when you find the right one.. 

well i really dont have that much to say anymore. i always leave out a bunch of shit because i forget what i want to say all the time.. oh well, it'll come back to me eventually and maybe i'll post it. anyways, take care all."

this weekend was alright. i had a better time at my place on friday night after me and jones were at the pike house because i was actually with friends i havent hung out with in a while. jones, lindsey, nate, andy, kim and myself were chillin drinking, taking swigs of good ole Jack D. i didnt have a good time at all at the pike house. i was kinda pissed off honestly. i guess some people just love to be the same shit fuck they've been for a while. i guess things will never change and i think i can actually say that i just dont care anymore, at all.

last night i went to grand central and it was pretty fuckin packed out. there were a ton of people there. it was fun though. i had to get one last night of partying in before i start working. this week has been somewhat productive so im happy about that.

i had a fucking blast last night. i think its probably been the best night since like before the hurricane hit. went out with steven and the boys to ""atlantis."" i have not stepped foot in that place since i think like 2001 or 2002? i dont remember, but its defintely been a long time. anyways, we started out at Vin's drinkin. takin shots and just pre-drinking. it was cool. we got to the club and we didnt leave downtown til like 4 something. then we went to waffle house and that shit was fucking AWESOME. i got the MVP special. for some strange reason, i was being stupid and decided that id try waffles and tabasco sauce with syrup. not a good idea. i didnt eat it. i took like a few bites but then i was like fuck this shit. i got home and literally passed out when i got in my room. like when i woke up this morning the lights and tv were on, still had my clothes on. it was funny.

after getting up, i decided to go to my parents because theres food and a phone there. i watched the whole 9/11 thing special. it's really crazy that all that shit went down. it was very tragic and sad to see this all over again. it made me want to join the fucking army or something and just kill terrorists. they are fucking idiots. while being at the house, i grew curious as to what i have left behind in my old room. i looked in my closet and saw a bag full of tapes. guess what i fucking pulled out? fucking warren g and nate dogg single. ""regulate."" ive been listening to that tape non-stop. i forgot how badass old school rap was. its the shit. 

i enjoyed birmingham a lot. it was fun. id love to stay there a weekend or something and experience the night life. i really like where mckinnie lives. its an awesome neighborhood. he lives in mountain brook so its all fucking hills and curves. other than that, i loved it.

i need to start making molds because halloween is coming up and prices on ebay are starting to jump. so im going to defintely going to make some money hopefully if all goes well during this month and next month.it should be ""good times."" speaking of good times, i talked to laura yesterday and im talking to her right now. i miss that little chump. come back soon! we'll have ""good times."" i miss chrissie too. 

well ive said whats been on my mind so now its time to go start making shit. take care."

"event","so here i am once again updating. i know i kinda suck at it, but oh well. it's better than nothing right? anyways, what can i say? jon came in town for a week. steven is here for a while too. it was ""good times.""

last thursday jon got here and we decided to head to pat's. all you can drink for $7 is not bad at all. we had a good time down there. it was jon, steven, nate, andy, colma and i. we saw tacchi down there but he got kicked out 5 minutes later! haha. that night was fun. 

friday rolls along and we go to grand central. it was steven, stephanie, me, nate. we saw a good amount of people down there. ive never been there until last friday. i liked it a lot. so much that i went there the next night...

saturday comes and it's mckinnie, erika, jon and myself. mckinnie and i started out at his place. we took a shot of some rum and had a beer. we headed up to smokey bones bc i wanted some wings and of course we ordered pitchers of beer. jon arrived and the bartenders gave us each 1 shot of jager. then they gave us another shot which was called starry night. it was pretty good. it was jager and goldschlager. we went to matt's place after that so erika could get ready because we were goin to grand central again. so we go to grand central and have a blast. we all got pretty damn drunk. i had a really good time. except towards the end of the night where i got on jons phone and started drunk dialing. i called elizabeth up and fucking just went off. i dont remember what it was about but i know i was being out of control so she eventually hung up on me. i called her back and she didnt answer. i decided im much happier with her NOT in my life so i told her today that im ending all ropes i have with her. so i get really drunk saturday night. i get home and set my alarm for 7:45 am to go to work but the fucker never went off..

sunday comes and i open my eyes and my clock say 3:45 pm. i said, fuck. but then afterwards i didnt care. i lost my job sunday but im not worried about it.

monday came and the system of a down concert was that night. jon and i went to stevens to eat chinese. while being down there we decided we werent gonna go to the concert anymore so instead we all kinda hung out and did whatever monday night. i ended up giving the tickets to andy. him and chase went. they said it was awesome. oh well.

tuesday we all took it easy because we were gonna get pumped for wednesday night. 

wednesday arrives quickly and we start drinking over here. we go at like 10 to get our wristbands from hammerheads so we wouldnt have to wait in line forever to get in. afterwards, we came back to drink more. 11:30 rolls around so we go up there. its not that packed out like it usually is. i had a pretty good time there. i was drinking beer mostly. the drinks were getting too fruity. anyways, i got drunk and we all came back to the house. we drank a little more then eventually all split. 

jon went back home today. were going to pat's tonight again. i think it's going to be a repeat of last week. i dont know how much longer i can do this for because it adds up big time. i spent like $70 last saturday at grand central. that kinda sucks but i had a good time. 

this new job im getting.. it's gonna be kickass. im going to have my own desk, a/c kickin nonstop and last but not least... i'll be 1 of the 2 guys working there which means there will be lots of women. :) finally no sausagefest!!!! i'm going to be a bilingual customer service rep. from what my sister is telling me, idiots work up there. haha. she says it's easy as hell. easy money. and get this, if im on time all the time for a month, i get $600 bonus every month. im definitely not going to fuck this one up. guido's was a joke but this is for real. all my drinking and what not is going down the drain. if i drink, it's going to be on the weekends. i have to take this job seriously because i can make bank here. then hopefully move up in the company or something. i have to cut my hair and clean up. business attire. it sucks, but it pays. anyways, thats all really thats been going on with me in the past week. i can't wait to see what lies beyond this week. take care everyone."

elizabeth came in town monday. she stayed with me tuesday night. we hung out, drank and eventually got drunk. we stayed awake for a long time. longer than i anticipated. i think shes gonna stay one more night before she leaves. it was weird being around her, but at the same time, it was alright. carlyn will be back from the beach soon.. cant wait for that..

last night was pretty damn fun. it was wednesday so we headed up to hammerheads. steven arrived yesterday night. andy, steven and me headed up there and met up with nathaniel, ben and some other people. it wasnt as packed but i still had a good time. about 2 somethin we left to go meet up with jon. he got in town around the time we were leavin hammerheads. we all went to krystal to get some food, then got more beer and kept doin whatever. it was good times..

i went to hammerheads last night with joe, stephen, harsh and andy. i had a lot of fun.. there wasnt that big of a crowd like last time when i went. it actually took us about 3 minutes to get drinks because we know one of the chicks that works the bar. she was cool. we were all sober getting there and ended up leaving drunk. there were a ton of hot girls there. this one girl kept squeezing my ass but she didnt look good. haha. i would kinda just give her a puzzled look so she eventually got the hint. we hit up krystal after that and we literally laughed our asses off. i mean like we couldnt stop laughing. got home at about 4 or so then passed out. 

i woke up today at 11 because we had practice. that went well. we finished a song we have been writing for a while. i cant wait to order my new cymbals. its gonna fucking be awesome. i hope to be playing shows next month. 

i talked to jennifer today. i havent talked to her in a while and it was good to see shes back. laura and chrissie are leaving tomorrow so im definetely gonna hang with them tonight.

saw reynolds on saturday. that was cool. i havent seen matt in a really long time. it was fun drinkin and shit with him. sunday night, we all went over to rob's. it was tiffany, his wife's b-day. we all chilled in the back and grilled out. we drank a good bit. i ended up leaving about 1 or so because i had to be up kinda early this morning to take mckinnie to get a rental car.  this weekend was alright. no major highlights really. 

work was easy as hell today. tomorrow will suck. and the next day as well. carlyn's coming home on the 6th. 12 more days.. something else to look forward to. i cannot wait to see her. i miss her so much. it'll just be great to hang with her again. well im out of here. take care."

im watching that rwanda mess on the history channel. this shit is pretty fucked up... fucking people are ruthless. only think with power and nothing more. i used to be all about bush but he's a fuck nut too... i didnt know people were so savage as to fight over OIL. im sorry but i dont want to die over oil. id rather die of something else other than shedding blood over oil. instead of spending billions on bombs and shit... why dont you stop taking fucking money out of our checks for taxes. i think we'd all be ok with all the money  we TRULY earn. i just think i live in a world of shit. anyways, history channel and news makes me political. its an old subject but you can always have more and more to say..

anyways, sorry i had to sorta vent out. just sick of seeing the news everyday saying more casualties in iraq and what not...

i havent been doing much today... ive been in bed for a good while because my back is killing me. ive been doing weird stretches that i used to do in physical therapy. god id love to go back to electro-shock therapy. that was the shit. felt so good and when the nurse would leave the room id turn that fucker up way higher. :) i hope to God i dont have to go back to that. that was miserable. the pain that is... if i have to have surgery again, im going to fucking flip. i was out for more than 3 months. i was in bed and doing BULLSHIT for 3 months straight. hopefully i can get this fixed without surgery. 

i was at nathaniels on saturday and we were drinkin. it was a good time. i had a lot of fun. rachel called me that night and i was totally blown away because i have not talked to her in over a year. i was so exstatic to speak with her. we almost had something going. i was defintely interested in dating her a year ago. it just shocked the shit out of me she called me. i wanted to see her so bad that night but i didnt think it was such a wise idea so i didnt... maybe it was the right choice? i dont know. i want to say i think she will be coming back friday. i told her to come out that night. it'll be nice to see her but sad to see her go...

in other news, i got new heads for all my shells. they sound great. big difference totally.. next thing i need to do is get new cymbals and with my b-day coming up, maybe mother and father will be generous :D. im excited. i hope this wont affect my back that much. i remember i used to have to cycle a lot to help release pressure on my back. i will kill myself if i cant play anymore. well im through yappin away. i think im gonna go look for a movie or something because i'll be here all day bored as shit doing nothing. i dont know what im going to do about work because i dont need to be lifting heavy shit and i have to fuckin lift shit all day long at work. we'll see what happens..

monday- relaxed because i was off of work due to a pussy hurricane. hey im not bitching, atleast i got off that day!

tuesday- worked a double. went home, got a shower and went to paddy's. i met prep,caroline,harsh and sumeet there. we had some beers then went back to my house. i got pretty fucked up that night.

wednesday- worked my morning shift and was pretty damn excited to get off work. that night, mckinnie, erika, harsh, sumeet and i went to el giro. we had some margaritas then took the party to mckinnies where we drank some more beer. after that, we went to hammerheads. it was fun as shit. i got pretty fucked up and i dont remember getting home. that place just seems to get better and better.i love when a group of us just goes up there. we always get hammered there for cheap as hell... not to mention all the hot girls you see. that night was really fun except the next day....

thursday- hungover as shit. havent felt this shitty in a LONG time. i had to record that day at 8 am. my singer showed up at my house at 7:30 am and he called me 7 times. i finally woke up and looked at the clock and it said 8:24. i felt so bad because he was calling me nonstop and was waiting outside for nearly an hour. woops! haha, its all good. we recorded that day and hopefully i'll be getting a copy of that demo so i can start putting lyrics in the songs. i didnt really do all that much that day because i felt like shit. claire came over while andys band was playing so we sat outside and had some beers, talked.. laura came over after that, then steven came over. we had a few beers over here then went to phi and perin's. we drank over there for a while. carlyn called me and i was literally gone for an hour talking to her. i had to redeem myself for being bad 2 weeks ago. everythings all good now. i cannot wait for her to get here in august. its going to be the best month out of the year. shes the best...she really is. i had about 6 beers that night so i felt good going to work the next day..

friday- work my morning shift and come home to take a nap. i get up about 8 pm ready to go out and do shit.  steven came in town and we went to phi and perin's again. then laura came over there and we chilled, drank, then came back to the house for a little more drinking. i passed out at about close to 4 am.

today- i am awake now, but i dont want to be. this sucks,i cant sleep for shit. oh well. thats basically a sum up of the week. nothing that great has happened. im loving this rain though. i cant wait to go eat at stevens today. that food is gonna be the shit. after that, im coming back to play some with the band. hopefully write some new shit.

my life seems like it's getting a little better. hopefully.. take care everyone"

"event","well im sitting here on the net waiting for that damn storm to get here. it seems this has been the longest weekend because of all the anticipation for this storm. my parents keep buggin the shit out of me to come to their house so i cant argue with that really.. food and drinks over there. i dont have shit over here. i guess i dont really care about preparing for this storm. i spray painted ""hola nina"" on the front of the house where the boards are. i thought it was pretty funny because i was a little intoxicated and bored. 


my weekend was fun. friday night was defintely a night to remember. good times. 

yesterday was alright as well. 

today is going to suck because i am going to be bored as shit out of my mind at my parents. not to mention, i probably wont be working for a week due to the storm. shitty paycheck man..

take care, im out people."

"event","wow, well i have not updated in forever. i just got up a few minutes ago and i am pretty stoked about playing with the band today. finally everyone will be here. we can actually do some shit now, maybe even record today. i hope this shit goes well because i am ready to start playing shows. all this practice has to pay off for something..

   i didnt do shit last night. andy, chase, sharina, courtney and i sat around and watched rescue me and 30 days. we were drinkin and tokin, i think thats why we just got glued to the television. some pretty good shit comes on FX. one of my favorite channels. i dont know whats going on tonight but i have to fucking work tomorrow at goddamn 8:30. i know it will be slow as fuck. tomorrow will be the biggest waste of time. my job pisses me off so much. this will be like the 3rd holiday ive worked now and ive been there for over 3 months now. i think im going to ask for a raise. im so ready to get out of the restaraunt business. 

   i cannot wait to finish school. a part of me is ready to grow up and the other half wants to remain the big kid i am. it's going to be a tough decision but i know what i truly want.. life has not been too great here. it seems like everyone  is going in their own direction of what they want to do. it's rare for everyone to get together and have a good time without the drama. 

   on other notes, carlyn came and visited me last sunday night. it made me so incredibly happy. i think the happiest i have been all summer. her flight was changed to the next day so she came over and we watched tv, talked, etc. all the feelings come back to me when she's next to me, when i talk to her, when i see her. when i hold her, i just dont want to even let go. it sucks shes so far  away, but we'll see what happens in the future. i mean i will defintely wait for her, but in the meantime, we'll see what happens. i hate being so lonely all the time. i havent dated anyone in an extravagant amount of time, im talkin like almost close to 2 years.. it sucks not having anyone there when you want them to be.

   in other news, yesterday, colma, andy and i went to a graveyard that had a huge ditch, tall grass and an open field. we had 5 foot poles and went scurrying along the field. doing what? slaying every snake that came our way. it was pretty fun but sucked for the snakes. hey, id rather be safe than sorry. i dont want some stupid snake biting me. but i will tell you, they are some sneaky slick bastardos. we manages to come out alive with 4 in our name. haha. sound like fuckin steve irwin. 

  to sum it up... work, being stupid, work, missing someone so much.

  take care everyone"

"event","ok so i havent updated in nearly a month and a lot has happened over that time. a lot..

ive been working steadily and getting myself back into the whole working thing. things have gone well i guess. work sucks, but fuck, it buys me shit. i get fucked up and wake up late for work. thats not good. oh well, life goes on. 

jons in town right now. he came for a week. i havent seen him since christmas. weve been doing shit every night just like the old days. its good to have him back. stevens in town, theresa came in town. lara even came over the other night. it was like the crew, or atleast half of it reunited. im really happy to see them all. 

someone else showed up in town as well... my ex carlyn..
i went out with her 2 nights this week and they were the damn best nights ive had in over a year. she left for notre dame again today. ive been incredibly sad. i cannot stop thinking about her. it sucks because i remember exactly why i dated her to begin with. i remember why i fell in love with her. within 2 nights, i experienced what i did almost 1 year and a half ago. if i could reverse time, i would damn well do it. i think carlyn was the best for me. she has a great thing going for her. she doesnt tolerate drama nor does she bring it to the table. i had the best time ever with her. all the memories came back and i absolutely cherished every minute i was spending with her. shes done exactly what ive ever wanted a girl to do. make me happy 24/7. no matter what, i dont think i could ever get sick of her. there are some people you can only take for a certain amount of time, but carlyn, man.. never would i get sick of her. i know i keep ramblin on, but im getting it all out now so i can try to sleep. i know i will be thinking about her as i try to fall asleep. damn she really does mean a lot to me. jon and i were talking tonight about the whole ordeal with her and myself. he told me he could see us getting back together. i think that would make me the happiest person if that happened. when he said that, it brought a smile to my face because i have something to look forward to now...if it's meant to be that is. all i can do now is hope. not pray. i think praying would be a little extreme and when i think of prayer it reverts to religion and God. i dont think it should be used in a manner of wishing for something. she kept telling me she missed me. i quickly returned her message. i got so drunk at hammerheads i had to get carlyn to drive us back home. we came back here and layed together talking about the old days. man, im so fucking lonely its ridiculous. seeing her was almost like a tease. i got to see her and have great fun with her but then she leaves. theres nothing i can do. i never stopped caring and she knows that now...

now that i kinda got that out i'll go on with some more stories. 

( im still thinking about her!!!!!)

well the boys and i have been getting pretty fucked up the past few nights. i had a fucking blast at hammerheads last night. i havent had that much fun in forever. i think i actually danced? i was hammered as shit. we kept taking shots of jager and doing jager bombs. quarter well drinks. good times i guess. i had a lot of fun. i saw everyone. all of us back together getting fucked up. very fun. 


i just keep dazing off thinking about shit. im trying to remember what all i can write down..

erins leaving for the air force soon. its gonan be sad. she was like a person i couldnt get pissed at. i dont think erin and i ever had any kind of conflicts..i will miss her a lot. although we were supposed to hang out one night and that didnt happen.

i think ive come to a conclusion that i just dont give a fuck anymore about life itself. it's defintely ""over-rated."" to all those ""happy"" people, it must be damn good to smile about something everyday.

goodnight"

"event","so the weekend starts on friday april 22. i went to work at 830 that day. i was so happy that it was friday because that means im off from one job on the weekend. i worked guidos then hopped over to the water street cafe and worked that night. it actually picked up and had like about 50-60 people in it. the most ive ever seen. i dont know how much longer thats going to last. i might work somewhere else. i dont know? but itd be cool to have like 3 jobs. anyways, that night people came over and we drank, played cards,etc. 

saturday came and i jammed out with my guitarist. things are starting to go smoothly. we recorded our first track about 3 weeks ago. it sounded pretty good, all we need is a bassist and singer. fuck it, im not worried about it really. jennifer p, colma, kimberly, amy and myself  drank at my house for a little while that night then went to all sports-a bar. we stayed there for about 30 minutes then went downtown to bbobs. i didnt have that much fun there so we left and got some beer before the 2 am shit. colma, jenn and me came back here and watched identity, then BLOODSPORT. ive watched bloodsport like 3 days in a row now. i dont know if i can get sick of it or not. 

i started talkin to my friend helena again. i havent talked to her in forever and now that we got a hold of each other, its like were constantly talking. i went to go see her up at work last night. it was cool to see her again. shes weird like me, but like only when we are alone. she wont act like an idiot in front of other people. shes an idiot. haha. 

oh shit! i also found a girl that i talked to at spring break like 4 years ago. shes a cute blonde. who knows? maybe something will come from this. i havent dated in like over a year. it fucking blows. im so damn lonely all the time. dear God, work your ""magic"" and we'll see what happens...

take care everyone. i love you all even if i dont show it at times.

"event","i havent updated in a while. but here goes..

well i finally started working again, not only 1 but 2 jobs! i cant wait for the income. i really need to pay off a lot of things. i started working at guido's with KK. this was my second week. the people there are really cool/laid back. you basically do what you want up there, but of course you have to be doing work at the same time.. it's going good so far. im getting the hours i want and getting off when i want. i couldnt ask for more right now. my uncles thing is going way too slow. but i'll give it like 2-3 weeks before it really starts picking up. enough talk about work.

i wish things werent the way they are now. we(my friends) all used to get along great. i dont like the hatred/anguish towards one another. it was never like this back in the day, it was always, ""you need another beer?"" now it's like, ""im gonna kill you"" (literally). i dont know where we all went wrong, but i wish everything could mend itself together and we could all do the same shit we did back in the day. it feels like sometimes i have to choose sides and i dont like that. it shouldnt have to be that way but shit happens and i all i can do is sit and watch. it really upsets me to see all this shit going on. maybe everything will be ok in the end..


as for my life, its the same boring life. nothing new except work. i wish i could meet someone because it seems like everyone has a boyfriend or girlfriend. thats what i need. i need someone that i can get to know and grow together with. someone i can just hang out with and like do whatever with. an accomplice of some sort. anyways, take care. i think i may go the beach, its nice outside. peace.

"event","ok, havent been on this site for a while now. so heres somewhat of an update. well lets start with last saturday night. that was the best night. i called and talked to the girl from tk101 and told her i needed tickets for slipknot. she asked why, yadda yadda. i told her a friend didnt come through with tickets when he said he did. we made a deal and she asked me ""slipknot trivia."" little did she know... i won the tickets and was ecstatic as fuck. me and prep went sunday night to pensacola. we thought we had floor tickets bc we were VIP and shit. but nope, upper level. so we sat in the balcony area on the side. watched shadows fall play, they were pretty badass. the lead singer has dreads going past his ass and they are in like huge locks. after they played we went to the meet and greet. there were only 3 chairs and i was thinking, fuck only get to meet 3. thats exactly what it was. sid,craig and corey came out. everyone was being quiet and i yelled out in a redneck voice, ""yeah! its fuckin slipknot man!"" that kinda broke the room loose and everyone started kinda just talking after that. they were all cool. finally getting to meet and get something signed by my favorite band was probably the best thing to happen this year. im trying to talk colma into going to the new orleans show because i missed lamb of god because of the meet and greet. the whole show was just fucking badass in general. slipknot played for 2 hours. it was great. would have been better if i was on the floor moshing. oh well, atleast i got VIP and got to go in general. im very thankful for that. i know Someone up there was wanting me to win those tickets.. im convinced.. good night none the less.

finally getting things rolling at my uncles. i finished the big ass logo on the 30 foot wall. im happy with the outcome. i was fucking scared as hell to get that high to paint on a wall. but i sucked it up. i told my dad to come to the place. he held the ladder for me and told me that what i was doing was nothing compared to what he does at work. he told me he has to go up 150 ft. and check gauges at his chemical plant. that scared the fuck out of me when he told me that. it makes me respect him even more because i know i wouldnt have the balls to do that shit everyday. just to know he busts his ass 150 feet in the air makes me want to punch myself in the face everyday. i dont like the idea of my dad being that high everyday. i hate myself when im a complete dickhead to my parents sometimes. i dont think im a dick at first until i realize afterwards. they have done so much for me and i just treat them like shit sometimes.    i guess i will know how lucky i was to have them when they are gone, but hopefully that doesnt happen. i love my parents. i dont know why im getting so deep right now. i think its because its been on my mind for quite some time now. just getting it off my chest. i think i just have this fear of someone dying in my family and it freaks me out big time. 

it's time for me to stop writing, i'll go on forever if i dont stop now. so there you go, an update for you.

im getting pretty hungry so i think im gonna go get some shrimp fried rice bc its friday and im not supposed to eat meat on fridays. its the least i can do bc i know i sin all the time. maybe God will go easy on me. BABY OIL WRESTLING TONIGHT! hopefully it'll be good...! good evening america.

i played slots all night. brian kept talking me into gambling more and more and so i did. left with the same fucking amount i came to the place with. oh well. it was fun up until we had to wait on pinkus and michael because they were playing poker. we walked around and drank a lot of coffee. we found some dudes casino card, but we didnt know his pin so we couldnt do shit with it.

overall my experience was fun at the casino. i know next time i will go prepared BIG time. saw a few milf's. thats always good. this is my first journal, im off to bed. good night america.

"event","My sister's on my case about how it's ""self destructive"" to hang out with friends who like to cuddle and all that jazz. She thinks I'm going to be led into the ""orgy lifestyle,"" and that I'm going to be sexually promiscuous because I was leaning on Lawrence during a movie.

She's furious with me for disagreeing and says I'm immature for not seeing it. She's ""older and wiser,"" she tells me. She may be older and know more about life, but she knows jack all about spirituality.

She's bitter and she criticizes everybody. I mean she's such a closed-minded individual...I mean I am happy she told me how she felt, but did she have to attack me? No, she did not."

"event","from the time your eyes looked into mine
my face was frozen still in time
every day you gaze at me
you fill me with your ecstasy
as you work me to the core
i tug your hair and beg for more
addicted to your touch i sigh
as your hand moves up my thigh
i need you here, i need you now
you've opened up my rock somehow
your jaws of life are ectsasy
through my jeans they climb my tree
slowly with your teeth you pull
as metal passes metal full
your tongue it drives me wild so loose
my legs they spread so fine obtuse
as you lead me into fire
i tense up quick, this wild desire
with that i make my final moan
the tension drops, loose to the bone"

gasping for air, my eyes they start gleaming
biting my lip, to keep from screaming
hypnotized by flesh, an intense desire
a spinning world of magic, passion and fire
a raging bull released from beneath my clothes
a flame from my eyes, to the tips of my toes
licking my lips, my body starts to shiver
thrusting my hips, my pelvis starts to quiver
i feel so intense, cannot hold back anymore
i squeeze my eyes tight, as i'm stretched across the floor
a moan escapes my mouth, like a bell loudly rung
spread through my teeth, to the tip of my tongue
words cannot explain...the pleasure's too great
my body undressed, like a work of fate
moans scattered 'round, from below to above
i tilt my head and rock my bed, i want your liquid love
i need to keep on going, just got to blow my top
just looking at your sultry face, i never want to stop
digging into flesh, my fingers do the walking
i let the prize between my thighs do all the dirty talking
my body starts to tremble, sweat dripping from my chest
every moan and grunt from you, it puts me to the test
pull back the tinted lever
remove the leather glove
i lick my lips and thrust my hips
release your liquid love

"event","<font size=""-3"">I really want to read the book <b>Jane Eyre</b>.



I am certain that it would be quite intellectually stimulating.



So anyway I hung out with <font class=""caption""><b>Geoff</b></font> and later,



I will be going to Detour with <font class=""caption""><b>Miranda</b></font> with



the skimpy shirt she lent me money to buy.



When I get home after seeing &ldquo;<font class=""caption""><b>Zazu</b></font>,&rdquo; I will



study Linguistics for a bit, and then perhaps panic over Calculus and



go over the text book items.



And I cannot wait for <font class=""caption""><b>Madonna&rsquo;s</b></font> next album.  



It will be produced by <font class=""caption""><b>Stuart Price</b></font> (Zootwoman, X-Static Process) and



<font class=""caption""><b>Mirwais</b></font> (Music, American Life)



She has also reportedly gotten the <font class=""caption""><b>London Community Gospel Choir</b></font> (Nothing Fails)



and <font class=""caption""><b>Bloodshy</b></font> (Toxic, AM to PM) to produce her next record.



She is apparently throwing a lot of balls up in the air.  Along with Bloodshy's reported



dance-thumper and the choir and electronic sounds, the album will have a slight



trip-hop and rocked-up feel to it.  A latin track will also be included, according to



reports.  It seems like her album, much like Bedtime Stories, will be a mix



of many different sounds, like electronica, rock, trip hop, gospel, disco, latin and hip hop.



The current title is Project 05, as a working title.



I simply cannot wait for this!

<b>TWITCH</b>

you make it throb, you make it twitch
satisfy this hungry itch
a raging bull, trapped deep inside
to a place i cannot hide
never haunted, never been kissed
but with you i can't resist
cannot stop, this built-up purge
no self control, the luscious urge
i need your lips, pressed against mine
with your hands on my behind
pulsating strong, in bondage tight
throbbing hard, with all its might
you make it stiff, you make it itch
it growls hungry, a little twitch
do not stop, i know it's right
carry on through all the night

Oh yes, and Daniel, I love you! I'm sorry I fell asleep when you tried to call :(

i am trapped here now
how will i escape?
i'm falling like bricks
my head is splitting
my heart is slipping
don't know which one to follow
and which one to ignore
can't follow my heart into a vastly harsh doom
i'm in a cage with a fork in the road
the hard metal banging against my forehead
cannot eat, cannot sleep
cannot laugh, cry, or speak
fine lines between anger and hate
i'm shaken, i'm lost
i need to find my tree
my head is spinning out of control
in total confusion, like my heart
proceeding so cautiously
not knowing what to do
i'm tainted
i'm no longer virginal white
now ripped into colors of darkness aloof
i lower my head and pray for mercy

<font class=""caption""><b>Hearts that Bleed</b></font>
Hearts that bleed
Eyes that rain
A rock hard place,
Isolated in the desert of ice
I don a black cape
I move in for the kill,
The rock hard place entombed in my mind
I jump the cliff,
My wings that soar,
Gently gliding in the sacred sky

<font class=""caption""><b>The Beautiful Stranger</b></font>
He's standing there,
So unaware that he is being watched
Just walking now, gracefully down the hallway

Part of me hopes that he is aware of my watchful gaze,
Another part, however, is horrified
As I sit, I vow to one day meet this young gentleman
With whom I shared a city bus with every Monday and Wednesday
For about six months

I can't say yet if I will bed this beautiful stranger
But I must admit I do long for his boyish eyes
To look back at mine
To stare back deeply, if not for a moment, for an eternity
Only not from a distance as I do unto him
But up close, where each and every breath can be felt
On the surface of our cheeks

Or breathing down my neck
As my body turns away from his
His hands slowly but softly roaming my torso and stomach
As he explores, he gets lower and lower
As his fingers dip below my belt
And I close my eyes, lift my head and exhale

Where will this go?
I cannot say,
I'll leave it up to fate

<font class=""caption""><b>The Lone Eye</b></font>
Here I sit on this soft felt chair
My eyes fixated on the cold ice screen
The light staring right back at me
With no hint of acknowledgement of my existance
Waiting...I sit
Waiting...I breathe
I call out a name, but alas...nobody is there to hear me
Second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour
My eyes burning into the depths of the endless screen
Burning deeper, where there is no end
No fear, no dream
No sign of life for light years ahead
Staring endlessly through the night
Frozen and locked through time and space

<b>Today with Angela:</b>

Lending Money to Jamie $3.00 (to be paid back)
Buying Timbits for Wendy&rsquo;s $2.50
Special Items $13.00
Edo of Japan $8.00
Coffee and Cookie $6.00

Food from Vending Machinese: $3.00
Additional Change: $2.00

<b>Total Spent:</b> $49.74

Sounds about right...oh dear!

Ok, here is my strategy. I have $77.00 all together at this moment, including all my past money.  My mother owes me fifteen bucks for the rest of the week for lunch money. I will not buy anything to eat at school (bringing food instead).  So I will have $92.00

<b>The money I shall have: $92.00</b>

EXPENSES:

$48.14 - New Cell Phone
$25.00 - Phone Bill

TOTAL EXPENSES: $73.14

LEFTOVER: $18.86

<b>Future Expenses:</b>

Tycoon Tommorrow: $8.00 + $5.00 = $13.00 (I will play very little there)

Leftover: $5.86 - <b>WILL BE USED FOR FRIDAY DDR</b>

And for additional money? I will just work for Mother as much as I can to get money.

Man, I need a new job!

PLUS I'll have three additional dollars IF Jamie pays me back! ^O^!

POSSIBLE WAYS OF EARNING MONEY FROM MOTHER:

 - <b>CHINESE NEW YEAR!</b>
 - Polishing the staircase
 - Cleaning up the basement
 - Vacuuming the House
 - Watering the Plants
 - Giving the Kitchen a Cleaning

I don&rsquo;t know.  I guess I am just a bit hurt by recent events, but the only person I really can blame it on is myself.  Maybe I hurt too easily.  I dunno...I don&rsquo;t know what to think because I get upset way too damn much for the stupidest reasons.  Maybe this is why I&rsquo;m not popular.  Not that I&rsquo;d ever want to be, anyway.

People I guess think that...I think before I speak, and the truth is, I don&rsquo;t.  Maybe I&rsquo;m just too sensitive and I need to be a bit tougher, the way I like to think I used to be at one point.

I guess too much is changing at a rapid pace, but really I don&rsquo;t know sometimes you know?  It&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;m not as innocent as I&rsquo;d like to think I am, but I&rsquo;m not a monster either.

an evening sky
peppered with specks of glistening light
woven through an unreachable dark blanket
by the bruised and calloused fingers of an elderly woman,
dressed in blacks and dark grays.
she sighs heavily as the night air pushes through the grass, trees and
cold, trickling streams
there is nothing but fury and pain in her eyes
empty of tears that will one day return
from the depths of the seas and the deep, deep oceans.
she is a vengeful soul,
without a merciful strand on her treacherous head
of long flowing hair
the untamed water is her dear friend,
responding to her every whim and desire
rising venomously high with an intent to kill,
she cackles dryly
revelling in her revenge.
the elderly woman has had the last laugh

If I'm having a bad day, it's not like I treat everyone else terribly. I may vent but that's it.  I CHALLENGE any ONE of you to remind me of a time I personally attacked you due to my mood, without being provoked.  

Yes, like any human being I may WANT to just strangle someone, anyone, while in a bad mood, but I usually keep it in me, 90% of the time, because I know that in my right mind I would never treat that one person badly.  

Well I'm done.  I don't take that kind of bullshit from <b>anyone</b>.  Ima start usin' the blocker, because I don't deserve this.  Life is about the world, past, present, future, and people as a whole.  Life isn't just about you.  Every thing we do affects others, and it's about time we fucking LEARN that it's NOT GOOD to treat someone like a third class citizen for no good reason other than ""I had a bad day.  So fucking deal with it.""

i've crossed the line, there's no turning back

the cloth has been cut, the door is unlocked
a great pulling force of those whom are mocked
insatiable desire, an effortless plane
a selfish endeavor stepping onto the train
freedom awaits, like the wine-stained sky
entrapment contained, i may finally fly
but this is a risk of a broken wing
to give me my story, and a song to sing
i struggle to find my navigational map
with this i shall fall, a treacherous trap

There are so many anti-Theresa lists of crimes out there, I figured that it was about time to make one for Gwen. What do you think? Not that Theresa is innocent. But they give Gwen too much credit! I've done it before, but I think this is more thourough...

Ok, well this isn't a list of ""crimes,"" but it shows Gwen's true character.


Constantly pressuring Ethan into proposing when she knew that he needed time to adjust to Harmony.


Having a hissy fit every time she saw Ethan and Theresa together, even if it was misconstrued. If the situation were reversed, Theresa would have run out crying. Gwen would have attacked them and murdered them. Funny.


Interrogated Theresa about her alleged ""boyfriend"" at Theresa's father's funeral!


Glared at Theresa at midnight when Theresa's ""father"" died falling through the skylight just because she ran into Ethan's arms. So Ethan's arms are more important than a father. I see. 


Fussing because she thinks someone has a ""crush"" on Ethan. Whether or not she was right, or whether or not Theresa was scheming, that is definite insecurity.


Threatening to leave Ethan because he couldn't give her an engagement ring (then Theresa took it off and let Ethan propose to Gwen). People say Theresa tried to sell Ethan out to a tabloid and that she purposely kept the ring. TRUE about the ring, but at least minute she decided to do what was right. Same with the tabloid thing. 


Told Ethan that he could keep Theresa as his mistress so long as Gwen can become ""Mrs. Ethan Crane"" (I only heard that from several sites...I didn't see that episode and I don't even know if it is true)


Tried to seduce Ethan after he called off the wedding, by following her mother's plan of using sexy lingere. And when she used the glass of water to feign phony tears? I don't think Rebecca had anything to do with that.


Even though she didn't want Theresa to walk in on them, Gwen used the moment to gloat to Theresa that she was in bed with Ethan.


Attacked Theresa (or at least tried to) with a baseball bat and tried to strangle her. (And ""Payback's a Bitch"" isn't a good excuse in my opinion...Adults, especially ones of high society with reputations, should consider that they are held responsible for their actions)


Locked Pilar in a closet in an attempt to murder her daughter.


Eavesdropped on Tabitha so that she could accuse Theresa of being a witch (the tealeave thing)


Schemed with her mother to sabatoge Ethan and Theresa's only real date.


Lying about how she doesn't care about the Crane money.


When Theresa gave back the engagement ring and ran off, Gwen manipulated Ethan into thinking Theresa was a golddigger. She made him think that Theresa left Ethan because she couldn't have the diamond ring anymore. He believed it. Ethan believed Theresa didn't love him anymore because he was no longer a Crane. She showed up. With her life savings. For Ethan. Ethan realized that Theresa didn't run out of the mansion because she didn't keep the ring. But so that she could give her life savings to help Ethan get back on her feet. Something Gwen wouldn't have done in those days.


Gloating about how she would ""rule society"" when she had ""more power than Ivy"" as Mrs. Ethan Crane (before she learned of Theresa's betrayel...she wasn't sweet turned evil. She was selfish through and through. Her and Theresa should be a couple. They would work.)


Gloated whenever possible. Still does. Not as much. Weird.


She got her and Ethan's friends Robert and Sharon to sneak in conversation of Gwen and Ethan's memories so that Ethan would forget about Theresa (does this count??)


Used her ""best friend's"" death as a tool to get close to a grieving Ethan.


Used this death to manipulate Ethan into thinking that Theresa didn't give a hoot about him (just after saying that Theresa was obsessed with him. weird)


Destroyed a gift Theresa gave to Ethan...a very significant teddy bear.


Gwen's racist. She called Theresa ""Teresita"" in a mocking manner. She made a stupid ""sombrero"" joke in the Bermuda elevator. She yelled ""mija"" when she raised the bat over Theresa's head. With her mother, (not lately though...) calls Theresa a Chalupa. But she never called Theresa a taco queen. Why would she say Chalup..never mind!!!


Later used it to frame Ethan for hating Theresa by telling her that Ethan ripped it up and threw it in the trash (or down the stairs)


Vowed to her mother to do anything in her power to falsley make Theresa look as bad as possible in front of Ethan.


Schemed with Mommy Dear to expose Ethan's relationship with Theresa to Luis.


Helped distract Ivy so that her mother could get the proof she needed to destroy Ethan.


Tricked Ethan into kissing her (with a ""last goodbye kiss"") Ay! That sounds like something Psycho Theresa would do!


Plotted and schemed with her mother to destroy lives by sending an e-mail containing a shocking secret to a tabloid. Traitors. Don't say that they didn't want to destroy lives. Gwen specifically say ""I will destroy Theresa."" And Rebecca specifically said ""We will bring down the house of Crane"" and Gwen smiled with a snicker.


Lied to Ethan and Theresa about being over Ethan.


Plotting with her mother to become Mrs. Ethan Crane by having him adopted. (For the same reasons as Theresa...Gwen wanted to give Ethan back his life so that it wouldn't be in shambles, and become a Crane. Wow)


Planning an engagement party (much like Theresa planning a wedding) for the sole purpose of using it to destroy her rival.


Lied to Theresa, telling her that now that Ethan isn't a Crane, he will never love her again.


Used a voice distorter on more than one occasion to tip the tabloid off with the false information about Theresa being the one who sold Ethan out (when it was her and her wench of a mother). Rebecca even had to cut the cord (pull it out of the wall actually) because Gwen was going too far and Rebecca said she needed to be patient.


Helped her mother send a copy of the tabloid to Ivy's room.


Delayed the wedding as much as possible by yelling out when Father Lonigan said ""If anyone shall object..."" Okay, that's not a crime lol. Never mind! Okay, then I will say something else...um...yes. Stalked Theresa with her mother by following Ethan and Theresa to Bermuda (what business did Gwen have with Ethan to follow him to Bermuda??)


Lied to Ethan, saying she was sorry. Okay, maybe she did feel bad about what she did, but she turned right around to gloat, right after saying that she ""realizes"" that Theresa isn't a ""bad person"" just someone who makes ""mistakes."" Ha! Gag me.


Clinging to Ethan the second he breaks up with Theresa so that she is there to pick up the pieces.


After all Theresa's been through (hell and back literally, getting the man she wanted and then losing him after waking up married to his ex-father and pregnant with the baby, ""executed,"" thrown herself down an elevator shaft, was accused of something Rebecca [and Gwen] did), Gwen hasn't been through all that. She is too independant (now anyways), and yet when Ethan chose Gwen because of her baby, Gwen gloated like crazy!


Reprimanded her mother for manipulating Luis and Sheridan when she was doing the exact same thing with Ethan and Theresa.


Lied to Theresa, claiming she never lied to get Ethan's love. Ha!


Lied again, saying that when Ethan and Theresa were together, she stepped back and let them have their happiness.


Speaking ill of the dead when Ethan says he is sad about Theresa's alleged death, and Gwen said that Theresa was a bitch who didn't deserve anybody crying over her death.


Being furious that Theresa had ""come back to life.""


Let's not forget how rude Gwen is and arrogant. ""Housekeeper's daughter."" And holy camole, burn! She totally burned Hank when he asked her out.


Walked out on Father Lonigan after he said what she was planning to do was evil.

Scoffed when an angel warned her that her evil deeds would bring evil to Harmony. 


Adding to the pressure at the double wedding by constantly adding snide remarks about how Theresa did this and that. On her wedding day. Not the night before. The day of.


Plotting to destroy the wedding of her best friend! (Not for that purpose, but that's beside the point). Oh yeah, that is actually good because she saved Sheridan's life. Go figure.


Tried to drug Theresa's tea. (Ha! And Theresa switched cups. LMFAO)


Uses her baby every time she can to make Ethan focus on her. (I can't say that I blame her for that one though)


Reprimands Theresa's scheming face when she is just as bad if not worse


Being compassionate for the sake of looking good in front of Ethan (Not too sure 'bout that one)


Again, gloating that ""the end of Theresa"" is coming.


Plotting to become Mrs. Crane by insisting Ethan and her stay in the mansion (which they have no right to live because Gwen's mother is Julian's puta.)


When Theresa was going to make love to Ethan, Gwen broke into the Lopez-Fitzgerald home (again) and started to interrogate Theresa. When Theresa was naked. In bed. I think.


Talk about classy. Moaning extra loud in bed as a means of gloating. (it's true. Oh Ethan! with her snicker and her pupils looking to Theresa's door. And the hickey? That was so dumb.


Lying about Ivy, saying Ivy would never manipulate, when clearly she knows Ivy's manipulative nature. She just wants Theresa to look bad in insulting Ethan's mother.


Constantly breaking (or trying to break) commandments. Stealing. Attempted murder (actually with murderous intent!). Parental dishonour. 


Attacking Theresa at the hospital, then trying to make it look like Theresa wanted to stress her out as a means to murder her baby.


Ignoring the doctor's wishes, not caring that her baby could die, so she could go play hanky panky with Ethan at the Crane apartment.


Once again ignoring doctor's ORDERS by choosing to choke Theresa over the life of her own baby.


Blaming Theresa for losing her baby, when she is to blame as well.


Schemed with her mother to get revenge on Theresa and make her lose her son.


Schemed with her mother to make Theresa's entire family lose their jobs.


Schemed with her mother to make the Lopez-Fitzgeralds homeless.


Had the Lopez-Fitzgeralds evicted from their home so that they could take Little Ethan.


Had the Lopez-Fitzgeralds blacklisted all over town.


Tried to force Theresa to murder the implanted baby.


Strangled Theresa in court.


Threw Theresa out of a window.


Attacked Theresa with a bedpan.


Stabbed Theresa with a scalpel, leaving her paralyzed.


Trying to choke Sheridan to death.


Attacking her mother.


Slitting her wrists in a murderous plot.


Chasing Theresa around the hospital with a pair of scissors.


Kidnapping Theresa's baby.



I'm sure there's more. I just can't think of them right now. And it's NOT like Terrorcita sites where they repeat the same one again and again to make the number of misdeeds larger. Like this: Theresa disrespects her mother. Another one will say ""Theresa disobeyes Luis and her mother."" Then one will say ""Theresa acted against her family."" Then one will say ""She broke the ten commandments."" Then one will say ""She tried to kill, steal, covet, all wrong according to the Bible."" The one will say ""She made love to Ethan against Pilar's wishes."" Then one will say ""She made love to Ethan before their wedding."" Then one will say ""She disobeyed her brother's wishes for her about premarital sex."" Come on!

I think she's psycho. Would a sane person (no matter what) go to someone's house with a baseball bat, lock a middle-aged woman in a closet with murderous intentions, stab mannequins (however u spell it), and frame people for ridiculous things???

it's a hasty conclusion
all those pictures you painted
left my body so tainted
what was simple and light
shining strikingly bright
forbidden desires
lighting my fires
like jeans, memories faded
i've never been so jaded

red stained pieces, broken glass
skeletal invasion, etched into my mass
skull is bleeding, no light up ahead
my soul is retreating like an old waterbed

all my thoughts so forlorn
spinning out of control
symbols burning my soul
calling children of fate
my heart must abate
my patience is worn

I'm supposed to see <font class=""Caption""><b>Frank</b></font> today, but I&rsquo;m afraid I wont be able to because I&rsquo;m going to be running very late.  

Just one of those days, that&rsquo;s all.  Just one of those days.  I just don&rsquo;t want to be alone tonight, that&rsquo;s all.  I guess I deserve it after some of the things I&rsquo;ve done to other people throughout my life.  Karma&rsquo;s a bitch isn&rsquo;t it?

Whatever...I know I&rsquo;ll have a happier day sometime soon...my days are never really consistant, which I guess in a way is good.  It&rsquo;s just that, while I&rsquo;ve never really had any friends until about three years ago, its funny how now, I feel more alone than ever.  It&rsquo;s like an illusion...we just always feel alone. And once we don&rsquo;t feel that way anymore, we feel smothered.  But I know fate will step in somewhere down the road.  And I&rsquo;m going to find my life.

Here it is, my brand-new poetry collection, for anybody who is bored enough and has the time to read it!  It&rsquo;s my honest work, and very personal. I do hope any poetry-lovers will enjoy this. Of course, this will probably be ignored because nobody I know is a crazy poetry-fanatic, lol, but oh well.  I still said what I had to say, whether or not people are listening.

<lj-cut text=""1. The Untamed Water"">
<b>THE UNTAMED WATER</b>
an evening sky
peppered with specks of glistening light
woven through an unreachable dark blanket
by the bruised and calloused fingers of an elderly woman,
dressed in blacks and dark grays.
she sighs heavily as the night air pushes through the grass, trees and
cold, trickling streams
there is nothing but fury and pain in her eyes
empty of tears that will one day return
from the depths of the seas and the deep, deep oceans.
she is a vengeful soul,
without a merciful strand on her treacherous head
of long flowing hair
the untamed water is her dear friend,
responding to her every whim and desire
rising venomously high with an intent to kill,
she cackles dryly
revelling in her revenge.
as many lives are lost,
the elderly woman has had the last laugh
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""2. Hearts That Bleed"">
<b>HEARTS THAT BLEED</b>
WINNER OF POETRY.COM'S EDITOR'S CHOICE AWARD DECEMBER 2004
Hearts that bleed
Eyes that rain
A rock hard place,
Isolated in the desert of ice
I don a black cape
I move in for the kill,
The rock hard place entombed in my mind
I jump the cliff,
My wings that soar,
Gently gliding in the sacred sky
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""3. My Ejector"">
<b>MY EJECTOR</b>
it's a state of confusion
like this love profusion
running through my head
everything that i dread
unsure of where to go
so that i may grow
head is thrusting like fusion
it's a hasty conclusion
all those pictures you painted
left my body so tainted
what was simple and light
shining strikingly bright
forbidden desires
lighting my fires
like jeans, memories faded
i've never been so jaded

red stained pieces, broken glass
skeletal invasion, etched into my mass
skull is bleeding, no light up ahead
my soul is retreating like an old waterbed

i'm feeling suddenly torn
all my thoughts so forlorn
spinning out of control
symbols burning my soul
calling children of fate
my heart must abate
my patience is worn
my ejector is born
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""4. Mind-Trapper"">
<b>MIND-TRAPPER</b>
i've crossed the line, there's no turning back
must think of my assets, not of what i lack
the cloth has been cut, the door is unlocked
a great pulling force of those whom are mocked
insatiable desire, an effortless plane
a selfish endeavor stepping onto the train
freedom awaits, like the wine-stained sky
entrapment contained, i may finally fly
but this is a risk of a broken wing
to give me my story, and a song to sing
i struggle to find my navigational map
with this i shall fall, a treacherous trap
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""5. The Beautiful Stranger"">
<b>THE BEAUTIFUL STRANGER</b>
He's standing there,
So unaware that he is being watched
Just walking now, gracefully down the hallway

Part of me hopes that he is aware of my watchful gaze,
Another part, however, is horrified
As I sit, I vow to one day meet this young gentleman
With whom I shared a city bus with every Monday and Wednesday
For about six months

I can't say yet if I will bed this beautiful stranger
But I must admit I do long for his boyish eyes
To look back at mine
To stare back deeply, if not for a moment, for an eternity
Only not from a distance as I do unto him
But up close, where each and every breath can be felt
On the surface of our cheeks

Or breathing down my neck
As my body turns away from his
His hands slowly but softly roaming my torso and stomach
As he explores, he gets lower and lower
As his fingers dip below my belt
And I close my eyes, lift my head and exhale

Where will this go?
I cannot say,
I'll leave it up to fate
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""6. Social Disease"">
<b>SOCIAL DISEASE</b>
Thought I was on my way
Had a plan
Had a dream
What shallow things must I do?
I think I've caught your social disease
You confused me
You used me
I got a social disease
What must I do to prove to you
Some of it was my fault too?
Now I'm confused
Don't know what to think
I wish I could undo all I did to you
Don't want no social disease
For my world is shaken
Hopes shattered, dreams scattered
I'm so confused
I'm so ashamed
I wish I could see things more clearly
But I can't...I've got your social disease
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""7. Damage Control"">
<b>DAMAGE CONTROL</b>
this is what i want
i've wanted it for a very, very long time
my heart aching for it
every night as i went to sleep
my life based on a simple desire
but is this what i really want?
i'm just living out my dream
and i just realized that i was misled
this is the direction i've brought my life,
and i've got to save myself before i make myself cry
it's easy to sit back
and watch it all be torn down
but i've got to calm it down
if i want to save a life
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""8. Frustration"">
<b>FRUSTRATION</b>
sitting alone in complete frustration
back to the wall in deep meditation
eyes are closed in contemplation
on whether i believe in church damnation
don't know what is false, don't know what is fact
don't know what to think, don't know how to act
wish i had the answers, wish i had a way
wish i knew the difference, night and day
love is powerful, love is song
love is neither right nor wrong
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""9. Out of That Life"">
<b>OUT OF THAT LIFE</b>
Sitting at a bus stop bench
Pondering life and my state
He was not a father to me
Nothing that he wouldn't do to be able to be one
So much warning came
A spot to be replaced
Emptiness left unfilled
Couldn't let him see me cry
Don't know what he'd see right now
It's not like I know what I'm doing anyway

Now there's this other man
Dressed in bright rainbow colors effortlessly
Heart is dark and empty
Looks like he lost someone too
Could I be that filler?
Can I fill that space?
Is there a reason I was brought into this time and place?
There's still another man
What do I hope to gain,
Except heartache and pain?
My heart belongs to myself
It belongs to no one else
Put up a wall and shut it all out of here
But my belief remains
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love
Why must I cry so hopelessly?

Fate will bring me closer
So don't you ever tell me to stop
One must express it all
A victim of a kind of rage
How much could it hurt?
Don't even know which road to take

Maybe I'm still empty too
Maybe that's why I'm still here
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""10. The Lone Eye"">
<b>THE LONE EYE</b>
Here I sit on this soft felt chair
My eyes fixated on the cold ice screen
The light staring right back at me
With no hint of acknowledgement of my existance
Waiting...I sit
Waiting...I breathe
I call out a name, but alas...nobody is there to hear me
Second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour
My eyes burning into the depths of the endless screen
Burning deeper, where there is no end
No fear, no dream
No sign of life for light years ahead
Staring endlessly through the night
Frozen and locked through time and space
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""11. The Anti-Mercy"">
<b>THE ANTI-MERCY</b>
i am trapped here now
how will i escape?
i'm falling like bricks
my head is splitting
my heart is slipping
don't know which one to follow
and which one to ignore
can't follow my heart into a vastly harsh doom
i'm in a cage with a fork in the road
the hard metal banging against my forehead
cannot eat, cannot sleep
cannot laugh, cry, or speak
fine lines between anger and hate
i'm shaken, i'm lost
i need to find my tree
my head is spinning out of control
in total confusion, like my heart
proceeding so cautiously
not knowing what to do
i'm tainted
i'm no longer virginal white
now ripped into colors of darkness aloof
i lower my head and pray for mercy

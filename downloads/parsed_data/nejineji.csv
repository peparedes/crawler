"event","What happened with Hinata-sama... I do not even know how to begin to describe it. Half of me is disgusted with myself for the lack of proper self-control. The other half of me, I'd prefer not to even think about.

I have to keep reminding myself that she is the heir, and the heir foremost. Whatever happens between us is purely physical. 

Hinata-sama does not love me, and I am not allowed to love her.

Aside from problems that cannot be solved, I had a training session with Tenten and Lee. The injured hand from my encounter with Hinata-sama hampered my movements, but I was still able to hold my ground. Hinata-sama showed up in the middle, and Tenten had the audacity to suggest that she bandage our wounds--who does Tenten think Hinata-sama is? A common nursemaid? 

I admit that I was angry, and did not bother to hide that fact. Tenten, however, does not seem to have grown from the genin days--she chose to use violence to prove her point, like a child throwing a tantrum. I held my peace, however. I will never lose my head in front of Hinata-sama--I will never disgrace her that way.

In the village, threats of the Akatsuki have given way to action--even Tsunade-sama is worried. Perhaps my overconfidence was a mistake. I will join the jounin to protect Konohagakure, to protect Hinata-sama, in whatever way I can."

Yesterday, with what happened with Hinata-sama... I would have never thought I would lose so much self control. I am a member of the branch family, it is my duty to serve her. I am no longer a genin, I have lost my bitterness. It is my duty to protect her.

Then why is there something other than duty creeping up? It is pathetic, on my part, the way I allowed myself to behave. Hinata-sama is the Hyuuga heir, I am her cousin. A branch member. The Hyuuga heir always marries into prestigious, powerful families. Branch members... they are of no concern.

This is tradition. It is honorable to serve Hinata-sama. I am not her equal. 

I do not love Hinata-sama.

I apologize for the way I behaved yesterday, Hinata-sama. I will speak to Hiashi-sama about punishment, as a branch member should never overstep their boundaries."

"event","And so this begins.

I asked Tenten to train Hinata-sama this week, as the missions the Godaime have been piling upon us Jounin have been numerous.

What with the Akatsuki's shadow upon Konoha, she wants to make sure all other smaller issues are cleared up before our ninja are all trained on those S-class criminals.

I myself do not see the reason for their concern. The Akatsuki is merely a group of criminals, indulging in their shady pastimes. They will not take Naruto, as weak as he is, when the whole of Konoha is here to stop them.

It doesn't matter. I have matters to attend to."

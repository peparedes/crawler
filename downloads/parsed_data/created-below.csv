I just DDRed 400 calories to get rid of it.&nbsp; This is day 4.&nbsp; There have been some ""fasting mess ups"" but they have been fixed by over exercise or walking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I hope to walk a lot, today, with my friend, and yeah.&nbsp; 

I might get a salad.&nbsp; &gt;.&lt;&nbsp; Due to social influences.&nbsp; But that's OK, I will live.

Oh, and I need help.&nbsp; How do you convince your boyfriend that you're not hungry when HE'S ALWAYS HUNGRY AND ALWAYS WANTS TO EAT.&nbsp; AH!&nbsp; This is going to be difficult.&nbsp; What to do . . . Hm.

Ugh, I need to walk a lot, today.&nbsp; REALLY BADLY.

My friend should be ready by like 5.&nbsp; Hm.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; And I'll try to exercise before that, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Monday, I am done, and I can eat ""SOMETHING.""&nbsp; As in, something normal.&nbsp; Woo.

I'm not really hungry, anyway."

I woke up early to watch my brother, and then went back to bed, UNTIL 1:15.&nbsp; Which was a mistake.&nbsp; I hate sleeping late, I feel lazy.&nbsp; I don't stay up until 5AM, jeez.

But I didn't eat anything all day, and went to a concert.&nbsp; But the day was pretty wasted.&nbsp;

Eh.

Today, I have a party, hopefully, I'll resist.&nbsp; Maybe just A LITTLE.&nbsp; If there are vegetables, great.&nbsp; But I doubt it.&nbsp; This isn't catered.&nbsp; Lol.

I'm playing a bit of DDR (what I can stand) and walking to the party (an hour and a half), so yeah, it should be cool.

So I can make it through a week without eating, I MAY start drinking caffeine/taking pills.&nbsp; I have diet pills, and I'll take them before the party, just in case.&nbsp; On wednesday, friday and sunday, I'm taking my friend's stolen ADD medication (lol), cause it makes me hyper.&nbsp; Woo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

And tonight I may drink caffiene at the party.&nbsp; MAY.&nbsp;&nbsp;

And you know how there are salads with shit loads of calories, and than there are salads with none.&nbsp; Salads with NONE are good for going out places (such as my 3 friends' ""goodbye"" party for college).&nbsp;&nbsp;

I've got this all worked out.&nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; I'm so happy.&nbsp; No eating until&nbsp;sunday.&nbsp; Hoo.&nbsp; Lots of water.&nbsp; And then, I'll slowly incorporate food back, with vegetables, fruits, et cetera.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm only happy when I'm starving, yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Until tomorrow, adieu."

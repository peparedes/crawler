"event","There's this guy in the building across the street (I assume this based on the bookcase I see in the window. How can I do this? I too have a bookcase. I don't know. Too funny. No, the posters on the wall seem masculine too) who always leaves his shades open, and while this would be no problem, it's just about always the only light on over there and it makes me paranoid about leaving <i>my</i> shades open. Once in a while my eye will glance over there and I'll think I'll see a black shadow, and I'll think, ""Oh my God, it's that guy, and he's standing at the window peering over here, because maybe I'm the only one in <i>this</i> building with a visible light on, and he's trying to see me."" I'm laughing at myself, because every time I realize, ""Oh. That's the creepy bookshelf, not a person."" You should really not put a bookshelf right by the window that's about the same height as a person because some idiot across the street who's really tired might get paranoid.

This is mainly me being mad at myself for forgetting to go over and close my shades when it gets to be nighttime. 

Wanted to shoot myself during the lecture today. No more Rothko, pleaaaaaaase. Sorry, but I don't get the appeal; I have absolutely no emotional response to color field painting. And today someone in my row jiggled his or her leg the entire class, thus causing the tabletop to vibrate. I never figured out who that was, but it, combined with my severe hunger by the end of the two hours, started to make me nauseated and actually dizzy. Study group was meh; I miss last term's group.

"event","First-time experience: Good friend admits romantic feelings, knows it won't work out for many reasons, and passive-aggressively lashes out at me, as though it's my fault. It's really frustrating, I'm here to tell you now, I'm done putting up with it. I understand, and I care -- I really do -- but to the extent that I'll be verbally battered, no, that's not going to fly. I'll clip its wings before that happens. I'm also very good at cutting off friendships when they get to be more trouble than they're worth, and I can't imagine doing that this time, but at bad points I have to fight myself in order not to do it. Though if it were to continue on as is, the friendship wouldn't be what it was anyway. I expected awkwardness, but I did not expect and won't put up with things that make me feel guilty because that's just rather ridiculous.

I dropped the seminar course last week. Gosh, that's a long story that I thought I already explained. It's just a joy when an instructor invites you to take a course, you're absolutely delighted, and then apparently some error in the computer system or in human conversation occurs and your request for registration doesn't go through. In this story, you're told by the instructor to come to class anyway. You go to the class the first day, at which point you find out that you're actually one of two students who had this registration problem. The instructor apparently didn't keep an accurate written record of the students and is now terribly upset that there are two people present who are not on her list of attendees. She pretty much throws a fit, and the other kid, he gets a slight attitude about it -- secretly, no one blames him -- and says that he has been fighting with registration for the past month and they had already spoken of this. She tells him, sorry, but they're over the count for the course and he needs to leave. 

I sit there scared to death, wondering what the heck this means for me; does she want me to leave too? I stay seated. She goes through roll and afterward looks up and says to me that I'm not on her list. I meekly say, yes, I'm not, but we've discussed this and she asked me to still come. She barely acknowledges this, but she doesn't tell me to leave, either. 

Then another student enters the room, and I know him, and he is one of the instructor's favorites and -- I learn later -- was invited last-minute to join. He sits next to me, and thankfully for him and his lack of caring, he isn't about to pee his pants in fear. She gets highly irritated at this point and says, ""Well, I'm sorry, everyone, that we're crowded today. It appears there are two people here who aren't supposed to be."" 

I feel like getting up and walking out. This is my favorite professor, mind you, and this treatment is like a kick to the face. I stay sitting, because I'm a little, generally terrified person, but I'm thinking to myself about how in the world she could see fit to behave this way when she had obviously allowed for an error, she had spoken to me and that guy about registration and asked that we still come to class, and she'd obviously invited every person there to take the class in the first place. And now she was putting the blame on us for doing what she asked. She was angry with herself and, with her hate of being disorganized and making a mistake, was not pleased.

I stuck out the class, and I went home, not in tears -- no, I saved those for Mom later. I checked my e-mail to find that I had -- finally -- received a dang response from the administrator in charge of lifting registration blocks.

The woman says that she has put in an override and that I can try to register all over again. I do. I can't because the class is now full. I had been naive, not knowing the system, and thought this administrator could do something for me that would be quick and easy, when this wasn't the case. It would have to be changed in the system by someone else, after getting permission from the instructor and the instructor contacting so-and-so... Mom and I decided it wasn't worth my time. I wrote the administrator and the professor lengthy apologies. 

In a fairly timely manner, the professor wrote me back and in a dry message that might be interpreted as an apology and said that I was still invited to take the course. I said, no, but there was obviously a gigantic registering problem and after seeing that the student count was too great, I didn't want to be a contributing factor to that and I felt it best to take a step back this time. The next day in class she caught my eye when I was waiting in line to sign in, and we spoke, and she visibly felt bad about it. She said I was still welcome to take the class. I visibly felt bad but was reassured by her feeling bad. It was a ""no,"" I told her, and I summed it up to a lie about my schedule and to the other problems and to the idea that I could take the seminar she's offering in the fall (not going to do that). Hopefully she hasn't thought bitterly of me. 

That class is one intense sucker. Golly gee, I don't miss it. She passed around this sheet where you were supposed to sign off on the requirements for the class (30-minute oral presentation -- what? Miss three classes and you fail), and I thought about calling it quits. She'd already basically insulted me, after all. But she wanted you to leave class at that point if you decided you wouldn't sign. She asked if anyone wasn't up for it, and I thought, ""Wow, who would have the guts to get up and leave like this? It's a public affair."" It was dead silent, and I wasn't certain. It was almost a relief when the continued registration errors pretty much made the decision for me. 

These abrupt changes in tense have been nice.

I still have Modern. Oooh, Modern, I love you, but just not Abstract Expression. I thought I might get to liking it more, but no. Still don't like Pollock, still do not like Rothko, at all, and still cannot stand de Kooning's <i>Woman</i> paintings. At one point she was discussing a certain the writings of a certain art critic -- maybe Leo Steinberg -- and started into this strange explanation of the view of the canvas as a woman and the brush as some device of fertilization... I wasn't mentally there after that. Sometimes I think it's all a bunch of B.S., and last class was largely that. I love the history; I don't love the analysis.

Yesterday I bought a rug, and this is super exciting, and the day before that I found <a href=""http://i43.tinypic.com/vs027q.jpg"">the best handmade birdie pillow</a>, and by a miracle from God it wasn't over $50. I am always astounded by the price of a unique pillow.

<i>Karelia, Church of the Assumption</i>

That interior is just-- love. I <i>like</i> simplicity because I love white and lightness, but I'm coming to terms with my loving clutter. I'm not a clean person, and I need to give up this lie of telling myself that I would like a clean house one day. The interior reminds me of a little cafe that a friend in Serbia showed me in pictures: small prints of the Virgin Mary and Christ Child of various sizes, cheaply framed, hung all over the walls seemingly rather at random. It's so humble and interesting to me (and I like gold leaf). You can see the larger shot of the church interior here: http://www.richarddavies.co.uk/woodenchurches/images.html. It's a fabulous collection of wooden architecture. 

In other things, I've stared at the Cathedral of Peter and Paul in Peterhof (not in actuality, of course) for a good 10 minutes. And the Church of Our Lady Hodegetria: love. So many churches were demolished by the the Mongolians and Nazis and other tyrants that I'm surprised these lovelies are still standing in Russia. But the <a href=""http://www.skypalace.org/images/europe/slavic/east_slavic/russia/collection/026.jpg"">Kolomenskoye Palace</a> in Moscow takes the cake. How fantastic is that thing?! It's almost a tie with <a href=""http://www.skypalace.org/images/europe/slavic/east_slavic/russia/collection/033.jpg"">the Church of the Palm Sunday in Totma</a>. 

How can history bore people? Being entirely uninterested in history is one thing that I find incredibly off-putting. Granted, my liking of history is largely a liking of periods in which some psycho took power and destroyed a country or two...

P.S. I got an ""A"" in Modern! I cannot believe it, and I'm extremely curious to see my paper. I still doubt that the professor's response was all positive, not out of pessimism but because she's one tough cookie. But obviously, I didn't flunk it! Ahah. I'm delighted, really. Did you hear the piercing scream at about 1 p.m., when I checked to see if grades were in?"

I've had two weird dreams now about my census papers coming in the mail and me accidentally throwing them away along with a wad of junk mail and then cops with guns showing up at my door. 

In other news, I'm pretty sick of the postal system and its shit. If something doesn't get returned to me in a whole month's time and then emerges from, apparently, a bomb site, half destroyed and with half its contents missing, I think I deserve an apology, <i>not</i> a note telling me that the item is ""undeliverable,"" which really does not tell me anything that I can't deduce from one glance at the envelope -- not that the address was incorrect or anything that reasonably pins the fault on me. They seriously need to change the wording on some of those little stickers they slap on things. It's very obvious that my letter reached some kind of hell-hole rather than my friend in New York, and that is certainly not the destination I wrote on it. The person who finally located the thing and put it back into the system should have felt sickened to see the damage done to it. Sorry, but ""undeliverable"" -- especially after my mail traveling within the states has been ripped open more than once and not even closed back up -- does not cut it. But thanks for the little plastic bag you guys actually took the time to put the envelope in this time only because the car that seemingly ran over it tore it up so much that it actually could not be taped closed again.

My headache is about 20 percent still here. Day 3 and I haven't quite gotten rid of it. I've slept a decent amount, tried staying off the computer and not doing other headache-inducing things, to see if it might ease up, and no, so I've stopped trying aside from taking something to try to kill it off. I hope that night 2 of good sleep will rid me of it entirely. I still need to mop the floor and do things that require a great deal of bending over and causing rushes of blood to the head, and those aren't good activities for someone who already has a headache.

"event","While I'm still enraged by this, I might as well talk about it. To give it permanence. Which I talked about on the photography history final today, which was surprisingly -- or not surprisingly, actually -- easy. At 8 a.m., I sure hoped it wouldn't be awful.

The class before last in Modern, the day before the final, which was the class following everyone having turned in their research papers, we all figured that those who had been idiots and gone over the maximum page limit would get their papers returned to them and automatically get knocked down to a ""B"" as the highest possible grade for the assignment. And I didn't have that happen, and so I was delighted and relieved. Well, we were all dang wrong, because after I handed in my exam, she went to fish for my paper and, as she brought it out, whispered that I needed to revise it and turn it back in within several hours' time because I'd fricked it up (though she said it nicely). My face must have dropped. I'm pretty sure I swore under my breath, and I was visibly angry as I left -- at myself. So I ran like hell home and cut a page outta the thing, miraculously without ruining my citations and having to edit my bibliography and footnotes, and rushed to the art office. And today I've been worrying about whether it in fact reached her. I was fine about it yesterday, but today I recalled, oh yeah, I didn't get to actually give it to her personally and what if something happened. 

The last 24 hours have, essentially, been spent going over how I could possibly be so psychotic about getting it right, because this paper out of all of them was the most important and I want so badly to do well and prove that I won't flake off in the seminar class next term, and then in my head misconstrue one of the assignment's most basic requirements. I mean, how the hell. But I did. And I did because I was in fact so psychotic, I'm sure. What gets me, though, is that I was calm for the final, and I was doing pretty well even though that thing was a hard bugger of an exam. 

Oh, another stupid thing. I got up to turn in the exam and then realized that there were three fill-ins on the back that I hadn't noted. I told her and was beginning to say, hey, I did this, and I'm going to lose the points because I messed up -- but hey, I realize <i>now</i> that I'm brainless and I want to apologize before you see it yourself and wonder how I could have done this. But she said, ""Oh, no, no, go do it then!"" And I rushed over and, bam, knew all three terms and names, one of which was exceptionally simple. When the answer is Picasso, it's simple. Grin, grin, naively go up to turn in the test, thinking the worst is over and I simply overlooked one monumentally obvious thing for which test-takers should always be on the lookout. 

So after I did one stupid thing, I got the majorly stupid thing shoved in my face. She must have thought, gee, what a dope; that's how I felt. 

First of all, it happens to be the best instructor I've ever had, and she is a former copy editor, and a letter of rec from her would do wonders if used in the right place. She knows of opportunities, and my God, I need opportunities if I'm ever going to go back to writing, and I'd like to, if I could find things that are actually of use, because English classes sure as heck are not and I don't want to go back to journalism. And second, yeah, I care. I adored this class, and I love her lectures, and I wanted it badly. The other classes, I didn't want approval there, and of course I didn't screw things up. And third, being who I am, a failure according to the Great Education System of degrees and academic success on paper, it... mattered, I guess, because I am going to have to fight extremely hard to get somewhere on the path I'm taking at the moment. I wanted to use it as a small first step, especially because the seminar class is gonna beat the tar out of me. But I still will get to see her comments on my paper, hopefully, and I will know if there's hope. Fourth reason: That would be that this was the first big paper for her, of course, and she has not much else to go on besides my exam scores and her perception of a seemingly responsible student... who can't read directions, apparently (which is not true! Reason #5.). I am never confusing ""excluding bibliography"" and ""including bibliography"" ever again.

The morning of that final (yesterday), I also couldn't find my keys when I went to leave. I've had this happen before because I'm a moron who can't remember to always put the keys back in her purse immediately after getting home, but I've always found them rather quickly before. Nope, not this time. But I had my spares, thank God, which I'm actually not supposed to have, and I left. (However, they lack the new mailbox key and the then-lost keys include the house key and car key, so that was a problem.) Well, after I got home with my rejected paper to rapidly revamp, and after I did the revamp job and booked it back to the campus to turn in the precious copy, I went searching. I opened cereal boxes, took everything out of the fridge and looked around, dumped out every drawer in the place, tore apart and changed the bed, looked in the garbage. And nothing. I'd told Mom of this on the phone -- hey, Mom, the car keys might be gone -- but she never said, hey, I found a set of keys in my purse earlier that didn't quite look like mine but went ""hrrmmm"" and went about my day. Saturday and Sunday I was holed-up studying and writing for classes and had no use for my keys and thus thought nothing about anything being lost. But the last time I had used my keys was Saturday morning when Mom had come over to, bless her heart, bring potato soup. So I questioned her, and oh no, she didn't have my keys. Yesterday, after the research paper news and lost keys and getting splashed with mud all over my front by a Jeep, and getting home to revise the paper and finding that, by golly, I lacked three pieces of needed computer paper, an otherwise pretty crappy day on four hours' sleep turned into crying and feeling that I'd messed-up almost everything I'd done in the past 24 hours. And then Mom suddenly called this afternoon to say, umm, just remembered, I have a weird set of car keys that I must have thrown in my purse when I was over. Mom, I would have loved to have known yesterday. Loved.

Feeling nice now, though. I'm going to fix some sleepytime tea and go to bed and sleeeeeep in. And hope to God my paper made it to where it needs to be and I can get an ""A"" (a ""B"") and not lower, because lower would probably ruin the ""A"" I'd otherwise have in the class. Tomorrow: cleaning and cleaning."

"event","I turned in my essay for Modern. Gosh, I hope it's OK. I was doing so well last night, in spirit, feeling as though I was calling it quits, and then I said, ""Oh, read it one more time, Lazy,"" and I did, and I found I'd left out the word ""at"" in ""Beckmann did not leave it at that."" I then read it four more times and caught about four more things that warranted changes. It's not particularly comforting. What was a 10 p.m. bedtime became 12:30 a.m. And then after I turned it in, a friend mentioned that it was to be eight pages at most, counting the bibliography, rather than <i>not</i> counting the bibliography. I can't recall the last time an instructor counted the pages including the bibliography. Usually some dumb kid asks, and the answer is always, ""Nooo, ____ pages not including the bibliography/end notes/works cited/whatever."" But not this time, and I forgot. I was told, ""Oh, don't worry. That's just on the verge of being too long, and she knows you, and she'll accept it."" And I do not want to be even ""on the verge."" I am anticipating that she will accept it, in part because I'm in the study group and signed up for her seminar class and she knows of me, but I don't like the idea of my first big essay for her including a screw-up that resulted from not re-reading the three-page-long directions for the twentieth time. She is, like me, One With Reasonable Expectations That Everyone Else Thinks Are Unreasonable. She sees and retains details like only a copy editor can, and I just know she is irritated to no end when people don't read directions. I wanted to go to her today and say, ""I'm sorry! I'm sorry! You don't know what I'm talking about yet, but I need to tell you before you see it: I did read your directions; I am just an idiot!"" 

I have the feeling it will be OK. I do. But I should have read those directions for the twentieth time. 

I feel relieved. I have cramp pains up the wazoooo, and I'm tired and preparing for bed, but I have these chocolate- and peanut butter-covered coffee beans (I know -- what?!) and a postcard from France that arrived from a friend today. Studying will begin tomorrow, and the bills I need to pay, and a checkbook that needs balancing. My stomach's too upset and my insides too inflamed and angry for me to balance my checkbook; too much math.

I have five prints of paintings of people sleeping. I started to write ""spleening."" I don't know what either means. The museum store had a little print of its acquisition <i>Early Hour</i>, by Karl Hofer, and I bought it today for 75 cents. I've always liked it. The dog isn't barking, so I let that part go.

Cutest little dudes, ever.

Efterklang's new album, <i>Magic Chairs</i>, is out. I'm conflicted. Very impressed but conflicted. It's less into orchestral theatrics this time around, though the song ""Mirror Mirror"" (like the natural cheater I am, I admit, I heard that track months ago) is more along the lines of what I expected. This is the most accessible album they've released. It's weird to go from their album <i>Parades</i>, which is just so dense with orchestration and electronic elements and the presence of a choir, to this. Some songs on <i>Magic Chairs</i> are similarly dense, but others are sparse and it feels less like characteristic Efterklang. 

For you, the last track, ""Natural Tune"":

"event","Rebecca sent the most darling stationary today along with a letter. On the outside, they're red shoes with white doves on them and little designs in ivy and black buckles! They're little cards that unfold into three shoe silhouettes, and the inside two are equally cute blue shoes. Too cute to use, I think. I have just two more cards to use for notes to people, though, so I need to probably buy stationary or cards somewhere. 

I'm tired of Hist. of Photography; let's ignore that course. Two guys keep sitting behind me, whispering the entire class period, and putting their feet on my chair despite my very obvious continued scooting closer and closer to the table in front of me. I mean, picking up the chair and making slight noise dropping it again and knocking their feet to the floor. Several times. The class material is just too conceptual for me right now and with too little substance. 

In Modern today, the entire class was spent talking about just <i>Guernica</i>. Granted, I've heard about that piece at least 13 times, but I don't dislike it yet. Even though Picasshole created it. I think that man, from what I've read, had the most affairs that resulted in children of any well-known twentieth-century artist. It was just affair, child, affair, another child, affair, affair, child, affair, pretty much. He just keeeeept it up. 

I fed my addiction to calendar prints today by buying a $4 calendar. Best aspect of the day.

My mother was not feeling well this morning and had a dizzy spell, to which I asked if she's been drinking enough sage tea lately. I worry a bit. It's not as though she lives with someone who's aware of what's going on and who answers his cell phone when he's out, let alone has it turned on. I was intensely upset this morning, when I found out of Mom's dizzy spell, because of that last bit. There's going to be a family emergency one day and his phone will be off, as always, and it's going to be bad. But maybe then some of his double standards will die off and he won't come unglued if my mother doesn't tell him she's going to get gas in the car at a station five minutes away. Oh, probably not. 

She'd almost be happier living with me. I think my cell phone, which -- brace yourselves -- seems to have been released in 2006, if not earlier, is finally on its long (hopefully) road to death, and while I hadn't even mentioned its taking less time to need charging lately to Mom, she noted the phone's age to my father today, which resulted in a bout of barking and complaining that we don't know exactly <i>when</i> I'll need a new phone. He doesn't seem to grasp that it's not about waiting until the thing finally dies and I'm without a phone to then go and replace it. I like the phone. I don't text much and don't need a fancy phone. I just figure that it's going to die at some point and I'm seeing the signs. That and his complete lack of acknowledgment of the fact that the phone is very old in phone years is immensely irritating. He's got it made; I am not demanding a phone at all like anything owned by the rest of the world over the age of 18, if not younger. I've tried to explain about six times that I don't have a full keyboard and, thus, texting is rather cumbersome. That I'm a simple phone person.

Oh well. I need to focus on this essay, and him wanting to know answers should not be a concern right now. My goal: have it basically finished Friday at the latest. I'm going to stretch and do some breathing exercises, have tea, and get this stress out of my shoulders.

"event","I love this class. I love Modern Art to death. It's just the most wonderful way to learn history; art history is, I mean. It's magical. I know that I will look back on the experience later in life and be so grateful for it and severely miss sitting in a darkened lecture hall and looking at slides. The midterm went better than expected. Great, actually. And after the test, the professor approached me (scared me) and invited me, basically out of nowhere, to take her seminar class next term that requires instructor approval. It's Pornography and Representation. Mom: ""Are you sure you want to take that?"" I'm not sure at all. But I signed up for it, hopefully correctly, and the prof. should be be lifting the block on my registration here soon. I had been confronting the idea that I would probably be leaving college to work full-time, because finances are really bad. Really bad. And I've felt an extreme amount of pressure and guilt in this way to get out of there and give it up and work. I've blatantly been told that I need to leave school, which has resulted in tears because it's the correct thing. But then I had this opportunity open up in front of me, and for the first time I felt as though I had someone telling me that I am indeed smart enough to handle art history when I haven't felt and still am not feeling that I'm intelligent enough to handle it. I needed that and need that so badly. So I cried a bit. When I think I've made a hard decision and something cuts it off at the knees, I cry, because I'm a planner. But it was kind of happy crying this time; I just haven't decided what I'm supposed to do. Take the course, I guess, because it would be stupid not to do so, and work at the same time, God permitting, and discover some new coping mechanisms for the stress. 

But this essay is gonna kill me. I've never before gotten five pages into an eight-page paper and realized I was screwing-up the entire thing and had apparently misinterpreted a hint from the instructor as something literal when it was probably in fact something figurative or metaphorical. I did not follow through on my research enough before starting the paper, and I will not do that again. And so I flipped-out last night around 8:30 and suddenly felt 1000 percent more exhausted and went to bed and then had weird chills while trying to get to sleep that I don't think can be attributed to a temperature drop because it's not the dead of winter. And getting up at 6 a.m., the feeling was still scary. I'm only slightly less scared at the moment, and I think that's due to stubborn determination, which is really the most helpful thing. I think I'm going to go in a direction that the instructor may not be hoping for, but I can't pull off what I thought before she wanted and would just end up writing a crappy paper that way. So I'll write a perhaps similarly crappy paper that I hopefully won't find too crappy when I turn it it in, what, a week.

In news you've missed, Snow died. A couple months ago. He had stopped eating almost entirely, and within one month's time he started to look like a cancer patient. It was heartbreaking, and I tried to be home on the weekends so that I'd be around if, ya know. One morning he was gone. I was secretly upset with my mother for calling me into the laundry room to see him on the floor. I have a thing about animals or anyone being buried as soon as possible, and he was buried right away, which was comforting to me. Although we lost a total of three cats in 2009, it was almost as though it was my first loss of an animal. Briar was Mom's cat, and Kiz was just an odd thing who was hard to love because he had so many extreme problems, both physical and mental, and just needed to be put to sleep, finally, regardless of how cruel that felt. I picked out Snow when I was four and made him the obnoxious brat he was. He was mine, though to say that makes me one of those bad parents who obviously favors one child over the rest. Thank goodness for Chloe because I'd still be enormously, enormously upset all the time otherwise. Hooligan is doing well, although we went through a period of two weeks when he suddenly stopped hollering for food every time someone entered the room and sulked in corners and didn't want to be held, period. Considering how much of a bully he always has been, this was strange. He's still spooked if I get home and come in the door with my sunglasses on, or make a movement too quickly when he isn't looking. And he's back to hating his diet, which I guess means he's going to be all right."

"event","Not much new. After classes I panic. I read the textbook and panic a little less. Go back to class and then panic all throughout because I have little idea what is going on. Get home and read the book and feel better. Panic about midterm. Repeat. I really feel that the art course might be a mistake for me. I should be able to get it. I want to get it. But his hypothetical test questions during class usually draw a blank, and that is frightening. Other classes: cake.

I'm about to cook mushrooms. Exciting part of the day. And ""The Office"" is on tonight. So scratch that. ""The Office"" is the exciting part of the day, although the show feels a tad as though it is being stretched as far as it can possibly go. Not that I don't adore it. 

I fear even stepping outside these days. There are typically sirens going off quite frequently, but the past few days it has been seemingly constant. Last night I heard a huge thud... well, not exactly a thud; something between a gunshot and a car bashing into another car that is so pathetically small it shouldn't be allowed on the road (I'm all for saving the planet, but that small?). A big bang of some sort followed by sirens. Now isn't that as vague and worthless a description as ever. Then a couple guys got into a huge fight on the street to the right of my building at 6 a.m. today. Such class. Cops showed up and everything. I sat and listened while having my tea. Sometimes I get overwhelmed thinking about how terrible and violent and self-destructive people are and I don't want to go anywhere or do anything because I'm just bound to be mugged or hit by a car or murdered. And then sometimes I'm overcome by how wonderful others are."

"event","Well, the term has begun, and I'm alive. I don't fancy learning the parts of old churches much, but I'm less frustrated than I was yesterday in class. The man gives something beyond a crash-course every class... I can't begin to describe what it is, but my arm felt as though I'd been hanging from it for hours by late afternoon. Too much frantic scribbling. 

Yesterday morning, while I was finishing getting ready, I heard trickling water. I looked outside. No rain. Then the trickling started to become more than trickling, and suddenly I saw water coming down the shades on the bathroom window, followed by water coming through the ceiling light (I was not standing underneath it -- thank you, God). The amount of water doesn't quite warrant the phrase ""gushing,"" but it was darn close. The floor had a couple centimeters' worth pretty quickly. At first, I was just stunned. I grabbed my stuff, attempted to dodge the waterfall, and got outta there, threw on a sweater over my pajama top, and took off out of the apartment and down the stairs in my fuzzy slippers. I expected there to be noise -- others coming out from their apartments, maybe -- but nothing. Came upon the guy with the Dali mustache who fixed my bad doorknob a few weeks ago. ""Uuuuuumm, my bathroom is flooding..."" Anyone will do; just fix it. Fix it, fix it, fix it. 

And so he followed me up with his fanciful, heavy contraption (I forget the noun; forgive me) and sucked up some of the water. Was he surprised about the flooding? He didn't seem so. But yet he'd been working in the bathroom in the place above me on a bad pipe to the toilet, and when it came off in his hand and water went everywhere, he didn't think the problem would reach me down below. The pipe came off in your hand. I would wonder, personally. 

He's working on the bathroom right now again, because I can hear him up there. I keep waiting for something. I heard water five minutes ago and ran into the bathroom like an idiot, but I think it was just someone flushing his toilet. Paranoia."

"event","Long story short, my parents' downstairs is falling apart. The shorter version would be ""My parents' house is falling apart."" 

For the past several weeks, the bathroom has been stuffier than normal. Sure, it has been ungodly hot much of the time anyway, but nonetheless it has been weirdly humid. Then Mr. Toilet finally said ""To hell with it"" and started leaking. Then the hot water died one morning. There is more than one leak in the waterline under the floor... and under the concrete that is under the floor. The tile floor in the bathroom is warm because of the leak (huh, so that's why the cat has been laying there a lot). Drilling needed? Oh yes. Men are apparently coming over tomorrow to plan how much of the wall that Mom stenciled will have to be cut out and how much of the floor and tile work will be ruined. 

The two older crabby cats live in the laundry room, because after years and years and years they still refuse to interact with any other cats, and the laundry room will pretty much be drilled to death as well, so the cats will need to be moved to the upstairs bathroom, which is small. They're going to be angry and scared. I would much rather flee back to the apartment, even though another heat wave is coming, but I have cat work to do, apparently. (Oh tell me more!) And I guess Mom and I will continually be driving to my apartment to shower. 

The oldest cat, at 18, is refusing to eat right now. I'm really worried. He is too skinny already. Another story there. 

Let's just say that the plumber who first came to the house to calculate the estimated cost was an absolute jerk. He was apparently 60 years old and had retired but then come back to work. Unfortunate that is. I've never seen such a creep with such little respect for women. 

1) I was doing my best to obviously stay out of the way the entire time, sitting at the computer in the family room with headphones on. And somehow my stupid father went into the other room to answer his phone and left Plumber Creep looking at things in the bathroom. Plumber Creep decided to come out of said bathroom and wander into the next room, where I was, to ask me for an e-mail address. 
a) He came up behind me and put his hand on my shoulder. I jumped out of my seat. Apparently I couldn't hear him, of course, but come on. You're a strange man in someone's home, and you decide to do this?
b) And why the hell had he taken the liberty of wandering into a room where he was not invited? He could have waited a minute to get the answer to his question from the idiot who was in charge of the whole meeting.

2) After I felt my space had been invaded, Creepy Old Man Plumber seemed to completely miss the fact that I had been scared spitless and said, ""Hi, I was gonna ask your dad for an e-mail address where I could send the numbers, but then I saw there was a sweet little lady over here, and I thought I'd ask the sweet little girl for an e-mail."" 

<i>""Sweet little girl""?</i>

When my moron father returned to where he was supposed to be in the nick of time (him walking away: curse words here), Creeper asked him for the e-mail. But then Creeper said the following: ""OK, I'll send the numbers to the sweet little girls at the office, and they will e-mail you."" 

What the heck is with this man and that phrase? I was totally disgusted by this point.

But the topping on the cake was the creep's final comment to my father before he left: ""Awwww, look at those poor little girls in there <i>(pointing to my mother and me on our computers)</i>. You can always smell ladies without hot water."" Then there was a long pause among laughing, and then he finally threw in the phrase ""The perfume."" 

I wanted to get up and kick him in the nuts, but by this time I was more in shock than anything, about someone having the nerve to say such a thing. For anyone to think that they can come into your home and behave that way is beyond me. You come in, do your job, act politely, and leave. Thank God he is not actually doing the work on the house or there would probably be a very nasty confrontation. The whole thing gives me a goddamn headache just writing about it."

"event","Previously mentioned spider was absent all of yesterday; that is, until evening, when I went in the old room to scope out the place and contemplate my sleeping arrangements. The awful thing was not in my bed again -- thank you, God -- but was on my headboard. When I turned on the light and made a noise, it started to take off up the headboard, and I knew there was no way that I'd be able to kill the damn thing myself; it was just too bloody fast, and I was just too bloody nervous about doing it. But thank you, Mother, the great spider killer. I'd never been so disgusted by a spider in my life.

Oh. And then I saw a baby spider hanging from the ceiling, so that tells me that the baby spiders are not all deceased. Great. I just wanna bug-bomb the whole freaking house. I don't know where we'd possibly take the cats in the meantime, but I want those damn spiders gone. 

I got up at 5:15 to throw myself together and drive to the apartment to see if my plants had died and with the hope of it being cooler in there than it will be this afternoon. It's definitely in the upper 80s, easy. At 6:20 a.m., even. There's no doubt in my mind that it will reach 100 in the living room by early afternoon. Fall term is gonna be hell, regardless of the fact that my aunt wants to give me her old air conditioner. 

Does anyone recall the Christmas animation film ""The Snowman""? I don't remember seeing it as a kid, but I must have at some point. Somehow, I ran across it the other day on YouTube and just about cried. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeVaj4zkWy0

I wasn't equipped with hairspray. I was naive and unknowing. I went in my old room (still at home currently -- damn the heat) to go to bed. The lights were still on. In a second, you'll know how important that part is to the story. 

I pulled back the sheets so that I'd be able to easily slip into bed. And as I pulled back the sheets, out came a good-sized black spider running at full speed. It ran so damn fast that I wasn't able to smack the thing with something, so God only knows where it is now. I wasn't able to kill it with hairspray. I immediately started tearing everything off the bed and shaking it to ensure that nothing else was in it (aka an insect family). Nothing else emerged ... I mean, no insect family emerged.  

I am not sleeping in there. (Tomorrow, even?) Couch it is. So I can guarantee I won't get much sleep tonight. Nightmares? Probably. Pissed off? Yes, a bit. And don't even ask; I am changing the sheets first thing in the morning. Not that I really am excited about going in there."

Not that I didn't know the material; I did, or as well as I could considering the circumstances. It was simply an extremely hard test, primarily because it covered a ridiculous amount of information. Like, we covered the first 50 years of the 20th century in one class. She's a speedy little woman, the instructor. I miss the course (and the study group peeps), but thank God that exam is over. The study group is supposed to be planning a BBQ sometime soon, but alas, the study group leader is supposed to plan it, and he is male and, therefore, cannot manage to contact people at anything other than the very last minute. And then he wonders why it doesn't work out.

The job market is terrible. What's new. How am I supposed to know that things will all work out...

My shirt sleeves are bugging me this morning. I hate when shirts have short sleeves that are so short that they really have no reason to exist. They dig into the arm pit in an uncomfortable way (as though they could dig into your arm pit in a comfortable way?). If you're gonna have sleeves, have some sleeve there! One inch's worth is really not a sleeve in my book. 

Mum and I are going to see the film ""Earth"" tomorrow. I miss the cats. Chloe was spayed a week ago today, and she is doing really well. I'm pleasantly surprised that she has not bothered her stitches. 

I had a dream about my wedding last night. It gave me a cute idea for wedding favors. I would like to take little sheer organza bags and put some wild bird seed in them, and then at the reception or while the guests are waiting for the couple to leave the church, they could be outside and could be feeding little birds if they wanted... because it would be in a park or by a park or something. I haven't planned this. I imagine little kids liking it. It seems sweet to me."

She said that she could order some from a certain art movement, if I'd like, and that I'd get a call or e-mail when they'd arrived and I could go look at them. I await that message. 

One of the prints I bought is by an artist I know nothing about, and I still cannot say why I like it. It's overly dark -- a little more so in my copy than in the following image. And the artist was a member of the Academy and largely painted classical subjects. Not like me at all. But, somehow, I felt as though I would deeply regret it later if I did not buy this print.

She died last Friday night. She was seven months old. It's really hard, and I don't understand. I am thankful for the individuals who were supportive while she was sick, and I'm sorry to say that this is how it turned out. The surgery kept her alive for three months longer than she would have lived if she had gone without it.

The first night in the apartment was OK. Initially, I was a bit weirded-out by the quiet and solitude, but then I came to the realization that I had stupidly left one important cord for my laptop at the house (crap, crap crap), which eventually resulted in the parents dropping it off on their way to dinner. Seeing them (and wanting them to go away) made me realize that I was, or should be, sickeningly content, and I've been great since. However, I have been restless to do things during the day, and I almost killed Nicholas today when he was unsure whether he'd have time to make a trip to Powell's with me before one of his outrageously long bike rides.

But it worked out and we walked a lot. Walked to the university, where they have none of the textbooks I need for this term in stock yet. None. Then walked to Powell's. We had more than one opportunity to catch a trolley or bus, but each time we saw the trolley or bus off in the distance and then saw it leave. So we walked. My feet should be more tired, I'm thinking, but perhaps the immunity is already developing. Still, I'd like to not completely walk to the campus for class. I don't know. At least spring is coming/here. The streetcar map kind of looks like Arabic or something to me right now, but I'll examine it later to see my options. 

At Powell's, I made the huge mistake of asking to go look at the art section. I almost cry when doing this in little Barnes and Noble, so I don't know what I was thinking this afternoon. I don't need any more coffee-table books, truly, but now I have three more. Ten-dollar books. Big, beautiful, old hardcover books. I opened one and a card fell out. The card was probably written in the early '70s, based on the personal message written on the first page of the book. It was a birthday gift, according to the card. Inside the book is the following message, written in brilliant calligraphy:  

<i>Spring, 1971
Mimi,

I hope this will always bring back good memories of the East.

Love, 

Jim</i>

It is such a personal, only-you-will-understand-this message that stupid, sappy me started tearing up. I hate that these books have been given up, but I am so glad that I own a few of them now. I wanted to take them all. I don't know why it upsets me so much, but it does. On the other hand, I almost don't feel right about having them.


My aunt and cousin came to examine the apartment early today and loved it. We had tea. It was a peaceful, nice time, unlike the always-headache-triggering experience of taking my grandmother downtown, which was attempted yesterday morning. 

Last night was much nicer than the first night. Why? Ear plugs. I can handle the street noise -- with frustration, but I can handle it. The sirens? Not so much. I have never had a reason to wear ear plugs before, and now I feel dumb. Those things are wonderful."

Today, Mum and I went on a cheap-art-print search at little art galleries, home-decor stores, and craft stores, which have a cruddier collection of prints than they did a year ago. My secret goal was to find a Klimt print. ""The Kiss"" is always the image that people automatically associate with Klimt, and I do love it. Not my favorite, but I adore it. And I found it today. I am disappointed because it is a thin, vertical print that is only a fraction of the full piece, but it was $6. I'm sure that it'll be lovely on my wall. Not sure whether it would best fit in my bedroom or the living room. Maybe in the living room, by the bookshelf, if it can't be crammed in my overcrowded bedroom next to my dresser. Oh, that dirty old man who had a ton of cats... so dear to my heart.

I also bought a new teapot today! My fifth one. It is a serious, serious addiction, and if anyone wants to know what I'd like for my birthday or Christmas or whatever, a teapot. 

After the teapot triumph, I ventured into Goodwill and found the cutest coaster set, too. I am proud to have saved its life for $2. The coasters look like tiny red drawers that are on the front of a miniature red wood barn. They slide out, of course. I will set it on my coffee table. It will match my red chairs as well as my red and white dining room table set.

A list of all the things I'm excited about:
1) the dining room table and chairs -- the table top is white, the table legs and chair backs are a shiny red wood, and the seat cushions are red and were recently re-covered by the girl who is addressing you now. It was purchased by its original owner in 1970, and it still looks great. 
2) my bookshelf -- I'm bloody excited to finally have a bookshelf and cannot wait until the stinking shelves actually fit into it like they're supposed to; they must be sanded down. 
3) my bedroom set -- gorgeous, all things considered. It is truly much more than I anticipated. The mattress is super comfy -- more comfy than my bed at home, which is odd -- and the down comforter is the prettiest, softest, warmest thing on Earth. It is a lovely sage green. 
4) the previously mentioned ""coaster barn.""
5) my new aloe vera plant (!!) -- the pot is red, also. I'm overly excited about a stupid plant, yes."

Briar has not developed an infection as a result of the surgery, which is very good, but there's always a chance of it happening if she does something such as try to jump and in the meantime affect her stitches or somehow end up with drainage in her colon. And there's also a chance of cancer, because the doctors -- even cancer specialists in California -- don't know what caused the major colon swelling, let alone the weird bumps that were developing in there, which they had never seen before. Hopefully by next Wednesday we will have heard back from the emergency care clinic about the results of the tissue samples that are currently being analyzed at labs in Oregon as well as Washington, California and wherever else they were sent. My mom is holding it together much better than she was, but we are terrified that it is in fact a very unusual kind of cancer. Yes, it would be extremely, extremely unlikely for a kitten not even six months old to have cancer, but considering how bizarre Briar's condition has proven to be thus far, I wonder how likely it is that she will never experience a problem again."

"event","So, everything is rather a mess. I don't have much writing time, or I shouldn't, because I have an overload of homework and it's getting closer and closer to midterms, and it would be smart if I started working a little harder. The timing could not be worse, though.

Because I don't have blogging time, I am going to virtually paste a copy of a note (book) I wrote a friend yesterday regarding what has been happening. That will be faster. Though, I feel like I'm cheating. 

Basically, Chloe is fine, just perfect, and Briar is very ill. It could be cancer, although the chances are very slim. The only reason we still question it being cancer despite the small chances is because all of the medical findings of the past few days have completely surprised the doctors. It is pretty much a large question mark.

Briar, the older of the two kittens, started throwing up her food a couple of days ago, and so she had a couple of vet appointments to see what was up. She was put on medication, and temporarily it seemed to help. Then, the night before last, she started throwing up constantly again, and so we took her to the vet. The vet examined her and felt that something was swelled inside her stomach area, something that hadn't been there just two days prior. He recommended that she have surgery that night.

So it was a bit scary, to say the least. First, the vet did X-rays, and he said he'd call us with the results. The results didn't show us much, but it did make it seem as though her intestines were significantly swelled-up. The vet, who has always been really good with all of our cats over the years, was unsure what had suddenly caused the swelling, and while he thought he had a good idea what the surgery would require, he said he would be more comfortable if a surgeon at a local emergency clinic conducted the procedure because it would be more routine for them than it would be for him.

So... we drove the poor kitty downtown to a clinic. They wanted a down payment of a few thousand dollars we don't really have to spend. But it was important. It was sad leaving her there, but we did, and they told us that they'd do the surgery as soon as they could that evening.

What our vet and the surgeons at the emergency clinic all thought was that Briar had either swallowed a foreign object of some kind and it had gotten twisted up in her intestines OR she had an intestinal condition that is relatively uncommon in kittens in which, during a bowel movement, one intestine shifts slightly and slips inside the other. If the intestines had moved inside one another, the surgeon would need to move them back in place. I didn't even know it was possible for one intestine to go inside the other.

But it wasn't either of those things. When they got into surgery, they found that she hadn't swallowed anything, and although multiple surgeons thought it was going to be the weird intestinal condition, it wasn't. Her intestines were actually OK, but the problem was/is in her colon. It had swelled to twice its size, apparently in a couple days' time, and her lymph nodes were swelled-up as well. That is normally a sign of cancer, but the surgeons ran some basic tests and it didn't show up as an obvious cancer... though there's no telling if it's a more unusual cancer or not cancer at all. We still don't know and may not know unless something goes drastically wrong later on. What she had before surgery was likely genetic, as no one has determined the cause, and so there's still a big unknown.

Unfortunately, the night continued going badly at this point because the surgeons at the emergency clinic were not familiar enough with the surgery procedure Briar needed. So they had to stitch poor Briar back up, let her wake up and wait over night until she could be driven to a specialist early the next morning. Meanwhile, it was pretty ugly and my mom was a total mess because the doctors were unable to identify what in the heck was wrong with her kitty, who isn't even six months old.

Briar ended up having surgery that morning at the specialist's clinic, and the specialist called several hours later, finally, to tell us that it had gone well and that now we have to wait to see if she continues to recover. They are keeping her for another day at this point, most likely. The 48 hours following that surgery are crucial. There's a 30 percent chance that an infection could develop as a result of having removed the part of the colon wall that swelled so significantly, and if that were to happen, there would be only about a 15 percent chance that she could be saved. That infection would probably start to destroy her colon altogether and would be life-threatening, especially for a kitten as young and as tiny as Briar. But so far, there hasn't been an infection; we just hope one doesn't emerge later. 

So there has been a lot of hoping and praying here. Thank God I didn't have class on campus yesterday, as I was going on little sleep."

Mom periodically pisses me off with her hesitance to tell anyone that I will indeed be moving out. It's not my fault that the jerk we live with still thinks everything costs, or should cost, what it did in the 1950s; her hesitance in addition to that really bugs me. I need support and a kick in the rear -- a ""You can do it! Suck it up! It'll be exciting and rewarding!"" if you will -- not doubts. I have enough doubts and fears as it is."

We have a second kitten now. Surprise, surprise. I certainly was when Mom said that she wanted to ""go see"" the kitten and see what we thought (with the cat carrier mysteriously in the back of the car). We got the little thing, what, three weeks ago? Four? It seems like longer than it has most likely been. Mom named her rather quickly; she did so a few hours after we brought her home, which is really unlike her. Chloe is what she decided on. I think it suits the baby.

Briar was delighted from the second we brought Chloe home from the cat shelter. Over time, it has become increasingly apparent that Briar is remarkably similar, in personality <i>and</i> physical appearance, to the kitty Mom lost during my senior year of high school and still mourns. Their habits are so similar that it's kind of freaky. 

It's snowing all right. Yep. Today, despite my cold and the fact that I shouldn't be going outside in the cold, I am quite happy. For the past week, the snow has been somewhere between pathetic and decent, and then the rain has come and immediately ruined it. Or the wind has arrived and blown everything to hell. Now, it is rather pretty, and I'm waiting to see if it lets up so that I won't risk getting the camera wet. 

It kind of stinks that I most likely won't get to meet two friends for Cold Stone (yes, in the cold, but it's our thing), though. I dislike that, especially because we have Christmas presents to exchange and my presents, stupidly, are lovely blown-glass Christmas ornaments. Dumb move on my part, but who knew that the snow would actually still be here.

So, want to see photos of Chloe? <lj-cut text=""Yep..."">

"event","I just had a bad dream about the university. I had apparently registered for classes with no problem. It was the first day of the term. I had gotten to the campus without a bus driving off the road and without being mugged. But when it came time to actually find my first class, I realized that I hadn't printed off my schedule online, and thus I was in a terrible state of panic. So I ran around, looking for a computer to use; instead, I found my friend Jess, from the paper. She looked up my schedule online for me, and by then I was late, of course.

Then we found that my schedule had unusual marks on it, like the words ""transferred out"" by two of my courses. I hadn't truly been registered for those classes. Instead of an art history class, the academic advisers wanted me to take a swimming class (because there is a lot of fruit in still-life pieces; fruit is related to nutrition; nutrition, to your health... and therefore swimming was the obvious wise choice). I can't remember what the second ""transferred out"" class was; it's all a bit of a blur. 

In nice news, I know what my major Christmas presents will be. I love watching over Mom's shoulder as she orders from Etsy. Unfortunately, my initial request came in the mail a couple of days ago, and it turned out to be a piece of crap. It was what looked like an amazing sterling silver cuff bracelet with flying birds carved into it; it was perfect for me. I was really mad about how that turned out -- get a better camera, damn it, and take absolutely clear photos of your products! The edges of the cuff were extremely rough -- they probably could cut someone -- and they weren't even, either. The entire surface of the silver also looked scratched -- not in an artsy way, like the artist tried to claim when approached with the problem, but in a way that screams poor workmanship.

I was really, really torn about the beaded necklace I was going to ask Mom to buy (since the cuff idea fell through). They're spendy things, though I understand it based on the variety of spendy beads used. I was really torn between a very autumny one and another... on which I ended up deciding. (Ashley ""Slutface"" Larkin would like this lady's work.)

Well, she definitely is not, we found out. She is perfect. Sweet, so playful (but not tearing apart the house), and darling as can be. 

Her name is Briar (name is nearly set in stone), and she is about 12 weeks old. She was most likely the runt in her litter, as she is absolutely tiny for her age, but she may have been the only kitten, or at least the only one to survive. Briar was found alone on the side of a country road in Colton, Ore., caught in some brambles and weeds. The meaning of her name comes into play in this respect; it is associated with brambles or a small tree or rose among thorns."

I have been working on a list of potential names. 

In happy things, I had the most amazing experience today. I was initially going to say ""pleasurable experience,"" but that sounds disgusting. At Bed Bath and Beyond are several black chairs with cushions on them. The cushions are massage-giving cushions. I had no knowledge of shiatsu massage, really, and I was stunned. My shoulders felt significantly better when I finally kicked myself into getting out of the chair, and I now hold the opinion that that $200 cushion would be the best Christmas present on the face of the Earth. It would never happen."

"event","It saddens me that David Reinhard is leaving <i>The Oregonian</i>. 

I admit, I have never been a consistent reader, despite my enthusiasm and respect for journalism, not to mention my curiosity. By curiosity, I mean that Reinhard has been virtually the lone conservative in the <i>Oregonian</i> world, which has prompted me that much more to read his columns. I've been curious to see what the man would say and, more importantly, how he would say it. Usually, I've just searched Reinhard's work online and read up every once in a while. And smirked. Sometimes grinned and, in my head, clapped over the little things. 

But I must say, in an understanding manner, I cannot imagine going in to work and immediately being greeted by someone seeking to argue about politics. What a way to start your morning. I hate mornings to begin with. 

On one side, I imagine that it's weirdly invigorating to be the outsider, the one challenging the norm, knowing that aside from all the criticism, there are readers who appreciate you, and knowing that what you are doing is meaningful. However -- how lonely it must be. The role must require a significant amount of self-talk, or it would for me. 

For a conservative columnist in this state, the number of positive letters to the editor must be unbelievably small. It has to be quite lonely for the writer -- to go to work and be fought, day after day, year after year. You might have friendships in the workplace nonetheless, but would those individuals respect you? They might admire you for your guts, but your intelligence?

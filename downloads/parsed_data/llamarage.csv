This cannot go on. I can't stand this. Why must we even think of war? I know that it is sometimes nessacary to prove something. But this is just really stupid. I have been listening to sad songs all morning because I can't stand this. Its just too much. I haven't been alive for any of the other wars (obviously) and I don't exactly know what happens. We are going to have soo much guilt inside of us once we start killing people in Afghanistan/Iraq/Israel. Wherever the hell we are gonna send troops to. Anyways, leave comments if you want. IM me on riotboy1 to comfort me."

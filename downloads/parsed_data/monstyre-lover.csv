"event","Man, it feels like summer has gone on forever. Maybe thats because i havent been my usual introverted self as of late. Here are some of my hilights of the summer so far:

*Bought a new (used) car - 99 Dodge Stratus
*Went with Trish to see Even In Blackouts, got Jughead to sign my CD
*Got afore mentioned car towed while at afore mentioned concert
*Got suspended from work for being late 4 times (i have to be more careful now)
*Didnt go on family vacation with my parents/sisters
*had people ive never met before over at my housealmost everynight this past week
*Hung out with Bob fucking Suba, hell yeah! You know what im talking about trish *wink wink*
*Met what Dan Aiello will be like @ 23 - ha
*got to see Matt, my ""brotha from anotha mutha"" while he was home from the Navy

"event","Man i was really hpoing that by the end of summer i would be able to get myself a VW Bug . . . thats not gonna happen . . . the other day, friday, i think, i totally FRIED my transmission on the way to work, it was so bad i almost didnt make it across North Ave. getting into the Menards parking lot, so right now i have in my possession about $750 to get a new car, because it wont even be worth getting this fixed since i have other peoblems with my car that would need to be adressed too. I get paid this week tho, so that will be another 160, and my aunt said she'll give me 500 from an account she had started for me when i was younger.

In other news my mom has so been pissing my off as of late. She'll tell my whole family how im such a big help and how i do so much for her blah blah blah and then when tehy leave she fucking bitches me out about being such a lazy ass and if i dont do what she says i can just fucking leave since im almost 18 anyways. And shes totally blaming me for what happened to my car. and yeah it was my fault, but it was intentional - i was drcing my car friday morning and had NO PROBLEMS my trans wasnt slippping, nothing, with is a sign of low fluid, and it slips worse the less you have, well, guess what no slipping, and yet i had like no trans fluid, hence the reason it fried. I cant belive that a month of summer has passed already. 

Our pool is up, its fucking huge. 

My poor car, sitting all alone in the Menards parking lot. man that was a bad day . . . 

Thats all for now

Oh to Pat, 
im not avoiding you, ive just been busy and pre occupied, and i havent been talking to any of my friends or hanging out with anyone because when im nmot working at Menards im babysitting, so unless you want to do something that involves my sisters,  its hard to do stuff.

To sir Pat:
My sister misses you and wanted me to tell you that you should have gone to see H.P. #3 with us and Sir Carl . . . How did the move go? by the way"

"event","Man, i really freaking hate my computer sometimes. But the tech support guy i talked to was really helpful, so yeah. So, a lot has gone on since i last posted.

Prom, it was fun, i mean for prom. Im not really a dancer so i had fun despite the whole dancing part. Post prom was so much fun, Suzanne let Pat, Matt Frankland, Marci W. Dan A. and Ashley I. use her condo. Its in the River West neighborhood, it was really awsome, even though we didnt really do anything. Matt and I totally pissed dan off, that was funny. He thought we were gonna get killed because we walked 2 blocks to Rock n Roll McDonalds at like 2:30 in the morning. Its open all night,and there were tons of people outside anyways, it was Saturday night, so we left and he got all pissy. It was fun tho, Matt and i got a chance to talk and stuff. Hes a cool kid. I'll miss him. Yep yep. Marci was so fun too. Shes so silly.

Graduation, that was yesterday, i dont feel different. Not feeling like an ""adult in the real world"" yet. whatever. I just hope that ill get enough money this summer from working @ Menards and graduation gifts to get a new car. Mine is starting to be totally lame and clunky and not fast. Its sad . . .  My mom kept making me cry yesterday - it was sad, she kpet talking about my grandpa, and how he must be so proud of me and stuff. and it just makes me miss him so damn much, i wish he were here . . .
 
Summer is here! I hope that i'll get to hang out with all my friends a lot mre than i have in the past, and i hope that i get to an excercize plan that i can stick to so i can loose some weight, that would be nice. Ive gained all my weight back since swimming ended in the fall. Sad Sad Sad.

Thats all for now
Peace out my hommies - not that anyone really reads this.

Love and Love and Stuff"

"event","Man, so i left my window open last night . . . my seat was all wet this morning, not to mention i spilled a whole water bottle on my seat yestreday afternoon, so both the front seats were all wet. . . that sucked. I got a job today, doing afternoon cashier work, the pay blows royally, but its better then nothing. So i took a nap today and i had the wirdest dream here are all the people who were in it:
Stefin, Pats friend
Patricia
Bajah
Lilli
Mike C
Nikki C
Sam, my brother
Shaq
Prince
and an iguiana

So i was at my house, and i calles stefin, and he came over, and we sat on this swing that Jamie has built for my mom (in real life he did) and asked him to go to prom with my friend Laura, and he said yes. Then i was at work at Powers Towers, Patricia and i were working together, only the room we were working in was her bedroom in Bajahs house. Bajah decided we ere done for the day, so she called Shaq to drive us home, and he had an iguania in the car, it freaked me out... then we were at work again, and patricia and i were on this bed on the floor hanging out with Bajah and Prince, and my brother came in, and prince was asking if i am sexually active, and i didnt want to lie to prince so i said yes, in front of my brother, and he left the room freaked out, then mike and nikki came in, and there were pictures of Nikki on the wall, and she loves prince, but then they both left. Then bajah decided it was time for us to go home, so prince drove us home, i was in the seat behind prince, and he was driving a black hummer, which bajah drives too, and then he kept getting into accidents, and i kept smacking into the seat infront of me, which was princes seat, for some reason i didnt ahve on my seat belt, which is odd, i almost always wear one... but then he dropped us off and that was it, i woke up.

odd, no?

by the way heres a link to my prom dress, yay!

"event","I took my sisters to go see 13 Going on 30. I really wanted to see it, but i took them along, cuz i knew they would like it. It was really cute. There's a total sap in me that i have tried to supress my entire life almost, cuz i think its kinda lame to be all well, sappy. But lately, ive been allowing myself to get more and more lame, and squishy. The movie was really cute, and watching it made me want to be in love. Its a little depressing, as well as motivating, i guess, since it makes me want to go out and like find my soul mate. Going back and thinking about and lloking at all my poetry that ive written i realize how much i miss being ""in love"" although thats what most people search their entire lives for, so i guess im not alone. I wanna just have fun, and ignore the emotional consequeces, but i cant. I suppose i could if i found someone that i can objectify like that. Whatever, i dont know what im saying. This weekend was fun. I went out to pats. saw the ""gang"" -  i also laughed so hard that i choked and then laughed at myself choking, then laughed some more when pat was telling me to stop laughing so much. it was funny. heh. so i gave blood on friday. it wasnt bad at all. i was the anticiapation of giving or rather getting stuck with the needle, but it was easy. and i didnt feel sick or anything afterwards, a lot of people got all woozy and stuff, but i was fine, in fact i was a little hyper. ype yep yep. i wanna go see mean girls, it looks funny. the girl from party of 5 is in it. did u know she does the voice of eliza thornberry on the wild thornberries?

indeed it is a small world after all."

Today was day of silence - i wasnt very silent. i forgot my papers at home, so i decided not to do it. Oh well.

Pat thinks that i cant control myself - but i will - you just wait and see pat.

I love the word buger - its just funny to say over and over again.

i dont know why i just said that.

I thought my beautiful fiancee was inocence itself until I met her parrot. She had taught it to say terrible things. Wank. Beaver. Fist-Fuck. Stick it up your Jap's eye. I was disallusioned to find she had taken such delight in training an unknowning bird to swear. My love diminished, but i didn't cancel the wedding. The parrot was in the church. When the man asked whether anyone knew a reason for us to not marry, it squaked ""Cunt Flaps!"" My bride bent double over with laughter, and even though we made our vows I knew that the marrige was over.

"event","SO the title basically sums up my trip to the great state capital. I won second in my event, freaked out a bunch of super sonservative hicks from like 6 hours south of Chicago who drive tractors to school, that was fun, because of all the people i associate myself with im probably one of the least freaky looking, or rather most conventionally normal. . . Twords the end of the trip Allison was really pissing me off, but we both got over what was pissing us off, so it was cool.

Funny side story - while my car was sitting in the school parking lot from thursday morning to saturday afternoon, the inside of my car got so hot that my clock, which is attatched by velcro melted off the dash board - that was funny.

So anyways we had ""Erotic positions, by Allison"" that was cool, later we found semi-fresh blood on her sheets, that was sick. Later we had an ice fight which was hillarious, and wet.

Amanda and i went down to the pool, and at first it was empty, but then like a million came, but of them was this really sexy judge, that my freshman jason had. The guy is problably like 21 or something, and has a one inch plug is his one ear and then a smaller on in the other, well anyways, hes totally sexy and he got into the hot tub with us, it was great, and we kept bumping into each other.

Hmm, well i guess thats all about Springfield . . . Im just glad im home tho."

"event","I consider myself an avid reader, of almost everything and anything.

I love fiction, especially modern thriller mysteries, non-cheesy love stories, and as for non-fiction i like reading about people i admire, and erotica, but only if its well written

I regularly read the Chicago Tribune, and whenever i can get my hands on it, the Reader, and the Onion. 'Zines are never really at my disposal, so i guess i dont really read them, though i do like them.
 Some of my fav. authors are 

1 James Patterson
2 John Grisham - i just finished the Summons like 5 minutes ago
3 Francescia Lia Block
4 V.C. Andrews (the only exception to my chessy love story rule)
5 Patricia Cornwell

Other authors i like, though havent read much of: ben weasel, ive been reading stuff he wrote thats online,  my old english teacher Virginia Foley, Margaret Mead, Dean Koontz, i really liked him, just havent been in a Koontz mood lately.

A reason i love to read is 1 it makes me feel better about wasting away time, becuase at least im not wwatching tv, it makes your mond work, ya know, 2 I find it faily easy to get into a book, its a form of meditation for me, so i do it often 3  it inspires me to constantly reevaluate my life, and makes me think about where i am form, where i am now, and where i am going.


on another note, things from my past always seem to rear their ugly head.
1 my father, the pathetic loser he is, thinks that he can get my brother a job, becuase he ""knows the head of the iron union"" which is funny, because he doesnt work and only associates with disgusting coke addicts
2 i former friend from my past, with whom ive my ups and downs with, and who i thought i had become once again on a not hating ground has started spreading rumors to other people i know about my brother based on incident that someone had made up 5 years ago, and is not telling people it really happened - what a fuck up, he doesnt know what he jsut got himself into . . . 
Why people always try to get into the buisness of people who do not wish to associate with them is unknown to me - watever, its not like they really matter to me."

"event","So yesterday, i got back from the dells, where i stayted for spring break. Man the off-season blows - everything closed down at like 5. But given the free time we decided to skinny dip and make prank calls. It was great. Getting caught by some middle aged dad was the best because he was staying on our floor and we were constantly running into him. He tried to act like he didnt see our tits. it was funcking hillarious.

So tonight, hopefully, im gonna go get my first tattoo. I want to get a strawberry on my back with the leaves turing into fire. for 2 reasons:

1. The strawberry is symbolic of my childhood
2. The tattoo is symbolic of my childhood going up in flames, but never really buring away

So i took some quizes today from that shescrafty website I am Deb from Tower Records, Ferris for what 80s movie star am i, and i would infact survive if i was in a slasher movie, but barely. Its interesting stuff, good to know.

I need a job, it sucks . . . my babysitting and getting high school credit thing fell through. its lame.

I love sex."

Day Of Silence April 21st Yay!

I love fun stuff, im in a verry happy mood, since theres no school for a week, and im gonna do fun stuff with fun friends, as opposed to have a lame break at home. Having a car, while a pain in the but, and $ consuming is soo fun. I love to drive really fast with really loud music while singing at the top of my lungs. I get to feel silly, and like a rock-star, ha, and hyper without people commenting. Latly, i havent been able to stop smiling, and all my friends are noticing it too. Good luck Karla - just stick to the plan *wink wink* 

Go spring break - even the weather is feeling alot warmer. I cant wait until this summer when i can swim until i drop. I love it when its hot out, ar at least youe body is hot, and you get that exhillarated feeling when you enter cold water. I cant wait until summer now. Nut anyways in Indiana theres this water park in santa clause indiana, and it looks like alot of fun. Weeeeeee Water Slides!!!!!!!!! And driving with all the windows down without get your seat soaking wet (i had a puddle in my seat on wed morning)!!!!!!!!!! Yay 2story candy store in the dells!"

"event","I went to a catholic school for 11 years
it was preschool through 9th grade for me
we learned:
about why we should love jesus, 
the wickedness of pre-marital sex, 
and how to devote our lives to ""the lord""

I now or have:
stopped loving or caring about jesus
engage in premarital sex (well not lately, but i have)
told my religion teacher that catholisism was full of it

To put it bluntly i think its funny that people go around ready fairy tales and devoting their lives to a man who wasnt born from a virgin. she was married people, it had to be consummated before the other family would give up the dowery. Anyways i dont consider myself an athiest. I have faith, and belifs, i just find the whole idea of god so unintellegent - i mean people would make up these stories to explain things and make sense to them. I think the bible and its teachings, and the church full of contradictions, here are a few:

It is unholy to get peircings, tattoos, and use drugs, it is unnessacary to your body (which as we all know is ""gods temple"")
however, churches have stained glass and burn hundred of candles, as well as nail things to the walls . . . makes you think

i have more, but i dont feel like being rightious right now"

"event","Punk rock, it changed my life. It changed who I wanted myself to be. It inspired me, and filled me hate at the same time. It made me think about life and choices. I wanted to change the world before, now i want to change parts of the world. Slow evolution is better then combustable revolution.

    ""3-String Passion""

Punk Rock
Rockin before shit hit the fan
before the music went to the man
was all about chance
standing up and taking a stace
Spewind words of fire
On thinkgs censored, taboo and dire
It was the music, the mind the spirt
it was within you if you were strong enough to bear it


Beacuse ""punk"" was such a large part of my life i will never deny who i was and who i am. Modified now, i think it has taught so many people so much. 



Thanks Mr. Cantore for telling us what real punk is."

"event","Well, here I am jumping on the band wagon . . . im still not sure why . . . 

here's a few words to the wise:

    - i'm a terrible typer, and you may see mispelled words often
    - capitals aren't always important
    - i feel like a big dork right now, and can't think of anything else for this list

well, there you go

perhaps i will write more later on."

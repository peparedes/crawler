the only reason i am on this right now is because there is nothing better that i could do in Fairfield at Ruben's house but go and write about what i have done this summer. sort of like the assignments that our teachers would give us on our first day back to school. But i'm lazy so instead of an essay, i will present a very clear list. 
And i don't even have to worry about anyone reading it. 
let's see, the list begins like this:
--finding new home
--working at the library
--drugs
--meeting peter
--tattoo
--drinking
--drugs
--heat
--spending lots of money
--new music
and i hope everyone is having a splendid summer. i will talk to you when i talk to you."

"event","So i'm having a scary thought today and that thought is, what should I do.

I like my life right now just as it is and I want it to stay this way but the problem is that in the next month I am going to have to find a new house, be on a new course and be packing up to go home for a month. 
I don't really like how life pushes us when we aren't ready, sometimes I feel like everything is moving way too fast for me. I mean maybe it's me, that I just let time pass by and I don't think about it and I don't  make the developments I should have but I did but now as the school year is ending i'm doubting that I made the right choices. 
I love physiology/biology but i'm going to do a media course next year. I wanted to do that when i signed up for it, when I put in all that effort during the interview and that but now i don't know. do i find it all to self-gratifying. do i want to spend the rest of my life doing something which makes me feel good but in reality doesn't help anyone?
i'm getting frustrated with my inconsistentcy.
i looked at universitys the other day and I realized that I don't want to move away and start something new. I just started something new 10 months ago and I like it and I want things to stay as they are.
I'm always fighting change and I hate that I miss people at home and I don't want to feel like I'm chosing between places and people but I do. I miss my dad, i get scared that he is getting older and what if he gets sick or dies, i love him more than anyone and I want to be near him but I also want to stay here and be near my family here. 
i don't know what to do. 
I feel like anything i do is inevitable loss and I hate that. 
i've got a lot of growing up to do but honestly i think problem number one is that I don't have priorities and I haven't assessed the value of all the different things in my life.
or maybe I have and everything matters and I don't want to lose anything.

and sometimes i fantasize about being a doctor and joining that doctors wihtout borders thing. that would ake me even more lost but i still kind of want to. or i want to be an environmantal scientist and figure out this global warming shit and pollution and destruction but how do i do that and am i even smart enough?
i guess i just feel like I have my own dreams of doing different things but part of what makes me complete as a person is everyone i know and love and the times that we spend together and I feel like I'm being forced to make a choice between the two and i really don't like it."

"event","I've got my last exam next monday, it already feels like summer tho. I kinda want to go to the beach but it's starting to cool down now.
so i got deathly ill on monday night. I was 20 mins late for my chem exam today because I've been in a coma since tuesday afternoon. I got some blood boiling disease. I'm feeling better today, just got a sore throat and runny nose but I'm okay.
I had my bio exam on monday and it was okay. I'm hoping to get a C on the exam which would give me a B in bio but if I got a D, which I really hope I didn't then I'll probably get a C in bio.
I went out for some celebratory drinks with jenny and jason and that was fun.  adam came and met us afterwards. then we went to the pressure point and I saw russell, and he looked hella good, he buzzed his hair and it's really nice. He has such a nice neck, i couldn't stop kissing it. 
Donno what to do, i hope i get a lot of hours at work next week otherwise I'm going to be bored, what the hell do you do when you have no class? 
I just want to eat cookies right now because I can't think of anything else I'd enjoy doing."

"event","I could go into it but I don't really feel like it. I'm sad and confused which is pretty much how i feel everytime i get rejected. 
I've learned never to underestimate the power of someone you don't really like to hurt you. I don't even understand it myself really. I think it's just the shock that's killing me. also the fact that I was just starting to open up to the idea of trusting him, silly me. As if I haven't learned that lesson enough.
brace me, i've just taken another blow to the ego. 
Lucky me and I get one tomorrow too, right as I have my bio exam. 
Wish me luck!!!

"event","How many times have I lied to myself? many many.
I guess what it really comes down to is that I choose not to see the truth because I can't handle what it means for me. I saw it yesterday and I got so fucking depressed I practically wanted to kill myself. Sometimes I feel so alone. 

I guess it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. I just have to keep telling myself that each day is a chance to make things better but if I don't take that chance, if I don't make the effort then it's a waste.

Today I made some progress. I worked hard. I let the truth out.
I saw the clouds flicker the sunlight on the table over my book and I nearly felt sick. I read 50 things which I don't know if I believe, show me. I trusted someone when they proved their trust to me. I accepted a shitty thing and forgave, I accepted a second shitty thing and let it go, let it all go. 
I made a promise which I promptly broke but not to be mean, only because of my own security. I made a mental decision which makes the broken promise so much more important.
Apathy is easy. 
Difficulty gives it so much more value.

I need to clean and I hope there is still time to redeem myself.
I have done the wrong thing, wanted the wrong things but I hope I will always know what I know right now.

I promised you I'd never give up."

"event","I'm kinda stressed out. I just went to the bank. I realized that I'm going to be pretty fucking poor for the next two months.
I'm glad I've got a job at the office. I do need more hours but I'm sure I will get them once i'm properly trained.

I had a weird day yesterday. I've been feeling really spaced out since the weekend, from smoking. it makes me retarded. I was stressing out about my math exam. I might not take it. I know I'm going to fail. I should really just focus on my chem and bio. I'm doing better in chemistry. i may pass. 
I'm going to be shopping reduced for a couple of weeks. I need to quit smoking because I can't afford it. or start smoking rollies. but i can't roll for shit so nvm.
I studied so much yesterday. it got me no where tho. I think my chemistry teacher hates me. except i think he does like me. i donno. It was really pathetic because there were only 8 people in our class yesterday. It used to have about 26 ppl in it.
I brought adam home and made him and my aunt dinner because he was feeling down. Life crisis. what to do. who knows? does anyone? we never really know whats going to happen.
after we went to the office, had one drink and then he left and I stayed for a staff meeting. I'm not the only one having financial problems. I feel really bad for my manager because she always has to pay when the cashiers are short.  The meeting was interesting. I'm learning about drinks. I think it's pretty cool.  the people i work with are pretty funny. the manager and ast. manager are cool. 
I came home after and felt like really tired. I started cleaning. I cleaned until like 20 mins before russell came over. I laid down for one second and I almost fell asleep. 
it was great when he came over. we almost had sex in the doorway. I was dying to see him. I don't know how I go from cold to hot so quick. I was about to tell him I didn't want to see him anymore on monday-day and then monday night I was saying the dirtiest things to him. now I'm all cool. I do like him. I'm just not completely sure yet. I'm never sure. so far so good tho.
I haven't seen jason. It's a good thing. I got over him for a while when I didn't see him. I'll get over him again. If I don't see him, I don't see what I'm missing and I'm hoping that I will just stop caring. I still think about calling him. it's stupid. I think I should just delete his number from my phone. Its existence is a hazard when I'm drunk.
I just had some really good chicken and pasta. I want some more. It was cheap too. everything has to be cheap from now on. 
I have to pay rent today. ugh. 13 pounds for the next 10 days. can i do it? 
hmm i'm so sexually satisfied right now. hell yeah, thats good. life is good. some things are confusing and shitty but my life is good.
i better go revise now. I've been fucking around too much today.
hope all is well in the worlds of my friends at home, wish i knew."

the last time i wrote was the end of april but a few things have happened since then.
I got a job last night at the pub that I was drinking at. pretty cool.
i had sex with russell, wait I started dating russell first off, then we had sex. i'm not really sure how i feel. he already mentions ""us"" and i just, just no. oh yeah but it was my first full and complete orgasm so hell yeah. still not sure. he's rushing things too much. i think he likes me A LOT more than i like him. probs cuz i dont even kno if i really like him. hmmm whatever.
on thursday night i drunk dialed jason. well done me. got some kind of closure. except i thought closure wasn't supposed to include me basically saying i still want you and why wont u fuck me and u wont hurt me like you hurt your ex and why can't we just go back to the way things were before. 
some closure. i'm an idiot.
i'm relationship retarded which is too bad for russell because I'm not getting involved with him. i'm just going to hurt him and i don't want that. he's a good guy, but he's not right for me and i really should cut it off asap.
there was some other stuff to say but i gotta go eat.
and i had my interview for my media course and i think it went well. i hope it went well.
thats all. i'm gonna go peel some potatoes now."

"event","Well the moment has come when my health can no longer stand to live in the dorms and I am required to move home for the remainder of the semester. Once again I have cysts, this time in my labia. Fun huh? There were three that swelled up and made it so uncomfortable for me to walk, stand and even lie down and sleep. This all happend wednesday and I called the doctors to see if I could be seen then, but they told me Thursday in the morning was the only time they could fit me in. So after a sleepless night I was to be seen by the gynocologist, at this point the cysts are bleeding heavily and make it almost impossible for me to walk. As I was sitting with the other pristine ladies I was in my bob marley sweatshirt with my legs apart praying they were going to see me soon. The doctor looked at me like god you poor girl, you have had such a bad month. For all those counting this the 2nd surgery in 5 weeks, the fun continues. So the doctor explained to me that I was going to have surgery and have to take a ton of baths. Now I live in a dormitory, baths are non-existent, not to mention they would be disgusting if we had them. I asked her if I could have an iv because my last surgery was very painful. She laughed told me I was cute and told me they didn't do that at her clinic. So I was given 2 extra strength vicodin and told to come back in 2 hours when the pain medicine would kick in at full force. Sarah came to my rescue and drove to hold my hand through the procedure. The post-operation was much less painful then the last time which was a huge relief. But Sarah took me home to have some nice warm baths and be taken care of. I was so fed up at this point, I was like can't I just do independent study again? Well funny thing is, I really can. I had my mommy call the Dean of Students, and I spoke with her as well as the associate dean and the health services nurse and they approved me finishing the remainder of the semester at home. This means I get full credit and grades but I write my papers and take my tests and such from home. I actually only have papers and one test which is nice. This is the benefit of a small school, being able to these kinds of things. However I am so sad to be leaving my friends. Yesterday I was walking up the stairs with Mark and hes like keep it together, cause he knew I was on the verge of tears. Things like that are hard to find, people who know you so well they know when you are about to cry. Gosh I never thought I would be missing this place, but I really am. As far as coming back next year it is still up in the air, but I will still register for classes this week. I already have my dorm room and stuff, maybe another semester, but I am not thinking for spring. Either studying abroad, transfering, or whatever. I am relieved to go home though, I will get good sleep, the proper care and being in beautiful NorCal. Plus it will give me a chance to know who i am and form a conclusion about the year. There are some things this year that have been to crazy for words, some things I would take back and some things that I wouldn't change for a minute. I miss you guys but I realize there are a lot of things that I can do on my own now that I couldn't do before so I am proud. Love you all and see you back in san francisco baby!"

"event","Well my life is getting back to normal after being home. I'm happier. I'm saner. I'm more focused. I feel friggin good. 
I had a big blow today at college. the fact is that I'm probably going to do very poorly on my chem exam. I am going to study hardest for math and bio because at least I know I am capable doing well. I just don't know my stuff in chem and I probably won't ever, there is just too much to memorize and my brain doesn't work like that.  I've got about six weeks until my exams so I better get crackin.
I had a hella fun weekend. One of the best that I've had in a while. There would be too much to explain but it was a great weekend.
I'm going out with this guy tomorrow that I met a couple months back. He is pretty nice. Problem is that I'm not really sure what I want right now, nothing serious, that's for sure. ... wait yes I know what I want but it's not working right now so i'm moving on. I waste too much of my life looking for answers that I can't have and waiting on people who don't care, I'm over it. 
I spent most of the day at college  but I went to wetherspoons with a couple of friends afterwards and had a really good time. We were having a very... um, the only way I can think to describe the conversation was the greatest expansion of conciousness that you can ever imagine. seriously I don't need drugs, my mind is pretty fucking cool. I'm glad I am capable of seeing so far out of the box. Although at one point we were talking about fight club and I got a little paranoid. 
I had this realization today that I'm really happy with my friends here. They are really cool. I can talk to them about crazy shit and they know what I'm talking about. I still miss my friends at home but it's nice to be able to find people on the otherside of the world who get me too. 
I signed up for my course next year. I talked to the tutor and she is bumping me up a year. pretty fucking cool. she said she thinks I am too smart for the first year course. I don't know how much of a compliment it was since she made the course sound really basic but still, she just saved me a year of my life. well I don't know. I don't really know what the plan is, but I'm cool right now, I don't need a big one. I'm happy to just explore right now. I have faith, things will work out and if they don't then I'll figure something out. shiat I don't know but I'm not going to take life too seriously, I'm going to give myself an ulcer or some shit if i think too much.  I went to the natural history museum with gen, this is all I have to say: time is infinite, all you can do is explore and enjoy. ponder the answers but don't get lost in the questions and remember that the dandelions count. 
I'm glad I realized that. my life is better now.
one of the things that I realized from my conversation with gennie about nima is that we all need a personal philosophy and I think I finally have mine. It's so unfair, we all need someone to talk to us when we get ourselves in a headfuck and I think i'm lucky, because I found someone and he didn't but wish so much he had. life is so wonderous, we shouldn't ever let that escape us."

ummm guess who i saw last night?
euh yep jason. o lord somebody needs to help me because I'm going to implode if I don't ever get to have sex with him. I'm going to be on my death bed thinking that all I ever wanted in life was to have amazing sex with him.
okay obviously not really but he cut his hair and I wanted to fuck him so much last night I thought I was going to collapse on the floor. I don't even know what that means but thats how i felt. i could probably go into a lot of detail about what i felt last night but i'll spare you all. and I'll spare you the details as to where my imagination wandered before I went to sleep last night. gen was in the room so don't worry I wasn't masterbating or anything. haha. 
oh yeah, gennie is staying with me for the weekend before she goes to NY. pretty cool. we are going to have a crazy night tonight i hope. but no cocaine. no drugs except alcohol. i need to stop destroying my brain. drugs are bad kids, don't do them. okay I'm still crazy from sleep deprivation.

SHIT i woke up at 4:30 again. I'm going to die if I don't  sleep soon. I haven't had more than 5 1/2 hours sleep in three days and I'm so fucking tired. honestly I feel like i've been doing speed and coke and my brain is just running out of control. i'm thinking about nothing important but i just can't stop thinking. i'm having imaginary conversations with elisa. i'm insane. well not really imaginary because she isn't talking back to me but I'm thinking of all this shit to tell her and trying to decide what to do this summer and on monday and agh, i wish my brain would turn off.
I'm going to try to go back to sleep again even tho it's 9am. wish me luck.

omigod i fucking need to get laid. ahhh i haven't had sex in so long (for me)!!!!!!

Anyway, in other news i am still flemmy. yes there is flem in my throat. anyone want to get it out for me?? I'll give you an air hug from florida. 
I had a revelation last night, or rather this morning,at 1:30 : I can be happy if I stop worrying; if i stop caring. It's like this huge weight is lifted off my shoulder. amazing. After eighteen years and finally i am starting to discover the freedom of ""hippy state of mind"". 
Yeah, you probably have no idea what i am talking about.
I made cream of wheat this afternoon(when i woke up) and it was far too soupy. that upset me, but then i went upstairs and watched ""passions"" and i laughed at the stupid people on t.v. which made me feel better.

happy birthday me.
I kind of feel 20 and not 19 but it's all cool.
I'm happy to be home and see some people. I'm sad I didn't get to see pete and sam tho.
oh yeah and my sister is crazy. more so than i think i ever realized while i lived here.
I can't even explain how mad it is to come home with a different perspective and see some people.  My head has been on the brink of exploding for about four days.
I didn't realize it was possible to get culture shock upon returning home but it definitely is.

I have a dentist appointment at 12:30 and then I go to santa cruz with C & E & N & me
this doesn't feel like a birthday at all.
no one even called me to say happy birthday.
not even my mom.
i should just fuckin kill myself or something.
whatever i'll just get really drunk tonight and then make sure I don't call anyone on THEIR birthdays.

oh yeah and I had a really weird dream last night that I went over to someone's house and mr zailian and carrie and orlando were there and carrie was a coke head, and we went swimming and i got a crazy letter from my mom and orlando was sexy some more and then i threw a bitchin house party and got in a fight with some old lady about smoking in the house. 

I miss something
not sure what it is.

Also I have laryngitis. and its raining.

"event","so you can take that cookie and stick it up your ass.
I honestly don't know why I am listneing to angry limp bizkit breakup music.
Basically I'm leaving in one day, so that means that I have to get super trashed tonight. hmmm, i'll be checking my bank account before that happens tho because otherwise I could have some serious troubles in getting to the airport. I'm thinking of just getting adam and heather to come over and buying cheap beer at the offy and getting trashed at my place.
so whats up with hi5 recently? I forgot about that shit for hella long but for some reason lately i got like 10 messages and shit. i guess it finally took off, it's the new myspace except way shittier.
So I was right about me pmsing. got that bitch last night when i wasn't expecting it. I was kinda hoping to get laid before i left but whatever it's all cool. at least I know I'm not pregnant, not that I would be because I haven't had sex in forever and a half, gross exaggeration, it hasnt even been two months but i donno, that's just a month and a half too long for me.
I still fantasize about adam. i know he's an idiot but man, sometimes the sex really is enough. In fact I'd say sex is the number 1 reason why I've gotten involved with about 90% of the guys I've hooked up with. I'm not going to try to think of an exception cuz I don't know if I can. In the end that's somehow what it always depended on.
ahhhh my feet are freezing. 
fuck I don't just want to hang around my house. I need to get out. It was sunny but now it's looking like it might rain in about an hour. 
oh good news, sam finally stopped calling, i think. I'm a bitch for ignoring him but I just couldn't talk to him, I thought if I heard him call me baby one more time that I might explode with disgust. I know it was bitchy and spineless of me and I fucking hate it when people do that but I just couldn't talk to that guy, he is used to getting what he wants and people like that are assholes when you say no to them.  Silence always means its over, even if it was only a friendship, we all know that. sometimes I pretend that I don't know that, just becuase I fuckin hate rejection. 
God i was in kind of a bitch mood today. Mostly because there is the most fucking annoying guy in my math class. I just really wanted to yell at him. but then not because it's not nice. I know he means well but he's just such a moron it drives everyone to the brink of insanity. nic is the only one with enough balls to say anything to him. she can be real mean tho. I'm pretty sure she said something about prostitutes not deserving to live the other day. I bet she would have sex for a million pounds tho, even if it was with someone foul. most people would. I mean come on, it lasts 40 minutes max and the rest of your life would be fucking taken care of. It's totally worth it. In fact I'm kind of wishing someone would offer me that. damn.
speaking of that I got offered a booty call from this pretty sexy guy. I'm not going to take him up on it. I'm not really down with that. first off because they are always a little bit, i donno, sleazy. you have to fake that you are getting into making out with them even though you don't give a shit and i'd rather have sex with someone i actually like even if that person is not currently in my life. and at the end you always feel like you kind of like them even though you don't, your emotions are just trying to rationalize what you've just done. they are unfulfilling. period. and most of the time it ends up sucking and you leave more frustrated than you came, or rather didn't come. haha. 
i bet no one read this whole thing. I think i just write for my own entertainment actually. good solution to boredom and procrastination is updating.
ahh its so cold now, come back sun.
hmm i think i;m just going to stay up all wednesday night and drink and then sleep on the plane. i can't ever seem to sleep on planes. i hate that. 
oh yeah and i think my dad got pissed at me cuz i asked him to get greg to buy me a bottle of vodka. hey man, its my birthday. buy me some fuckin champagne, no wait, asti baby.
mmm it's my brithday sooon wooohhooooooo. yes i love it.
okay peace out, i'm going to try to go convince someone to go drink with me. if i have money that is... ugh fuck brokeness.
I LOVE YOU ALL AND I""LL SEE YOU SOON!!!

SAM SAM SAM i forgot to tell u that I'm going to see my mom too so I actually wont see u until prob the 14th but hell yeah i'm coming to sf. oh damn I kind of forgot that i have to stay in MV when i come home. damn it. 
whatever it's my brithday soon, everything is all good."

Jesus christ,peter.Are you even still a virgin. you need to call me and tell me everything. Secondly,I hope the whole speed and coke thing is a joke because that seems out of character for you elisa. ESpecially how you and cec reacted to me doing it back in high school that one time. 
I miss you christina. i miss everyone, but i wish i could talk to you chris. Are you coming home soon? are you really going to drop out of college? Fuck i'm so out of the loop. call me people.I know it's hard to stay in touch, but....
I have been doing pretty o.k.here in the city. I had been going out with Carlos occassionaly. All the time being obsessed with him.Then I finally made the move and kissed him and he kissed me back. When i found out he liked me the whole time i liked him (that would be a year,kids) i choked.I couldn't believe it.But what happens next? i loose all interest. And for a second in my life I actually thought i loved him.I know, stupid, but don't laugh. I don't know what happened, except that maybe i just built it up too much in my head. 
I am going to Florida on thursday for spring break. i hate Florida, but Ruben just moved there and offered me  to come stay with him.I just need some sun, because it is fucking gloomy and rainy here. 
I am moving to Mission and Valencia in June with a roomate of my'n and her friend. I can't wait, because i love that area. mexican food, thrift shops,and pretty ""samantha"" boys. 
I don't know what else is new,except that i realize my friends at school are stupid and i stopped hanging out with them. I hang out alot withmy roommates and co-workers.haha.i like it a lot more. Oh yeah, i am working at the library on campus now.
Sorry for the longblog, and i wonder if anyone actually read the whole damn thing.

Here's an update on christina's life:
completely broke
kinda depressed
kinda lonely
really ready to come home (ehh but not to face pissed off father)
sick
doing okay in coll
non-existent lovelife, and apathetic about it

Basically I spent my last 10 pounds yesterday on food, except I seem to currently have no food except milk and cereal so I did a bad job of spending the last of the money. 
Then I asked my dad for some money and he basically got really pissed off. He told me I was financially irresponsible and that I would be working at phat burgers when i come home. phat fuckin chance. I'll kill myself if I ever have to work there again. serisously I'm not kidding, I would kill myself. actually I'm kind of thinking about it anyways right now. I don't know why. acutally i think I'm going to start bleeding soon and that's why I'm feeling down. Is it normal to get suicidal during PMS because that always seems to happen to me. 
it was really funny to read peters entry because that's what i felt for a while like a month ago. Now I feel lonely and confused. It's like I know i'm a commitment-phobe and i know I only actually like guys that are like me, which means they are commitment-phobes and I know that it leads to bad outcomes but I can't get out of the cycle because every other guy irritates me.
And even the guys that I ""like"", I don't really. adam bugged the shit out of me. he, like matt, was uncreative and uninteresting to talk to, all he cared about was drugs and clothes/shopping.  then jason, god, someone please fucking slap me. You know how it's so easy to idealize something after its over. seriously i think i did that. i re-read something from those weeks and it was like: i'm freaked out by his last relationship and I feel too pressured and I don't know what to do and I think i want out. then it was, i think he's an indecisive -blank-.... but basically I did like him but i just didnt want to have sex and/or didn't trust him. i have trust issues. anyways I know I'm supposed to be doing my essay but chris just called me and asked me to go for a pint with him, which i have every intention of doing.

"event","So I finally stopped forgetting or procrastinating to find out the password to this blogsite! Yay. I just got back from spring break, where I spent a week in West Virginia, staying in a battered women and children's shelter with a Cornell community service program. It was really fun, and the girls( the trip was five girls and me hahaha yeah, i know, perfect) and i really bonded with some of the women and the kids were so goddamn cute. One girl wrote an essay for us on one of the volunteer's laptops, and she spent a lot of time typing it up and mumbling to herself while typing and turning around to ask us how to spell something. And when she finally finished she walked over and read it to us. She's 7 and it was the cutest goddamn thing I have ever read. My favorite line: ""I love the Cornell students here. They are absolutely going to Heaven, the kingdom of God."" Hahaha seriously that is classic.

I ate junk food for six straight days and I think that I actually gained weight for maybe the first time in my life in such a short amount of time. It kind of sucks because I feel like I can feel the grease and fat just sitting in my stomach, and squeezing through my pores, and circulating throughout my disgusting body. Ew seriously all I want is a goddamn fruit salad.

Anyways, so right before spring break, I broke up with Matt, the guy I'd been dating for three months, for a variety of reasons. The most important ones are that he is a horrible conversationalist and doesn't willingly share things. Seriously, I had to fucking probe him and ask about a thousand questions just to get him to tell me about his life. It's not that he's shy or nervous. He's just uncreative and quiet. I can't handle that. I realized that I can't be with someone who is so...indifferent about life. Everything with him is just blah. He never seems happy or angry or sad. Just always peaceful and simple. I want someone more like me in that they can be ecstatic, and bitchy, and lonely, and curious, and passionate, and enraged within a matter of minutes. Or at least someone who surprises me and keeps me interested. So yeah, I broke up with him, and the break-up actually went great. I just told him that since I've been so busy with homework and everything I don't think I have time to really invest in a meaningful relationship, and that combined with the fact that we're living together next year made me realize that we should try being friends and stop dating. He took it incredibly well.

I'm not worried about living with him because we're friends right now, and we hang out, and it's not awkward or weird. I just hope that I don't drunkenly try to hook up with him. I have to discipline myself to not let my desperation get the best of me.

I'M SINGLE! YEAAHH!!! And seriously I feel so asexual. Masturbation is fine with me at the moment. I'm not really pursuing anyone or worrying about finding someone. I know that something meaningful will come eventually and I should just let it find me instead of being obsessed with the idea of a perfect relationship that it ruins any chances of one because it causes me to overanalyze everything. Seriously I'm realizing that you can't depend on someone else to make you happy and complete. Obviously falling in love is going to be wonderful but I just need to chill and find a sense of meaning and worth within myself and not within other guys. Sometimes being single is so nice. Not having to worry about what this person thinks  about you and how you present yourself and if you're doing enough/too much/too little for them and for yourself. I'm sick of all the psychological bullshit that comes with searching for a meaningful relationship, and I'll just let it come when it comes. Till then, as Beyonce sings, ""Me, myself, and I. That's all I got in the end. That's what I found out. And there 'aint no need to cry. I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend."""

the funniest thing I said on tuesday was ""I eat lemons, smoke and drink shitloads of coffee and I still have better teeth than you.""
on monday i saw some woman stop and ask another woman if she was okay because she was crying hysterically in her car. I was sad about the woman crying but the situation restored my faith in humanity.
I just had a staring contest with a cat and lost, just barely , then I started to laugh at myself because I am the most ridiculous person alive, then i felt like a weirdo because I was laughing by myself on my deck. the funny thing is that i should have felt weird for entertaining a staring contest with a cat. I love cats, they are my favorite.
I thought nag champa incense was called chumbawumba the other day.
I saw something really funny on the simpsons the other day. marge hardly says anything funny but what she said was really funny. 
I dream of saxophone and jazzman by carol king.
I have consumed way to much coffee today and I think its making me a little crazy.

Well I'm staying home tonight and babysitting, so I'm hopefully going to get some work done because morgan is asleep. I got my exam results on thrusday and they were really bad. I mean like E and no mark. I was actually surprised I managed to get an E on the maths exam because I didn't really study, I mostly studied for bio, which I almost can't even really call studying because I studied a little bit for about a week. It was basically a big kick in the ass and I really do need to get myself together and start focusing on school. I kind of started laughing when I read them, because I thought I might cry kind of, except I really didn't want to because I was in the lift with adam and jason and I just couldn't do that, way too uncomfortable. Friday was okay though. I went home on thrusday and I was kind of depressed for about half an hour and then i sat down and started doing work until like 11:30 at night, so that made me feel a little better. I couldn't sleep for a long time because I was scared I was going to have sleep paralysis again. I knew it was going to happen. I didn't go to sleep until like 2:30 and I didn't get it. I just got really fuckin tired for the next day. I felt like my head was going to explode by the end of the day on friday. I was pretty focused the whole day. heather cracks me up, we were having some pretty intense scientific questioning yesterday which was hella funny/interesting because it was kind of wondering and then making up our own theories. Like about why black absorbs more heat than white, how does that happen at an atomic level. I kind of talked about the idea of it not so much being individual atoms but the structure, like white must have some sort of crystal structure that reflects the light but I really don't have a clue. google time.
I should really be doing my bio work but I'm going to go on one of my curious tangents now. 
oh yeah and I met a hot guy last night but he was an idiot. pretty much end of story. 
My aunt left today so I've got the house to myself until I go home. I'm not really happy about that. This house can be really lonely and creepy sometimes. I don't ever want to live alone I don't think. I'll be babysitting a lot too while she is gone, so I probably wont get too lonely. hey and I can have sex in the house now. right... except not because I'm a singleton again. I'm over one night stands I think. Adam kind of ruined them for me. jesus. I don't even know what I want but I really don't feel like getting into it. 
also I tanned a little bit today. It wasn't deathly cold and it was sunny so I put on my bikini top and got some rays. hella freckles came back and I realized that I was probably the only nutter in brighton trying to get a tan this afternoon. I just miss the sun so much."

"event","I made the past entry private cause I am a paranoid fuck. Anyways a lot has changed in the past few weeks, I have made some close girl friends. I am constantly partying and having fun, but some part of me is lacking. I still have my boys always to lean on, and let me tell you if I didn't have them this year I wouldnt have made it this long. I am seriously thinking of going home and attending USF, if it doesnt work out for the fall then I will hopefully go there in the spring, or an entirely different school. I may be in New York in the spring, who knows. All I know is that this isn't the place for me. I told Mark and Paul and they were really upset. Paul was like I wish you would stay but I mean you have your mind set. Mark said he didn't support it, cause he thinks I am not going to go back to school and I will just live with my parents. So I dunno maybe that could happen, living with the parents, working, and go to COM if I dont get into USF. Wow living with the parents again, never really thought that would happen but I dunno every scenario has its drawbacks and I dont think that this one would be as negative as living and going to whittier. There are way too many fucked up people that are not supportive and in fact are the cruelest people I have ever met. I have friends who attempted to be in Societies which is my schools versions of sororities, and now are trying to fuck with my friend lauren who depledged because they fucked with her so hard during pledging and was hospitalized. Now they are coming back and are trying to make her life miserable. This world is so fucked up sometimes and it is pretty incredible the amount of things that we keep up with. Mark and Paul were talking about how girls just talk so much shit, and I guess that is true. Part of the reason I have never really been angry at either of those boys is because we say exactly what is on our minds every day and take light in a lot more situations then girls do. I suppose that is why feminism never really worked out, women are way to competitive with eachother, a girl in my women in politics class said it best how can we ever get a female candidate for president if she is worried if her butt will look too big while she is reciting her speech. It is a pretty interesting phenomenon, women are so doubtful of themselves that they forget they ever could perform such tasks like running for office. I am rambling I know, but I just thought it was something that needed to be said and thought about by whomever reads this blog. It is time for me to come home. Los Angeles is one dirty city, and I miss the beautiful air of home. I need to work on getting myself finished through the remainder of the semester and then I need to get home where I belong. too many things have gone on here, maybe I am coping out, maybe I am scared but you know what I am admitting that and I am returning home because that is the healthiest thing I can do for myself at this point. I miss my parents, they are the two of the most intelligent people I have ever met. They have dealt with some pretty horrible things this year, and they continue to support me in whatever I do all the time. I love them with all of my heart. See you kids in 13 days, I cant wait."

"event","everyone has given up on the blog. so much for not losing contact. its kinda depressing me. 
I'm coming home soon. 15 days. I've already packed the things that I'm taking home and leaving there. I'm scared. I don't know what it's going to be like to come home. I know I've changed I'm just not sure how much yet. so what if I come home and have a freak out? I guess I've had this thing kind of building up in me. this feeling of being all vagabond-ish. Like I'm not really sure where my home is anymore. I'm pretty much adjusted now. It's good. It took me a while but I don't know if it's really fair to say that I'm not very adaptable. I mean it's big thing doing what I did. I walked into a situation when I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into. 
look, it's like I've gotten myself into this place, it's a psychological place now, it's this place where I can't go back to the way i used to be, to what i used to know as normal. I've gotta move forward but I'm so unsure about where that forward place is.  I know I'm all agog to see the world and to enjoy my life and that's about it. It reminds me of that night pablo said laura was a lost soul. I got mad at him, and I said she was looking for something. She's a searching soul, and I know because I'm one too. I just admitted that I believe in souls. It's a damn lonesome kind of soul to be.  Sometimes I want pure true love and stablity and a direction but at the same time I can't think of anything more chaining and scary. 

I remember when I was in a good happy place. I remember wanting to stay there forever and feeling like I was home. I was so damn nervous though. too damn nervous about what all those feelings meant for my future. I didn't like the pressure and I selfdestructed. You can't really hide who you are and you can't change when you're someone like I am. I am always going to have this wild spirit. It means something for me. It means that sometimes I'm going to belonely as hell, it means that sometimes I am going to disappoint those I love and cause masses of frustration for my parents, it means that I'm going to face endless criticism. It means that one day, I'm probably going to have a lot of regrets and no answer to soothe them. 
I'll probably spend a lot of time with common people. I'll probably read a lot of books that will make me think and maybe long for something more. I'll probably have a lot of jobs that I hate and know a lot of people that I love and a lot of loves that i lost. I'll probably have a hundred sleepless nights. I'll probably see thousands of beautiful things. I might feel bad about myself a lot. I might feel invincible a lot. I might lose faith a lot. I will probably say some things that I don't mean and have emotions that I don't understand. I'll probably dance and drink too much. I will probably work too hard sometimes and get exhausted. I probably won't feel old when I am, just over experienced. 
I want to learn how to play the piano. I want to know when and how to say goodbye. I want to know when to care and when to know that it's not worth caring about. I want to stay beautiful even if I get hurt. I don't want to let my hurt destroy my faith in people. I want to love myself for fear that everyone who really does won't be around. I want to have a storage of happy for everytime i get sad.

When I smile at someone here, they give me a weird look or they start being creepy. Sometimes I laugh when I'm walking around, just b/c i'm remembering something. I've been watching money come and go and relationships get stronger or break apart or fade away. I've been seeing wrong reasons and bad actions. I've been seeing a lot of plastic and feeling a lot of real pain. I've been really living and having a lot of breathstopping laughter. 
I don't really know what I'm trying to say, especially because I don't know who, if anyone, is reading this, but I am getting to know myself and I'm having one of those days when the picture is clear, even though it's face down."

"event","hmmm i'm listening to jazz. don't ask me why. I'm having a weird day. I'm wearing my snowboarding pants because I'm cold. I was reading the catcher in the rye. I'm in love with holden. i know he isn't real. too bad. too bad if he was real he'd be like 50 now or maybe older.
I'm thinking a lot lately but they are all pointless thoughts. life is kinda pointless right now. I'm not really having fun, just getting fucked up and being emotional. how is it that getting high makes me cry? In fact I should almost call it getting low. 
I'm alone in the house now. Which I'm glad of. I'm really sleep deprived and hungover and down. I don't like to be around people when I'm like this. I like to... actually I don't like to do anything when I feel like this, it kind of makes me feel like dying. not really but just, oh i donno, i can't explain it. I think I'm going to have penne and cheese for dinner. I already had a salad today and an apple so i think I've been kinda healthy. I know its five and one is apparently not supposed to eat carbs after five but i really don't give a shit. I'm sick of rules. they suck.
I was just thinking about how obsessed society is with skinny girls. I swear to god i saw the ugliest girls today. they were sickly skinny and they were wearing WAY WAY too much make up. they looked sad. actually they were smiling but they looked like a sad example of what happens when you care about superficial shit like that. what am i talking about, i dont even know. I probably looked bad today too but I didn't care. I don't really care about anyone here right now. Life feels like a load of pointless BS. 
I'm glad I'm listening to jazz now. 
I played the sax the other day. I was over at heathers house and her bf plays it. heather is so cool. and so is her bf, they are just like the nicest couple i've met here. i think they are actually happy with eachother which is really cool. love is really cool. I think I'd like some of that. the pure true kind. love is paranoid these days, paranoid and fleeting. i blame people. It's like everyone is selfish and scared and corrupted. or maybe they are corrupted and they are scared because of it and it makes them not trust and be selfish, so its acutally in the exact backasswards way from what i originally thought. 
kinda cool how that worked out. I'm thinking so much today. I kinda just want to be thoughtless. i wish that a lot actually. I'm very obsessive, has anyone else noticed how obsessive I am? i wish I didn't care so much. I wish I flowed like a small stream. maybe this jazz is getting to my head. 
I keep having imaginary conversations in my head.not the crazy kind, no worries. It's just that I'm nervous to see jason. I'm thinking of chickening out from switching classes but that isn't fair. i really liked the class we had on friday. i was tired but their teacher is so much better than ours and their classes are so much more interesting and in-depth. like we talked about viruses for about 15 minutes in the night class and we talked about them for like two hours in the day class. and we aren't done apparently. 
I actually got so into it that I started to research AIDS when I came home. I'm really interested in the consiracy theory that goes along with it. heather and I were talking about it (that convo wasn't long enough actually cuz of adams drama), like how come they don't try to take over the whole body and become some giant virus. It's like they are just these little destroyers that multiply and burst out, but where are they going. it seems like almost all other diseases have some kind of explanation. and are they living? they arent really. they cant reproduce or anything. they have to get a cell to do it for them. they are so weird. that's why i don't believe that the AIDS virus is natural. 
oh god I had the most annoying math class. I have no idea what my teacher goes on about for hours. he doesn't even care that no one understands, he just keeps on and on. 
i need to get serious with college actually. i'm not really doing it like I should be. which is really pathetic on my part. 
so i had dinner with sam last night. it was fun. we have some really good convo but i don't like him having feelings for me. it's weird. I just want to be friends with him but i don't think that's ever going to happen. in fact i think i should just stop seeing him before he loses his mind. I was a little afraid of him last night, he grabs at me and I don't like it. He is one of those guys that, I don't know how to explain it. he can just get scary sometimes. he gets crazy with me a little bit. like he might rape or kill someday. is it weird that I think that? I just get this creeped out feeling from him sometimes. and I don't like how i know his obsession is a conquering thing. he just knows he can't have me and that's why he acts like that. it's sick. most men are sick actually. 
I don't know why I attract weird guys. Am I weird? maybe I just don't want to judge people because it makes me feel snobby or something and as a result I don't tell creeps/assholes/sleazebags to fuck off like I should.
okay i think I'm going to go make m pasta now. 
I'm going to lay off everything for a while, just have a couple of sober stay in weks because I've been feeling really out of sontrol and nuts recently. I've also been feeling really lonesome and aimless. i'm glad I'm coming home soon. I need to see people who really know me. I think being in a foreign place for so long is making me go a little crazy. 
damn i just remembered i have 8 pounds in my bank account. terrible. the thing is, i have no intention of getting a job. i just dont want to work right now. I've been working pretty much for a year and a half straight and trying to focus on school and I just don't want to do both right now. I'm sick of wasting my energy on work when I hate it and putting my education is third place when really it should be first.
my normal priorities go like this: work, love/friends/family, fun, school, health
it should look like this: health, friends/family, education, fun, work, love

anyways I'm gonna go make that pasta now. 
sorry this was such a probably boring and pointless entry. I need to talk sometimes though, i can't really talk too much here."

"event","okay sorry about the coked up entry this morning at 6am. I was coming down SOOO hard. 
basically lots of things suck right now. in fact, one more sucky thing, dumb me, i just texted adam and it is confirmed, he is a prick, an even bigger one than i thought actually. I hope some girl fucks him over hardcore. i wanted to write something back, like why don't u go put some more drug holes in ur brain but there's no point really.it wouldn't even be satisfying, i'd just feel immature.  I wish I had been meaner to him. I wish I had never got involved with that fucker. agh stupid me stupid me. I mean what did I think? that he was suddenly going to have a complete change in personality because he was nice for two days, aghhhhh i'm retarded. look this is my prob. i put the nice guys through hell and the assholes through heaven and at the end of the day, everyone is a miserable cunt. and its basically all my fault. 
FUCK MY LIFE RIGHT NOW!!!!
what the shit is going on?
I am so OUT OF CONTROL. I don't even know what's going on. 
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA OMIGOD I can't believe how deluded I am, somebody please come smack me. In the past two weeks I convinced myself that adam was a tender guy who had emotional issues and thats why he did drugs. when really he is just a fucking prick, with or without the drugs, in fact the drugs only barely make him nice sometimes. but he is still a TOTAL AND COMPLETE DICKHEAD.
Okay suddenly I am just totally over it

dude can all the guys in the world just keep the fuck away from me. i hate them, i hate them all. they are all fucking pricks. i don't understand why this is but they are. and they get worse as i get older.  
what was i even getting upset over? him? that ass? am i completely retarded? 
i just want to be in a loving relationship so bad that i think i actually get into this happy deluded place. omigod my mom does that. oh nooooooo.

okay I've gotta get some studying done or whatever. I just can't believe the last two weeks. or maybe three weeks, i swear i am losing my mind.
i can't think about any of it, not anymore because I've been going crazy these past weeks and I just want to get lost in my books and yeah basically forget everyone and everything that is causing unneccessary stress."

"event","I just came home and cried in my room so hard I wished my chest would explode to let all the pain and shit out. I don't know what's going on with me. everything is so complicated. I feel alone and misunderstood or un-understood or more like no one really listens to me. I fuckin hate it. 
So i wanted to stay home tonight because I had an exhausting day and I was just at the end of my nerves/wits. I went out with my aunt for tapas. then heather called and I agreed to go meet her. it would have been fine, just chilling with her. but then she called adam. and adam had gotten in a fight with his boyfriend. and his boyfriend punched him. like bigbruise on his face punch. so heather and I tried to make him feel better but it didnt help. adam said he wanted to go over to sams and do some charlie so we went over there.  i overpaid the taxi by WAY too much because I was drunk and the note was crumpled. fucking shit. but i didnt realize it until right now when i got home and I'm really angry at myself for not paying attention. then we go into sams and hang out for like three hours. do some drugs and drink or whatever and have convo. hen adam talks to his bf, his bf comes over, then adam leaves with him. after what he did to him and after adam said he was going to not see him anymore. his bf is such a little fucking ugh, i cant even explain. he's such a little bitch. i hate him. so he tells me that he isn't leaving with him and then he does. and I'm so upset. I'm at sams alone with some weird girl and I just feel so... I don't even know. sam is trying to get to me. I can't even explain but it didn't feel right. i just wanted to go home and cry. and when I told him that, he changed the subject even though I was clearly starting to cry. he doesn't care either. everyone is so full of shit. 
i stayed longer. then I called a taxi. i didn't talk to him. i just went numb and silent. I felt myself crumbling and as soon as I walked in the door I felt like I was searching for something but there wasn't anything there. 
I wish so badly that something would make me feel better, but there was nothing.
I thought about adam, the guy i dated. about how I was there for him when he was down and how i cared so much for him and then how he ignored me and continues to ignore me.
i thought about my friend adam and how he left me there, about how he left me for some fucking asshole who is controlling and abusive. I thought about sam, who is projecting his salvation on me. I thought about a lot of things. and then I just sat down and cried. REALLY cried. i cried so hard that i couldnt cry and I just wanted to let everything out but it just felt painful buildup in my chest and I wished i would explode.
I don't know what to do. 
I need pure love right now but it just seems like everywhere I turn, I find false people who just want to use me or just don't care. and I'm feeling really disappointed and discouraged and angry and hurt and exhausted and frustrated and sad and alone. I feel so overwhlemed.
so what should I do? get my life on track and do what i ""should"" do? how many times have i said that I'm going to live my life right and then not done it.  why do i keep making the same mistakes? why do i care about the wrong things and the wrong people? why am i alone right now? 
I just can't get out how I feel but i feel horrible. i can't figure out solutions but i can see all my problems. I know what i need but it isn't available. so what am i supposed to do. 
i wish god would give me an answer but i feel like i scream and scream and no one hears me, like I am just getting thrown around by negative things and that I have just lost all control. and I feel things that i know from my past and I know its wrong but I can't stop it and then I fight for a bit and i'm running and not moving but in the end, I am pinned on the floor and then I just get sucked out of my room, way away. 
so is it night terror/sleep paralysis or is it that i am ignoring what is really going on in reality?"

"event","So I had an awesome weekend with Lorraine. We smoked, drank and rolled and it was just great to be with her. I totally miss home now and it was so hard going back on the train today. I cried almost the whole way back, could be my come down? But I just miss home so much and my friends from home, and my parents and my brother. Once again I am listening to Elliott Smith and studying for a test I have tomorrow. I am memorizing the political map of africa, pretty interesting stuff. I am in such a weird place, I am starting to become friends with these girls and they are really sweet. But again it is so weird, like why am I suddenly having to become friends with new people. I was originally friends with all these girls, but my roomate basically is exclusively hanging out with them and now I can't for some fuckin weird reason. I feel like middle school again, it is like 6th grade all over again and I am just not down with that. What happend to high school, no drama there. Why am I constantly having to stand up for myself? I mean I am proud of myself that I am able to be strong like that but I am just not sure why everyone seems to gang up on me. All I can dream and think about is home. Beautiful northern california where I belong. Fuck LA and there superficialities. Mark moved out, so now I am left with girls I am trying to be friends with and my roomates who pretend they like me. I can go over to mark's dorm, but it isn't the same and I just know I wont see him as much which is really weird. I am having such a hard time, all I want to do is lie in bed, watch rent and ignore my homework and everyone around me. Honestly I don't think I can come back next year, yes it is an education and that is such a priviledge I have, but I cannot put up with the people. There are two people that I trust at this school and that is so hard. It is really hard when you do not have friends that are girls for many reasons. There isn't anyone like all of you at home and that is so hard, im not looking to replace you all but I am looking for people that I can rely on. I cannot rely on a single person here to do anything. It is extremely weird to be in this situation, I am a talker and a story teller. When I cannot tell people what is going on in my life it feels weird. I can tell my guy friends but you know, they dont live right downstairs now so it is a little different. I dont really know where I am going with this, but I am just needing to vent out my feelings. 4 1/2 weeks until I get out of here!"

I'm eating crispy m&m's and drinking coffee, i'm not sure if this is a lethal combo or not, especially because i ate pizza right before for breakfast. ew what if i put the m&m's on the pizza and then soaked it all in coffee. hahah, well thats probably whats going on in my stomach right now.
arright what am i even talkin about... i donno...
i'm thinking of going to buy some cigs now but i kinda want to quit. i kinda want to quit everything bad that i've been doing.
I just put on some cursive. honestly i havent listened to them in like three months. they used to be my fave. 
....i just got distracted for like ten minutes...
okay so i feel very weird today. kind of giggly but depressed and I just don't even know whats going on in my head. 
i spent most of the weekend with adam, my friend. we went out on friday with some friends. I don't know if want to go out with them again because one of the guys, sam, he was being really weird with me. He wants me to be his girlfriend I think or maybe just bone me and I'm just really not interested in him like that. At the beginning of the night, i said that to him and it was fine with him but then as the night progressed, he kept getting mad at me everytime i would reject one of his attempts and by the morning he was telling me that he hated me because he loved me and I just really wanted to go home. 
I'm not sure what to do, because i can't ignore his calls forever but he doesn't listen to me when I say no to him and i can't have that.
I had so much fun with adam yesterday. we woke and got pizza and just chilled on my bed. we are pretty close friends now i think. 
oh god u kno what he told me. he went out after class with jason and he called me and i told him to say hi to jason for me (hah god only knows why). so jason talked about me , which is cool because i've kind of wondered what the fuck happened in his head, and well he said that he likes me and that i'm a sweet girl but he just didn't feel that click.
the funny thing is, i kinda knew. like I was always getting so nervous with him that I couldn't really be myself, mostly because i never knew what was going to happen and i was scared of rejection.
and my lover adam hasn't called. I guess that's it. I miss him. god i'm having the fattest infatuation with him. he is just so sexy to me. we didn't really click either. I knew it wouldn't work out but i just wanted it to last longer, a little longer.
agh i'm never going to have good sex like that ever again. jesus what am i going to do! I hate being celibate, noooooo. 
eww but i don't know what to do because everyone is gross and I don't want them touching me. 
haha, i was just thinking about when jason and I almost had sex, that was a nightmare, i was so nervous, i was about to scream and run out of his house. he made me feel like a virgin. i don't know why i find it funny. but looking back it was, i got myself into a total state. how ridiculous. At the time i felt so much pressure, i thought it was so important but now it all seems so completely ridiculous.
It's too true that you can like someone too much.
the worst thing is knowing that if i saw him now, i would be a nervous wreck. i really would. guys, they are just probelms in my head. what it really comes down to is that i need to get a vibrator and stop thinking about relationships. hah sorry.

okay i need to stop reminescing and regretting and laughing and get some shit done. I've been awake for two hours and I havent done anything but eat m&m's and think.  hah, thats sunday right there. next i'll be watching tv. no i must be strong and get cleaning and schoolwork done."

If i can't remember what i did wrong last time, how can i fix it. maybe in that one week when he was gone, and i obsessed and then forgave him when he came back, maybe that's where it will change this time. the clock is ticking, lost phone only counts for three days when he knows where i live.

"event","Lorraine gave me that name! I am officially a bro ho and I don't know how I feel about that. My two best guy friends and I have hooked up and now my name has been created. On wednesday night I decided I needed to get really drunk, so I got my friend Justin to buy me 99 Apples, a handle of Smirnoff, and stella's for mark. I called summer cause it was one of her last nights and she had nothing to do. So summer, mark, paul, pat whitney this guy whos good friends with them, and I all got drunk in marks room. Paul was hitting on me for most of the night cause he was already drunk, but he got really loud so we made him leave. Then pat came over and started hitting on me, it was kinda funny. I'm like oh so is this how it goes theres just a line of ppl, not sounding conceeded I was just surprised. So at this point I was gone, for all of u who do not know what 99 Apples is, it means 99 PROOF. Thats right it gets u fucked up! So Pat and I end up making out on marks bed, and mark was talking to me throughout this whole time. Then mark was like i dont care what happends just dont have sex on my bed. I was like im so sorry we are leaving. Its a school night and I have two roomates who never leave, so I was like sorry. But then we ended up going to this bathroom that has a lock on it. We tried to have sex but it wasn't really working we were just trashed. So we stopped and came back to marks room. It was nice cause we came back and mark was like did u fuck, and hes like nope. But he was still kissing me and stuff. So he left, and I passed out on marks bed. We talked till we went to bed. Then I was awoken by a fire alarm at 4:30am. The fire alarm went off 8 times throughout the night. The next day mark was like i fell asleep to the sound of ur voice, it was kinda nice. Then I got stoned and drunk with Paul on Friday and we ended up hooking up. So between the three of them its kinda crazy. I hope nothing gets different between mark, paul and i. I love you all hope you are entertained by my weird enconters."

"event","Ugh. So pretty much I decided to pull an all nighter last night so I could get all of my work done and caught up a couple days early and then just sleep all day today. I have an essay due tomorrow which I was planning on writing all night and then spending today editing it and making it better. Only I forgot that when you take caffeine pills, by a certain point nothing makes sense anymore. So I was sitting in the fucking library until 7 AM, twitching and trying to write a fucking essay. My mind was all over the place and my essay had  no focus. It just drifted from one idea to another and it was probably the worst writing of my fucking life. So I ended up stopping after two pages (it's supposed to be four pages) because it was so bad and because I couldn't focus. And here it is, the day before the essay is due, and I'm running off four hours of sleep (still better than running off caffeine pills). Anyways, so I walked back to my dorm as the fucking sun was rising. It's the weirdest feeling ever when you're heading back to sleep when  the day is just beginning to get light. It's like the world is reversed or something. And I seriously felt high walking back, but a bad type of high. I got really emotional and there were literally hundreds of crows in the sky flying above me, and for some delirious reason I convinced myself they would dive down and try to peck out my eyes. So I started running. And then I crossed a bridge and I convinced myself that either it would collapse below me or that a wind would come up and blow me off of it to my death. Really, I  don't know what the FUCK was going through my head, but the caffeine pills gave me some really weird, really bad trip. And then I lay in bed thinking about life and I felt schizophrenic or something. I was lying in bed trying to sleep and I couldn't. I kept on thinking about the crows. HAHAHA seriously it was the worst experience of my life. My advice to all of you: NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVEREVEREVEREVER TAKE CAFFEINE PILLS."

god I can't believe it's only been four days since I updated, it feels like its been a week. 
I'm having a really good week. I am so glad I have no college, it's the best thing ever. I should really be studying but I suck so I haven't been.
guess what I did last night??
I double dated, not in that two couples way, in that two guys in one evening way. It wasn't really a date with dexter but he thought it was so it kinda counts. I don't like him, why did I say yes again? right I'm living in the deluded land of friendship. I thought he was too but he asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend last night. I said no. I'm not attracted to him, we have nothing in common, to be honest, I don't even know why we are ""friends."" 
I went to go meet adam afterwards and we saw a film called MUNICH. incredibly violent but it was a good film. I almost cried three times, and thats saying something because I don't cry in films really. I was going to go meet heather afterwards but it was 11 and she hadnt even eaten and niether had I, so I think we'll go out tonight instead.  I hope adam will come too, I havent seen him in like a week, my friend adam that is.
Let me talk about my love affair with the other adam really quick. so I texted him on sunday and he asked if he could come pick me up. We didn't really part until tuesday afternoon. 
It was really fun. I'm in complete and total lust. I was looking at him last night in the theatre thinking , my god, he is like the sexiest man ever and he's got his hand on my knee, yes thank you thank you forces of earth.
On monday night he made me dinner, it was sooo good. I felt like such a couple with him, we got up on monday and got some french breakfast and then watched TV and then got japanese food and then went grocery shopping and drinking afterwards. We got some movies and he made dinner and it was so nice, thai curry.  then i spent the night again and we had a water fight in the bathroom. I already told noel this but I was laughing so hard I almost choked and spit toothpaste all over. It feels natural and its really cool. I kinda want to have his babies but after babysitting morgan yesterday, i think I'll pass on the whole kids thing. 
dude he called me at 430am, ""an accident,"" normally I would have gotten mad but I felt lonely in my bed and flattered that he drunk dials me. oh god I'm weird, no one else would see that as a good thing.
I've got to go drop off my uniforms at shakeaway tomorrow. I'm going to get paid, yay! but then I have to get a new job.  Can't I just have lots of money and sex/love and alcohol for nothing???
I bought the best toothbrush yesterday. it's the 360 from colgate, gives you a whole mouth clean. haha I sound like an ad. but swear to god, best toothbrush I've ever had, i highly reccommend it. 

I've gotta go grocery shopping now. damn it. you know what I have to admitt: 1. I have a terrible diet. 2. yesterday when I was at the pier with morgan, I was looking out on the water and I randomly said in my head, 'damn I miss jason.' It's so weird. I have been completely distracted for two weeks but randomly he's in my head, I even dreamt about him in adam's bed. damn. very bad. 
I kind of believe he is one of the few people in the world who has made my soul yearn. haha yearn, nice word.

I dunno it's really hard living with people, I am surrounded by people all day but some how I feel lonelier than ever. Alex, Jane and Sophie have been really annoying and exclusive. They all went to dinner last night and it was just so weird, like what did we do for them to be exclusive. I know it sounds like fucking high school bullshit but that's cause it is. I just miss the friends that make me feel so good. I like hanging out with Mark, but it's always a huge deal when I leave the room and stupid shit like that. I dont even care anymore, but I am just sick of not having a car, and a fake id. I hope to be getting these things within the next year. Ahhh I am so sick of shit right now.

I think I'm probably going to switch to being an English major because I realized that that's really what I love doing, reading and writing. And I'm still in a relationship with Matt, the skinny-ass guy. It's going fine, although I am so fucking fickle about it. Some days I'm just like, ""uuuhh this is boring. I wanna just be a slut"" and then other days it's really nice having someone who I can go to and just kiss and lay there. Don't know. And I'm living with him next year, and I thought it would be awkward. But I'm at the point now where we're good friends anyways and we'll be forced to not be awkward with each other so if it ends, which it probably will, then we'll just be friends. I still haven't lost the virg because I'm terrified of the pain....but I'll keep you all up to date when it does happen, which is probably soon (although I've been saying that for months). Classes have been FUCKING hard, with so much reading, and I've fallen so behind. These past couple weeks I've felt so drained because I've been low on sleep and so behind and staying up late every night trying to get caught up. And I'm almost there. By next week, I'll be back to normal. I also got a new job, at this cafe, and I kind of like it, although the hours suck (8 hour shifts, and closing shift is from 6 PM to 2 AM). I know! What. The. Fuck. Although literally the HOTTEST guy I've ever seen in my life came in last night and I was totally staring at him, so it definitely has its perks. Heh perks....But yeah, I've also been thinking about my summer plans because I don't really know what I'll be doing but I'd rather not live with Grandma and Grandpa all summer. I might live with my cousin Dave in the city and pay rent. Don't know...I've been really bipolar recently and some days I'm so happy and then others I'm just tired and miserable. But I've been getting better and the weather's been really sunny and beautiful and getting caught up in my classes has helped me readjust.

I'm wearing 4in heels and sweat pants. I'm just trying to wear in some new shoes I bought. I just spent all my money on them. I don't feel bad though, i love them and who needs food anyways when you've got great shoes hahah. ok i'm being sick now.
This weekend has faded past me. I haven't gone out or done anything really. I've got next week off so I'm not stressed really, i can go out tomorrow or whatever. 
I'm alone in the house right now. It's cool. I've got some peace and quiet. 
I wish I had some fun roommates, i could really play twister with some vodka 
wait I'm not alone, my aunt was just upstairs, hmm.
god we have the best cheese right now. I'm obsessed with it, its better than the ash cheese and swiss madrigal. 
yummy cheese. 
I have nothing to do now for the rest of the day. I want to see adam but I donno. I'm not really sure where I stand with him so I can't just go over on a sunday for a cuddle, even though that's what I want to do.
I got really irritated about some stupid shit on thursday. I practically stormed out of his flat but then we kissed and he said he'd call me later and instead of saying ""don't bother,"" like I meant to, i looked at him, with his fucking adorable smile and said sure but in that 'as if you will' kinda sure. 
then he calls me on friday, honestly i felt baited. he asked me what I was doing two weeks from now, because he might invite me to this hotel thing. so that kind of implies a two week commitment but he said maybe.  then I text him later because i've got class that day and he says, okay the 24th maybe. then I send him a text, basically laughing at him basically saying that I don't trust he'll be around that long and don't start.
I must have pissed him off because he hasnt texted or called since then. 
He's so not right for me. I don't know what I'm getting myself tangled up in. 
I slept too much last night and I'm having puffy eye syndrome.
gagagagagagaga
bored
gagaggagaaaa
i'll just go smoke some cigarettes. 
huuummmmmm i want cuddles, where are my loves when i need them. at least they dont try to turn affectionate moments into sexual opportunities. hmmm missing everyone."

"event","My brain is fried today. I have exhaustion induced insanity.
I went to college despite my three hours sleep and have processed nothing in the past 5 hours. I have to be there until nine so I've got three more excruciating hours to face.
I had a really good night last night. I went out with adam, not my gay friend but the guy i slept with the other night. we had a couple of drinks and then he took me out for dinner. It was really nice. The food was good and so was the company. He's actually not horrible inside like I thought, in fact he's sweet and funny and respectful. It's an interesting change for me. 
I'm not sure I entirely trust him yet, which is fine but it's probably a bad thing that I'm sleeping with him despite that. 
I'm not stressed about it at all. He's totally comfortable and it's nice to meet a guy that I can be completely honest with and who is nice to me and honest with me and who I am actually attracted to. 
The best part is that I have no expectations. We already told eachother all the bad shit about ourselves and we're both really honest. I like it. 
The food was so good too, normally I can't eat infront of guys but I donno, it was fine. and i was eating rice with chopsticks, normally that would have called for a serious panic attack. then he got dessert and was literally feeding it to me, it was hilarious, i feel like i've known him and been with him forever and i just met him three days ago. 
We went home and he made green tea and we just chilled on the couchand talked, then we started hooking up and his roommate walked in, haha. 
so we went upstairs and ya know, when we came back down at 2, we had more tea, haha so english, havin a cuppa after a nice shag. sorry TMI.
then we just chilled on the couch listening to good music and talking. 
It's totally the chillest fling ever and i love it. He's not playing games with me , we're just having fun together.
I'm in this weird state of content. He's not going to suffocate me because he's at work a lot but he calls when he says he will and he's honest, so it just works. not to mention the fact that we are completely compatible in the sack, its so cool.


that's basically why i updated, i need some food now. I finally have money so I can afford to get something to eat but I'm paranoid about my finances right now so I'm not sure what to buy because i'm still in pauper mode. 
I fancy a chicken burger. 
I can't wait to come back from college so i can go to sleep ahaha."

O-M-G-
great weekend!
I got shagged silly on saturday and it was soooooo nice.
went to a bar, hung out with adam and his bro and his bro's lady friend (lovers) and then some girl from his bio class, who insisted on talking about jason (basically she wants him and wont admitt it bcuz she has a bf) and got me kinda down when i had to reminesce about the rejection and then she goes on about how he is so mysterious (no, not really) and then wants me to talk about him, which i do and I remember how fucking amazing he is. I then I procceded to get terrificly drunk and she left and heather came. and i had a great chat with heather, who is the coolest ever. then we went to a club where i continued drinking and met this guy, whose name is also adam. wow. he's cute. he's also a druggy i think and a workaholic and very shallow but very honest (which i respect).
There is something very weird about waking up next to someone you dont really know. It's pretty unnerving. then you have sex again and its not so bad, but still a lil' awkward.
then you realize that he was better when you were drunk and no, it's probably not going to work out because you are very different ppl (mamas boy vs. christina) oh lord.
adam fouls of the 24 hr period: -when he came to my house, he insisted we look through my wardrobe (r u gay??)
-he kept not wearing a condom. (damn it, no pregnancy and stds, this must stop)(perk tho is that we had sex like 4x... and wow)
-he told me that i need to go shopping and buy some NEW NICE clothes, so that he can take me out and wine and dine me (genuine and nice?? hmmm... or terribly shallow and somewhat condiscending? both definitely)
- he took a shower, and got fresh in the morning, whereas I was still last nightish and smelled of alc, cigs and sex. GROSS. and he told me i smelled of alc.( hmm wonder why)

I basically don't know what to make of the situation. we are both honest, which was great and we had a lot of fun stuff to talk about. the next day, he was quieter and I kept nervously chattering (talking shit). then we were textin last night and he was speaking to me like I am his gf. kinda of nice but also odd.
I just don't know what to make of this specimen who has great equipment, great manners, great attitude and nice flat/car/face/clothes/job. 
I feel that he is out of my league and yet, I feel somehow superior. very odd. I am not materialistic or anything and he is and he does drugs. i quote ""I just like to work really hard in the week and get really cained (take loads of pills and get off my face) at the weekend""
i like this work hard, play hard attitude. but I'm sensing intensity from this guy that I am probably not ready for. its okay though, i'm chill.

I was talking to ayiesha on friday adn i was saying that I was kinda depressed and we talked for a long time about A LOT of stuff and I realized that I'm not adapting very well here. for the rest of the weekend, I took on a new perspective and well thought okay, be open to change. It worked well.
here's the point I'm making: this guy, he wants to change me superficially. should i be open to the change??
on one hand there is my belief that all that fashion shit doesn't matter. then there is the point that it is important to take pride in yourself, whether that pride should be exhibited in the form of materials is a point that can be easily debated. then there is the fact that, if I don't care about that stuff and I KNOW i'm not shallow, so what does it matter if i dress nice or not, do i feel like a sellout when i look nice? why should I? It's only natural to want to look nice, to be attractive and whatever. I already know that it's not a matter of serious importance to me so thats what matters right?
And maybe my avoiding fashion is a bigger issue, maybe it has to do with the fact that I don't want to commit to an image because let's face it, ppl judge you on your clothes, they classify you as soon as they meet you. I don't want to be classified, but it doesn't matter if I fight it, it happens anyways, so do i A. protest and not wear clothes (jk) or B. make up my mind about the kind of person I want to be and dress like that. 
AGH, i hate thinkin about this shit. i seriously don't know the answer. I'm going to have to wait until my finances are sorted out anyways so i'll just try to not stress about it. I just want to be adaptable and not feel insecure here all the time.  
i'm going to go take comfort in my math homework now.
fuck i have to call this guy. i don't want to go out, he thinks i dress like shit. damn it. god, its like great guy with great sex vs. insecurity. very tough to balance."

I got trapped sitting next to some guy who thinks he has something to say, which he seemed intent on proving to me throughout the lesson. I kept sighing in defeat, hoping that he would get the message but no. 
I have learned an important lesson, never sit near him and if he sits near me, I should promptly move.
There was sunshine today. It was great.
I spent last night fantasizing about going to the park with jason and a couple of beers and talking about home and having a great night. then I realized that he could have easily been replaced with any guy and that I just wanted to have a carefree night loving my home.
I'm over it. 
Right before we went on our first date, I said to myself, if you can't be friends you can't be lovers.
do friends lie to you and mislead you and then not have the decency to call?
He is no friend and he is not mr. right but just another mr. wrong who I have falsely felt inclined towards and allowed to deppreciate me. 
Aren't I just so much better than that? 
i think that was bad english.
I am better than that. I shouldn't put up with shit from people, I was about to say because, but I realized that there is no because, I just shouldn't do it.

Last night i was thinking about rodeo beach and stalty grove and sausalito and I thought I might explode with desire. 

I felt like going for a walk earlier but then I realized I might see one of the many dysfuntional weirdos that inhabit this city and changed my mind. 
It's not that I'm snobby it's just that they are evil.

I am friendless right now. Adam is currently engaged himself with this guy josh and has basically replaced me. Scott never comes to college anymore and when he does, we sometimes have fun or he doesn't really talk to me and then he always goes straight to see his gf.  Laura left to austria. 
Damn I feel lonely. 
my nails need some tending to. I should probably do my homework.

Am I still your charm, or am I just bad luck?

I LOVE YOU!!!!

this is going in alphabetical order.

CECILY: you are creative and wild. not just in terms of your last name either. you are goofy and silly sometimes and it's great to have a friend that you can talk complete nonsense to just for fun of entertaining some ridiculously fulfilling conversation. Your are fascinated by the world. Your try hard, you are responsible in the most incomprehensible way. You should be more confident than you are, because you are a strong and thoughtful person and you don't realize that.

ELISA: jesus, what isn't there to love? where do i start. You are intelligent and funny and openminded and concerned and thoughtful and lively and unique and understanding/empathetic and recently, very wise. Life is hard sometimes, but I have faith that you are strong enough to handle it. When you hurt, realize that you have also felt free, when you feel sad, realize that you have also felt happy, when you feel like giving up, remember that you have also felt like trying. Maybe there is too much going on, but you are capable and you have a lot of time if you need it and you have all the support of the people around you. 

ERIN: You radiate beauty from the inside to the out. You've always been the hot one, but it's more than that, you are so gorgeous. You are fun and deep and confident. you are not afraid to show your appreciation of the good things in life, like chocolate and your dog and guys and music and freedom.  I wish there were more people like you in the world. You are sweet as honey, as passionate as fire and you know how to live. Don't be afraid to know your own worth and don't let anyone hurt you because they don't.
 
NOEL: damn we go back. back to edna, back to when we both lived in the little part of mill valley, back to when our brothers hated eachother and so did we. Back to when you were prissy and I was a tomboy. Back to the hellish days of middle school when girls stabbed you in the back more than they brushed their teeth. and the truth is that we did it too. We learned some of the most important lessons in friendship together, and I'm sorry for everytime I ever hurt you. I love you a lot. A LOT. here's why I love you so much. You are a girl who has been hurt a lot and seen a lot of hurt but you don't let that affect your optimism and your eyes still shine, and I guess that is that angelic light within you. okay that sounded cheesey, we all know that your no angel, i know your dirty secrets but you are certainly a very, very good person. You take things as they are and deal with them as they are. your accepting and loving and it shows through your actions. you are determined and sensitive and non judgemental. I love how you cry when something upsets you and you aren't scared to show how you feel. It's really beautiful to see someone live with the feeling that you do. I have all the faith in the world that you will be happy because good things come to good people. 
i could easily write two pages about how great you are and how much your friendship means to me.

PETER: You can be brutally honest but it's brutally funny and incredibly needed in most cases. I wish there were more guys like you, funny and intelligent, responsible and honest, crazy and sane. basically what I'm trying to say is that I want to marry you. it's really a pity that your gay, you and me or you and elisa or you know, fuck it, back to my mormon ways, you, elisa and me would have been a great couple or threesome. 
most of the time you are right about things. you are logical yet not uncreative. There is no one else I'd rather dance with. You aren't shallow or egotisitcal (despite what you sometimes think of yourself) and I love you.

SAMANTHA: oh sam. i love you. having you as my neighbour for quite sometime was really cool. We've enjoyed many do nothing, fun days. I like your musical taste and i'm sorry that everyone gives you shit. I like your unique fashion sense and we enjoy the same comedy. I hate your taste in guys but respect your taste in pretty much everything else. If I believed in past lives, I'd say you are a young spirit, but not in a naive or bad way. You've had a lot of cool experiences and perhaps I should talk to you about them more. I love it when you roll your eyes and when you get really drunk and act silly. you got your first kiss at my house and I remember when you used to think that promiscuity was a bad thing. You've grown up a lot since I've met you and I have to say that after seeing you in london, I still like who you are even though you've changed and matured.  

STELLA: holy shit i love you. If i was going to be a lesbian, it would be down to you and elisa as my soulmates. You are brave. You are one of the few people who is intelligent because of your experience in the world and not because of what you learned in school. You are artistic, you have an eye for beauty, and not the vogue magazine kind, the real fuckin beauty in the world. You are cultured and well rounded. You know how to behave but it doesn't impair your ability to behave as you please and I respect that. You're up for life and its opportunities. You're outgoing and funny. You speak spanish and french like a pro and I wish I could too. There are very few people who I can say that I could live and travel with, but I could live and travel with you.  I can talk to you about anything. You are articulate and you say incredible meaningful and true things about life. I would hang out with you anywhere, from in the back of my truck to in amsterdam. somethings don't change no matter how old you get or where you are and one of those things is how I connect to you. I hope we are friends until we are old and withered (which we will never be because you and I are not the kind to wither). i love you. get ur ass over to england because i'm too broke to go to paris otherwise i'd already be there and be basking in stellashine (which is better for you than sunshine because it contains no UV rays)."

"event","I have a massive bump on my head. It's a UDI (unidentified drunken injury). I woke up this morning and I couldn't remember what happened last night. after a few minutes it came back to me. 
I almost threw up in the cab ride home. He kept trying to talk to me. I was like ""SHUT UP I""M FUCKIN WASTED AND I FEEL LIKE THROWING UP!!!""   except i didn't say anything like that because I'm much too nice. I just tried to keep from vomiting. 
I've realized that i've got to GOT TO stop drinking. I'm actually going crazy. 
Thank god I gave him a fake number.
I was acting like a maniac last night.  

I remember when I didn't drink for a week and I felt really good. Now I feel like a crazy drunk. 
I just said some really bitchy things to my cousin's friend. How dare he argue with me about rape. fuckin patronizing bastard. 

New year's resolution: to take care of myself."

"event","Last night my girlfriends and I went to Hollywood to go clubbing, and it totally reminded me of our City Night times in the summer. This time there were much cuter boys that went to LMU, and it was amazing. They have three rooms, one rap, one 80s and one alternative music. We met some cute boys from LMU and I ended up making out with a guy for two hours. haha like im being incredibly serious we never stopped and we danced while we were making out so it was even hotter. He had a lip pierce which I always find hot. All of my friends had a guy so it worked out well and it was a blast. I can't wait till we all get to be together drinking and catching up I really miss you girls like crazy. Spring Break is gonna rock! I love you all and keep writing in the blog so I get to hear about your lives."

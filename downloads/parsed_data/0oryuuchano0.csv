But, alas, I care too much about my brothers to do that.... >< Ah well, I think I'm ""in like"" (love, but I don't want to say love until I'm sure...) But I'm not telling who. That ruins my whole illusion that he may actually go out w/ me.... ^^; I think I'm gonna ask him to Homecoming either next month or sept. Fun, ne? He completely makes me melt. I'm like putty....

Sometimes I give in to sadness
Sometimes I don't
Doo doo doo doo
At times I'm part of the madness
Sometimes I won't
Give in to you
You see in a way
I have been drifting down a river
To nowhere
And you've given me nothing
But if you're ready to be my everything
If you're ready to see it through this time
And if you're ready for love then
This I will bring
But I'm not gonna wait for you forever this time
Ladeeda ayo

At times I'm not
Doo doo doo doo
Yeah yay
What's with the guilt that you styling baby
Talk don't look good on you
You see in a way
I have been looking for a reason to go there
And you're leading me nowhere

But I'm not gonna wait for you forever this time

Are you waiting for a special occasion
To give me your heart
Cause I need a little confirmation
To make a real start
Don't wait till it's too late
Are you ready to show me?
Are you ready to love me?
You see in a way
I have been drifting down a river
To nowhere
And you're giving me nothing
And if you're ready to be my everything
If you're ready to see it through this time
And if you're ready for love then

I dunno. I'm in a really confused and mixed up mood at the moment. Everything is backwards. Especially with my feelings... I don't know- Paul is so uber-cool... and I really want to go out with him, but he hates me. I don't know what I did. Maybe I'm just a loser?

****Ehmm... I- I'm kind of shook up... I- I don't know what to make of the dream I just had... First off, have you seen Little Nicky? It has to do with that... //sighs\\ Well, it started off like usual, you know, the FFX2 Oasis, the splashing, etc, and ended up with John kissing me once again, but this time... I- I let go to breathe for a second in the middle of the kiss and he- he was- he was Dru! It was so freaky!!! Then he said ""What, no tongue?"" and wiggled his tongue at me. (He did it like... like Adrian does to Nicky's girlfriend in Little Nicky. You'd have to see the movie to understand.) The worst part was that he was dressed as Seymour, whom I've become accustomed to associating with cute and cool-ness. I freaked and screamed in the dream and guess I screamed in my sleep. I think I woke myself up with my own shrieking.... >< It was so- scary! There's no other way to put it, seriously, absolutely no other word could describe that dream. I- I had to go and brush my teeth when I woke up!! Yich!! (No offense, Dru, it's just... well... I don't know what it *was*, it was bad, though. Bad even for your kind of perverted-ness.)**** 

****journal from around 9:00pm March 18, 2004****
****Yeah, I keep rereading that dream I had last night and... It's so- freaky! To think that happened the night before I tell Dru that I basically *hate* him. He called me a whiny bitch! I may be a bitch, but I'm not whiny unless I have to be. ><; Monk and Liz seem to agree with me. I don't know, I just don't think he should be saying things about Natalie even if he's never met her. He based his opinion of her on an opinion of a video game because of what she wore! He's always saying that people hate him and label him. Well, what do you call that? No it's not *labeling*, Dru would never *label* someone because of what they wore!!! //gags on the sarcasm\\ Gah, I hate people that contradict themselves. I'm not saying that I don't do it as well, but he does it far too often and I'm absolutely *sick* of it! ><; 
Anyway, on to happier topics! I almost beat someone up at lunch today. This chick keeps coming over to our lunch table and pissing me off! She's been doing it for about two weeks, and she's awful. Seriously, she called me ugly for the last time today. I know I'm nothing to look at but she had no room to talk. Ask anyone! Larry had to hold me back because I almost wailed on her ass. -_-; I really dislike her, and she drives me nuts, and she knows it, so its worse!! Grrr... ^^*
Yah, I wanna start a new story soon. Maybe I'll finish it! Wow! But that's a strech. I never finish anything. >< (Although I try my hardest....) Ah! And thanks to Rizu-sempai and Monk-sama for defending me. I feel uber-loved! Well now, I must be off to the shower-y goodness because it is nine thirty. //wanders away humming ""Suteki Da Ne""\\****"

Squirrel Ninjas unite!! Anyway, on the whole Jess and Dru matter, its okay, I really don't mind... It's not a big thing. You know, if they like eachother, then they have my best wishes as long as Dru is good to her, cause if he isn't, he'll have to deal with me on his ass. ><! Heh, I'm sure some people won't be as nice about it, but hey, what am I gonna do, you know? I love Jess and I don't want to lose her as a friend any more than I want to lose anyone else. I hope Liz isn't angry that I'm okay with this, even though she's not the type to be angry about something like this. ^^;;; Eh, I'm so excited about life in general. Tekko was so cool, and I made like a million new friends! Dac (""David""), John (Seymour), Ange(Lulu), and Natalie(Rikku), the Yohji chick, KT, Adam, Kenshin, and my date, Squall girl, little Vash, Alucard, and a whole bunch of others(the Yaoi man, and The Prince of Darkness with the evil Cloud) etc...). ^___^ Yes, Tekko, was fun-ness.

<Li>My #1 result for the SelectSmart.com selector, <a href=""http://www.selectsmart.com/FREE/select.php?client=housesort""><B>A More Meaningful Harry Potter House Sorter</A></B>, is <I>Ravenclaw: You are gifted with an imagination that allows you to see the world in a different light than other wizards. Your curiosity pushes you to learn, and your artistic nature drives you to make your own creations. Ravenclaws are scholars and craftsmen, learning all they can about something and then trying to improve its design. You enjoy puzzles and the challenge of the unknown, but not if it involves too much personal danger. Being strongly opinionated and sensitive about your creations, you prefer working alone than in groups. Unfortunately, this sometimes makes you appear selfish and unfriendly, and you may even feel underappreciated at times. But it is thanks to you Ravenclaws that spells and magical devices keep improving each year. Be careful, however, for Ravenclaws have also been known to be so focused on the beauty or greatness of their inventions, that they don't realize how dangerous they can be in the wrong hands!</I><P>

Your Existing Situation
Works well in cooperation with others but is disinclined to take the leading role. Needs a personal life of mutual understanding and freedom from discord.
Your Stress Sources
The existing situation is disagreeable. Has an unsatisfied need to ally herself with others whose standards are as high as her own, and to stand out from the rank and file. Her control of her sensual instincts restricts her ability to give herself, but the resulting isolation leads to the urge to surrender and allow herself to merge with another. This disturbs her. as such instincts are regarded as weaknesses to be overcome; she feels that only by continued self-restraint can she hope to maintain her attitude of individual superiority. Wants to be loved or admired for herself alone; needs attention, recognition, and the esteem of others.
Your Restrained Characteristics
Clings to her belief that her hopes and ideas are realistic, but needs encouragement and reassurance. Applies very exacting standards to her choice of a partner and wants guarantees against loss or disappointment. Circumstances are forcing her to compromise, to restrain her demands and hopes, and to forgo for the time being some of the things she wants. 

Your Desired Objective
Needs to feel identified with someone or something and wishes to win support by her charm and amiability. Sentimental and yearns for a romantic tenderness
Your Actual Problem

And number three I got a first place, a second place and a third place in the tournament on saturday!! I did so much better than I thought I would, so I'm really glad! I was so surprised that he actually used my design. I didn't think he would, cause I thought hed change his mind at the last second. Hehehehe, I'm so happy. Oh, I saw fifty first dates on Sunday. That is a great and sad movie, and Adam Sandler is hotter than ever, even his egg shaped head, lol

I am an Amethyst Dragon!

Hey, I took the http://dragonhame.com online Inner Dragon quiz and found out I am a Amethyst Dragon on the inside. 

In the war between good and evil, a Amethyst Dragon tends to walk the fine line of Neutrality....
When it comes to the powers of Chaos vs. those of Law and Order, your inner dragon walks a fine line between Law and Chaos....
As far as magical tendancies, Magical spells come as natural to the Amethyst Dragon as breathe from it's body....
During combat situations, whether by spells or by claw, your inner dragon will do whatever it takes to get the job done....
The Amethyst Dragon makes its home in the deep caverns of the earth, often in mountainous regions. They spend much time in hibernation as one of their favorite things to do is to sleep.'
Formed from translucent amethyst, it is an awe inspiring sight to see one in it's true form. Light passes through the dragon's body creating a deep purple glow. It's scales will magnify the light rays into bright lavender beams to highlight this effect.'
Amethyst dragons spend most of their time homebound but do occasionally feel the need to take a sojourn to a far destination. These dragons love books and will often pick their destination from one of the many stories and histories they may have read. Amethyst dragons are very solitary in nature, but do keep a distant watch on the world around them. They tend to be highly intelligent, and often amuse themselves in human form by building gadgets and toys. Amethyst dragons are very learned creatures.
'
This Dragons favorite elements are: Amethyst, Deep Places, and Magic"

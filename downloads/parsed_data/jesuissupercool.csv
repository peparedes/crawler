"event","hmm its been so weird.  lately right after tennis i become exhausted.  not tired, EXHAUSTED.  No matter what my diet is or the amount of sleep I get, this cycle has been going on all week.  My body temperature hasnt shifted between about 95.6-97 for the past few days.  I researched it online and maybe i should go see a doctor.  it might be a thyroid problem apparently because ive suffered bad depressions, major pre menstrual problems, and weight gain, memory problems, and abnormally slow thinking as well. hmmmm...ill see how my body temperature fairs today.

nates bday party was fun.  i got a little pissed at darin.  he's not my favorite person and then he made a jerk comment so i was ready to leave.  garden state was such an awesome movie and scrabble was fun except for that last pick of 7 vowels that cost me the game wah.

my friends are all taking the new SATs.  goood luck!  i take em in may, and tonight is junior miss."

"event","i'm feeling super nostalgic, but it's been worse.
Have you ever had that feeling-that crappy one...the one where you know you're never going to see someone again?
All last year I lived in my little naive moment every moment.  When they started crying saying we were never going to see eachother again, i hadn't understood.  Now I do.  It makes me sick to think of everyone and how we're all living our seperate lives when once we were so close.  how i haven't even sent or received any letters or postcards and have only called u cait.
So sick...things wont' ever be the same, even if i go back.

When I look at my pictures lately i have to take a deep breath and tell myself that it was real...i really did walk along that street over a bazillion times.  i once only spoke french and didnt even have to worry the SATs or grades or school pretty much in general.
The Alps were real, the clubs were real, the people were real, the pain was real, the joy was real, the excitement was real, the eiffel tower really does exist, the moulin rouge really does exist.
I know I'll romanticize things too much...I already am.  I know things will never be the same when I go back.  I haven't even really kept in contact with my host families...god im so lazy and so poor to even afford to send a present.  god i actually have no excuse.

"event","woke up late- was lazy. saw dee daniels and attended her workshop which was awesome.  tried to watch ""lady be good"" but musicians don't really interest me, even if they are women...i was hoping for some vocalists.
saw andrew play bass and it was pretty awesome...especially when you went crazy on that second song and we all clapped.
lazied around.  tried to make mom a birthday cake but it ended up less than an inch high and green.  she was in a nobody likes me everybody hates me mood anywho.

Hm I think I used to feel ashamed for not being as appreciative of certain bands and music as some of my friends, but honestly, I can listen to Hendrix and like him, but don't sue me if I'm not bowing down to him and worshipping him at your depth.  I really tend to focus more on and vocalists and lyricists.

This festival has revamped my singing passion, horrah!

Grab your coat and get your hat
leave your worry on the doorstep
just direct your feet
to the sunny side of the street

Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
and that happy tune is your step
life can be so sweet
on the sunny side of the street

i used to walk in the shade
with those blues on parade
but i'm not afraid
this rover, crossed over
if i never had a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller!
Gold dust at my feet
on the sunny side of the street.

"event","It felt good.  It felt good, so I'm ecstatic.  All I wanted was to feel comfortable, have fun, and be happy with my performance, and all of the above were acheived.

I went to first period choir then took katrin and went to this dance workshop which ended up for people who have never taken dance so we left because it was boring, however, I know the teacher phyllis gooden-young?  having taken dance classes with before, and i like her.
we went back to my place and i took a shower and got ready with my hot outfit, black pumps, sparkly make-up and a flower in my hair and i warmed up for her and ian.
we went to the hartung where i warmed up and was up first from moscow.  i felt really good about my performance and i got some nice compliments.

sorry i was going to make this brief...but here

so, i didn't win nor did jessica and the two girls who did...were incredible.  Like, you hear our choir and you think aw how nice they're in tune and that sweet soloist. but these chicks were up with diana krall.  in fact, in all honesty i would have chosen the second singer's cd over diana krall's.  yes, they were effing indescribable.  I was smiling and had tingles listening to the performances at the concert tonight.

GEORGE CARSON WON and he did an amazing performance-the audience loved him. CONGRADULATIONS!

God, I love jazz and I'm so thankful for this festival and how it gets me motivated to spend more time creating music and appreciating the art of such an emotional, expressive, and laid-back style.  hallelujah.

Tomorrow I'll hopefully be attending performances by something-or-another feather, dee daniels (seriously amazing singer), and im gonna watch that documentary lady be good.  thats my plan at least.  oh and ya, krystyn, i saw Jane Monheit- she did some kick-arse scat.

Artist : The White Stripes
Album : Elephant


When problems overwhelm us and sadness smothers us where do we find the will and the courage to continue? Well the answer may come in the caring voice of a friend,a chance encounter with a book, or from a personal faith.
For Janet help came from her faith, but it also from a squirrel. Shortly after her divorce, Janet lost her father, then she lost her job.
She had mounting money problems. But Janet not only survived she worked her way out of despondency and now she says, life is good again. How could this happen? She told me that late one ??? day when she was at her lowest she watched a squirrel storing up nuts for the winter, one at a time he would take them to the nest. And she thought, if that squirrel
can take care of himself with the harsh winter coming along, then so can I. Once I ripped my problems into small pieces I was able to carry them,just like those acorns, one at a time.

Take all your problems
And rip 'em apart
Oh Oh Oh
Carry them off
In a shopping cart
Oh Oh Oh

And another thing you
Should've known from the start
The problems in hand
Are lighter than at heart

Be like the squirrel, girl
Be like the squirrel
Give it a whirl, girl
Be like the squirrel

And another thing
You have to know in this world
Cut up your hair
Straighten your curls
Well you problems
Hide in your curls"

"event","Well, I'm performing tomorrow at 1pm, and I'm not nervous...actually I'm a bit nervous of getting nervous because, more than anything, I really want to get up there, have fun, and give an outstanding performance-I don't care about placement.  (yesterday my mom and i with help of adiddy got THE cutest jazz outfit for me!  hoorah!) Right after me Friday is Jessica, then Lara, then Pauline from MHS.
I think I might take some dance workshops in the morning like the great dances of broadway cuz i really really miss lorraine's jazz technique.  i hope it's not for beginners and not super easy though :(.

It happened.  I took on way too much and i just got so stressed yesterday...unfortunately in front of Ian, but he gave me some very well placed advice and everything is magically better somehow.  awesome friend. im gonna drop ballet and now im doing tennis and jazz dance and voice lessons and thats the extra curricular crap now.  i realized that in order not to be a complete day-dreaming dolt at school i have to get to sleep earlier, and...

read my next post for some nice advice from the white stripes..."

I need to get out though I think...i need a change of atmosphere-my sister says i need an adventure and im apt to agree with her.  i need to go rock climbing or on a hike with fellow adventurer ian.  i need to get away for the summer and really go work at an art museum and live with one of my aunts.  i need to dump whatever's giving me this cynical and pessismistic outlook.
hmm i want to go to mount holyoke or wellesley really bad...but i also want to be in an urban area really bad.
i miss the city. i miss the noise, the hustle, the life, the diversity, the culture of the city.

and-one big embrace for you all for making life better sometimes and teaching me how to think differently."

Ian cooked me fondue
which we had at a candle lit table
alone downstairs with a beautiful orchid as a centerpiece and a view of lit-up moscow from the window

we had a glass of beaujolais 2001 each

"event","hmm wow-bethany's comment helped me see something in a different light which was nice.  I wish our breakup could have been handled so much more maturely.  i tried talking to him many times- i truly wanted to maintain a friendship with him even though times were hard...but his responses lead me to really believe that he just didn't care.  i didnt want to believe he cared so little about me anyway but i wonder if someday he'll look back whenever that day is and go...hmmm maybe i could have handled that differently. 
last night we saw the mumbles and purl.  the guy in the mumbles reminded me completely o fjack white but smaller.  purl was really awesome but the singer should scream more...sing less and one of the guitarists looked so much like billy corgan- im super tempted to go to their concert this friday in pullman if i can.
theres a free concert at the SUB feb 16.  Bang Bang is the band or something?  i really wanna go.
katrin and i went bikini shopping yesterday too and saw kt and lexi for a breif while it was pretty funny.  we were dancing around in bikinis in the zumiez dressing room and all i could think was...if only zach were here now haha.  i like the frilly green one!
I hung out mostly with ian.  never even imagined a lot of this...it's really great.  i think we're on the same level in so many things."

Falling out of sleep
To the last goodbyes
Who cares why?

Mother, I've tried
Wasting my life
I haven't given up, I lie
To make you so proud in my eyes
Falling out of sleep
Crawling over me
To the last goodbyes
Who cares why?

Tuesday's come and gone
Restless, still I drive
Try to leave it all behind
Falling, falling out of sleep
Falling, falling with the leaves
I go crawling, crawling over me

<i>Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
I went falling
I went falling</i>...

Mother, I hope you know
That I miss you so
<b>Time has ravaged on my soul
To wipe a mother's tears grown cold</b>"

""c'etait incroyable""  warm fuzzies warm fuzzies.

I went with katie, katie, shinai, becca, and lexi to the pita pit today but let me tell you, Jared Lien walking straight into the pole made my day, man.  i fell i was laughing so hard and started crying...even the bus driver who saw him said ""oooh, better get a liscence plate number for that sign"".

""Boogeyman"" was pretty scary.

"event","haha katrin made me laugh so hard i almost peed my pants tonight.  we have to do this cheesy hop step for one of our dances and we were being videotaped so suddenly she goes off on this native american dance and im like wtf hahahaha it was excellent- i joined in.
then after we finished she looks at me out of nowhere and was like i LOVe doing this when im drunk- and started doing the robot.  
apparently her and i have the most ""expression"" in our lyrical dance- we did a happy dance when our teacher told us so and jessie was like psh rub it in haha.

okay this is a gross story but of course fascinating: umm so katie and jessie and amanda were telling us about how one time at a ballet class last semester this guy stood outside the door just watching them NAKED and im not sure how he got away from the director but he did and when they went out there to ""go to the bathroom"" there was a puddle of ""man"".
A;OWIEJHGAIOWJGE3;AIOWJ3G;I!!!!!!!!!!EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

on a different disgusting note:
My dad told me before i left he never had a child like me who was so disrespectful, terrible blah blah then told me to get out and didnt want to talk to me.  i asked him how i could change for better but he just shook his head at me.  i thought jessie said he was on my side?  for once id love to share how I felt-not in an angsty teenage way but really just say that I feel lonely, I want to be able to talk to them and that I don't walk out on purpose when they're talking but sometimes I'm afraid they'll say something mean to me.

I got my grade report- i have a 3.7 gpa and my parents didnt even look...not even after i told them it was there.  i wanted to go to swing dancing tonight but cant because apparently my mom ""never sees me study for school"".

hmmdy doo.  i pretty much just take it-i mean theyre my parents.  i really really though feel hopeless and it stresses me out sometimes...really bad.  I have no idea what to do-its frustrating and all i want to do is escape somehow...
that pms depression most likely wasnt pms.  i think i subconsiously take in the pain and stress cuz i cant really express it unless i decide to throw my chest of drawers across the room again.  so i guess i just get depressed and ""dont know why"" and my whole back is a rock *sigh*.  but i feel strangely optimistic and peaceful.

hung out with the ian and andrew after school fun stuff.

OH AND MY FAVORITE BAND IS ZWAN IF U KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME

"event","I'm really glad my mom bought this Madeline Peyroux cd.  She's like a modern Billie Holiday which is exquisite my friend.
My final paper for English was on a link I found between the books we read in class and a liberal anti-establishment theme.  I got a 43/50 and a B+ in the class- Mr. Hill was like, this is gonna be higher this semester, right?  I think I will just kick some ass this semester.
I thought having U.S. History with the sophmores would suck, but Mr. Wear seems like a nice guy and I sit behind Sara Young's beautiful hair.  I also sit near Emma who/m? everyone seems to know but me...Christian really wants me to switch to Hoogsteen with him which would kick, but I'm pretty apathetic.
It's kind of funny to analyze the people in the class-and judging ONLY from that class, I feel like there is a bit of a maturity gap just from one year.  It's interesting and I cannot believe that I was living alone in France at ""their age"".  What the hell was I thinking.  Oh but when I think that I love myself for having guts- I also know I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
I'm thinking about giving L'etranger by Albert Camus a chance again.  I read it last year and found it pretty bland yet melodramatic and I'm wondering if I'd appreciate it now.  Plus, I really really wanna read in French again- I'm jealous the seniors are reading Candide-that sounds like a kick arse book.
I wish I were uglier-is that wrong?  To tell you the truth I think that people respect ugly people more...that the compliments I'd recieve would have nothing to do with fleeting physical beauty.  I wouldn't be so disgustingly vain and distracted by my physical appearance, nor distract anyone else from more important things.
ryan parks is an awesome guy.  i enjoy talking with him because he is so open-minded, accepting and wise and he makes me feel bad when im immature haha.  (that whole martin thing).
and how could i let you go without saying
ian rocks."

<h2>You are a Water Sex Goddess!</h2>
You enjoy the slower and calmer things in life.  

But that doesn't mean your sex life is slow and calm. 

You love sex and take it for all it's worth.  

Everything you do is sensual or mysterious - and guys absolutely adore you for that!  

You're not easy or desperate, but you know what you want.  

Sometimes you can be a little picky, but, you want only the finest!  

Sex with you is amazing because it's deep and hard... and sometimes a little painful.  

You have almost a dual personality when it comes to sex. 

In public you're shy or quiet, but in the bedroom, you can't be tamed!

our dance teacher likes me a lot which makes me feel good cuz she rocks too. then my dad came in to class 10 min before it ended and said that mom was made i took her car without asking (even though i did the day before and it was fine?) and so he had to take it back so i was like w/ever...went with katin to her house to get ready then went swing dancing.  
Swing dancing kicked my butt it was awesome and i loved lindy hop and being dipped! 
then katrin and i walked over to henry's where they were having a going away party for alex the australian...we just hung out and talked for a bit..jessie k. is THE funniest person i've seen drunk before ""it's my smock!""  then i went home.
friday kicked-i hung out the whole day with ian. then we basically went all over town and hung out with multiple people and what an awesome day.

Becca is one of the most gorgeous women i know!  she has this voluptuous, womanly body-the stuff artwork is made out of, and when you look at her it is like damn, she is gorgeous.  She has one of the most beautiful complexions and features...her eyes are such a beautiful bright blue, her hair could be any color and still look good.  She's so confident with herself and has this energetic, outgoing personality.  She's intelligent, funny, charasmatic, and you know you could trust your life with her because she has one of the purest, caring hearts.
i luv becca!  the chicas guardian angel.
Last night I picked up a bit of my room and listened to Dancing Queen by Abba pretty loud and my dad wasn't too happy but i sure was ! dannnccinnng queen youuungg and sweet only 17.  movie night was alright last night.  okay so im not freaked out anymore, i'm super excited because ian rocks my world.  too bad when im nervous, the dumbest crap comes flying out of my mouth."

and a big sigh!  I can't believe Saint Andrew's College is getting sued-that's kind of funny and the co op is moving to Garts.  i'm just sad cuz that means they'll be closed at some point in the future, but makes me happy that they are so succesful and even though we live in a weeny town, we have access to good food.
I hung out with Ian last night and even though erin's was packed (literally!) guys were nice and let me sit on the couch anyway, i still felt kinda bad.  I really like Ian  -very vulnerable sigh.
Hopefully I am going to treefolk tomorrow, should we all dress like hippies?

Today my sister woke me up calling and my phone appeared back in my room magically (my mom gave it back) so i plugged it in even though the machine had picked up and got to talk to her.  She was going off on how her ex bf used to compliment her breasts all the time so when he dumped her she had to compliment her boobs all the time?  and then the machine stopped recording and i told her it stopped recording now and she was like AHHH DELETE IT! it was pretty funny.  i think she was telling me to love myself or boobs or like ya.  i love my sister(s).  people are like, how can u be okay with your mom and stuff and i forgot to mention two very special people in my life: my sisters.

Meet:
Lorien Lightfield (34 yrs. old)
professional mountain bike and road bike racer, married to darren lightfield whos a crazy skier and semi pro mtn bike racer.

Her advice?  Sarah, maybe because you're the last of the litter mom sees a piece of her life drifting away and you get all of her pain.  Maybe you should come live with us in Boise, we'll feed you and get you to school, but you'd have to realize you're an adult and  financially independent as well.
She is such a hippy!  I love Lorien!

Jessie Dickerson (32 yrs. old)  (19 at heart)
She currently resides in Washington D.C., spent 8 years in the military, and says i inspired her to go to Costa Rica and volunteer there pretty soon.  She is single and I think she deserves the greatest guy out there.  We are good friends now, but her advice?  I wish I could do something, but you're just going to have to hang in there.
Cait loves Jessie-mostly because jessie still acts like shes 19.

The White Stripes - We're Going To Be Friends

...
We don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again
I can tell that we are going to be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are going to be friends"

lexi wrote me a sweet email. lexis my soulmate. im so lucky i have so many soulmates to soak in a hot tub with for the rest of my life.
anyway,
after school i ran around like a little social butterfly because i love everyone so much!  im glad to see that i connect with people on deeper levels nowadays.  THEN i finished kill bill (almost) with ian and we watched that killer fight scene with the 5 6 7 8s. then i ate
then
I WENT TO DANCE
I WENT TO DANCE
AND I DANCED!
and im not even out of shape!  oh man besides pointe, im pretty much as good as jessie and kati!!  i cant believe it but it felt so good- i felt so beautiful, and all the pain just fades away when i feel like that.
then
I SANG!
i worked on my jazz fest songs ( i'm singing ""mabye this time"" ""sunny side of the street"" ""quelqu'un m'a dit"") with christine clevenger and becky pope and she really helped me a lot.
jessica streets told me she wants to win this year, and i heard her sing right before me and i hope she does.  she has a gorgeous jazz voice and shes really sweet.  i dont really care though- i jsut need some more performing.
im gonna miss sarah k, jessica and casey in trig cuz im switching periods and theyre dropping or switching to mckennon. they made math bearable at least!
today was splendid. :)
cu tomorrow lovelies
love,
sarah"

""...I'm thinking of giving an email I sent to sol about how much I love my daddy to my daddy for his b-day (saves money and i know he likes this stuff) but the truth is I don't think someone should be living not knowing how much they're loved.  Wow, life...this ""adventure"" of mine has been so much more than I bargained for... i feel so independent so much strogner and so much wiser but i need to not feel liek im alone which is where god comes through.  though i wont fall for the horrifying conservatism of THe Church i have my faith and i think everybody needs some.  in so many ways im really glad to still have two years left until university and moving out again.  its just  i still need more love and guidance from mommy and daddy.  though ive learned the logistics of living alone- ive realized how much i need their guidance now.  i really hope our relationship will be so much stronger when i come back and not only with them but with my brother as well!...""

""...I met cait and we had a little croissant then took off for the charled de gaulle airport.  i had never left from Gare Lille Europe!  Cait and i chilled and tried to map out the plan for Paris and meeting my mom.  We got to CDG in one hour and were like, where the hell do we go now?  We found a shuttle and went to terminal one where my moms plane was late and i was starting to hyperventilate because i was so nervous to see my mom again so i found the terminal and cait and i had an EARLY mroning beer and then my mom came!  I was like EEEEEE!  she was like ""hey beautiful!"" first impression?  She ws drugged!  So drugged it was hilarious for cait and i as we all stayed together taking the shuttle to jessies terminal in Air France.
We sat down so she could have coffee and i was telling how these girls were talking about joints in class and she was like ' well next time you can be like. MY MOM WAS AT WOODSTOCK.' out of nowhere an di was like, what does that have to do with marijuana mother?!  I got a big hug from jessie.  then we all took the RER train into Paris and walked to michelles appt. in montemartre where we relaxed and then walked around montemartre and the sacre couer then went to a little cafe where we got onion soup etc.  it was so weird how normal the atmosphere was for them but for me it was so much more odd. we went out for a beer that night and i was so suprised how little my mom said...well what could she do anyway?...""

""..and Jessie came in and wouldn't leave.  it was scary.  So i hid in the kitchen while cait got the hell out of there and jessie confronted mom and mom was angry and bawling and blaming things on me and I just kept telling myself
it's not your fault anymore...:"

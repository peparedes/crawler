"event","listening to Cat Power in the dark, bombarded by car horns and parking garage noises. flowered pajamas, t-shirt, hoodie, socks (two colors) and warm music. slow piano. sloppy slow vocals. ""we are creatures of the wind.""
I am swirling again with the whirpool of this dark haired storyteller. her piano fingers and nina simone cover massage like hot oil and i feel myself sliding into sleep. we are creatures of the wind. tonight is mardi gras in the dirty little town with the self driven cars. somewhere in a pretend village tuesday will be a holiday of food and celebration. fat tuesday's king cakes wheeled down avenue streets ringed with gold and green and purple and feathers, flames, beads, fat girls and ribbon. it's not a good influence on me here. 
The stones softened like ice cream, the dark haired girl is at it again. Exhuasted and pushing out breath rather than letting it go, she is hypnotizing me, singing words of brutal honesty. piano notes like kittens stepping; soft and tender. I never thought of a sunset as violent but now the words have found me out. thinking with a new idea i notice the way the sun tears at the sky; deep purple, blood red, the colors of bruised and bleeding. violence in the sky taken as beauty to those below. we are greedy watchers, standing beneathe the clouds, above us the fights play out. sun over takes earth and then loses strength to moon. the stars play flashbulb on the ring as the fighters take their turns attacking the sky. free admission."

"event","My mother was a Chinese trapeze artist 
In pre-war Paris 
Smuggling bombs for the underground. 
And she met my father 
At a fete in Aix-en-Provence. 
He was disguised as a Russian cadet 
in the employ of the Axis. 
And there in the half-light 
Of the provincial midnight 
To a lone concertina 
They drank in cantinas 
And toasted to Edith Piaf 
And the fall of the Reich. 

My sister was born in a hovel in Burgundy 
And left for the cattle 
But later was found by a communist 
Who'd deserted his ranks 
To follow his dream 
To start up a punk rock band in South Carolina. 
I get letters sometimes. 
They bought a plantation 
She weeds the tobacco 
He offends the nation 
And they write, ""Don't be a stranger, y'hear."" 
""Sincerely, your sister."" 

So my parents had me 
To the disgust of the prostitutes 
On a bed in a brothel. 
Surprisingly raised with tender care 
'Til the money got tight 
And they bet me away 
To a blind brigadier in a game 
Of high stakes canasta. 
But he made me a sailor 
On his brigadier ship fleet. 
I know every yardarm 
From main mast to jib sheet. 
But sometimes I long to be landlocked 
And to work in a bakery."

"event","The ship that bubbles across the ocean on the morning of the second baptism belongs to the uncle of the child being doused with the water. The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost, having splashed like sea-mist across the eyes of the wailing child, lay crumpled and dripping, exhausted as war-ravaged sailors on the splintered church stairs. Outside, the air is acrid and dissolving, as massive brown nets sit writhing with pink-shelled crab. The self-indulgent air is swallowing ships when Gabriel abandons his song and the end-times are signaled. Barrages of foghorns outside leave the water inside the church trembling."

Tomorrow I leave the country, bound for gold laden soil on the African coast. ""The salt mines are booby trapped,"" you said, but I kissed you with ferocity and neglected to hear. The space between your mouth and mine grows daily, as Africa looms like venom in the back of my mind. ""We'll meet on the continent in between"" the promise I left you with."

Now, 349 days later, backbent and sweating, I labor over the places your hands have been. Days, months, lifetimes ago, I pulled this shirt from cherry-colored water and ran my hands forcefully over the seams, a blind girl frantic for answers. Today hanging on the line it billowed against me, heavy and warm; the weight of the water much less than the weight of the sun. Your hands will be lilac for weeks."

"event","The expatriots across the street hung by their elbows every evening on a silvery rust stained pole strung carefully between the bookshelf and the garage door opener. Often at night, when the general sleepiness of our town had overtaken the rest of my neighbors, I would sit on the steps of my parents' front porch and watch them.  Some nights they swung like spider monkeys, chattering softly in the syllables, sounds, and patterns of holy Mohammad. Other nights they hung in total silence, eyes shut and bat-like for hours as I shredded blades of grass and guessed at the weather."

"event","* a calander recieved a year too late and I am prompted to confess a new idea across 25 hours of land. It is not a new idea but a new explanation, and one that, at the moment, seems fitting.

* Taking careful notice of the words i use most frequently, i realize that envy is indeed my deadliest sin. Envy and ignorance push me to the side of any road i have not travelled down myself. I am left feeling confused, ashamed, invisible, and held in plain view as parades of ghosts and heavy-weights amble easily here or there. They are going places that i am scared to go, following courses that i avoid and leaving a side of their mind full of doubt in a fishbasket on the side of the road. My mind is not extractable, or maybe, like the elephant man there is uneven growth; somewhere i was made wrong and the error leaves me sleepless. I have no fishbasket and instead i tote the doubt around, with dreams of death and sweeping water chasing raggedly behind.

* The roads i have not travelled lead to places like warm beds and rooms filled with smells of man and woman/boy and girl. They lead to chemical dreams, unthinkable ecstacy and lives where cats walk into walls. They travel to distant countries where ragged people sit and sell stones to clean white millionaires then shuffle wastedly back to their shacks at the end of the day. They lead to weddings and bachorlette parties, straight bars, frat houses, and to places where boys are gentle, think feelings, feel love. 

* Unexperience makes me an awkward child with nothing to say to the grown-up who tells me dirty secrets. Touch me here and don't tell anyone about it.

* I respond with resentment, denial and opinions based less on fact or real logic than violet flashes of what i am not. I am quick to answer and quick to point out the stupidity, indifference or disgust boiled up by the topic at hand. In my mind i am incredibly uncomfortable and struggling to hide my confusion, envy, tainted admiration, or a deep and violent wish to really understand. 

* Boys became a fixture in my circle of friends in early high school, as i struggled to find myself fresh out of a harrowing junior high. My best freinds were suddenly interested in them and counted them as pals, best friends, and objects of newfound desire. I was simply friends by association and felt every outing spent with them to be an invasion of what used to be my safest place. My only contact with them had been a devilish game of cat and mouse. I was the unpopular girl and they were the show-offs and assholes. They asked me on fake dates; laughed if i answered, laughed if i didn't. They yelled at me for being smart, and yelled at me for being dumb. They called me names, asked me to cheat, ignored me, and made me hate them with a passion. 

* Now my best friends had moved on. Won their approval. And thought them funny. They were charming to these pretty girls, and I felt like a fly on the wall in Dr. Jeckyll's lab. Night and day between the bully boys of jr. high and these sweet, exuberarant friends. 

* I felt very young.


* At home at 3 am i am sleepless for lack of something good to dream about. I extend my illegal pirate plank and scour the dingy corners of dimly lit porn folders, searching tirelessly to the one that looks most real. Amature, homemade, real. I want the thing that wiil show what lies at the end of the boygirl road where i have never stumbled across sweat drenched sheets and the smell of copulation. I find a file, two college kids screwing in front of a webcam. they are gentle with each other, take turns, hold tight. Nothing about it is violent or painful or wrapped up in power. They are equals and it gives me a new perspective. 
     
* Midnight. Sunday. A sweltering room and a mangled bean-filled frog lays beside me. i am looking at pictures of jack white. he sings with loretta so low i am straining to hear and i wonder what his nightlife is like. Drugs, possibly, and lots of them. Maybe not, but the thought is already rolling. I envy the rockers with the fuck everything attitudes, though i despise the abuses and worship that spring from that well. Drugs and musicians and artists and the bohemians who grow their hair long and smoke j's and sing songs. I am jealous of the abandon they allow themselves and i'm jealous of the solace they find in the end. I have danced with my mother to St. Judas, holding tight to my girlfriend, forgetting again and again who she was. I have made love to desert stomachs and my surfacing cd. I have made eye contact with stevie nicks and known how to climb through tunnels of pure sound. These are memories that will never leave me and things I have not worked to get. It is difficult for me to let go and surrender myself to something that i don't understand. If it can hurt me, i will think of the million ways i will die. If it is illegal, it will kill me and then kill my mother. I will be a catalyst for a million deaths.

* My actions have shut people out. 

At night i don't sleep for the same reasons my dad goes to therapy and my mom takes sleeping pills. Aparently, my brother is the only one in the family not weary of nightfall."

"event","Driving home my head leans a sloppy angle against the window and I stare up and out at the natural wonder I have come to associate so closely with Ohio. Birds. They travel swiftly in plump, fluttering billows, flying like patches of inverted sky; black dots against white.  On pole after pole they are stacked in heaping piles, severe silhouettes so solid and defined against the stark winter sky that I dismiss their sentience and regard them only as statues. In motion they are passionate and clever, quick, light, evasive, fleeting. They expand and contract, cavorting through the air with a unity reminiscent of fish in discovery channel commercials. But here, perched atop sliding telephone poles they are dour and ominous creatures; delicate wings closed tight around them, necks pleated inward and stiffened. They wear their light feathers like chain mail and swing heavily as the wire bows beneath their weight.

The duality of pain is an interesting, terrifying and unescapeable thing.
The pain of being apart from someone when being together hurts just as much.
Telling someone something painful that is just as damaging when still unknown.

I have never held them crying over the age of five. Grow up on me and you lose my understanding. My eyes don't well up. I put myself in that place (I have been there) and I feel it dull and throbbing in the context of her.

tomorrow: German, and I haven't studied much. The whole weekend has been angry, sad and achy. My head yesterday and today. Hormones or a bad disposition the culprit.

Soon we will be out and I will get a new start. We are both hurtling toward it with necks outstretched. We both need to get there first and this is not a race against each other."

"event","Go placidly amid the noise and haste,
and remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible without surrender
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
and listen to others,
even the dull and the ignorant;
they too have their story. 

Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. 

Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs;
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
many persons strive for high ideals;
and everywhere life is full of heroism. 

Be yourself.
Especially, do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love;
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
it is as perennial as the grass. 

Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline,
be gentle with yourself. 

You are a child of the universe,
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. 
Therefore be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be,
and whatever your labors and aspirations,
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. 

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy."

explaining myself after turning down an angsty rap song, i was suprised by the way i described this feeling.
Today i feel very close to god, I said. Introspective and filled to bursting with lyrics, poems and the steady pluck of a bass guitar, i discuss the sappy nature of these entries and make excuses for my embarrassingly good life. My brother agrees with me and quotes ani lyrics to express his political frustrations. 
--------------
Paul Simon is on repeat and i hear over and over the story of my uncle, a boxer, who died almost two years ago. It was january and I was laying in my bed. Megan was 3 cold minutes away making small talk with travellers and hot cups of coffee. After a few rings I answered, sleepy, and she threw the words at me like hot stones - heavy like the pants and shirts she tossed into the suitcase. I could hear her packing.
He was gone. My cousin was questionable. She was only 12 and i didn't know how to react. My mind was blank, wrapped in a million questions she didn't have time to answer.  I hung up and walked out to the couch. I stared out the window and watched the people get their coffee across the street. Things were moving and lightly the snow drifted down to melt on the wire just beyond my reach. Cars moved slowly by and their windshields soaked up snowflakes and the muffling spray of winter. My roommate slept soundless in the next room. Things kept moving. 
Driving with a very sick cat on my lap I held him and felt the furry warmth of his back against my arm. He had been gone for several days and now he was here, warmer than usual and confused by everything around him. It was unlike him and the vet was only 10 more minutes away. Crossing over Speedway by the rusted vacant lot and the cheapest gas in town I notice two boys on top of a dumpster, talking, watching traffic and spitting to make themselves cooler. I only glance and forget them once we're passed.  Later in the vet's office, Chelsie is listliss and I fall in love with him again. He purrs when i touch him despite his fever and the cancer they find running through his blood. They give me a few minutes and my mom and I cry and touch his head. He looks small and again I am jolted by how perfectly his orange eyes match his fur. I kiss his head, leave the room and  when they finally hand me the small white box it is warm on the bottom. 
Driving back home i pass those boys and the dumpster and they are spitting and hitting each other in the way they say boys do. They have not changed but I have. I have surrendered a part of myself to a cause i had no say in. The injustice stings me and the box on my lap grows heavier as it cools. 

Like my roommate at home nursing the ache from a tooth long gone, I feel intensely and I feel very heavily today. listening to the song that has brought me closer to my uncle than real life ever did, i am drawn to a line that leaves me asking questions.
'After changes upon changes, we are more or less the same
After changes, we are more or less the same.'"

"event","The telephone wires are always loaded and the birds always fly in clumps here. Melissa says it's because everything in Ohio is codependant and I don't know exactly what she means. The birds fly in ever shifting blocks and circles of wings and angles, and I would say there were nothing but blackbirds here, but I tell myself that can't be true. The sky is always grey and birds flying in swift packs lose all color and turn to shifting silhouhettes against that backdrop.  My thoughts linger on the heavy wires as I drive the increasingly familiar road. On more contemplative days I am reminded of Wallace Stevens and his thirteen ways of seeing, one by one. Lighter days bring three and twenty blackbird, crusts full of pie and horrible flying dinner. When i'm moody or the weather dark the word is Nevermore.  Bird on a wire. Baked in a pie. Flying in clumps. Stripped down to black. I enjoy these birds and there is a connection steadily building.

This weekend was spent in the land of the wild and wonderful. A prison tour and a much needed fire. I enjoyed that evening of flickering conversation,  hugs, and a heavy, star laden sky. The Now of the Tao was the thing i kept thinking about and I tried as hard as i could to freeze time and really live in each second. My parents have never been so beautiful and neither have I. The warmth from the fire mingled on the endges with the cool night air and I sat curled next to the nicest guy I know. That backyard swims with memories, and always they are heightened by the dance of a flame and a cool autumn breeze. It is one of my most treasured places. The back yard that cradled me as I learned to walk and jumped up to skin my knees when i rode my bike too fast. The back yard that has played host to birthday parties, picnics, snowball fights and close calls. It was the place where my cats and I were equally at home. We met there, on the grass, and played like best friends with nothing but time. I was an indian, a saint, a karate champ and a big sister. I was going to be a writer, a photographer, a singer and an athiest. I took to the woods my problems, my happiness and my cat on the day that he died. As i get older and move further and further away, I realize that the place where i first questioned God is now the most holy of spaces."

"event","the two girls i live with were raised in a conservative environment completely different from the household in which i was raised.
In one case, halloween was a holiday marked by reading the bible in the back room while trick or treaters roamed the streets looking for candy and plenty of it. Class halloween parties were off limits and the only costume allowed was that of the virgin mary.  I made references to Carrie and thought about what halloween meant to me. Scarecrows, cool weather, dark parties and glow in the dark paint. Holly and T.J. and Brookie and I crammed into someone's mom's mini-van, counting our candy and laughing when someone tripped over a hidden rock or jumped at makeshift ghosts in the trees. Next to Christmas, halloween was, and continues to be one of the most magical times of the year for me. So many memories of bobbing for apples at the school and parading around First Ward in whatever dance costume holly and I had that year. One year a princess, the next a clown. Last halloween I was a pirate. In college halloween took on a slightly different meaning. Pumpkins were still carved and seeds were still roasted, but in place of trick or treating we went dancing at the gay club down the street. 

My brother calls me a stark-raving lefty and although i don't know if I would go that far, I will definitely say that I'm a pro-abortion, pro-environment, pagan friendly, anti-NRA, anti-Bush, feminist lesbian who is pretty darned anti-organized religion and yet interested in the benefits of the eastern philosophies. My parents know every single one of those things about me, and willingly embrace all of them with the exception of perhaps two. (they just don't talk about my sexuality and they don't really understand the organized religion thing, but we haven't talked about it much.) I mainly credit my liberal views to my sexuality and the fact that i have, in some respect, been forced to seek support and validation in places most conservatives dare not tread. Feminists and liberals thought it was ok for me to be gay and they taught me that just because i was different didn't mean i should be ashamed. Naturally, I gravitated toward them, and all through my adolescence and now adult hood I have worked to be accepting and open-minded in return. In my opinion, it's silly to hide your children away from Harry Potter stories and I don't understand how celebrating Halloween could tear a child away from Jesus. I don't understand using religion to hate another group of people and i don't understand using laws created by men thousands of years ago to run the country I live in now. It just plain pisses me off that rich white men in washington get to tell me how i can or can not live my life. However, lunch time brought about an interesting view point (what i think i got from it was interesting anyway.)

The focal point of our lunchtime conversation was a hastily formulated theory dealing with personality differences between people raised in a conservative household versus...some other group of people. I wasn't really clear on what exactly the argument or intentions were, and a lot of the conversation was hard for me to follow. I think the point was made that kids raised in a conservative christian household often feel much more pressured to live up to a high standard because they feel they need to live up to their position as one of God's chosen people. Maybe. I figure i would feel extra pressure to validate my own existence if I didn't truly believe that my parents would love me unconditionally. I wasn't exactly raised by wolves, or hippies from woodstock, but I knew I was loved always. there wasn't a question and there was no room for doubt. If i messed up i was expected to learn from my mistake and then we all got over it. I can't imagine growing up any other way. I know that my parents aren't responsible for all of my openmindedness (and i certainly don't claim to be without my own predjudices or illogical fears/biases) Rather, as i said earlier, i believe I owe much of my attitude and beliefs to the fact that i'm gay, and as a result have often been considered an outsider myself. I do credit them with being accepting and flexible when it comes to my strong opinions, actions, and interests, but i also know that they are parents of a gay daughter and haven't mentioned it to anyone, including me. It is not an issue to the point that it is a non-issue. They didn't kick me out and they certainly didn't disown me, but they seem to do more to look the other way than to actually accept it. I'm lucky that they didn't shut me out of their lives, get angry, or try to force me to change. It certainly happens. 

There is a lot of pressure to be felt during a childhood in which God is forced upon you and a cookie-cutter mold is layed out for you to grow into. At least, I would imagine it to be that way. I feel lucky that I was raised the way I was raised, and wonder how different i would be today had I been straight. I also find my roommates' stories to be eye-opening and insightful, not only for the glimpses they offer into an ultra-conservative lifestyle far removed from my own, but also because of the ways i find myself reacting to them. I catch myself thinking that obviously those people need to loosen up and chill out, believing that they are the ones who need to rethink their beliefs. I am the one who is accepting, I think, but Anne was right when she said I just can't really see things from their point of view. I don't know if i'm being closed-minded when I discount their views, or if I'm just genuinely disagreeing. Sometimes when i talk to anne, it's difficult to differentiate. She says they honestly believe they are doing what's right and what they think will lead them to God. I guess i support everyone's journery to God, but not if it causes them to trample me or other people along the way.

the work day is almost over and I'm still not entirely sure what i am thinking. 

later on."

"event","today i read an article on cnn.com about some bratty little kids who, none too wisely, threw a bunch of rocks at a 500 pound bee hive built inside the walls of a Santa Ana apartment complex. Well over 120 THOUSAND bees swarmed out and four blocks of the surrounding neighborhood had to be shut down for hours and hours. 2 people were hospitalized and over 100 thousand pounds of dead bees were eventually scraped out of the hive by a professional beekeeper. It wasn't reported as to whether or not the kids who did the throwing were ever stung, but karmically speaking, one would guess they were. The kids in question, not surprisingly, were boys. In fact, immediately upon reading the biological sex of the children involved, i decided i wasn't suprised, and blamed the pure stupidity of the actions on the fact that the perpetrators were all little testosterone driven he-devils. After all, it doesn't take some sort of freakishly intelligent wunderkind to know that a 500 pound+ beehive is not quite the most suitable target for small, propelled objects. 
Apparently, though, this bunch of boys believed that it was. And of course, the stereotypical man-hating dyke in me is brimming with illogical and offensive comments. If you really need to take out that male aggression, why not just go beat up some little girl your age, or perhaps you could find a nice puppy with an ass ripe for the kicking. But no, you're right. When the testosterone in you just won't let you go home and play nice, it would probably make more sense to throw rocks at a big, swarming, massive, hive of bees. Right.
Testosterone, interesting enough, was also something i thought about quite a bit today after listening to an episode of npr's ""This American Life"" based soley around that most charming of hormones. Of particular import to me was the interview with a FTM trans guy (FTM = female to male, for those of you outside the GBLT community :-) who talked about the differences he experienced when recieving very high dosage testosterone shots. He said that within a day or two of recieving a show he would literally feel like a monster. All of these feelings that he hadn't felt ""before T"" as he put it, suddenly would rise to the surface and the world became a very different place. He said that before T he would often feel attracted to women and find them interesting, funny, intelligent and want to get to know them as a person, but after T he only wanted to have sex with them. He also said that he felt like everything was about sex all the time and it dominated every thought and action of his day. Cars turned him on in the same way women did and even the copy machine at work made him horny. He said that it was a change he hadn't ever anticipated, but it was a really intense look into the world of a real biological male. Because this FTM guy was in transition, he was being given a HUGE dose of testosterone, and one shot would typically supply him with twice the amount of T in a normal male body. So what he felt was, hopefully, a little dramatic, but that explains a little bit about why boys are so dumb. And of course i've had my run with high testosterone levels and i know it made me feel like i was living in a mean, angry, uncontrollable fog. I just don't like it when people excuse every act of ""grrrr, i'm a manly macho man""  by claiming it was hormones that made them do it. 

In other news, i finally got paid today and it is definitely cause for celebration. I also heard from carly (she's doing well out in the lovely land of cali) and she made me all happy and smiley (as usual.) I hope to go visit sometime, but of course, i have to get to denver first and foremost. hopefully we will have a good cup of coffe and get to snuggle a lot. :-) I'm so excited to take another plane ride. i just hope this one is on a big plane, not a tiny one. that was too scary.

I'm drinking a too hot cup of Good Earth tea and listening to a boy named Sufjan sing about his religion. The fan nealry overpowers his guitar, but his voice ultimately wins out. My tea is too sweet and delicious.

Saturday was spent with a stomach ache and I sat in my room learning why alcohol doesn't mix with my medicine. After driving to the blandly named coffee shop and being shut out early because shifts got mixed up, I turned out my lights and stole music. A mellow cover of the postal service and some of andrew bird's bowl of fire later, I was offered a candle and the mood was complete. The gaggle of girls downstairs played poker and their voices drifted up through the air vents like the smell of hot popcorn. On the trip to brush my teeth the boy could be heard and I was happy i'd stayed in my room. It's always an invasion when they come around. 

I spent today surrounded by surrogate friends and rollercoasters i hadn't met before. I missed my best friend and, yes mom...i missed you too. I am clearly a creature of habit.

"event","Fifteen minutes left in the lunch break and jazzy music that doesn't fit my mood. I love the way it sounds slipping softly out of low-quality speakers. Some music is meant to be listened to like this. From a distance, quietly, drifting from a room that no one's in, winding itself towards the ears from behind a wall and through a doorway. It echoes the emptiness of the room with the upbeat steady rhythm of soft-brushed drums and brass in a way no other music could. Billie's voice says she is dead and gone, and the idea reverberates so strongly i can't imagine her ever being alive. For me, it is empty music in only the finest sense of the words. Hard to explain.

life in Ohio is flat like the landscape. I work a steady schedule and still don't sleep at night. Today the weather is cool and I brought a can of soup to eat midday. Now there's a sickness and the heavy feeling of too much. 
Daytime i do a lot of listening and at night i watch my fish and think. I know i'm here to do good things, but i can't shake the feeling of living for the future. The eastern philosophies say to live in the present and celebrate each moment of the now. I try to do that, but I miss Megan so much that I'm really only biding my time. What is going on now and here is killing time until i can see her and talk with her face to face. i do love my new roommates, but this is my first time away from my home and my friends. Occasionally, an ani lyric or two creeps into my mind, mainly when I'm alone or feeling confused by one of my housemates. thus far, this has been the most suitable :

I don't want to play for you anymore
show me what you can do
tell me what you're here for
I want my old friends
I want my old face
I want my old mind
fuck this time and place

I have pulled myself out of the comfort zone and set myself on edge. Now I'm here and the adjustments have begun. My biggest problems thus far have been:
a.) disorientation to an insane degree and
b.) a constant, overwhelming sense of inadequacy and self-doubt. 

I am not an organized person and I am not often logical. I try to be more like my brother, but my mind doesn't work that way. I'm ok with this and I'm 23, i've obviously made it this far. I'm still here and I am in a position and place in my life that took some effort and brain power to get to. The self-doubt is nothing new. Unfortunately, it comes as naturally to me as language or breathing.  The inadequacy also isn't a new thing. It's the fact that I seem to give myself no reprieve that is becoming so troublesome. I live with two very organized, motivated, intelligent people. 

the rules of meditation say that it's all in the way you think about things. One of the goals for the year is to change the thought pattern and make myself more amanda-friendly. Another is to seek God in every way i can, without compromising myself or believing without question. 
Listening to a late night story about a brother and conservativism I am suprised by a trip into a life I haven't ever known. This is what i love about it. The girl says pragmatic a lot and I have only a hazy definition in my mind. I'm sleepy and tomorrow i will look it up. So i do.
Pragmatic : Dealing or concerned with facts or actual occurrences; practical. 
I feel like that defines them also. 
I feel like she has depth. I imagine hallmark greeting cards of proms and dates and movies and college life.  So much different than my own experience, although logic tells me it can't all be true.  She was raised in a conservative household, and can't even tell them about me. Thankfully, the delta delta delta sticker belies her willingness to learn and empathize.  So far she is the best friend i have here and I hope it continues. She has a lot to offer and her readiness to open her eyes is refereshing. 

Megan is past her limit of daytime minutes which means no talking until after 7. Her 7 is my 9 and it will make the day seem longer. It's ok, though. Internet will hopefully improve the rate of communication. I am often at my best via  text anyway. 

Tonight, the arcade and a flyer to make. I need to get my car looked at, and i need to sign up for a graphics class.
Funny that i hated graphic design so much in school and now i'm here doing it. Page layout seems different somehow and all I can say is thank God for Scott and his patience with me and that god damn Nazi book. If i wouldn't have learned InDesign then, i don't know what i would be doing now. Floundering, i guess.  I wish they were coming up this weekend. I miss politics and late night talks over pot and alcohol. I wonder how the kittens are doing?

on tv there is talk of a Yeti. The hotel air is cool around my head but the footprints on TV distract even my body from noticing. They are as big as my arm and my brain doesn't know what to think. the man on tv is gruff with a brown beard that makes me dislike him. he swears he saw the Yeti while hunting and it scared him so bad that he backed up against a tree and wet himself. I will never forget that detail. The sunlight behind the curtains was so bright, the flimsy windows and door had to fight to hold back the heat. I was scared to leave the hotel room for 2 days to follow.
------

in the daytime my dad is gone and in evening we go out to dinner. During the day mom entertains us with long walks and fast-food playgrounds. my brother never wants to play on the purple Grimace see-saws or climb on the fiberglass Ronald McDonald. It's too hot to even touch the slide and i end up scooting down on my feet in a sticky descent. We end up walking down the median of the highway, a woman in her 30's and two under 10 children. We return to the hotel exhausted, walked out and burnt from slides and the sun.
------

today i am 23 years old. Occasionally I find myself standing over a bathroom sink surrounded by hair and disappointment. I watch the faucet run and flash back to 7th grade. I have never been my own favorite person, rather my own worst enemy. In three days i will march for women's rights, harboring a secret envy of pencil thin beauties.

1989. My best friend storms upstairs and tells my mom she wants to go home. She doesn't like to play with me because i always want to play with the boys. I like football and playing in the woods. She is uncoordinated and scared of Indians in the trees. We are still best friends. Today she plays with boys and I spend my days placing them on islands."

"event","the other day i bought a roll of burlap for an art project.
the burlap came rolled around a non-descript cardboard square that they wouldn't let me keep.
It was 25 yards long and i bought the whole thing
The white rectangular sticker on the front announced that it was rolled by Mike Smith. 
Warhol was right. This was his 15 minutes.
Mike Smith.
The idea of him caught me off guard. Such a boring name for a boring job. 
Mike Smith.
Of medium height and thin with giant brown glasses and a bald spot he tries hard to cover. His burlap scratched arms are his only peculiarity, prompting stares and incorrect assumptions from neighbors and grocery store clerks. They never ask and he never answers. He is dismal for lack of a love life and buys just enough to survive on. The tiny white label is his lifeboat from anonymity. 
His hours are spent rolling fabric onto non-descript cardboard and brushing his hands over an orange and white tabby named Tail. She sleeps in the square spot of sunlight that falls through his window and dreams about rabbits as he watches the minutes and burlap pass slowly. He never forgets to feed her and remembers the day he found her curled like a cheese doodle outside of the factory. He bundled her into his too thin coat and watched her drink a pint of whole milk on his kitchen floor. His only day absent from work.
Now, as he sits on the grey metal stool he thinks of her in the sunlight and picks at his nails. The air in the factory is dim, heavy with sweat and strings of loose fabric. Two years ago they gave him a mask to protect his lungs, but it fits too snugly and makes his breath too hot against his lips. He doesn't wear it over his face, but instead stretches the string below his ears, the cottonwhite dome of the mask resting over his bald spot - a makeshift yarmulke. He will leave this place in search of the sun, an impression of string on his ears and the sensation of warmth on his lips."

"event","the plant is called a Sedum morganianum and is better known as Burro's Tail. It's a beautiful succulent that is somewhat slow growing and dangerously brittle. 
Today i tied a cup to a reel of kite string and dangled it outside the window for at least 20 minutes trying to scrape up even one little strand of my beautiful little plant. The wind was too strong, and even with a marble taped to the inside of the cup it flew like a box kite into the building again and again and I was completely unable to gather my fallen friend. I guess i will have to sneak a strand here and there from the moose, but i almost feel guilty for doing so. Knowing how long it must have taken to dangle gracefully the way it does, i hate to chop pieces off in such greedy self-interest.  i know it was a ghost that picked that plant up and slyly scooted it away while we were in the other room enjoying each other and the lightening. I know we didn't hear it thump down with the crash of a dirt laden pot because it was gently strewn about by the third inhabitant of this apartment. It doesn't bother me to have a ghost, it bothers me to know that it didn't like my Sedum morganianum (better known as Burro's Tail.) That plant couldn't have done it any harm.

i am a member of biglm.
i was not sure how to get this message out so i just replied to this
one. on sunday night, 3/1, i along with two other friends were attcked
outside of the liquid lounge. our assailents attacked us because we
are gay. as they puched us they called us faggots. after leaving they
returned , punched me again and then shoved us down- continued to kick
us saying: ""you fucking faggots- this is our town"" i now, thanks to
these three guys have two fractures in my face, two black eyes, in
addition to a swollen face. The other guys involved were also injured-
one has a broken nose- the other a damaged ear. i am kind of at a
loss. the guys who did this to us were questionned that night at the
scene but were not arrested. I along with one of the other guys who
was injured filed complaints with the city of morgantown police
department. nothing has been done yet. on thursday more witnesses are
going to submit statements. if everything does go through the guys
will be charged with battery. when i asked if there were any
ordinances against hatecrimes due to homosexuality the officer said
yes, but it was very difficult to prove and requires approval from his
supervisor. if any one can contact me will some help on what to do i
would be very appreciative. 



It doesn't make sense. I guess alcohol mixed with too much testosterone and ignorance can go a long way towards hurting alot of other people. My friends have suddenly changed their routines...started walking in pairs, staying in, etc.  We joked about it on the way home from the club tonight, girl arms draped over girl shoulders and talk of a california wedding in the air. It really wasn't funny though... we were leaving in a group because two of the girls had a long way to walk and didn't want to go it alone. The kid with the bashed up face sat across from us at the club tonight. His hair looked cute, but his eyes didn't. Puffy and red doesn't look good on anyone."

"event","the shadows this morning crawled like stretch marks across a pale yellow ground hardened by frost. The cool blue shadows were so long that i found my hands feeling useless for lack of a camera and film. Morning and evening are the best times for photos, to capture the world in it's most candid moments of loss and renewel. Everything cycles; the planets, the stars. I am my grandfather, a slave woman, a priestess; the lives my waking mind doesn't rememeber and my dreams can't forget. Last night i talked too much and asked silly questions when i should have been sleeping. I ended up with no answers and a too tired body this morning, barely able to climb out of bed. The girl on the cycle beside me said her stomach was caving in. She knew it wasn't really but it felt like it just the same. I knew the feeling. I tried to read but my mind was somewhere else and I didn't feel Toni deserved that. Neither did Denver, Beloved, Sethe or even Paul D. I closed the book with a 5 cent Valentine marking my spot and flipped it over to cover the clock. I missed the people inside while i was away, but they deserved more attention than i could devote with such vacancy."

"event","listening to Cat Power in the dark, bombarded by car horns and parking garage noises. flowered pajamas, t-shirt, hoodie, socks (two colors) and warm music. slow piano. sloppy slow vocals. ""we are creatures of the wind.""
I am swirling again with the whirpool of this dark haired storyteller. her piano fingers and nina simone cover massage like hot oil and i feel myself sliding into sleep.  we are creatures of the wind.  tonight is mardi gras in the dirty little town with the self driven cars. somewhere in a pretend village tuesday will be a holiday of food and celebration. fat tuesday's king cakes wheeled down avenue streets ringed with gold and green and purple and feathers, flames, beads, fat girls and ribbon. it's not a good influence on me here. 
The stones softened like ice cream, the dark haired girl is at it again. Exhuasted and pushing out breath rather than letting it go, she is hypnotizing me, singing words of brutal honesty. piano notes like kittens stepping; soft and tender. I never thought of a sunset as violent but now the words have found me out. thinking with a new idea i notice the way the sun tears at the sky; deep purple, blood red, the colors of bruised and bleeding. violence in the sky taken as beauty to those below. we are greedy watchers, standing beneathe the clouds, above us the fights play out. sun over takes earth and then loses strength to moon. the stars play flashbulb on the ring as the fighters take their turns attacking the sky. free admission."

"event","On a Sunday morning sidewalk, 
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned. 
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone. 
And there's nothing short a' dying 
That's half as lonesome as the sound 
Of the sleeping city sidewalk 
And Sunday morning coming down."

"event","Yeah so it's been a while since i've last updated.... I almost updated when i was in school in Australia, but the teacher kinda kicked us off the compy's. Oh well.
Hmm... Soo much has happened too much to tell all in fact. 
I went to Australia and New Zealand, and it was amazing. I'd go back in a heartbeat! I met some amazing people who i LOVE to death. And i saw and did some amazing things. the only word that can sum up my trip is A-MAZE-ZING and for those of you that didn't get it...AMAZING!!

But it feels good to be back, even though i cried a lot that i had to leave everyone I still <3 my home. I was soo excited that my two favorite people were there at the airport for me...Courtney and Amanda!

My grandma's in town so i've been spending more time at home. But I got to go to see my dear Nick today! 
Tomorrow I'm going to see Nicki!! I'm excited! 

Alright dears... I'm going to bed now, so Sweet Dreams. 
Much Love <3

"event","Hmm.......I was back on the road by thursday, which was a surprise, kinda.

Friday I had to work and then i went over to woody's and hung out with him and amanda. Then I took my car home and woody took us back to his house. Then we went and played taxi for some kids and took the car back to woody's house. We walked to brian's and hung out for a while. Nothing too memorable. Then we took a cab to amanda's and I threw up out of nowhere. I wasn't even drinking or anything, and i don't think i am sick, it was just random. Oh well. Then we watched texas chainsaw but i feel asleep after like 20 mins and they didn't go to bed for another 2 hours lol.

Saturday I had to work and then after work i went to amanda's. Woody ran from us so we spent the night trying to find him. We went to Celia's house for a while. I feel bad for Crystal....this girl's a stupid hoebag and punched her b/c she thought Crystal was talking about her but she wasn't or something. Oh well. Then i had to pick up my sister and this chick who i don't know, but i do know that i hate her. No not hate, despise. She's scummy. Then i got chinese food with alex and trevor and amanda. It was super amazing. That's right super amazing. Then i came home and woody called me and we made plans to go to amanda's really early in the morning (11)

This brings us to Today..... I picked woody up and we went to amanda's. (Keep in mind she's not aware of us coming over) We called like 40 times and then knocked on the door for 5 mins. Then we had the idea to throw pine cones at her window. how romantic. She woke up terrified wondering what the hell was going on. Then we hung out for a while and  I went to work. After work i went to woody's house and then to my house. After we went to Amanda's house and then got nick and came to my house for some quality trampoline time. I cherish those moments lol. Then i took them all home and here i am. i think i'm going to get going and read a little. Adios.
Much Love

We went to trevor's house and had a bonfire. saturday was alright not as fun though. I hung out with amanda and nick and steve and dave for a while. Saw katelyn the <3 of my life! I came home at like 12 15 and dave and phil and katelyn <3 were there with my sister. So i hung out with those kids and i drove phil home at like 2 am. Sunday was mommy's day. We went to a park with a lighthouse and went out for ice cream. then we came home and i went to my grandma's for a while. then i had to come home and i went to nick's for a while becuase he was upset, but it's okay now! 
I'm grounded from my car b/c of an incident that happened yesterday. And i've been thinking how i'm not proud of how i act to my family lately. I got my car taken away because of it. and i really want to change, ot because of the car, because i don't like it. I want to be happy and nice to everyone.
Oh well....that's about it....<3"

Last weekend was the greatest! Friday- i took my sister and crystal to sam and trevor's and then i went to woody's with brian amanda and zach. Singing and dancing in the kitchen was beautiful. Then i left at about 12. 

I had to work on saturday but after i got amanda and crystal. Then i dropped crystal off at sam and trevor's. We went to woody's dad's and then to tom pharrel's house. That was really fun. Then we went to Sam and trevor's and we had to sneak around their mom because she didn't want people over. Then levi and joe showed up. Max and woody were ready to bust caps. Max-i don't think you read lj, but if you do this is for you- thanks for being willing to kick ass for me, i just didn't want you to get in trouble. thanks! Then woody ""played cool"" with playskool. haha Then brian and woody and amanda stayed the night and my dad fixed his finger with a tampon wrapper. He's so crafty  lol. 
sunday-i got my nails done with amanda from work. Then we went to work. After work i hung out with nick for a lil while and then came home.

Today- I hung out with amanda, woody, brian and nick for a while,then i went to nick's house and hung out. I worked out on the gazelle for a while.

Alright that's about it. can't wait for my next adventure. <3

"event","So today.. I went to my meeting for Australia. That went well i guess, i was frickin freezing though. Then i went to the SPCA with my mom and dad. I was so excited. I have three dogs on my mind, we put two on hold so that Sofie can meet them. On dog that we didn't put on hold but we walked her around was beautiful. Her name was Reese, she was a pit bull mix. But she was soo sweet and her markings made her look like a tiger almost. The other two dogs were 6 month old border collie mixes. they are brother and sister and so cute and calm. They are a lil shy though, but that might be because they had just gotten off of the truck from being transfered from W. Virginia. I don't want to get one without the other though, because they are so close to each other. My mom has names picked out for them but they aren't official...George and Gracie. I liked gracie but i don't know about george lol. Well i'm about to figure out what courtney is up to.....hopefully drive in tonight...call me..870-0906!
Much Love

"event","Oh man. So last night kristi and i drove around and then went to will's house Then they all came to my house. They were drinking, i wasn't. My sister scared us by pulling in. We thought it was my mommy and daddy. Then mandy wrestled will. That was funny. No one really won because they hit their heads so hard. I guess a rematch will be necessary. Mandy tried to wrestle mike but he wouldn't. That would have been interesting. Then woody decided to find as much change in my house as possible. I think he left with like 5 dollars in change in his pockets. I made pizza pockets! I love them! Then i made frankie one too. Will was trying to make out with kristi she was hesitant, but we all know she wanted to. lol....Then they left and kristi and I watched the weirdest movie ever...The Forgotten. AHH. Sleep came next.
Today..kristi and i woke up at 8:40...i dropped off kristi and went to frankie's house. Frankie refused to come with, so woody and i headed to B-lo to get my dear amanda! My car kept making weird movements, it's like it had hydrolics, but it doesn't. Then when i was getting off the thruway the wheel stopped turning and the brakes didn't work. Then the car stalled. I restarted it and all was well. We got mildly lost. But we found amanda!! Then i dropped them off and here i am. I think i'm going to take a shower and go to work. Much love!

I'm really glad we've gotten to be such good friends! You're a doll. Then this morning we went to the doctors office and saw Frankie there! I got a red Safe-T-Pop! Those are my fav! Then we went to woody's house and watched cartoons. Then we had a shower fest. And by that i don't mean we all showered together! Apparently my shower doesn't have enough room to move around in'. Then we picekd up frankie and came back home. We had a straight up FIGHT CLUB in my living room. Woody and Frankie both fought my sister in wrestling. And may i say, they got their asses kicked by a little 14 yr old girl. Although i might add my sister's a beast. Then we went to KFC and big surprise they are out of chicken. HOW THE HELL DO YOU FUN OUT OF CHICKEN AT KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN!!?? Oh well. Then Amanda had to go to B-Lo, so frankie, woody and i got lacy and went to the blvd. mall! I got a cute shirt and shoes!! :) 
Omg..i almost forgot...when i was pulling out of tom's driveway there was suddenly this guy behind my car and i freaked out and drove away......he showed up out of nowhere and then starting running after i pulled away?? It was creepy. Then he told me some story about a ghost, but i think he was making that up lol.

okay, here's where i start to have problems, I didn't realize we had a problem, but apparently you did. You can tell me, not my mom or lj. I tried to call over and over, i guess it's my fault when you don't answer the phone?!?    
Oh well call me and we can talk about it i guess? 

As for now i'm sitting here.....I might go to bed. I don't know. Sleep is needed. 
Tomorrow......work...later..lacrosse....later???

I love lacrosse. It's so fun. My legs are killing me, but i love it. I'm actually getting kinda good at it too, which is cool. I'm really happy with my life right now. I love my friends, all 5 wheels (sorry courtney!!) I just am very happy with the way things have been going for me. And i know you are going to make fun of me for this if you read it, but I'm happy with how things with Frankie have been going! I'm just happy. 

Now that i'm done being a dyke.....I finally get to have a real weekend. I only work for like 2 hours both saturday and sunday....serious cut in the paycheck, but it is still great to finally have time to do something during the day on the weekend. It will be the first time this has happened since october!!!! I hope i have fun. 

I really really want to go see Jimmy Eat World, they are my favorite band ever, and their music has helped me out a lot with so many of my problems. As stupid as that sounds, it's true, they are amazing.

Alright that's all i have to say... Much love!

That's always <FONT color=#339999 size=6>fun. </FONT>One day we went with <FONT color=#ff0000 size=6>tom</FONT> and his friends and then we went again with my cousin <FONT color=#009900>matt</FONT>, <FONT color=#33ccff>dan, </FONT><FONT color=#cc66cc>nikki, </FONT>and <FONT color=#333399>nel</FONT>.

<P><FONT color=#c0c0c0>&nbsp;I got to go see <FONT color=#33ff33>my aunt</FONT> who was diagnosed with <U><FONT color=#ff0000>lukemia</FONT></U> about a week ago. I was so glad to see her.

"event","I didn't get much sleep last night, thanks to Nichole. Oh well, who needs sleep anyways?

I called this girl i work with who may need a ride like 4 times, and she wasn't home...her parents said she's going to need a ride. So, i drove out to Gasport to get her...and she never came home last night, so i had to go to work and tell them that i dont know where she is and if she's intending on showing up for the nest party. So i had to work the first party alone, then Lacy came and saved me and helped with the second party. I hate how people ask you to do things for them that are completely out of your way, and then don't have the sense or responsibility to even be there. Whatever, i was there when i was supposed to be, i guess that's all that's important. 

I'm trying to get used to this new ""life"" of not doing something with your significant other just about every day. It's different, I actually have time to do things i want to do..sometimes too much time. I get to see Nkki a lot more..which is awesome..i don't know what i'd do without her. I've put all of the time i can into work and raising money for Austraila. That's good though, i need to get there in the worst way. lol Oh well i guess that's all. Much love......Until we meet again, xokatexo"

Then we went bottle collecting.......made about 31.00 because we only collected for a half hour. 
Then we went shopping and more shopping.........I bought a second holly hop dress. lol. Picked Nikki back up at her house after she got home from work. We went tanning........and found out that I have a new ""boyfriend""........its funny how the FAKE word travels. oh well no reason to worry. 
Until another time...........oh yeah Nikki is the greatest person alive. (who is secretly dating my cousin)"

"event","All the emotions we once felt,
Ran down the drain along with my heart.
Now long after all the fights.
Long after the tears.
After the forgotten heartaches.
You have come back into my life.
You enter as if you're welcomed.
You once had the whole me,
You were my everything.
I gave you everything.

The final goodbye,
Was difficult.
To see you happy.
Even with the tears that rolled onto my cheeks,
You ignored the way i clutched your hand, 
How I embraced that hug,
Made the last kiss last.

Thanks for the way you acted as if it was nothing.
Acting like I meant nothing.
Everything I did for you or gave you,
That was nothing.
You made me feel so loved.
So used.
So cheap.

The saddest thing of all, 
I think i still love you.
Your eyes still make me drink all of your posion.
That smile,
Make me melt the ice sheild covering my heart.
I feel that deep burning of fire in my heart.
The fire that once burned for you.

Temptations are all around me.
Their embracing me in that ugly way they do.
Contemplating what  I want from you,
What I want out of anything.
Do I want the same shit.
Its not that  I wasnt happy,
(I would be lying if I said I wasnt.)
It's just so hard to want to subject myself to the pain I'll suffer if this doesn't work out.

I love you so much,
That I'd do anything.
I just want you to love me too.
For once,
Just once.

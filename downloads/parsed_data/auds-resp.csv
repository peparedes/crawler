"event","I was a little apprehensive to write about this dream... but its really itching at me so I decided to choose the journal with the least amount of readership... and one that isn't wired to stalkerbook.

So interestingly enough I have had a dream quite similar to this in high school, a little different... a little less intense... and a different ... mentor I guess you would say?

So my dream is I'm getting up early for today... I guess I actually skipped work.. and it was actually semi decent weather outside... unfortunately.. I was headed to Stephen's class to take a test (the same test I'm actually taking today)... I was headed straight there until Dave Swen. stopped me in the street right outside of the student center.. and he asks ""Audrey do you have a few moments so we can talk""  so I.. thinking it was AFRC related say ""Sure""  He immediately starts talking... saying he's worried and he brought some people to talk to me.  These two guys in semi-casual clothes with name tags... but not fancy name tags... but sticker ones... and Dave tells me ""I know what you have been doing...""  I start thinking when the last time I had done it... In my dream.. I dreamt (yes i dreamed in a dream) that I had done it in some sort of office place.. but I looked at my arms and saw nothing... I started to panic some... thinking that something like this would get me kicked out of everything... The two blockheads start asking me questions and have this device and are running it along my skin while also checking my pulse.. to see if I get some sort of through or something.. I keep thinking that I'm so freaking nervous that the thing is making my heart race... this is where the dream gets a little sketchy and the next thing I know the guy is taking me to the clinic (which sucks)... and then I'm not sure what happens... all I know is that the whole time i was nervous cause I didn't think Stephen would let me makeup the test...

very confusing dream but I needed to write it down... I still feel weird about it...but what can you do....  The one in high school was mostly just my physics teacher talking to me about it... but I find both of these men high on my list of good people... so who knows...

"event","I sit in the place that gives me chills... and i write... nonsensical words... nonstop....silliness... gazing gradient gargantuan giants...

ok thats sorta out of my system

So i decided its update time... due to the fact I want to look like I am accomplishing something... when in reality.. I am not.

So I feel like this week will be busy again... but not kill me busy like last week... I still need to get my hands upon something that will help me organize my life... like a personal agenda... boo to being unorganized... poor and unorganized...I just need to start writing things on my hand again... like the good ol high school days...but alas... i rarely carry a pen... and if i do it usually ends up exploding in my sac a dos... c'est la vie...

Speaking of french.. I feel like my mind is severely crowded with french... french... and more french... this is the most work I have done in french in a long time... I guess having two 3or4xxx classes doesnt help... but whatever.. its still good... just a lot more work than I am used to... Plus its hard enough when I prioritize biology as my number 1... and choosing between the two... then french... eeeech... then all the non school... schooly extracurricular things.... maaaaaaaaan... plus figuring out what I want to do next year... I'm stuck inbetween grad school and the peace corps... both having several pros... and a few cons... its the decision thats the hardest thing... and piecing my life together... So much... so many feelings... gahhhhhhhhhh

but this newest option has been interesting me more and more each time i think about it, but I am trying to arrange a visit to find out for sure.  It would doing some more duck nesting research... which would be really interesting... haha the con you ask?  Living in the twin cities... seriously... morris has made me wimped out on living in the big city.. Im spoiled in this small town atmosphere....BOO

but... what do you do... So I'm continuing to work on my Peace Corps application while also arranging meetings with different grad school professors to try to get grad school information.  This probably means I should also start thinking about signing up for the GRE...


Matt says its time to learn... I guess I am done here... but... someday we can talk again... maybe face to face...  you can find me in the ol TMC"

"event","I've been an emotional nightmare since school started that I haven't found it in me to update.  I am finally feeling the need to become independent again.  I decided to stop taking any sort of shit from customers at work, any sort of shit from other people... and I just plan to live contently?

Anyways

So school has started and I feel more busy than I could have imagined.  I'm working about 20 hours a week and did receive the chair position on the committee I am on.  I finished/presented my senior seminar two weeks ago, and I feel happy that that stress is not in my life anymore.  But for some reason I feel that I haven't really found any extra time during the week.  I fell a little behind in French Class but I am slowly catching up.

I am enjoying the new living situation, though I currently never seem to be home except for on weekends... and it still seems hard to see the roomies. 

I haven't been able to volunteer as much as I would like because I have been so busy (which is no excuse, but what can you do?) 

Ever since school started I have been wanting to go home and see friends and family.  Unfortunately I still have to wait another 20 days until I can do that.  But it will be a glorious time when it does happen.  I am just hoping we don't get a freak snowstorm at that time to delay my trip home.  Luckily enough there have been enough activities every weekend to keep my mind off of home.  This weekend is the jazz concerts, next weekend is HomeKUMMing concert, weekend after that I should be headed home!

This past Friday, I went to SDSU to visit with a professor there about grad school.  Unfortunately her research focuses on soybeans and I would prefer other types of ecology.  This sort of changes my plans for next year.
Sara has someone I can talk to at the UM tc about duck research... Or the Peace Corps (my application is finished except for a few essays), or an apprenticeship to teach English in France, or find some company that will pay for culinary school for me if I promise to work for them.

So right now I am lost, lost, lost

I don't even know how to write about the rest.  I've talked with a few friends about stuff.  But I don't know... suck it up or something?

Anyways I suppose I should study some since I have both my PLant Bio and Vert Nat Hist tests this week, Plus a translation

Followed by a paper on some topic of french medieval history... due next week....\

So I am alive, and I guess that counts for something..."

I need to have more motivation...


Other than that.. Im kinda trying to swim through this week... with my eyes half shut.... Im hoping to make it to the end... with very little scarring...

"event","well as soon as break is about to end.. it finally gets interesting...


but that's supposed to happen...

I got to work two weeks at good ol wendys... which was horrible the first week, working with a manager that is hypocritical and rips people apart for little things that are ridiculous... So I was not happy to be back...But I noticed I got another raise... Money is a hard thing to judge by... you don't want to be greedy... and you want to be able to pay the bills and live comfortably.. the question is.. is it worth it?

so Im still pondering the question and trying to figure out how this summer will be working for me....

but I really don't want to think about that now...

I've gone through so many thought processes this break... Some I will never understand.. and some I qill just choose to not understand....

But I feel like the conclusion is what I want... its like everything I had was already there... it just needed to be polished up a bit... I can't necessarily say I feel stupid... i didn't do anything..... its just the thought I suppose...


But it feels good to know...

I have changed a lot....

my first email account... has over 700 unread messages... granted most of it is spam... and it has accumulated to the extreme because of my neglect to delete things..I just have this feeling to delete it... cut out a fragment of an old self that doesn't exist anymore...but I have messages in there since the beginning... I have saved emails of conversations with friends... emails with a friend that made a small impact in my life who i never speak to anymore...emails from my father that I could just never get around to deleting...

so who knows if I will ever get rid of it... I just have this hard time with getting rid of things like that...

I rarely read the old messages... but there has been a few times.. when falling back on them has helped me grow...

haha plus Im waiting for an email from myself that comes at 2050? I think... a time capsule sort of thing.. I should have made a copy for myself.. so i could read it now.. But i guess there's no fun in that when i keep reminding myself about myself from a couple years back... (annoying repetition)

AHHH I just feel completely different now....


good... bad?  WHo knows... its just one of those things that you can't help but notice...

I sometimes feel that maybe my friends don't like the different me... maybe they don't notice...

I feel it... and sometimes Im not sure if I like it...

just this break ive grown up.. and moved on from things that were weighing me down... it feels good.. but I still find the future scary... maybe scarier than before...

but that could be because its one day closer..."

Infamous Wendys... celebrated 4 year anniversary.. I really gotta get out of there

Road trip to cornucopia wisc (it was almost just for the heck of it)

Im a complicated person... I mean who isnt... Im not cunning or sly... just shy... yet at the same time a people pleaser...

i screw up... I mean who doesnt... I screw up a lot

and If i could apologize.. I would... and Im not saying I won't... its more that Im afraid that you will act as if its nothing... or just wonder ""what the hell is this...and why""

and while apologizing to a couple of people who read this.. and not actually to you doesn't guarantee that I won't still wonder...

Im somehow hope that like some kind of time capsule you might just maybe take a glance at this... see that while you probably didn't care about my apology... i still feel bad for my ""suckiness"" as a person... an aquaintance... 

but what do you do...


so without embarrassment I apologize... probably only one of my friends will maybe understand who this pertains to... but whatever...

two more years of college... and those couple moments of mystery freshman year I guess will make for interesting questions in the future

done"

these girls are hilarious... and tomorrow is the championship game...

I know its kinda odd for me to coach a team

""BUT AUDREY YOUVE ONLY PLAYED ONE YEAR OF SOFTBALL WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE GAME""

well.. that doesnt matter... Im able to read (hard to believe I know) and I like to have fun

and thats all these girls need... most of these girls are 17-18 and are the greatest bunch of kids to hang out with...The kids are constantly yelling anchorman quotes at me... one girl refuses to call me anything except coach.. they like to tease me when I ask them about certain rules...

but seriously the best girls I have ever coached (the only... but I think this group will be hard to beat)

after our game today... which was a little too easy... we cheered on for the team we prefered to play against in the championship... I couldnt stay to watch the end.. but I was very excited to see that they won... because no one likes to play against attitude...so we cheered our little hearts out... and we got into the attitude-rific team's head...  but it was all fair


so anyways.. I guess the purpose of this bulky post is that tomorrow is the championship... and Im excited... Im not even playing.. but Im excited for my girls... for almost everyone on this team this will be their last game of their community rec experience.. .and I hope its fun


so everyone grab a few sunflower seeds... and Play Ball"

I leave for Fargo Monday morning.... it will be a nice 6 hour drive across state.... I will be going with Bee but because of certain circumstances we will be travelling separate cars... which only means a long ride... but I guess Im used to it... sort of... anywho I got to watch some World Cup but it only makes me miss soccer more... SUCK... I got two cds today because I sadly forgot the majority of the cds I listen to in Motown....So I got an older slackers cd... and I got the new mason jennings cd... I tried to see if they had some of his older stuff but it was the only one left... so I was left taking it... but thats ok... it still seems to sound good I have listened to either of them fully... but thats good because It will occupy me even more....

so tomorrow will only be semi relaxing... followed by a super busy week... missing my birthday with the triplets for only the second time in my 20 years of birthdays which is kinda sad... but I still love chloe and matt so it all works out in the end... I wont be home until sunday... but its all good"

When the sun came up,
We were sleeping in,
Sunk inside our blankets,
Sprawled across the bed,
And we were dreaming,

There are moments when,
When I know it and
The world revolves around us,
And we're keeping it,
Keep it all going,
This delicate balance,
Vulnerable all knowing,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, kill for this

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, you would...

Sing me something soft,
Sad and delicate,
Or loud and out of key,
Sing me anything,
we're glad for what we've got,
Done with what we've lost
Our whole lives laid out right in front of us,

Sing like you think no one's listening,

anywho Dtown doesnt suck as  bad as I thought it was going to... in fact Im having a blast.. last weekend was my friend shelleys wedding and it was fantastic..  kind of like a mini high school reunion.. but mostly with people I actually talk to... Also get to hang out with the pals quite a bit and I also enjoy coaching softball

next week Bee and I are headed to Fargo to train people at the store there... it will be nice... but its going to be a butt load of work... but that equals overtime... and I need that... so that will be nice


i cant think of anything else on the account that I should be sleeping"

i know its dumb to think that being friends with an ex is possible... maybe its not... My first ex and I get along just fine... the second one... we get along... but hes faking for all I care... If you want to hang out with me... cool go by your word... but if you dont just tell me... I mean who says ""yeah we are GREAT FRIENDS!!! we can hang tons!!!"" and then just ignores me... like one handshake and thats it...

and heres what I think is more stupid.. THE KID THAT BULLIED ME ALL THROUGH ELEM school talked to me more... gave me more hugs (even though he bullied me he was still an alright guy) and paid more attention to me than this ""supposed"" friend of mine... 

whatever.. I know its dumb to even complain... he never paid attention to me... we never really dated in my opinion because he thought I wasnt even good enough to tell his friends we were dating... so for all I care screw him... I hope he likes ditching his friends and making me feel  less and less love towards him.... 

he has just one thing of mine that he supposedly has actually showing in his room... I want it back... even when I gave it to him... it was Feb 11 a couple days before valentines day and the kid wouldnt even come out to get it... I was in town right outside his house and he didnt even come get it.. I threw it on his car and left.. I shouldnt have even left...

I had called him once and he said that he had it still... well damnit I should take it back... there are more people in my life that deserve that bear more.. to know that ""Someone in Morris Loves"" them...

hows it going


Jazz fest this evening was a blast... as usual.. because I love my jazz family they make me so happy I could puke... haha but not really...

other than that Im procrastinating on putting a few more interpretations in my french paper.. but mainly because I feel like I cant type right now... my hands are a little chill and I want to go puddle ""humping"" as Kalie accidentally called it back at home once... and Im mixing french and english together when i type... how aeasy would life be if I could just speak/type/write in franglish

interesting unknown fact:
for at least ten years.. I thought the remote control was really called a ""telecommande"" even in English... its what my parents always called it (they had spoke french to us when we were little and the words just clicked) and I never found out that it was a remote control until my friend asked me what the hell I was asking for when i asked for the ""telecommande""....  and a leg rest was always a pouf or however we pronounced it...

oh the wonders of lieing to children...

jk my parents are wonderful

and clarification.. while my mother had passed her citizenship test/interview a month ago.. she actually got sworn in today.. and yesterday was her birthday... so her birthday present was American citizenship... excellent... Now shes excited just to vote.... yessssss


ok I guess not much is new.. Cities with French club tomorrow to see a play at St Kates... then coming home late... sleeping for the rest of my life.. and then hopefully saturday evening I will be spending with Bekah and Becky... and whoever else... ahhhh rest and relaxation..."

"event","last night was probably one of the most fun nights I have had in a long time!

it basically started with the house kids all doing homework and studying (yeah we really do rock) then as soon as we got plans arranged I got Nic and came back to the house.  Following that little adventure Halley Kev Nic and I walked to Don's... and interestingly enough some kids thought it would be cool to drag race alone on main street with the most annoying sound car ever... and the second time they raced past us it looked as like they almost flicked us off and pointed a gunlike gesture at us... at least thats what it kinda looked like.. it could have been very well just a Buddy Christ gesture.. Im not sure... but i freaked so I ran across the street so we could get to Don's quicker.  There was a table filled with all the Morris cops and one state trooper... I thought it was a funny coincidence that a minute after a group of kids left.. the cops jumped from the table and gunned it out the door (almost like a dine and dash) but later we saw the cops were by the gas station next to DeToys in an alley.... bizarre.. I was hoping they busted those drag racing jerks but who knows... dinner was good at Don's as usual.. then we walked back home and I took Nic back to his apartment.. hahah did something i havent done in what feels like YEARS (goofy high school stuff) then went home and did some more homework with the kids before I went to bed early... good times...


Kevin likes to scare me with the mouse traps cause he thinks its funny... but someday he will really get his finger trapped"

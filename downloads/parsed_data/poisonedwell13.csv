Love is murderous.
Die young and save yourself.
Its all a whim.
A roll of the dice.
A fork in the road.
Put forth your all.
How shall it end?
Oh the posibilities.
Yet always such the ghost.

Still we give our hearts.
For the chance to love.
Try and fail and die. 
Live and breath and soar."

Let me try and explain.

Worked sucked today.  We are always there late on Mondays, but of course, the belt threw an ungodly amount of rods forcing us to have to stay even later due to the setback. But this morning I got to see Wendy and take her to work.  Even though I didnt see her for long, it was good just to see her.  I was in a good mood, so having the problem at work and having to stay late didnt bother me...like it normally does.  

Did that make any sense?  I think it did...

Moving along...
Late nights, snuggling, xbox...those were the glory days!  :)
Maybe again soon... 

Well, I suppose its time to try and go to bed so I can wake up that sexy creature Wendy in the morning.

"event","Before I begin, I have take in a good laugh at the comment about me wanting Mallori! Ha!  Why on Earth would I want to give up my peaceful, happy, more affordable life for her?  

Lets start off by first saying that you dont know anything about me.  You dont know me, and what you think you know about me is either A. Just complete bullshit. Or B. Truth streched so far that it is nothing that it originaly was.
What makes the whole situation even more sad for you and anyone else in her company, is that nobody knows Mallori.  She cant stay the same person for very long, and even if she did, her dishonesty would always shield the truth.  The eyes cant decieve the way the mouth does.  And thats all you have is words from the mouth.
You are defending a whim. How am I stupid?

Secondly, why do you read my entries?  Ultimately, they are no bussiness of yours.  And Mallori, you dont give two shits about me so what does what I say matter to you?  It shouldnt.  You should laugh...because its me speaking.  Pretending that things affect you annoys me.  Youd have to  care first, and im not stupid enough to believe that you do.

Last but not least, my entry is based on the principle of honesty.  I dont like being lied to...nobody does.  Though Mallori is dead to me in many ways, what we were allows me to care about her as a person, and excuse me for thinking that some of the things she does are downright moronic.  Its sad though that ive offered more help to her than most of her so called bestfriends.
Phrases such as ""Everything will be alright"" and ""Ill take care of you"" cant be wrote off as words of wisdom.

Keep those novel attempts at defense coming.
And Ill continue to laugh.
While you remain kept in the dark.

I think im going to have to do something about that pesky ""Annonymous"" post thing.  Since no one has the balls not to hide behind the annonymous posts, that should eliminate most nonsense. 
Accually, kudos to Mallori.  She accually does have the balls to make her self known."

Things have been downright crazy.  Maule has been off work for the past couple of weekends which means the whole crew is off, which in turn means big parties!

Friday night i got off work pretty late.  So did adam.  But we still improvised like a mofo with the little beer left when we got home.  We both killed a bottle of wine we had in the fridge.  That did the trick!  

Saturday was crazy too.  Keg! It was a blast.  

Sunday was no different, except for us all going out late at night and trying to find the insane asylum off of pines road.  We found it...sort of.  We were in there, but the accual building is off into the woods from the winding roads through there.  It was so dark and we didnt have good flashlights so we could find it in the woods.  It was still fun running up in there.  And luckily there werent any ""fireflys from hell"" to make Maule and Breland haul-ass back to our cars.  I think saturday afternoon we need to make a trip out there when its light out, find the place and then come back at night so we can accually find it.

Adam is a roomate now...and thats cool.

Have you ever had something so perfect it seams unreal?
Something so amazing that it takes your breath away?
Something so wonderful that you feel as if youd die without it?
Then lose it?
Then you cant help but compare that to everything else that happens in your life.
And it always appears that nothing can surpase what once was. 
Its never good enough...never amazing enough...never seams unreal.  
You know its real...but its just lacking.
You know that the perfection is gone...and its not going to come back.  
And deep down, you dont want THAT  particular perfection again...but just perfection again.
Being happy yet not as happy as you once were...
Then comes the comparison.  
Nothing can be as good as the first feeling.

I want to stop comparing.  
Stop wasting every second for nothing.

I guess ill continue comparing until something comes along and makes me forget about all past experiences.

I want to have a good steady job.  I have that.  I want to buy a new car.  I have that.  I want to go to school.  I am in school.  I want to be on my own.  I am on my own.  I want to be in love again.

I want to feel complete again.  To love...and be loved.

I hate stress.  Life is stressfull and sometimes I just hate life.  Just once Id love to be happy and have no worries.  Im sick of being sad.  Im just not going to be anymore...just ignore everything until it goes away or gets better somehow.  

Love is a fucked up thing.  Nothing else can make you both so happy and so depressed.  Ill never understand it.  Today I kissed Satan...and strangly, I liked it.  I like closing my eyes and drifting away with her.  ...I sometimes question whether I should though...   but I want to soar again...please take me away again.  I think Ive figured things out though:  Most everything that feels so right usually ends up being so wrong...somehow...

Maybe its just rhetorical...
Ah hell.  Fuck it.  It will always be a mystery.

"event","Tonight for you reading pleasure...a rant!
About...Disgustingly lazy fuckers!

Today just did me in...the world is full of extremely lazy people.  I can be lazy at times but my laziness is few and far between and to me, not unhealthy. But, some people just amaze me...and it makes me want to rip their arms off and beat them with thier own limbs.

I was at work...working as I should have been when along comes a fellow co-worker.  This particular person works in what we call ""Area Z"" and rides on an Easy-Go bringing items that cant go on the belt to us.  He approaches me and a buggy is slightly in the way.  He honks before getting near where I am.  I am not relatively close to him, and i find him rather annoying, so I ignore his presence.  Close to 5 minutes pass and he continues to sit, expecting me to move the buggy for him.  I continue to ignore him.  After those few minutes he steps off and gives the buggy a little kick, easily clearing his path...and off he goes.  

THIS KINDA SHIT PISSES ME OFF!  How hard is it to do something for yourself?  Obviously quite difficult indeed.  Im pretty sure the whole time he is thinking ""Boy, I hope he comes and gets this buggy cuz I really dont wanna have to move it myself.""  Worthless peices of shit!  I have always thought that some people were in someway related to slugs and this occurance makes me all more confidate that my theory is correct!

I am a fucking genius!

Now if there was a way to rid my workplace of stupidity and ignorance...

...Sadly, I do not have an act of God handy at my disposal.

I feel like shit right now...a little better than I have, but shit none the less.  I woke up with one of the worse headaches that I have had in a long time and it just wouldnt go away.  I gathered up enough strength to run to get some pain medicine a little while ago.  I got a Mt. Dew to take the pills with...   Bad choice...  I lost it and the pizza I had eaten earlier once I got home.  I am starting to feel better though.  

Steph has been moved to another hospital.  She sounds like she is doing a lot better.  I didnt get to see her this morning because they moved her before I could make it to the hostipal.  She should be out after 72 hours.  
I just really hope that this is a lesson well learned.

I think now would be a good idea to get my migrane pills refilled.  Those are some great pain killers...I could have felt like new by 3 o'clock.  I am now an Excedrin fan...best over-the-counter shit!  

In other news...

I am off work Tuesday.  I thought there was a concert with my favorite band that night, but they are playing in Baton Rouge...they changed it!  Grr!  That sux!  Well, me and Mallori are going to hang out Tuesday.  She is going to get a piercing.  Im looking forward to spending some time with her.  We havnt hung out in so long...  it may be my last chance to spend some time with her.  

Well, I am off to go see Steph.

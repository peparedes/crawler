"event","<p>I've also noticed more and more parents censoring the clothings that their preteen and teenaged daughters wear out in public. Why?!!?!?! They have the mental capacity to choose how they want to dress. I can't count the number of times my mum said to me as I was leaving the house, ""Tamao, you look like a goddamn whore. The only reason Marik's been dating you for so long is because you're good eye candy!"" but still, she let me wear my outfits. Seriously, as long as my ass, my vagina, and my breasts were covered, she didn't have any right to censor her sixteen-year-old daughter. And now that I'm older and dress a wee bit more casual, I feel that we should let other young people get their hoochie on as Zelda and I once did.</p>"

"event","<p>Today I met a new friend. His name is Jesus Carpenter. (no, I'm not going into a biblical rant, his name really is JESUS). Joey brought him over to the house today. It was a bit odd. Here's how it went down...</p><p>MARIK + ME: ::snogging on a bench::</p><p>JOEY: ::walks up:: Hey!</p><p>ME: I thought you were leaving to go to the amusement park.</p><p>JOEY: Oh, I am. But I have to wait until Jesus gets through peeing in a bush first.</p><p>From there, we later realized that Joey was referring to a New Zealander mate named Jesus, not the saviour Jesus.</p><p>Weirdness.</p>"

"event","<p>Whelp, I finally got one of these blog things. I figured that I should start keeping a diary thing, so that way my biography can be accurately written shall I suddenly bite the dust. So, let's see...things about me:</p><p>1) My full name is Tamao Elisabeth Lorraine Hopital, but I go by ""Missie"" because my older brother, Vincent, always called me a ""sexy little missy"" as a child.</p><p>2) I was born in Britain, but I am of French and Corsican descent. This means that I have a natural tan and don't have to worry about getting skin cancer in order to look good! Whoo-hoo!</p><p>3) I love my boyfriend, Marik Pelosi. We have been dating since July 07th, 2007, and feel that we are basically married even though it is not legal.</p><p>Yep. Those are the three main&nbsp;things. Oh, yeah, I like to party and have fun, and sometimes I say REALLY stupid things on accident.</p><p>More bloggish activity later. I'm off to ""sleep""! :)</p><p>Love, Missie</p>"

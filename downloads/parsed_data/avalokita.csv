"event","Been going through another one of my episodes where I'm in denial that Jason has autism. I had convinced myself to get a second opinion and go to another children's hospital. 

Then after that spat, I'm back to reality. His ""thing"" is saying ""banga banga banga"" and head-butting or chin-butting or hitting or kicking. It's not in anger. It's all sensory overload. He's started grinding his teeth too. He's afraid of anything that swings or moves that's out of his control now.

Who I kidding? Only myself. I need to stop letting my mother's denial seep into me.  

I also need to stand up and be a responsible mom and get my son into special ed preschool. There's a big part of me that's terrified of putting him in the care of strangers, but other moms tell me it did wonders for their kids. And he wants the company of other children, and God knows my own friends haven't bothered to invite me to playdates, etc., anymore."

"event","I told this woman who I don't know too well that I have a son with autism.  Her response? She told me how ""all these kids"" are diagnosed these days who shouldn't be.

I stared at her for a minute then looked away. How do I explain to someone what I live with? My adorable little boy ""knocks"" on me with his teeth clenched, hesdbutts me, or pushes his feet into me and sometimes kicks.  He's not doing this maliciously. He's doing this because something in his brain wants a force to push back against his body. 

How do I explain that at the playground, my son can't ""converse."" He desperately wants friends, but all he knows to do is echo every phrase a child or adult around him says.  

If I ask him if he likes something, he doesn't know how to answer. If I ask him if he enjoys a foot rub or wants ice cream, he repeats the sentence. The only thing he says with conviction is ""no way.""

How do I explain to someone how my son panics when someone new enters the house, disrupting his routine of lining up cars on the floor all day? It's the only thing he wants to do.

No one really understands what I'm going through. None of my friends have any clue what I'm dealing with, the fears I carry with me every waking moment. 

I dreamt Jason allowed someone to cut his hair. If you knew my son, you'd knew why this is only a dream. I can't hold him still enough to do it. I'm afraid he'll get a scissor in his eye.  

I love him more than anything on earth. He's a loving, sweet little boy who wants friends to play with, and yet kids seem instinctually afraid of him. Once in awhile I'll meet a hyper kid who takes a liking to him and then I'll never see that child again. 

I have no support network of friends with kids. 

My own mother denies that my son has autism, and it makes me hate her. Everything he does she chalks up to normal toddler behavior. I feel like I have no one to just hug me through this. Only Jason.


In other news, I guess I haven't been on here since I went into the hospital. Something is up with my heart, and no one has found an answer yet.  I'm on some medication that is controlling the skipped heart beats, so life moves on.
My hands are starting to get VERY cold.  The medication I'm on for my heart makes Raynauds syndrome worse. 

Somedays I wonder how much longer I'll be able to continue working full time.  Though it's good for me, mentally if not physically. It keeps my mind off of the things I cannot change."

<lj-cut>
My heart twisted inside my chest.&nbsp; It was clear to me the man was autistic.&nbsp; After living with my son Aran for so long, I recognize the condition elsewhere in seconds.&nbsp; I realized I was staring at Aran&#39;s future.

When people think of autism, two images spring to mind.&nbsp; The first is of a cute child with a piping voice who probably gets bullied at school.&nbsp; The second is of a super-hero.

We see on TV shows and news stories about autism a lot of children who need help.&nbsp; The children are adorable.&nbsp; They say odd things or act in odd ways, and the adults watching think, &quot;Oh, that poor thing.&nbsp; We need to help!&quot;&nbsp; Once they know a child is autistic, they show patience and understanding.&nbsp; They want special education services in the schools and other services beyond the school.

We also see on TV shows the image of the autist as super-hero.&nbsp; Adult autists, both real and fictional, show amazing powers.&nbsp; Temple Grandin designs animal-friendly cattle chutes, sees the world in visual chunks, and goes on speaking tours.&nbsp; Kim Peek (on whom RAIN MAN was based) has an eidetic memory.&nbsp; Sheldon Cooper from THE BIG BANG THEORY (who has never been officially acknowledged as autistic but who shows all the symptoms) is a world-class physicist.

Here&#39;s the problem.&nbsp; The media always--ALWAYS--wants to show people as getting help or as succeeding.&nbsp; No one wants to end the broadcast on a downer: &quot;And, despite everyone&#39;s efforts to help, Alvin is now homeless, begging for spare change at the bus station.&quot;&nbsp; The children we see on TV shows inevitably get help, and the viewers are left with the vague idea that they&#39;ll be all right in the end.&nbsp; Autistic adults are portrayed as having successful full-time jobs where they&#39;re such highly-regarded experts, everyone is forced to accept their odd behavior.&nbsp; They even have friends.&nbsp; And the audience says, &quot;Well, see?&nbsp; Autistic people do just fine.&nbsp; They have super powers.&quot;

The problem is, they don&#39;t.

Only a few autists actually have a savant talent, and the majority of those talents don&#39;t lead themselves to a successful career.&nbsp; Aran, for example, has perfect pitch, but that won&#39;t land him a job anywhere.

In fact, less than 10% of adult autists actually work at all, let alone full-time.&nbsp; It&#39;s hard for autists to find work--most can&#39;t get past the job interview.&nbsp; The hiring manager might be the nicest person in the world, but she&#39;ll still be put off by someone who strides into the office and booms, &quot;This is my new job!&quot;

Most adult autists live on disability, or with relatives, or both.&nbsp; Some live in group homes or institutions.

And a big chunk are homeless.

Aran can live with me for as long as he needs to, but I won&#39;t be around forever, and I&#39;m watching the social safety nets in this country disintegrate a little more every day.&nbsp; Although there&#39;s a lot of help around for autistic children, these children grow into teenagers and then adults, and there&#39;s very little help for them.

While the media have helped bring autism into the spotlight, they have also given many Americans the false impression that with minimal help, autistic children grow into slightly odd but perfectly functional adults.&nbsp; They don&#39;t.&nbsp; They often need help and supervision all their lives, and that costs money.&nbsp; The trouble is, these autists aren&#39;t cute children with big eyes.&nbsp; They&#39;re adults moving into middle and old age.&nbsp; They don&#39;t dress fashionably, they walk funny, and their voices have a strange lilt.&nbsp; And when it comes to adults, we have this idea that they should shape up, try harder, do the right thing.&nbsp; They&#39;ve had a lifetime to learn how.&nbsp; Why don&#39;t they?&nbsp; It must be laziness or foolishness that makes them that way.

If you ask people flat-out if they believed the above, they deny it, of course, and profess compassion or pity.&nbsp; But left to their own devices, they&#39;ll sidle to the other side of the room.

I took the man from the parking lot inside the grocery store and bought him a hot drink at the bakery, then gave him $20.&nbsp; It was all I could do for him right then.&nbsp; He shouted a thank-you and shuffled down the cookie aisle.&nbsp; I watched him go, thinking of Aran and trying not to cry.

One day Aran will graduate high school.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know what&#39;ll happen then.&nbsp; He says he wants to go into finance or manage a hotel.&nbsp; If he can get through college and survive a job interview.&nbsp; Perfect pitch won&#39;t help him.

There are no autistic super-heroes.</div>"

I kept picking things up and holding it up to my pregnant belly dejected. Finally I gave up, and went to the rock t-shirt section, where a bunch of girly emo bands that I'd never heard of were on the shirts. But I tried on a gray one anyway, and it barely fit over my big boobs and belly.

It's like my subconscious mind is trying to resolve my 17-year-old self and my 27-year-old self.

That and all the maternity clothes I've been shopping for lately are pretty ""blah""."

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed Avatar. But I kept feeling deja-vuey while watching it."

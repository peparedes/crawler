"event","Chef Bob Long died suddenly yesterday, following his regular workout at the gym.  He was 50 years old.  Details regarding services and ways to support his family have not been worked out yet. 
 
Anyone who attended NECI in Montpelier in the past eight years remembers Chef Bob.  As a teacher, he  embraced importance of the Theory Class with vigor.  He constantly developed his materials, his kitchen format and his teaching style.   Bob's  desire to continually learn and improve himself and his class was admirable.  Most importantly, Bob kept the students right at the center of his efforts. As a MOD 1 instructor, Bob fully understood his role as gatekeeper and while teaching about the virtues of umami, he had a major impact on the lives of many students far beyond the kitchen.  With a firm delivery and a kind heart, Bob guided countless students over the initial hump, propelling them forward as better students , culinarians  and budding professionals.    Bob Long was an excellent teacher, friend and father to his three children.  His passing is indeed a great loss.

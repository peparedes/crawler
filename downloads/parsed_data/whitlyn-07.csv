"event","School in two weeks. AHH. I like just chilling and not worrying about class. Our new townhouse is amazing, pretty big and nice actually. I am happy right now. 

BUT I AM excited for DREW to come back. I don't know what it is, but as soon as I see him it's like instant comfort. Now i wont have to miss him. I FREAKING love him. We went putt-putt and ate fazoli's with Kara and Joe. He got me these gorgeous flowers for my bday,& PF Changs= heaven. Can't wait till school, but we had some awesome times this summer. And I cant wait to visit the UP again, great memories. 

Work is so boring I could shoot myself. Aside from the occasional interesting customer, LAME. I read an entire book today, front to back. HOLY GOD, I get paid for reading? Sometimes I feel cheesy for reading romance and girly novels. Whatever, I'll read a biography or something to balance it out. 

My birthday was fantastic. More like a week of fun. My friends here made it amazing. We had a party here on Saturday. I am really lucky to know such wonderful people. Seeing old friends was great, and I got an ice cream cake, balloons and everything. Amazing. <3 u guys. 


I feel really boring. I dont know if its work, or that its 11pm and I'm tired. Oh well, goodnight."

I took an entire wk off from work. I went to see Drew in the UP again, and to family vaca in Pentwater. Drew's was really great. I got to meet some more of his friends, and hang out with his mom a bit. It's weird to feel so close to someone, after spending time with their mom. hah. We went to the beach a ton, and partied it up. ALSO, I went to Red Lobster for the first time! And we stayed at our hotel, so that was good. It was a wonderful time, and I can NOT wait to see him again. Cuddling=best ever. My family rented a house in Pentwater. It was super duper nice, and 2 mins from the beach. It was a great wk to relax. 

I saw Wedding Crashers, it was real funny. Also this wk end, I went over to Amy's and we dressed up in 80's clothes and did our hair huge and in scrunchies. lol how random? good times.

My Organic Chem class is over with on Tuesday, I have never been so happy in my life to pass a class. I only have to get 40/220 pts to pass... so lets all pray that's easy. We went to Canada a few wk ends ago for Dianas bday. It was crazy fun. IT felt like Florida b/c it was so hot, but there was soo many ppl it was ridic. It is a great feeling to drink in front of cops without the risk of bein in trouble. 

I went camping in Traverse City with Drew! It was ridiculously fun. Everytime I get to see him I am soo happy, and everytime I leave I get all sad. hah. But we just camped and hung out and ate a flippin trillion smores and hot dogs. God, I really do love that boy. He makes me feel tres bien. <3 <3

Other than that, I have been playin on my mom's sball team. It is crazy fun. The ladies are soo funny and sometimes drunk. haha good times. Hopefully when my class is over I can hang out with my friends more! I did get to see Abby and her babies recently though, soo f'in cute. Like, wow. yeah. gorgeous kids.

We are moving into our apartment in a month and a week or so!!! soo excited. I cant wait. At the same time I am not used to having to pay for everything, and it might suck once it all hits me. I am really goin to have to keep track of my money and spend it wisely."

Then drove to his house saturday morning. His town is really nice and cute, and the land is amazing. Trees, bays with crystal clear water and cliffs. It was so refreshing. I met his grandparents and some of his friends. Then we went on Sunday to his camp back in the woods. Shot his gun, rode the four wheeler, cooked hot dogs.. It was so.. calming, and felt so right. It was really sad to leave.. but at the same time I am so content right now. I feel so lucky to have him.

I guess it's better than being bored all the time. Amy is doing well since her surgery, shes such a trooper. Its amazing really, i love that girl to death. 

I wish I would have had livejournal since I was little, it would've been sweet to write down all the awesome memories. I went and visited Kelly today, she was at her house with Mackayla and Elisha. I love little kids so much, sooo f'in cute. 

About a wk until my mini vacation. God, I hate not seeing drew. It will be the best wk end ever. :D

Living with some of my best friends=ROCK ON. So I have to take Organic Chemistry this summer, but only until June 30th.. I hope I can survive.

It's really weird to be away from people. I feel like after this wk end I should be going back to State. It's not so much that I don't like my house, it's that I love campus and everyone on it. I would rather stay there all summer and party like a rock star. 

Im hoping the summer is fun and relaxing, but goes fast. I'm anxious for next yr and all it has to offer me. Trip to the U.P in 3 weeks, I'm already anxious. Weird to care about someone so much.. 


Amy is having her brain surgery next wk. I LOVE YOU GIRL. You will do amazing :) All my love.

Thanks drucks :) Needless to say I woke up with a sore hip (from falling down a ladder), a swollen eyebrow & ring( from falling face first into a door), and crusty eyes (from crying for no reason). ahhh memories. lol Drucks and I went to house sit b/c my parents left for vegas.. really great time. Bike riding, trampoline, breakfast.. Then we watched my sister win her sball tournament! YAY. Last night we went to Starting Line, super super fun. They need to have concerts like that all the time. School seems to not really matter right now, just b/c i have a lot of other things I want to do rather than study. Oh well.

Its just like routine for me now, I don't even think about what I'm doing Thursday nights. Thats really bad though because I havent went to my Friday class for like 5 times. God sometimes I hate myself for being such a lazy ass. I was doin well in that class too. But Thursday night was ridiculous and included spilling massive amounts of drinks all over everything. Then I remember calling everyone over to tell them ""Get er done if she aint been done to git""..or something of the sort.. wtf? lol Also I remember the funny ass elevator ride with Hutch and Tom @ Spartys. Passing out carrots and dip with Drew was also funny. Alcohol rocks. lol.

Last night was fun too. We didn't win the basketball game, but still I had fun. I wanted to go to Stoddard but apparently everyone was getting tear gased.. thats no good at all.. I took it upon myself to drink a whole 1/2 fifth.. hmm. not cool. lame, or lame-o as drew would say. 

Also I got pranked on April Fool's Day and didn't even know it, since I haven't been at my dorm since like Weds. night. Wow.. I should really start staying there more. but ne ways so i go to get some underwear out and im like wtf? I have like zero pairs, and no bras.. I just figured I must've lost a ton of underwear.. Danielle is like, whit do u have ne bras or underwear? wow. good one guys. I didnt even know u hid them all.  i laughed. <3 I can not picture living without you guys.."

I joined the group RUBI.(Respecting and Understanding Body Image). I'm super excited about it. I really want to get involved with it and learn a lot. 

Just ran like 3 miles. I thought it was warmer this morning, yeah it must've gotten cold. It still felt great.. Running is my favorite thing to do.. It's such a personal thing to me, and it's so relaxing.

I love laughing soo much. Then we went back and hung out and watched Saw. Drew got me flowers, nicest ever! Seriously, I never get flowers. I'm still smiling. lol. im so glad i dont wear a retarded helmet too..


Like 7:00 this morning I had to go to an eye appt in PTL. I got these new contacts that like you can wear forever! I can wear them night and day for 30 days. So thats fun. But yeah, then I met with my new Dietetics advisor. Super nice lady. She laid out all I need to do and explained the major to me. I feel a lot better. Except that I have to take BioChem and organic. Um, yuk? YEAH. And I have to take a trillion summer classes which sucks. I just feel like too that I'm going to be so busy for the rest of my college life. That sucks. I just wanna be a lazy bum. But oh well, I guess you have to start being responsible sometime. 

Sunday night I'm going to go see Abby and her babies. I can't wait. I miss her so much, and Ethan and Ella should be almost 6 months now. So excited :D My mom told me today that she wants to go vacation in Aruba now, bc tickets to Hawaii are too expensive. Whateve, anywhere warm would be fine by me. I don't really think I want spring break to come. Minus the schoolwork, I'd rather just stay here..


My days just keep being awesome, and to be honest it kinda scares me..But I'm not gonna complain.. Hope you are all doing awesome.

This morning I woke up on my futon without any blankets in a huge sweatshirt with my contacts in and glasses on also.. Napolean Dynamite was on repeat and he kept saying. GOD. There was 5 pops spilled and a huge 1/2 gallon of Popov just chillin. I went to my computer, and the only IM up was one that was to MYSELF> I actually had a like 10 min long convo with MYSELF. Wow.. SO drunk. It was all giberish and super funny.  Made NO sense. AND i was getting ready for work and burnt my hand on the straightener. SO BAD> But anyways. I had a good night. The night before @ hutchs was fun also. 

I picked a major! YAY. I chose dietetics/ nutrition. I like helping people and i like biology a lot. I figured a nutritionist could be a good job maybe?! who knows we will see. 

Valentines Day is soon. I dont know if im doing ne thing. Everyone is always really sad or really happy. I think its stupid. Who cares? Tonight should be fun though, I think Drew's coming back to State. 

Just went shopping with Dusty and dropped like a lot of unneccesary cash. I made him get these cute shoes too. lol. Money aint no thing.. right? Also- he only bought them b/c the salesman was cute. Thats my boy. haha.

But I was awesome at the beer bong I must say. It was fun except when my mom strolls into my dorm room @ 11am and I'm passed out on the futon with all my clothes on and smeared makeup. The first words she said were "" Whitney you smell like liquor and beer!!"" Glad to make her proud. hah.

Stephanies sister Emily got married. IT was crazy, because I've grown up with them both. After the wedding part, Hutch came over to hang before the reception. OMG did we laugh. I whipped out one of my old journals from like 7th grade. Here's a little sample,"" Jason Locke loves Becky! NO FAIR. I saw him today and he smiled. So i might ask him out"" or ""Oh, FYI diary, I am popular now. YAY! I love middle school"" or do you remember when we used to say LYLAS? Love ya like a sis? Well apparently i loved my diary and told it, LYLAD. wow. Hutch just shut up! I was definetly a nerd back in the day. BIG nerd. Yeah yeah, im a nerd now, whatever :D But the reception wow, good times for sure. Got to see Ben and Matt from FL which was happy. I miss them! Plus my mom decided to drink and then that she wanted to dance like me. Funny funny night. Sunday night was wonderful also, hung out with Drew again. I think I have a big crush. 

I have to write this ridiculously stupid paper. I started it yesterday but I suck so much at writing. I can't do an outline or I get all frustrated so I just have to sit and start writing. Horrrrrible at it. Oh well!! I'm at work tonite, luckily I dont have to work over 20 hrs this week :D

I got to see Amy last night!!! Freakin yay. Made me super happy. We ate some Panda Express. It was so good to see her. 

A note to Danielle: It's ok to stalk that boy. You are hot enough and also cool. So get er done ok?!

I can't expect the worst, or hold myself back from something awesome because I'm afraid it might not be later on. MY D, Jor, and Rach are amazing. And chucking that ""box"" at me last night made me laugh a lot. Laughing is so awesome, and I swear makes everything better. Honestly though, its super refreshing to meet new people who actually seem to be completely sincere. Its a really weird feeling for me, but so good. And I'm gonna take it for all its worth. I'm on like 3 hours of sleep and my eye sockets hurt like a mofo. But not gonna lie, I love talking for hours at night.I do hate waking up though and having to leave.

I have a million things to do for next week. I have a wedding and work this weekend. And a paper, and a ton of bio stuff to do by Monday. But who cares? It always seems like life is busy so I should just accept it and shut up! (As Napolean would say)

My new goal for the month, well besides finally picking a MAJOR, is to stop swearing. Or at least not so much. As Danielle put it, using the F-word in every sentence makes me sound like a trailer slut. :D.. hey that might not be SO bad..

But really I have no idea why I keep procrastinating the whole major thing. Coming into college I swear I knew everything I wanted and exactly how I would get there. But for some reason suddenly the word ""doctor"" isn't doing as much for me as it used to.. So,any suggestions would be amazing. It seems so weird that we go to school for SO long, what for? So we can get a job, a house, a family, have kids and pay for them to do exactly what we did.. Sometimes it all seems fucked up and routine.

Thursday- We all went to Sparty's and danced forever. There was like 10 of us in the car on the way over, including Amy and Ron in the trunk. hah. Jake was beyond drunk. And there was this guy who was dancing so crazy, it was awesome.
Friday- I went with Danielle, Jor, and their cousin Dave among others to this coffee shop. There was a band called Sea defeats Sparrow playing. It was really fun. Then we chilled @ Beth's. I played euchre with some boys and totally didn't win. Dave is adorable, he's 16 and is really funny. It was like having a little brother stay with us all wk end. I always wanted a brother.
Saturday- Drew from my CJ class came to hang out in the dorm with me. ;) He seems really super awesome. Everyone was hanging out on the floor that night. His friend Andrew came to chill too. So we drank. Best ever, my RA got wasted!! He was going around and knocking on  peoples doors to ask for ID, and then like stumbling over. SO funny. 
Sunday- I went to Hutch's dorm and hung out with a bunch of people that I haven't saw in a long time. Caleb finally!, Jason, Jay, Randy, Ame, Hutch, Mo, Nikki, Tara.. it rocked.( DROP it likes its hottt, facebook pics, Mo wanting to be poked, spilling the grape pop, ""oh red pop tastes great with Captain Morgans"", liquor face.. )I also got a new nickname from Mo, it's not W anymore, its dubs. He thinks that ""w"" is hard b/c of the 3 syllables. ahha. We drank a little too much, i felt like an alcoholic this wk end. Drew lives in Wilson and I hung out there too. This morning I didn't feel too hot, but I had such a fun night being with everyone who rocks.

It was one of the most fun wk ends I have had in awhile, everything right now seems so great. But I'm so done drinking for awhile. My body's for sure mad at me. Tonight I most def have to do some homework and try to pick up our room. It can't stay clean for longer than an hour I swear. I really also need to buckle down and pick a major.. Eh, i just don't wanna yet. Abby and her babies might come up this week, so I'm excited for that. I haven't saw Kara either, sucky! ALSO i want to say that Steph Conley is an amazing person, and I will always be here for you.. Ok so sorry for the longest post EVER. :) xoxo"

I just got back from Florida last night. It was an awesome week. The weather there was like 75 and sunny everyday. We either went to a beach or went to the pool @ the apartment complex. When we were there it seemed like there were no problems or responsibilities. Steph, Hutch, and I went. 

One day we went to a beach bash for the Orange Bowl. Ashlee Simpson and Jojo and some other people sang on the beach. It was a lot a lot of fun. Other than the fact that it cost us 60 bucks for a cab! Bitches! 

Another day we went to Ft. Lauderdale beach and layed out and such. Hutch and I went into the water and I got this huge mouthful somehow. OMG saltiest, nastiest thing of my life. But also fun :D Later on that day Steph and I went parasailing. It was soo peaceful and an amazing view of the entire coast. 

There is to much stuff to write in this journal, so I'll just cut it off short. But some things I wont forget: getting lost with Hutch and almost peeing my pants because I laughed so hard, the huge ass mansions on the seaways, the scary gas station with the dancing lady, eating a million trillion sandwiches, Steph joke telling for at least 2 hours, our test tube shots, when the ducks attacked us, syrup man *cringe*, having to push start Matt's car, Spongebob, Matt from Boston at the pool telling us not to be ""retahded"" and wear SPF, snuggling on the pull out couch, and Ben yelling at us to EAT!

Going back to State tomorrow. I'm really excited. I miss D, and rach, and jor jor. I always like starting things out fresh. :D Hopefully I'll see Amy too, its been like a week! :(

It was straight out of a scary movie. So the second day on the slopes I was like oh yeah lets go down the side with all the jumps. And I was going to go over one that seems just like a hill. But yeah, IT WASNT AT ALL. It was like huge professional jump. My skis flew and then i fell. And left my pole on top on the hill. SO i had to climb up and get it. Then when i was running back down, I tripped.. and fell. AWESOME. so needless to say no ski hotties for me. lol.

Last night the girls and I went to see Meet The Fockers. It was a lot of fun. It always is nowadays. It seems like the days of any drama are long gone and it makes me so happy, just to be with my BEST friends. And Stephanie always has words of wisdom for me. Whether its : fuck them whitney, or you will always have your best friends. :D 

FLORIDA , t-minus 3 days. YAY. I can NOT wait. It will be so awesome, mainly just because it will be above 15 degrees!! And we were reassured there would not be a tsunami.

The cookies looked more like flattened blobs than sleds or bears. And the frosting kept running off the cookies and also had chunks of powder in it because we didn't mix it up enough. They look sooo bad but its so funny. I cant wait until we go on Vacation!! We went to Washington D.C. last summer. It was really really fun but sooo hot, like 95 everyday.

Soo fun. and last year I decided it would be smart to steal some beer for us from my dad. So yeah, we get up there and I bust it out. I stole like FOUR Stroh's. Funniest time ever, mainly because we never even drank them.. ahh good times. I really want to go home and watch Prancer.

5 days until Christmas, 6 days until skiing, 2 weeks until Florida 


I <3 break."

"event","YAY! We finally signed a lease for an apartment for next fall. It is a three bedroom townhouse @ Dover's Crossing. I can't wait to have our own place. At the same time though, its so much money for everything. I wish I wasn't growing up! Also I want to try and get a car for next year, so no more random shopping trips for Whitney. But yeah, living with Amy and Hutch will be awesome. Two years not living with them was enough :) But at the same time living away from all my friends in the dorms is going to be so hard and weird. 

Christmas, 10 days away. Present count : zero. Yeahhhh so I should start shopping like really really soon. I feel like I have no time. Its like class, work, homework, workout.. etc etc. NO TIME. And its so hard to shop for some people. Everything always goes by so fast. Oh well. I am really looking forward to the break. Skiing with my family, and Kara is always fun. I miss everyone and just need to chill. I also need to try and figure out what major I want. It's just really hard to pick exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life, its such a huge thing.

Ok so I'm at work and the nicest people just came up to my window, it was a wife and husband and they were soo happy and lovey. I can't wait until I find someone super awesome like that. 

Tonight is going to consist of studying forever for my last exam tommorow, Criminal Justice. Pretty common sense but I still want to do well. I need to pack up to go home too because I am going to visit my old roomate Abby tommorow. Her babies are almost 3 and a half months now. I can't wait, they are gorgeous :D I love kids soooo much. Ok well good luck on exams everyone !! MERRY CHRISTMAS :D"

I just wanted to say thanks to everyone this semester who has helped me get by and made it amazing. Amy and Hutch for listening to me to no end, making me do what I needed to and for always making me smile. Danielle, Rach, Jor, Linds.. for being the most wonderful bunch of people to live with ever. Thanks to my awesome work friends, and all my old friends too. I look forward to another kick ass semester, but at the same time never want this to end. Lets make the most of it :) Going to listen to a CD cabe made me and off to bed so I can kill my exam tomorrow. Much love."

"event","Ok- So i just figured out my live journal. Apparently I had forgotten my password also username. I've been at work all day. I decided I'm going to use this journal as a place to log all of our fun nights. One that happened a few weeks ago I don't want to forget. It was hutch, zac, tara, and I. We drank at my place and decided to go to Ben's from work. SO FUN. I had like a trillion shots, and some beer bongs. A lot of our friends went and it was just a great time. But dont forget "" This one last shot, this is for the paparazzi."" :) Ok It's now 4:30. BOO to that. I have to stay up all night and study too. Calculus might kick my ass tommorow. Maybe I shouldn't have smoked chronic last night or stayed up till 3:00, eh whatever. Only live once right? At least we have our singing to look forward too. Danielle Jor and I listened to about 10 Disney songs before we went to bed last night. "" darlin it's better down where it's wetter, take it from me."" :D  Well im off to study. Also, don't be too stressed about exams because when you are 80, is it really going to matter? NO. i think not.

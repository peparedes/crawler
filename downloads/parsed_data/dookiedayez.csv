"event","It seems like forever since i updated my LJ. i don't know why. prolly cause i have lots of other shit to do. like lay around, work, waste time with jack and such.

HMm so updates:

work: I work at a YMCA day camp with a buch of kids who are on government sponsorship and come from fucked up families, if they even have any. Its tough, the kids are tough. Its fun sometimes. Im in charge of food there and thats cool. speaking of tat... shit, i need to call in food for monday... (10 minutes later) I love my boss because she doesn't fire me for things like that. anyways, its hectic outside in the hot sun all the time. On the plus side, im really dark and look kinda israeli, which is cool. i guess that's it.

Social: Life is out there, but i have to go get it. the problem with wqorking is that i dont have much energy to go out at night. But i've been hanign with a very good mix opf school/college/jewish friends this sumemr and I dig it. I had a party and It was fuckin cool as hell. my first real party. I had like 30 kids there, lots of boozing and rediculious ness. it was sweet. I also had my first taste of everclear(straight), which was a bag idea. Im glad so many random people could come. Meh, thats all.

WOmen: Katherine and I are no longer together. It seems to fit the odd pattern of my life. I've had 3 semester long relationships in a row now,, and i think that's wierd. The other weird thing is that the girls I date are usually not perfect for me, and we both kinda know it. but comtinue anyways. I'd even go as far as to say that they lose interest in the relationship way before we break up, but just feel bad for me cause I treat them too well to just dump my stupid ass. SO they usually go longer then they should. I guess it's just weird. Meh, whatever.  Since Katherine, I did have a breif, yet non-trimphant thing with this girl named amy. She's jewish and really amazingly awsome and deffinatly the smallest girl I've ever hooked up with (if you thought it was possible). 4'9"" and 93 pounds baby. Really cute though (and she is 20, not 11 for those who were thinking otherwise). O well, that didn't work out, but it kept my mind occupied, which was good.

Im ready to go back to school. I miss my brothers and all my sexy ladies that surround my everyday life when i'm there. yeah. Overall, im pretty content with life right now. just want summer to end and move mack into the oaks.

"event","So lots of time has past. I guess I'll sum up the last 3-4 months of my life.

Social life(school): Fraternity life kicks ass. I we re-elected as the house historian and am the philanthropy chair in the fall. This means that haunted house is my responsibility, so it has to kick total ass. We a very good big kahuna party this year and the 6-tons of sand was a nice touch. I started playing softball/dodgeball intermurally at school. Both our teams were really good, so that was fun compared to our never victorious basketball team. Hmm, next year I'm rooming with justin again and we are in a really sweet room. that is awsome. I started hanging out at Peace and Justice house more. Those kids are fun. I also began to get really close with jackson towords the end of the year. I'm going to miss his sarcasm next year. Life was good, very busy, but good. One of my brothers is getting married in a couple weeks, and his bachelor party is coming up. it will be fun, but im afriad I may be a little uncomfortable. we'll see.

Social life(home): I love summer. summer makes me really happy because I get to see so many that I love. It means late night tacobell runs, massive parties at kory's house(like the one last night that totally kicked ass), many games of euchre, bonding with my family, seeing jack, ben, nate, molly, kory, and steph and so many others that I love. The only wierd thing about this summer, is that it will be my first summer without ben. Ben is always my summer scapegoat for everything. We are always so bored, but bored together, so it's ok. But no ben this summers gonna suck. oh well. Molly, jack, and steph will be in town for me to hangout with now, so thats good.

Work: I am hopefully getting a job at a daycampp run by the YMCA for underprivlaged kids grades 1-6. it should be fun,. the only bad thing is that it starts at like 8:30... boooo ealry waking : (.

Women: I'm still dating Katherine, and I am very happy with her. We have alot of fun together and she makes me smile a lot more then I usually do. She lives in Wyoming ohio, which is just outside cinci. But fortunatly for me, she will be doing summer school at OWU this summer, so she will be around. yey. We've been dating since feb. 14 (classic valentines day stuff, huh?) and though we've had somxe bups and potholes on our trail, im hoping this summer will be a leasurly cruise with the windows down and the wind blowing through our hair.

ok, time to go mow the lawn, so until then, take it easy

"event","SO i bet everyone thought I'd never update again, being that it's been since september that I last did. Well, you're wrong. Here I go

In the past 5 months, lots have happened. Many friendships have strengthened. Not many have windled out. I finally am adjusted to fraternal liveing and the ways of greek life. Thats a plus I do suppose. I have a 3.2 last semester and I was quite pleased with that. I'm taking another education class, it just might kill me. Meh, oh well.

I guess the main thing in my life is that im going back to school in like 3 days and My girlfriend amanda and I just broke up. ANd the first is weird, but the second one is not really want i think I want. I mean, I really liked spending time together and after like 3 months of sketchy shit, it seemed like we were going strong for once. Then we started drifting the last week of school. and Then yesturday we broke up. Now, I was very ok at the time, because i was at home and It's like I lost something in a different world, cause school and hom,e are like night and day. But last night I went back to school, and stayed in my room, and everything reminded me of her. Her pillow and side of the bed, seeing the scarf she made me, the loft ladder in which we shared excessive amounts of goodbye kisses before one of us left. The shirts of mine she used to wear. The times I had to make her dance with me at parties, and how I had more fun dancing with her then anyone else in the world.

All these things that I really didn't concider would hit as hard as they did. So now I'm distraught. I mean we both kinda wanted to break up, but it's really not going to be as simple as I thought at the time. MEH......"

Not for any particular reason, I just haven't got around to it.

Life in the house is busy, cause there are a lot of lazy son-bitches that live there and as much as I love em, sometimes picking up the slack can be annoying. But ya know what? I'm over it.

Case race was this past weekend. I didn't win, but I still got really drunk and had a good time. I think emily drunk dialed me, but i'm not sure. SAtnight was exceptionally slow, cause justin was outa town and amanda went home, and this ment no girls at all at the house. So I sat around and watched movies all day. It was nice, but it could have been nicer.

This week will no doubt be shitty.  I have a quiz and 3 exams left this week. I took a quiz today and I think I did ok. I'm struggling in most my classes right now, but i think I can bring them up.

I helped cook dinner tonight. That was nice,  cause I like cooking. 

I guess that's it. nothing exciting.......meh

The house- Chi Phi is great. I live with 23 of the greatest guys in the world. 

School- Giong pretty well. actually having to do work now, which kinda sucks, but i guess thats what i'm here for.

Women- My cute little thing with amanda is still going on. I'm taking her to dinner tonight, it should be fun. We don't have an official title on our situation, but as far as i'm concerend, i'm not looking elsewere. I think i'a post a pic or 2 soon, because she's so cute.

Social things- Lots of partying, like usual. Watched a movie or 2 with amanda, and justin with sam. It's nic for us to be seeing friends, so that we can do things in sets of 4. Molly with a Z came up to visit and we had a good time with bonding, alcohol, and hookah. There was a keg there that night, so there were a lot of hung oer people that next morning. Umm, this weekend is packed. We have a recruitment cookout on nfriday, foam party on saturday and Jell-o tug-o-war on sunday. It'll be a busy week.

"event","First week was very good. I have a good work schedule, and no classes tues, thurs until 1:10. Socially life is going great. 

Friday night After class we played basketball. Unfortunatly basketball always reminds me of how out of shape I am. Anyways so that was fun, even though my glasses broke. When I came back, PUC, Ira, Sam, Paul, and I wend to Bw3's for dinner. MMM meatty goodness. Then on my return I found my room full of girls and they had already been drinking a bit. So i figured I'd Catch up, which involved a heft glass of th wonderful 100 proof SoCo(which is my new drink of chioce). SO the night went from there. And Throughout the night, i had been pretty(very) flirty with my friend amanda (who by the way is the definition of adorable). So that later led to a very cute evening, but that's some detials I'm choosing to skip over.

Saturday I got up, and had my first Martha Sat. Brunch of the year. MMMM so good. So after a series of being up/napping with the little lady, I took her back to campus, caught a shower, and a nap. Then went frisbee golfing around campus, got italian ice, then took another nap (yeah, I was tired). Then Justin's redneck friends from out of town came in and we all got chipotle and it ws really good. Ben and lauren came from out town to visit me for the evening and I liked that. It was really nice seeing them. Unfiorunatly, they came on a night of our PAJAMA PARTY!! which by the way was a huge sucess. I liked it expecially cause I had a specially little lady to dance really goofily(and cutely) with all evening. So after the party I had a couple of cocktails and cuddled up. While Cuddling up, we somehow missed the train of people going back to campus, so amanda stayed the night again(what a shame :) ). Anyways, that was last night

So today Amanda;s friend came at 10:30 to pick us (convienient cause i didnt have to walk her back) and I went back to bed. Ben and lauren left and we had a meeting and house clean up and now im putting off doing work by telling way to many boring details about my life. I hope your happy that i made an update that is super positive cause the last few have been mehhy.

"event","OK. So I like my schedule a whole lot this semester. But there's just this class. It's Called Anti-semetism, Zionism and the Holocaust. It's Taught by this amazing Prof (Dr. Philips) and The subject is soo intresting. But their's one downside. Afer every class, when I walk out of the room, I feel like a huge burden has been lifted. It is by far the most emotionally intense Class Ive ever had, and It's kinda hard to handle 1.5 straight hours of the history and reasoning for the hatred and murder of my people. And I look at the faces of the Goys in the class when the session is over and they are all dead serious and meloncolly. Now imagine the way the 4 jews in my class feel every time we leave that class. Today, it took use about 3 minutes before we were able to attempt to carry a conversation, just because of how much the class impacted us. Its rough.

On a lighter note, I helped out in an interfaith service today. I think since walton graduated, I've taken over the role of the rabbi at my school.l It's kind of ammusing.

Anyways, homework time.

Everyone is supposed to stand by their friends no matter what, but what if what they did was wrong? Its really hard to ""abandon"" them by calling them on it, and telling them they fucked up and to be non supportive. 

On another note, I got a curve ball thrown at me, but the thing is, is that im not even sure if Its actually being thrown or It's just all in my head. Meh, I'm not to worried about the whole deal, things will work themselves out.

On another note, Everyone's back. Justin, Biz, Kara, Brian and I hung out tonight, like old times and It was great. I missed all of them so much, and I even got a bit of cuddling out of it (score! It has been sooooo long). SO all is well, except I spent 3 hours tryint to find the perfect class to add tomarrow ( I think I got it) so I need to go to bedso I can be awake for class.

Jack, Ben, Lauren andI had a really sweet night. WE went out for italian ice and hung out at ben's house. It was a night full of stupid fun stuff, pelvic thrusts, srcounging up change, toilet paper, getting neighbor's arrested, intresting phone calls at 3 am, all sorts of fun. good times.

Ok, so brett, nina, christina, yael and annie came in. That was very exciting. There was a large gathering at the zwelling residence and it was actrually not very akward for me. yeye, big kids! so i got to do a bit of bonding with them. Nina and I had a good cuddle/talk on molly's bed that was nice, and I got to talk to yael. I hadn't seen ehr in over a year, and I forgot how much of an awsome girl she was. So that was nice. I got to see fun columbus kids as well, but nothin too exciting happened. Next day was Alana's grad party which was nice. I got to hang out with fun kids again, and Elyse came in (yey). 'tis prolly the last time i see her for at least a month and a half, maybe even longer. We didn't really have much of a chance to catch up, but its ok, next time. I had more bonding time with yael when she was my sexy arm candy to jacks conformation. T'was cute. Then the rabbi there almost married her mom, and it was funny. So after that we all got together at the drive in. There were like 20 kids and it was cool. Mr. and Mrs. Smith was on, but i didnt actually see much. We lit up the hookah at the drive in and it was lots of fun. Then a few kids came back to my house to play big kid games, walks, and fielding. It was nice, except some people don't grasp the idea of a night walk. Then they went home the next morning and I had brunch with Jack and alice. it was nice. It's kinda like I've taken keith's spot in their family while he's gone. its ammusing. 

SO that night nate came into town randomly. We hung around with ben and played cards, which was nice to get the boys together. The next day, we hung ut with skaggs for a bit, then played (half) T-ball. It was nice, cause I got a phone call that both made me ammused and pissed me off at the same time. Grrrr. Then nate and I went out for our secret night that shall never be discussed. The next day we hung around for a while, then had lots os miscommunication, which let to fun in the evening. yey fun. Nate and I had our bonding night wich included cigars, orange soda, opposums, almost getting mugged, and other such things. He left home tonight, cvause he ha a 8 am. doctors appt. so now I'm all alone...

Things I leaned since I last posted
1. History repeats itself.
2. Clifton and Gahanna have some similar traits.
3. SOme times you have to take one for the team to aviod awkardness.
4. I love Molly Zwelling.
5. I like passionate kisses goodbye.
6. I remembered why I stopped liking random hooking-up, and why I hadn't done it in a year.
7. Some people aren't smart enough to learn form their mistakes. 

I think that's it for now.
Much love,
danny

P.S. Oh, I got a job. Im at goodwill again this summer...yey-ish....
P.P.S. OK, so is didn't check my LJ in 6 days and only 3 new posts were up from my friends. Quit slackin team, i need you for amusement."

Meh...

Hmm, so life is good. I got a Nina Visit last night and It was everything I thought it could be. I picked her up from JJ's house, then we went off to skyline for a wonderful dinner. From there, we went off to the Zwelling's house. While there, I ""helped with"" (practicallyy wrote) molly's college essay. It was kinda funnny, it was like I was playing teacher, which I of course do not mind. Nina was off playing the their friend Zack. He's pretty bad about PDA, so i think he should be lightly casturated, but thats ok. Then from there, Nina and I came back to my house, and went ""Shopping"" with my sister. WE bought spirits for the evening and Cookie dough. SO when Ben Goldenberg came over he saw nina and I on my couch eating cookie dough watchin Lady and the Tramp. He literally checked for my balls twice. So anyways, later on in the evening, We went out on my roof and did what 3 adults would do at 12:30 at night on a roof. After we had been fulfilled by my roof, we took a nice stroll around my neighborhood. We ended up laying in a field at 3 am, all half passed out and staring at the clouds/stars. Then we wanered back to my room where we all passed out in no time. I got to sleep with nina, and for some reason I always sleep better next to her then anyone else. But in the morning she baked the ramiander of the cookie dough so we had cookies. I the asked her to marry me and she agreed. So im now engaged to nina, which solves the problem of the earlier entry. No kids until she's 24, which i can totally agree with. Yey. good visit.

Ok, off to do less important things, or maybe more important things. we shal see...

"event","Ok, so a lot of things are happenign in my life, both internally and externally. so I'll fill in where appropriate.
Friday night was really awsome. First of all, the way the do shabbat is really cool. I want to have shabbat like that When I raise a family. IT was not too long, but it was really nice. Probibly my favorite part of it was there was this part about the role of the wife in the husbands life and the families, and it was really cute. Me and the little ones played games for a while, then took a walk, then to waffle house. It  was a good evening. Odd feelings though, to be skopen of later.
Saturdasy, i got up early and prepared my self in accoring wedding attire.justin came by around 10, and the two of us left to go to youngstown for the Wedding of Nick and Rachel. The ride up was really nice cause I havent had a good talk with justin since school let out. So after about 3 hours, we arrived at this tiny Catholic church. And we were like the first ones there. It was weird. But soon more people I knew came, Lots of Chi PHi's (like 15) and a few other OWU'ers that were friends of the couple. 
Let me say this. I LOVE WEDDINGS. I love seeing people dressed up in their best, I love all the happiness that surrounds the wedding. Every guest at a wedding is exstatic and cheery. There are bright flowers everywhere abd everyone is smiling. YEY. It makes me want to get married and settle down. I'm Tired of My loose ways. I'm ready to get a wife and have kids, be a father, watch my children grow up to me wonderful human beings. Things like that. 

SO If ANYONE who reads this wants to be my wife, let me know, and We'll see what we can work out

SO nick looked clean and Handsome and Rachel looked lovely and the ceremony, despite Catholic, was really cool and fun. It was the first time I had ever seen communion, which was odd. After the wedding, all the brothers went back to terry's house(a Bro of ours) and hung out for a bit, as his mother forced alcohol and snacks down our throats. It was pretty funny. Then all 20 of us (chi Phi's and dates) went to go see Madigascar. It was like fate, cause i was in line and had no cash. Then i found a 5 in 1 pocket, and a 1 in the other pocket, and the ticket was $6. It was prertty crazi. then I saw the movie(except for a 10 minute nap) and it was pretty good. Then we went off the the reception. IT was inseide this place in a forest and it was really pretty. The reception was fun. It could have been more fun if i wasn't THe DD for Walton and Manner (the Best man and another groom'sman). But the best part was When Jackson got the Idea to Put on Hava Nagila And throw them up in the chairs. And we did, and it was sweet. There were like 60 people on the dance floor (keep in mind, CATHOLIC). And It was Awsome CAuse Nick and Rachel Had no Idea what was going on. The party got kicked off from there. Everyone was up dancing and stuff it was sweet. After the party, we all crashed at terry's and it was sweet.
Next day, we drove back(me, justin and Ira), got some skyline. It was sweet. Then I went frizbee golfing with Ira and Penney(A Brother of mine who had just graduated. After that, Ira and I ventured out to Bexley where all sorts of people were getting together.

There were a bunch of kinds there and it was cool to an extent. I mean there were lots there (AKK, Johnsons, Jack, Jack(ted), Molly, Daniel, Emily, Hirsh, Anna, Hannah, And Ira and I). This is when I get into the Goffy Stuff. I've been having this weird realization. Im fucking old! Im going to be a sophmore in college. And I feel it. I feel like and old man whose watching the children play in the park as he reads his newspaper, and thinking to himself, ""Oh, to be that young again."" I mean going from seeing a friend married, and hanging out with people who I am the youingest one there, and the 2nd youngest was turning 21 in 2 months. And then I go and hang out with liek 10 people, and 1 of them even over the age of 18. There's just so much difference there. I'm at the point where I feel more comfortable around people 5 and 6 years older then me, then with people 1 or 2 years younger. And im having a hard time with It. It is all of a sudden so hard to relate to a few people who last year were huge parts of my life, and its such a hard concept. ITs like im having a falling out with my own maturity. ANd im finally realizing what ben and devon were going through last year. And its Just a weird feeling. I just feel so awkward around the younger crowd, and there isnt much i can do to change that. Now there are some exceptions to that, cause there's a few peopel I can still relate with, but still, it's a little wierder. SO that's whats the major issue in my life right now. Because I by no means want to cut these people out of my life, it's just kinda wierd not being able to bond on the same level as I'm used too. *sigh* i just dont know. SOi guess that is the end of this rant.

Today was good though. I got up and went to skagg's Grad party, which was fine. I had been there, so we felt old together. He freaked out a bit though, cause he realized he's almost 20. Thats 1/3 older then some of the kids there. And that's fucking old. After the party, we went back to ben's and made pizza, played old school nintendo and began to write a movie we plan to do this summer. I'm excited for it and it should be a lot of fun. And now i've been up writing this for about an hour, and ima go to bed cause I have to take my sister to work at 9 am tomarrow and its now 3. So im off to bed. 
Much love kiddo's,
danny


P.S. If you fall into the younger kids category, it does not mean I love you any less. Its Just me feeling old."

"event","Im really bad at this whole updating thingy.  Hmm, week was good. Cinci was awsome. I did everything i wanted to do, saw (almost) everyone I wanted to see, had bonding time with the boys. t'was great.
Tuesday I had a B-day party for lindsey at my house. It was sweet. I cooked all day, and things turned out good. It's nice entertaining people. I got good bonding time with ben and skaggs that night. I liked it.
Wed. night i got picked up by katie and we went to the airport to get Ira and naina, who happened to be coming in on the same flight. after that, we went up to campus where manner and penney now have a place and hung out with some of the boys. After that, I had some good bonding time with katie, and that was good too.
last nighjt was the night dedicated to the end of freedom Nick. It started out with 3 hours at the shi-sha lounge, then back up to wesleyan where we smoked cubans. It was a quite nice evening. And there were like 9 brothers sleeping in 1 room and up all night telling war stories and other fun things. It was kinda like I-week all over again. I loved it. 
Im excited for the weekend. I'm  at the Zwelling tonight for shabbat with emily(yey), alana kk, and Johnson. Im looking foreward to it. Then at like 9 the next morning i get picked up by justin then off to nick's final demise, AKA, wedding. Shall be fun, cause i love weddings, and may be interesting because of some theory Jackson has on single women and weddings. We shall all see. 

OK sorry that wans't very detailed, but i didnt want to write a disertation or anything. 
Much love,
Danny"

"event","hmm. so its been a while since my last update. Just gettin lazy. IT's not like im on the computer everynight til 3 am because i have nothing better to do or anything. Summers in full swing now. 
When my parents come home, they may ask what i did that day. it usually goes something like this:

""Well, i got up around 1. Sat around for a few hours, scavenged through the firdge, avioding a full meal of any kind. watched TV, Listened to music. Sat around. played minesweeper (my latest vice). Sat around. Took a shower at about 4. watched the simpsons. Umm..? oh, im going out again tonight..""

Then they ask ""did you find a job yet?""

And I reply, ""I called this one guy, but i got a machine"" (me making it sounds like i put hours of effort into it.

And such is summer. I'm looking into lanscaping. Yey manual Labor. But it has its perks. 
1. In the sun all day (though i dislike the heat, a nice tan couldn't hurt)
2. I dig holes for a living (Kinda menial, but gain muscle)
3. Work alot (Prolly wont have to ork past 5, so nights are free)
4. Good pay (8-9$ an hour, not too bad. yey $)

so thats that.

On tuesday, I had a really goofy night. At about 11:30, My sister Kory and I started making cheesecake and drinking. SO that was really funny. They were getting drunk rather quickly, while i was trying do down a six pack in an hour (i failed). So they did most the cooking, but I halped out a bit. When the cheesecake was done, the girls realized they hadn't made the raspberry sauce yet. well, at this point, Kory was going up to bed, and my sister was sitting on the floor and not really getting up to soon. So me being the most sober out of all of us (I was 7 beers deep at the time, which isnt that sober). SO i've got this pot with sugar and water in it. I start throwing all sorts of stuff in, no measurements, just taking a handful of this a dash of that. And not to brag, but it turned out amazing. SO i felt very accomplished. 
On a side note, its VERY funny the kind of conversations that siblings can have when their drunk. My sister and I are very open with our lives with one another, but some of this stuff was just a few too many details to be a sober conversation. OY VEY.

On wendsday, I went to see stomp with jack. It was fucking sweet, despite me falling asleep half way though while they were doing stuff in dim lights. We had 2nd row seats, and this hawaiian guy got hallf naked, it was a good time.

TOnight was really awsome as well. I had a Date with Molly Z and it was a trully magical evening. We went to this place called the Taj Mahal for indian food. I have no idea what we had(Molly ordered for us), but it was wonderfully delicious. Then afterwards, we Went to a place called ZenCha, a kinda fancy tea place. And im smart, cause since it's in ""the Short Notrh"", I assume it's north of everything in columbus, which was a false assumption. So i pretty much went to Alana KK's house and realized i was goin the wrong way. yey me : ). But the Tea was great. WE got this milky, green sweet tea and it was an awsome color. yey. Then when we were leaving, WWIII storm was going on outside, so i gave molly a piggy back ride all the way to the car. It was a really cute and fun evening. I love my molly dates : ). 
O O O, we're having trouble  thinking of our next date place, cause we're doing this exotic food thing (2 chinese, 1 sushi, and 1 indian) If you have suggestions, let me know : ).

This weekend is going to be sweet. Tomarrow night (fri) there is a party thats going on at JJ's house. He's an old school NFTY guy, so it will be me playing with the old timers. Gonna be good fun. 
Sat im going down to Cincinatti. The only bad  part is that we're only in town for one night, and there is like 4000 people to see. Not only do I have the usual Jew crowd, I have a crap load of school friends there too. So we shall see how this will go.

Ok. Wow. That was a lot more then I expected. Well thats my update.
Much love kiddo's,
danny"

Its just a lot of stuff to deal with right now, and to think in a week, all of this will be over... it kinda rediculious. 

Well  dont know what to end this with...
OH 2 weeks from this weekend i will prolly be in cinci to visit people I love.

Much love kiddo's,
danny"

"event","<P><FONT size=2>So this one of the most amazing weekends ever. Things were things on fri, but deffinatly wonderful. We got back in town at about 3. I hung around until about 7:30 when i started preparing for passover, aka getting rid of all my grain stuff, which included about 4 shots of rum, and a beer or two. Then I got all dressed up for CHI PHI FORMAL!! I went with <FONT size=3><A href=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y177/dookiedayez/b12010f2.jpg"">Katie</A></FONT>&nbsp;and she looked all <A href=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y177/dookiedayez/IM000064.jpg"">pretty</A> and stuff. <A href=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y177/dookiedayez/IM000047.jpg"">Justin went with&nbsp;Kara and Biz</A>, well walton was offically Biz's date, but wasn't around for the sexy pic.&nbsp;Formal was absolutly wonderful. It was like a small prom (aprox. 60 people) but everyone u want to be there is. All your friends and all their dates are all friends, and you do not have to worry about how goofy u look dancing, or what other people think of you. It was just so much fun. <A href=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y177/dookiedayez/IM000058.jpg"">Ira got trashed and it was funny</A>. And one of the best parts was when a brother of mine, <A href=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y177/dookiedayez/IM000085.jpg"">CK</A>, proposed to his now fiance in front of all of the brothers and she said yes and they were all <A href=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y177/dookiedayez/IM000065.jpg"">happy</A>. Then all of the seniors danced and were cute and stuff, ecpecially <A href=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y177/dookiedayez/IM000086.jpg"">dae and shaefer</A>. It was a great night. Then I went back to the dorm and spent the night upstairs : ). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The next morning I got up early and wrote my speech for Zeta. Zeta is the chapter historian.&nbsp;Tey take pics and did other fun sttuff like that. I got elected later that day. It's sweet. Then I went home for a great passover dinner. What could be better?! I have no idea. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>So great so great.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>oh yeah, Pictures are a featuer I learned how to use? fun stuff, eh?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Much love,<BR>danny<BR></P></FONT>

I haven;t slept yet, but yet im not on the verge of death... its really weird. 
SO i tryied something new last night. I took an aderol, whcih for those who do not know, is ADD medication, and I ended up easily able to stay up the whole night, and I think I wrote my best paper of the year.. Maybe this is thrying to tell me something? Maybe there is a reason that I can only focus well from 12-10am? it could be ADD!?
I dontknow, but i think i deserve a nap beofre work tonight, cause i am quite tired.

"event","ok. So i realized a coupla days ago that i have been neglecting a part of my recent history in my journal. So i figured it'd take the time to add in what I left out. So hwat I eft out was not for a reason, just my absent minded-ness. So What/who I left out was Katie. Katie is the lady in my life. She has been for the past nine weeks, and I have to say, I enjoi her company. He have fun together. It is an odd relationship, because she graduates a month from now, so our time together is limited. And we both agree that we end when summer starts, which takes a lot of stress off, kinda. she'll be off to grad school in boston, and i'll be off to the holyland and my sophmore year here at owu. deffinatly different paths. So we are just enjoing the time we have together until the inevitable happens. So thats the way it is... 
well, im off to class.

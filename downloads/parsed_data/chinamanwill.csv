"event","Man I wonder why I don't ever update this thing. Anyway, been looking into the whole law school deal. Pretty tough, gonna have to manage at least a B+ average as well as score high on the LSAT's. Trying to keep it in california, so Aiming for USC Law (which is the 28th hardest law school to get into...Cal 3rd, UCLA 7th, UCD, 38th) UCD by the way does have a law school and it's pretty good actually. 

But Aside from all that, thinking about majors, along the lines of Economics, or Sociology with Law and Society emphasis, Communications, or Economy, Justice, and Society (minor). Yeah, whatever, have to pick up the pace and shit to get all that done though.

On a side note, prolly gonna plan a trip down to LA/SD sometime between the last 2 weekends of April and the first weekend of May. I'll see how that all pans out."

"event","Yeah so it turns out that my girlfriend is suppose to be some horny nympho. Well I've been goin out with her for 9 months and I guess the whole world knew but me. Heh, shit, who the hell have I been dating. Anyway, enough with that.

So I'm betting on this weekends playoffs games. Titans to win and Eagles/Packers to score over 45 combined I think it was."

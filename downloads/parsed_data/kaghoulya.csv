"event","As some of you may know, today is April the 7th a somewhat important day to me. Why? If this day wasn't important I wouldn't exist. Today is my birthday. 
It is also minorly important because every year without fail I have written in my journal on this day. Today I am 17 years of age. My brother thought I was 19. I think he ment it as a joke. Technically if I still had my old comm tech computer I would be 22 today because it was permanently fixated on the year 2010. 

I got season 1 and 2 of friends so far from my parents... I'm exchanging the for... Spike! haha I love him. Oh and a gift card for wal-mart from my aunt and uncle. 

Tonight's my party. I hope the weather gets better because we were gonna party in the back of my truck cab at the drive in. I mean that's fun. All blanketty goodness. And you know usual teenage hormonal stupidity. 

I wore a skirt today. Take that society. UP-YOURS! I have to say though I'm a cheater. I wore shorts. But there tiny and insignificant. 

I've gotten three birthday hugs so far not including... family. I plan to get a lot more even if I have to tackle people and crush there lungs to the ground. I want my hugs!

Smosh rules. They do all the shit I love. 

Anyway... only take Viagra if you need it. 

Have a totally awesome day everybody. Plus it's friday."

No, really, I'm livid. 

So here are the facts. We had this awesome weekend planned to cosplay and go to anime north. I was so utterly, utterly ecstatic. I got up with a smile on my face today I even planned our totally awesome cosplay skit that I actually did in a small space about the size of a small dog. 

And then I heard the news. Oh ho ho watch the steam spurt out of my god damn ears. 

Well you selfish twit, may I spit in your goddamn face you dick. I mean it would have been so totally awesome. Well you ruined it for all of us, how does it feel? You feelin good? I bet you would have had a great time, but no I'll just be the lazy ass that I am and ruin it for US ALL. I mean what's the problem with having a little extra spending money and having a totally awesome time with the gang. Is it to much to ask to get off your skinny ass for a few hours to do some good manual labour. 

If that's not enough Minot was really excited about going up. She really wanted to cosplay with us, to go in the pool, to damn well party. Hell, I bet she would have liked looking at all the amazingly hot men. And the boys who yaoi it up. 

And oh look Sal was enjoying himself, and just because you brought Minot down to your uber unfun level now he's only going for one day as well. 

And boo hoo to you when you realize that your Saturday is going to be total shit. I bet your going to wake up at like 11 or something drive down an hour and some odd minutes to wait in line for a good 2-4 hours to enjoy yourself for three hours to go home and feel totally unsatisfied. 

What's the problem with staying with friends for a weekend and enjoying yourself. Who cares if you have to spend some money it's not like you really spend a lot during the year anyway.   

Well, have a good day. I'm not sure if I will."

"event","For the past few entries I have been rushed by the teacher to get out of the computer room, so my entries have been cut off. Abruptly. So last weekend we went to go watch the new Amityville horror and for some reason I wasn't even scared. I mean there was only one part I couldn't watch. The part with the finger in the shot, that was so sick. But then guess what, I had to go home after that because I WAS FREAKIN GROUNDED! So I cleaned on Saturday and I don't really remember Sunday. At all. I guess it was just that bad. I had a Fashion show on Wednesday for charity. I think it was for little kids so I'm glad I did it. Today being Friday right? I'm going to my Grandparents who just came back from Florida. Saturday something's going on with Ivo Coia's dad, something or other and my family was invited which I just heard about yesturday. On Sunday, the last day of my groundage. OHH, my brother just bought the Blade trilogy. I've seen the first one and I really liked it, but now I gotta see the others. I think I saw the ending of Blade 2 though, which wasn't a very good thing, oh well. He also walked in and got me mgs3 (METAL GEAR BABY!) I can't buy it because it's rated mature. So my present from him has been bought. I only played it for ten minutes, It's so hard!!! I mean 1 and 2 were easy! But then they just have to put a stamina bar in this version, and make you hunt wild animals in the jungle while trying to stay hidden from enemy soldiers. What I found the most amusing about the whole beginning minutes was that Snake, said his real name was Jack, and Jack was the sexy blonde from the 2nd mgs. I knew there were gay connections! Snake can't forget about Jack! Haha. So my weekend will consist of cleaning, visiting, and playing video games, maybe watching movies, though I'm still saving to watch Vanilla Sky with Natasha. So Perfect Blue and Blade it is! Well anyway, I hope everyone else enjoys their weekends!"

This year, I will be 16. My birthday party is tomorrow. We're hopefully going to watch horribly dubbed martial arts movies and experience the craziness that usually goes along with parties concerning me and my friends. As long as I or anyonbe else doesn't break anything It'll be alright. We might rent actual movies that have some meaning rather then
""I fight you, you bastard.""

Maybe I can even find that horrible movie entitled ""An American Ninja."" Now that movies just horrid.

Oh,oh maybe I can find ""Harold the Duck!"" That movie is the death spawn of this world. That's 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back. You might even have potentially bad dreams for the next two weeks. Sorry.

Well I'm done both exams now, history and japanese, hopefully I breezed through them. I had a super adventure with KATIE yesTURDay. I unfortunately got the problem, the red dot of satan, a girls shit problem. That I shall one day laugh at, if I don't die of blood loss. I didn't have anything on me, Katie suggested the wonderful use of shittastical school 1 ply toilet paper. I scoffed then pulled out a whole shit load with a smile and I really did feel like yelling ""Take that you bastard janitors and school system, if only you would by 2 ply maybe I wouldn't have to pull out so friggin much!"" So that's when our journey began.

The Journey~ Of a second life time, missing only one member of our trio, the Tosh.

We set out to none other then SHOPPERS DRUG MART! To buy, rags/pads/sanitory friggin napkins... bagel bites, cheese sauce and no chips, and ice cream! 

W00T!

We spent the rest of our time in the Comm tech room eating our precious bagel bites and wallowing in their warmth. Basking in the glory of their bagelness... of their biteness, we were transfered to a world we've never seen, a paradise unheard of, heaven on earth, the land supreme of Bagel Bites.

Thank you Katie, for your wonderful words on bagel bites they deserve it all!

Thank you Tanya, I'd go as far as to describe them as orgasmic and delightful, but I think that may be a little too much.

Ohhh, Orgasmic.

I went home sick yesturday afternoon and my mom wanted me to stay home today but I wanted to come back just incase Natasha was here so she would have a partner for gym. It sucks not having a partner. I found out this morning before I came to ""this"" place that Natasha had called last night. Sorry I didn't call back! My brother went out last night so he only told me the message today. 

 I'm so glad Jixy~ has a boyfriend now! You seem so happy with him. Even though I know there will be a few bumps along the way, since that's how life is.

God just had to add speed bumps didn't he. 

I hope this lasts, I love seeing Jix with those little smiles. Fills me up with joy and happiness as well.

I was thinking of having a huge thingy this weekend. Possibly Saturday, possibly Sunday at Firemens park. We'll be together in two teams, so two different ""armies."" It'll be like the tobagganing thing at the end except funnier. More people with two teams, two bases and a hell of a lot of snowballs.

It'll be fun, promise. 

For this entry I don't really feel like going back and recaping all that has happened since... June 6th so I won't. I forget most of it anyway. I got a horrible memory. So I'll just randomly ramble about random shit that comes to mind. 

This last year has been complete and other weather hell for everyone all over the world, and the only thing we can do is give as much back in return. My heart goes out to all those people in the Middle east right now. 

I can't wait for this semester to be over, it started out okay, okay as in it's school and school can't be worth much. One of these days I want to act like that guy from office space and have a conversation like this.

T: I really don't like school, I think I'm not going to go.
Someone: So your going to drop out?
T: No, I'm just not going to go.
Someone: So... what'll you do about your education?
T: You know, I never really did like learning, I won't do that either.

That would be sweet, and then some random guy named Milton who we shall label as the guy at Myer who holds his books in front of him like a robot burns down the school.

But then my dream will die, when I have to go to another school and wait for Myer to be rebuilt.

Damn school board ruins everything. THEY even took PETER RABBIT out of our HIGHSCHOOL library, if that's not the shittiest thing you've ever heard. We're a freaking highschool who can't read Peter Rabbit because ""The rabbits are only UPPERCLASS rabbits"" What kind of bullshit reason is that.

When do people actually give a rats ass about anyone under upperclass, when disaster strikes and thats about is. Right now, to anyone who has ever helped someone else, I'm giving my complete and utter respect to you. You are the people who matter. If you haven't it's a time to start right. I can understand people who can't give, because problems they have in their own lives. I'm going to respecft them for being able to hold themselves up. I'll stick by those people as well. That's the world. Who needs really expensive, houses, cars and stuff. We all wish for it, it's a dream of everyone. But if we get there we have to know how to give back in return. So the vicious cycle of things can be stopped for the first time.

And now that that's over gym is going to begin shortly, in about 5 minutes so I'm going to wait in front of Natasha's science room door and surprise her good. You know, it's my job^^

Love Ya, Jix"

"event","Step 1: I've been given some more time, over my vast complaining and endurance in the art of computer, my time has been extended for me. I am no miraculously able to update both my devart account and livejournal once a week without being kicked off! Though I haven't been able to go onto msn yet, not like the bloody thing really works. So now that has been said here I am *watches tumble weed blow over path* Hi.

Step 2: Well Anime North that was like one and a half weeks ago now, was pretty darn good. I cosplayed as Gaara (I have been referenced as Chick Gaara) and Reno (FF7). What I got.

Copic Markers: gray, teal blue, skin white, neutral gray, cadmium red, Yellow ochre, Cool shadow, Antwerp Blue (hey Antwerp's in Holland, that's pretty cool! *cough* I'm dutch.) Lilac, Mignonette, and Pinkish white.

Almost all of saucywench's prints
someone else's prints.
posters
pins
this cute little stuffed gray thing with an adorable happy face *SQUEEE!*
A Paine figure
A kakashi figure
I think I'm missing something, but that's okay.

Step 3: Personalness, my mom's going into surgery on Monday, I might miss the day I don't know if she wants me to or not. She said she might want me there so I don't know yet. My brother's results haven't come in from his MRI yet but he's probably going to have to get double surgery on both knees and then find a desk job. But they'll both be okay, nobodies worried, there are always obstacles in life that you have to face, sometimes you get some help but sometimes you have to find your own way around right?

Step wonderful 4: Harry Potter and the ""Prisoner"" of Azkaban. This is one of those movies that will be listed up there. It was better then the first two and I'm really happy with the change of director. It was Jix, your_ad_here, and me. Later to be joined by 2 more of the gang. Now it was going pretty normal, we got into the movie and I went to go get our food, for some unknown reason I grabbed a lot of straws. So I went back to where the group was and gave them there food. Your_ad_here a.k.a Katie got to share drinks with both me and Jix a.k.a Natasha. So I accidently drank from her straw and she asked me if I had anymore. I don't know how my sentence came out anymore or what I sounded like but I replied simply with ""I have a lot of straws."" Annnd just because were really sick, perverted people we somehow managed to completely kill that sentence and turn it into a pretty sickening 20 minute conversation. We also managaed to bring it all the way into the previews and comment on how many straws each person or animal had. Some guys just didn't have any straw. Now just because of that simple incident I couldn't take the movie lightly and just because (Katie's wonderful knowledge) the director had formerly directed a borderline porno, we tended to notice very perverted things. So here we were pointing out very perverted things for a so to speak family movie. The WHOLE movie long. Not that I minded it was quite interesting. I also hope everyone else enjoys the movie it was quite good past all the perverted comedic events.

Step wonderful friggin five: Updates in dev are being done, only three. A wallpaper, dreamscape and my 1337 kiriban. And with that I'll be gone till next weekend, or whenever I can pry my clammy sickening hand onto the keyboard or anywhere near the computer. Now to leave in freaky fashion

I was slightly startled this mroning. For some reason I think my parents think that when you turn 15 it's alright to say weird sexual things. Like you were born because we wnted to have sex. And I was born because my parents wanted to have sex... I mean where the hell did that come from. And now my brothers gone all lovey. I mean he came home from work hugged me. Said happy Birthday, said I'll get my present tomorrow, then hugged me again. A half an hour went by came back in and hugged me, wished me a happy birthday, kissed my forehead and left. 

Tomorrow's my party good times! So what are we going to do? You never know when your with me. It's like unpredictable. One second it's movies next it's let's play carpet racess attck of the rats! (uhh sorry bad bad name)

I mean who's even heard of it, reslly!? Not many people, I can't believe that their even able to stay up and running. they have this really shitty web site. But yeah it wouldn't be so bad if it loaded what I wanted it to. It won't load Gaia, it took ten minutes for the past two days, and it's still says 'This page is not available,' Fanfiction sites won't load. Google won't load. Livejournal is the only thing that's actually working. But other then that my day was good.

It was a buy out day, so you buy these little shitty purple things, but I didn't have to, since I got gym second period. So out of jix, Katie, Monnie, Kaitlyn, and I, I was technically the only one skipping since I didn't buy a ticket to skip class. Once we were out of school lunch was the best. We went to the grocery store, bought ice cream in those little tubs! Jix and I shared a cookie dough, damn it was good. We ate in a nearby park. Just put a happy part to the day, you know? Sunshine and Rainbows, and little pink elephants from Mars. Yes, they do exist! 

Now comparisons *laughs*

Santa: Is really a cannibal/pirate man who lives on a ship in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. His elves are his crew who carry around sticks and enjoy giving kids coal in all their little stockings for Chritsmas.
The tooth Fairy: Is really many fairies who like disco and bribe your parents to give you lots of sugar so your teeth rot and fall out. Thus, allowing them to buy high maintenence disco equipment.
Leprechauns: Are exactly what you think they are except their not short and have little orange beards, their tall and handsome. So what they wear hideously bright green suits and funny looking hats. These sexy Irish men could make anybody's day so much better. Find yourself one and your truly in for a pot of gold.
Easter Bunny: Oh so you thought the Easter Bunny is cute, eh? You thought it just jumped around giving chocolate to all the little boys and girls, well your so wrong! It's really a little blue martian in a bunny suit corrupting our minds with chocolate so he may one day rule the world in the form of one of mediocre leaders. Who knows what evils he will do to us then!

*cough* Now I suggest to you all to go find yourself a leprechaun and be happy for the rest of your lives.

Plans: Sleepover tomorrow.
Saturday: A bit of fun at my house then off to the Coia's for dinner.
Sunday: clean the hell out of my house for I am a lazy fool.

Naruto Fanart 
Anthology Cover

Anyway, now yesturday, twas a Saturday. I always do something with Jix on a Saturday. Now because she went to Toronto and it's sort of tradition that we ALWAYS get together on Saturdays. But now that she left I sort of felt that a part of my daily week was taken away and stepped on, then ground up and thrown to the winds. I was actually bored, I'm rarely ever bored. It was demeaning. So what do I do I search through my pockets and try and find something anything. So I found Ice_tamer's number. I called she was getting her hair done. That just about sent me into soooo.... what do I do? So I went online talked to your_ad_here. And waited... And then finally Monnie a.k.a Ice_tamer, comes on and says I can come over since she's babysitting. So I go, and watch Kenshin yet again, not like I mind it's great. Had a nice dinner, and had a good time. All things come to those who wait. Monnie's so cool.

Now it's Sunday, and I don't have to worry about anything. Well I always worry because I always feel bad about something todays no different. I missed Jix's call yesturday and I felt so bad. If I had her cellphone number I could have called her I'll have to ask for that next time. It'd be great if I asked a lot of people that. But now that's it's Sunday I'm not bored, because I always stay home on Sunday and I'm use to it. And to tell the truth just not seeing Jix for that one Saturday affected me probably more then I can even fathom. I'll be sure to get her next call inless something happens today, but it's drab out again. Not that I mind something about these days intrigue me for some reason. I can't wait to see Jix on Monday, or maybe tonight who knows. I get to see Stephanie maybe on Tuesday, and I don't know about the rest of the week. 

I'll just have to wait. Wait and see just how far the winds can lead me."

I'm applied, A minus in gym, didn't expect anymore then that, B plus in geography... also applied but I didn't hand some junk in, and lastly A in math which I think is great since this year for some eason all the concepts are really hard. Or I'm not concentrating enough and all the numbers merge, such as 60 is after 30... Or other things that tend to happen.

Today was an odd day, everything just seemed to merge together. One class would say something then in the next class it would be said again. Or something along those lines. Let's see now, oh the art show for art club! The art teacher doesn't want anyone to do anime, so for me whats the next best thing animals! Now here's where I'm going to need your opinion. I can do a fontal picture of a lynx in winter with many a few staw grasses or fallen trees or something like that, OR I can do a sideways picture of a lynx chasing a rabbit with birch a forest in the background. Or I can try both if ones harder then the other. 

Now that, that's over, I'd like to thank my best friend Jix for changing my layout for , my livejournal. It looks great! I am so Canadian!

Then that's all until the end of the year. So after saying that, this week I'm stuck with my brother, but strangely he's not using dishes this time aound and not leaving horrible messes everywhere. Even more suprising then that is the fact that I'm cleaning up to. Probably the only time I am clean. Well I don't care about hygiene and all that, but yeah. 

Oh yeah it's March! One more week then March Break. I don't even really know why but today seemed longer then the rest, maybe because I wasn't that tired. Next term, which would be grade ten for me, I'm taking: Japanese, Art, Gym, English, Mathematics, Civics and careers, Science, and History. Extra selection: Dramatic Arts.

It's gloomy outside."

"event","So it's been awhile hasn't it. And yet again an update at Jix's what an amusing surprise ^^. Anyway, lately I've been doing homework my parents want me to do more chores. Saying it's a ladies job in which I reply but I'm not a lady. Which brings back more old statements that I should have been born a man. But other then that I've been good. Had a good time at Monni's birthday party. It was great! And after that I've been thinking whether or not I should submit a manga portfolio to Tokyopop. It wouldn't hurt to try right? Probably do my Painted Blood story or some sub plots to it I haven't really decided. That's it for now."

Meaghan searched through the darkness the only thing guiding her was her hand following the twisting walls of the cavern. The only noises heard were the reverberating sound of footsteps and the echoing of tiny droplets of water. ""When will this maze end?"" Meaghan questioned pausing for a moment to take a break. ""I could really use some company!"" Meaghan yelled and was rewarded with an echo. Meaghan started to run her one hand getting sore from the friction on the wall. She tripped over the smallest of stones and tumbled to a halt in the center of the hall. ""Ouch"" Meaghan said softly clutching her bleeding leg. Even if there was no light the blood could be felt on the side of her leg. It was a deep gash, about as big as a bullet and a few inches in length. ""Natasha.Tanya.Stephanie.Diar.Kyoi.Rue.Adam!"" Meaghan yelled helplessly. ""Help me.anyone"" Meaghan sobbed into her leg.

Adam drifted in and out of consciousness. His eye's completely blurry of his surroundings. When his eyes focused he wished they hadn't. The sun had temporary blinded him ""shit"" Adam whispered running his hands over his eyes. When Adam regained his sight he took a look around. ""This can't get any worse"" Adam held his hand to his head. He was sure not to let the other move. Adam was located on the edge of a plank of wood attached to the thinnest of poles too many feet to count in the air. Adam took a quick glance over the edge and pulled back quickly holding in his lunch. ""How the hell do I get out of this one, jump to my death?"" Adam asked himself sarcastically. Adam crossed his hands over his chest and quickly put them back on the edge of the wood. ""Oh god"" Adam whispered. The plank began to rotate slowly but it had started.

""Why do you have Natasha?"" Kyoi asked glaring at the wolf. ""Why should I tell you? But she will be a tasty treat when you die!"" The wolf growled low standing his ground. It would have been a weird sight if anyone would, have been there to witness it. A man with black demon wings floating in mid air with a growling blue wolf opposite him with gigantic claws. ""I don't intend to die"" Kyoi smirked switching his sword hand to his left. ""You're a fool Demon"" The wolf raised his head in the air and howled to the now red full moon. ""What the hell?"" Kyoi flew back a couple feet and looked at the transforming wolf. His normal yellow eyes changed into a ghostly red as his body slowly shrunk into that of a human. The wolf had become a man about six feet in height, his light blue hair went all the way down to the bottom of his back. He still had the fangs and relatively long fingernails. Amazingly he had changed his fur into clothing. He wore a blue shirt that tied up near the collar and ripped blue pants that were held up by his long, furry, blue, tail. He looked so damn confident! Kyoi cursed the night and floated towards the ground, his wings flowing back into the edge of his shoulder blades. ""So you will fight me like a man?"" the wolf growled, ""you should at least know the name of your killer before you die, you can call me Wolfgang.""

Natasha yelled at herself in her head 'He isn't real. I gotta get away from him.' Natasha tried to push away but her body wouldn't comply. Kyoi held her tighter sensing her uneasiness. She tried to get away again but to no avail her body just wouldn't move. ""You're not real"" Natasha said, ""You're not Kyoi, I don't love you."" Kyoi looked at her and pushed away. A dark green light encircled Natasha, whipping around her long brown hair. Her clothes changed from the black shirt and blue jeans into, the white cloak that fastened at the shoulders. A sash, underneath tied the green shirt, together, the sash also held up the white pants. Her boots were black and had spikes around the top. In her right hand she held her weapon the thin sword that was in a beautifully decorated sheath. The light disappeared and she was gone.

Stephanie swam faster not caring about the ache in her muscles. All that was in her mind was getting out of there and getting her weapon. Stephanie hummed the song I choose by Offspring as she swam ever closer to the lit object. She came to the lit object and lifted it to her face. They were just some rusty pieces of junk. Some rusted blades and what looked like a bow. When she was about to set them down light surrounded her not white light either a light transparent blue. Her long red hair flared out behind her as a white cloak fastened to her neck. Underneath was a white loose shirt and shorts with a thin black line running down the sides. Black tight pants were underneath the shorts and black boots went up to her knees. The rusted daggers went into a blue bag that strapped over her shoulders. The broken bow was now repaired and was a white colour with a dragon pattern engraved in the side. She saw one last look at the glowing fish and then she was gone.

Diar was on the floor clutching his hand. Darkness was flowing off his hand in waves 'I have to get away from this door, my weapons not going to be there.' Diar got up slowly and walked back to the main entrance. ""What's wrong?"" Niaka asked from a corner, which she had sat down in. ""The door back there"", Diar pointed with his good hand at the black door down the hall. ""That is the little piece of my mind that shadow controls, when you and the others defeat him it will be gone if you don't and he captures us again it will only grow and consume"" Niaka said now behind Diar examining his hand. ""Niaka?"" Dair asked looking into her face, ""How do you know all that?"" Niaka smiled at home when you live in a part of someone's soul you know more then they do."" Diar nodded and got up ""My weapons not here I have to continue my search."" Niaka got up after him ""Good luck Diar,"" with that said Niaka walked into the walls of her mind.

Rue jumped back seeing Shadows body on the cold dark floor. ""How did you get so strong?"" Shadow coughed out blood going onto the floor. ""I've been alive for more then a thousand years I didn't spend all that time sitting on my ass in the middle of nowhere"" Rue smiled gripping his sword tighter. ""I've been alive longer then you and am far wiser,"" Shadow said getting up his wounds closing. ""You are just a shadow that possesses other peoples bodies, your no challenge"" Rue smirked readying himself. ""You will regret your words boy!"" Shadow yelled running towards Rue.

""What's this?"" Tanya said leaning closer to the water. The tip of her nose touched the water making her flinch back and rub it off. When she opened her eyes again she saw a horrid site. ""What the hell!"" Tanya yelled grabbing the rocky ledge and leaning close to the water again. It was revolting; Shadow had kidnapped her again yet the images were different, different setting, a completely different place. 'Was this the future?' Tanya asked herself as she stood up and paced. It seemed that if the image was the future Shadow would probably be going to, ""the bastard!"" Tanya looked momentarily back in the water and saw the look of pure hatred in Rues eyes.

Suko sat by her large mirror a gentle smile on her face. She had been sitting there for the past hour starring at Rues progress in getting his sword. Two of the girls had already succeeded in getting their weapons. They would be transported back to earth where they will have to face Cran. Rue looked up into the eyes of Shadow and smiled. Suko smiled at this, even while bleeding he can still smile. Two demons ran into the rooms one had bright red hair, red eyes, and a dark skin. Her wings were retracted behind her back. The second was a male, with black hair, deep blue eyes, and dark skin. His wings were not visible behind his long spiked black hair, since they shrunk when necessary. ""What do you two want,"" Suko spat narrowing her blank eyes. ""Shadow commanded us Milady"" The female demon bowed low. ""Leave here at once!"" Suko stood up her hands going in front of her directed towards them, ""if you value your life!""

Cran advanced towards Brock his smile widening ""I'll be the last man you'll ever see."" Cran put his index and middle fingers on to Brocks forehead. Cran laughed as he let the energy flow through his body directed to his two fingers. He was stopped suddenly when he felt a disturbance in the air. Two of the girls appeared out of nowhere a green and blue light surrounding them. When the light disappeared Natasha and Stephanie took out there weapons. Cran smiled black wings sprouting from his back, black feathers falling to the ground like an omen. ""Finally a worthy challenge!"" Cran screamed in happiness. A sword appeared in his hand and black frogs appeared around him. Stephanie readied her bow and Natasha got into a stance. Even though the others weren't there it was a challenge they had to accept.

Meaghan stumbled to her feet using the wall as a support. No matter what she had to complete this task, she had to get her weapon. The tunnel was just a long winding tunnel to nothing and it had been for hours. Meaghan stumbled over another rock, except this time there was no wall to grab on to. Meaghan descended down the slope onto what felt like a pile of dirt. ""Thank god this dirt was-Ewww!"" Meaghan screamed feeling a rat or some rodent crawling over her leg. Meaghan tossed it off and shivered veil creature. Meaghan felt around on her hands and knees and came across a hard spiked substance. 'That's odd' Meaghan felt further and found a small pile of sharp objects. A bright light appeared and Meaghan was temporarily blinded holding her hands in front of her eyes. Her clothes changed to a black turtleneck, a high collared cloak was around her shoulders, and black material went down to her black sandals. A dragon's roar was heard as Meaghan disappeared.

""Heavenly,"" Adam said clutching to the plank for dear life. He had been upside down now more times then he was willing to count. ""It would be a whole lot fucking better if the plank wasn't ROTATING!"" Adam yelled almost losing his grip and falling an inch. Adam didn't dare move he was to afraid of what might happen and heaven forbid he would have to fall again. The thin pole was his only chance but he wasn't going to risk his neck so soon. 'True I'll probably fall soon' Adam thought edging closer to the pole when his fingers slipped..

Kyoi ran towards Wolfgang his dark sword raised. Wolfgang easily dodged the on slot. He was quick-to-quick his speed had increased ten fold. Kyoi turned around to look for him when he was hit in the stomach hard. He landed on the ground and skidded a few feet, blood dripping from the side of his mouth. ""You bastard"" Kyoi coughed out. Kyoi got onto his feet and looked in front of him at the arrogant Wolfgang. Kyoi smiled and gave Wolfgang the finger, ""Fuck you wolf!"" Wolfgang elbowed him in the face in a second sending Kyoi back to the ground. Wolfgang bent over Kyoi and lifted him in the air by his neck. ""Here's where you die demon, then when you're dead I can taste your woman's blood,"" Wolfgang licked his lips and tightened his hold on Kyoi's neck. ""I'll be the one to see you die."" Kyoi coughed out slowly but ended with a smile. Wolfgang tightened his grip further and heard Kyoi's muffled yell. Kyoi managed to smile and kicked Wolfgang in the crotch. Wolfgang dropped Kyoi immediately and Kyoi dropped to the ground and picked up his fallen weapon, shoving it into the wolf's chest. Wolfgang's pupils dilated when the sword went through his skin. ""Damn you demon,"" Wolfgang croaked out holding the wound. Kyoi ran to Natasha and a sword lay beside her he picked it up and smiled. The sword was thrown from his hands as he was lifted and pushed into the rock wall, ""I'm not done with you yet.""

Diar had to think he had just chosen the most unlikely person so who next, Kyoi, Rue, Stephanie, Natasha, Meaghan, Adam? He had to make a choice soon, he had a feeling something bad was happening back home. Fine which one would I not get in bed with, Kyoi, he'd hurt me. But Kyoi wouldn't hold my weapon, Rue wouldn't either he would hold Tanya's. ""I know now!"" Diar shouted pointing his finger towards Meaghan, ""my woman!"" Diar concentrated and went into Meaghan's mind. Diar entered her mind and was greeted by Tara. ""Diar!"" Tara yelled hugging him, ""what are you doing here?"" Diar smiled and returned the hug ""Do you have my weapon somewhere in here?"" Tara looked confused then smiled ""yeah I think I saw it, the really long one with the markings right? It's in the far door with no markings."" Diar nodded and walked down the hall opening the door with his right hand he walked into the darkness strangely.

Shadow waited for Rue's attack to come. Rue getting a bit impatient attacked, the wind picking up around him. Shadow ducked the last minute tossing Rue over his back and onto the cold floor. ""Any last words boy?"" Shadow asked pressing his blade to Rue's neck. ""Go to hell!"" Rue yelled swiping his leg up hitting Shadow in the kidney, Shadows blade grazed Rue's skin causing a thin line of blood to run down. Shadow was back up in an instant and both were even hit for hit. Rue ducted as Shadows blade went over his head, knocking his blade out of his hand. ""Damn it!"" Rue stepped back then looked back at Shadow who now held both swords. ""Fine then!"" Rue dodged Shadows sword assault and kicked him hard across the face the spikes on his boots cutting into Shadows face. ""Burn in hell Shadow,"" Rue said softly putting his boot into the crook of Shadow's neck. Shadow swiftly shoved one of the blades into the side of Rue's leg making him remove his leg and fall to the ground. ""You will be the one to burn!"" Shadow said standing and lifting his sword over his head and lowing it for the final blow. Rue hit his hands on the floor and lifted his legs in front of him then arched and hit the sword out of Shadows hand catching his and decapitating Shadow. The sword he was holding transformed into the familiar one he wielded years ago. A light green light appeared around him and his white clothes appeared. The high necked no sleeve shirt, with the long cape over it. The loose pants appeared in place of his shorts. He was draped with his familiar chains and gloves. He firmly held his sword and then he disappeared.

The image changed as Rue's eyes changed to a deadly crimson colour. There was a field of pure green, long grass. There will two children playing by a large stream, with crystal blue water. Tanya sat by the pool of water and smiled, the image on the face of the water zoomed towards the children so she finally got a good look at them. The male looked older and had short spiked blonde hair his eyes were hazel and he had pale skin. He wore white clothing like Rue but had belts on his pants and arms with many chains. The smaller female had long blonde hair with deep green eyes her skin was more tanned. She wore a black t-shirt with black pants. She was smiling at the boy in front of her and looked ready for something. The boy turned his head towards a large crater in the earth and a male appeared when he looked up Tanya gasped it was Rue. The little girl smiled and ran towards him and hugged him only reaching his legs. The boy just walked slowly towards him and smiled. ""Is this my future family?"" Tanya asked reaching into the water. Tanya pulled back when she felt something heavy. She put her hands back in and pulled out a very long sword. ""Figures it was that easy and I watched the whole thing,"" Tanya pouted looking at the long blade. A red light encircled her as Her clothing changed to a red top with a cloak with markings on the side. Her pants turned to loose light ones and brown boots appeared that went up to below her knees. She took one last look at the smiling children when she disappeared.

Suko walked towards them her hands getting darker as her aura raged in wild arches. ""Milady."" The male demon stepped forward grabbing the woman's hand softly. ""Vison how dare you."" Suko slapped the demon across the face making Vison's face a bit darker. ""Milady, control yourself"" Vison straightened the other demon stayed quiet behind him. ""You shouldn't tell me what to do Vison,"" Suko pulled her arm loose of Vison's touch and sat back on the edge of the bed. ""Milady, Shadow wishes to see you,"" the female demon said softly. ""Jinza, tell him I will be there in a minute,"" The two servants bowed and left the room quietly. ""It's been awhile since I have lost control, is this man the source of my power?"" Suko asked taking one last look at Rue then whipping the mirror clean, she left the room.

A few more faint lights appeared as Cran cocked an eyebrow. This battle might be more enjoyable then he thought. Tanya straightened along with, Rue, and Meaghan. Rue immediately looked at Cran and clutched his sword. More frogs were appearing ever minute. ""Fight me!"" Cran yelled raising his arms into the arm. Rue looked towards the girls and frowned, ""your first fight like this."" The girls nodded and readied their weapons. ""I'll go after the guy named Cran,"" Rue said turning to face Cran, ""you girls go after the frogs, and Stephanie you stay back here and use your bow as a defense to anyone who is going to get hurt."" Rue lowered himself and ran towards Cran his sword ready to strike. Stephanie raised her bow in the air and shot the first dagger right into the eye of one of the frogs. ""Let this battle begin!"" Stephanie shouted loading her bow again. Natasha, Meaghan, and Tanya took off in different directions, there first time using their weapons. 

Chapter 17: Diminishing Vortex, Crans Defeat
Naturally Adam freaked out looking frantically for anything to grab. The pole met his fingers and he grabbed it with a death grip. Slowly sliding down the pole inch by slow inch. 'I want to see ground again sweet, sweet ground.' Adam let his hands off the pole a little bit more and slipped faster towards the ground. When his feet touched the ground he kneeled to the ground and kissed it. ""I love you!"" Adam said still having one hand on the pole. The pole started to vibrate and Adam feared the worst. ""Oh god not again,"" Adam whispered softly. The pole turned into a rather large sword with spikes and Adam sighed as yellow light encircled him. White clothes covered his body and spiked metal boots appeared on his feet. A long white and black cape was fastened to his shirt.

Diar was a little taken aback by the appearance of the room. It was more like an extension of the hallway. It was really large maybe not even a hallway. Tara appeared behind him and started to push him down the hallway. ""No time to gawk Diar!"" Tara yelled pushing him even harder. ""Hey I was just looking!"" Diar yelled back trying to stop himself on the smooth floor. ""Your friends are fighting a battle on Earth and your staring at a giant hallway, now do you think you should hurry!"" Tara yelled back pushing him even harder when he tried to stop her. ""What why didn't you tell me before!?"" Diar asked turning around and grabbing her hand. ""Well you weren't listening,"" Tara replied with a bit of a blush. ""Come on then!"" Diar shouted still holding her hand and running down the hallway at top speeds, literally making her fly behind him. ""Diar you missed the door!"" Tara tried to shriek over the blurring images. ""What?"" Diar stopped and jogged back to a gray large door and opened it revealing his weapon in a glass box. ""Nice!"" Diar smiled and patted the glass. ""How do you get it out without a key?"" Tara asked looking at the huge weapon. ""Like this!"" Diar shouted kicking the glass. Tara watched as the glass shattered to the floor and the weapon fell right into Diar's hands. A white zipped turtleneck appeared and a long cloak with markings on his upper half. On his lower half baggy white pants and metal boots appeared. Diar waved goodbye to Tara as he disappeared in a white light.

Kyoi struggled against Wolfgang's hands. Wolfgang was bleeding heavily but he was still as fast as ever. He had almost made it but Wolfgang had still been able to knock his blade out of his hand. ""How?"" Kyoi croaked out loosing strength in his arms. ""I'm a wolf after all,"" Wolfgang smirked holding Kyoi's neck tighter watching the blood run down. ""It'll be nice to feast on your blood,"" Wolfgang continued his talking with an evil smirk. Kyoi eyed his weapon, which was about eight meters away from Wolfgang's side. But how was he going to get out of Wolfgang's grip and run to his weapon in time. Kyoi eyed Natasha's chains and rested his one hand on it making it look like he was using it for support. ""Giving up demon?"" Wolfgang asked leaning closer. Kyoi quickly gripped the chain tighter and lifted himself higher kicking Wolfgang in the stomach. He jumped out of Wolfgang's grip and ran for his life towards his weapon. Kyoi did a roll feeling fingers on his legs a second before. A dark light encircled Kyoi and a white cloak, baggy pants, tight shirt, which were all white and dark black boots that were easy to move in. ""Bye fucker!"" Kyoi growled out before disappearing.

Rue thrust his blade towards Cran but Cran easily blocked it. ""If you're going to fight me, fight me with everything you have!"" Cran said with a smile. Rue looked at Cran and glared the bastard was fighting with a hand behind his back, 'this will be difficult.' Rue smiled and continued his assault lashing out with all his strength at Cran. ""You won't be a challenge,"" Cran said simply kicking Rue in the stomach and forcing him back a few feet. 'How did he get so strong?' Cran smiled down at him, ""this is my true strength."" Rue looked back up at Cran a thin line of blood streamed down his mouth. Rue looked down and coughed up blood. Cran looked up and almost got a blade connecting to his face. Kyoi smiled as he pushed harder on Cran's blade. ""You blocked me."" Kyoi mumbled smiling wider. Rue stood up and wobbled a bit before regaining balance. ""This is my fight now Rue!"" Kyoi said briefly breaking eye contact with Cran. Rue nodded and rushed off to kill some frogs. ""I won't go so easy on you!"" Kyoi growled breaking the lock and aggressively attacking Cran.

Adam and Diar had already joined the girl's attacks. Rue smiled and attacked beside Diar making the killing go faster. ""The frogs seem to be multiplying,"" Adam said looking over at the moving bunch of frogs. ""Cran's probably the source, if he dies the frogs duplicating will stop!"" Rue yelled back making sure Kyoi could hear. Kyoi gave a quick smirk and attacked Cran again this time using most of his strength. Rue smiled and sliced open one of the frogs ahead of him. The frog's blood and guts spreading on the dry earth.

Tanya was having a hard time and the other's seemed to be having a hard time too. There was a lot of blood on the hilt of the sword making it slippery and hard to use, there was also a lot of blood on the blade. Natasha was right beside her seeing that Tanya was having a much harder time then her. They fought together as a team each striking one after the other. ""This would be easier if I knew how to hold a blade this big,"" Tanya said swinging it again cutting off the frog's front leg. ""Yes, it would,"" Natasha, replied swinging her sword and getting better results. The guys on the other side seemed to be having an easier time.

Diar smiled as he slashed his sword through numerous frogs. ""Why doesn't one of us help the girls?"" Adam asked in a slight pant. A frog's tongue lashed out and cut the side of his face leaving a small pain that erupted into a searing heat. ""Argh!"" Adam yelled falling to the ground clutching his face. ""Adam!"" Diar ran over to him and put up a shield, ""what's wrong?"" Adam looked up through pained eyes, ""the frogs tongues are poisonous."" Rue looked over at the shield and growled low at the frogs, ""You will pay!"" Rue lifted his sword to the side and it caught the suns light blinding the eyes of a few frogs. The wind around everyone changed and shifted gathering around Rue's raised sword. Rue narrowed hid eyes and the wind wrapped around the sword, Rue raised it higher and slammed it to the ground. The frogs that were attacking all went ridged and split apart, blood, guts, and scaled skin fell to the ground. Some of the group was pushed back by the strength. Kyoi raised an eyebrow as he was pushed away from Cran yet he remained on his feet. Crans attention traveled to Rue in amazement, which gave Kyoi a perfect chance to attack.

Kyoi smiled as the hilt of his blade knocked him in the side of the face causing Cran to soar through the air and land on the pavement. Kyoi used his free hand to energize some power and forced it to his hand. Crans eyes opened wide and a dagger from somewhere came up as he cut the side of Kyoi's chest the closest available target. Kyoi flinched back he had not expected the attack and had lost the energy in his hand. The attack hadn't reached skin but he had cut a large portion of his shirt. With just one simple attack of a dagger half of his clothes were hanging off his arm. ""Crappy cloth,"" Kyoi whispered ripping the shirt off exposing his highly built chest. ""Are you trying to intimidate me?"" Cran asked getting up off the ground. ""No, I'm going to beat your ass without as much effort,"" Kyoi smirked running a hand through his hair. Cran made his wings appear and he flew into the air with a smirk. A herd more of frogs appeared on either side of Kyoi some going for the girls others going for Rue since Adam couldn't fight and Diar was protecting him. Kyoi made his wings appear, dark black feathers falling to the ground.

""Not more of them!"" Tanya yelled out getting off the ground but still tired. Her body wasn't put up for this quite yet. Natasha stood up as well and gripped her sword tightly. ""Let's try something out,"" Meaghan said limping over. Meaghan had the hardest time fighting since she had to fight really close range. ""What?"" Natasha asked blocking the frogs tongue. ""Lets try combining our power."" Meaghan said softly putting out her hand. Tanya and Natasha nodded and put one of their hands on top of Meaghans. The mixture of energies collided and went into one power. The mixture of gray, red, and dark green went into one massive ball of power. All three of them glared at the approaching frogs. Stephanie had been able to keep most of them at bay. All three of them raised their hands in unison feeling each other's movements. The ball was thrown with great force to the frogs. It expanded as it traveled and the ground started to quake beneath everyone's feet. Stone spikes emerged from the ground along with some of the earth crumbling and forming around the frogs crushing their bodies. There was also a fire that passed that burned everything to a small dust. All three of the girls fell to the ground, not a frog was in sight just a thin surface of sand and dust.

Rue felt the disturbance and felt the earth protest at the enormous power. He looked over at the girls and saw the ball of power fly towards the frogs and watched as their bodies were crushed and burned to nothing. ""My turn!"" Rue's eyes narrowed as he searched deep down for the core of his power. He trusted in Kyoi to defeat Cran soon or the group would be dead. Rue reached within and found the power he wanted bringing it towards his hands and down towards his sword he lifted the blade close to his face and mumbled a few words. He turned the sword so the hilt was now near his head and forcefully drove the blade into the earth. The wind ripped around the sword as Rue fell to the ground panting. The gusts increased until a tornado of huge proportion made it's way towards the frogs, which were easily ripped apart. Rue relaxed his grip on the sword and the tornado impeded. Rue looked up in to the sky warily and saw Kyoi nod his head.

Kyoi looked back from his nod and looked fully at Cran. ""You're breathing your final breaths!"" Kyoi said happily twisting around and kicking Cran across the head. Cran massaged his face and looked at Kyoi who looked calm. ""Unlike Rue, I won't go easy on you!"" Kyoi crossed both his arms over his chest in an X shape and darkness appeared around it making everything behind it dark. Cran was a little terrified he had only seen one thing as dark as that before, and it was darkness even greater then Shadows. The darkness of the one room he had entered by accident while walking in Shadows castle. A man in the gloom of the darkness chained to the wall with crimson eyes and hair darker then midnight. Cran closed his eyes and put down his guard. ""Kill me now, for I am only the first challenge,"" Cran mumbled as Kyoi's hands flew forward and made contact with Cran's body.

Cran's body fell to the ground and his hair shortened to a spiked look. His eyes changed to a brown and the power inside of him hummed not to the darkness but to light. Kyoi looked down and flew towards Natasha to see if she was all right. ""You alright?"" Kyoi asked as his feet touched the ground and he crossed his arms over his chest. ""Fine, just tired,"" Natasha replied stumbling to her feet. Natasha looked around at the group, no one looked terribly hurt accept for Adam who was turning paler quickly. Meaghan limped over to Stephanie who was sitting on the ground with a half smile. She was happy because the battle was finally over with Cran but was sad because Adam had been wounded greatly. Stephanie got up but was forced down by Meaghan, ""rest, Diar and Rue will take care of him."" Stephanie nodded and looked over to Adam who was twitching.

Rue looked over his shoulder at Adam. ""What kind of poison is it?"" Rue asked leaning beside Adam. ""I don't know but its strong and taking effect quickly,"" Diar replied softly. ""Can you fix it?"" Kyoi called from a distance, it was still amazing how great his hearing was. ""I don't know it looks bad, we might have to take him to a hospital!"" Diar called back with a worried expression. ""Can you do something Diar with your power?"" Rue asked changing his view to Diar. ""I might be able to but I would completely waste myself,"" Diar replied but already started to generate energy from deep down into Adam's body. Adam's colour slowly came back but his breathing was still laboured. ""That's the best I could do,"" Diar panted out falling back but Rue caught him. ""It gives us more time, now we might be able to get him to a hospital,"" Rue smiled picking up Adam and helping Diar stand.

Tanya looked over her shoulder at Diar and Adam and slowly made her way towards Cran. ""We have to take him to!"" Tanya managed to yell out over a dry throat. ""Why? Let him die!"" Kyoi looked over at Tanya with a weird expression. ""He was only possessed, he's a good person!"" Tanya called back lifting him up slightly blood spreading on her shirt. ""Let her take him!"" Rue yelled to Kyoi. Kyoi growled and grabbed Natasha, Stephanie grabbed Meaghan, Tanya grabbed Cran, and Rue grabbed Adam and Diar. ""Can you handle both of them old man!"" Kyoi laughed looking back as he took off in the sky. ""I think I can manage!"" Rue laughed with Kyoi. They all took off towards the hospital where all of them would probably be treated.

Suko looked over at Shadow as she entered the giant black hall. ""Cran has been defeated. What do you want with me?"" Suko asked putting on her stoic mask. ""I know about the humans defeat."" Shadow smiled and stood up the doors of the hall opening. Suko looked behind her and noticed four people walking into the room bathed in a dark light. 

Chapter 18: The Four
Suko looked behind her as the doors opened. The first figure to step into the light made by the gigantic windows was a man with long blue, hair. He had red eyes, and had a scar on his right arm. He wore nothing over his chest and only a thin layer of cloth as shorts. He had a tail that swung around him freely. ""Milady,"" the blue haired man bowed his head and stopped in front of her momentarily. ""Wolfgang,"" Suko smiled looking up at him. Wolfgang stood a good five inches over Suko and smiled at her. ""Why are you here Wolfgang?"" Suko asked tilting her head. ""I was asked to come milady,"" Wolfgang smiled and turned towards a woman that stopped beside him.

The woman that stopped beside Wolfgang had long deep purple hair, and a very pale complexion that seemed to glow like the moon. Her deep purple eyes were like voids of darkness. She wore hardly anything, just a purple thick body suit that showed a lot of skin, made of some material unknown to Suko. ""Wolfgang come on,"" the woman whispered in a soft voice. ""Baitasha, this is milady Suko, Shadows mistress,"" Wolfgang smiled holding Suko's hands. ""His mistress?"" Baitasha questioned looking her over. ""Nice to meet you milady,"" she whispered walking away swiftly. Wolfgang rolled his eyes and followed her.

The servant Vison was the next to enter the room his servant clothes thin and made of a poor quality of silk. The silk was black with a great red dragon and demon fighting down the material. Vison had long, black spiked hair, his eyes were a deep blue and his skin was dark especially on one side of his face. ""Milady,"" Vison bowed his head while walking. ""Vison,"" Suko said softly raising her head in a show of dominance. Suko walked after them and sat down beside Shadow as a lesser servant ran in the great hall panting. His hair was a deep crimson colour that went down to his shoulders. His eyes were pitch black and his skin was white. He wore the clothing of a servant of lesser status then Vison. ""Milord!"" the demon yelled bowing his head and panting. ""Shinzomaru, continue,"" Shadow rose from his seat looking down on the demon. ""Ten servants were killed milord, we tried to do as you wished us too but we all died except me. I came to inform you milord,"" Shinzomaru spoke loudly his voice projecting over the hall. ""So even in his own filth, he can still kill with ease, bring him in Shinzomaru,"" Shadow called down to the demon. ""Milord."" Shinzomaru backed away trembling. Shadow sat back down and sighed this might take awhile.

Rue and Kyoi landed first and shakily made there way into the hospital, Tanya and Stephanie followed shortly. A person at the front desk didn't even look up and just pointed her hand to the seats. ""Um. we kind of have an emergency,"" Tanya said walking to the front desk. ""I'll be the judge of that!"" the lady stood up and caught her first glance at the bloody group. The papers tumbled out of her hands as she reached for the phone and dialed a number. In about five minutes nurses had arrived with nine stretchers. The nurses lowered them all into stretchers and ran them down the hall to separate rooms.

""Oh, dear what is your name?"" A nurse with blonde hair in a bun asked. ""Tanya,"" Tanya replied smiling and yawning. ""You're suffering from heavy exhaustion and many small wounds. It just seemed worse since you had more blood on your hands."" The nurse smiled, ""oh, you can call me Betty."" Tanya smiled and closed her eyes.

'Have you ever believed in the power of a persons blood, how it leaves its print? Have your hands been drenched in a creature's blood? Have you felt an enemy's blood course through your veins? Have you broken the unwritten law of death? Has your mind been swamped with the feel of blood? Or has it rotted in it's own grave.'

Natasha lay there in the pure white room looking at the ceiling. It hurt and the exhaustion was almost too much but she could take it. ""You alright?"" Kyoi asked in his chair beside her bed. ""What about you?"" Natasha asked her eyes leaving the ceiling and meeting the red ones. ""I've already been cleaned and bandaged, but I can tell you're exhausted. Go to sleep."" Kyoi smiled leaning back in the chair. Natasha nodded and closed her eyes almost instantly falling asleep. Kyoi smiled and closed his eyes as well.

Rue smiled at his exhaustion. He was getting soft. 'I use to be able to defeat a person like they were butter. Feels like I'm in a cage.' A nurse walked in and smiled looking at the man lying in the hospital bed. 'Oh man he's good looking, perfect body.' Rue looked over at the brunette and cocked an eyebrow. ""Hello, my name's Jenn I'll be your nurse!"" Rue sat up in the bed causing the blanket to fall from his shoulders showing his well- defined chest. The nurse Jenn blushed and looked towards the floor. ""What are my symptoms?"" Rue asked looking at her reddening face. ""Ah.ah! You're suffering from total exhaustion and bruised ribs."" Jenn squeaked looking into Rue's eyes. ""Thank you, and my name is Rue,"" he said lying back down. Jenn smiled and backed out of the room letting him sleep.

Diar wasn't at nice to the nurses since he was only suffering mild exhaustion and a few cuts and bruises. ""Give me beer! I'm not going to heal without it!"" Diar yelled flailing his arms. ""Sir this is a hospital no alcohol allowed."" The nurse bugged him to be quiet. ""I want my beer!"" Diar yelled as it echoed down the hall. ""Sir will you please settle down, you need rest,"" the nurse urged. Diar stared at her for a minute then blinked, ""fine. I sleep but by the time I wake up I want a beer!""

Stephanie sighed as she sat down beside Adam. She was the only one that hadn't been wounded in the fight, only one scratch from her bows backlash. Adam on the other hand was twitching in an uncomfortable sleep. Stephanie reached out for his hand and stroked it softly. ""Um, excuse me my name is Ben and I'll be Adam's nurse,"" the man with black hair at the rooms entrance said. Stephanie stifled a laugh at seeing a male nurse. ""Um, hi my name's Stephanie,"" she smiled softly. ""Your friend has a serious poison in his body, we might not be able to help him,"" Ben said in little more then a whisper. Stephanie let go of Adam's hand and ran up to Ben. ""You have to help him, I don't want him to die!"" Stephanie yelled a tear falling from her face. ""The doctors and I will do all we can,"" Ben said hugging the girl to comfort her.

Meaghan was in and out of consciousness; her wounds ached every time she turned in her sleep. Stephanie came into the room silently as Ben and the doctor had moved Adam to a different room, preparing to remove the poison. Stephanie watched as Meaghan turned over in her sleep and twitched slightly. ""And this isn't even the beginning,"" Stephanie mumbled looking around at all the charts in the room.

One of the nurses with red hair stood over Cran making notes her nametag read Sellie. ""Wow, what could have made a wound like that,"" Sellie said while looking over at the man's head. ""Sellie, this young man has been identified,"" another nurse walked into the room holding some papers. ""His parents have been called, it seems he was a missing teenager,"" the nurse gave Sellie the papers and walked out of the room. Sellie sighed and sent in a male nurse to clean Cran up.

Wolfgang sighed and started pacing the hall. Vison had found a very comfortable pillar to lean on and Baitasha looked out of one of the huge windows her eyes reflecting the sun. Shadow was getting impatient maybe Shinzomaru died. After another fifteen minutes a figure was bathed in light holding a chain covered in blood. Drops of blood fell to the floor as Shinzomaru walked into the hall shakily. Connected on the other end of the chain appeared to be a man black dirty hair hung to his face in wet locks. His hair covered his eyes but blood was dripping from his face. His wrists were bruised and bloodied along with his ankles. His skin was pale and scars covered his arms, legs and chest. His ripped thin, pants were wet and dirty, and he smelt like he hadn't washed in years. ""Finally Shinzomaru,"" Shadow stood up from his chair and looked down at the new arrival. Wolfgang stopped pacing and glanced at the man his sensitive nose caused him to lift his hand over his face.

Suko was shocked but didn't show it. The man looked up slightly crimson eyes showed through his damp locks of black hair. ""Sifril the slayer, it's nice of you to join us after killing many of my men,"" Shadow said smiling. ""It seems that you might remember this face, my mistress Suko,"" Shadow motioned to Suko. Sifril lifted his gaze to the woman Shadow had motioned to and narrowed his eyes. ""Valor,"" Suko said softly. Sifril growled out and looked back towards the floor. ""He is no longer called that Suko,"" Shadow said walking closing to Sifril. ""You certainly have changed, your more primitive then ever, more beast and your older then I am, you were once known as Vali as a youngster,"" Shadow laughed, ""Vali the handsome!""

~A week later~

""So were finally out of that dump!"" Diar smiled stretching. Adam walked out last with pills in his hand. ""I have to take pills to completely destroy the poison,"" Adam sighed putting the pills in his pocket. ""Well at least your not dead,"" Diar joked getting out his new bottle of beer. ""No matter what that kid goes through he always goes back to the beer,"" Rue laughed from a bus bench. ""There's one thing I want to do before we leave, you guys suggest what were going to do, I'll be right back,"" Tanya waved and ran back into the hospital.

Tanya ran to the room Cran was supposed to be located in and looked in. His parents, sister and brother seemed to be there. His mom was praying by his side, his brother and father were asking the doctor and nurses questions, and his sister was crying. ""Excuse me,"" Tanya said and walked into the room. Cran's mother looked up with a tear stained face waiting for the new arrival to say something. ""How is he doing?"" Tanya asked stepping towards Cran's bed. ""He'll be here awhile,"" One of the nurses, said taking Cran's pulse. ""I think he'll be out of here before you know it,"" Tanya smiled holding Cran's hand. ""Do you know my son?"" The mother asked between weeps. ""Yes, sort of, I was the one who brought him here,"" Tanya replied looking at the good Cran. ""Where was he?"" his mother asked pleadingly. ""Miss this may be hard for you to understand, your son was possessed, it was the only way."" Tanya trailed of a tear rolling down her face. ""What happened to my son?"" The woman grabbed Tanya's hands pleadingly. ""He fought against me and my friends with a bunch of demon frogs, we had to wound him to make him return to his usual self,"" Tanya said even if she sounded insane. ""I believe you,"" the woman whispered, ""thank you for bringing him here."" Tanya nodded and left the room after saying goodbye.

""Okay we've decided,"" Natasha said noticing Tanya walking out of the hospital. ""What's going on?"" Tanya asked no one in particular. ""Rue and Stephanie went out to buy some clothes and other materials we might need, then were going to split into groups of two and train in the wilderness,"" Natasha replied. ""Sounds good. What are the groups?"" Tanya smiled knowing the answer. ""Kyoi and me, Rue and you, Meaghan and Diar, and Stephanie and Adam,"" Natasha smiled. ""Good,"" Tanya sat down on the bench beside Natasha.

""Now, I already have confronted you about the Kurai,"" Shadow said on the top of his floating castle. ""Each of you will take a pair of the Kurai to attack and kill, you can kill everyone except the blonde girl Niaka, they will call her Tanya,"" Shadow continued. ""Suko has used here psychic ability to find out the Kurai's plans, they will train in different areas of the world. Baitasha you are assigned to the Canadian Rocky Mountains, to a pair called Meaghan and Diar. Wolfgang you are assigned to the great woods of Canada, to a pair called Natasha and Kyoi. Vison you are assigned to Vancouver Island near the coast, to a pair called Adam and Stephanie. And finally Sifril you have a very important job, you are assigned to Rue's plain in Canada, to Rue and Tanya. If you do anything to the girl you will be killed."" Shadow walked down the line of warriors. ""Now you are dismissed kill everyone, except Tanya, don't even harm her Sifril."" Shadow walked away from the ledge of his home. Baitasha pulled out her staff and bowed jumping off the ledge, purple transparent wings sprouting from her back. Vison bowed low and his wings increased to five times his body size, and he took off from the ledge. Wolfgang lowered his head and jumped off the ledge falling through the sky. Sifril stood still for a minute then turned his back and leapt off the ledge chains following after him.

""Can they kill them?"" Suko asked. ""You doubt your son?"" Shadow laughed softly. ""I would never doubt him but the others,"" Suko mumbled, ""the woman, servant and wolf."" Shadow smiled, ""they are quite capable Baitasha is a mage, Vison is the last of his kind an ancient race of powerful demons, and Wolfgang is a wolf indeed,"" Shadow smirked turning back inside. 'And my son is a beast that will never follow your orders,' Suko looked out at the sky and stood there till the sunset. 

Chapter 19: Through Forests, Lakes, Mountains, and Plains
Sifril took his first steps in Rue's Plain. The tall green grass
went on for miles. On the left side of the Plain there was a stream and a
forest, and deep in the distance mountains could be seen. The smell of
clean oxygen was foreign to Sifril, being caged for so long with no light
and nothing to do except gnaw at your own skin to escape. Being chained
to a wall, and having to sleep in your own, filth, urine, and the
multiple bugs that crawled on your skin. Sifril looked towards the stream
and stripped himself of his wet rags. He slowly wandered into the water
savouring the feeling of the water of his skin. The chains grated against
the sandy bottom as he lowered his head under and rinsed it out the best
he could. He brought his head out of the water, the quarter moon rising
in the distance. Little droplets fell from his clean hair. Droplets also
flowed from his face and chest. He loved this moment; the bloodied skin
of his wrists and ankles throbbed painfully, but he didn't care. 'My last
obstacle are these chains and then I am free once more.'

Baitasha landed almost silently on the edge of a mountain. It would
be awhile till her prey arrived. Baitasha took a look at her
surroundings. There were mountains far and wide and a forest along the
border of mountains. ""Well by this landscape it should be easy to hide
and spy."" Baitasha flew around the mountain looking for a place to rest
she found a small area of out hanging rocks. Baitasha looked underneath
and saw a family of cougars. She lay down beside them and closed her
eyes, not afraid of the cougars at all that were rising from her smell.
Animals never did touch her.

Wolfgang landed on a tree branch, he smiled as a loud crack was heard
the branch breaking in two. He flipped off the tree and glared at it.
""They won't be here for awhile so what can I do for fun?"" Wolfgang asked
himself sitting down on the ground his tail playing beside him. ""I could
eat,"" Wolfgang bit the bottom of his lip making a bit of blood swell. He
licked his lip and walked through the forest his ears and eyes alert as
his nose sniffed the area. He stopped unexpected and turned his eyes to
the right, his pupils narrowed as he say his prey drinking from the
river. Wolfgang's claws extended as he carefully made his way towards the
moose. In an instant he was beside the moose his teeth digging into the
animals neck. The moose kicked violently and tried to get away. Wolfgang
quickly shoved his claws into the animal's side watching it slowly stop
its struggle and fall dead by his feet. ""Easy kill!"" Wolfgang smiled and
sat down beside the dead moose biting into the dead moose's neck and
relishing the taste.

Vison landed by the shore his wings shrinking to their smaller size.
He sat down on a particularly large boulder and let the wind flow through
his black hair. ""I wonder why Shadow chose me for this mission,"" Vison
said to himself. ""He said something about me having great power when we
were alone, but if I have great power why am I a servant?"" Vison shook
his head and watched a small child run down the beach with her beagle
running behind her. ""Humans, they allude me, with their strange behavior
and emotions,"" Vison shifted his head as the beagle ran towards him and
barked a few times sniffing his left leg. ""It seems Felix likes you,"" the
little girl smiled shyly. ""It seems so,"" Vison forced himself to smile,
another alluding human. ""Sarah what have I told you about strangers!"" A
woman in light blue yelled while running to the little girl. ""But mommy,""
The little girl Sarah started. ""No, buts Sarah what if he was a rapist,
or would have abducted you,"" The mother said pulling Sarah away, Felix
reluctantly following. Vison smirked me a rapist, Wolfgang's the rapist,
I don't know about the Sifril guy but something about him I don't like.
He has too much power, even more then Shadow.

""They've been gone for over three hours, clothes shopping isn't that
hard!"" Tanya yelled getting off of the bench, ""I even got an ass cramp!""
Natasha smirked and folded her arms over her chest. ""Where did the others
go anyway?"" Tanya asked started to pace. ""Well, Stephanie and Rue are
getting the clothes. Diar went with Meaghan to get food and beer. Adam I
don't know where the hell Adam went and Kyoi just kind of left after
everyone else."" Natasha replied. ""Well that's just great!"" Tanya said
walking into something hard and falling back before her wrists were
caught. ""What's just great?"" Rue asked, Stephanie holding all the bags.
""You and your attitude, you, you dead corpse rapist!"" Tanya yelled
pulling her hands out of his grip and pacing again. ""Dead corpse rapist?""
Rue asked looking from Natasha to Stephanie who was laughing silently.
""You enjoy the pleasure of dead corpse sex,"" Natasha said laughing. ""Umm,
I've never even heard of dead corpse sex in my life,"" Rue said shifting
his eyes. ""You want a description?"" Stephanie asked smiling, ""Just ask
the ruler of corpse sex!""

Stephanie turned to Tanya as Kyoi, Adam, Meaghan, and Diar returned.
""What do you want me too describe. there is nothing to describe about it
the name says it all."" Tanya said softly. ""What's going on?"" Diar asked
happily. Kyoi smiled ""I bet Diar would enjoy dead corpse sex."" Diar
looked at him with a grin ""hey Kyoi you kinda look like a corpse wanna
go?"" Kyoi slowly turned to look at Diar, ""What.?"" Diar smiled and inched
towards Kyoi, ""you know you want me!"" Kyoi's eyes widened as he ran away
from Diar as Diar unbuttoned his shirt.

""Yo guys are we leaving this century or do we have to witness dead
corpse sex! In my opinion I want to keep my virgin eyes!"" Tanya yelled
from where she was on the bench. ""Hey, you're the one who came up with
it! So don't call dare call yourself innocent!"" Diar yelled back
buttoning up his shirt. Kyoi looked relieved as he ran his hand through
his hair. ""I wasn't going to call myself innocent, my thoughts are to bad
for that word to exist, the only thing I said was that I was a virgin!""
Tanya yelled back. Rue smirked, ""penny for your thoughts."" Tanya looked
up at him, ""wouldn't you like to know."" Natasha sighed, ""Can we go now?
We have everything right?"" Diar nodded, ""yeah we can all go, each person
take your two bags and leave for your locations."" Everyone smiled and got
up to get their bags. ""Bye everyone see you in a year, if anything
happens call, mentally I guess,"" Tanya waved to her friends and gave a
final hug to Natasha. ""Bye,"" everyone waved and disappeared like nothing
had ever happened there.

Sifril soaked his wet garments in the water and let them rest there
for awhile. He finally decided to get out of the water after much
reluctance. He put his wet pants on and turned his head quickly, they
were coming. Sifril smiled his canine teeth poking into his lower lip.
Sifril sped off in the direction towards the mountains, trees and
woodland creatures blurred by. 'So they have finally arrived, let's see
what's so interesting about this bitch.' Sifril smiled sitting down in a
cave that had been made by some animal in the side of the mountain.
'Shadow is only human and so is this bitch, women, I once loved one but
she left me, she was the only one who accepted me for what I am. In
reality I told her to leave me, if she hadn't she would have been killed
there, but she could have come back to me! Unless she.'

Baitasha awoke with a start, the cougars had left and a power was
approaching. 'So finally they decide to come, took them long enough.'
Baitasha put a barrier around the den allowing non-magic creatures to
enter. Baitasha stretched her arms over her head and yawned, ""I haven't
slept like that in awhile, ever since Shadow has haunted my dreams,""
Biatasha smiled and laid back down closing her eyes and feeling the
movement of two powers approaching.

Wolfgang raised his head slowly from his prey, blood dripping off
his chin. ""Finally, I was almost done, then what would I have done?""
Wolfgang asked shoving the moose into the water. The water slowly turned
red and spread through the pond. ""My mark has been made,"" Wolfgang smiled
running off into the woods as he felt the hum of power underneath his feet. Wolfgang jumped into the air into the highest tree in the woods. He
slid his claws into the bark and moved downwards. ""This forest will know
my presence, let's see if my prey will find it as well.""

Vison looked up into the sky as he felt the surge of power one made
of water the other of lightning. 'If those two worked together they would
be one hell of a challenge.' Vison jumped off his perch and looked at his
surroundings. A small island with a lot of rocks was to his right quite
far from shore. ""I guess that's my hide out."" Vison said floating over
the water and landing on a ragged rock. He found a particularly covered
spot and laid down in it. Waiting silently for the two humans to come.

It started to rain in British Columbia, a violent lightning storm
that only lasted five minutes. It ended at a beach the sun appearing
again. It could have been called a strange weather phenomenon. Adam
stretched his arms over his head and watched Stephanie appear. Stephanie
tossed her bag near the big boulder and smiled. ""Well Adam, what do you
want to do? I don't think we should train the first day."" Adam shrugged,
""Why don't we rest, I'm still not entirely over the poison yet so my body
is kinda weak."" Adam admitted fisting the pills in his pocket. ""Okay I
guess that's a good idea, I'm a little tired myself."" Stephanie got her
bag and folded out a sleeping bag walking over to a less sandy area, Adam
close behind her. Not noticing the golden eyes watching them.

The tree branch beneath Wolfgang's feet started to shake as he saw
to figures appear in a clearing in front of him. The first was a female
that appeared from the ground. The second, a male that appeared out of
nowhere. Wolfgang smirked if that was his competition this battle was as
good as won. Kyoi threw his bag to the corner of the clearing walking
swiftly up to Natasha. Natasha looked up at him as Kyoi grabbed the bag
out of her hand and threw it in the same corner. ""I've been waiting so
long for us to be alone,"" Kyoi whispered into her ear. His hands made
there way down to her hips as he pulled up her shirt slightly. His mouth
making it's way on her jaw line. Kyoi moved his way to her lips hovering
over them by millimeters. He looked into her eyes and when she slowly
nodded he kissed her slowly at first. Then roughly demanding entrance to
her mouth. Natasha complied opening her mouth as Kyoi moved his tongue
over her teeth not a single inch over looked. Wolfgang growled from his
perch as he painfully grabbed the tree branch. It was times like these
when he wished he hadn't been in the area. He whimpered softly a small
howl escaping his throat.

Meaghan and Diar reached the Rocky Mountains Diar had been there for about ten minutes when Meaghan finally arrived. ""Next time you're coming
in my portal,"" Diar commanded. ""Make me!"" Meaghan snapped at him putting
on a jacket from her bag. ""I will then!"" Diar walked slowly towards her.
""What are you going to do?"" Meaghan asked backing away until her back met
rock. ""What men do after they have a few beers,"" Diar smirked happily.
""You know that's rape,"" Meaghan said pushing him back. ""Oh come on you
know you want it!"" Diar said happily. ""Quite the happy act and let's just
go the hell to bed."" Meaghan said getting her sleeping bag and finding a
sheltered area. ""Meaghan! I forgot to get a sleeping bag!"" Diar yelled.
""No you didn't!"" Meaghan called back already rested happily. ""No, no I'm
telling the truth,"" Diar said from beside her. ""I see it your bag you
moron!"" Meaghan yelled in his face. ""Uhh.fine then"" Diar said softly
getting out his sleeping bag and crawling in.

Rue appeared about the same time Tanya did. Tanya smiled at him and
put her sleeping bag on the ground. ""What are you doing?"" said Rue
glancing down at her. ""I'm getting ready to go to sleep. Unless you don't
want to sleep tonight,"" Tanya said a wicked smile on her face. Rue sat
down beside her waiting for her to get comfortably under her sleeping bag
when he crawled in with her. ""Actually, I still want to know what these
thoughts are,"" Rue smiled as she looked up at him. ""I could teach you but
not tonight,"" she yawned.

""You know I can't sleep without a good night kiss,"" Rue pouted
wrapping his arms around her waist. ""If one of your hands moves any
higher, you'll be dead,"" Tanya teased him rubbing her nose against his.
""What like this?"" Rue said softly. Tanya made a small squeaking noise as
she fought down the urge to slap him. That's when she noticed his hands
hadn't moved. ""You are so dead,"" Tanya said slowly. ""And what are you
going to do to me?"" Rue asked smiling and kissing her fully on the lips.
When the heated kiss ended Tanya smirked ""I'd do something like this.""
Tanya's left leg traveled up Rue's leg to his waist the other one swiftly
going straight to his crotch. Rue groaned as he doubled over in pain.
Tanya's legs not making him move far. ""Now I got you back,"" Tanya said in
triumph. ""I only touched you lightly,"" Rue groaned out. ""Ah-huh, and you
stayed there to, so it's your own fault you brought it on, unless you
want me to be gentle?"" Tanya purred out. ""I think I'll go for sleep."" Rue
said straitening up. ""Good choice,"" Tanya said yawning. 

Chapter 20: The Handsome, The Slyer, The Beast
Rue awoke from his peaceful slumber. He squinted his eyes trying to get adjusted to the light. When his eyes were adjusted the first thing he noticed was that Tanya wasn't there, which made him get up so fast he fell back down. ""Rue, I'm right here,"" Tanya sighed poking the boiling eggs with a stick. ""Well couldn't you have woken me up or something?"" Rue asked rubbing his eyes to see well. ""I could've but where's the fun in that?"" Tanya smirked flipping over the eggs with the flimsy stick. Rue sighed and got up and sat next to her. ""What kind of eggs do you want?"" inquired Tanya. ""I don't want any eggs I want you,"" Rue replied kissing her passionately. Tanya pushed more into his embrace her hands sliding up to his neck, Rue's hands pulling her closer to him.

        Tanya moved her body closer to Rue as his hands traveled downwards tugging on the bottom of her shirt. Rue started to lift her shirt and grazed her soft flesh as Tanya's eyes opened slightly and saw the eggs. ""Oh no! Damn!"" Tanya yelled crawling over to the burnt eggs. Rue just sat there blinking for a few minutes before he realized what was going on. Tanya sighed and put up her hands in defeat. ""No breakfast for us,"" Tanya said standing up and grabbing her sword that rested with her bags. ""Hey, Rue you going to train me or not?"" Tanya asked standing in front of him waiting for an answer. 'Yeah, sure,"" Rue stood up and grabbed his sword. ""Where should we train?"" Tanya asked again looking at his clueless face. ""Over there,"" Rue pointed to a huge clearing his face turning back to its regular expression.

        Rue walked over to the clearing and got into a fighting stance as he told Tanya to do the same. Rue groaned as he stood back upright, dropped his sword and walked over to Tanya. ""What? Did I do something wrong already?"" Tanya asked shakily. Sighing Rue stepped behind her and wrapped his arms around her. Tanya looked into Rues face then noticed what he was doing. His hands were on top of hers, guiding them to hold the sword in a correct manner. Tanya smiled at him as he let go of her and walked back over to his own sword. ""Okay, let's see what you got!"" Rue yelled running towards her.

        Sifril had gotten to their location earlier that morning. He had watched as the girl called Tanya had risen from her sleep, as she walked into the forest and returned with a few eggs. He had watched as she cooked the eggs, and he watched the connection between the two when the man had arisen. At that time Sifril had felt something boil deep down inside him a loathing towards anyone who touched that woman. Just something about her, the way she smiled and cursed with the purest emotion. Sifril had moved when they had walked to the clearing together. He had watched as they trained, the woman was obviously just learning how to use a sword since the man was teaching her how to hold it. They had fought for a good four hours; she had steadily improved since they started. She was quick at learning Sifril observed. By the time there training was over Tanya had walked back to came her body full of tiny cuts and bruises while the man walked away with not even a scratch.

        Sifril had gotten tired of watching and waiting. He stood up from his hiding spot as he ran through the forest. When he arrived at the now familiar cave the sound of rattling chains was his reward. He sat against the damp wall, small rays of light touching his white skin. Small droplets of water fell from the roof of the cave as Sifril closed his eyes, still alert for any sudden movements in the vicinity.

        ""Well you improved a lot since this morning,"" Rue said dipping the bloody cloth in the water. ""Yeah right, I wasn't even able to hit you,"" Tanya pouted wincing as the cloth touched her abused flesh. ""Well at least you got close, and you didn't fall by the weight of your sword,"" Rue whispered rubbing the cloth over her skin. Tanya sighed and leaned back a little against the pillow she was resting on. ""Lift up your shirt,"" Rue commanded dipping the cloth back in the water. ""What?"" Tanya asked eyeing him suspiciously. Rue groaned and lifted it up himself tracing the cloth over her stomach, which made Tanya shiver. ""Cut that out,"" Tanya gasped as she shivered again. ""Why should I? You teased me this morning,"" Rue smirked continuing his ministrations. ""I was not teasing you, I was making breakfast,"" Tanya whined trying to move away but Rue had a firm hold on her shoulder. ""Yeah that was teasing,"" Rue said leaning closer. Rue was inches from her mouth his breathing tickling Tanya's face. ""Your so cruel,"" Tanya whimpered out. Rue smiled leaning forward and kissing her. Tanya was helpless under him, her hands were held by one of Rue's hands, her legs were held to the ground by Rue's hips, and her face was caught straight by his mouth on hers. Rue's other hand was traveling down her side and then rested on her stomach where her shirt had been lifted up. ""Rue,"" Tanya said softly when Rue had stopped kissing her. Rue traveled down her jaw line kissing at every interval.

        ""Rue,"" Tanya whimpered when Rue started down towards her neck and collar. The sun was setting in the distance and they hadn't eaten a thing the whole day. Rues hair was illuminated a light orange his skin giving off a heavenly glow. ""Rue it's getting late. and I'm hungry"" Tanya moaned, Rue's hands leaving her hands and resting on her hips. ""There's nothing to eat, and I'm savoring you."" Rue smiled going back down to her lips until Tanya turned her head away. ""I'm hungry and you're not letting me have any fun,"" Tanya whispered into his ear. Rue sighed and rolled off of her standing up and walking over to the bag that contained food. ""Thanks,"" Tanya said sitting up and winching. The wounds had been utterly painless when Rue had been there. ""Here,"" Rue said throwing a few grain bars at her and carrying back two sodas. ""Yes Coke!"" Tanya said grabbing her Coke from Rue. Rue sighed and sat down besides her drinking his Coke. Tanya ate her bars in silence drinking her Coke in between bites. Rue watched as the moon rose in the sky millions of stars visible in the sky. Tanya yawned and leaned back against her pillow, her pop now finished. ""Your tired you should get some sleep, it will be another long day tomorrow,"" Rue said placing his hand over her eyelids. Tanya yawned one last time turned and fell asleep. Rue put a blanket over her and lay down beside her.

        Rue woke up in the morning and yawned. He had the best dream last night. Rue blinked a few times noticing something was missing. He looked beside him and noticed Tanya was missing a small piece of paper on her pillow. 'Went to train on my own in the mountains, hope you slept well, I sure did. Good Morning. Love Tanya.' Rue sighed and sat up. Well she wanted to train by herself that would be all right for today anyway. Rue grabbed his sword and did the same except in the large clearing.

        Tanya had been training for a few hours now sweat was dripping from every available surface. She leaned against the warm rock wall of the mountain her hands sprawled out flat against the stone. Tanya heard a distant rattling moving faster then anything should move but paid it no attention. When Tanya opened her eyes a man stood in front of her all"

Rue woke up suddenly feeling the cold night wind on his face. Rue looked over to the open window and noticed a black wing on the sill. ""Shit! Where did he fly off to!?"" Rue yelled getting out of bed and running down the stairs to the girl's room. He knocked fiercely trying to get the girls attention. Tanya opened the door mumbling. ""What?"" she said in a soft voice. ""Kyoi's gone missing"" Rue said surveying her, ""flew off somewhere."" Natasha immediately looked awake, ""What? Where?"" she said in a bit of a panicked voice. ""I have no idea"" Rue said shrugging ""but we can track him down, it just might take awhile."" ""Get the guy's we'll all get dressed"" Tanya sighed closing the door.

Rue walked down the stairs and listened to the words that Diar was saying in his sleep. ""Meaghan I love you please don't leave me, be mine forever"" Diar said in a high-pitched voice. Rue just rolled his eyes and kicked Diar in the side. ""What!"" Diar yelled in alarm. ""Kyoi's gone were going to go out for a hunt"" Rue said poking Adam in the side. ""I don't care about that idiot,"" Diar said with a scowl. ""You should he's a very good person"" Rue said sitting down on a chair. ""Not to me he isn't"" Diar growled. ""Shut up he tries to be good to you but you always act like an idiot"" Rue said smirking. Diar opened up his mouth to argue but closed it not knowing what to say. ""Now get dressed we have to go look for the jackass"" Rue said smiling.

Natasha looked at the other girls thinking if Kyoi was alright. ""He'll be fine Natasha"" Tanya said with a reassuring smile. ""He might get hurt."" Natasha thought of all the possibilities. ""I think a guy that used to be an evil war lord will be fine,"" Tanya said sitting down beside Natasha. Natasha looked at her and nodded ""I guess your right.""

Kyoi flew through the cold breeze. The wind making his hair go back in a dance. He extended his wings to there full length flying at top speeds. He smiled at the feeling of flying alone at night; he hadn't done that in a long time. Seeing a huge shape flying through the air meters in front of him made him smile. ""Darak!"" Kyoi yelled catching up to the large black dragon with red glowing eyes. The spikes on this dragon were larger then the spikes on all the other dragons. The dragon looked back at Kyoi with its long neck. It gave out a screech of excitement the screech carrying words only Kyoi could hear. Kyoi frowned and hopped onto the dragons back flying to a hill and giving out a sign of where he was to his friends.

Rue jumped out the window, he had already left a note saying where they had went for Tanya's aunt. He floated in mid air waiting for everyone else to get out to. Natasha extended her brown earthen wings looking around for any signs of Kyoi. The rest of the group came out some slightly shivering. ""Now to see where the baka went"" Rue said raising his hands into the air watching as a signal was sent off miles away. ""That was very easy, guess Kyoi's not that big of an idiot, and we thought it would be hard"" Rue started to laugh. Rue immediately raced through the air leaving no room for anyone to ask why he was laughing. They followed close behind wings extended well except for Rue he had none.

Kyoi watched the darkness as the sound of wings broke the silent breeze. ""Hello"" he waved to the winged figures. ""Why did you leave without saying anything?!"" Natasha yelled. 'I had expected that'. ""You know what it's like to see a dragon,"" Kyoi smirked patting the scaly skin of Darak. ""My friend here has given me some good information on the man named Shadow"" Kyoi smirked around the circle. ""He is the ruler of a dark castle, could quite possibly be my old one. Anyway from Darak's information he has come up with a plan to send the world into darkness this plan he had almost completed years ago but his host had died. Since Shadow is really a Shadow possessing bodies to do his dirty work."" Kyoi frowned clenching his fists. ""Kyoi do you think you were the person Shadow possessed?"" Natasha asked sitting down. ""Somehow I think so,"" Kyoi said hesitantly. ""That means that this Shadow may still have the likings to the same women."" Rue crossed his arms. ""Cran said something about there being a use for me"" Tanya said reluctantly seeing everyones faces. ""And you didn't tell us this because?"" Natasha asked looking Tanya in the eye. ""It slipped my mind"" Tanya said in a low voice. ""So you need extra protection,"" Rue said sitting near here. ""All we need to do now is think of a way of action,"" Adam said sitting down. The sun appeared over the fill bathing them in a light glow. ""Since we found my dragon were to next?"" Kyoi asked standing up. ""I think we should go to Italy"" Rue smiled for some odd reason. They all looked at him, shrugged and opened up the portals..

Chapter 12: Megumi the Dragon of Fire
Kyoi stepped out of his portal looking around at the gondolas in the river to the right. 'So many fucking couples.' Kyoi sat down on an iron bench waiting for the others to appear. 'I can't take much more of that romantic giggling.' Diar appeared and sat down beside him ""Hello hun"" Diar said putting his arm around him. Kyoi glared at him and shoved his arm off his shoulder ""What took you so long?"" ""Well I got a little side tracked"" Diar said smiling and shifting his eyes over to Meaghan. ""Oh god."" Kyoi rolled his eyes and walked over to the bridge. ""Where are we going to sleep tonight?"" Meaghan asked sitting down on the spot Kyoi had been. ""On the street,"" Adam laughed sarcastically sitting beside Diar. ""Were not going to sleep on the street,"" Tanya sighed looking at all the names on the buildings. Rue walked beside Kyoi and then to the gondolas below. ""I have an idea,"" Rue said smirking. ""And what is this idea of yours?"" Kyoi asked looking at his happy face. ""It's a surprise"" Rue waved walking after Tanya and whispering something to her that made her laugh. ""Fuck, hate it when he has an idea that he makes a surprise."" Kyoi mumbled looking down into the blue water.

""Dude, I'm a daisy, daisy, I want to marry you!"" Brock sang happily on a rooftop. Cran growled looking down at the group of youths below. ""Dude, will you marry me?"" Brock asked right in Cran's face. ""What?! NEVER!"" Cran yelled punching Brock in the stomach. Some people looked up from the street below but Cran had disappeared. ""Never do that again! Damn you! You almost blew our cover!"" Cran yelled at Brock. ""I would never ever marry your sorry ass. For one I'm not gay and two I'm superior to you in everyway!"" Cran yelled his fists now shaking. ""Idiot."" Cran mumbled perching himself on the edge of another roof.

""Did you hear that?"" Tanya asked looking up at the roof. ""Yeah I didn't like it either"" Rue said frowning pulling Tanya closer to him. ""You know I'm not completely defenseless"" Tanya smiled. ""Sure."" Rue said sarcastically hugging her. ""Oh you inspire so much confidence in me"" Tanya said sarcastically laughing with him. That's when she spotted a hotel and ran in to order a room since two was a wee bit expensive. ""Okay I got us all a room!"" Tanya said walking out of the hotel a key dangling in her hand.

""It's too romantic here,"" Natasha said looking at all the gondolas on the river. ""Romance is a beautiful thing"" Diar said smiling ""You should be proud of it."" They all stared at Diar for a minute thinking of what he had just said. ""Diar are you feeling alright?"" Meaghan asked feeling his forehead. ""With you this close to me I couldn't be better"" Diar smiled largely. ""Okay he's fine"" Meaghan said walking over to the bridge. They all rolled their eyes and relaxed again. ""Are you ever serious?"" Stephanie asked now sitting beside him. ""I'm always serious"" Diar said feeling the back of the iron bench. They all sweat dropped and looked into the water silence breaking over them for now.

Cran glared at all the couples on the gondolas 'maybe I should have some fun'. 'All this romance is killing me'. Cran stood up and jumped to the ground heading over to the gondolas. ""Let's blow something up shall we"" Cran said raising his hand an orb of black energy appearing there. ""Die!"" He yelled chucking the energy at a couple kissing.

Rue felt the energy and ran over to the source. Seeing the familiar dark red eyes and smirk he knew there was going to be trouble. ""Kyoi!"" Rue yelled seeing his friend already beside him. The youth across the water raised his hands dark energy appearing in them. ""Shit!"" Rue said rising from the ground as the orb was shot at a couple in a gondola. Kyoi did the same both charging at the both a protective shield of black and green encircled the gondola, unnoticeable by humans. Yet it wouldn't matter since they could see them fly 'oh well if it was there lives let them think there are angels in this world, even though there aren't, just the saviors the Kurai'. Cran smirked at the battle that was about to begin. He rose up in the air a sword of a black metal appeared in his hands. He stopped right in front of them looking them over. ""So it's you two again,"" Cran laughed looking at them. ""DIE!"" They both yelled in unison swords of a black and green metal appearing for them. One made of darkness the other of wind. They charged at him swiping at him in various areas. Cran dodged with deadly precision. ""Kyoi!"" Rue yelled moving back a bit giving Kyoi the hint. Kyoi started to attack alone as the wind around them picked up. Suddenly, the water under cran's feet started to ripple encircled him with a lot of pressure. Stephanie waved at the guys from the bridge. Cran emerged from the water glaring at Stephanie ""That was a big mistake!"" He flew towards Stephanie inches from her face with his sword. The bridge grew Cran smashed into it cursing loudly. Meaghan smiled from the top of the wall looking down at the black haired warrior. He looked up and took a jab at her with his sword missing her face by an inch. ""Bitch! Don't ever hurt Cran!"" Cran yelled looking at Meaghan's smiling face. ""What you want to race?"" Tanya said smiling a little further down the wall. Cran smiled too looking at the girl he wanted so much. Flame wings appeared from her back and she took off flying past Rue with ease. Cran followed her at great speeds quickly catching up with her. ""Your on fire!"" Tanya yelled an orb appearing in her hand that was barely visible. Cran looked at her curiously when she moved her hand towards him he grabbed her and pulled her closer. Until he felt the clothes on his back burst into flame. She flew quicker then Cran could back to the wall winking at Rue. Cran cursed disappearing to somewhere again.

Natasha saw Tanya fly back and land on the normal wall. Natasha smiled and gave her friend a thumbs-up. ""What did you think?"" Tanya asked smiling ""Was I on fire?"" Natasha smiled at Tanya's wording ""You rocked.I'm just disappointed I couldn't help."" Tanya ran over to Rue who had landed and whispered something to him. ""Okay guys were going to take the scenic route to the hotel"" Rue said smiling. ""But it's right there"" Meaghan pointed down the small street. ""Just take the scenic route"" Tanya ushered the gang down the street in the opposite direction. When they got to the side of the river where a few gondolas were lined up Tanya smiled. ""Oh I want a picture of each pair in a gondolas!"" Tanya smiled taking out a camera. The man standing there had untied them so when two stepped in he would release and send them down the river. ""Okay, Diar and Meaghan in the first one, Adam and Stephanie in the second, Kyoi and Natasha in the third, and me and Rue in the last!"" Tanya smiled handing the camera to the guy secretly holding the ropes. Meaghan reluctantly stepped in the first gondolas with Diar. Stephanie, Adam, Kyoi, Natasha, Rue and Tanya did the same. When the boats slowly moved forward the group all looked back at the smiling Tanya and Rue. They glared and the four gondolas service guys steered the boats down the river.

Meaghan glared back at Tanya who was talking to Rue his arm around her. Diar was trying to start a conversation but was failing miserably. ""Meaghan please talk to me,"" Dair said giving meaghan his puppy dogface. ""What do you want to talk about?"" Meaghan asked putting some of her attention at Diar. ""How about what you think of me?"" Diar asked smiling. ""I think you're perverted"" Meaghan replied putting her hands in her lap. ""That is sorta true but, everyone is perverted in there own way"" Diar replied staring into her blue eyes. ""I guess your right, so I guess you're a pretty cool guy. Kind of cute too"" Meaghan said smiling getting more relaxed by the sudden aroma in the air.

Adam and Stephanie just kept on talking not shutting up since they were friends before hand at school they could talk easily not caring about what they said. It even went onto the topic of how to of fish in truth they were just friend talking not couple talking.

Kyoi glared back at Rue then shrugged he knew something like this was going to happen. ""Aren't they a cute couple?"" Natasha asked looking back at them. ""Their love has never wavered"" Kyoi said crossing his arms. 'Hey I got an idea.' ""Do you think you and I would be a good couple?"" Kyoi asked smirking to himself. ""Yeah, we might make a good couple"" Natasha said blushing slightly. ""Good"" Kyoi lowered himself to her lips and kissed her gently, and then it got more passionate as Natasha complied.

""That's so cute"" Tanya said holding her hands up in triumph. Rue smiled and turned to her. Rue looked at her and kissed her on the forehead. Tanya hugged him and smiled leaning onto his chest. When Kyoi glanced back Rue gave him the thumbs-up and smiled. ""What's the hotel like?"" Rue asked hoping they got their own bed. ""One king sized bed. It was the only room I could afford. A few of you have to sleep on the floor,"" Tanya smiled strangely. ""Oh that's just great. I have to sleep on a fucking floor,"" Rue said sarcastically. ""It's all the better to watch over me"" Tanya smiled placing a long index finger on his chest kissing him on the lips. 'She had never really taken charge before it had always been Rue but it was a pleasant change.'

Cran watched from one of the gondolas close behind he had killed the worker who rowed it so he could follow the group easily. ""Dude, I want to be a fish, one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish!"" Brock laughed his eyes closed in pure excitement. Cran clenched the stick that he used for rowing any second now he would snap from the horrible cackling of that damn queer. ""Dude, I wanna be a daisy too!"" Brock laughed once again. That was it the stick plummeted through the air hitting Brock in the jaw, sending him into the wall of a building. 'Beautiful, beautiful, peace'. He noticed the couples ahead and growled at the sounds of giggling. 'I hate the sound of all types of laughter except my own and my masters.' He watched as they went over to a hotel and watched as Brock crawled back into the gondolas soaking wet.

Rue walked into the one bedroom hotel room and saw the size of the king sized bed. The day had been quite exhausting and they all wanted to go to bed. ""Okay so who's sleeping in the bed?"" Meaghan asked sitting in one of the two chairs in the room. ""It might be able to fit six so the four girls and all boys sleep on floor!"" Tanya said smiling. ""Wait! That is so not fair! I'm sleeping in the bed too! Adam and me! The other guys they, they can sleep on the floor!"" Diar yelled putting his foot to the ground. The two boys growled and slowly sank to the ground in a sitting position. The girls went into the washroom to get changed while the boys dressed in the bedroom. The girls waited until them heard Diar's shouts stop when they walked outside. They crawled into the bed smiling for the beautiful night. They had toyed with the guy named Cran. And had gone on a romantic ride in gondolas what could be better!?

Rue smiled in the darkness Kyoi seeing him. ""What are you smiling about?"" Kyoi asked smiling himself. ""I forgot you could see me. You finally took a stance, I'm proud"" Rue replied leaning against the wall. ""You should never underestimate the power and eyes of the dark,"" Kyoi said leaning into the wall as well. ""I'll keep that in mind"" Rue yawned his eyes slowly closing. ""I'll watch over them tonight. You've done it to many times"" Kyoi patted his friend on the shoulder his eyes wide in alert.

The sun poured into the room covering Kyoi in happy sunrays making him look better then usual. Tanya awoke jumping off the end of the bed and heading over to him. ""Have you been up all night?"" Tanya asked deadly close to his face. ""Yes, he needed to rest"" Kyoi swallowed his eyes slowly turning black. Tanya looked questionably at him then shook his shoulders. ""You alright?"" Tanya asked checking his eyes over again. ""What?"" Kyoi asked not knowing what had happened. ""Uh. never mind"" Tanya stood up and walked into the bathroom to take a shower. The others woke up soon afterward each one taking there turn in the shower. ""So where are we going?"" Tanya asked her hair slightly wet so it looked like it was in clumps. ""The volcano"" Rue replied opening the window. ""The volcano?"" Tanya looked at him questionably. ""Your dragons there"" Rue said jumping and flying off. ""Oh, Now I wish I wore something thinner"" Stephanie said looking at her sweater. They all jumped out the window heading to the volcano at great speeds.

They came to the volcano most of them staying away from the lava by about a hundred feet. Tanya shrugged and headed closer not phased by the heat at all. She touched the lava and felt a surge of emotion flow through her. She took a few breaths and saw her dragons head emerge from the volcano. It's red eyes danced like the lava. Its dark red scales glowed threatingly in the lava as well. It had long black spikes and horns emerging from its head the only part Tanya could see. Tanya patted the hard warm scales of the dragon and smiled seeing steam rise from its nostrils. ""Going good down there!"" Adam yelled from a distance. Tanya smiled and gave the dragon a final pat before flying back up to her friends. When she met her friends they were greeted with a different smile that only Rue could remember. 'She's been filled with her strongest emotion again'.

Rue looked at the group and put up one hand to silence them all. ""It's about time you all learned how to make your own portals"" Rue smiled. They all looked at him a little curious. ""And how do we do that?"" Meaghan asked looking at Rue. ""Well our next location is the city of light and then our dragon search will be over"" Rue cocked his head to one side. ""Meaghan now that you know the location follow me"" Rue lowered himself to the ground quickly, Meaghan following. ""All you have to do is think of the location concentrate and you should be able to open up your portal and go where you want"" Rue instructed. Meaghan concentrated on city of light and turned into stone then disappeared in dust. Rue smiled and headed back up to the rest of the group. ""Some of you travel slower then others so it may take some time to meet up with everyone. Natasha yours is the only other one that can only be done on the ground the rest can be done everywhere"" Rue said and everyone concentrated on their destination Natasha going to the ground. Kyoi wrapped himself in darkness and Diar in light they both disappeared. Natasha was wrapped with Earth and sucked into it. Stephanie turned to water and evaporated. Tanya turned to a small flame and disappeared in the wind like a shooting star. Adam turned into Lightning and was gone in a flash. Rue smiled and turned into the wind. If anyone had seen this they would be very confused, except for the dark eyes that watched them from a castle in the sky..

Chapter 13: The Last and Final Dragon, Lagaia
Adam appeared into a rough valley caves coming out of every surface of the walls. The place seemed to along time ago be a city of some sort. Kind of surprised that he was the first one that arrived he leaned on the surface of one of the rocks perturbing from the ground. When he looked up and felt the gentle caress of rain he smiled. Seeing the rain take shape into a blue transparent figure. ""Why hello"" Stephanie said smiling her blue skin turning quickly back to peach. They sat there together for a time looking at the beautiful rock structures and formations. There was a small disturbance in the air as darkness and light made a ripple on the serene landscape. Kyoi and Diar appeared at the same time darkness and light walking together. It seemed strange to see both of them nod at each other and smile. It was like a strange fantasy movie where light and dark became one and beat the greatest evil, but it seemed right. They all looked up to the sky to see the wind pick up and fire push through it growing into two human shapes. ""Hello"" Tanya smiled walking like nothing had happened to the big slab of rock. Just two more people and it would all be good. Natasha appeared from the dirt she seemed to be made of it until it fell and showed her true body. ""Meaghan may take awhile"" Natasha sighed sitting on the ground. Around fifteen minutes later there was finally a disturbance in the ground. A rock statue came exultantly out of the ground slowly turning into an actual human. ""Yeah I'm the first one here!"" Meaghan shouted not yet noticing the others. ""Actually Meaghan you're the last"" Natasha shrugged getting off the ground.

Diar looked at them all his subtle gray eyes turning vibrant, shimmering silver. The marks on the side of his face flared as he walked by the group. ""The monsters in the caves will not attack while I walk on there land"" Diar said his voice serious. They all smiled at him Kyoi had released his wings shielding him from the light. ""As soon as we find Lagaia our power will grow stoutly"" Rue smirked pointing to the gems on their foreheads. ""They will glow and fuel us to a new level of power"" Rue walked away after Diar. The rest of the group felt there gems no warm came from them, no security.

""Do we go Shadow when we finish with the dragon search?"" Tanya asked running up beside Rue. ""No, we then have to find our second sense of power, our weapons. Each one of us will find it in a different way. One will find it in their element, in a loved one, in fear, the urge to protect, from our soul companion, in an enemy, lost in another's mind, and lastly one will find it in themselves"" Rue said looking at all the stunned faces. ""The second journey will be hard. Much harder then the first since there are so many ways we must find it"" Rue continued looking into one of the caves where he saw a unicorn emerge and drink from a crystal blue stream. Tanya smiled seeing the unicorn somehow it brought reassurance that they would win. ""Won't that search be really hard? How would it work?"" Adam asked close behind Rue. ""It'll happen on instinct you don't have to try every way it will happen by fate. Whatever the weapon fells is in your heart, weather your heart may desire, power, love, fear, security, fondness, reassurance, hope, and kindness."" Rue looked over at Adam who hadn't truly understood him. ""You will know in time"" Rue looked back up to Diar noticing a temple emerging around the corner. It wasn't truly a temple it had long since been destroyed and decayed but the light kept it how it was; it was now only a ruin.

""We will wait for you"" Kyoi said leaning on a wall not trusting himself in there. Diar nodded and smiled rushing into the ancient ruin. ""Something's not right"" Natasha's elfish ears perked up ""it just got quieter."" The rest noticed this standing up. They heard a scream of pain from behind them as a dark figure came out of the temple caring the limp Diar. ""What have you done to him?!"" Meaghan yelled in tears. He threw him to the ground in disgust. ""Pitiful humans"" it mumbled looking at the group its crimson eyes landing on Tanya. From somewhere in her subconscious she remembered that look from along time ago the look that the thing that possessed Kyoi had. ""Shadow"" Tanya whispered making the figure laugh menacingly. Meaghan crouched by Diar glaring at the form of Shadow. ""Yes, my name is Shadow just in the body of a fool who had walked into my path, a handsome fool. And I will complete my plans this time"" Shadow smiled stepping closer to Tanya. ""Niaka"" Shadow whisper inches away from her. Time seemed to slow as Rue jumped into Shadow punching hard in the face. ""Rue!"" Tanya screamed turning around to look at the attack. Both of them were back on their feet swords in their hands. ""You killed my host along time ago, but I'll keep on coming back to haunt you if you kill this one"" Shadow smiled seeing how his words had worked. ""I was your host your fight should be with me,"" Kyoi said stepping in front of Rue. ""Pitiful, your weak"" Shadow said laughing, ""you're a disappointment son."" The words had phased Kyoi greatly his eyes glazing over for a minute. ""You mother fucker,"" Kyoi whispered glaring at Shadow. ""You killed my mother, that's when you possessed me. You made me kill her thinking some evil had went into her son! You son of a bitch! You fucking asshole! You ruined my fucking life!"" Kyoi yelled now rage making the ground tremble.

Shadow smiled at his son ""Yes she was a very pretty one. But being a service to the light I had to kill her. She was good indeed, and then she had a weakling son that I had thought was strong. I was too blind at the time in my shadow form I possessed you and died trying to make my plans come true."" ""And what are your plans?"" Rue asked from behind Kyoi his voice a growl. ""It has something to do with the yousei"" Shadow smirked looking at the group. Tanya walked to Rue's side and smiled ""well if you want me you can't have me."" Shadow smirked ""I can do whatever I please. You will be my wife sooner then you think."" ""I don't think so"" Tanya leaned into Rue and kissed him on the lips making Shadow growl. ""So you pick that weak fool. He will soon be dead once my plans are complete."" Shadow took out his sword and struck Kyoi with it

Inches from Kyoi's face the sword had stopped. The ground had started to tremble and Shadow had stopped. The ground suddenly burst under his feet a bright white-scaled dragon with golden eyes emerged glaring down at Shadow. It's screech a beautiful but, deafened sound to Shadow he clutched his ears and fell to the ground cursing. He disappeared Diar awakening at that moment to look up at his dragon. ""Lagaia, thank you"" Diar said slowly stumbling to his feet. He patted the dragon on the hard armour of its skull. It screeched again it's beautiful song and kneeled before its master. The gem on everyone's head flared and each one was filled with a happy sensation. ""And now"" Rue said, ""we look for our strength."" Each one of the group but two fingers to the gems and felt the warmth come off of them the security of having more power. ""Let's go"" Natasha smiled concentrating on a single place they had agreed on before. The forests in Canada, home..

Chapter 14: Returning Home
Natasha looked over to the familiar school that they had gone to, not a sound could be heard. ""We should go see our parents"" Stephanie said leaning on the fence staring at the kids working inside. ""Yeah I miss mine"" Natasha said walking in the direction to her house. ""I guess we'll meet up here later"" Tanya said waving to the group. Rue sat down on the cement looking at all the girls and Adam leave. ""It's good to see family again"" Diar smiled then stopped looking at Kyoi. ""I should have known! Damn Bastard!"" Kyoi clutched his fists and sat down on the cement. ""It's alright man,"" Rue said putting his hand on Kyoi's shoulder ""we'll just have to beat the crap out of him over and over again."" Kyoi smiled and looked over at Rue ""but I'll be the one to kill him.""


Tanya walked to her house suddenly feeling very tired. ""I want my bed,"" She mumbled nearly walking into a pole. Tanya passed her house not even noticing it when she looked up she grumbled and walked back. She knocked on the door when no body answered she remembered they had a doorbell. ""Duh?"" She said to herself ringing it two times hard so it could be heard from downstairs because of the extension. Tanya's mom rushed to the door mumbling something, seeing her daughter's face her face lit up. She embraced Tanya in a tight hug and kissed her forehead ""I missed you so much!"" ""I missed you to mom"" Tanya said falling asleep in her mom's arms. ""Poor girl, RICK!"" Tanya's mom called waiting; for her son to come. ""Carry Tanya to her bed"" she commanded. Rick did what he was told. He was a tall 20 year old who still lived in the house without a car. He had dark black hair and was about 6 foot 5. Rick put Tanya in her bed then sat there for a minute ""take it easy dumb ass.""

Natasha headed for her house happy to be back home. She opened the front door and shouted ""Mom!"" Natasha's mom looked out of the kitchen ""Natasha?"" then ran to the doorway ""oh my god baby!"" Natasha's mom hugged her and Natasha hugged back. ""Mom I missed you so much"" Natasha said hugging her mom back. ""You look so tired"" Natasha's mom said rubbing the hair out of her eyes. ""Yeah I am"" Natasha rubbed her eyes leaning into her mom. ""Get some rest I'll make you a big dinner"" Natasha's mom led Natasha to her room and went back to the kitchen. ""Yeah! A big dinner!"" Natasha said before falling on her bed soon falling asleep.

When Meaghan came back to her house the first thing she felt was her mom hugging her. ""Thank god your alright!"" Meaghan's mom cried tears flowing freely from her cheeks. ""Tell me what happened"" Meaghan's mom ushered her into the family room. Soon her dad and sister was there to and even there dog Magnum. ""Well let's see we traveled some of the world in this how many days was it? Anyway, I got my dragon her name is Sadaharu she's the dragon of stone, to tell you the truth she's almost the size of this street. I have a crush on this guy named Diar. And I have powers I can demonstrate for you outside"" Meaghan smiled but then frowned as her mom fainted. ""Okay. That didn't go the way I planned"" Meaghan said standing up and grabbing her sketchbook.

Stephanie opened the door of her house and found her mom upstairs with her sister. ""Mom I'm home"" Stephanie said running up the stairs. ""Honey I'm glad your back!"" Steph's mom ran up to her and hugged her. ""I missed you mom,"" Stephanie said rubbing her stomach. ""I'll go cook you something"" Steph's mom ran to the kitchen as Stephanie went to her room and hugged her PS2. ""All my treasures!"" She yelled happily falling on her bed. Stephanie held her PS2 to her and slowly fell asleep.

Adam stepped into his house. His parents were gone and he didn't know when they'd be back so he just decided to sleep. He grabbed some milk and a bit of food and headed for the television to eat. After around an hour he slowly drifted off to a dreamless sleep.

It was getting very dark and the moon began to rise. ""Does it always take this long?"" Kyoi asked still leaning on the same spot of the fence. ""Yes, Kyoi it takes a long time"" Rue said pacing, which he had been doing for the past 3 hours. ""Why aren't you talking? You're making me uneasy"" Kyoi growled looking over at Diar. ""And what the hell do you want me to say, your highness?"" Diar growled back. ""I just want you to talk god damn it!"" Kyoi jumped up glaring at Diar. ""Okay I'll talk. Kyoi you're a gay fag!"" Diar yelled pointing to Kyoi. ""And you're a fucking retard!"" Kyoi yelled back. Rue started to laugh at the fight that was starting. ""You wanna go!"" Diar yelled hitting his chest. ""You weak fool!"" Kyoi yelled back his arm in the air. ""I'll kick your ass!"" Dair said in a slightly high-pitched voice. ""You could never kick my ass"" Kyoi yelled in a threatening sort of way. ""You guys are evenly matched if anyone would get there asses kicked it would be you two against me"" Rue smiled looking at there reactions. ""You couldn't beat both of us!"" They said in unison. ""Wanna try?"" Rue threatened motioning them towards him. They both smiled and lunged at him. ""Ah, ah, ah"" Rue said easily jumping out of the way. A small bit of green appeared around Rue's body turning his skin a soft green. He flew towards them the wind pushing them back. ""Rue! Cut it out!"" Tanya yelled from the sidewalk. ""What?"" Rue asked looking up at her soft face. ""You were attacking them"" Tanya replied walking down the sidewalk. ""They challenged me,"" Rue pouted looking at the woman. ""Is this a challenge?"" Tanya asked kissing him on the side of his neck. ""It should be"" He smiled wickedly.

Tanya had gotten up a few hours later feeling well rested. She had ate and everything, said goodbye to her parents again who had got all emotional. But she told them she would be back. Right now Tanya had to get back to the others they were probably killing each other. When Tanya got to where the guys were before she saw an interesting sight. Rue was fighting both Kyoi and Diar but when Rue got started up it wasn't good. ""Rue! Cut it out!"" Tanya yelled running down the sidewalk. ""What?"" He asked looking at her eyes. ""You were attacking them Tanya blushed feeling his intense stare. ""They challenged me,"" Rue pouted looking more closely at Tanya. ""Is this a challenge?"" Tanya asked not knowing what she was doing but found herself kissing Rue's neck. ""It should be,"" He purred. ""Where are the others?"" Kyoi asked not wanting them to go to far on an open street. ""They come when they feel like coming"" Tanya replied pulling away. Diar pouted and sat down ""not even a good fight."" ""You would have been dead"" Tanya said closing her eyes. ""No we would have kicked his ass!"" Diar shouted knowing she was right beside him. ""Don't yell in my ear!"" Tanya yelled back. ""Make me!"" Diar continued to yell standing up. ""Fine!"" Tanya said slapping her hand over his mouth making it glow. A small muffled sound that sounded like 'SORRY, SORRY, SORRY!' came from Diar he looked completely frightened. ""Fine"" Tanya shrugged taking her hand away from Diar's mouth. Both Rue and Kyoi were laughing uncontrollably. ""What?"" Diar asked them rubbing his warm mouth. ""You got told by a women!"" Kyoi laughed harder. ""Do you want to be told?"" Tanya asked smiling. They both stopped laughing and looked at her.

Natasha ate her dinner and went back to bed. It was morning the time she woke up, she said goodbye, to her parents, and said she would be back soon. Natasha ran to the school and found four people sleeping there. ""How was your night?"" Natasha asked smiling. 'I got a bed and they slept on cement.' Kyoi opened his eyes and smiled ""Cement hurts."" ""I bet"" She smiled looking at the others. Tanya opened her eyes and turned to Natasha ""Good morning."" Natasha smiled as she saw the others walk to the group. ""How was everyone's sleep"" Natasha asked. ""Great!"" They yelled but the people on the ground just mumbled and itched their backs. ""Well it's your own fault"" Natasha said spreading her arms wide in a yawn. ""Yeah!"" the four said sarcastically. ""She's right you know"" Adam said picking up Diar. ""You could have asked to come over"" Adam finished putting Diar on his feet. People started to pile in to school one or two looked back at the people by the fence.

""Should we put on our uniforms?"" Meaghan asked no one in particular. ""Yeah the fast way though it would do with some good to check out the school"" Rue said snapping his fingers. They all did the same and headed for there regular classes. ""Not math!"" Adam yelled slightly pissed ""I never want to take another math class again!"" ""Too bad"" Rue smiled pulling him in. ""Excuse me, who do you think you are barging into my class?"" Mr. Fisert asked sternly. ""I'm terribly sorry Mr. Fisert. I'm Tanya you remember me right? This is Natasha, Stephanie, Meaghan, Adam, Rue, Kyoi, and Diar"" Tanya said happily. ""Oh welcome back how long will you be here?"" Mr. Fisert asked observing the group. ""Just a day were going to check out the school"" Tanya smiled taking her old seat. Most of the boy's in the class watched the girls as they took their seats the girls did the same with the boys. ""Now to find circumference"" Mr. Fisert began but stopped feeling a terrible tremble. Most of the class screamed and jumped under there desks. ""What the hell?"" Diar jumped up and opened a window. The group of eight jumped out of the window and headed for the field. ""It seems like it stopped"" Stephanie said looking at her surroundings. ""No it's still somewhere around here"" Natasha said looking closely at the ground. Suddenly, the earth became black and sucked them into it from then on it went all black..

Chapter 15: Vortex of Destiny (Part 1)
Meaghan stood alone in a sea of darkness the only thing she could feel was falling. ""I hate this! Please stop!"" Meaghan yelled to the darkness. The darkness spoke to her briefly in a woman's voice. 'Only from a true and loyal companion can you find your strength and from this strength many more emotions will be found.' Below her feet the darkness turned into stone and dirt and the Grand Canyon slowly formed. ""What the hell?"" Meaghan asked no one in particular. Only then noticing that no one else was there. ""Natasha! Stephanie! Tanya! Diar! Kyoi! Adam! Rue!"" Meaghan yelled thinking back to what had happened. The ground opened and we were all swallowed by darkness. Meaghan started to walk and came to a small statue in the wall. It was about 2 feet tall and 4 feet wide a statue of Sadaharu. There was something about this statue that drove Meaghan's curiosity so she sat by it, examining it for a time.

Adam looked around him the darkness withering to a room of a bright white colour. A female voice could be heard from the receding shadows. 'In one fear there can be many, in those many fears there can be more, in reality people are afraid of everything. Can you conquer that?' Adam shivered looking closely around the small room.

Kyoi opened his eyes fueled by the darkness till it started to recede a beautiful voice echoed across it. 'It is in those we love that we need to protect, in protection comes loyalty from that great love, once two people are made loyal the rest will flow into place'. Kyoi glanced one last time into the darkness then at the valley full of monsters. ""Damn"" he whispered crouching down as not to be seen. ""What the hell did that voice mean?"" Kyoi asked himself looking at the biggest monster seemed to be a wolf demon. ""No problem"" Kyoi smiled and made his sword of darkness appear.

Natasha floated downwards eyes closed, until she heard the voice of the women. 'In a loved one we find security and protection, we may also find the greatest strength of all'. ""What the hell was that about!?"" Natasha yelled making her earth sword appeared. Grass had appeared beneath her feet and a forest all around her. The group sat by the fire there eyes pitch black. 'There fakes' Natasha thought sitting down.

Stephanie fell into a world of water looking around at the sea of blue; she saw the image of a woman with pitch black eyes and black hair. 'It is in our element that we feel safe. Deep down we all know that deep waters do not hind all secrets'. The face faded and the water began to glow. Stephanie dived deep till she felt the water getting colder. Many strange creatures swam beside her but she was focusing on the riddle the woman had said.

Diar closed his eyes shut not wanting to lose consciousness. 'The darkness here may not hurt you. For darkness clouds many minds search through the minds that you know to find the strength that you need but do not dig too deep for some hold secrets that are to harsh even for you.' Diar opened his eyes and found himself in a circle with his friends. ""Hey guys"" Diar waved sitting down. They all looked up at him their eyes blank with blackness. ""Great"" Diar rolled his eyes sarcastically. He then closed his eyes and focused on what he wanted to see.

Rue fell deep into the darkness waiting for his feet to hit the ground. When they finally did he was in a giant room completely black. Two giant chairs sat at the front of the hall. In one sat Shadow smirking at Rue and in the other chair sat a woman with black eyes, black, hair, and black clothes. She spoke in an inaudibly whisper that seemed to flow to the depths of Rue's brain. 'You find your strength in defending your friends and loved ones. When a friend is hurt you will go to the ends of the earth to find and kill the person that did it. It is in this quality that you find your greatest strength. Evil aren't you? I like that.' Rue growled 'I got someone thank you'. She smiled and waved a hand at him 'one day you will live to regret you said that'. 'I never will' Rue smiled walking towards Shadow 'if you don't mind I want to sever my enemies heart'. 'That would be welcome to him take away his pain'. The woman smiled and opened her eyes fully showing nothing but pure darkness. 'Fight!'

Tanya fell through the darkness her eyes tight shut ""Oh my god I hate this I'm going to fall to my death"" Tanya cried. ""I'm going to die!"" Tanya screamed putting her hands in front of her face. 'You aren't going to die here. Open your eyes and see what your mind has formed.' Tanya opened her eyes slowly and looked around at the plain that had formed. There were many sparkling streams and rivers everywhere. 'Now listen to me carefully. You find your strength in yourself. Through your emotions, dreams, and horrors.' The women's voice faded and all that was left was silence. Tanya sighed and sat down by one of the streams that glowed a light blue colour. Tanya ran her fingers over the surface of the water and watched as her face rippled away.

""What's taking you so long to make a vortex?"" Shadow asked getting annoyed. ""You are so impatient"" Suko murmured still concentrating. ""Answer me!"" Shadow yelled grabbing her shoulders. ""I'm helping them,"" Suko said calmly. ""What?!"" Shadow yelled gripping her shoulders so tightly his knuckles turned white. ""Weakling"" Suko smiled opening her blank eyes. ""How dare you call me that!""? Shadow yelled taking out his sword. ""Well your scared"" Suko stood up and walked by him calmly. ""I'm not scared"" Shadow said harshly sheathing his sword. ""It sounded like it"" Suko smiled walking out the huge doors.

""I can't believe this!"" Cran bellowed, ""that bitch sent all my fun into a vortex!"" Brock walked around Cran smiling. ""Let's sing!"" Brock screeched excitedly. ""No! Damn it!"" Cran roared pushing the boy to the ground. ""I have no frigging entertainment!"" Brock wailed on the ground rubbing his butt, ""You pushed me!"" Cran cocked an eyebrow at the fallen teenager ""Wow took you long enough to realize."" Brock started to hit Cran's legs with great strength surprisingly. Cran slapped him across the face sending him into tears. ""Freak"" Cran said slowly before walking away.

Meaghan was still sitting by the shadow of Sadaharu. She put a finger on it and examined every inch with her finger. She came to the teeth and was cut by the sharpness. ""Ouch."" Meaghan said looking at the crimson liquid. The action caused the statue to vibrate and shake slowly the statue lowered into the ground leaving behind a hole in the wall. ""I had to bleed on it.interesting"" Meaghan said sarcastically walking into the tunnel. The wall closing behind her, ""Oh great darkness again where's Diar when I need him?"" Meaghan shrugged putting her hand on the wall to guide her.

Adam stared wide-eyed at the spider that was in front of him; it could barely fit in the room. ""Great just great"" Adam whispered grabbing a stick in the corner. ""Ha! If this works I'll kiss Stephanie the next time I see her,"" Adam said bravely getting into a stance. The spider advanced, poison seemed to be dropping from its mouth. ""Peachy"" Adam smiled holding the stick more tightly. Adam noticed a weak part on the floor and lunged for it without thinking. The spider followed him catching him on the shoulder with its fangs. ""Damn"" Adam spoke harshly as the floor gave way. The spider fell as Adam grabbed onto the edge of the hole. His fingers slipped and he fell not knowing if he would survive it.

Kyoi crouched lower behind the rock clutching his sword tighter in his hands. 'There's so many demons.Fuck. Well I better get this over with now.' Kyoi made his wings appear and he flew down with brutal strength. He started his killing spree on a pair of shocked demons. It took awhile but Kyoi finally got pissed and let out his full power killing everything except the wolf demon. ""Hello Devil demon"" The wolf growled threateningly. Kyoi tossed his head back and laughed cruelly, ""I haven't went by that name in a long time."" The wolf demon narrowed his eyes and smirked, ""I have something of yours."" The wolf moved over a bit and showed a chained up Natasha. Kyoi's eyes widened and he gripped his sword tighter ""you'll die!"" The wolf growled more threateningly at Kyoi jumping to rip off his neck.

Natasha looked at the group's unmoving emotionless faces. 'This isn't right' Natasha thought looking closer at everyone. ""Kyoi?"" Natasha asked grabbing his shoulder. Kyoi moved his hand to hers and looked into her eyes. ""Where have you been?"" asked Kyoi monotonously. ""Kyoi."" Natasha moved her hand up to his cheek. Kyoi saw the worry in her face and put his hand to her cheek, ""what's wrong?"" Natasha leaned up against his chest and trembled ""your not yourself."" Kyoi pulled her up to look in his face; he searched her eyes and found nothing but worry. ""What do you mean I'm not myself?"" Kyoi asked squeezing her shoulder's tightly. ""I mean your eyes are black."" Natasha leaned into him again hugging him. 'What's gotten into me, I know he's a fake but then why am I hugging him like he's real?' Natasha asked herself. Kyoi put his arms around her and sighed, ""I don't know."" Kyoi replied putting his head against her head.

'I'm running out of air' Stephanie thought covering her mouth 'why?' She swam to the surface as quick as possible taking in a deep breath. ""The water's too deep"" Stephanie sighed laying on her back. ""Damn"" Stephanie looked into the water wondering how deep it truly was. 'Maybe' Stephanie thought with a smile surrounding her with an air bubble 'I'm such an idiot!' Stephanie swam down to the depths of the water looking at all the creature's pass. Stephanie saw a bit of light and she beamed. 'Yes' Stephanie swam faster to the light adrenaline building in her.

""Who should I search first?"" Diar frowned looking around the circle. His eyes landed on Tanya and he shrugged, he closed his eyes to concentrate. He was greeted by fire and a figure sitting in the middle ""Why have you invaded my mind?"" the form, which was Niaka, asked. ""Niaka?"" Diar asked cocking his head to one side. ""Why have you invaded my mind"" Niaka nodded but spoke up warning that she didn't want to be messed with. ""I need to search for my weapon"" Diar replied bowing to her. ""That is all?"" Niaka asked folding her arms over her chest. ""Yes"" Diar replied simply. ""Permission granted"" Niaka bowed stepping away from a crimson door. ""Niaka?"" Diar touched the doorknob but turned around to look at her. ""What is it Diar?"" Niaka asked a little annoyed. ""Rue."" Diar started but was cut off. ""I know"" Niaka put her finger to Diars lip and smiled sadly, ""It is fine since I am part of her body but I will never control all of her just a fraction."" Diar nodded and opened the door to walk into Tanya's mind. ""Okay what do we have here? Memories of her past life, past, present, secrets, love, future, all those emotions, and oh."" Diar looked at the end door that was completely black with chains on the handle. Diar reached out to it he was inches away when he felt a jolt of pain flow through him.

Rue ran towards Shadow punching him square in the face. 'Hand to hand combat interesting' Rue thought clenching his fists tightly together. Shadow punched him hard in the face causing blood to ooze from Rue's mouth. He spit it on the black rug smiling. ""Did I ruin your floor?"" Rue asked laughing. Shadow cocked an eyebrow at him but attacked again. They were even punch for punch, each one blocking each other with deadly accuracy. Shadow pulled out his sword cutting into Rue's arm. Rue swore feeling the steel hit bone. 'I thought you were going to kill him' the woman's voice flowed into his head mildly amused. 'Death isn't fun without a little bit of pain.' Rue replied smirking. He made his own sword and shoved it into Shadow's stomach. 'We'll start there' Rue sent to the woman.

Tanya was welcomed by Rue's reflection kissing her. Tanya smiled bending closer to the surface. The water glowed and Tanya saw the familiar black room that she had been in, in her past life. Kyoi stroked a finger over her lips smiling ""I don't like your clothes"" Kyoi whispered in her ear. Niaka glared at him watching him cut the fabric with a knife. Tanya looked closer at the image and saw all the lust deep in Kyoi's eyes. ""Those are shadow's eyes"" Tanya said softly watching Kyoi put his mouth to Niaka's. Tanya watched the image fade as a new one appeared. It was the final battle between the kurai and Kyoi. Tanya watched Kyoi each move not like his own. 'I see it now that's not even how Kyoi fights.' Tanya watched at the end of the battle where Rue leaned down and kissed Niaka as she died and the last words he spoke. ""I love you."" but she was already dead. 'That really sucks. that's right after I blanked out in my dream.' Her eye's widened as she watched Rue deliver the final blow to Kyoi. Kyoi's body fell to the ground as his shadow altered and nothing remained. Rue stood there on the floating palace the first tear Tanya ever saw rolled down his face.

Suko walked into a huge black room where she sat on a bed near a mirror. 'I have revealed my power to him, I am no longer his slave.' Suko looked deep into the glassy surface of the mirror as the glass chanced to numerous coulours. The colour's slowly receded as a face swam into view. Rue stood there his left side bloody, staring with glaring green eyes at Shadow. ""One day you will be mine."" Suko whispered.

""I can't believe her,"" Cran paced the school grounds watching the vibrating ground with narrowed eyes. Brock sat near Cran softly sobbing. ""Will you shut the hell up!?"" Cran yelled at Brock. Brock looked up at Cran slowly then looked away ""You're mean."" Brock whispered hitting the ground. Cran shook his head and continued pacing ""well I can't wait for my entertainment to get back so I'll just have to do something else."" Cran looked back to Brock and smiled ""I think I will finally kill you, right here, and right now!""</lj-cut>"

Diar appeared from the portal smiling, ""Finally Warmth!"" The rest of the group stepped up and looked around squinting their eyes in the bright sun. Kyoi appeared and looked down it was probably to bright for him. ""Wow! I want to go swimming!"" Tanya smiled to the group. ""Who brought bathing suits?"" Tanya asked they all shook their heads. ""Well then we'll just have to buy them!"" Tanya went and got her bag and walked away. ""Well are you guys going to stand there all day come on!"" Tanya peered around the corner looking at everyone walk to her. They walked into a store called 'beacia.' ""Okay now you find a bathing suit you like"" Tanya started looking through the racks at the different styles of bathing suits. Rue went over to the guys rack and started looking through it he found a dark green pair of shorts in his size, he smiled and walked to the changing room. He came out a minute later smiling ""It fits."" He sat down and waited for everyone else. Kyoi just looked through the racks in disgust, to many vibrant colours. He finally came to a completely black pair of shorts and walked to the changing room. He came out without a word and sat beside Rue. Diar looked at Kyoi and growled he had found one before him. Diar looked through the rack and found a white one with a black line running down the side. 'Oh yeah I'm going to be sexy in this' he walked to the changing room with a huge smile. He came out and started modeling for everyone to see, then finally sat beside Rue. Natasha found a bluish, turquoise bathing suit; she ran to the changing room and put it on. She came out again sighed and sat in a chair on the other side of the store. Adam smiled pulling out a yellow pair of shorts; he tried them on and then sat beside Kyoi still smiling. Meaghan came to a bathing suit of a dull gray but liked it nonetheless. Tanya found a tankini that was a red and orange mixture, and Stephanie found a light blue bathing suit.

They headed towards the beach when they heard two familiar voices. ""Dude, it's water!"" Brock said his arms around another guy named John Wallace. ""Yeah, dude let's go swimming naked!"" John said running towards the beach. ""Ewww"" Tanya said covering her eyes ""I don't want images today!"" ""Well does everyone want to go swimming?"" Stephanie asked walking to the water. ""I think I'm just going to tan, work on my complexion"" Diar said lying down in the white sand. Meaghan sighed and sat down beside Diar ""Think I'll tan too."" ""I'm going to eat something get something cold under an umbrella"" Kyoi walked away looking down. ""I guess the rest of us our swimming,"" Adam said walking into the water. Natasha and Tanya soon followed with Rue a little bit behind.

The water was pleasantly warm it kinda gave you the impression that everyone in the world took a piss at the exact same time. (Don't think about it, in truth it would be sick) The water was also very calm in spite of the fact that it was really windy. Tanya dived to the bottom looked for cool looking shells and shark teeth. (Got hundreds of em') She saw Natasha dive down and do the same thing they waved at each other through the clear water. They both surfaced and heard a scream that sounded to come from Stephanie. They saw for a split second what looked to be a black frog with red eyes that turned the water red from blood.

Natasha looked to the shore and say Kyoi fighting a guy on a huge frog. The guy had dark black hair red eyes and was wearing all black. Kyoi was knocked to the ground, and the black figure drew out a huge sword that was supported by his clawed hands. Natasha started to swim as fast as she could to the shore to help Kyoi. When she reached it Kyoi had made his Dark Blade and was trying to fight both the frog and the rider at the same time. ""Need some help,"" Natasha said making the sand beneath there feet tremble without notice. ""Get back!"" Kyoi yelled getting hit by the frog's tongue. ""No!"" Spikes appeared under the frog killing it. Kyoi looked at her for a second and gave what looked like his first smile ""Thanks."" ""One question how do you form a sword?"" Natasha asked while the figure advanced. ""Use the sand and picture it as a sword"" Kyoi said keeping his eyes on the guy. ""Okay"" Natasha focused and a sword appeared floating by her hand, she grabbed it and smiled, 'it felt like a real sword.' The guy smirked and said ""Well finally a challenge, my names Cran I'm a warrior for Lord Shadow."" Cran smiled then looked at the two gays a frog jumped out of the water and ate John. ""That's a relief I won't have to listen to him again"" Natasha said smirking, Kyoi did the same. Cran looked at Brock and lifted up his clawed hand Brock started to scream then he slowly died. Yet Brock got up again his eyes black and he headed towards Kyoi. Diar and Meaghan jumped out of nowhere tackling Brock. ""Work on him we'll work on this idiot!"" Diar called out.

Rue had heard the scream of Stephanie and swam to the last spot he had seen Tanya. Both her and Natasha had appeared a minute later a few meters away. Natasha had swum to the shore leaving Tanya there. He saw a black frog swim by Tanya and pull her down. He panicked and dived down to see the frog attacking her on the bottom. He closed his eyes rage building inside of him wind tried to get to him. It finally did, the wind made a funnel like spout in the water that sucked up the frog sending it flying in the air. Rue glared at it and it exploded sending blood and guts to fly everywhere. Rue saw a cave and got Tanya's hand they both swam as fast as they could to it slowly running out of breath. The cave thankfully had an end that was above water so they could breath.

Stephanie had seen the giant frog and had screamed. (Who wouldn't?) The frog took her down to the bottom when Adam got a sharp rock and struck it in its eyes. The frog tackled him into a rock with one thrust making him unconscious. The frog swam towards Stephanie at incredible speeds; a huge clawed scaly hand stopped it. Stephanie looked up to see a blue dragon with glowing yellow eyes. Its spikes were more likes fins. It growled at the frog and took one look at it and it was gone just his bones were left.


Brock headed towards Meaghan laughing like an idiot ""Like dude I'm evil."" Meaghan looked at him and started to laugh. ""Like Dude what?"" Brock stopped staring at Meaghan. Diar jumped onto Brock's back and put a sharp rock through it. ""Dude that wasn't nice"" Brock headed towards Diar. Meaghan looked down to the sand and a figure appeared from it made of sand. It attacked Brock with great force cutting his skin. Diar nodded at Meaghan then light appeared everywhere blinding Brock when the light had disappeared Brock was gone. Meaghan sat on the sand and sighed Diar did the same.

Cran had seen one of his beloved frog minions tossed into the air and broken into a million pieces that's when he got pissed. He headed straight for Natasha and Kyoi attacking with both his clawed hand and his sword. Kyoi could barely hold him off, he growled every time he was almost hit. He changed his target to Natasha but Kyoi jumped in front of him growling. ""Die!"" Kyoi yelled slicing his sword right towards Cran's heart. A bright light appeared and Kyoi fell to the ground his breathing harsh. When the light cleared Cran was gone and so was any sign of his frogs. ""Kyoi you alright?"" Natasha asked crawling up to his side. He was still breathing but it was slow and uneven.

Rue crawled out of the water onto the little space of land above the water. There was only about one meter all around. Tanya crawled out after him very tired from fighting the frog and having to hold her breath so long. Tanya now wished she had stayed in the water it was much warmer then this tiny cave. It didn't help that she was still wearing a bathing suit. She crawled up towards Rue and fell onto the cold wall. ""It's freezing in here"" Tanya said starting to shiver. ""Come here"" Rue said. She nodded slowly then went over to him. Well it was much warmer, much, much warmer. Tanya smiled up at Rue his arms around her. Rue looked down at her and smiled then noticed a disturbance on the water. ""Watch out"" he whispered to her. Tanya looked at the water and a frog suddenly jumped out of it. Rue stood up and glared at the huge frog that was covering most of the cave there was barely any room to run. ""Rue leave this one to me,"" Tanya said to Rue noticing a spot where she could slip into the water. ""What no!"" Rue yelled but it was to late. Tanya had jumped into the water and had started to swim the frog chasing her. Tanya turned around to see the frog easily catching up she tried to light her flame then remember she was underwater 'oh shit.' 'Now I got to think quickly blue flame is strong but can't light in water but white flame can!' A small white flame appeared in her hand it took a lot of energy to summon it and that was just something she didn't have. Tanya chucked the flame at the frog praying that it would hit. When it hit and the frog exploded turning the water a sickening crimson she swam back to the cave now weaker then ever. She took in a deep breath as soon as she surfaced. ""So the frog didn't eat you, next time you want to get killed warn me before hand so I can find your remains and keep them in a jar"" Rue said sarcastically looking down at her. ""Sorry, I had an opening and I took it."" Tanya said looking down still in the water. ""Remember I'm immortal I can't die"" Rue said pulling her out of the water. ""Oh I forgot"" Tanya said instantly falling over. Rue picked her up and carried her over to the wall. ""It's a storm outside"" Rue said looking up at the ceiling. ""How do you know?"" Tanya asked her eyes half closed. ""The winds more energetic"" Rue pointed out it seemed to him that everyone was suppose to know these things. ""Well then we won't be leaving here for awhile"" Tanya said closing her eyes and instantly falling asleep.

Stephanie stared up at the great blue dragon Fuyuko. The dragon looked down at her grabbed her in its long clawed hands and swam away.

Kyoi woke up slowly and moaned then he noticed he was in a bed. ""What the."" ""We had to buy a hotel room it started pouring outside."" Natasha said as lightning struck outside the window. Kyoi looked around the room and noticed Adam lying in the bed beside him still unconscious. ""What happened to him and the rest of the group?"" Kyoi asked. Natasha looked nervous as she answered, ""Well we found Adam bleeding on the beach unconscious when Diar did his light thing, we still haven't found Tanya, Rue or Stephanie. I'm very worried."" Natasha started to pace around the room every once in awhile looking out the window. A single bolt of lightning hit near the house then it all went black.
Chapter 7: Reunited
Kyoi looked around for any source of light and found a candle and matches. He lit the candle and put it in the middle of the circle they had made. ""Well what can we do to pass the time?"" Meaghan asked looking at everyone's faces that looked gaunt and evil in the dim light. ""We could play truth or dare!"" Diar said smiling. Kyoi growled and looked away. ""What? We can find out a lot in truth or dare!"" Diar yelled making the flame quiver. ""Fine"" Kyoi glared at Diar mouthing words that nobody wanted to think about. ""Okay I'll go first since it was my idea! Meaghan truth or dare!"" Diar was so happy at that moment he could have lit up the whole room if it were possible. ""Um.Truth"" Meaghan said looking at his happy face that looked insane in the firelight. ""Do you think I'm sexy?"" Diar asked leaning closer to her. ""Um.yeah a bit"" Meaghan replied inching away. ""Okay Natasha truth or dare?"" Meaghan asked flicking her hair out of her face. ""Truth"" Natasha said bluntly. ""Okay, do you like Kyoi in anyway?"" Meaghan asked now paying full attention to Natasha. ""Maybe a little"" Natasha said blushing. Kyoi looked at her and smirked but it couldn't be seen in the dim light. ""Okay, then Kyoi truth or dare?"" Natasha asked turning to him. ""Dare"" Kyoi didn't even have to think. ""Um go kiss Adam!"" Natasha said pointing to the unconscious Adam in bed. Kyoi stood up and walked over to Adam's bed ""On the lips or cheek?"" Kyoi asked glancing back to the circle. ""Lips!"" They all chanted. Kyoi bent forward and kissed Adam on the lips. Adam opened his eyes and would have screamed if Kyoi's lips weren't on his mouth. Kyoi broke the kiss then went back to the circle to sit down. ""What the hell was that about?"" Adam said walking to the circle then sitting down wishing he could spit.

Tanya woke up and looked around for her pillow finding none she opened her eyes. ""You nearly poked me in the eye"" Rue said looking down at her. ""Ah, sorry about that."" Tanya said leaning into Rue. ""No problem"" Rue looked into her hazel eyes and started leaning closer to her. ""You okay?"" Tanya asked looking up at his face. His eyes had turned black but had gone back to green. ""What?"" Rue asked looking around. ""Never mind."" Tanya looked at the water. ""Is the storm over yet?"" Tanya asked rubbing her hair. ""No it's turning violent"" Rue said leaning against the wall. ""Damn."" Tanya put her hand through the water watching it ripple.

Stephanie had been put in an air bubble that Fuyuko had made. The nest was full of thousands of dragon eggs. 'Well maybe I can get back to the others'. Stephanie looked up to the surface and saw lightning strike over the water 'maybe not'.

Cran walked into the big, dark floating castle down a black carpet. The carpet was covered with black rose petals and giant black pillars held up the ceiling. Cran walked up to two dark figures sitting in finely crafted chairs and bowed. ""You have failed me!"" The figure on the right side said. ""It was a miscalculation Lord Shadow, it will not happen again"" Cran was still on the ground in a bowing position. ""You better hope for your life is on the line"" Lord Shadow stood up and walked into a bit of light. He had long black hair and red eyes. His face was completely scar less and all his clothes were black. He was unpleasantly tall. ""One question who is that idiot?"" Shadow said pointing to Brock doing flips around the hall yelling, ""Dude, look at me!"" ""Well, he was annoying so I killed him that didn't seem to help."" Cran said a strange look on his face. ""He may come in handy"" Shadow turned around and headed back to his chair, ""Keep him with you."" Cran looked at Shadow and bowed. He walked out of the hall muttering how he had to take an idiot along with him. ""Dude, I'm a daisy!"" Brock yelled running around Cran. Cran just shook his head and growled.

""So why did you kiss me?"" Adam said eyeing Kyoi up. ""It's a dare you moron"" Kyoi said growling, ""That reminds me its my turn, Diar truth or dare?"" ""Dare!"" Diar yelled getting to his feet. ""I dare you to kiss Meaghan"" Kyoi said bluntly. Diar smiled and kissed Meaghan on the lips. He sat back down and looked at Adam. ""Adam truth or dare?"" Diar asked raising a finger. ""Well Dare I guess."" Adam said scratching his head. ""Well spin on your head!"" Diar jumped around happier then ever. ""Okay."" Adam got on his hands and knees then started to go on his head and spin. He stopped spinning and ran to the bathroom looking green. ""Maybe I shouldn't have dared that."" Diar said scratching his head, ""well I guess I'll go again.Natasha truth or dare?"" ""Dare"" Natasha smiled and awaited the dare. ""Poke yourself in the eye!"" Diar seemed to be floating in the air by this point. Natasha nodded slowly then poked herself in the eye ""Ouch."" ""Well I guess it's my turn Kyoi truth or dare?"" Natasha asked rubbing her eye. ""Truth,"" Kyoi said very calmly. ""Tell us about your past,"" Natasha said looking at him carefully. ""Well, my mom died when I was around 13 my dad I never knew but, my mom always told me to never say his name. She told me never to mention him. She cursed him every night and one night she died, I was in her room and I didn't even know how I got there. Those were my good days after that I became evil and killed and tortured."" Kyoi looked around the circle at the stunned faces and shrugged.

Tanya walked around the little cave thinking of how they could get out of there without another frog attack. ""Will you stop pacing and sit down"" Rue said his eye twitching. ""And what are we going to do?"" Tanya asked looking down at him. ""Whatever you want."" Rue said looking up. ""Whatever eh?"" Tanya said smiling. ""Yeah anything"" Rue smirked. Tanya sat down in front of him and leaned about in inch from his lips. ""Let's sing!"" Tanya yelled making Rue fall over. ""What should we sing.""? Rue mumbled a little sad he had thought for one second that she might just have.. 99 bottles of beer on the wall 99 bottles of beer take one down pass it around 98 bottles of beer on the wall. 98 bottles of beer on the wall 98 bottles of beer take one down pass it around 97 bottles of beer on the wall. 97 bottles of beer on the wall 97 bottles of beer take one down pass it around 96 bottles of beer on the wall. 96 bottles of beer on the wall 96 bottles of beer take one down pass it around 95 bottles of beer on the wall. 95 bottles of beer on the wall 95 bottles of beer take one down pass it around 94 bottles of beer on the wall..

A half an hour later..

""That was unexpected."" Rue said staring at Tanya. ""Well it was fun and now I wanna sleep"" Tanya walked over to Rue and sat down on his lap. ""Do you mind?"" Tanya asked with a smile. ""Not at all"" Rue said closing his eyes.

Stephanie looked around everywhere for somewhere to go. She looked up at Fuyuko then got an idea. 'Maybe if I ask her for help.' The dragon looked at Stephanie with its huge yellow eyes. ""Will you help me get back to my friends?"" Stephanie asked unsure of what she was doing. The dragon glanced at her then went to the surface with lightning quick speed. Fuyuko emerged on the surface and gave a sickening shriek that could probably be heard for miles.

Cran walked out of the castle and came to one of his black frogs. He smiled and climbed onto his biggest one. ""Dude, can I ride a worm?"" Brock asked looking happy. ""Um.no"" Cran looked down at him and frowned 'what a dumb ass'. ""Dude, you get to ride a frog why can't I ride a giant worm!"" Brock screamed stomping his feet on the ground. ""You ride with me,"" Cran said running his hand through his shoulder length black hair. Brock climbed on the frog and smiled ""Giddy up Froggy!"" he yelled at the top of his lungs. Cran just frowned and punched him in the stomach. ""Shut up!""

Kyoi stood up hearing the screech from a dragon. He ran to the balcony and swung open the doors stepping to the edge, ignoring the lightning. ""That's Stephanie's dragon, that shriek is probably a sign of where she is"" Kyoi stood on the railing of the balcony and willed his wings to appear. He looked pretty damn fine like that. He took off leaving the rest of the group standing there. ""What the hell? Is he just going to leave us here?!"" yelled Meaghan. Natasha stood on the railing and tried to force out wings and to her surprise it worked, ""Cool."" She took off with her brownish green wings supporting her through the air, made of an earthen material. Meaghan shrugged and did the same except heavy, gray, stone, wings appeared for her. She growled and jumped off the balcony nearly falling to the ground. Meaghan managed to fly back up. Diar jumped after Meaghan angel like, white wings appearing from his back. He easily caught up with Meaghan and then Natasha since he had used wings before. ""That's so not fair!"" Natasha yelled at him. Adam was the last to take off very bright wings with lightning encircling them appeared from his back. Every time lightning lit the sky his wings grew and he flew much faster, soon he had passed Kyoi
Kyoi tried to pass Adam but it didn't seem like he could ""Damn you Adam!"" Kyoi swore at him a few more times. They finally came to a huge dragon and saw Stephanie at the surface waving ""Hi guys!"" They flew down to her and smiled ""We have finally found you! Is Tanya and Rue with you?"" Natasha asked. ""No I don't know where they are,"" replied Stephanie suddenly going nervous. ""Damn I hope there alright"" Natasha suddenly looked to the water in concern.

Rue suddenly opened his eyes and woke up Tanya. ""We should go the others are flying towards Stephanie,"" Rue said getting up and jumping into the water. ""You knew this the whole time!"" Tanya yelled at him jumping in the water too. ""Yeah, I just thought it would be fun in a cave with you."" Rue dove down and started to head for the surface of the water. ""Fuck!"" Tanya dived down after him. They emerged on the surface and Rue started to float feet above. ""Come on! Form your wings!"" Rue ushered her. ""How?"" Tanya asked looking up at him. ""Just do it I know you can!"" Rue yelled getting impatient. Tanya willed herself to get wings and she flew out of the water fire sprouting from her back. ""Race you!"" Tanya flew into the air towards the group. Rue smirked then quickly caught up with her. They got to the group and all of them looked sad. ""Why the glum faces?"" Tanya asked smiling. Natasha looked up at Tanya and smiled, she flew up to Tanya and gave her a big hug, avoiding the flames. ""Well let's get going to our next destination, Thunder Valley."" Rue said urging them all to Dair who had already opened the portal. Stephanie made wings that looked like fins and flew up into the portal.

Cran appeared in that exact place a second later. Fuyuko glared down at him and slashed at him knocking Brock off the frog. Fuyuko made one accurate swipe and killed the frog blood filling the originally blue water. Cran jumped up and disappeared with Brock.
Chapter 8: Tsu in Thunder Valley
Tanya walked out of the portal and looked around. It just happened to be a lightning storm here too 'just great'. She shivered and looked around at the group ""Does anyone have any proper clothes?"" Rue looked at her and rummaged through one of the many bags. He pulled out a big, black sweatshirt and baggy black pants. ""Sorry that's all we got"" Rue said handing it to her. Tanya walked away scowling, looking down at the men's clothes. 'Not even a single pair of women clothes do they have the decency!' She changed quickly then went back to the group Rue and Stephanie had changed too. ""Well where in Thunder Valley is my dragon?"" Adam asked looking through the rain. ""Anywhere"" Rue said walking down the slope. Tanya started to cough and shiver the clothes weren't helping in the rain. Rue looked back at her and walked back to pick her up. ""Hey guys you think there's a hotel near here Tanya's getting a bit of a fever?"" Rue asked checking her temperature. ""There should be,"" Kyoi said walking off to look for one. Rue sat down and covered her as best he could; her breathing had become harsher. ""Great."" Rue said listening to her breathing.

Natasha looked at Tanya who was hidden by Rue's arms, only a bit of her visible. He cares for her an awful lot. Kyoi came back shrugging ""nothing."" Rue frowned and looked back down at Tanya. ""Did you find anything?"" Rue asked. ""I found a hot spring but I'm not sure the girls would like us there."" Kyoi said smiling a bit. They all looked at Natasha who had a big smile on her face. ""What are you smiling at?"" Kyoi asked smiling at her happy face. ""Ah.nothing."" Natasha said looking away. Diar walked up to her with a smile and said in a whisper ""I bet your thinking of 'him'."" Natasha looked at him and frowned ""I was thinking of something.not 'him'."" ""So, anyway would you girls mind if we stuck around when your in the hot spring, we don't want to catch a cold too,"" Kyoi said smirking yet again. ""What's the next request its cold out here can we go in with you?"" Meaghan said sarcastically. ""Now that your offering that would be nice"" Kyoi's smirk became bigger. ""I never offered anything!"" Meaghan yelled at Kyoi. Kyoi walked away to the hot spring everyone following ""Yes you did."" ""Look at the mess I got us into"" Meaghan said looking back at the frowning girls. ""Thanks Meaghan,"" they said sarcastically.

They finally got to the hot spring that was located in a small overhang in the valley. ""Convenient"" Rue said looking at the hot spring. ""Get in girls"" Diar said happily knowing Kyoi had won the argument. ""Turn around you perverts!"" Meaghan yelled looking at them all except for Rue staring at them. ""Fine it's only fair,"" Kyoi said turning around ""since you did offer for us to join you."" Meaghan growled and started to undress when they were done and Tanya was in with them. The guys turned around ""now you girls turn around"" Kyoi smirked taking off his shirt. They did as instructed then waited for the ready. It took a surprising long time and there was a lot of 'dude that's wrong' from Diar. They finally were in and the girls were aloud to turn around. Before turning around they sunk lower into the water then got the guts to turn around. Diar had the biggest smile he had ever had on his face, it was wrong.

Cran stared at the group walk to a new location. He noticed they were heading straight for a hot spring. An argument began between a brunette and a black haired guy in the group. When the girls began to get undressed Cran turned around to Brock who was dancing around in circles singing Jimmy crack corn and I don't care. Cran looked disgusted then turned back to the group. The girls had gotten in and were turned around the guys were undressing. Cran turned around once again in disgust but Brock had rushed up to watch. Cran frowned 'why did my partner have to be a gay?' When Brock started dancing again Cran knew it was all right to look around. They were in a heated talk about something but Cran couldn't hear it 'Damn'.

Kyoi heard a rumble and immediately stood up. ""Warn us next time!"" Meaghan yelled at him a blush across her face. Kyoi growled and snapped his fingers he was immediately wearing clothes. Kyoi got up and fell back down from the shaking in the ground ""What the hell is that!?"" Kyoi yelled. Adam and the rest of the guys got up and snapped their fingers clothes appearing on them as well. The girls stood up and did the same Tanya who was feeling better was able to do it. Tanya still couldn't walk that well (it's like the drunk walk!) Rue looked back at her and picked her up ""I don't like this at all."" Rue started walking when the ground trembled again. Natasha glared down at the ground ""Whatever this is I don't like it."" Of course Natasha would care for the Earth and this was a real disturbance. A big yellow eye could be seen through the rain. ""Is that my dragon!""? Adam yelled in excitement. ""Well I don't like it it's hurting the Earth."" Natasha said glaring at the eye. ""Now I remember! Of course Tsu, yes Adam this is your dragon"" Rue said smiling. ""That's why the earth was shaking it felt like thunder."" Tsu stepped forward; Tsu had no wings but instead was covered with brownish yellow scales. On the sides of its long muscular legs were claws that looked terribly sharp.



Cran got one of his large frogs and jumped down not noticing the dragon. ""Now you will die!"" Cran yelled looking down at them. Adam just smiled and laughed, ""Like that's going to happen."" Cran heard a growl and turned around just in time to see his frog be torn into a thousand pieces by the long claws of the dragon. ""Damnit!"" He yelled disappearing.



Adam ran over to Tsu and bowed; Tsu just bowed his neck, which was very long. Adam felt his scaly hide then turned back to the gang ""Let's leave like the lightning"" he said smiling. They smiled too and opened up there portals forgetting their luggage.
Chapter 9: Chikyuu Dragon of Earth
Natasha stepped out of the portal and looked around at the surroundings. They were on the edge of a forest, mountains in the background with snow-covered peaks, and water could be heard. The second thing she noticed was that it was around midnight since the quarter moon was high in the sky. That's when she finally felt tired. ""Guys why don't we go to bed"" Natasha turned around yawning. ""That sounds like a good idea"" Stephanie said turning around looking for the bags. ""Um.where are the bags?"" Stephanie asked only seeing grass. ""Oh, shit I think we left them behind"" Rue said looking where the bags went as well. ""Don't worry guys I always have something"" Tanya took out a huge bag and looked through it. ""Where did she get that bag?"" Adam asked Rue. ""Who knows."" Rue said observing what she was doing closely. ""Uh oh we only have five"" Tanya said taking out five sleeping bags. ""Rock paper scissors!"" Diar yelled putting a fist into the air. They all nodded and went in a circle. Adam and Stephanie happened to win and got their own sleeping bags. ""Now to think who gets the rest we'll have to double up,"" Diar said smiling. It's almost like he wanted to lose. ""Well Rue and Tanya can sleep together since we know there already acquainted. I mean they were in a cave alone and we know they slept together"" Natasha said giving them a sleeping bag. Both of them were blushing a lot. ""Anyway what did you guys do in that cave?"" Natasha asked going back over to the sleeping bags. ""Tanya slept and we sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall"" Rue said and from what everyone knew Rue never lied. Everyone looked at Rue in a strange way 'you'd think they'd be making out or something'. ""Well I guess me and Meaghan will share one and Kyoi and Diar will share one as well"" Natasha said grabbing one. ""WHAT?!"" Kyoi and Tanya yelled. ""There's no way in hell I'd sleep with this kid!"" Kyoi yelled stepping forward. ""Since I'm sleeping with Rue each of you girls have to sleep with a boy"" Tanya said smiling a bit. Natasha sighed and went over to Kyoi ""Fine, fine."" ""What! You leave me with him!"" Meaghan yelled while Diar went over to grab the last sleeping bag. ""Yeah"" the whole group said going through Tanya's bag for clothes that they could wear.

When they were all in their pajamas except for Diar and Meaghan who were arguing about the sleeping bag dress code. ""But I always sleep naked!"" Diar looked at her pleadingly. ""Then for one night in your life you're going to wear some pants!"" Meaghan yelled at him. ""Get the fuck to sleep"" Kyoi mumbled feeling really tired. They finally decided to change and go to bed after Rue stood up and yelled at them. Stephanie and Adam looked really smug in their sleeping bags while, Diar was trying to cuddle with Meaghan he was failing miserably. Kyoi and Natasha were as far apart as possible for a one-person sleeping bag. Rue and Tanya were doing like they always were I guess you could call it cuddling without them noticing. After awhile everyone drifted off to sleep.




Well it was completely different in the morning for the people who had to share anyway. Diar had put his arms around Meaghan who was now facing him there faces inches apart. Natasha and Kyoi had gotten much closer, Natasha had turned over and looked like her legs were on top of Kyoi's and Kyoi had his arms around Natasha. For Tanya and Rue they had gotten closer impossibly, Tanya's head was resting on Rue's chest and Rue was leaning against her head. Would everyone be in for a surprise when they woke up. Stephanie woke up and looked over at the pairs and giggled it was so cute. She woke up Adam and they both searched through Tanya's bag for food and cooking materials. Since it was Stephanie who was cooking they were in for a big meal and since they hadn't eaten in a while it would be good for them. ""Who do you think will start making out as soon as they wake up?"" Adam asked looking at Stephanie. ""I bet you 10 bucks it's Diar and Meaghan"" Stephanie said smiling but still concentrating on the eggs. ""I don't know but I'll take your bet I bet 10 bucks on Rue and Tanya"" Adam said they both shook hands. As soon as Diar woke up he smiled his work in the night worked they hadn't moved that much maybe closer which was good. Meaghan opened her eyes and saw Diar right in her face she screamed and jumped out of the sleeping bag. Stephanie sighed looking down at her 10 bucks. Adam had a smile on his face looking at Meaghan walk away and Diar frown. ""You know they still have to make out,"" Stephanie said smiling. This wiped the smile off of Adam's face ""Don't ruin my dreams of 10 extra bucks."" Natasha woke up and blushed a little but got up which made Kyoi wake up. They didn't seem to mind at all. ""Thank god we didn't bet on them,"" Adam said to Stephanie who nodded. Kyoi walked into the forest and Natasha, Diar, and Meaghan joined the cooking circle. ""They really needed some sleep,"" Natasha said pointing to the still sleeping figures of Rue and Tanya. ""Do you think they did anything in that cave?"" Meaghan asked looking at the pair. ""No, Rue doesn't lie. He might just be awake and smelling her hair"" Diar said smiling and wishing Meaghan would have done the same. Kyoi came back a few minutes later and sat down.

""Where were you?"" Diar asked looking at Kyoi curiously. ""Can I get a seconds privacy?"" Kyoi asked looking at Diar. ""I was just curious now I can make up my own story"" Diar said getting a big smile on his face. Kyoi looked at him in a disgusted sort of way ""I was going to the washroom."" ""You ruined my fun!"" Diar yelled his smile gone. Kyoi looked down at the ten bucks and then to Adam and Stephanie who were looking over to the sleeping pair. ""What's the ten bucks for?"" Kyoi asked looking at them curiously. ""If they don't make out then we both get to keep our ten bucks if they do I owe Adam ten bucks"" Stephanie said still looking. Rue's eyes slowly opened thinking everyone was still asleep he kissed Tanya on the forehead. Tanya slowly opened her eyes and looked at Rue. ""What"" she asked sleepily. Rue smiled and put his soft lips on hers. Tanya stared wide-eyed at him then finally closed her eyes. She wrapped her arms around his neck and Rue deepened the kiss granted entrance he explored the insides of her mouth. Finally opening one eye he noticed everyone staring at them 'oh shit'. He broke the kiss immediately standing up and walking over to the circle. They were staring at him and every movement then Adam broke the silence. ""I think this is mine"" he took the ten bucks and smiled. ""Damn"" Stephanie said passing around food. Tanya sat down beside Rue and smiled at all the faces in the group. They slowly ate but it was very filling. Breakfast contained: eggs, bacon, orange juice, toast with jam, bagels for people who wanted them and some other stuff.

Cran looked at them from a tall tree in the forest. 'That looked like fun'. He had taken an interest in the blonde female but he couldn't have her since his Master also wanted her. He didn't know what his master had planned for these people but it was going to be fun. Brock was doing his small dance on the branch until he was hit on the head by a bigger branch swung by Cran. There was a sickening crack as Brock hit the ground but the group didn't hear it since they were laughing about something. Cran glared at the guy with the blonde hair then disappeared from the tree branch.

They had finished breakfast and were packed in a flash thanks to Rue. ""So where are we going to find a dragon in something that big?"" Natasha asked pointing to the forest. ""It'll come when it wants to"" Rue said starting to walk. ""Great"" Natasha said following him. The whole group followed Rue and looked at all the trees for any sign of a giant dragon. Something moved under the ground and launched Meaghan into the air. ""Meaghan!"" Diar yelled and ran to catch her. A humanoid made of dirt came out of the ground with roots bursting out around it. It seemed to be female (SEEMED). It smiled as a root flew up and struck Natasha on the face blood from her cheek spilling onto the ground. Natasha raised her hands and the Earth began to tremble and soon the humanoid fell apart. Natasha smiled and lowered her hands but slowly the humanoid regained shape and gave a wicked smile. Natasha's eyes widened and she looked around for anything that could defeat a bunch of soil. She looked over at Meaghan and got an idea 'that's why it attacked Meaghan!' ""Meaghan get up and turn this thing into stone!"" Natasha yelled at her. The humanoid frowned and headed for Natasha who both now were in hand-to-hand combat. The dirt punches hurt much more then Natasha's punches. Meaghan finally got up and glared at the humanoid. Slowly it turned to stone crumbling to a soft ruble. ""Thank god"" Natasha said wiping blood from the corner of her mouth.

They walked deeper now looking for enemies but not finding any. Natasha heard a low growl and the ground started to move knocking most of the group off their feet. Natasha stared into the darkness smiling at the yellow eyes that greeted her. When the dragon walked more into the light she noticed the brown scales and how long it was. The wings were scrunched up and had little holes in them. The tail and neck were exceptionally long and the spikes looked very dangerous but other then that the dragon looked friendly. It growled again in the same low tone. Natasha walked up to it and rubbed its long muzzle. ""Hello Chikyuu"" Natasha said in a whisper. This act earned a low rumble in the dragon's throat. Natasha turned back to the group who were all smiling. ""I just thought of something"" Rue said to Tanya ""Tomorrow will be your last night of transformation."" Tanya looked up at him and grabbed his arm in embrace. ""Cool,"" Tanya said leaning against him.

Natasha headed back to the group and took one last look at Chikyuu. ""See you Chikyuu"" Natasha waved and headed for the portal. ""Wait where are we going?"" Natasha asked Rue who was waiting for her. ""Estonia,"" he said with a big smile, ""we can sleep in a bed."" Natasha looked at him and shook her head then walked into the portal. Rue looked up at the sky and thought he saw a face through the trees but shrugged it off. He walked into the portal not wanting to think of anything bad.

Lord Shadow looked at the figure beside him and smiled his devious smile. ""Suko how is the plan going"" Shadow smiled at the women which had moved to look at him catching the light. She had long black hair and completely black eyes. She wore a robe of pure black that flowed when she moved. ""It is going good my lord your plan will soon be in motion. He smirked and sat back down looking at the giant black hall. 'Excellent.'
Chapter 10: Relations
Tanya stepped out of the portal and looked at her surroundings. She noticed a sign that said Amsterdam and smirked but then frowned. ""Rue weren't we supposed to be going to Estonia?"" Tanya asked looking at him. ""Yeah, I think someone screwed up the portal"" Rue had a flashback of the guy with the red eyes and frowned 'him'. ""Let's just go back into the portal and go to Estonia"" Diar said shrugging. ""No that won't work Kyoi analyze the strength of the spell around the portals"" Rue commanded looking over at Kyoi. Kyoi nodded and closed his eyes focusing on the portals. ""It's pretty strong could last around two to three days"" Kyoi said knowing Rue's train of thought. ""Damn!"" Rue said now pacing. ""Guys don't worry I'm 75 percent Dutch I have relatives here"" Tanya said smiling ""I'm sure they'd be happy to let us stay with them."" Rue just stared at her then smiled ""Thank god.""

""Where do your cousins live?"" Rue asked they had been walking for about an hour now. ""I'm trying to figure that out,"" Tanya said looking at every corner and street sign. ""What you don't know?"" Kyoi said walking beside her. ""It's not like I'm here everyday!"" Tanya yelled noticing a familiar supermarket. ""Wait!"" she yelled running to the automatic doors. ""I know this!"" Tanya ran down the street the rest of them struggling to keep up. They finally came to a street made of bricks and Tanya looked down a thin path and said ""Bikers get the right of way."" Tanya then walked across the street making sure no cars were coming as well. They turned into a small seemingly deserted street and then Tanya noticed the same small blue car that could barely fit four people. Tanya knocked at the door and a blonde appeared at the door. She was fairly short and was in her forties. ""Taunta Jeanette!"" Tanya said hugging her. ""Tanya what a surprise! Why are you here without your mom? And who are your friends?"" Jeanette asked looking at the group. ""This may take awhile.can we come inside?"" Tanya asked looking at the tidy house. They sat on a black leather couch and some chairs from the table.

""First I'll start with introductions this is Natasha, Meaghan, Stephanie, Kyoi, Diar, Adam, and Rue"" Tanya pointed at every person along the row of chairs and the leather couches. ""Now for the hard part. A few weeks ago I found out I was a reincarnation of a warrior from a thousand years ago and so are my friends so now were on a journey to rid the word of a new evil. That pretty much sums it up."" Tanya said looking at her aunt. ""Well that's a lot to take in.I think I can make room for you and your friends."" Jeanette said standing up ""Show your friends the house if you want."" Tanya stood up and smiled ""time to check out where were staying!"" Rue stood up and the rest followed they came to a door parallel to the front door. ""This is the bathroom just for the toilet, over there's the kitchen"" Tanya said pointing down the hall put then running up the small spiral staircase. ""Okay now this is where you take your bath that is my cousin Tom's room, that's my aunt and uncle's room, that on the other side of the hall is Lar's room, and last but not least up that red ladder in the middle of the hall is Niel's room."" Tanya said pointing from left to right. ""Now the simple matter of where were going to sleep"" Tanya said then looked down the stairs when she heard the door opening. ""Sewer Turtle!"" Tanya yelled running down the stairs and hugging her cousin. ""Marshland Shrew!"" He yelled as well hugging her back. Rue looked down the stairs and a growl formed in his throat. ""Rue calm down it's only her cousin"" Natasha said patting him on the shoulder. 'God so damn protective Rue was of Tanya'.

Tanya disappeared for a second but returned a few minutes later. ""Okay here's how the sleeping arrangement is going to go. My two older cousins are going to sleep over at their friend Dennis's house so all the girls will be sleeping in Tom's room since we can fit a mattress on the floor, but it will be very cramped. Kyoi and Rue will be sleeping in Niel's room. Diar and Adam will be sleeping downstairs on the leather couches."" Tanya said yawning, ""damn time change."" Lars brought a mattress upstairs into Tom's room and put covers on it, ""dinner will be ready soon."" Tanya smiled at him and went into his room to watch some television. ""Is that normal?"" Rue asked a clear growl in his voice. ""Yeah they did it all the time the last time she was here they closed the door,"" Natasha laughed seeing his expression. ""Dinner!"" Jeanette called to all the teens. They all walked down the stairs and smiled feeling there stomachs growling.

""Dude why don't we ever eat?"" Brock asked dancing on a room top. ""We don't need to eat you jackass,"" Cran said looking at the group walk into the dinning room. Everyone in Holland leaves there blinds open. Cran smiled when he saw the blonde teen step into the room. Tanya's glance slowly went up to the rooftops noticing him and she stopped. 'Shit!'

Tanya walked into the room and looked at the surroundings of the dark sky outside. That's when she saw the figure staring at her from a rooftop smirking in his own malicious way. Tanya stopped instantly looking at the red eyes. Tanya ran out the door ignoring all the shouts of where she was going. Cran smirked and jumped down from his rooftop. ""You know your just throwing yourself at my feet?"" He asked his smirk widening. ""What do you mean?"" Tanya asked stepping cautiously forward. ""Well if I told you it would ruin everything"" Cran stepped forward quicker and grabbed both of her wrists tightly. ""Get off of me"" Tanya snarled at Cran. ""It's best you know my name, I am Cran I serve the dark ruler Shadow."" Cran said proudly. ""Wow.you should win the noble peace prize,"" Tanya said sarcastically. Cran smirked and lowered his lips to hers. ""Yes I think I should"" Cran said before closing the remaining gap. He bit her lower lip fighting for entrance, he bit so hard blood dripped out and Tanya opened her mouth in pain. 'Good' he slipped his tongue in her mouth exploring the contents. His hold on her was so strong she couldn't seem to escape. Rue finally got concerned and ran out the door everyone had said that there was nothing wrong but something told him there was.

Rue looking around in the darkness saw the sight a few houses pasted. He gasped then noticed that Tanya was struggling to get away that just made him pissed real pissed. Winds rippled the air causing huge disturbances everywhere. Cran had pulled away and looked at the blonde man he hated so much. Rue lashed everything causing trees to be cut by the force, cars flung over. Tanya looked at him in a thankful sort of way when a gust of wind encircled her bringing her closer to him without harm. ""Why didn't you tell me?"" Rue growled even slightly mad at Tanya. ""I was curious."" Tanya looked at the ground. ""Never do that again,"" Rue snarled looking back at her. ""I have my own life"" Tanya said glaring. ""I don't want to lose you again"" Rue said his voice finally going calm but going angry again when he faced Cran. The wind picked up even more if it was possible knocking Brock off the roof. Cran just stood there smirking at Rue. ""Do you think your pitiful powers will work on me?"" Cran asked crossing his arms his black hair playing in the wind. Rue growled and the wind increased ten fold. The wind was so powerful now that Cran's skin was slicing open in numerous areas. Blood now dripped onto the grass by Cran's gushing wounds. ""How dare you!"" Cran said before disappearing.

Rue rounded on Tanya looking down at her with his green eyes. He picked her up and made him face her. He put his forefingers on the edge of her lips, which made her quiver. He slowly parted them and looked at the dried blood and the forming bruise. He sighed and carried her inside. ""Rue put me down,"" Tanya commanded looking into his face. ""No I'm never letting you go again"" Rue said a note of anger in his voice. ""Let's make a promise then,"" Tanya said trying to pry herself out of Rue's arms ""I'll always tell you when something is wrong from now on okay, we'll always be there for each other."" He looked down at her and nodded ""That's sensible, now let's eat"" Rue put her down and headed to the table.

After their dinner of fries, and some other stuff they went to bed obvious of the time difference. ""There's not room in these beds for four people"" Meaghan said surveying the beds. ""There's room on the floor Meaghan"" Natasha said smirking. She had already changed and occupied a bed. Stephanie had done the same thing with the other bed. ""Fine"" Meaghan put up her hands in defeat. Tanya walked over to the single bed where Natasha was sleeping and sat down. ""I'm not going to ask what happened since you showed me good evidence already, but right now lets get to sleep"" Natasha said laying her head down on the pillow, Tanya did the same.

Rue looked up at the glass in the ceiling frowning. 'That son of a bitch I'll kill him'. ""Rue go to sleep"" Kyoi said looking at him. Rue looked over at Kyoi 'he used to be my enemy now he's my best friend, maybe.' ""Rue!"" Kyoi said shaking the much older guy. ""What?"" Rue finally said snapping out of his thoughts. ""Go to sleep and worry about the evil dumb ass tomorrow"" Kyoi said leaning his head back on the pillow. 'Kyoi's right it was just a kiss, Kyoi did much worse. but why do I feel so worried inside?'

""Why does everyone else get beds and we have to sleep on sofas!"" Diar yelled pulling the blankets over him. ""Cause we were last to pick"" Adam said smiling. ""It's not far I need pampered sleeps to keep my figure in good shape"" Diar wined. ""Diar I don't think your 'perfect body' is going to change in one night"" Adam said closing his eyes. ""What if it does?"" Diar said nervously. ""Trust me it won't"" Adam said his smile growing bigger. ""Okay"" Diar confirmed finally putting his head down on the pillow.

Cran looked at the cuts all over his arms, legs, and face. He put his index finger on the long one on his face and watched it close slowly and painfully. 'Damn him he ruined my fun'. He did the same to all his other cuts and watched them heal thinking. He rubbed his hand through his long strands of hair and looked at his red eyes. ""They didn't always use to be this colour but I like it this way'. Cran smirked and headed to a completely black bed that he climbed into a fell asleep.

Natasha woke up to find that she was sleeping alone ""Tanya?"" she asked looking around then noticing her change. She had grown several inches her feet going to the end of the long bed. Her nails had grown and muscles had formed on her stomach 'cool'. ""What?"" Tanya groaned feeling her stomach. Natasha looked off the bed and noticed Tanya on the floor. Tanya seemed to have also grown and grow muscles. Tanya got up and headed for the door opening it she saw Rue sitting on the railing. ""What?"" Tanya asked rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. He stood up and walked over to her spreading her lips apart the blood and bruise had disappeared. ""Good"" he smirked looking down at her. ""How was he?"" Rue asked an amused smile on his face. ""Huh?"" Tanya asked looking at him and yawning. Rue moved closer and bent forward to kiss her on the lips. Spreading her lips apart easily he explored all the areas of her mouth his hand unnoticeable going through her hair. He broke away lost for breath; regaining it he said, ""So who was better?"" Tanya smiled and put her long index finger on his chest ""I think you know the answer to that yourself"" Tanya said walking away. Rue smirked and turned to follow her.

""So what's planned for today?"" Diar asked scratching his back. Lars came into the room and looked at Rue. ""Is he Mike?"" Lars asked Tanya had never introduced him to her friends. ""Mike?"" Rue asked rising in eyebrow. ""Well no he's not Mike, and Mike was an old school crush."" Tanya replied, ""Now for introductions this is Natasha, Stephanie, Meaghan, Dair, Adam, Kyoi, and Rue."" ""Now I think were going to go shopping today for cool Dutch stuff!"" Tanya said her hand going into the air. They all looked at her then happily nodded.

They headed down the street looking at the old antique shops and all the interesting stuff until they came to the mall they were suppose to be going to. It had plastic fish and sea life hanging off the ceiling. Tanya went into a clothing shop called 'Cool Cats' and came out a few minutes later her bag full of women's clothes. ""Damn what did you buy?"" Rue asked smiling. ""You'll like it all"" Tanya replied. They came to an interesting store kind of like bad manners. Offensive stuff in Dutch and crap like that. Meaghan saw this amazing little revolving thing that my mom saw years ago I loved that thing. It was around twelve that they stopped for lunch. They sat down and ordered some fries (Dutch specialty). ""Kyoi do you know anything about a guy named Lord Shadow?"" Tanya asked drinking her pop. ""Shadow. I might let's see is there anything else you know about him?"" Kyoi asked looking at her curiously. ""Well all I know is that Cran works for him"" Tanya shrugged. ""Who?"" Diar asked drinking his Heineken beer. ""That guy with the black hair last night"" Tanya frowned looking at Rue's strange look. ""I don't know anything about a guy named Shadow"" Kyoi said eating some of his fries. ""Great."" Tanya said sarcastically.

Night had come quickly since it was always usually dark in Holland. The group had gone to sleep exhaustion taking over them all. At around midnight Kyoi opened his eyes feeling a familiar power in the distance. He opened up the window jumped out, and extended his dark black wings. And he flew away..</lj-cut>"

<lj-cut text=""Dragon Samurai Chapters 1-5"">Chapter 1:Reborn through time 
~*~ I opened up my eyes, the first thing I did was look at my surroundings. I was sitting in a field with long grass that swayed with the wind. That's when I noticed my clothes I was wearing a white cape with black lining, white robes underneath. I felt safe in this place yet I had no idea where I was. The wind almost sounded like a whisper it sounded so familiar yet I couldn't point it out. The sky suddenly went black and the ground broke apart under me causing me to fall. ~*~

Tanya woke up with a start; it was still dark outside the only light was from the full moon that came through the blinds. Tanya flicked on the lights and tried to remember what happened in her dream. ""Damn it I lost it, It was probably important to"" she whispered. Tanya got out of bed and looked in her old fashioned mirror, which was lined with gold and white. Tanya had shoulder length dirty blonde hair, hazel eyes, not to many freckles, and smooth textured lips. She wore her favourite pajama's, which used to be her brother's. It was a gray Nike that had many holes in it. She also wore her shorts, which she had since grades two. They were black and ripped; they looked more like rags then shorts. Tanya yawned and crawled back into her canopy bed. The white mesh fabric swished with the flow from the wind that was coming from the open window. She smiled as she saw the wind play with the fabric. She turned off the lights and was put back to sleep by a strange whispering sound.

Tanya awoke with a start; she immediately looked at the clock at the side of her room and gasped. It was already 8:30 she had slept in! She ran to her closet and pulled on her uniform. Her uniform consisted of: A black skirt and a white shirt with black lining. She quickly brushed her hair and ran downstairs, grabbed a banana, said bye to her parents and ran out the door. She arrived in her classroom one minute before the bell rang; Tanya sat down and brushed her hair back with her hand. I have got to stop waking up late it's getting annoying. Natasha stepped into the class and smiled to Tanya ""Hi."" She said. Natasha was a brunette that wore black and blue glasses. Her face was slightly tanned and she had hazel eyes. Natasha sat down beside Tanya and looked at her ""You thought you were late again?"" asked Natasha ""Exactly"" replied Tanya breathing heavily. Soon Meaghan and Stephanie had come into class. Meaghan was a brunette with slightly curly hair and beautiful blue eyes, and tanned skin. Stephanie had red hair, bluish red eyes and a whole lot of freckles. Meaghan sat on the other side of Natasha and Stephanie sat beside Tanya. After a few minutes the whole class piled in and then the teacher. It was then that Tanya noticed that there were a few extra seats in the class. ""I'm happy to say that there will be three new students to the class. Let's see Rue, Kyoi and Diar"" Mr. Fisert said with a smile. The three boys stepped in the room and smiled, well most of them smiled except for the last one with black hair he looked like he lost the ability to smile a long time ago. The first one was the tallest; he had blonde spiked hair with white streaks, and hazel yellow eyes. ""Hello my name is Rue,"" he said calmly as though he'd said it a million times. The second boy was the shortest of the three; he had black hair that was spiked back with orange goggles, and orange yellow eyes. ""Hiya, names Diar!"" he said happily waving to everyone. The last guy who was slightly shorter then Rue had long black hair that was put in a ponytail, and red eyes. ""Hi, Kyoi"" He said in a very bored voice. ""You may now take your seats boys sit wherever you want to sit"" Mr. Fisert motioned to the empty seats in the back of the classroom. Rue walked past Tanya and sat behind her, Diar took the seat behind Meaghan, and Kyoi took the seat behind Natasha.

The classes went on, and on not knowing when to stop. When the bell finally rang for recess the new guys were challenged to a game of football. They shrugged and smiled at the rest of the guys. ""Ok what are the teams?"" Diar asked with a shrug. ""Well how about."" Matt started but was cut off by Kyoi. ""How about us three and that guy with the brown hair against all of you"" Kyoi smirked while pointing to a guy with brown hair that was fairly tall named Adam. Matt started to laugh along with everyone else clutching his sides. Kyoi just smirked and got into a set position with the other three on his team. Matt got ready to punt the ball, a huge crowd had come around the football food cheering Matt's team and most of the girls were drooling over the three new guys. Tanya, Natasha, Meaghan, and Stephanie walked up to the football field and watched the game with mild curiosity. Matt had kicked the ball and Kyoi had jumped about a meter in the air to catch it. All the girls gasped and started to cheer for Kyoi, He ran so fast his body nearly touching the ground. He easily dodged everyone on Matt's team and scored an early lead, looking like it had been nothing at all. The teachers had joined the crowd watching the exciting game attentively. The bell rang and all the girls ran up to the three and goggled over there good looks and muscled bodies. Tanya just sighed and muttered something that oddly sounded like 'sluts.' Everyone headed to class many excited girls screaming things like 'SIGN MY SHIRT!' and a few other not so pleasant comments 'SIGN MY ASS!' that one would leave images.

The rest of the day was pretty uneventful except for a little fight that went on in science. ""You don't mike those to chemicals together you don't know what will happen!"" A blonde girl named Jill yelled to a reddish haired girl. ""I know what I'm doing Jill!"" Amber said mixing the two chemicals together. A loud bang was heard and when the dust cleared the girl's perfect hair was now covered in sticky gooey substance. The final bell rang and everyone grabbed there bags and headed out the front doors of the school. ""Hey guys want to go get something at Dairy Queen?"" Tanya asked the rest of the group. ""Yeah sure!"" The rest said in unison. ""Hello"" the three new guys approached us and gave us a smile. ""We've been keeping our eyes on you girls the whole day we want a chat with you, you're the only girls that resisted our irresistible hotness"" said Diar with a smile. Kyoi gave him an odd look then shrugged. The girls looked at each other then shrugged ""Yeah ok but you'll be paying for us all"" Meaghan said with a smile. The groups headed to Dairy Queen and ordered their different things.

A small talk went on about what each of them liked then Rue's voice went serious. ""We didn't come with you to tell you about our 'incredible hotness' we came because we've been searching for awhile for four girls and a guy named Niaka, Naria, Tara, Souppi, and Numaka. They were close friends of ours along time ago and we want to meet them again. In truth Kyoi and Diar are resurrections of two ancient warriors called the Kurai Samurai, I am one as well but, I am immortal because my good friend Niaka sacrificed herself to save me."" Rue said a tear silently falling down his face. Tanya looked at him in a sad way ""But how can we tell if we've been resurrected?"" she asked looking even worse. ""Now that you have met us you should get a dream of your past the images you see will probably not be pleasant but please we must know if you are the ones"" Diar said with a frown. ""What won't be pleasant about them?"" Natasha asked. ""You might see a great deal of torturing done by me. for in that time I was a villain the worst there was and I didn't like anyone getting in my way"" Kyoi said with a frown. The girls were a little taken aback by that but they regained themselves. ""Please don't breakdown from what you see, darkness is raising again and we need all the Kurai samurai to stop it"" Rue said crossing his arms in disgust. ""Ok then, well tell you if we have dream tomorrow, well see you later then"" Tanya said grabbing her bag. ""Bye"" they all waved and walked away. ""If there not the ones we'll have to erase there memories you know that"" Kyoi asked Rue. ""Yeah I know"" Rue took one last look at Tanya and thought he saw Niaka smiling at him but it was just Tanya fading away with her friends. Her hair blowing in the wind, the wind that whispers. 
Chapter 2: Times of Torture
Tanya sat down and waited for the next song to come on. This was the only way she could forget about what was going to happen tonight and how much her life had changed in one day. The next song that came on made her think it was Fire and Ice by Enya. The doorbell rang so her thoughts were interrupted. Tanya got up and ran to the door. She looked through the window and was slightly surprised; Rue was standing there a small- embarrassed grin on his face. Tanya smiled and opened up the door and said a polite hi. ""I want to talk with you for a second"" Rue said nervously. ""Okay. Mom I'll be back in an hour or so! Bye!"" Tanya grabbed her green coat and closed the door behind her. They walked awhile to a park known as Mary Ward. It was in the back part where there was a bit of a hill, that's where they sat. ""So what did you want to talk about?"" Tanya asked bringing her knees to her chest. ""Well, do you want to go through with this dream thing I can make it easier on you"" he replied looking at the ground. ""Did you offer anyone else help?"" Tanya asked slightly shocked. ""Well no-"" ""I'm not going to take any help if you didn't help any of the other's"" She said to him in a final sort of voice. ""I didn't help any of the other because your torture was the worst! You're too innocent to witness that! I. just don't want you to witness that if it was me in that situation I would have killed myself, but Niaka she didn't she kept on living the way she always did. In the end she died in my arms sacrificed herself to save me."" Rue was now holding Tanya's hands his face a jumble of emotion. ""I guess that's the way I have to learn."" Tanya said with a sigh if she was going to get the easy treatment everyone else was going to get it. ""Have you listened to a single thing I just said?"" Rue asked in a very serious voice. ""Oh course I did, but I'm not going to get the special treatment if everyone else has to suffer!"" Tanya yelled at him. ""Your just like her, she never wanted to be the only one left out even if it was being tortured. If she had to save her friends and that's the only way she could she'd do it."" Rue got up and outstretched his hand for her. Tanya took his hand and started to get up when Rue tripped. They both went down the hill together wind encircled both of them slowing them down. When they hit the bottom Tanya was on top of Rue hands on his chest, legs entangled. Rue looked up at her hazel eyes and noticed a blush forming on her freckled cheeks. Tanya pushed herself off Rue and sat back down, he pushed himself up and sat down to. ""What was that wind?"" Tanya asked a little curious. ""You could see it"" Rue asked her shocked. ""Yeah it was green and white it seemed to be protecting us"" Tanya replied now looking at him waiting to answer her question. ""Well, that's my power I control wind it protects me. I guess you are one of the Kurai since they and a few very strong magic beings and creatures can see it"" Rue added. Tanya just stared at him for a while when a question exploded from her mouth without her knowing. ""Can I hear you whisper?"" ""Well, I don't really whisper I can't its impossible for me but it's a power I have to make the wind whisper so I'll see if you can hear it"" He started to whisper but no words could be heard. The wind around them started to pick up making Tanya's hair whip across her face. She saw a type of green and white see through dragon float through the air, it was about two feet long but very thin its wings about half a foot. When the dragon flew to her she embraced it and heard the dragon whisper her name. ""Oh wow that's so cool!"" Tanya said very happy to see more magic done by Rue. Rue smiled at her and sighed ""Its very useful in tight spots you'll hear me do it once in your dream. We better get going I think the hours nearly over"" ""Okay"" Tanya got up and they walked back to Tanya's house in high spirits.

(This is the dream, which at parts will get very intense if you want to be sickened read away if you want to think about how sick my mind truly is read away, if you don't want to know I advise you skip it. I'll indicate when not to read and when its safe by these marks ~*~ okay now that I got that taken care of. My friends if they read this will be saying how gross my mind is its all those books I read were the main guys sick.well I better get on with it I'm wasting your time)

Tanya headed back inside the house it was late and her parents had left her a note. Feeling happy she quickly ate her meal and looked at the time. It was ten o' clock so she decided to go to bed. Rue said it was going to be hard for me to handle hopefully I can do it. Tanya sat there for many minutes thinking about many things that had happened during the day, when she slowly drifted off to sleep.

~*~ (Hahaha! Torture Time!) ~*~

""Niaka, you got to eat"" Rue offered a piece of bread. Niaka stood in the same field she was in her previous dream. ""Sure"" she sat down and gratefully took the bread. Niaka looked around the circle at the people who sat there eating. Rue looked the same as he always did accept he wore white robes. There was a green gem on his head that sometimes had a swirl of white in it. His hair had very little blonde in it; it was mostly white. He had black long earrings in both elfish ears. He wore a long white robe with black and white trim over a shirt with many chains and clasps. He wore fingerless gloves with a Japanese insignia on it. His white pants were really baggy but they were tucked into his boots, which were leather on the inside and metal on the outside with metal spikes. A giant sword lay by his side; it was very thick and had a funny shape. A guy sat beside him who was Numaka the information in Niaka's head was telling her. He had black hair that went back into a short ponytail. He had a scar on the side of his face shaped like a lightning bolt, and four black marks by his eye. He also had a gem on his forehead that was a bright yellow colour. He had an earring like Rue's but only one in both elfish ears. He wore white robes as well. He had a white cape that was draped around him, two black clasps held his cape to his shoulders. He had an insignia on his chest and clasps held the second layer on over the first layer of clothes. He wore baggy pants and the same boots as Rue except there were no spikes. His sword was even bigger then Rue and it was beside him. It had a handle and spikes it looked very heavy and powerful. A girl sat beside Numaka named Tara. She had shoulder length brown hair that was well kept. She had a marking on her face near her elfish ear that was light black in colour; she also had small black markings beside her eye. A gem was on her forehead but it looked more like an opal stone. She was wearing a black turtleneck and she had a necklace that looked like it was pure diamond. A white high collared cloak went over her shoulders. On her left leg black material only went down a little below her hip, on her left leg the material went down to her boots. The top of her boots looked like bandage then went into sandals. Beside her lay a white hat with yellow clasps and a black rope around it. There also lay many tiny daggers that had thin metal handles and diamond shaped blades. Diar sat beside a smile on his face. He wore those same orange goggles he always had on. White marks were below his eyes and he had a gem on his forehead that was pure white. He wore a zipped up white turtleneck with yellow trim. Clasped onto his turtleneck was a cloak with black markings the cloak went down to his feet. He wore baggy pants and metal boots that contained two diamonds. Beside him lay another sword much longer then all the rest but much thinner. A girl sat beside him by the name of Souppi. She had bright red hair that was decorated with cat ears. Two marks were on her jawbones that were light blue. The gem on her head was a mixture of azure, navy, and light blue. She wore a hooded white cape that clasped at the throat by a blue gem; many markings were on the cape. She wore a dress that was tied in the middle by a blue lash. She wore black tight pants under her dress that went down to her knee length leather boots. Beside her lay a bow, but instead of arrows there were numerous amounts of daggers with guiders on the end put in a blue quiver. Sitting beside Souppi was a girl named Naria. Her hair went all the way down her back in the back but her side bangs circled and shaped her jaw. She had three marking near her jawbone and her forehead gem was of a dark green colour. Her cloak came up around her shoulders and fastened there. Underneath her cloak she wore a shirt that was fastened by a sash. Her pants were loose but not as loose as the boys they went into her leather boots that had spikes coming from them. Beside here lay a long thin sword that looked very easy to kill with. Niaka looked beside her at her weapon that was a thin pliable sword that had a red scabbard. Even though it was really thin it was very long longer then any of the others swords.

Rue looked up to the sky and stood up. ""Do you guys hear that?"" he asked a note of panic in his voice. Naria had stood up to looking at the sky ""Yeah I don't like it."" Niaka looked at the ground and screamed ""Guys watch out below."" The ground started to vibrate and break apart Niaka fell through the cracks in the ground hitting hard ground meters below, she heard her name called before she passed out.

Niaka awoke in a room completely black everything was black and there were no windows. She was in a big bed that was all black, Niaka noticed a dark figure in the side of the room and began to panic. What the hell? The figure walked closer to her and smiled ""I hope you enjoyed your sleep."" Something about that smile innerved Niaka she didn't like it at all. He sat on the edge of the bed and spoke in a low voice ""I hope you enjoy your stay here since you won't be leaving for along time. You'll probably be here till you die"" He moved closer to Niaka to close for Niaka's comfort. He pulled out one hand from his cloak and stroked the side of Niaka's face, which made her shiver. He left her face then felt her blonde shoulder length hair. Niaka tried to push him away but he was incredibly strong. He bent low towards her lips inches away, in one swift movement their lips were together Niaka tried to break the kiss but couldn't. His eyes were full of an evil kind of wanting. He made the kiss more intense spreading her lips apart and exploring the insides of her mouth every corner free for him to explore. Niaka bit down on his tongue causing blood to spill into her mouth. The man pulled away and smiled ""Do you like the taste of Kyoi's blood?"" he asked slightly amused. Niaka said nothing looking at him with a glare. He put his hands on her arms making sure she couldn't get away. He put his legs around Niaka so they were straddling hers. He pushed himself back into her mouth happily exploring it again very roughly. He pulled away and started kissing down her neck when he found her cape he violently ripped it off. He placed when long thin finger on the edge of her shirt a grin on his face. ""I don't like your clothes"" he said in a harsh tone ""Why not get rid of them?"" Niaka lay there temporarily shock ""Never in a million years would I take off my clothes for you!"" she yelled finally finding the courage. ""Fine I'll take them off for you"" He pulled a dagger out from his boot and placed it to the edge of her clothes. He began to cut when he got to the edge of her breasts he licked his lips in triumph. He continued to cut until she was completely topless. He placed his finger in between her breasts and slid it down Niaka shiver under his touch trying to get out of his firm hold on her. He placed his lips in the middle of her breasts and licked at her warm skin. He smirked and stood up ""I think I had enough fun toying with you for now there's some clothes for you over there"" He pointed to the corner then headed out of the room.

Niaka stood up and walked over to the clothes all there was: was a black bra. She reluctantly put it on then went back to her cape and put it on to. She was now partially covered. She ran out of the door looking for her friends that might have been captured. She heard Kyoi's voice from a very dark room. She looked in and saw Rue on the wall held up by chains that were cutting into his skin. Kyoi smirked up at him and through dagger's at him that cut into his skin forcing him to scream out in pain. Blood was everywhere on the floor. He finally gave up throwing daggers and left the room not even noticing Niaka. Niaka ran in the room and looked up at Rue. ""Rue are.are you alright?"" Rue looked down at her and made a small pained smile coughing out blood. ""Yeah I'm alright. Did he do anything to you?"" Rue's voice was low and he hardly had the strength to talk. ""Well, yeah but don't worry about me I'll try to get you down"" Niaka looked at his chains when a cold hand was placed on her back. ""I don't think I want him out of those chains"" Two strong hands grabbed her shoulders and turned her around. He placed his lips roughly against hers. Rue looked down at him trying to get out of his chains he guessed what he had done to Niaka that Bastard! He placed her against the wall and smiled. ""I don't think your friend likes me touching you"" he motioned to Rue glaring at Kyoi. "" As far as I'm concerned he can't do a fucking thing"" Kyoi threw a dagger at Rues shoulder, which made Rue scream. Niaka slapped Kyoi across the face causing him to clutch it. ""Damn you women, I guess you haven't learned enough."" He ripped off her cape and examined her. ""At least its not as hard as last time"" He reached around her back and touched a spot on her spine which made her go limp and fall into him. He picked her up and looked at Rue ""You'll never be able to save her, her innocence will be mine."" She was back in the room her eyes had come back to focus Kyoi was on top of her stroking her face. ""Good this makes it all the more interesting"" Niaka looked at herself half her body was covered but she could tell she was completely naked or almost anyway. He placed his finger on her spine again causing her this time to pass out. He continued to play with her hours afterward. He finally left a demon flying into the room putting food beside her bed. The demon looked down at her and shacked its head. Niaka opened her eyes and suddenly felt a lot of pain. She walked towards the one mirror in the room and looked at her reflection there were bruises and cuts everywhere on her body even on her face. She ran over to the chair and put on the same black bra and short black shorts. She found her cape and draped it over her shoulders; she was incredibly weak. Wind came through the door that sounded like a whisper she noticed a dragon that was light green fly into the room towards her. She embraced the dragon and heard a familiar voice ""Are you okay Niaka? I'm going to use an ability I just learned over these past few days to escape form these chains. Please be careful I'll save the others then come for you. You seem to be his favourite plaything."" The dragon disappeared and Niaka stood up I'm going to find a way out of here. She ran out of the door not caring that there was a guard there now. She found a flight of stairs and climbed it seemed to go on forever she finally saw light and emerged on the top of what seemed to be a floating fortress. Niaka felt a long spiked tail wrap around her and she looked around. There lay a huge deadly looking dragon the size of the castle; it had huge jagged teeth. Its wings were ripped and its claws were feet long. Its spikes were meters long and its dominant horns were very prominent. ""You like my dragon do you?"" Kyoi placed his arms around Niaka in delight. ""Where did you get a dragon?"" she asked looking at him ignoring the fact that his arms were around her. ""I've had him since I was born"" Kyoi looked down at her ""His names Darak. Now come inside before he gets hungry."" Was Kyoi trying to protect me? Or just want to play with me some more? Kyoi jumped down the ladder that took Niaka so long to climb up. Niaka closed her eyes and jumped down to, Kyoi caught her and smiled. ""Don't jump if you can't float"" He carried down the hall till he came to a brightly decorated door. ""What's in there?"" Niaka asked looking at Kyoi. ""It's a torture room one of your friends is in there, I wanna have some fun."" He was about to push the door open with his free hand when Niaka gave him a glare. ""No, you're not hurting any of my friends anymore."" Niaka looked at him sternly. ""Then how do you propose I have fun, unless your suggesting you will be my only play toy.""? His lips curved into a smile. ""How about we battle?"" Niaka wiped out the thought of being tortured again. ""Fine, but it'll be quick, then I can do what ever I want with you"" He took her down to another room that was blank accept for the walls that were lined with weapons. ""Which one was yours?"" pointing at seven weapons on one wall. ""The one with the red hilt"" pointing at it. He threw it to her then took out his sword it was longer then hers it looked like a katana. ""This will be easy"" He disappeared in the darkness then reappeared behind her his sword right by her throat ""See easy."" Niaka grabbed his shoulders and flipped behind him her sword now at his throat. ""Not that easy is it"" a smirk playing at her face. He put his hand by her stomach making her jump back. His hand was full of a deadly black colour Niaka smiled and her hand erupted in flames. They met each other dead on Flames touching Darkness the flames cracked and wavered then suddenly they turned into whites flames that broke the darkness and caused Kyoi to scream. He looked up at her amazed then he smirked Black demon wings spread from his back causing his shirt to rip apart. Niaka looked up at him her smirk disappeared. ""I guess you don't know how to get wings yet to bad my powers have tripled"" He made the Darkness return to his hand this time Niaka knew she couldn't beat it. She tried to block with her fire but lost miserably. The Darkness hit her causing her to keel over and fall unconscious.

Night had come when Niaka opened her eyes she noticed this since the room was darker then usual. Kyoi's arms were wrapped around her waist. He was still shirtless from the fight and nothing seemed to have happened to her. I guess he was weak from my white flame go figure. A demon walked into the room and Niaka immediately closed her eyes. She felt Kyoi removed his arms and sit upright ""What's wrong?"" Kyoi asked in a whisper. ""The prisoners have escaper my Lord all of them."" Kyoi stood up right away and walked up to the demon. ""How the fuck did this happen?"" Kyoi asked grabbing the demon by the throat. ""My Lord I don't know"" In a few seconds the demon was gone Kyoi had killed him. He walked over to Niaka and lifted her up ""Your not escaping with them"" he walked out the door and looked for any sign of them. Niaka purposely hung limp so Kyoi thought she was asleep. She would finally be free; it had been months since she had seen the light. Kyoi heard a noise behind him and quickly took out his sword. Niaka opened her eyes and white flames appeared burning his hands. Niaka ran as fast as she could down the long halls when she finally saw a green fragment of wind she smiled. She touched it then immediately disappeared. They were on the top part of the fortress all of them were there, all seven of them. Rue was bloody and fell to the ground as soon as the wind disappeared. Numaka was missing in arm; blood was dripping down from it. Naria was cut all over her face and hands she was probably bleeding in other places since blood could be seen through the white material. Tara was bleeding like Naria all over. Souppi had been scarred over her face and hands deep scars were visible. Diar was on the ground moving in and out of consciousness. Niaka ran to the ladder that she had been earlier that day. She could hear wings from below, suddenly; Kyoi shot out of the passage his eyes glowed red. ""Darak! It's time you feasted on a Kurai!"" Kyoi pulled out his sword and flew towards Rue. Rue picked up his sword and blocked Kyoi's strike just noticing the dragon. ""Diar help us out please!"" Rue called to him. Diar was still on the floor unconscious. Niaka ran over to him and made a white flame appear in her hand ""Diar look at the light!"" Diar awoke and looked at the light, light built around him then there was a flash of white light that knocked Kyoi to the ground. When the light disappeared everyone of the Kurai were healed. Kyoi got up and growled he mounted his dragon and laughed the dragon rose in the air and started to attack the Kurai. Naria stepped up and spikes appeared from the floor of the fortress piercing the dragons thick hide making it screech out in pain. Kyoi flew down and pierced Numaka right through the heart. Niaka ran over to him he was instantly dead, but Kyoi's rampage wasn't done he had stabbed Tara and Souppi. Four of the seven Kurai were left Naria stood her ground her sword at the ready. Diar flared his power at Kyoi making Kyoi momentarily stunned. Naria attacked Kyoi hitting his face that would leave a scar over his eye. Kyoi screamed in rage and raised his hands that contained a questionable amount of Dark energy. He attacked Diar with so much Dark energy that he died. Naria and Niaka at the same time attacked the dragon killing it with White Flames and Earthen Spikes. Kyoi screamed yet again like a part of him had died. He attacked Naria who had been ready she attacked back but had not judged his movements well enough. He had struck her through the neck she got out two words before she died ""You Bastard."" Kyoi turned around and attacked Rue he aimed right for his heart but Niaka ran straight in front of him the sword impaled through her heart Kyoi looked shocked. He had killed his woman. Rue held her in his arm and stroked her face. ""Sorry, I had to do that didn't want you to die I have seen to many deaths in this lifetime, I'll see you in the next"" Rue grabbed her hand and looked in her half closed eyes. ""I.love.you."" She smiled up at him and touched his face then nodded he lowered his head and kissed her. Kyoi pierced Rue right in the heart but Rue stood up unharmed. ""I'm immortal you fool, she's the tool of immortality and you killed her!"" Rues slashed at him and instantly he died. Rue stood up and cried for the first time in his life for his friends.
Chapter 3: The Transformation Begins
(Dragula is owned by Rob Zombie)
Tanya walked the way to school much on her mind; she had woken up early this morning a real change. A small group of girls and boys were at the entrance discussing something. Natasha popped her head out of the circle and ran towards me. ""Hey, Are you okay you don't look like your usual self?"" Natasha asked a frown playing at her face. ""Yeah, I'm fine I was just thinking"" Tanya said smiling to her friend. ""So what happened to you?"" Tanya asked. ""Well I awoke in this type of clear pod thing this goop around me trapping me and then the worst were the spikes that rose putting pin pricks into my back every time Kyoi came in"" Natasha replied then asked ""What happened to you?"" ""Well he molested me, many times"" Tanya looked up at Natasha's enraged face. ""That bastard I had no idea damn him, and you had to see that? God why was he resurrected?"" Natasha started pacing and looking at Kyoi with a glare. ""Umm. What happened to the others?"" Tanya asked unsure if Natasha would snap at her. ""Ah, let's see Rue was chained to a wall and had, daggers thrown at him. Numaka was beaten by demons in a pitch-dark room. Tara was strapped to a broken cross and whipped harshly. Diar was left in a dark room since he can't live without light for to long. Souppi had been stripped naked and whipped by Demons"" Natasha said still pacing. The rest of the group came over to Tanya and Natasha still talking. ""Okay, today will be our last day of school and the last day to see your parents. It's the day of good byes,"" Rue said putting his hand through his hair. ""Then were off on a journey to find our dragons, and also begins the start of our transformations"" Diar said pointing his finger in the air. The bell rang and all of them ran to their classroom sitting in there respectful seats.

Mr. Fisert walked into the classroom and looked around at the class. ""I have terrible news-"" ""Like Dude I want to learn"" Brock said putting his hands in the air. ""Well anyway eight people will be leaving this classroom forever"" Mr. Fisert continued ignoring Brock. The class looked around the room wondering who would be leaving. ""Well, maybe not forever"" Rue said standing up were only leaving for a prolonged period of time. ""Well let's get on with school, everyone get changed for gym"" Mr. Fisert walked out of the classroom followed by the rest of the class. The girls went into their change rooms the boys into theirs. ""What the hell I am not wearing this!"" Kyoi stood up outraged. The outfit was 30-centimeter shorts and the shirt was body tight. "" Oh come on Kyoi they make you look sexy"" Diar said modeling around the room with Rue just standing there ready to burst out laughing at anytime. ""EW Image"" Kyoi put his hands in front of his face and began to change. ""Did you just insult my perfect figure?"" Diar yelled. ""Yeah I did in fact I think my body surpasses yours"" Kyoi and Diar glared daggers at each other. Rue walked out of the room shaking his head. ""What was all that yelling about?"" Meaghan questioned Rue. ""Let's just say it's a fight to see who looks better in spandex"" Rue walked away smiling 'there outfits are much worse then ours'. The girls had to wear really short shorts and a tie up shirt. Kyoi and Diar came out of the change room Kyoi looked straight ahead and Diar had his head in the air.

The gym class started and it turned out they'd be playing volleyball girls against guys. The girls started with the ball Kelsey a brunette served it, it went smoothly over the net. Diar smiled and volleyed it back; Natasha volleyed it to the boy's side. Diar volleyed it back again. ""You wuss volleying is for sucks."" Kyoi smirked and spiked it over the net getting a point for the guys. ""I'll show you.fucking bitch,"" Diar whispered. ""What did you call me?!"" Kyoi yelled. ""You heard me dumb ass!"" Diar yelled back. ""Like Dude their fighting,"" Brock said dumbly. Rue shook his head and stepped in between them. ""Don't fight guys, or I'll kick your ass so hard you won't be able to shit anymore,"" Rue said sarcastically. The fight had taken up most of the gym period but the guys still managed to win. The rest of the day was uneventful unless you count the incident where Brock tripped over, his own to feet and landed on top of his cousin lips connected. That was hilarious, it got funnier when he got up and said 'Dude, whoa.'

The day finally over and now it was time for the part Tanya and everyone else of the group hated saying goodbye to their parents. Tanya ran home hoping this would go smoothly. She opened the door of her house and walked in. ""Mom, Dad I have something I want to tell you!"" Tanya yelled. When her parents were in the living room looking smug she began, ""Well, I have to leave for a long time on a journey with my friends, I won't see you for along time. I just found out the other day I was a resurrection of an ancient samurai known as a Kurai."" Her parents looked dumbstruck. ""Well dear, if that's what you have to do we can't stop you just hurry back. I'll help you pack"" Tanya's mom and dad hugged her then Tanya's mom went to her room to help her pack. Okay what do I need hmm.a sleeping bag. The doorbell rang and she ran down to get it. Rue was at the door and looked in a rush. ""Okay all you have to pack is clothes, we can take care of the rest"" Rue motioned to Kyoi and Diar who still glared at each other. ""Okay thanks for telling me, I'll see you when?"" Tanya asked. ""Tomorrow at five in the morning"" Rue said turning away. ""Okay, bye"" Tanya waved and closed the door. Before she new it she was in bed in a dreamless sleep.

""Honey, your friends are here to pick you up"" Tanya looked up at her mom who was crying. Tanya hugged and kissed her then did the same to her dad. ""I'll try and be back soon"" Tanya waved and looked at everyone who was carrying nothing. ""Where's all the luggage?"" Tanya asked. ""Kyoi put our luggage in a portal he can transport our luggage to where we want to go instantly"" Stephanie said happily. ""Well that's handy"" Tanya said walking up to Kyoi. ""Here"" Kyoi's hands dropped trying to hold the bag. ""What the hell did you bring?"" Kyoi asked opening the dark portal. ""None of your business"" Tanya glared and walked over to Natasha, Meaghan, and Stephanie. ""So where are we going?"" Meaghan asked looking at the empty street. ""Were going to go find my dragon he's in the biggest field in the world by mountains,"" Rue said joyfully. ""Where exactly is this field?"" Stephanie said looking down at her feet. ""Its miles away were going to take a light portal to get closer but we can't go into Windygo's land or we will all be let's just say as good as dead."" Rue said looking around the group. ""So were still going to have to walk many miles"" Rue implied. They all sighed and went through the portal except for Kyoi who went through his own portal.

""Wow that was awesome"" Tanya said running out of the portal. ""Yeah I know its cool cause it's my power a sexy man has to have sexy power,"" Diar said in triumph. ""Then I guess it's going to suck since your not sexy at all,"" Kyoi said looking at him. ""Give me five minutes with him I'll kick his ass"" Diar said while being restrained by the whole group including Adam. Adam turned out to be Numaka pretty cool. ""Um. Guys I have to go to the washroom"" Meaghan said slightly embarrassed. ""Well go"" Rue said staring at here as if she had never went to the washroom before. ""Where?"" Meaghan asked. ""In the woods"" Rue replied still looking at her in a strange way. ""Girls don't go in the woods!"" Meaghan yelled. ""Well, I don't see a washroom with mirrors and all that crap appearing do you"" Diar said also looking at her strangely. ""Fine, stupid forest why didn't I go back home? Damn."" Meaghan continued muttering all the way through the forest. Meaghan sat down and continued to mutter while she went to the washroom (for anyone who knows the code well only one of my friends Meg's doing operation C.)

Tanya sat down in the grass and smiled the wind playing with her hair. Suddenly an ear-piercing scream sounded through the air. ""That sounded like Meaghan!"" Tanya jumped up and the girls circled around. ""You don't think it's that time of the month do you?"" Tanya asked. ""No I don't think she'd scream"" Natasha said. Kyoi looked at the girls ""What do you think there talking about?"" Kyoi asked no one in particular. ""Well if you had a brain you would know. They're probably saying that maybe Meaghan has diarrhea, or maybe there's a monster in the forest ready to kill us all!"" Diar laughed. When they heard a large growl and another scream the boys started to run to the forest. ""Hey wait she could have her pants down we'll go"" The girls ran into the forest not caring what had made that noise. ""We have to go after them they don't have their powers or there weapons yet"" Rue ran into the forest the other guys followed. Meaghan was standing there fully dressed looking up at what looked to be an ogre. The ogre was black with a gooey substance all over its body; it carried a club with spikes on the end. ""Shit an ogre!"" Diar yelled pushing the girls back. ""We don't want you girls getting hurt when we just found you"" Diar took up a fighting stance when Kyoi pushed him out of the way. ""Take the girls and Numaka and run don't worry yourself here"" Kyoi yelled at him and went into a fighting stance, Rue did the same. Diar ran with the girls and growled at the same time, muttering to himself. They were back in the open safe and sound.

Kyoi glared at the ogre ""You.will.die!"" Kyoi yelled wings spreading from his back. The ogre was thrown into the clearing from the force of the energy landing near the girls. The ogre stood up and looked at the girls it swung its club at Natasha. ""No!"" Kyoi flew in front of the club grabbing it his eyes going red. (I need some music) Kyoi started punching the ogre and kicking it anything possible. Kyoi was knocked off guard and hit a tree. He flew back and lit his whole body in darkness growling at the ogre.

Dead I am the one, Exterminating son

Slipping through the trees, strangling the breeze

Dead I am the sky, watching angels cry

As they slowly turn, conquering the worm

Daggers appeared in his hands he flew up to the ogre and started to slash away at its great bulk.

He merged the two daggers together to become a dark energy sword he pierced the ogre through the eyes and continued to hack away at it.

Dig through the ditches,

The ogre ran at him with his club swinging madly around. The ogre hit him in the side of the face sending him through a tree. ""Fool a pitiful creature like you can't kill me!"" Kyoi took off and flew straight at the ogre.

Dig through the ditches,

Kyoi flew through the ogre it's guts and blood flying everywhere the beautiful grass stained with blood. His wings disappeared and he fell to the ground. ""Kyoi!"" Rue ran over to him and picked him up. ""We better put up camp over their tonight"" He pointed to a hill overlooking the valley below, the valley of grass. Kyoi awoke a few minutes later very weak and frustrated. ""Why don't you guys take a bath?"" Tanya asked standing up looking at a stream in the distance. ""Good idea"" Kyoi said trying to walk to the stream but fell over trying. All four of the boys went to the stream the girls looked the opposite way. Diar immediately started yelling things the girls didn't want to hear. 'Damn how come everyone always beats me and you that's just wrong!' Images bad, bad images! An hour or so later of hearing numerous more of 'Now that's just wrong' the guys came back. ""Guys what was all that about?"" Stephanie asked. ""Well.um. yeah"" Diar started laughing a little. Kyoi smacked him on the back of the head ""This guy is sick."" ""Well you girls better take a bath to its very refreshing"" Adam said smiling. ""Well I guess"" Tanya and the rest of the girls stood up and walked over to the stream. ""No Peeking!"" Tanya yelled looking over at the guys. ""My this is refreshing"" Natasha said the water draining from her cupped hands. ""So who brought the binoculars?"" Diar asked with a smile. ""You little perverted freak"" Kyoi said hitting him again. ""Well at least I didn't rape a girl I didn't know millions of years ago."" Diar said rubbing his head. ""Don't even talk about that ever again"" Kyoi glared at him. ""I bet you want to look at her through these!"" Diar held up a pair of binoculars joyfully. "" I don't wanna fucking look at her ok!"" Kyoi grabbed the binoculars and chucked them into the forest. The girls came back looking very happy. ""What's with them?"" Meaghan asked pointing at Diar and Kyoi. Kyoi was strangling Diar and swearing at him. ""Let's just say Diar's a perverted freak with a perverted mind and Kyoi wants to strangle him for many reasons"" Rue looked over at them and saw Adam trying to pry Kyoi off Diar. ""Well lets eat I had time to go catch some fish and find some berries and stuff like that"" Rue said looking at his fine catch that was as big as a small hill. ""When did you do all that I saw you sitting there the whole time"" Adam said looking at him curiously. ""Well that's a secret I don't feel like saying"" Rue said glancing at the girls who were going through a bag. ""What are you girls doing?"" Rue inquired curiously. ""Who wants chicken, mashed potatoes, carrots, and apple pie for dessert!?"" Tanya said getting up all the girls smiled. ""No wonder it was so heavy"" Kyoi said rubbing his head. ""HOW COME YOU NEVER TOLD ME!"" Rue yelled. ""It was a surprise!"" Tanya yelled back. ""Yo! Dude she brought beer!"" Diar jumped around hugging the beer. Everyone sweat dropped.

After eating and seeing Diar get drunk and sing Dancing Queen at the top of his lungs it was time for bed. It was a full moon; the grass appeared to be blue now instead of green. ""Wow its pretty here when it's a full moon"" Tanya said looking up at the millions of stars. Rue smiled at her the wind wiped around them, everyone else seemed to be asleep. ""Yeah, we better get to bed it's a long day tomorrow"" Rue said looking at the people asleep. ""Kyoi is a fucking retard that is into men,"" Diar said in his sleep. ""Thank god I got that on tape"" Tanya said happily. ""Did you bring your whole room with you?"" Rue asked. ""My mom likes me to be well packed. well Night Rue"" Tanya turned over and pulled her blankets up. Rue stared at her for a while before going to bed.

Rue walked around the figures and kicked the boys and poked the girls awake. Tanya stood up and looked at Rue. ""Rue how come your hairs lighter?"" Tanya asked looked at Rue's now almost white hair. ""I wouldn't talk,"" he pointed at her hair and she felt it. Her hair had grown it was now a little past her shoulders and now more blonde. Kyoi stood up and felt his ribs his hair had not changed. The rest of the gang stood up and rubbed their eyes. Diar hadn't changed, but Adam's hair had turned black and was in a small ponytail. Natasha's was stunning it was long and her bangs circled her face. Meaghan's was no longer curly it was straight and lighter. Stephanie's was longer and in a ponytail.

What the hell is going on here?
Chapter 4: Windygo the Dragon of Wind
""Well now I'm confused"" Tanya looked around the group, ""What's going on?"" ""Well, we have begun our transformation now that were altogether we will take our natural appearances and our powers will grow greater,"" Rue said smirking. ""So were going to be even sexier then before!"" Diar yelled jumping in the air. ""Or uglier"" Kyoi said looking at him. ""Why you!"" Diar jumped at Kyoi but Kyoi had sensed the movement and grabbed his wrists. ""Don't you dare!"" Kyoi growled looking at the twinkle in Diar's eyes. He did. Diar kneed him right in the crotch, Kyoi started to moan on the ground while Diar walked away to get some beer. ""Bastard"" Kyoi mumbled getting up. ""Okay who wants Eggo's!"" Tanya yelled happily. ""But we don't have a toaster."" Natasha pointed out. ""I brought one along its solar powered!"" Tanya put the Eggo's in the toaster watching it go red inside. ""Is she okay?"" Adam asked looking at her face that smiled so fully you would have thought it was going off her face. ""She's um.slightly insane."" Natasha said looking at her. All the Eggo's finally popped and they ate with happiness. ""Well today were going to see Windygo my dragon"" Rue stood up and started to walk. ""Hey wait for us to get packed!"" Tanya put her hand out and a bit of flame appeared. ""Ah! Sweet!"" She closed her palm again and the flame disappeared. ""There were packed"" Rue walked down the hill smiling to himself. ""What? How?"" Tanya looked behind her and saw Kyoi putting all the things into the dark portal. ""He's good"" Meaghan said looking at the luggage. ""Lets get going"" Adam motioned the girls to follow Rue. Tanya ran to Rue and smiled. ""What's the rush?"" Tanya smiled up at him. ""When you see your dragon you'll know"" Rue looked down at her and started to run. ""Hey wait for us!"" The whole group chased after him until them came to a huge hole in the ground. It was more then 70 feet long all dirt. Nothing was in it not yet anyway. ""He's out eating"" Rue said sitting down. ""We will wait here"" Rue closed his eyes focusing on something.

The sky started to get dark and there was still no sign of Windygo. ""Damn Rue where's your fucking dragon!"" Kyoi yelled. Rue glared at him a wicked smile playing at his face. ""Give him some time, well rest here tonight till he comes"" Rue closed his eyes again in concentration. "" I'm running out of food better save it till its needed we'll have to eat berries I guess"" Tanya scratched the back of her head. They began to eat berries Rue just sat there looking into the distance. Tanya stood up and walked towards Rue she was about to touch his shoulder when she fell. She didn't trip there was nothing to trip on but she had tripped into the nest of Windygo. ""Tanya!"" Rue screamed. Wind encircled her slowing her down. Rue jumped down himself looking down into her weak face. ""I think something was wrong with one of those.."" Tanya fainted. ""Shit she's poisoned! Kyoi get down here!"" Kyoi flew down and looked at Tanya. ""Take her up and rap her in blankets get Diar to get some water with the help of Meaghan, Numaka and Stephanie will come with me to search for a plant and Natasha will stay and look after Tanya"" Rue dashed off with Numaka and Stephanie in the forest. Diar and Meaghan grabbed a pail and a cloth and ran to the stream. Kyoi wrapped Tanya in a blanket and sat down beside her looking her straight in the face. Natasha sat beside her as well putting her hand on her forehead. ""Ah! She's burning up!"" Natasha said removing her hand. ""If she's not awake she can't fight it, it will take effect quicker"" Kyoi said somehow knowing the subject. ""Well how can we wake her up without hurting her?"" Natasha asked looking at him. ""The poison was from a berry right?"" Natasha nodded slightly confused. ""So she ate it.Let's see"" Kyoi looked at her and leaned a bit closer his eyes going black. ""Kyoi?"" Natasha asked now slightly scared. ""Hey we got the water!"" Diar sat down beside her and put the moist clothe on her head. Kyoi leaned back his eyes going back to red. ""What happened?"" Natasha asked looking at him. ""What? What did I do?"" Kyoi asked confused. ""Um. never-mind"" Natasha looked back at Tanya who's breathing had slowed. Rue ran out of the forest with the two others. ""Okay I got the plant we just need to wake her up"" Rue sat down next to her and shook her gently. Tanya's eyes opened a fraction and stared up at Rue. She was about to speak when Rue stopped her. ""Can you chew just shake your head or nod?"" Rue instructed her. Tanya tried chewing and swallowing but it was very hard for her, so she shook her head. They all looked at Rue what was he going to do? Rue put the plant in his mouth and started to chew he then lowered himself and put the plant in her mouth. It wasn't that hard to swallow, she nodded up to him and closed her eyes. ""Don't go to sleep, the poison will cure faster if your awake the rest of you get some rest"" Rue said to her looking worried. Most of them left to get blankets and sleep except for Natasha who sat there staring at her friend. ""Will she be alright?"" Natasha asked looking up at Rue. ""She'll be fine"" Rue looked back down at Tanya and frowned. ""I have to tell you something. When you were in the woods Kyoi started acting really strange"" Natasha looked at Rue to see his reaction. ""What did he do?"" Rue asked concerned. ""He kinda went into this trance and leaned closer to Tanya"" Natasha said eyes dropping. ""You better get to sleep"" Rue said getting a blanket. ""Thanks, make sure Tanya's alright.Night"" Natasha fell asleep and Rue pulled up the blanket. Tanya looked up at Rue and smiled, ""Thanks for the help."" Tanya grabbed Rue's hand weakly and smiled closing her eyes. Rue looked down at her and brought the hair out of her face.

The sun appeared over the mountains making Kyoi and the others wake. A gem had appeared on everyone's forehead and for the ones who had scars the scars had appeared. Rue had a scar, Kyoi, Tanya, and Adam. ""Rue you were up all night?"" Meaghan asked startled. ""Well yeah"" Rue said smiling, Tanya was smiling beside him sitting up. Well one thing was unnerving and that was the fact that Rue didn't even look tired. Diar looked into the sky and noticed a black object coming nearer. ""Um.guys what the hell is that?"" Diar asked pointing to the sky. Rue looked up and smiled ""That's Windygo."" Rue started to speak but no words were audio able a gust of wind played with everyone's hair and clothes. Rue looked happily up to the sky the dragon coming quickly nearer. A great gust of wind appeared knocking everyone off there feet except for Rue. The dragon settled itself in its nest, the thing was huge bigger then anything they had ever seen. It was a light green in colour; it had long feathers as wings. Feather's bordered it's head it's big yellow eyes gazed down at them as it made a screeching noise that was barely audio able.

Rue smiled and walked to the edge of the nest looking up at Windygo. Windygo brought its head closer and sniffed Rue. Rue smiled when Windygo allowed Rue to pat him he stroked Windygo's fine scaly face and whispered to him. ""Well looks like the love birds are back together,"" said Diar with a whole Kleenex box. Rue glared at him and so did Windygo. ""I didn't mean that."" Diar said hiding behind Kyoi. ""Figures"" Kyoi said walking away. ""Well where are we off to now?"" said Stephanie standing up. ""Grand Canyon"" Rue said still stroking Windygo. ""Grand Crayon, I'd love to see that"" Diar said laughing. ""Windygo will stay here once all the dragons are located the gems on our foreheads will glow making the dragons come to us. They also sense when we are endanger they will come to us then to"" Rue said walking towards Diar. ""Lets get going"" Rue patted Diar on the back. Kyoi had already packed everything and was waiting for Diar to leave. Tanya tried to stand up but stumbled and fell back down. Rue walked over to her and picked her up ""Windygo I'll see you soon"" Rue walked into the portal and they disappeared. Kyoi stood there for a minute then walked into his portal. The dragon screeched roared back and took off into the distance.

Chapter 5: The great Stone Dragon Sadaharu
They appeared in a place of pure rock and stone towering over everything else. ""Oh wow"" Meaghan said peering over the edge of the rock railing. ""Well now it's time for some rock climbing,"" Rue said looking down into the valley. Tanya got out of Rue's arms and took a few steps back. ""What's wrong?"" Rue asked looking at her. ""I'm afraid of heights,"" she said shivering. ""Well I'll take you down then come here"" Rue put out his arms and smiled. Tanya reluctantly stepped closer to Rue then he picked her up and whispered something to her which made her giggle. Natasha stepped to the edge and looked back to the rest of the group, ""Guys come on what are you waiting for?"" Natasha asked. ""Diar what the hell are you talking about?"" Rue asked interested. ""Did you say you liked Meaghan's ass?"" Kyoi said smirking at him. Natasha started to laugh forgetting where she was when she lost footing and started to fall. She grabbed the side of the rock her fingers starting to slip Kyoi noticed this and grabbed her arm. ""Hang on I'm going to pull you up"" Kyoi started to pull but his boots lost footing and they both fell. Kyoi grabbed Natasha's hands and pulled her closer to him trying to extend his wings. At the last minute they opened but it wasn't in time he hit the bottom hard. ""Natasha! Kyoi!"" Tanya yelled looking over the edge. She couldn't see the bottom. ""Let's get down there and help them we have to find them"" Tanya started to climb down and the rest followed.

Natasha looked down at Kyoi who had taken the full impact of the fall. He moved slightly under her and she sat beside him very worried he might have broken his bones. Kyoi opened one eye and looked at Natasha. ""You okay?"" he asked blood dripping from the side of his mouth. ""Yeah, what about you what's wrong?"" Natasha looked at him and wiped the blood from his face with the bottom of her shirt. ""I think I broke something but it'll heal in a few hours"" Kyoi turned his head and noticed a cave. ""We can go in there for safety help me up"" Kyoi watched her get up and outstretch her hand. He took it ignoring the pain in his chest. As soon as they got to the cave Kyoi pulled back in his wings and lowered himself slowly to the ground. Natasha leaned onto the cave wall watching him close his eyes and tries to sleep. Natasha closed her eyes and slowly drifted off to sleep.

""When does this thing end?"" Meaghan asked losing her footing but pulling herself back up. ""Well it has to fit a dragon with really long tails"" Rue said lowering himself even lower. ""Lucky Bastard"" Tanya said looking at Rue floating in mid air. ""Hey I offered to lift you"" Rue shrugged. ""I never said no"" Tanya said taking her arms off the wall and falling. Rue caught her and said, ""So my services are in need."" ""Ah. Shut up"" Tanya pouted. They flew lower finally hitting ground it was night by then.

Kyoi sat up and felt his chest as good as new. He looked over at Natasha and smiled she had fallen asleep I can see why I'm not that good of company. Natasha opened her eyes and noticed Kyoi was awake and staring at her. ""You better now?"" she asked looking at him. ""Yeah I'm all healed up I think I'm going to go look if there's anything else in this cave."" Kyoi got up and walked through the depths of the cave. 'I wonder what that was all about'.

Tanya was searching around until she hit her head against something hard ""Ouch."" Tanya said clutching her head. ""I think it's time we rest for the night can't see a damn thing"" Rue sat down setting out the blankets. It was bloody cold down here and there was nothing that could change that. Diar got the remaining beer and drank it falling asleep almost immediately. Meaghan, Stephanie, and Numaka just shrugged grabbed some blankets and closed their eyes. Rue was sitting there shivering Tanya doing the same. ""Um."" Tanya said looking at Rue. ""What is it?"" Rue asked grabbing one of the blankets. ""Can I join you?"" Tanya asked hopefully. He looked at her and nodded ""Makes all a little warmer."" Tanya walked over to Rue and went under the blanket with him looking up at the sky so far above. They both soon fell asleep.

Kyoi came back about fifteen minutes seeing Natasha shivering. ""There's a hot spring back here if you want to warm up"" Kyoi asked barely visible in the darkness. She got up and put her hands out in front of her trying to find her way around. Kyoi grabbed her hand and guided her through the darkness. Natasha felt hot water under her feet and smiled as her feet went warm. ""Okay I'll leave you like that for a little bit"" Kyoi said walking around the corner. Natasha quickly got undressed and slipped herself into the hot spring it was so refreshing. After about fifteen minutes of warmth Kyoi called to her to get dressed. ""Okay I'm dressed"" Kyoi grabbed her hand and led her back to the front of the cave. He had boarded up the exit with rocks to make it warmer but only slightly. Natasha feeling relaxed fell asleep soon Kyoi did the same.

Tanya woke up in the morning and felt incredibly different she looked down at her chest and gasped 'holy shit'. Then she noticed where she was, she was leaning on Rue chest her arms around him and his arms around her. She smiled and blushed slightly 'guess we had moved closer at night'. 'What a change though It'll take me awhile to get use to this'. Rue opened his eyes and looked down at her she had her eyes open and was thinking about something. ""Do I make a good pillow?"" Rue asked smiling. ""Ah! Oh your awake yeah.what.. um.. yeah"" Tanya said blushing. Rue laughed and hugged her then feeling that something was different looked at her again. ""Yeah I went through some changes I consider them major"" Tanya said looking up at his face. ""Umm.what kind of changes?"" Rue asked. ""About how big were Niaka's boobs?"" Tanya asked. ""Well ah.um.don't know"" Rue said looking at her puzzled. ""Well that's what I got now"" Tanya said looking away. ""Woah."" Rue looked at the ground ""That's pretty big."" ""So you did know!"" Tanya said standing up. ""I know again,"" Rue said looking over her body. Tanya just glared at him and walked away with her bag. They were all staring at Rue sitting up. ""What did you do?"" Diar said looking at him. ""Um. you'll see"" Rue said standing up and gathering the unused blankets. ""What do you mean?"" asked Meaghan. Then she looked down and stood up. ""Never mind!"" ""What's going on?"" asked Adam. ""Meh"" Diar said ""But we better start looking for Natasha and Kyoi soon.""

Natasha woke up and blinked everything around her was a blur. She focused her eyes and noticed two strong arms around her. She tried to push them off but couldn't. ""KYOI!"" Natasha yelled. Kyoi woke up instantly and looked around expecting a fight. ""What, what is it?"" Kyoi asked now very confused. ""You had your arms around me!"" Natasha glared at him. ""Oh"" Kyoi looked at the barricade and made it disappear. ""We better start looking for everyone,"" He said standing. When she didn't stand up right away he looked down at her and fell over. She stood up and growled 'men'. Kyoi got up and followed her running to keep up with her enraged strides.

Rue was walking with Tanya behind him she still looked furious. ""I'm sorry I don't know what came over me okay,"" Rue said glancing back. Tanya noticed Natasha up ahead and ran past Rue hugging her friend. ""I was so worried about you!"" Tanya said letting go. ""Kyoi took the fall,"" Natasha said glaring at him. ""Ah.Kyoi the little love prince."" Diar said clutching his chest. ""Diar one day I'll poison you and use your ligaments as sticks for my dragon"" Kyoi said glaring at him.

Meaghan ran around the corner and noticed the longest spikes tail in the history of tails. It could have gone all the way around the Grand Canyon. "" Um.Guys is that my dragon?"" Rue ran up behind her and nodded. ""Yeah that's Sadaharu see if he accepts you!"" Rue pushed her over to her dragon. She slowly followed the tail to its source and found a large gray dragon with no back legs its eyes were black and its spikes were 1 and a half meters long. The dragon looked at her and smelt her. It growled a crackled growl and then came back down for Meaghan to stroke it. Meaghan was happy and she stroked the creature. ""Isn't that cute"" Stephanie said from around the corner. ""Where are we off to next"" Adam looked at Rue. ""Um.Caribbean"" Rue looked around. ""We better get going Meaghan!"" Diar said turning around and opening the portal. They all stepped in and Kyoi looked at the dragon and bowed to it. Then disappeared. The dragon growled again and sank into the side of the Grand Canyon only a statue left behind.</lj-cut>"

"event","A short little naw post about current events. There's a craft show on Sunday at our school and half of the money a person makes goes to them the other half goes to the art club. Jix and I have started the bookmarks. There looking pretty good. And I think I'm just gonna take some old junk and finish it up. Sell those, like from my old sketch books and stuff. I don't know about halloween yet but whatever happens, happens right? Theres also the scary movie party. The last few I've watched just had an interesting weird plot not anything to be afraid of. Maybe I'm getting use to them or maybe they weren't scary at all. But so far this week is looking good Jix, Sam and I did the mummy thing in school (spirit week sorta) we could be called the neatest mummy in my opinion we did a good job. And next Wednesdays Take your kids to work day! So free day! Well that's all i'll get out for now."

"event","A short little entry that proves I'm still living. First of all I'm gonna thank Jix for all the wonderful Icons she made me and the wonderful jounral aswell. Thanks Jix!Thanks very much! Well some news I've started highschool, my first year yeah! I'm having a really good time, cool new friends and the classes are more informative. I've also be doing quite well. Homeworks a drag but that's okay. I'm still addicted to FF7 but still haven't managed to beat it. -_-' I've been drawing more lately and I feel I've improved. I'm thinking of starting a few things but they'll probably never get started, never mind finished.

Poetry is becoming more of a habit probably because we're doing poetry in english but it's put a new twist to my poetry and for that I'm thankful. I'll end it there and by saying Jix I love your new icon journal. Your icons rock ^^"

"event","I have beaten my record and am now the official capping master! I was able to cap every 8 oz. bottle by myself with no assistance and also able to get my own caps and put out more bottles. I also think I know what I'm going to do for Natasha's birthday finally. And I've chanced the idea for my room instead of drawing on the wall I'm going to frame many pictures. It's easier and if I get bored of the current pictures I can just draw a new one and take the others down. A good idea anyway. And I also am going to try to keep some goals for the summer (I probably won't be able to achieve any never have never will) But anyway let's see here (I know this is copying Natasha but everyone needs to keep goals right? I"" sure she won't mind)

Draw pictures and frame them for my room (Must do or room will be painted pink)
Lift weights (I need just a little muscle before I go back to school)
Be able to touch my feet with my hands (Never happen)
Try to fill my sketchbook (won't happen either)
Try out Photoshop and try to cg some work of mine (Doubt that'll happen)
Learn how to play One winged angel, scarlet, Sara, and some other song on the piano.
Beat Final Fantasy 7 (this'll happen or I'll never be able to sleep again)

Well those are all for now and yes I'll still can't sleep I'm getting closer though. Natasha's coming back shortly so I'm happy but I'm also working almost everyday this week and I'm already getting bored. Must think of new ideas for stuff. I did get a chapter title that won't give away much for DS ""I'm what?"" wait it does hehehe... Anyway I'm in a groove today so I'll try to draw some more. Toodle!"

"event","On Sunday Natasha and Meaghan left for Natasha's cottage I wish I could go but I've been busy helping my parents get ready to start Fix A Leak (our family business). But on Sunday I went to Steph's for a bit which was alright. We were on the computer a bit and made up a few story's about what will never happen to our band that doesn't really exist ^^. But anyway, I went there we ate hotdog's for dinner and then we played Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker. Dude that's such a cute yet somehow fun game! Funniest part of my time with her was when I was doing the voices for the characters and I went from really deep acsent to hot guy sounding. She just cracked up laughing and I couldn't do it again.  When my parents came home from the restaurant they picked me up and I went to bed. The next few days were what I would call breah. Monday was the worst I have never been that depressed in my life. My mom and I had to walk to the dentists and back, and on the way back I just broke down and started to cry. Yes I already missed Natasha and so many jumbled thoughts and emotions I hold in just burst and I cried for an hour or something. On Tuesday I started getting a fever and that's when the sleeping problem took effect. I Haven't slept since then. So I haven't slept Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Hopefully I can sleep tonight. I'm like a wide-eyed something! I just got my internet back yesturday but I was busy watching Signs with Mike so I couldn't go on. So the only really fun part of this week was going to see Pirates of the Caribean with my parents, my Mom thought it was boring but me and my Dad thought it was a great movie. I love Johnny Depp he's a really great actor. And PotC was an amazing movie couldn't get it out of my head. Till Final Fantasy 7 kicked back into an addiction. Vincent! *drools* Mike volunteered to help me beat it and I might take him up on his offer. Anyway, this week has been an utter borefest. Hope next week il be better!"

"event","My last update was March 20th woah dude... That was March Break or the week after who cares. The interesting things that happened that would be highly memorial for me would have to be that one day when we were playing headless horsemen (rules: pull something over your head like a jacket or something... and you have to catch the other person) Well I was it (I have noticed something I'm always it...) And I first almost walked into a pole following their voices then Jix told Megi to push me into a puddle. Jix thought that Meg would only push me lightly but unfortunately I slipped fell got the back of my legs and butt soaked!!!!! And I was really PISSED off!!!! Well for a bit, I mean who wants to be pushed into a puddle and have very wet underwear that was sick especially since it was a horrid brown colour. I mean...I'll shut up now about that. Then we had gym after that and that was horrible because I didn't have a change so I was walking around with wet wet clothes! 

Next event! Well I kinda got Meg mad by sitting on her. That's when she went inside. Holly came out and I shoved hay/straw/grass whatever into her shirt which caused absolute MAYHEM! No really Jix, Gui, Holly, and Aimee came after me with hay/straw grass and started shoving it down my shirt. By the time they were down I had a very clear hump on my back. I was a camel ^^. No but with this experience I was laughing it was quite entertaining for me and for them. Only things bad were that Meg came back and kicked me a few times and I had hay/straw/ grass in more places then I can remember. 

The anime con!- The wonders of anime conventions... First off we didn't know where anything was (present at this event were Jix, Meg, Holly and Van [which is me Kaghoulya]) Then we found the animes showing that was alright if I knew what was going on! See I have glasses I just don't know where they are. We after awhile found what we were looking for which was hard. Because some lady said nothing going on down there. But oh there was! (OHH I forgot to mention DDR Dance Dance Revolution! That one asian guy was awesome I admire him!) But when we finally went back down there the buying began (let's see if I can remember) I bought a Neon Genesis Evangelion Groundwork book a few poster of Van Fanel ^^ Tasuke (I don't remember how to spell it from Fushigi Yuugi) Another psoter and a really big poster of Sesshoumaru-sama! Jix bought tarot cards a Naruto poster (I bought it first then she bought it so I thought why have the same so I bought Sess) and I also gave her an Inuyasha friends poster (I forget what else. And don't know what the other people got) But it was a really good day it introduced us to Onegai Teacher which was a good anime the best I think we saw there.

My Birthday April 7th- YAHHH! Gui was the first to arrive with her guitar and she started to play beheaded. Jix then arrived followed by Meg. Then very much later Christina then VERY MUCH LATER Cran! So let's see here I got The Lord of the Rings soundtrack the next day at school by Gui. Jix gave me my favourite gift Blood: The Last Vampire and two(bead) lizards hanging over my bed at this moment. Meaghan gave me a Shoenen jump manga. Christina and her family gave me a fishing rod (no idea what inspired this but happy none the less) -_- Cran gave me the Princess Mononoke Dvd whioch I already so I traded it in for a Rammstein Cd YEAH! We made Vincenzo watch Harry Potter along with many other movies. Oh yeah it was my 14th birthday.

Ottawa - The amazing trip to Ottawa with the two classes in a couch bus with sharing a CD player. A six hour bus ride! YABBbb! We got there yaah! We went to the museum of civilization yah! We went bowling and the teachers found a side of me that they never thought possible. (The teachers thought I was a very shy quiet kid...THEY WERE WRONG! OH SO VERY WRONG!) Well I started screaming when anyone on my team threw the ball down the bowling lanes. Even if it's a gutter bowl. After a little while we created the dance! Where we do the little hand sign ummm \__/ something like that (means rock on or something) And we put our hands in front of us and swayed our hips at the same time. And when they hit the gutter or hit the pins we would scream! Yell shout! Be happy Hyper! YOOOO! We got back to the hotel got dress into our pajamas I couldn't bring my rags.... Then the fire alarm went off! Well Call me a retard I was the only one in our room (Jix, Meg, Gui) who forgot to put on shoes -_-. We went outside it was wet the stones were sharp and pointy! Everyone was wearing there pajamas (some guys were shirtless *shudder*) And one girl was wearing a towel (poor poor her)Well I was wearing one of those long types of night thing a ma jigs. So a guy thought I was wearing nothing under it... Thank god I was my lucky shorts. 

2nd day - Museums and things it was great this day. We went on a boat/dance where I met well stocked the long haired blonde hot thing of *drools* Christoph... I will always remember you. 

3rd day - We went to the art museum one of the best  museums  that we went to! We drove home I lost in the historicly challenged. I suck...but that's okay! We got home and I was glad but somehow I didn't want that trip to end.

That is it and I warn all who read my journal now MY internet is down! (the system is down...ba ba ba ba badababa)

Jix and I spent three days with my grandparents in Englewood Florida where we went to the beach and swam. We spent another 3 days in Sarasota Florida with my other grandparents where we mostly played games and watched t.v.

We took off from Orlando to Charlotte on the 3rd of March and Charlotte to Buffalo. In the Charlotte airport we saw this lady with an adorable dog. It had such cute ears!

We had four days of school then March break. Unfortunately, our March Break was very boring. We spent most of it doing our homework only a few days were spent for fun. We slept over at Megi's on the Wednesday where we watched the Matrix and Feardotcom. I loved the matrix it was so cool!

Tomorrow Authors day is coming up so most of the day we get free time. I look forward to the weekend! It seemed this week like it would never come. On Saturday my mom is holding a Spring party where we get to eat ole bollen (Dutch food...I'm dutch...kinda) The next big things to look forward to is my birthday. April 7th! Then Easter, then we have to wait for the Ottawa trip and finally the best part SUMMER!"

For Christmas I got two video games (Dead or Alive 3 and Metroid Prime) a dvd (Spider-man) a black zip-up sweater with a hood, a stuffed 4 foot long snake, a stuffed bear, a christmas singer dalmation hand puppet, and some other stuff.

But I only have a month and a day of school before I go to Florida with Jix and my parents. We go on the 19th and get back the 4th. We're going to find shark teeth and sea shells. Use mine and my brothers sand shovel's and search for those white sea thingy's. Two day's at a theme park of our choice. I'm thinking we go to disney! Space Mountain! After that my parents leave to Long Beach California and we go to see my grand parents. Where we will go to the beach swim and other stuff! =^._.^= I'll miss my evil cat Sassy and Jix will miss Howard but it's really enjoyable there and plus...NO SCHOOL!!!

"event","Well today had to be the longest most boring school days I can remember. Let's see we started out with English read a story called Was it Murder? I was half listening. It droned on and on and got me utterly pissed. Then all around me ""I think she's guilty!"" A worksheet went around I just kinda looked at it and picked up my book. Circle of light, darkness and fire by Tanya Huff. Next two classes Science and Math. We took up our sciences tests and I read go me! Math took up work I read and marked yeah! Math had to be the longest friggin period there was. I ate at Jix's that was fun one of the most interesting parts of the day. Then we had French I wanted to read but couldn't since our French teachers a bitch. So I found out i'm in a group with Cooper which is good. Then came Music the class of utter hell the class which gives you the largest headache ever. The class watched a movie which they couldn't hear and I. Guess what I did? You probably got it right! That's right i read! Let's see next was a strange recess a guy got kicked in the balls *Uh painful!* he was down for awhile. Mona did somersaults in the snow. And like everything else it went on forever. Then the eventfulness of Art that was suppose to be gym! Most people did Art I read have listened to Mike talk to me which is uncommon now-a-days and listened to Christina say What? alot. I'm nearly done the first part of the book yeah! Then finally we got our report cards and I went to Jix's till about 5:45 we played Kingdom Hearts! Great game I like it alot. I can't have it though since I don't have PS2. Oh the irony lol. My friends have it so its all good. After all that game watching I went home watched Simpsons with my brother listened to him lecture me before going to work and then I got on to finish chapter 12 in my story on Fanfiction.net.  <a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=1058206""> If you want to check it out here it is but beware it has expicit content!

"event","It was a strange week on Thursday I think two new kids came into are class Kyle and Sheldon, Sheldon being from England. As the day progressed we found out Sheldon was quite perverted and had fun hugging girls pinching there butts sitting on there laps. Friday I got hugged by Sheldon cause John W wanted to get back at me. Me and Jix went to Cran's house after school for Corrado's birthday! We played monopoly and whoever lost had to kiss Cran. He has a crush on me but I don't like him we've been friends for so long hes like my brother. It didn't bother me kissing him brothers and sisters can kiss right? Even though hes not my brother thats just how I think of him. I had a strange dream last night though. I was in a stunt plane and I fell and someone grabbed my hand. I woke up at that moment so I don't know who it was. 

Today I finished off most of my art and then I went to Natasha's where I met with my other friends Guitheflea and Megi_Chan. We watched Rurouni Kenshin then stephanie had to go. Megi_chan drew Gri from invader Zim. He's so awesome. Afterwards we played monopoly and put something on the line. If I lost I had to go out with Cran for a week if Megi_Chan lost she would have to ask Jedi_and out for a week and if Jix lost she'd have to ask out Spooky_donkey.  

Right now I feel like leaving you guys some poetry have fun with it.

Is that so Much?

Now I'm sitting in my room
Crying softly with the door locked
Seems that I always find myself crying 

You would call me weak
And sneer at me with disgust
I suppose I am weak
I grew up thinking I was 

You swear and curse in anger
For something I didn't even do
Yet already,
I feel guilty 

Can't have your way,
you say
It's not always about you 

Well, I'm sorry
But all I want to do is live a life
Is that so much? 

You say I didn't do anything to help
But yet,
I didn't hear you ask for any
I thought you had it under control
You told me what to do
and I did them 

Now I just want my own time
And yet,
even that seems too much to ask

Think you know me? Think again!

you think you know me
very well
but from what i see
i can surely tell
what you think you know
isn't really true
if you go deep down inside
you'll discover
everything i keep from you,
everything i hide,
everything i cover,
no one can deny
that the only thing
i wanna do
is just sit and rot and keep everything away from you.

Fooling myself

Lookin' in the mirror,
I see my smiling face
This face that fools everybody 

Call myself a clown
Cuz that's really what I am
With that moronic grin,
and idiotic jokes
I can fool anyone 

I think it's better this way
That no one knows the real me
The me who longs to be alone,
drown in my own little world. 

The me that cries myself to sleep
Inside, I'm teared apart
Broken and bruised
No longer able to be healed. 

But it's good that no one knows
the real me
They don't want my problems
I'd be burdening them, right? 

So it's good that I'm able to fool them
So that they don't have even a second glance at ""me""
I can fool them so.. 

I'll wear this mask forever
And maybe
Just maybe


I'll be able to fool myself


Well I have to go to bed now so I'll leave you at that! Night!"

"event","Well yesturday, It was the first day of school since we had Monday off. The day was rather boring art saved me though thank god for art! Me and my parents and brother went to my grandparents after school for a second thanksgiving. The apple sauce and mashed potatoes were great. Afterwards I had to do my homework. I had fogotten my science at my house so I had to do my history and finish off another drawing project. Then it was time for a family competition of dominos. My brother won he always wins at games but afterwards I beat him up ^_^. Thats when the drawing contest started...he didn't win. 

  Today its Wednesday and its not a really good day for me. I really hate this day. It was alright then we found out we had a gym test and a science test and all that junk. I went to Jix's cause thats what I do everyday. I love going to Jix's house theres so much to do there! Then I got picked up and found out I had to go to Crans house...well I found that out after lets see six o clock. So we went for the occasion of Lara's birthday (crans mom) and cran wouldn't let me use the computer till I was done my homework. I finished my homework and talked to Jix and told her about what happened then cran said that it wasn't true and now I think she thinked I lied. Now i'm sad and slightly tired not a good combination. I hope she does good on the science test! I'm rooting for you Jix! I believe you can do it! At least after saying this i'm a little happier. Oh, and it was slightly freaky this morning thats when I knew something was going to be wrong. I woke up and couldn't open my eyes and they weren't black either they were red and there was a black dot in the middle so it kinda looked like a red eye was staring at me. That was strange. I just hope Jix does good on the upcoming tests I know she can."

"event","Well I woke up late again today not as late as yesturday though. I woke up around ten o clock. My mom woke me up becuase my brother had not come home and he was suppose to turn off the internet and my parents don't know how. I then ate my breakfast which consisted of a cold strip of bacon and Muslix the fibre cereal(yum...almonds) After breakfast Jix called and asked if we could do our homework together. I was happy but first I had to take a shower and draw some more on my wall. Now I have Ryudo,Elena,Millenia,Vyse,Aika,Carro,Gao and Blue. All rpg character's if you wanted to know. ^_^ Then it was time to go to Jix's. I went over and she did her math while I did my english it was quite fun I enjoyed the words crocker sacks and chinking (hehe chinking) After that We watched the first episode of Noir,Nurato, and Boogiepop Phantom. I liked them all but I took aliking to both Noir and Nurato. Those were awesome but boogiepop phantom was great too. After that we went for a search of sites to find awesome anime pics. Anyone know a good site to find cool anime pics? Then I had to go home for my Thanksgiving dinner which consisted of: Turkey, Mini potatoes, beans, carrots, apple sauce and stuffing. (mmm...apple sauce) I watched abit of the Escaflowne movie then we had to eat so I switched to Lord of the Rings. I loved seeing my favourite character Aragorn again (^_^ hehehehehe!) My dad still like's the Cave troll. Now I'm eating some Lemon marage pie or whatever. With some vanilla ice cream. (SUGAR!!!) Then I think were all going to watch a comedy together, I don't know which one but oh well. You people can always give me new drawing ideas. The ideas are always welcome!"

"event","Well my day wasn't to exciting. To tell you the truth I slept till three o clock then drew for an hour...That was fun I made up a girl called Sytina and wanted to do something so I drew the powerpuff girls anime style that was fun. But Mojo jo jo didn't turn out to good neither did mr. ameoba but thats ok. Ace and the powerpuff girls turned out great so did Sytina. Well after I drew those pictures I got tired again so I went back to bed I woke up around five I think. Thats when I had my lunch a banana and my pill. My parents weren't home they went to home depot so I went downstairs and reveiewed Jix's lj then my brother came in (Rick) So I went upstairs and drew somemore I finished of Cybia then I was forced to do some of my homework (NO!!!!) Right now i'm hyper because I slept most of the day and I didn't feel like eating much I just had some shrimp and some apple sauce (last time I couldn't eat my apple sauce because I gagged it up but I LOVE APPLE SAUCE!) Thats most of what happened today boring huh? Well not to me I find nothing boring...I'm surprised when I'm bored. Oh right now I'm watching Red October it's a war movie. I'm surprised becuase I laughed when a guy died... Maybe cause of seen this movie way to many times...I just like the captain of the Red October hes cool. Hes insane lol, He's really smart to. Well anyway I'll get back to drawing. I hope you had a good meal Jix! Who should I draw...Anyone got any ideas I like ideas tell me if you know what I should draw!"

"event","Well it started off pretty normal I woke up then fell back to sleep which, well usually doesn't happen. I woke up again then I started to draw. I drew two pictures the Elemental mistress sheet two and Omi for Jix. Thats when things got really wierd I started running around the house at full speeds a smile on my face. Megi_Chan called afterwards and asked me to come over with Jix my parents let me so I was even happier so I ran around the house agian. I ran downstairs and started to take a shower...feeling very refreshed my hyperness went down a little. I ate the last two eggo's then got a call from Jix that she was going to pick me up. I got yper again and started running around the room. When Jix came we took a look at what my parents had done with the backyard (We have no grass!) Then off we went to Megi_Chan's.

   Unfortunatly, we got lost and had to go back to Jix's house to call Megi_chan and find out directions to her house. We got there and went straight up to the computer we chatted on it for a bit then I snuck off to Megi_chan's room. A RAID! no it wasn't a raid I just kinda....took out all her drawing and looked at them all, most of them in awe. Jix came in and Megi_chan stayed in the computer room. Jix started to draw, I started to read and Megi_chan was talking to her 'good friend' Jedi-and. We decided to go see My Big Fat Greek Wedding, it would be mine and Jix's second time to see it. We ate hamburger for supper then off we went to the movies.

   At the movies, I got a reel deal whcih was a large popcorn and a large drink (mmm...Coke) Anyway I caught sight of the preps so Jix and I ran into the theatre. It was awesome we were the first ones in there and we got the best seats (SCORE!!!) Megi_chan and her sister and her sisters friend came in awhile later. A guy sitting behind us asked us if we wanted some chocolate raisins...It was different then we started to laugh and he said it wasn't funny because he had dropped them on the floor. The movie started and the laughing went on for the whole movie, well just the really funny parts. I ate 1 and 3 /4 bags of popcorn that was good. My favourtie part is when the greek grandmother walks out of the house in a funny sort of way and the sprinklers go on soaking her. 

   Afterwards Megi_Chan and I sleptover at Jix's. She made my awesome layout! Isn't awesome! You better think so...We looked for this spanish song that was really cool that I heard in Holland. It took us awhile but we found it and now we know the dance off by heart. We went downstairs to see what movies were on the t.v the only good movie was on at 3 in the morning. We watched some cooking shows then Jix found HardBall the movie about the baseball team. I cried my eyes out its so sad. That kept me awake for awhile. It ended at about 2 so we only had an hour left we decided to sleep so we set the alarm clock and went to bed. Well we missed the alarm and woke up at 7 to bad I wanted to watch crouching tiger hidden dragon. 

   We went back up to the computer and Jix did a layout for Asawaki which looked great. Everything Jix does looks great! We spent a few hours on the computer then went out yo rent a game. We had to take Jix's dog Howard with us (He's so CUTE!!!) I got knocked down by Howard and my pants got stainded but meh. We rented a game called Epmeharal Fantasia which was really strange...kinda fun kinda boring. After awhile of playing that Megi_Chan had to leave we went back to playing but, stopped and went back on the computer. We mostly listened to music and played on neopets which was fun. Jix had to go to her cousins for Thanksgiving I hope she has a great time. Thats when I had to leave. I came home and drew another picture I think I'm gonna call her Youmi what do you guys think? Well my life goes on so you'll read more about my strange life tomorrow."

"event","Well today was mostly boring the morning was not very eventful. Three buses picked us up to go to Firemen's Park. Adam didn't show up so that made me team captain. This young girl on my team kept on hugging my leg once she almost brought my pants down. Thank god I was holding on to the side or I would have got a lot of 'she has white underwear' well they wouldn't really see it they'd see my lucky rag shorts.^_^ We went through a few boring games that I didn't participate in then went off to lunch. 

Lunch was alright until the swarm came...the swarm of losers. It started with John, then came Jesse, then the mosquito that won't leave you alone,Stephanie. I managed to get her away for alittle bit by chucking her lunch bag down the hill.The little kids helped us out by grabbing it and running off with it. She just came back and began to screech at John...The attack of the screeching mosquito! Oh yeah my dad packed my lunch for those of you who don't know my dads insane with packing. I got two pizza buns, two Gatorade bottles red and orange,and a whole bag of Dill pickle chips.All of which were gone by the end of the day.

After lunch it was alright I got to participate a little more. I think Jeremy V. has a thing for me. See before this year he'd never smile at me now this year he always smiles when I look at him not his usual smile a strange smile, but I could be wrong my imagination does that some times. The best activity was the parachute! Yeah! Jeremy V. was beside me for that with that same smile and his cute little laughing.  

The ending ceremonies scared me we had to sing that horrid Orchard Park song that goes with the melody of its a small world after all. Jessica told me she didn't like Christina and Christina told me she was trying to piss off Jessica...what a pair. Then all the guys went down to play football Matt got injured poor Matt, he couldn't even walk, hes also being nicer to me yeah! Katie W. got a nose bleed lol, I shouldn't laugh but its funny, I don't like her. Then the walk home came which took forever, more then a half an hour. I talked to Mr.Ellis a bit about my brother and the Buffalo Sabres and stuff. Then I ran up beside Megi and Mona and Mona asked where my house was. I made up a joke since everyone was dying of thirst. Free water at my house! no one heard though or a stampede of students would have knocked me over. Thats when I saw my mom and most kids pleaded me to take them home with me so they didn't have to work anymore. I had to pick up Jix's homework so I walked with them and now I can barely walk from so much pain in my feet. Then I went to Jix's house to drop off her homework and see how she was feeling. She looked alright so that made me happy.

Then I got home sat down and drank and drank and drank some more. I then sat down to draw, I came up with a new character called Elemental Mistress shes cool. My grandparents came over and we talked for awhile then I went back to drawing. I ate spaghetti for dinner that was good mmmmm....Thats how that day strange but fun none the less."

"event","My cat, Kaktus, sheds a lot. He's 9 years old - will be 10 this spring. He's a calm and cuddly old cat. Never moves much. My partner and I usually joke that &quot;Whoah careful there, you wouldn't want to strain yourself!&quot; Whenever he gets up, to lie down in a different position. But yeah, he sheds a lot. In the morning he comes up to me in the bed and cuddles next to my pillow. His purring reverberates throughout the mattress and can be heard no matter how you lie with your head. It has a very calming effect on me. But he sheds - which leads to frequent changes of bed linens. And that's okay.

I adopted Kaktus and the one year younger Taktur from a friend of mine, who couldn't take them to where she was moving. They are indoor cats, and considering how much they shed I've been wondering why we've never seen a single furball coughed up. And we haven't. Ever.

Until today. 

Poor kitty. Both of the cats talk. Taktur talks considerably more than Kaktus, but lately Kaktus has become more vocal as well. I've gotten used to the sounds, and I have learned to discern Taktur's morning call of &quot;There's no more food in the bowl, get your ass out of bed and feed me!&quot; from his &quot;I'm cranky because Kaktus took my chair. Comfort me by giving me more attention!&quot; Similarly I have learned to discern Kaktus' &quot;I'm feeling cuddly, is there roo for me in the bed/couch?&quot; from his &quot;Taktur's being a bully, and I'm tired of staring him down, poor meeee.&quot;

And this afternoon, suddenly I heard Kaktus say something I'd never heard before. It was the most unhappy, desperate plea I'd ever heard him utter. He sounded completely miserable. I was sitting on the couch with a bowl of yoghurt and cereal, so I just had to put that on the table. And doing that, I heard the follow up sound coming from out by the front door. The unmistakable sound of hurling. And yep, when I got there I just saw poor Kaktus get rid of the last of his puke. He looked up and me and had an apology written all over his face. He was so miserable. And the brave little kitty had been so considerate as to puke on the door mat, so it was easy for me to just dump it in the shower and wash it. I don't know if he intended for that, but I do think he's more intelligent than he lets on.

And he's just been sitting around, not touching food for the last two hours now. I've only had him since September, so I don't know if he's ever had to puke to pass a furball before (and yes, there was a furball in there). I just know that I'll pribably never forget the sound he made just before he puked. He sounded so heart-broken it nearly broke mine."

"event","...ought to have their driver's license revoked.

I got home from running a few errands just now and drove into the parking lot next to my building. I did see that another car was leaving the parking lot next to the one I'd entered. I thought it would be leaving the way I'd come. So I enter the parking lot, and I drive slowly because I'm used to kids playing there. I kept to the right because I was aiming to get a spot to my left, and admittedly I did not look in my rear view mirror, so I didn't see anything. This side of the parking lot was empty, so I could just pick and choose the spot I wanted, I did and as I turned left I sudenly see that other car coming up next to me on my left. 

Goddammit!

I stepped on the brakes and the woman in the car gave ME a very angry look as SHE drove across the marked parking spots passing me only to exit the parking lot while I was still sitting there rather shocked at what the moron did.

A parking lot for fuck's sake! People usually go there to park. Don't tell me you're surprised I turned my car towards a spot designated for parking. Don't tell me you're surprised I meant to park along the marked lines. As opposed to driving across them, you fuckwit!

Damn.

I just needed to vent. What an idiot. And she had the nerve to look angrily at me, as if I'm the one driving outside the lanes, being too impatient to wait for them to park and instead overtake them disregarding that they may actually be trying to park where I intend to drive.

ARGH

"event","It's early February. The weather ought to be cold and wet, possibly even with heavy snows. But no. We have high sun and it's actually fairly warm. 14 degrees Celsius is nice, and I decided to go spend some time writing on a bench in the park. As it turned out the wind was a tad too cold for it to be really comfortable, but just as I was concocting parts of my next blog entry there were sirens. Sitting between seven 11+ story buildings it was difficult for me to pin-point where the hell they were coming from. I shrugged it off and figured they would pass by on the main street nearby soon thereafter.

But no. Suddenly I could hear exactly where they were coming from. Approximately at the same time as a little boy shouted ""Look! A firetruck!"" the sound could pass directly from the source to my ears inbetween the buildings, and bloody hell they were right next to one of the apartment blocks. Not mine, thankfully. I got my things and went over there to see what the hell was going on, and as more came into view it was the whole shebang. Engine, ladder, water tank parked beneath the building where smoke was wafting from a flat on the 6th floor (I think it was). It wasn't much smoke, thankfully, so it probably wasn't a real bad fire, but bad enough to be noticable from the outside, because no one had been home. That was pretty clear from the fact that&nbsp; the fire fighters removed a little dog from the flat, but no one else. The poor creature was shaking and very scared. 

The trucks left just now and I've been reminded of my childhood ambition of becoming a fire fighter :P"

"event","In the bus on my way home today, I saw the blind man and his black lab guide dog. I see him quite often on the bus routes I use. He usually sits in the front seat. Today at the central station, it was after 5 PM, and by then there's a bus every hour instead of every 20 minutes. That means the bus fills up more than usual. There were still plenty of empty seats in the back, I counted at least 10. 

Anyway, I had found a seat towards the back of the bus, and was just sitting there waiting for the clock to show 18:10 so we could leave the station. Sitting there I had plenty of opportunity to observe my fellow passengers. Among them an old lady, she looked older than 60 but younger than my granma who's 85, who got on the bus and asked the blind man if she could sit next to him.

Now, this may not seem so strange in a bus that's slowly becoming packed. But here's the kicker. The seats are two and two, the regular bus kind. There isn't much leg room, and not much room under the seats either. The man had a dog, remember? Big black lab. The dog was sitting on the floor in fron of the window seat and the man sat on the aisle seat, thus blocking two seats, which is perfectly fine, and totally allowed because you know... people do need to have their dogs with them, especially blind people who depend on a guide dog. 

But this lady was pretty much trying to squeeze her way past the man into the window seat next to him, while asking him if she could take that seat. Waiting for an answer? Nope. The man asked her: where should I sit then? And she replied, something to the effect of ""right where you are"". It was as if she hadn't even seen his dog. And geez...

The man got up and she immediately tried to mosey into the window seat, but nearly stepped on the dog that the man had to get out of there first. The man, and remember he's blind - or at least with bad enough eye sight to require a guide dog - just stands there helpless trying to lock in on two empty seats in the bus. Two because the dog needs to be there, too. And believe me, there really isn't room for a dog much larger than a big Jack Russell under those seats, much less a lab. And then a girl, I guess she was 16 or thereabouts gets up and offers him the seat she'd been occupying. There was an empty seat next to her, so he'd have the room for is dog that he needed. And she goes to sit next to the old lady.

The girl had been sitting RIGHT BEHIND HIM all the time. The old lady could just as easily have moved two short steps further down the aisle and sat down next to the girl, but noooo she absolutely had to have the seat the man and his dog were occupying.

Excuse me but: what the fucking fuck? I seem to recall the elderly complaining how young people nowadays don't have any manners blah blah blah. Well whaddaya know, perhaps we learned that from our grannies. Or then again, perhaps some old people are so full of entitlement bullshit that they forget to actually look at reality. The man was BLIND, and the lady has to chase him out of his seat, practically forcing her way past and over him. I was so appalled, is this the generation that claims mine has no manners? I beg to differ. That girl, though she was younger than me I consider her my own generation, was considerably more considerate than that old harpy.

I dunno what that goes to show, but I needed to vent my outrage. Plenty of times have I seen people get up and offer their seats to the blind man, or to people who are obviously not walking all that well. In the first days after I injured my foot and was limping badly there were people offering me - a young, otherwise healthy-looking person - their seat. Some of them were people who were much older than me, I wasn't too pleased about feeling like a cripple who needed extra help, but I was damn grateful that they let me have a seat, when all I wanted was a bed, a blanket, and a good solid bout of swearing.

And this? This just takes the biscuit. A blind man hounded out of his seat because some old woman has decided that she wants that seat and none other.

Bah! I say."

The exact same movements, the exact same mimicry. It's difficult to describe exactly what it is, but this dog, though much bigger, was so similar to Kian in mannerisms. It's scary. I wonder if it really is a terrier thing, or if it's just two dogs that coincidentally are very similar."

"event","On Friday I was involved in an accident at work. I was picking wares in the narrow aisle storage and I arranged with the narrow aisle turret truck driver to be in the same aisle. It was even her idea that I go down in the aisle she was working in, I had originally meant to wait for her to finish. But I went down there on her suggestion, she'd wait for me to finish instead. 5 minutes later she'd forgotten. I was standing between my pallet and my own truck when she drove into the aisle and pushed the pallet into my foot, getting it stuck between said pallet and my truck. 

I screamed. Partly because it hurt like fuck, partly because I was panicking.

Thankfully, she heard me and stopped the truck and hurried out of the aisle. I was still stuck between the 150+ kilo pallet and my 4-ton truck. And neither were budging. Others came running to. First person on the scene was T, who first went to me to help me. I told him (or more like shouted in my panicky state) to move my truck, which he did so I could get my foot free. He heped me to sit down and took my shoe and sock off to check if there was anything to be done here and now ie. bleeding that needed to be stopped.

B showed up with an empty pallet and drove me to the office where the first aid kit is. An ice bag was applied to my foot which was turning blue and black. Transportation to the hospital was arranged for and then I could just sit there and wait. It would be a regular car, since this was hardly enough of an emergency to call for an ambulance. 

After about 30 minutes my transport arrived and once again I was driven through the warehouse on a pallet to the gate where the car was parked. And in all the pain I had a stroke of luck. The man I've been crushing on was the one to help on and off the pallet and to the car. I know next to nothing about him, but I find him extremely appealing for some reason, and leaning heavily on him I had myself a nice grope hehe. I would've liked to hang onto him a while longer but I was heading to the ER, besides there were too many people around for what I would really have liked to do anyway. *cheeky grin*

I was brought to the ER, was put to bed, got a new ice bag and then I could just lay there waiting. I wasn't an emergency so those who came in with ambulances obviously had priority. I wasn't exactly dying. It just hurt like fuck. At first I refused the nurse's offer of pain meds, but eventually she convinced me to take them. It didn't help all that much, but it was a slight relief. 

After almost an hour and a half the doctor came to see me. Dr. Safar, cute young doc, probably of Middle-Eastern descent judging from looks, accent and name. Yum. He examined my foot with the usual ""does it hurt when I press here""-routine, and then sent me to x-ray. There was more waiting there, and I needed to pee. But I was just lying on my hospital bed not knowing where the nearest toilet was, nor how much longer I actually would have to wait before it was my turn. So I couldn't really leave. Finally it was my turn. 

The radiologist was also of Middle-Eastern or Balkan descent, though this man was probably around 50, so not so cute. It must be a thankless job to be a radiologist, having to twist patients' limbs into rather uncomfortable positions in order to get the right angles for the pictures. So I was sitting there, in pain and looking like shat out apple stew as we say around these parts, and when he was done he called for a porter to take a beautiful young lass back to the ER to see the doc who attended her. Any idiot could tell that beautiful was probably the last adjective that could truthfully be applied to me then and there, but it was heart-warming nonetheless. Some might think it was just a pervy old man being leery and lecherous, but his kind smile and the comforting humour in his eyes contradict such suspicions. He was a very professional doctor who knew that&nbsp; harmless and somewhat silly little compliments presented with humour can be just the thing a worried ER patient needs. It sure made me feel better. Heck, I knew I looked like something the cat had dragged in and proceeded to chew on for quite some time, and it was a real nice gesture.

I was taken back down to the ER, where Dr. Safar had had a look at my x-rays and had found nothing to be broken or otherwise displaced. The pain from having my foot squeezed would probably last me a while, and he gave me instructions on how to care for my sprained ankle - nothing much I didn't already know, I've sprained ankles, wrists and fingers regularly on my path through life. I can go back to work when I can do so without causing myself any pain, that was his final judgement. Then a nurse gave me a tetanus shot, which I haven't had since I was 3 or so, and forgot to mention that there'd be some pain from that for some days. So I didn't think it'd matter in which side she shot me up with the vaccine, I thought it'd be like any other vaccine. So she picked the side where she was standing, obviously. That was my right side - it was administered in the upper arm - and that was that, I thought. Until at night when I lay down to sleep, intending to sleep on my right side so's to prevent my right foot from lying on top of my injured left foot. But that was impossible because that tetanus shot hurts like fuck, still. There's obviously a process going on beneath the skin, but wow it hurts. Sort of like a bruise only deeper down. I'd have liked to know that.

Ah well, the nurse also bandaged my foot and 20 minutes after the shot was administered I was allowed to leave the premises. My employer's subscription to patient transportation ensured that I could get a cab home on their bill, rather than having to take the bus. That would've been a pain, since they didn't give me crutches. The doctor explained that crutches allow the sprained ankle to hang limp in the ligaments that were injured and thereby slow the healing process, so it makes sense to not hand them out. But because of the cushing injury to my forefoot I couldn't support my weight on my foot at all, so I did a lot of limping and hopping on one leg. But at least I hadn't broken anything.

I was home by 4.45 in the afternoon. Very tired and all cried out. Called my folks informed them of what had happened, and I called my friend M and informed him as well. I'm not on prescription pain meds, but I was told I should just take what I normally take if I felt it was necessary. Saturday morning I did, but they don't make much of a difference, and as it turned out, the foot hurs more the longer I've been sitting still with it. So it appears the trick is to keep moving it, excercising the ankle. It hurts like fuck in the morning, and I wouldn't want to attempt climbing into my truck, but gimme a week's time or so and I should be able to go back to work, unless I have seriously misjudged how fast this will heal. The doc would probably recommend a longer recuperation time, but I usually heal pretty fast and if I can get tasks that won't require me to climb in and out of the truck all the time, all day I should be fine. But we'll see.

Once I return to work I'll also have to fill out a report of the work injury, so if I get complications later on related to this injury it won't count as normal sickness but will be on the work injury 'budget'. 

But wow, what a day. And what a shock. Come Sunday I'd gotten over the shock, and today I've come to a point where I'm fairly settled down about it all. The doc was confident there'd be no lasting damage.

Though the black and blue-ness of the initial injury is long since disipated, the blood from the burst cappilaries did have to go somewhere. It spread out in my foot so from the damaged area and all the way out to my toes my left has taken on a light blue-ish colour, loking mostly like it's very cold and close to developing frost-bite. Looks freaky, but it's nothing to worry about, I've seen displaced bruises before hehe.

For now, I'm trying to enjoy a few extra days off without the joy of being able to go anywhere. *growl* I get bored easily when I don't have the option of leaving my home, and I get very impatient when I can't walk very fast - a graceless hobble is all I can manage without any pain - and so I end up trying to walk faster and then end up hurting myself. And knowing me I'm more likely to just ignore the pain and keep walking, so I better not start doing that at all. I'll just end up making things worse. So I'm sitting on my couch, frustrated that I can't do much of anything useful."

The Codex Alimentarius Commission is the World Health Organisation and United Nations working with the World Trade Organisation and pharmaceutical companies and banks to control food standards. The WTO and pharmaceutical companies and banks, as you may have guessed, have no interest in protecting the consumer. They control things like the level of pesticides in food that are acceptable, which antibiotics/steroids/growth hormones can be fed to animals intended for consumption, guidelines for vitamins &amp; minerals, some labelling of food.<br /><br />According to the Codex Alimentarius, vitamins and minerals are now classed as ""toxins"", and as such we must be protected from them. Do you or anyone you know have the desire to be protected from vitamin C? Under their guidelines, any amount of vitamin/mineral/herb that produces a noticeable effect on someone's wellbeing will be forbidden (For example, Vitamin C over 200mg). I thought the point of nutrients was that they produced a noticeable effect, no? And since when were NUTRIENTS (essential for life and functioning etc) classed as toxins? Obviously too much of anything is toxic (even water), and there are limits, but shouldn't that make either ALL food and drink toxins, or NONE?<br /><br />Under the Codex Alimentarius ALL cattle will be given growth hormones, and antibiotics. ALL animals intended for consumption will be given antibiotics. ALL meat intended for consumption will be irradiated. That includes ""organic"" food.<br /><br />Under the Codex Alimentarius, any GMO will not require a label, so you will not know whether you are eating genetically modified plants or not.<br /><br />Any country that does not follow the Codex Alimentarius guidelines will have massive trade sanctions imposed on it. Britain is definitely going to follow them, as is America, and most of Europe. It supersedes all laws the countries have on food standards, and will reduce our access to information about the food we eat. It will effectively gut the alternative medicine industry, and deprive people of options. Any nutrient or herb over a certain dose will either be illegal, or have to be bought at grossly inflated prices on prescription from pharmaceutical companies.<br /><br />This will come into effect in 2009, and it's been worked towards for over 40 years. If you're not worried... well, you should be.<br /><br />I do not know everything about the Codex Alimentarius, and don't claim to. I'm just sharing some stuff that I only stumbled across in the last couple of days. I think people have a right to know what's going on with their food and health. I certainly want to know what's being done to my food, and if any of my healthcare options are being taken away from me. It may seem like I'm talking about some sort grossly exaggerated doomsday theory, but I don't believe I am. You can check all my sources, and help me out if you believe I'm wrong. I just want to know the truth.<br /><br />Here's a European petition about the Codex Alimentarius: <a class=""linkification-ext"" href=""http://www.laleva.cc/petizione/english/intro_eng.html"" title=""Linkification: http://www.laleva.cc/petizione/english/intro_eng.html"">http://www.laleva.cc/petizione/english/intro_eng.html</a><br /><br />Spread this around.  Talk."""

So I was standing there mixing the dough for the pane con prosciutto, and I notice that as always I need 15 grams of yeast. It's always 15 grams, or for larger portions 30. Yet it always comes in packs of 50? Why? I checked my recipes, almost every single one of them uses 15 or 30 grams of yeast. Why te packs of 50? It's so impractical.

I've also been experiementing hehe So I've been writing down a recipe so I can recreate the processif my experiment turns out to be good enough to use again someday.

Hehe impro dinner :D

On another note: it appears to be frosty outside, still. That's good, it means we'll have a clear night sky for the fireworks tonight. W00tness!"

One of the most vocal opponents of Pakistan's military rule has been killed. A proponent of democracy and human rights, speaking up even when faced with threats from government and civilian radicals alike Benazir Bhutto had a great deal of my respect, and I've been following the news about her since she returned to her homeland even though she knew it would be dangerous. She believed she would be more of a help by being right there where her opinions mattered the most.

I don't know if she was right. I hope she was, if not her death will have been in vain. I hope her death will not just be shrugged off as another casualty of political disagreements as happens so often. I hope that the media coverage of Bhutto and her legacy will prevent oblivion from swallowing Pakistan's turmoil, while some fight for democracy and others struggle to keep hold of the power.

It's bloody unbelievable. One of the really great profiles in the fight for democracy and human rights is gone. I hope she will not leave a void, but that others will continue the struggle and not give up.

Shedding a tear for yet another dead soldier, I shall turn in considerably more somber than when I decided to check the news.

News suck, and yet I wouldn't do without them. Else how would anyone know when they were needed to fill a recently opened position? I hear Pakistan's in need of a strong opposition leader, anyone volunteering?"

"event","If I've talked politics or religion with people for a while it's likely that I've let them know I'm a feminist. Some have found that fact surprising, and they usually proced to ask me why. Indeed, why am I a feminist? Simple. I believe women ought to have equal rights and equal standing in our society. Then they usually roll their eyes and say what I was thinking, namely 'duh'. And then they ask what they had actually meant to ask in the first place: ""Do you honestly think it's still necessary?"" To that I can only say: ""Do you honestly have to ask?"" Meaning two things. One: If I didn't think feminism was still necessary, I probably wouldn't be writing and arguing about women's rights under a feminist banner as much as I do, now would I? Two: Look around you, do you honestly thing we've achieved those two things I mentioned?
 
 I found a wonderful example as to why I'm still fighting this battle in the newspaper of December 17th. It's a free newspaper that everyone gets so it doesn't exactly have the really awesome indepth articles (those I'll hi-jack at my folks'), but it has the news and it doesn't pretend to have more than that, so that's cool. Now, let me just point out: I live in Denmark, we may have a right-wing government, but we are far more progressive when it comes to women's rights than for instance the US, which takes up a lot of the writing space when it cmes to feminist issues. We've had legal abortion for several decades, and while there's time-limit as to how late you can have an abortion, it is free for all and it is an integral part of our universal health care system. Not an exception to it. Since the abortion issue is one of the really big ones when it comes to women's rights one would think that when we have that one more or less settled, what other problems could there be here?
 
 The newspaper on December 17th has this:
 Front page headline: Feminine jobs pay considerably less than masculine jobs. Two common jobs are compared, that f a welder and that of a nursing home carer. The educations required for either job are of equal length and yet the difference in pay is: 18 %
 A right-wing politician objects that one cannot compare jobs just like that. He says that the nursing home carer's position comes with certain benefits that are worth quite a lot if translated to currency, and he exemplifies with..... wait for it.... better maternity leave! As if that's something really awesomely fashionably modern. It's a traditional feminine occupation, they have *had* to make decent maternity leave deals because 96 % of their employees are women. 
 
 He also claims that the nursing home carers have a better work environment. Oh really? Well, their work environment is likely a good bit cleaner than the welder's, but better? I don't know about that. It's different. The welder's environment will depend greatly upon where he works. Welding is used in small facilites where one welder will do many different things, welding is also used in large shipyards where the work can be very monotonous, not to mention the level of noise in different work places can be very diverse. Thus, welding is not a uniform thing that can just be compared. What about the carers? Some of them work in the rivate homes of the elderly, that means where stairs are not built for ease of access, where there are no elevators if you need to take the heavy vaccum cleaner with you to the 2nd floor, where there are no aids for lifting a person who has fallen down, where there is a lot of smoke or other things one might be allergic to or that are simply unhealthy. Additionally, having visited family members in nursing homes I have seen just how physically and verbally abusive the 'inmates' in such nursing homes can be. It may not break the carers' bones nor outright kill them like accidents in a shipyard could a welder, but it can break them mentally and it does in many cases. Not to mention the fact that there is a lot of criticism of how these carers do their jobs, even though the allotted time for each task is often ridiculously brief.

This article takes up pages 4 and 5. The wages up for comparison are these:
Welder: Hourly pay including pension: 183.36 DKK
Carer: Hourly pay including pension: 149.78 DKK

And these are also including those additional fees for potentially damaging work environments etc etc

Now, if we compare them including benefits such as paid vacation, maternity/paternity leave and sick leave it look like this:
Welder: 231.27 DKK
Carer: 193.43 DKK

The difference is even bigger! What exactly was this politicians point about the carer's maternity leave being better? It may well be but apparently either the sick leave or the paid vacation cancels it out. What does that tell us? One: that he's wrong about the value of those benefits and two: that apparently benefits such as vacation and leave is worth less when it's a woman needing it.

Besides, the welde can go home in weekends. He might have the opportunity to work weekends and earn extra, but few industries here work all through the weekend. Very few indeed. But the carers? Well, people don't stop needing care just because you want to spend your weekend with your family. Just like hospitals don't close on weekends, for which I'm sure most people are very grateful. So that was one issue.

Headline on page two of this newspaper: Midwives protest.
A hospital has decided to cut funding for their maternity ward. That means less preparatory counselling, which means more fear before giving birth. It means the counselling for parents of a stillborn, the special offers for those pregnant with twins or more, plus counselling for rape and incest victims who are pregnant will all be closed.

Obviously the midwives who are there to give pre as well as post-natal care are unhappy that they cannot have the funds to do their jobs properly, so they have gathered signatures and protest vocally. The director of the hospital is reported to be impressed with the support for the maternity ward but as he says: ""We don't have enough money, so we must prioritize. It's a shame about the pre-natal counselling and I pity those with special needs, but they must look for other options, because we prioritize safety for those giving birth.""

Yeah, 'cause they really need his pity. And they may not be giving birth right now, but in a few months they will, so wha kind of bull was that? And if prioritizing those giving birth means not preparing them properly for the ordeal and therefore causing more to choose epidurals and c-sections that might not have been necessary I really don't want to see what it would be like if they were not prioritized. Ack!

On page 6 a journalist gives his opinion on how the new female head of the Church Ministry has been conspicuously silent when it comes to the issue of some male preachers refusing to shake hands with female preachers, and the story about how the bishop needed several months to decide whether that was acceptable or not. If this church was its own institution they could act however they'd like for all I care. But this church is the one whose employes are paid by the state ad supposedly should have room for everyone, and as long as the state pays their salaries it should bloody well be up to the state to tell them not to discriminate, the journalist writes. This male journalist finds it very disconcerting that the female Secretary of the Church Ministry as not yet said a word on the treatment of female ministers.

I find it very disconcerting that a male journalist reacts to tis discrimination before a female politician does. And this particular politician is usually one of the most loud-mouthed ones who really dare to tell it like it is. Perhaps getting the post as Secretary of a ministry has taken the fight out of her.

On page 9 we find the headline: Porn sells t-shirts

There's not any porn on the t-shirts themselves, but the ad for the site selling the t-shirts has a photo taken from a man's view down at his penis and a woman kneeling in front of him, obviouslyjust about to give him a blowjob. The woman's eyes have been covered with an 'anonymity bar' with the text t-shirtlounge.dk, and the ad text says: ""New t-shirts have cumed""

The advertiser defends his ad saying: ""It's irony"" Obviously he has no clue what irony is. Actually, him saying that it is irony is ironic because it's not irony. 

For those who deperately need to view the picture: you can go check it out at http://t-shirtlounge.dk

Page 10 headline: Cleaning aid for the lazy stay-at-home-dad
The article is about a small robot that can help with the domestic duties. It's nothing more fancy than a vacuum cleaner that does the work without needing to be handled manually. Just tart it and it'll do its job.
The article as such does not have any feminist issues at first glance but think on this:
1. Who usually does the cleaning? Who usually needs a hand with the housework? It's usually the women, even though they work fulltime like their husbands. But a headline saying: ""Cleaning aid for the busy woman"" just wouldn't appeal to the right audience because....
2. It's a technological gadget and we all know women don't dig that, so even though women are those most in need of this aide, we'll address the men about it.

All I can say is: What the fuck?

Page 12 headline: Bill Clinton to save his wife's campaign

Isn't it rather impressve that the key person here, namely the one running for the presidency has been reduced to less than a name? Hillary Clinton is Bill's wife, she's not a senator, she's not a politician, she's not a potential presidential candidate. Nope, she's Bill's wife. It's a little thing, but it's oh so telling.


All these items in one single newspaper. And people wonder why we still need feminism? I'd say it's obvious. But I guess you need to actually care before you start bothering with truly reading and understanding the news. Thus in the end the answer to the question in the headline becomes: Because I care.

"event","Genesis 28. The story of Esau and Jacob. One thing is how Isaac favours one son over the other and would one with everything and the other with nothing. Ye ancient customs aside Jacob gets Isaac's blessing and his promises of the entire inheritance on a pretense of being Esau, that is apparently acceptable. In the Bible a contract/promise is not void even if it was made based upon a lie. That means that it doesn't matter how well they can prove I'm not the grand daughter of the long lost Anastasia of the Russian tzar family, if one of the Romanovs promised me their fortune thinking I was family, then the fortune is mine.

Do you even realise how con artists would love living in this world? It's ridiculous.

What's worse in the Biblical story is that Esau actually has to plead with his father to convince him that he can at least give him his blessing. Isaac was at first unwilling to bless his own son. Wow, what a caring father he was. It's not like it takes a lot out of him to do that, but Esau has to plead for it, even as Isaac has been deceived and has given a blessing to someone he never intended, he must be convinced how he should bless the one he originally intended.

Yeah, the Bible is truly the paragon of family values."

"event","No, I'm not going into the issue of whether the Bible is true or not. I wouldn't dream of it. But I've decided to sit down and read the Bible from one end to the other. And I just read the story of Abram and Sarai in Egypt. How Abram tells Sarai to join in on the deception that she is his sister rather than his wife, as he suspects the Egyptians would otherwise kill him to win the beautiful Sarai. So eventually Pharaoh attempts to buy Abram's 'sister' with cattle and servants etc. and all the payments are accepted and God sends his wrath upon Pharaoh for making a move on another man's wife. Pharaoh sends Sarai back and the couple leaves Egypt with a bunch of riches, because Pharaoh lets them keep the bride-price he paid for the woman he thought he could have. Genesis 12.

What the hell is this? This is a con. History's first long con I dare say. Make the victim think he can buy what he wants, and then sell him what he thinks he wants. And he will be punished for being gullible and you can walk away rich. No, really, it's a perfectly proper thing to do, it's in the Bible. Sell your wife as a bride pretending she's your sister. Perfectly proper, Abram himself did it.

Now, looking past the appalling concept of buying oneself a bride as today that is not what I take exception to, this is the moral compass for so many people. A moral compass that finds it perfectly alrigt to cheat people out of their riches like a common thief - but I suppose it's alright when the victim is Egyptian and the thief is Abram himself, then it's okay.

Come on! What sort of bigoted self-serving crap is this?

Really...

"event","I have a habit of watching tv with half an eye while browsing the web. I have no&nbsp; idea what's going on on the screen most of the time, but once in a while a line or a few sentences, maybe even a complete exchange will filter through to register in my brain. This was one of them:

""So, why Las Vegas?""
""It's on my to-do list.""
""Oh. So what else is on your to-do list?""
""Four more things left.""
""What are they?""
""Sunset in the desert (...) skydiving.""
""That's only three.""
""I saved the best for last: Make love to first girl I ever kissed.""
""Aw, that's so sweet.""
""You were the first girl I ever kissed.""
""... it may take you some time with that last one there.""
""I hope not. I only have a month.""
""...?""
""I'm dying of cancer.""

And that just made me wanna scream. Did this guy just come asking for a pity-fuck? I think he did. How bloody sad is that? And what's more. She'd feel totally guilty for not returning his affections now that he's in such dire straits. Gee, thanks, dude. This is the kind of crap I'd throw right back into people's faces. Okay, so you're being a sentimental romantic, but it doesn't work any better on people because your health is failing. At least it shouldn't. What is it with the notion that if you're dying you can do and say what you want, you don't have to behave yourself, 'cause you're dying. I've seen it before in people who were very ill (though not necessarily fatally so) or disabled. Because they have that health-wise drawback they think they don't have to treat others decently. They need to think again.

Story from this thing called life:

M and T were dating, had been dating for a few years. In fact they'd gotten engaged. T has a band and together they play gigs here and there. One night after a gig there was to be an afterparty, and ahead of schedule T lets M know that this party might postpone the homecoming to the following day, and was that okay? M's response is this: ""Well, I'd rather you'd stay home with me, but I think you should go party with your friends."" T assured M that: ""If you'd rather have me here I'll come straight home."" but M repeated: ""Of course I'd rather have you home, I love you, but I still think you should go party with your friends.""

Now, at the time M just saw this as being honest with the SO. But later on the emotional blackmail-ish qualities of the exchange became clear. This was not honesty, this was telling T things T did not need to know. 

My point is this. We all do this from time to time. If I want people to stay with me, if I want people to go away, if I want people to do something for my sake, I'm gonna tell them that, but if I want people to make ther own decision and I know&nbsp; their preference lies opposite to mine, I shouldn't be telling them my preference. If I want my friend/sibling/you-name-it to do something for themselves for their own sake, I should definitely NOT be telling them what I'd prefer them to do. 'cause that's guilt-tripping them and it only ensures that what they go to enjoy will become an irritant for them because of said guilt, and that would hardly be fair of me.

And that exchange from the tv series was just the worst. One thing is staying home or not, one thing is coming to a party or not, but that exchange was about guilt-tripping a woman into having sex with this guy who's supposedly dying of cancer. If he wanted to make love to her so badly, he can bloody well go and make an honest effort to prove to her that it's a good idea, just like everyone else. Why should she grant him a pity-fuck?&nbsp; Sure he'll get to make love to this woman before he dies. But then what? He'll die, what's the use then?

I'll tell you what the use is. There'll be a woman left alive who might regret sleeping with him, because she really didn't love him, and oh my goodness what if he thought it meant more than it did? It won't matter to him because he's dead, but it'll matter to her, because it's her integrity, and it's her who has to live with it for the rest of her days and those are likely to be a good deal more plentiful than his. It's been proven before that even if a woman does consent to sex, the fact that she does so reluctantly and for the wrong reasons can have the same psychological effects on her as a rape. And that's pretty bloody serious. 

Let that be a lesson to us women: We shouldn't allow ourselves to be guilt-tripped into something we're not sure we really want.

But let it also be a lesson to everyone, no matter the gender: Guilt-tripping others into singing your tune is a bad thing to do. Stop it. Not polite. Not the good nor right thing to do. Make it stop. Right. Now.

Emotional blackmail takes the blame for so much crap, everyone ought to put in an effort to kill it. But unfortunately, as long as some individuals might benefit from doing it, they won't stop. Neither respect nor decency is common currency these days. Tsk. Tsk."

"event","I have just received an email offering me the job of stage manager on the summer show again in 2008. The director is a woman who acted in the show back in 99 and 2000 and she remembers me and wants to know if I'll be there again. I'm honoured, I'm flattered, but during rehearsal periods it's a bloody full time job - and I already have a full time job. This summer I made a point of not starting my full time occupation till rehearsals were over, and even then my life consisted of nothing more than working sleeping and eating. Getting up at 4.30 AM to go to work. Coming home at 3 PM and then getting a bit of sleep and leaving again at 6.30-ish PM to run the show and getting home at 11 PM to go to bed and sleep a few hours. It was hell, and I was half dead most of the time. And that was only the steady-going shows, that was not in the rehearsal period. That one's always worse.

I like the job, I love working with the actors and other nice people on the set. Every year the organisation behind the show s a pain in the arse, and they are truly incompetent and sometimes infantile idiots who can make a pig's ear of anything and everything. But I do really love the job itself, it's challenging, it's diverse, and it takes xactly those skills I value so greatly in myself. The ability to think on my feet and react quickly to unexpected situations, without losing track of the plans in motion and sticking to them while fixing any problems that might have arisen - and they always do.

So.... ARGH! It's too early for me to make this decision. Especially at this time when I hate my regular full time job because it bores me to death, I'm not sure my head is clear and ready to make the decision, but I do need to make one, because they do need to find someone else if I don't take the job.

On one hand, it's a fun job and I do like it, and I think I may also be hoping somewhat for the possibility of one day making a living of being a stage manager, that'd be totally awesome, but on the other, working for these people is something I've ranted and vented about every year. Every single year, and they never learn from their mistakes, though they are hardly the only ones to be *that* dense.

Either way, I'm in two minds about it.... probably more than two actually.

Meh.... thoughts, thoughts, thoughts. Worries. Doubts. Hopes and fears.

Yes or No? I really truly haven't got an inkling what my answer should or will be."

This girl, Nnenna, was on the phone, and judging from the cuts with comments from Jade, I think it was, Nnenna ha been having trouble with her boyfriend back at home for some time. So Nnenna is talking to said bf on the phone and these lines are spoken:

The boyfriend: ""Why. Can't. You. Love Me.""

Nnenna: ""Well.... your love seems to be causing me pain right now.""

And though Nnenna was generally undecided and completely unable to put her foot down, her comeback to this was just perfect. While I'm no fan of these so-called reality shows, I can very well imagine that the girls are going through immense amounts of pressure, and that boyfriend was just demanding Nnenna's presence while she's competing for her life's dream.

So this was just fantastic. Why can't she just love him? Well, because right now he's not being very lovable. Sometimes things relly *are* simple. And a lot of people - women as well as men - ought to realise that too often the answer to this boyfriend's question is what Nnenna told him. Sometimes there's really no need to ask the question."

There won't be fireworks to enjoy at my folks' countryside home what with the place only being a small village, whereas I have first row view for everything our city will send up. Living in the tallest building in town has its benefits.

So now I'm brainstorming for ideas for the New Years dinner. Now that I have a proper kitchen and all I can actually ook what I want, so I'll whip up something fancy and delicious - Because I can :P

Before that happens t'll be Christmas, though. Last year we had no day of chocolate or whatever we should call it. The day when the four of us get together to create the chocolates we use as deserts and presents over Christmas and New Years. Because my folks have moved to that countryside house that needed major renovation they had no room for this. After all, you can't have chocolate coating drying in a place where the concrete dust in the air makes it feel like you have sand between your teeth every time you haphazardly took a breath with your mouth open.

And my brother and I both lived in tiny little flats with no room for more than two people at a time - and no table whatsoever.

My folks still live in their construction yard :P but this year I have much more room in my much bigger flat. So I suggested we have our Day of Chocolates at my place. I have a huge dinner table on which we can work and have the finished works drying. So I'll be in charge of dinner that day as well, and it'll likely be on Saturday the 22nd. 

It's all good, I've already decided on some things to have.

"event","This morning the papers showed a grizzly headline. Some of us had heard it in the late news. The story was that a recently married couple had been at home, when they'd seen from their window two men breaking into their car parked on the street. The man had gone out to dissuade the would-be burglars, but instead the men had rushed into the couple's home. The man had fought, but had been knocked unconscious in the bathroom, and his wife had been struck down and had died (though I immediately wondered at tha wording, since.... how would he know if he was unconscious?) and when he woke up he'd found his wife dead in the bed, and immediately he alerted emergency services and the police.

Several people have made statements concerning this already. Especially comments along the lines of ""earlier burglars would run away if they were seen, now people have become so hardened that they'll attack instead"".&nbsp; I and many of my colleagues read the newspaper on the way to work, and we were all shaking our heads at how terrible it was.

And just now I hear on the news that the forensic technicians have worked their magic once more. Apparently there may not have been any burglars at all, though the police will not rule them out entirely. What forensics have also found is that a prime suspect for the woman's murder is her husband. Mainly because the woman had not been struck down, but had been strangled. The man's injuries are so far unexplained to the public, the papers' websites are currently speculating whether he had injured himself, though I expect that we may at some point hear that they've found some of his DNA under her finger nails, perhaps on her knuckles.

Either way, like a classic case on CSI and all the other crime shows, this case appears to be yet another femicide where the murderer is a close relation, who even calls the police with a fake report of attackers.

I hope that whatever evidence forensics found at the scene are enough to prosecute the man. No, he hasn't been found guilty just yet, but he has been arrested, and since most violent attacks on women happen between close relations I'm inclined to believe him guilty. But we shall see.

As it is, I'll be following the development in this one."

Only barely, though. It would not have taken many votes shifted leftwards and things would have looked very different. I am rather pleased nonetheless, because the fact that my left-wing party has received so many more votes than last time shows that the Danes have begun to move left again, and not to the bigger center-left party (The social democrats), no, to a true left-party. And that warms my little socialist heart.

It's not much, but it's enough to soothe my disappointment that we didn't get a left-wing government this time either.

Besides, since there was such a close run between the wings it's rather likely that we'll have another election in the not so far future. I strongly doubt they'll wait 4 years. They're probably gonna wait till their own wing is better ahead of the other in the opinion surveys, and then hve a new election so they can get a somewhat more comfortable majority then what they have now.

But the scenarios I'd planned and written for this weekend turned out to animate my players to such levels of team spirit as I have never seen them muster ever before. It was amazing. They were cheering each other on during dice rolls, and they have such different characters that all of them can contribute with elements sorely needed. No one is superfluous, no one can be done without.&nbsp;

I am so very pleased with how things turned out, and I have been jotting down new ideas all weekend.

My good friend M, who's a player in this campaign and has loads more GM experience than I do, gave me some feedback today and told me that he'd still been all giddy with the Shadowrun-vibes all Sunday. That didn't exactly make my head any smaller hehe. He thought it had been a really good couple of sessions and was very enthusiastic about what's going to come next.

Also, he told me he'd managed to spark the enthusiasm of his brother-in-law, N, whom I'm sort of expecting and hoping will join is come spring and with luck late winter. All of us five regulars in the group are academics, and M's bro-in-law is an officer of the Danish Armed Forces. He'll be home from Kosovo in February/March, and I think it'd be great to have someone in the group who actually knows his shit when it comes to urban warfare and such. 

M tells me that N is slightly insecure about role-playing, and he very much favours fantasy. I hope the heavy fantasy elements of magic and races will get him to try it out (well... that and some persuasion by M), and I'm sure that I can show him that the types of story-lines he so appreciated in the fantasy RPs he's tried (D&amp;D and AD&amp;D) can also be had in this setting. 

Anyhow, we've got the potential for some really really enjoyable sessions with this set-up, and I'm very much looking forward to introducing my players to Shadows of Europe and the different plotlines I've thought out, both the entertaining as well as the nasty ones."

"event","I'm gonna go backwards in chronology with this post. Starting with yesterday. Or last evening to be specific. My friend M called and informed me that our RP scenario has been accepted by Fastaval - the Con we're writing it for. We attempted last year as well, and were in the group of 'finalists' that had written sufficiently good scenarios, but alas. Too many were better than us in the last sorting and we didn't make the final cut. 
But this year we did. Major YAY! We're in! This is perhaps the most influential and prestigious RP Con in Denmark, the Con where diceless and systemless RP is considered an art, the Con where new genres are invented every year. So, being role-players and quite heavy on the enthusiasm we're excited and all worked up about it. Very much looking forward to presenting the complete and well worked-through scenario. 

Yeah we're weird, but we enjoy it. Just like we enjoyed dressing up for the Pirate Costume Party on Saturday. And rum doesn't make a person less weird, I might add.

Progressing over the past two weeks at work something rather... peculiar has revealed itself to me. The man I'm often teamed with for picking started flirting with me. Nothing wrong there, that's not peculiar in and of itself. No, the thing he decided to reveal about himself, now that's peculiar. Or perhaps more bluntly stated: crazy.

Taking breaks once in a while we chat about this and that of course. And I mentioned that I'm quite into fantasy. He's not, and for some reason this topic led him to divulge that he's a psychic.

""Uhhh okay...""

Now, I will not go so far as to say that I'm sure what's true and what's not. I don't believe in god, in a creator, in an ultimate being, but I do believe there are many things in and of this world that we humans don't always see and much less understand. I have experienced certain things myself that have convinced me that there is indeed more between heaven and earth... as they say. But I draw no conclusions, and I listen to all statements and stories concerning such things with a healthy dose of scepticism, there are so many frauds when it comes to exactly these things.

So the man tells me he's a psychic. My first thought is whether he's just trying to impress me by making up a story that might appeal to a fantasy reader, or whether he's trying to impress me with something he truly believes about himself - or whether he's just being frank, but I find this latter option to be rather unlikely. I've no idea why he was telling me this, liking fantasy books normally does not lead me to discuss the supernatural in our own world.

My second thought was whether to be openly sceptic or whether to play along and show interest and see how far he'll take the story. I opted for the latter, it might turn out to be amusing after all. And oh boy, was I right.

This man is completely and utterly off his rocker. Yes, I'm willing to believe that some people are psychic, but when you hear this, you'll see why I'm more inclined to laugh at this one.

Oh yes, he started talking, and once I had shown interest and hadn't laughed him off the floodgates opened. Oh yeah, he can talk to those on the other side, he's been out to cleanse houses and the like. Ayup. And I was doing the whole ""Ohh, I see. Aha. Yeah? Hmmm."" And when he's out cleansing houses he's usually successful, as he says, because on his side he has The Messiah and for extra back-up 8 world leaders - though he mentioned no names. 

I raised my eyebrows at this and commented that that sounded like a pretty bloody efficient team. He agreed and confirmed that if his allies here couldn't handle it, it was Evil itself (obviously meaning Satan). I made sure to nod in understanding. What he said made perfect sense, but his all too quick divulgement of his alliance with Messiah had me suspicious. The suspicion did not fade at all when he told me that he and Messiah were really close. He had, in fact, been Judas in an earlier life and the Bible had been edited so heavily that the part of Judas was so twisted that it was almost unrecognizable. Yeah, I'd heard that before. Oh yeah, he'd been Judas alright, sometimes he had problems with his neck and hands and feet.

And there I went thinking ""Uhm, yeah, Judas hung himself, so I see the neck-problem right there, but hands and feet? It was Jesus who was crucified, you dolt, not Judas/you.""

Ahem. He continued with the reincarnation stuff. I threw in the comment that I had a friend who was positive that he'd been Jack the Ripper in a previous life to which I commented ""Yeah, he and 800 others."" And my colleague here smiled and agreed with my disbelief and explained that types like that - Jack the Ripper, that is, not my friend - don't come back. They receive their punishment never to return. 

And to get back on more interesting topics, such as himself and his merits that might impress me, he said he'd also been a boy king. I dryly remarked that there'd been quite a few. Which one of them was he referring to? In Egypt, King Tut. THE King Tut.&nbsp; I managed to prevent my eyebrows from disappearing beyond my hairline, this was getting real good, oh yes. Yeah, as he said, he never should've gotten off that horse. That's what got him killed. And here I was laughing inside. King Tut was from Egypt, you dolt, he didn't ride the horse, he would've been in a chariot.

He mentioned a few other people he'd been that I no longer remember, I just rememer thinking. Oh wow... does he really think I'll believe all this shit? But I think he does. Because if he didn't, he wouldn't have made the comment he did a few days later.

We have radios in our trucks so we can have some entertainment while driving around the faciility. I usually listen to P2 since it plays classical music and jazz and other such good stuff. What with the noise in the storage facility the speaker's voice is difficult to make out while driving, so I didn't hear who wrote this particular piece of music, just that it was a double-concerto for flute and harp. Oh lovely, I think, I love harp. And while listening I recognized some harmonizations that reminded me an awful lot of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, so I was guessing the composer is Mozart. My colleague here was fairly impressed with how at home I was in this sort of music, and I told him I grew up with this sort of thing.

A few minutes later he came up to me (the only reason I can think of for him not to say it immediately is that he had to come up with it first) and said: ""Perhaps I should drop the bomb now."" Man, I was worried, was he gonna ask me out on a date? Was he gonna tell me he has the hots for me? I looked at him questioningly. ""I was also Mozart."" He stated. I laughed and said jokingly ""Then perhaps you can tell me whether you wrote this concerto."" We had a bit of a laugh at that. After the concerto had finished playing the speaker confirmed my suspicions; it was indeed Mozart.

I don't know whether this man thinks that if I'm into fantasy then psychic stuff must be the way to lure me in, or whether he's so unsure of himself that he has to rely on having been someone else in order to be able to impress me. Either way makes him a pathetic loser.

Further intel reports that a friend's sister met him at a party and he talked about this new young woman at his workplace whom he has the hots for, and since I'm the only young woman there. Well, doesn't take a genius to figure out what he be wanting. Said sister also reported the impression that ""He's creepy!"" Those were the words, and what with what he's told me now, about what an important person he has been several times in previous lives, most likely to compensate what an insignificant fellow he is in his current inarnation, I'm inclined to agree.

The sad thing is. He's a really friendly person. Not one of those macho types who have to emphasize their own presence all the time, he's slightly anonymous, it's easy to not even notice that he's there. And he's overall really companionable and I like working with him, and then he has to turn out to be crazy. Psychic, okay, that I can deal with. But come on. Judas, and King Tut, AND Mozart and others.... oh please. I'm not stupid. I mean... this makes him a total fucking nutjob.

And now. Going back in time to last weekend. Saturday to be exact. Pirate Party for the staff members at the school where I teach RP classes. I managed to throw together a pretty awesome costume if I do say so myself. The party started unusually early, but hey, they might have something planned. We arrived, all of us more or less pirated up, and while the cooks set up the indoors gas grill for roasting a whole pork we filed into an adjacent room for what was apparently a lecture. I thought: ""Oh, neat. A lecture about pirates, a nifty idea to start off the party with."" But oh how wrong I was. We all sat there ready to party like it was 1748 dressed up as scallywags, ready to drink rum and shout obscenities at the imaginary offenders who might want to prevent us from being pirates. 

And the lecturer? A man in his late 50s I'd say, perhaps in his 60s. The headmistress had heard his lectures before and had enjoyed them very much, it was her idea to bring him here. I think his main theme was communication, how we communicate and how we avoid it while still pretending to. It might have been relevant if it had been serious, it might have been funny if it had been... well... funny. The problem was, this man tried to be both. And while alternating between wannabe-witty and wannabe-wise he was all the time being incredibly sexist. 

I was furious. For some reason his points always circled back to women. And his scentific evidence? None. I quote: ""Now, I don't know women in general but I know my wife/mother/mother-in-law, and she..."". I can use anecdotal evidence for exactly shit. The best one was when he recalled from his childhood how on Sundays after Sunday dinner his father and the children would sit around in the living room, while his mother would be doing the dishes - always being noisy ith those dishes, so noisy in fact that sometimes the father said to the children ""I wonder what's wrong out there..."" but not a word about actually checking. Then this particular Sunday the nise stops and his mother enters the room and finally voices her problem. It is unfair that she has to stand out there all alone and do the dishes. His father readily agrees. ""Why of course it is, no one's asking you to, we'd rather have you with us in here!"" And then there's that whole self-satisfaction as if these were the wisest and wittiest words ever. Yeah, so the woman will have enjoyed this Sunday with them and postponed doing the dishes. Bt guess who will hav to do said dishes when it's much later and the food has fossilized and is twice as hard to get off? Her! Alone! He didn't say it, but it was so obvious. 

And all the bullshit about how women are fussing about decorations, because his wife is, and how mothers want to ruin everyone's nice homes with their children's horrible creations ecause his daughter is like that (now who's the one fussing about decorations?), how women are this and how women are that. He works as a counsellor for companies who need help with sorting communication problems between their employees, and all the examples he drew from this work were about girls. Note I very clearly quote girls. He described that he came to this firm where 20 girls worked and they needed his help with communication problems. Might I just point out that girls are female humans under the age of 18? I think he meant women, but he consistently said girls in these examples.

And these 20 ""girls"" needed his help wth communicating, and he said he felt all lost because he didn't know much about that, he's a psychologist. So when he showed up and asked what the problem was they explained they were very upset. And he said that that made him very happy because then he could help them. His solution: he sent them all home to cheer up - I figure he tried to joke about it here. I sincerely hope no company him money for it if he did what he said he did.

Oh yeah, and he disliked children and young people too. Because young people don't know anything. Well, they may know something but they have no experiene. And he kept going along those lines. By the time we got to the break I was so furious I very nearly left the establishment.&nbsp; Here is this man who seems to have a sort of homoerotic relationship with his telescopic pointer - yup it started pen-size and extended to 2 ft or somesuch - and the way he was fiddling with it all the time through the lecture it gave me clear images of something decidedly erotic. Judging from his gestures, and his references to his home-life, I'd say he's still in the closet. Goodness knows that it would explain a lot of the domestic issues he kept referring to. And this outrageously offensive most likely closet homosexual spent alost two hours consistently degrading, insulting and blaming women (and to some degree young people) for everything.

I think it was supposed to be funny. But there was no point. No punchline. A few of the teachers seemed to enjoy themselves, but at least half were just annoyed. That lecture was such a party-pooper. I didn't go back inside after the break, I was simply too angry, thankfully one of the other teachers felt the same so we had ourselves a good and proper rant about the git in the next room. He (the teacher) had some pretty good observations about the git as well, so we managed to vent and get over it.

And we were totally in party-mood again by the time the actual festivites started. Eating pork with our fingers and pretending to shoot each other with our toy flint-lock pistols. Singing pirate songs. And as is tradition: The new teachers must be initiated. Every year we have an initiation that goes with the theme of the party. Last time was a medeval party and the new teachers were 'knighted' to be Knights of our School, this year they were given a pirate name and had to walk the plank. Much hilarity ensued. Especially as the initiated filed into the room, blindfolded and with a hand on the shoulder of the person in front of them. My RP teacher colleague and I immediately saw the resemblence and intoned Hoist the Colours from PotC At World's End. That was so awesome. And after an entire night of yelling ARRRRR way too much it took me three days to regain some semblance of my normal voice. That bit was rather awful, but what can I say? When I party, I party hard, and when I go to a costume party I tend to role-play my costume. I'm weird like that.

But damn it was fun. And thus the post ended on a more cheerful note."

"event","When I drove home last night around it was beginning to get really foggy. Huge, lightly swirling banks of white-ish mist had gathered in undistubed places. By now, in the morning, it is so dense that I can't see the ground. I'm on the tenth floor and I can barely make out the outbuilding at the foot of the highrise, but the actual ground? Nope, if I didn't know better I'd say there were none. It's a weird view.

I mean, I'm used to fog, it's a fairly normal occurence here in DK, but living in a highrise is still fairly new to me, and so not seeing the ground below is new to me. It's an odd feeling.

We've had a lot of fog these days. Wednesday when I drove my brother to the airport at around 18.30 we saw the beginning heavy fog gather in valleys and along creeks. It is so beautiful. We have an expression for such a very localised fog here, an expression that originated with the mythology of all the creatures living underground. Elves, gnomes, will-'o'-the-wisps, jack-'o'-lanterns. This is the swamplady. And when such dense loclised fog is gathering we say that the swamplady is brewing, what we see is the steam from her kitchens. What exactly she's brewing is never mentioned.

Mind, we don't have huge gator infested swamps here, ours are different. We have a lot of hills here in DK, and where there are hills there valleys, and where there's a low point water will gather, so we have a lot of spots of marsh/swamp/bog-like land in the midst of fields and forests. It is in these places that the swamplady/marshlady brews once in a while. And Wednesday she was busy in the kitchens. I dropped my bro off at the airport, waved goodbye and returned homewards - by then it was dense fog all over. I could hardly even see the road I was on, so the return trip was somewhat slow going. By the time I left the hills and got into flatter country the fog was nothing more than light mist, though. 

And this morning the world seems to have been taken in for the night. It's just... gone.

It looks awesome - in all its 'not being seen'. I like what fog does to my mentality, it somehow shows the world as right here, but not here anyway. I know the world is there, but I could just as well be alone in a desert. It's a strange feeling of lonesomeness (NOT loneliness) in the midst of everything.

I like fog. It makes me introspective hehe, it makes me poetic as well, as if the lack of visual contact with the world, makes it easier to find peace. I dunno what exactly it is, but it works for me, and I like it."

"event","Okay, so maybe it was stupid to drink an entire pot of tea (nearly two litres) during the afternoon. Whatever the cause, the result was that I didn't fall asleep until well past 3 AM this night. Instead I was lying there thinking through a one-shot PotC fanfic for the second time. One with a tragic, tragic ending. So tragic in fact that I've made meself cry both times I thought it through. Silly, really. After I'd planned it out and still couldn't fall asleep I got up and wandered aimlessly about the bedroom singing songs from LotR... mostly in Elven.

I spent a lot of time going through things I want to do. Primarily, if I'm making tea today I won't be drinking it quite as late in the afternoon as I did yesterday.

"event","I knew my old flat was quiet. Very quiet even. It was tiny, and it was a cramped little space within a big block of concrete. And my single window was to the North. It was also quite well-insulated both in terms of temperature and sound. So all in all I had no idea what the world was like outside. I could see if it was raining or whether the sun was shining, but that was about it. Cold? Warm? Windy? I had no idea. Many a time did I leave home dressed in much too cold or much too warm clothes, mostly the former, though.

When I still lived at home I had a bed right beneath the roof in a small open attic with a sky-light 7 cms above my bed. I could see and hear the weather all the time. It was lovely.

But apparently the years I spent in that tiny little space has gotten me accustomed to the silence.

Autumn is marching in. And I'm now living on the 10th floor in a high-rise. It is not one among many, it is in fact the tallest building in this city. This one has 14 floors above the ground floor, the surrounding 6 blocks have 11 floors above the ground floor. And we're placed along the coast-line of the fiord. We are possibly the most wind-swept area in town, and added to that is the non-aero-dynamic shape of the blocks, meaning it is always windy here. 

But as I said, autumn as announced its arrival with stronger winds than usual, and this night I realized that I have gotten used to a quiet flat. The noises of the wind as it turns the corners of the block - I live in the end flat, I have three outer walls - were louder even than what I was used to back in the attic in my parents' villa. There was howling and booming sounds worse than anything I remember, and having been used to utter silence for a few years this was actually quite the disturbance. I didn't sleep many hours during the night. The windows creaked and it was all in all the kind of noises I would expect to hear in a ghost story taking place in a storm-swept gothic mansion on some faraway coast.

The sounds were awesome, I really like such sounds. I must conclude, though, that I need to get used to them again. Because I lost a frightening amount of sleep while listening to these new sounds."

"event","I am just reading on CNN.com that Kathy Griffin had her Emmy acceptance speech censored. Now, I don't know the lady, I've never seen the show she won the award for, heck, I seldom even watch award shows.<br /><br />However, there's one thing that has always struck me the few times I did sit down to watch the Academy Awards, the Emmy, the Cannes festival you name it. In people's acceptance speeches they often thank either God or Jesus. I don't particularly mind, really, if people want to believe that God or Jesus played an active part in them doing ther job well enough to win an award, that's fine by me. It always does make me wonder, though, if in case God was the deciding factor here shouldn't the actor/director/screenwriter be denied the award since apparently they did not do their own work and thus should not receive the award... or even worse, if it's to God's credit that they won... perhaps the jury should be sacked for letting themselves be influenced by things not relevant to the film/series.... or perhaps all religious people should be excluded from award contests beause they have unfair means of influencing the jury from above.<br /><br />That's all in all just sarcasm. As I said, I'm fine with people believing whatever they want to believe about where credit is due.<br /><br />That brings me back to Kathy Griffin. She has bviously noticed the same thing I have. Here's a snippet from the CNN.com article:<br /><br />In her speech, Griffin said that ""a lot of people come up here and thank Jesus for this award. I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus.""<p> She went on to hold up her Emmy, make an off-color remark about Christ and proclaim, ""This award is my god now!""</p> <!--startclickprintexclude-->     	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 		 			 				 				 				 				 					 					 				 				 			 		 		 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 	 	 	 	 		 			 		 	 	 	 		 			 				 				 			 		 	 	 	 			 			 				 					 					   				 			 			 			 			 		 	 	  <!--endclickprintexclude--><p> The comedian's remarks were condemned Monday by Catholic League President Bill Donohue, who called them a ""vulgar, in-your-face brand of hate speech.""</p>*************************<br /><br />And these remarks will apparently be censored away when the show will be broadcast on tv. All because some Catholics were offended by her not being Catholic.<br /><br />Honestly! This is ridiculous. For once there is someone who's not afraid to go up there and take the credit for her own hard work. Like she said: Jesus did not do the work that got her the award. SHE did. SHE earned the award. SHE was good enough to get it. But darned if she's allowed to say it. If others want to believe that Kathy only got the award because God willed it, so be it. But she herself has every right to not believe that.<br /><br />And the woman is a comedian, so instead of going up there and thanking her drama teacher and her screen writer, or whatever, it's an obvious joke to NOT thank people and entities that everyone else seem to thank. But heavens if the Catholic League can even consider the notion that she has every right to hold her own opinion of such things. Really, she didn't call anyone idiots for thanking Jesus, she just proclaimed that Jesus didn't help her win that award. And whether or not the award is now her God... that may be blasphemous to Catholics, but I guess it's not to Ms. Griffin. And last I heard people were allowed to believe what they want, even if it's that a green luminiscent cat that lives in a cardboard box in my backyard is the all-encompassing entity known as God. It's their right! And there's this ting called Freedom of Speech too! So we're all allowed to say what we believe as long as we do not aim malicious intent at anyone or incite hate and violence.<br /><br />Really! <br /><br />Did Ms. Griffin show any malicious intent? No. She apparently just thought it funny that so many thank God, and she wanted to make a point of not doing so.<br />Did she incite to hate? Nope. She was merely pointing out what she herself does not believe. She was speaking for no one but herself.<br />Did she incite to violence? Hardly. It does sound like she caused a violent apoplexy with some Catholics, though, but she can't be held responsible for that.<br /><br />Then what the hell are they censoring her for?<br /><br />I can tell you that. They're censoring her for exactly the same reasons Iran and China censors the media too. Think on that!<br /><br />Bah!"

"event","Yeah. Yesterday I acquired my truck certificate. The theory test was a piece of cake. 12 pictures, to each picture a question and 4 statements in response. We had to mark whether the statements were correct answers to the question or not. Very simple sort of test where we did actually have to remember the correct info ourselves but just had to recognize the correct info. 4 of the 12 pictures were about reading weight allowance diagrams. We were allowed to mess up the questions for two of the pictures, as long as none of them were a diagram, those had to be correct all of them.

And as I said: Piece of cake. I passed without a single error. As I had set out to :P

The driving test had me quite a bit more nervous. We had to drive three trucks each. A stacker, which works excatly the same as those I've used for the past three months, except this one has a mast and can lift higher than 15 centimeters, a battery truck and a gas truck. Both those trucks were what they call a counterweight truck (it's what most people consider a normal forlift). However, we could switch the battery counterweight truck for a battery reach truck, which I did, 'cause I like that one.

The test itself was fairly simple. We did exactly the same as we'd been doing in practice all week. Moving pallets, boxes, basins and pipes back and forth. The stacker and the reach truck I was comfortable with, but the gas truck.... yuck. The problem with the gas truck is just that... the gas. Sometimes you needed extra throttle to raise the forks with a load on them, and sometimes you had to use the brake pedal simultaneously with the throttle, which bothers me greatly because that's the very last thing you do in a car. 

Anyhow, I managed to befriend the gas truck. And at the exam the examinator absolutely had to hover around me and one of the other girls while we were out driving our most hated trucks. Great, just fabulous. But it was alright, 'cause I'd placed a basin on a trailer and the examinator tok a look at it - I'd placed it exactly along the edge - and said that if I were to put a side rail on that the basin would be in the way, could I please move it 3 centimeters further in. So I did move it three centimeters further in. Exactly three centimeters. He took another look at it and looked up at me slightly nonplussed, I think, and then said: ""You took me seriously about those three centimeters, didn't you?"" I could only reply: ""Yep, I did"" and flash him a cheeky grin.

All in all it was quite relaxed.

3 failed the theory test, one of them failed the driving test as well. But the rest of us got through nicely.

So today I was back at work. Driving a reach truck more than twice the weight of the one we'd used at the school. That was awesome. First thing I did in the morning was go and pick up a full pallet of windows in 7.5 meters' height. I loves me some of that hehehe. 

I pick somewhat slower than I did before... I need to get used to the new routines not to mention the truck. But I'll be up to par soon enough. Having a work day, in which I don't have to stand up on a roughly vibrating surface but can sit down instead, is so much less exhausting. I haven't been as fresh after a work day in a long time as I was today.

So that part of my life has just become a lot easier."

"event","When I got home from the show last night, I found that my bro had placed two pints of Newcastle Brown Ale on my table. Bless his soul. I invited him in, so we had one each, and had a lovely night talking about this and that. The show had gone incredibly well, standing ovations and all. 

Tonight it's the opening night. Big shtuff.

I posted the prologue to my PotC fic yesterday. The first chapter of the story is taking shape nicely at a rate of two pages/day it seems. I'm hoping to post it tonight. I'll have to cross my fingers, because I can't sit up late and write tonight like I could last night.

I'll be moving all my belongings to my new place tomorrow - and we'll get an early start because my landline is being moved. Sadly, my internet won't be moved till later in June. Seems like I'll have to begin haunting the places in town where I can access free cordless networks with my laptop. 

*whine*

No internet for a month! I'll die. Surely. But I have stuff to write, so I'm sure I can occupy my time :P"

"event","I have the weirdest dreams these days.

This morning I dreamt that someone - I don't recall who it was, but it was definitely someone who holds some authority over me - suggested she cut my hair so its ends would be aligned. Normally I just cut it myself when it's in a pony tail. So she combed my hair back and then cut it so the ends were aligned - only she took about 30 cms off, which was completely unnecessary since I've just trimmed my ends myself. It left me with hair that didn't even qualify as long, and it was just a really odd dream. No idea why I dreamt that."

"event","I sometimes look after my folks' dog. He's an Irish terrier named Kian and I love him very much. Next Saturday - June 2nd - I'll be dogsitting. And this night I had a nightmare about it. It was insane. 

I was dogsitting, and in one version of the nightmare I was at my folks' place though their neighbours were not the ones they actually have. In the other version of the nightmare I was dogsitting at my own new place. I've agreed with mum that I will dogsit at my own place, and I will take Kian's morning walk with him, so she won't have to get up hella early in order to get it done before they have to leave. So in my dream I take Kian for that morning walk, and we run into this lady who has a puppy of undefined race. She doesn't keep the dog on a leash - though it is actually decreed by law that you must keep your dog on a leash at all times except in areas specifically fenced in for the exact purpose of letting the dogs run loose.

The puppy and Kian of course show some interest in each other - like normal dogs do. But they quickly get to fighting. Since I have Kian on a leash I can pull him away from the puppy, but the lady cannot call her puppy back. That's when it gets all strange. The puppy is bloody strong and muscle-y for a puppy, it actually gets the upper hand (paw?), maybe also because Kian was on his leash. I won't even begin to explain why a puppy who started out being a cutesy puppy could suddenly outweigh and outfight a bigger and heavier adult dog - it was a nightmare. 

The 'puppy' ends up getting a pretty good grip around Kian's upper jaw. I wake up when it chomps down and I hear Kian's upper jaw being utterly pulverized between it's teeth. That Crrrrack! still ringing in my ears I woke up at 4.30 in the morning, and while I was still in that semi-awake state I kept dreaming that I was screaming for the woman to call a vet ambulance while I was cradling a bloody, whimpering, dying Kian in my lap, and she was only concerned with how her puppy was looking a mess because it had gotten blood in its fur.

I didn't fall asleep till 6 in the morning and I slept badly, too, having that nightmare doing infinite re-runs in my head.

I lay awake for so long trying to tell myself to not think about it all the while I was so upset I was crying. Normally I don't remember my dreams, and this one I'd rather not have remembered. I'm writing this down the 29th, and I still get all upset thinking about it. It was absolutely awful.

Now I'm just wondering whether it was supposed to warn me against dog-sitting on Saturday. I've had premonitions before, this better not be one. If it is, I wanna end my subscription."

"event","Yeah, I'm a cheapskate. I don't buy expensive clothing, I don't buy expensive footwear. I usually wait till I can get what I want on a spring sale, which means I have to anticipate next winter's boot needs when the spring sales happen etc etc. I'm usually quite good at it, but there's that thing about sales, the good stuff has already been sold and now they need to get rid of the remains.

I don't have hug demands to my clothes and footwear other than comfyness. I'm the sort of person who doesn't need to buy clothes with a specific combination of them in mind, I just go home and combine the way I feel like it (I usually make something decent of it, too). Anyway, last autumn - I think - I got me a pair of sneakers for a mere 100 DKK. On sale from Bianco iirc. Their footwear has never been known for high quality, but a 100 DKK for a pair of sneakers - fine by me. They fit me perfectly, looked nice and all that jazz. Finding something like that is usually fairly difficult for me, since I use rather small sizes. 

I bought them, and I've found that their rather thin soles mean that I can feel quite accurately the ground I'm walking on. I like that, because preferably I'd be walking barefoot, which I do much of the time even through downtown. However, sometimes you are in locations where bare feet would be bad. A theatre set for instance. You never know how many nails and whatnot you might find in your foot because you didn't look where you were walking. So I wear shoes there - duh. It's also a tad too cold not to wear shoes these days. Pity.

However, my work as stage manager and responsible for all the props and such, it demands of me that I run around town quite a lot. I've spend about as much time stalking through town today as I normally do on 5 days combined. And I'm rather hard on my footwear, and with thin soles that becomes rather hard on my feet.

OMG my feet are sore. and I've actually worn holes in the soles of those shoes. Ergo I need new ones, but I hate spending money on that. So I figure I'm gonna go hi-jack another on-sale thing or whatever. They usually have May-market offers. Urgh... I never get blisters.... but today I have them. Woo-fucking-hoo."

"event","It's been some very interesting last few days. Starting with Thursday we had our final session of our Alternity campaign. According to plan this was the day we would all tell each other what we've been doing outside the group sessions. We've all had the option of doing a whole lot of character play, simply to get more flavour in the game. We would not earn xp for what we did outside the game sessions, thus some would be less motivated to do it, but those of us who just wanted that intense RP experience... well, we had the option. I made immense use of it. The character that had started out somewhat non-descript and not all that much to my liking has spent this campaign growing into the character I've enjoyed the most. Ever. That's really something.

What's more: though Rei is one of the most fiercely loyal creatures, she still does need a reason to be loyal to others, and within the first 3 or 4 scenarios of the campaign (which started last year around this time) the other three in the group had proven themselves untrustworthy. The poor soul was devastated and desperate, she couldn't even trust her own crew - how sad is that? Thus, outside of the group sessions I have spent much time doing character play. I could not earn xp, but I could earn opportunities. If I took some time talking to people, nursing relations, I could establish contacts for the character that she had not had originally. It gave me a much wider range of opportunities when we sat in the group-sessions. This I used to my advantage. Mind, it meant that sometimes the others couldn't sell that top-secret weapons research we'd salvaged from a ship, so they missed out on thousands and thousands of credits, but since the alternative was that we'd be indirectly responsible for the detonation of an entire planet, my character did the only thing she could do; she went behind their backs and made sure the weapons research didn't end int he wrong hands.

Now, if there's one thing I am good at as a player, it's fooling others. That's what makes me a good role-player. I'm difficult to read unless people know me very well. Rei had started out being a very straight-forward character who kept getting accused by the others of being an agent of the Free Space Alliance - FSA . She wasn't, and the others knew it, but she changed, and she kept this change secret to them - they had, after all, proved themselves to be untrustworthy - so they still thought she was harmless and straight-forward when she did in fact become an agent of the Alliance Secret Service - yes: ASS. This was all quite entertaining. I did from time to time suspect that they had me figured out, or at least that one of them suspected something. But as we laid our cards open on Thursday it turned out none of them had seen it coming. I had the others figured out - mostly. But not the other way 'round.

And that's when it got ugly. One of the other players is usually a decent guy, but he's also the type to be a sore loser. Ironically it still goes in role-playing even if there are no winners or losers in that. He was actually angry that he hadn't figured me out, he was angry that I'd gotten rid of the weapons research, he was angry that I used the last session to leave with the ship that was actually mine (I just hadn't told them that it was only my name on the ownership papers - then again, they hadn't asked). So while I sat there complimenting him for the really cool things he'd done with his character, I got called a whore for the things I'd done with mine.

Do I sense a bit of a skewed balance here? I think so, yes. I didn't want to bring it up during the session, especially since he's not the kind of person to take kindly to being criticized. If I started protesting about it, I'd be labeled even moreso as a whore - only a hysterical one, or a PMS'ing one. Charming. So I let it slide. Talked to the GM about it as he drove me home. He was sad the campaign had to end on that note, but he can't answer for the behaviour of other people, how they behave is their own bloody responsibility. 

I was quite furious, because if there were people who had double-crossed others in that game it was the very person who insulted me so. He was our negotiator, he was our spokesperson. Everytime he got us a job he took some money to himself, that's part of the kind of character he played, and that's fine. In game I didn't know of this, out of game I do. And then I get insulted so badly simply for preventing us all from getting involved in inter-planetary terrorism. Excuse me?

By the time I lay down to sleep, though, I had quite come to terms with the fact that his opinion of me mattered absolutely nothing, so I could sleep with peace of mind. His behaviour was still atrocious, and I was still indignant, but I don't actually talk to the guy other than when we meet for RPing. So what the hell do I care anyway? I probably do care a little bit.... somewhere. But not enough to be truly bugged about it.

But then ugliness turned to something entirely different. Late Friday morning my phone rang. Odd, I thought, who the heck would call me a Friday morning? I wasn't expecting any calls. I was, in fact, still lazing about taking my breakfast in bed. I was quite confused when I picked up the phone to hear a voice I could hardly even recognise. He identified himself and even then did it take my brain quite a few laps to realise who it was. I'd never spoken to him on the phone before - it was the insulting culprit from Thursday evening. Imagine my surprise. I had him pegged as a sore loser, but I never had him pegged as someone who would actually own up to a mistake and come back to apologise.

He admitted he had been rather too much the night before, he was very sorry, and he very much hoped there wouldn't be bad blood between us in the future. He was incredibly apologetic, I was very surprised. I'm fairly certain that had we met face-to-face rather than on the phone he would have been on his knees. The guy sounded absolutely desperate to have the apology accepted. He hadn't slept well at all during the night because of his guilty conscience. I was astounded - I still am to some degree.

We all make mistakes, and goodness knows I've made some myself where a simple apology no matter how heartfelt can never be enough to patch up the damage. But this? When people come crawling for forgiveness for such a simple matter as some words out of line, who would I be to not accept their apology? And it was heartfelt - most definitely so. 

I accepted his apology and we talked a bit more about the campaign and our characters, in much calmer tones than the night before. All in all we had a real nice talk about things. That was great. So for my part the episode is as forgiven and forgotten as it can get in my case. I never forget what people have done, but if they own up and apologize I won't hold their mistakes against them either. So there. No bad blood.

I called our GM to let him know that things had been sorted between us, so he need no more worry about how the internal relationships in his RP-group are working out. He was very glad to hear that. He had had a very embarrassed player on the phone earlier that morning. Apparently the offensive bloke had talked to one of the other players on their way home from the session, and he'd asked him if he thought he'd been a little hard on me. That other player usually can't remember anything if it happened more than 20 minutes earlier but he actually avoided the non-committal shrug this time and said that yeah, he had been a little hard on me. That's saying something. So Friday morning he'd first called the GM to ask the same question, and the GM having talked to me about it the evening before could tell him that yes I had actually been quite upset when we went home. He was then implored to hand out my phone number, so an apology could be delivered promptly and matters could be fixed.

And so it was that a bloke I never talk to outside of game sessions called me with a very guilty conscience and apologised for a screw-up I never would have thought he'd notice on his own. So while I'm still somewhat disturbed that he could sink so low as to such behaviour as that Thursday night, I am very positive about the conscientious person I spoke to Friday morning.

That was a very surreal morning."

"event","I've always objected to mobile phones. I swore I'd never have one - that was until my dad got me one. I hardly ever used it - it was a waste of money. But when you have it, you become dependent on it - I was no exception.&nbsp; And then there's the fact that it's cheaper to have a mobile phone than having a landline.

Anyway. Since my mobile phone got stolen in the autumn I've been getting by without one. It's working out, though I'll admit sometimes I do have situation where it'd be nice to have one.

My main objection to mobile phones is that once you have one, people expect to always be able to reach you on it. Now, I have a life, I have things to do, I have obligations to others. If I am in class, if I'm teaching a class, if I'm at the movies, if I'm at a dinner party I *will* turn off my phone - or at least have it noiseless and won't check it till I get home again. 

This attitude of mine has caused a lot of people to send me text messages asking if I'm angry with them since I'm not answering. No, dear ones, if I'm not answering it could just be that I have better things to do than answer text messages asking what I'm doing right now and text messages telling me that the sender is bored.

I refuse to be available at all times to everyone. I'm a very private person and sometimes I simply want an hour or three in which I don't interact with people at all. In fact, it doesn't really matter what I'm doing instead of being available on the phone, it's the principle of not wanting to be available at all times.

This has caused much annoyance with some of my former acquaintances who found it very insulting that I didn't answer immediately to their query about what I was doing, or who found me selfish because I couldn't drop everything I was doing to give them a page-reference for their homework.

And now, just this morning, I see a headline on the news: It is becoming less attractive to be 'online' and available all the time. A new generation of 'offliners' are developing, a generation of people who want to choose when they're available rather than being thusly all the time.

The news also said that this trend will most likely make these 'offliners' more attractive to the job market. It didn't say why, but I'm figuring it has something to do with the fact that if you're always available it's a sign that you're not doing a whole lot of meaningful things in your life. Exactly the argument that my former acquaintances could never grasp - I'm doing something important during which I will not be disturbed.

Oh my goodness! That's what I've been doing for the past 10 years or so. I'm becoming trendy. Gracious me! Or rather, the trend is becoming the very thing I've been doing all the time.

And I'm possibly the least trendy person you can ever find.

I love the irony of this..."

"event","I just saw this one titled ""To the nice guys left"" and being a regular at www.Heartless-Bitches.com the whole nice guy concept has another meaning for me than it has for many others. I am fully aware what people mean when they say ""a nice guy"", but this list just annoyed the crap out of me.

I'll start with the finale of this blog post chain spam thingamajig:

"" This is one bulletin for you...
 
 Not many girls appreciate nice guys anymore... And because of this, there are not many left out there...
 
 If you are a nice guy repost this with ""Nice guys finish last.""
 
 If you are a girl that thinks every guy should try to accomplish even a few of these repost this with: ""To the nice guys left.""""

Yes, this is just brilliant. Everything that came before this was the definition of those who should take this to heart. And these four lines make&nbsp; up the actual bulletin... three lines if you don't count the one that claims this to be a bulletin.

I wonder who actually wrote this... any sane girl do appreciate the truly nice guys, this kind of post makes me wonder whether nice actually means what it's supposed to. Then again, being nice is not the only character trait a girl would want in a guy, so no, it's not enough to just be nice, a little personality would be good, too. And a bit of intelligence while we're at it.

Anyway, onwards to the long list of defining traits that came with this post; taken apart bit by bit:

""To every guy that regrets hurting or losing her.""

Anyone who doesn't regret hurting another person isn't worth much as a human being to begin with. Why give a guy credit for some of that basic humanity we ought to expect from everyone who isn't a serial killer?

Anyone who regrets losing another person needs to think about why they consider a person a thing one can lose rather than a person who left of their own volition.
 
""To every guy who knows which girl he wants.""

This is hardly a trait of the good guys'. Many serial rapists and killers carefully pick out their victims and know exactly who they want. Knowing what you want isn't the same as being willing to treat them right.
 
""To every guy that's said, ""You're beautiful.""""

Anyone can say that. Some will say it in order to get laid; many even. Some might mean it, too. It is far too easy a compliment. Anyone can compliment another's looks (sincerely or not), whereas a compliment on their accomplishments would actually mean they'd have to learn a little about the person. Once again: giving guys credit for what we expect as mere basics for everyone else... interesting.
 
""To every guy that was never too busy to drive across town (or across the state) to see her.""

Ehhh, does this only apply to people who have neither school, job nor family to take care of? Anyone who has a life will sometimes be too busy to drive several hours for a random visit. If a person can make that drive at any time of day (or night) I'd be worried, because unless they have a seriously good reason to be able to do that it sounds like they have no life at all and might very well turn out to be parasites.
 
""To every guy that gives flowers and a card when she is sick.""

What do flowers and cards help when you're sick? Flowers and cards mean nothing when you're in bed with a clogged nose that can't smell the flowers and runny eyes that can't read the card. No, what's good when you're sick is someone who'll come make that chamomile tea for you and read to you from a good book - someone who'll come and be there. Flowers and a card is usually just an excuse for not being there in person.
 
""To every guy who has given her flowers just because.""

This one may actually apply. But expand it to 'gift' rather than 'flower'. Flowers only appeal to a select group, but random gifts for no specific occasion are always nice to receive. And it goes both ways, too.
 
""To every guy that said he would die for her.""

They were spouting romantic nonsense. It is once more something anyone can say. And it's one of those wonderful statements that most likely will never be put to the test. That's what makes it so easy to state.
 
""To every guy that really would.""

It's one of those things we aren't able to really tell until we've been in the situation. And until there has been such a situation I'd be wary of anyone who means this. If they are willing to throw everything away just for you, then they can't have a whole lot of other meaningful things in their lives, so here we are again with them not really having much of a life outside of this ""lucky"" girl.
 
""To every guy that did what she wanted to do.""

If it was impossible to find something both wanted to do, one might start wondering why they're together at all. But once again, it's a compromise that we never give other people credit for, why give the guys points for it? Sometimes we won't get to do what I want, sometimes we will and vice versa, that's how things work. If on the other hand the guy always does what she wants to do and never gets to choose any activity himself - that guy needs to grow a spine and wonder what he's doing with that girl.
 
""To every guy that cried in front of her.""

That has nothing to do with being nice. That has to do with having the balls to show emotions. 
 
""To every guy that she cried in front of.""

I cry at almost every single Disney movie... it's no big deal. 
 
""To every guy that holds hands with her.""

Anyone can hold hands... it's not that hard. Don't start thinking he's all wonderful just because he'll hold hands. Anyone who's just after sex or worse can figure out how to hold hands and can do it if it'll get them what they want.
 
""To every guy that kisses her with meaning.""

How does one do that?
 
""To every guy that hugs her when she's sad.""

How about a hug when she's happy? A hug of congratulations when she did well? A hug of ""see you later""? What happened to random hugs when you feel like it?
 
""To every guy that hugs her for no reason at all.""

Ahhh, there it is... good.
 
""To every guy who would give their jacket up for her.""

If the girl is too stupid to dress for the season one would wonder what he's doing with her anyway. 
 
""To every guy that calls to make sure she got home safe.""

Thanks for the concern, the chances that I got killed in a half-hour drive is nigh zero. Besides, if I didn't get home safe, how the hell would he have reached me on my phone anyway? Just wondering. Any guy that calls after so short a time to make sure I'm safe shows signs of being obsessive. It's not enough to make me run away, but it's a warning sign.
 
""TO EVERY GUY THAT WOULD SIT AND WAIT FOR HER FOR HOURS JUST TO SEE HER FOR TEN MINUTES.""

Those guys clearly have nothing better to do with their lives than sit around and wait. They ought to grow spines and get lives the lot of them.
 
""To every guy that would give his seat up.""

Again, this is something we expect people to do for those who need the seats. This might be confused as common courtesy, but excuse me? Are you saying I'm too fragile to stand up on my own?
 
""To every guy that reassured her that she was beautiful no matter what.""

Was lying and forgot to check for qualities that are actually important. 
 
""To every guy who told his secrets to her.""

He might still have told lies - made up secrets meant to manipulate you. It all depends on the secret - don't be so quick to hand out points.
 
""To every guy that tried to show how much he cared through every word and every breath.""

He apparently had nothing more interesting to talk about. I wonder how long she could stand listening to the unending worship.
 
""To every guy that thought maybe this could be the one.""

*snort*

""To every guy that believed in her dreams.""

For lack of belief in his own? Believing that she can succeed? Or supporting her in the attempt to achieve the dreams? Might this be another of those things we expect from everyone whom we consider friends? I think so.
 
""To every guy that would have done anything so she could achieve them.""

That guy is clearly once again too busy with her life rather than his own. 
 
""To every guy that never laughed at her when she told him her dreams.""

Common courtesy again. It's expected that people don't ridicule you when you tell them your dreams, why give your potential significant other extra credit for doing something so standard?
 
""To every guy that walked her to her car.""

Again, walking a guest to the door or to their mode of transport is not uncommon, it does not warrant extra points.
 
""To every guy that gave his heart""

How do you determine whether he has given his heart? How do you actually check whether he's telling the truth when he says he has?
 
""To every guy who prays that she is happy even if you are not with her.""

Once again giving points for something so standard. Goodness, I hope that everyone will be able to accomplish their hopes and dreams and be happy as a result of that. Why should this give a guy bonus points?
 
""TO EVERY GUY WHO DOESN'T CARE HOW FAR
 AWAY SHE LIVES, HE WILL STILL DATE HER""
 
Depends, depends... if someone's not cut for long-distance relationships then that's that. It doesn't always come down to willingness, but sometimes simply to ability.

***************************

That was the entirety of it. It makes me wonder - it really does. I mean, with this list a guy has a comprehensive list of how to get a girl and if these things are truly the things a girl wants, then he doesn't even have to get to know her. And then again, I figure when it comes down to it most girls are repelled by a repugnant personality no matter how many of these things the guys fulfill. Is it really such a wonder that some of the potentially good but somewhat clueless guys feel let down? They've been promised the moon if they can live up to these things, and if you ask me this list is very very easy to live up to, but it never seems to be enough.

Come on, girls, get real. Whatever it says on this list, what girls want is someone with whom they have the right kind of chemistry, someone they can count on, someone who won't smother them in over-protectiveness, someone who will respect them for who they are, someone who has something of their own to add to the mix. In short: a decent person, with a fully developed personality and life, without any traits that belong on a psychiatrist's couch, such as obsession and inferiority complexes.

Bah. What have we come to when the girls are actually re-enforcing the guys in their victim mentality? Nothing good, that's what."

"event","It had been agreed upon with my folks that I'd borrow a soprano recorder they've had lying around for a while. The reason for the sudden need for a soprano recorder is that I'm helping out with two concerts next week, where others have bailed out and it leaves the ensemble a few hands short.

So I'm filling in and needed a soprano.

When dad stopped by this morning he handed me the recorder and said that he'd had it lying around for so long, so he'd decided that... now it's mine.

Awesomeness. It's made of olive wood, which gives it a wonderfully soft and round tone. It's an absolute darling. Olive wood is pretty, too, with its stripes in greenish shades. So I'm all weeeee about it, right now :D

I love it. I'm currently working on getting it played into shape for the concert on Tuesday. Recorder usually take two weeks with no more than 20 minutes of play per day to get them in shape from new. But I'm taking 20 minutes twice a day - morning and evening - to force it to come around a little sooner. I'm looking very much forward to the result. A recorder expert who tried this one told us that this one will be a terrific recorder when played into shape.

I'm very excited :D"

"event","I am looking for a kind soul to adopt a rabbit I found and give it a good home. It's been living out in the wild (suburbs) for a month, possibly longer, with no food, due to someone's carelessness.

Looks similar to the other one I found:

If you're interested in adopting it, email me or leave a comment."

I crocheted this for the Free People Valentine Swap a couple of weeks ago. I've never done a swap before, and I don't really make stuff for other people. I am not a hardcore crafter - I crochet and knit once winter rolls around, and I don't finish 90% of what I start. So something new. It was fun, but I totally waited until the last minute to actually make it. Good thing my swap partner was only a few miles away.

Someone said, ""You should make a bling necklace!"", and I thought that was so cool, especially since I was thinking, you know, doilies and feathers and other girly, unoriginal shit when it comes to Valentine's Day. I wanted to actually have some diamond-looking stuff on it, but I couldn't find anything that wouldn't end up looking gaudy.

And the box idea I got from an old MS Weddings. (I know what you're thinking, and the answer is ""NO"") So I have to credit Martha for coming up with all the good craft ideas, and inspiring me to making stuff with my hands again."

"event","The U.S. Senate is about to vote on S. 1955, better known as the ""Lose Your Benefits Bill,"" which would allow insurance companies to ignore state laws that protect health coverage.  Women in every state will lose benefits.

Among hundreds of other procedures and medicines, contraceptive coverage is on the chopping block.  Hard-won laws in 23 states require health insurance to cover birth control, just like they cover other prescriptions.  If the bill passes, women in those states -- you might be one of them -- could be forced to pay out of pocket for their birth control.  Many would no longer be able to afford it, and some would simply go without.

Besides fair coverage for contraception, here are some of the other benefits that women could lose:
cancer screenings
mammograms
maternity care
the ability to go straight to your OB/GYN when you have a problem
the ability to stay with the same doctor throughout a pregnancy
infertility treatment
osteoporosis screenings

We cannot let this happen -- urge your senator to vote against S. 1955.
Stop the Senate from ending birth control coverage protection for millions of women.

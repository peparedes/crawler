"event","All anyone ever wants is to be happy... am I right.  No one sets out doing something saying to themselves I am doing this to be miserable... it just doesn't work that way.


Well all I wanted was to be happy and I thought it was going to make me happy and I guess I though it was or at least was for a short time.  But now that I sit here and look back on the whole situation I come to realize I was never really happy.  I guess I though by making you happy it would make me happy but all it did was make me miserable, miserable may be to strong of a word but sad isn't a strong enough word.  Somewhere in the middle I guess is where i am.  I sit here and laugh about everything in the past but all I really want to do is cry.  Why would I ever think it was the right thing, I guess I was just hoping and holding on to a little piece that everything would turn out great in the end. I knew it would never but a girl can dream can't she... thats all it really was a dream that would never and could never come true.  I hate the fact that I let myself be in that situation, it is something I swore to myself that I was better than, well not better than but atleast strong enough emotioanlly to stay away from. But when push came to shove I wasn't very strong at all.  I guess it is easy for one to sit there and tell themselves that they will never put themselves in that situation but what one says and what one does sometimes are two totally different things.  And you really don't know how something will effect you until it actually happens.  I can sit here and say I am through with the whole thing and that I have learned my lesson but I don't know if I am or if I really have learned my lesson."

"event","OK so last Night was the Matchbook Romance, Maxeen, The Matches Show and it was awesome.... by far one of the best show I have been to in a really long time.  When we first got there we though it was canceled or something because there was like no one there.. it was crazy... so first we are thinking ok not that many cars this mean a lot of little 12 year olds.  So we go inside and it was like empty.  It was great hardly anyone there so there was actual breathing room.  

So first on was this band Gibbler that I had never heard of... the were pretty good there a local band so that was cool.  Than it was the Matches who put on an awesome set.  The Shawn is so crazy on stage it was great.  Then Maxeen was on another great set. Tom is so trying to be sting though but it is ok but he can pull it off and pull it off very well.  So after Maxeen finished we went and walked around where we got to meet Shawn from The Matches.. awsome guy real funny too.  The we went to the merch table to see what they had and we got to meet Shannon from Maxeen also really cool we talk to him for like 20 mins.  

Then it was time to go watch Matchbook Romance.... they are so good live.. I loved it.  They played a few new songs which was cool and they played Tiger Lily which made me very happy because it is my favorite song.  Oh yeah and I love how he made fun of bands that call themselves EMO.  It was great he had a good point though.  If Emo is short for emotion and emo bands write about emotion then all bands are emo because all song are written with some kind of emotion about some kind emotion.  

So after the show we were leaving and we meet up with Shannon from Maxeen again he introduces us to Jay the Drummer so after we talk to them we are walking away and they totally scream out the door to say by to us. So when we get outside Shawn, Matt, and Jon from the Matches are there playing on acoustics.  So we stay and watch them for awhile then when they stopped playing we stayed for awhile and talked.  They seem like they would be so much fun to just chill with.  Well then it was home and now here I am writing in here once again."

"event","Ok so the past few days have been a whirl wind of emotions... I got in a huge fight with my parents about school and work and of course because they will never admit they are wrong and I won't either and they refuse to see things from my point of view and me from theirs I got very upset and defensive and so did they.  The fight ended with me car less and not returning to Rider next year.  Now when I was told to forget about going back to Rider I had mixed emotions about this.  Now for you rider people reading this don't get mad at me.  I was actually kind of happy that they told me I couldn't go back, but at the same time I was devastated.  You have to understand a few things. The only thing that makes me want to go back is my friends, I have been thinking about this for a while now and as much as I love being there and around everyone the whole class thing just doesn't seem to be for me.  I don't even know if I am in the right major.  I start to think if I should have just done what my parents wanted from the beginning and gone to arts school.  Photography is something I love doing, I love being the the dark room for hours developing pictures.  Getting it how I want it.  That was the one thing in High School that not matter how shitty I was feeling all I had to do was go in the dark room and work on my pictures and it seemed to make everything better.  It is kind of like an escape from reality. I know most parents don't want their kids in art school because there is no definite future in it but thats where they wanted me.    Now I don't want anyone to think I regret going to Rider because I wouldn't change the friendships I have made for anything.  I am just confused in what I want out of life.  And I know I have been bitchy lately and I am sorry but I am just trying to deal with everything and figure out what is best for me and what I really want to do.  Well so back to the fight with the parents after a couple days of not knowing what to say to them and them not knowing what to say to me we finally talked about things and I am returning to Rider next year.  So no need to worry anymore about the apartment girls because we can still have it."

So yeah i miss being at rider and I miss all the people that I would hangout with but you all know this already because well I have either told you or put it in here... but there is one person I miss hanging out with that I haven't told and well i probably shouldn't miss hanging out with and I am really trying not to but so far it isn't going so well.  I never really hung out with this person that much but the times we did were always fun and I miss that.  I guess one reason I think I miss hanging out with them so much is because I know that I will never get to hangout with them again since last year was their last year at Rider.  I don't even know if you read this but if you do I just wanted to let you know that the past year was a lot of fun and I am glad that I got to know you and spend the time I did with you.... well i guess thats it for now"

"event","So last night almost all the Evil's came down and we went out to dinner... Shannon you were missed.

So we went to Pete & Elda's because Kevin and Bryan had never been and well everyone who lives in Jersey should go there at least once.  So Kevin got his ""whole pie eaters club"" Shirt.  Good job (even if you didn't eat the whole thing). After dinner we went back to my house and well we just sat around and talked.  Oh yeah and well I don't know if it was such a great idea but Bryan got Boots the talking Monkey... I hope he doesn't piss Kevin off to much next semester at school... There are RULES for that thing Bryan... you have to follow them I promised Kevin you would. Oh yeah we all went to D&D... it wasn't the same because the guy didnt have our coffee ready for us when we walked in but it was still fun.. I haven't been to D&D since I left school.  I showed everyone some creepy tent things in Ocean Grove that Shannon and I found the last time we hungout... weird little things.

I love the Evils... you guys are the best... I couldn't have asked to find better friends at Rider.  I wish we could all hangout more during the summer but it's hard because we all work and live so far apart... but I guess it's ok because next semester we will either be roomies or we will only be a walk up or down the stairs from each other."

"event","Right so yesterday was monday and I was suppose to go into work at 9 b/c it is my mom's day to open and then I go in later and get to go and ride around on the cart all day and see if I can get the golfers anything... now yesterday when I woke up I still wasn't feel well at all. I was actually feeling worse than I had any other day so I asked If i could stay home a rest.  So I guess after 30mins she finally said ok and this is only because I talk to my dad and he talk to her.  So I spent the whole day in bed.  I guess around 5ish my dad got home and he made me dinner because I hadn't eaten all day because I couldn't and then he left to go out and i went back to sleep.  So then I am guessing around 8ish I don't really know because I didn't look at a clock I woke up with the worst migraine ever.  So i went down stairs and looked at my mom who was looking a little blurry because I couldn't see straight it was so bad and I asked her for something that I could take.  She just looked at me and then continued to watch tv... HELLO.... EXCUSE ME!!!! she just totally ignored me what the hell so me not being able to see straight and I couldn't look at the light because it hurt to much went back upstairs to my room where it was nice and dark... now for those reading this that haven't known me that long when I get a migraine I can't be in a lighted room and I need complete silence and I usually can't see anything because everything is blurry.(sounds fun doesn't it).  So All of a sudden my dad comes running up the stairs to see what the hell is wrong with me because after my mom ignored me I yelled at her and was ""thanks for caring"".  So he went and got me something to take for it and gave me an ice bag to but on my head because I was burning up.... yes well that was my wonderful day off of work yesterday...."

Today sucked to no end... nothing good happened or came out of it.

First I wake up at 3am because I can't breathe and I can't stop coughing.  Then I finally stop coughing but I can't get back to sleep so I curled up under my blankets and just stayed in bed until my my alarm went off at 4:15... than i got up and got ready and was at work by 5am.  So while at work I think I coughed up a lung, had a headache all day, and I went through almost a whole box of tissues. Right so not that being sick and at work is enough to make someone misurable.... no I had to get random nose bleeds... what the hell could something else go wrong and could I feel any shitter....  I hate being sick so much all I want is someone to take care of me and bring me soup but it doesn't look like that is going to happen.... :(

so off i must go.. it's time to try the whole sleep thing considering I got to be at work at 5am again tomorrow"

"event","To some it is only goodbye until one of us gets our ass in our car a drives to the others house to hangout, to some it's goodbye until next semester and to others it is goodbye forever.... I always hate goodbyes and some are harder than others but some are needed.  There are some people that I know I have to say bye to even though I may not want to or be ready to.  I know some of the ones leaving forever I will probably still talk to every once in awhile on line but it isn't the same as running into them in daly's or while walking to class.... to the people I have gotten close with this past semester you know who you are.  The friendships we have built mean the world to me and it is going to suck that I can't just wake up and walk across the hall and hangout with you or walk down to c-wing.  I am going to miss the late nights every night, the random road trips to different places at 4 in the morning, board games, roller blading(don't judge), the fact that we drive 20 minutes to get D&D, the great talks and the funny conversations.... I guess I am pretty much just going to miss everything and everyone.... love you guys we have to try and get together as much as we can this summer because I am going to be going through withdraw of you guys and I will need my fix of the FAILURE moments and DON'T JUDGE actions."

You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again
Think again my friend
Go on misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

Giving everything you want and need. 
I can't believe I did it all for nothing. 
Now I'm bitter I can't take no more. 
Don't blame this on your bad childhood.
That doesn't justify what you did to me. 
You kissed me then dissed me and then you say you miss me. 
You used me, confuse me but you don't want to lose me. 
Don't talk to me.

Listen up people this is to everyone that I have hurt and caused pain to.  I'm sorry I never meant to, trust me. I know in some cases it is to late for a sorry and sorry isn't even close to what you deserve but It's all I got.  I am especially sorry for the pain I have cause the people who are closest to me I love you guys with all my heart even though some of you haven't been in my life all that long you guys are my world."

"event","Right so I am sitting at work bored to no end....  I got up at 4:30am and well my friends back at school hadn't even gone to bed yet.... this whole working before the sun comes up sucks.  I mena really folks I work at a golf course you can't really golf before the sun is up.  So why I ask you do I have to be here so frickin early.  

Yeah there hasn't been much to write in here. My whole week seems to consist of doing the same things every night we take road trips, we go to D&D and  Denny's, and play board games.  I really need a change here folks.  Don't get me wrong I love doing these things but If I don't start doing something different I am going to start to hate doing these things.

Yeah so You all know I work for my parents and well this would seem like a good thing except for the fact that they don't pay me.  I do get tips though so I do have some form of income.  So yeah my mom made a deal with me.  I give her $10 everyday I work and she puts it in an account for me that I can't touch until the end of the summer and what ever I have at the end she will match.  This way I will have money for the time when the cafe is close in the winter.  And since I will be living in the apartment next year and I won't have a meal plan at Daly's she figures this could be my money for food shopping and stuff for the apartment.  Yeah so on top of giving her $10 each day I work I am saving all my change and I am going to try to put and extra $20 a week away just so I have spending cash.  Ok well this is my plan for saving now all I have to do actually save which always seems to be my problem.  I am trying to think of it this way if I work 5 days a week for 4 months that means I give my mom $50 and she puts in $50 so if I do that for 4 months thats  $1600 then by me putting and extra $20 aside thats another $320, then all my change.  Ok  have a goal now and it is to go back to school with $2000 saved.

Oh ok on a side note about the apartment.... Lauren and Michelle my mom said she has a coffee table we could have and a end table I don't know if you guys want them just let me know so I can let her know if she should keep them or not.

Drama loves me... I have come to this conclusion.  So I am also come to the conclusion that I am just going to stay out of everything from this point on.  I don't want to be in the middle of everyone elses problems.  Don't bring me into them I don't care... deal with them on your own.  If you have a problem with someone don't bring me into I am tired of trying to fix things because it always back fires on me and them you end up being mad at me instead of the person you actually have the problem with.  And to make it fair I won't bring anyone into my problems.  I will deal with them on my own this way I won't hurt anyone that does not need to be hurt.   

The end of the school year is coming up very quickly and there are so many things that have gone unsaid and probably will continue to go unsaid. Which is a shame but I guess thats the way life is.  Maybe it is for the best, maybe certain things are meant to be kept to one's self, maybe in time it won't make a difference if they were not said or maybe in time I will realize that things could have been better if I would have just had the nerve to say what I was feeling.  I really don't like all these what if's and maybe's in my life and I know I could change that if I just would tell people what was on my mind and what was wrong and how I was feeling but it isn't as easy as it sounds so until I figure out how to do so I will just have to deal."

I got to hangout with Amanda a lot this week because she came up to visit me and ended up spending 4 days... which was very cool because since I went away to college we don't get to hangout all that much.  So yeah Amanda finally got to meet all the people I am always telling her about and she loved them all which is really cool.  She got to see what we do at Rider.  

So yeah there is this exit on 195 that I always pass and it has always interested me because the name on the sign says ""COX CORNER""  So one night we were on one of our road trips and we decide to see what it was.  Yeah can we say weird and scary.  It is like a 2 mile dirt road in the middle of the woods.  So yeah once we finally got off the dirt part we were in like farm country.  We almost hit Bambi like 4 times.  So of course the next night we ventured back to Cox Corner.  We also ended up going to Asbury Park to walk around... fun stuff let me tell you.  One day I want to go back while the sun is up so I can take pictures.  Asbury may not be the pretty place but if you take the time to really look at it, it has some really nice buildings.  It by far is my favorite place to take black & Whites of.

To Lauren thanks for making me talk about what was bothering me... I felt better after our talk.  

To Lauren and Michelle our roommate bonding time was great.  Our apartment is going to rock next year I can't wait to live with you two..... you know it just won't be us to living their either... I have a feeling we will always be having someone on the futon."

"event","<P>Right so this week went by rather fast... Went on a few small road trips like we do every week.&nbsp; You know the ones I am talking about... where we either travel 20 mins to the Dunkin Donuts because some believe it has the better coffee or we go to someones home town and do something.&nbsp; Ok so just some things I though were funny from these trips</P>
<UL>
<LI>The bunny on the side of the road that looked like it was going to eat small children &amp; the scream that came from Lauren when she saw it</LI>
<LI>There is no nice way to say this guys....</LI>
<LI>I have a text message... oh yeah I forgot I text myself.</LI>
<LI>Padital... motorcycle.</LI>
<LI>The fights over the front seat.</LI>
<LI>The little spastic Kitten and the puppy who kept running into the glass.</LI>
<LI>He shall be mine... I shall call him Sobe... He shall be my little Sobe...(the little bunny who lives by the basketball courts)</LI></UL>
<P>Ok well that was some stuff from out little road trips... Now on to tell you all about our Road trip to Six Flags America in Maryland.&nbsp; Ok since there was Five of us and we all drive little cars so we had to take two cars. And so we could all talk on the trip each car had a walky Talky.&nbsp; In my car was Lauren, Michelle and me.&nbsp; Then the was Kevin and Bryan in Kevin's car.&nbsp; So we left school around 9am I guess and set out on our adventure.&nbsp; So first we stopped for gas and as we were sitting in the parking lot waiting for Lauren to get her coffee we start throwing a bouncy ball back and forth between the two cars.&nbsp; As I throw it at Kevin's car and It bounce off the car and into the major highway two cop cars pull into the gas station.&nbsp; Right so we are thinking oh shit were going to get in trouble and we haven't even really started the trip yet.&nbsp; But it was all good they just drove right by us.&nbsp; Ok so back to the road.... we drove for what seems like forever when we see all this black smoke in the air.&nbsp; So we are trying to figure out what it is and where it is coming from.&nbsp; So we seem to be getting closer to it and first we thing a car blew up or somethings like that.&nbsp; Then we drive past a wooded area and see that all the trees are on fire.&nbsp; Yeah so we took pictures because how often do you get to see a forest fire.&nbsp; Also on our way there was saw the pretty Mustang so of course we took pictures of it.&nbsp; Yeah the guy driving the truck that was carrying the Mustang had a Mullet which made it oh so much cooler.&nbsp; Ok so we finally after like 4 hours of driving get the Six Flags.&nbsp; The time we spent in the park was a lot of fun we got to go on some different rides and we played a few games.&nbsp; So one of the last things we did before we left the park was go to the show that the characters put on and while we were there we saw Griffin's twin... well the hispanic version of him anyway.&nbsp; This kid had his straight jacket, black shirt and pants, black boots, his hair, he was even carrying a cd player around with him... Kind of creepy to think there is more than one of them out there.&nbsp; So much for him being an original person.&nbsp; So we get back in our cars and start to head back home.&nbsp; We get this bright idea to play car tag which was interesting.&nbsp; Lauren explains the game to us like this.&nbsp; Two or more cars through food or what ever they can at each other while driving, you get more points if the window is open and you hit the person. So of course you know being the mature group that we are we play the game.&nbsp; I believe the final score was girls 3 boys 2.&nbsp; And best hit goes to Lauren for her peanut butter cup throw that hit Kevin's windshield. Ok so that game ended when the boys ran out of stuff to throw.&nbsp; Then it was just pretty much quit driving time with a few things said every once in awhile.&nbsp; Yeah so the radio picked up some girl saying that the Peter Pan bus was being pulled over so we of course are looking for this bus.&nbsp; About 2 hours later we found it.&nbsp; Then finally we were back at school and it was time for everyone to get back in their cars and head home.&nbsp; All that is except for Bryan who is at Rider all by himself today... poor guy.&nbsp; Yeah so that was the road trip the edited version.... I am sure a lot more funny stuff happened but considering it is only 7:30 in the am and I had to be up at 4:30 am today I am still not that awake and to remember more would take effort and I just can't do that this early in the morning.&nbsp; Guys I had a great time yesterday... we need to have more road trips with a destination.&nbsp; And maybe next time we find a bigger car than a mustang so we can all travel in the same car.&nbsp; No wait I take that back two cars was fun the whole car tag and walky Talky thing made it that much more fun.&nbsp; Oh yeah I put the pics from the trip on the picture page so go check them out.&nbsp; <BR></P>"

"event","yeah so not much going on in my life.... I did though go on a little road trip last night.  So here is a short recap of the trip.... took a detour got lost in the maze of a town.  Finally got out and ended up in farm country where I saw a tractor crossing sign (I want it).  We finally get back to the road that we started on and continued on our way... I get pulled over for doing 35 in a 25 but the cop was nice she wrote me a ticket for Failure to obey signs which is only a $47... not that bad.  So then we drove a found rt18 then from there it was to rt9 than 195 so basically we went around in a big circle around central Jersey.  Got to luv road trip with no actual purpose."

"event","<P>ok so the weekend was pretty boring... I worked... oh joys so much fun not really.&nbsp; Once again I didn't go to work at the diner sunday night. I don't think I have ever worked a sunday.&nbsp; Well at this point it doesn't matter because I have to quit.&nbsp; So yeah this coming Saturday the Kroner Crew is taking a little road trip to Maryland to go to Six Flags America should be fun.&nbsp; Then this coming monday my friends from home are coming up for my birthday YAY i am so excited.&nbsp; The thing that I am most excited about though is the fact that my home friend and school friend finally get to meet.&nbsp; I love mixing my friends.</P>
<P>OK so yeah for my birthday my mom bought me rollerblades... yeah so I don't know how to rollerblade mostly due to the fact that I am accident pron and I have broken my wrist 8 times a 6 times had to do with rollerskating or ice skating.&nbsp; So yeah the reason she got me them was because that what I asked for. I want to learn.&nbsp; So sunday night I begged Bryan to take me Roller Blading because well when i get something new I must use it right away.&nbsp; Yeah so I learned a very valuable lesson ""Don't skate against the wind when you are just learning"".&nbsp; So we ended up in the fine arts building because it was way to cold out.&nbsp; Yeah I don't think your allowed to skate in the academic buildings but we did it anyway.&nbsp; I had fun even though I suck but with enough practice I may one day get better.</P>
<P>Today, well i guess actually yesterday since it is after midnight I had to go home for a little and I didn't want to go by myself so I made Bryan and Kevin go with me.&nbsp; I know they probably really didn't want to go home with me but they got a home cooked meal out of it so I am thinking it was a good deal.&nbsp; Yeah so they got to meet my parents and well from that they finally understand why I am the way I am.&nbsp; Trust me people if you have meet my parents you know and if you haven't well lets just say it would explain a lot.&nbsp; They tried to steal my cat... not cool guys you know if you would have said you wanted the dog or the bird I would have been all for you taking it but not the cat especially because she is my favorite. After dinner I took the boys to the Java Joint. They weren't that impressed with it but it's ok because it really isn't about the coffee it's the atmasphere... well it wasn't tonight because every high school was there but when you go with a group of people trust me it's a lot more fun.</P>
<P>Right so while at the Java Joint I was looking at my cool coffee cup and I decide it had to be mine... so I Kleptoed it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah that has been a common thing lately. I have some much stuff in my room that has been kleptoed from several places we have gone.&nbsp; I think I shall name a few so you get the picture.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Margarita glass from Chevy's</LI>
<LI>Straw de-spencer from the movie theater(which by far is the best b-day gift)</LI>
<LI>Sign from Dunkin Donuts</LI>
<LI>Pepper shaker from Denny's</LI>
<LI>Coca Cola holder that holds the salt, pepper, and sugar from Denny's</LI>
<LI>Box of straws from the diner</LI>
<LI>Glass with flowers in it from Daly's from rider b-day.</LI></UL>
<P>Yeah so I definatly have a nice little collecting of stuff in my room and I have a feeling that my collecting is not done growing. </P>
<P>Quotes of the night:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Just call me Klepto Boy..... No wait don't call me that I don't want to be know as that</LI>
<LI>When you hear Moo you think of a cow, when you hear quack you think of a duck, when you hear meow you think of a cat, when you hear bark you think of a cat, when you hear squeaky you think of a door</LI>
<LI>Try and quote that... HAHA.</LI></UL>"

<P>I for one do not want to get mine at Great Adventure.... I would rather take the trip and go to a different park and get the tickets for cheaper.&nbsp; And no matter what park you get the pass at it is good at every Six Flags.... So people who is up for a day trip to one of these parks.</P>"

"event","<P>It's official as of last night.... or should I say early this morning all three of the E.D. Boys have slept in my bed on at least one occasion.... now people don't get the wrong idea here, I have two beds in my room and they slept in the extra one.</P>
<P>So yeah I worked last night at the diner until 3am, oh boy how I love dealing with all the drunk people at Rider on a Thursday night.&nbsp; It wasn't that bad though Kevin work to so I had someone to talk to the whole night.&nbsp; And we had a few visitors that made the time go by a little faster. </P>
<P>So on to the fun part of the night.&nbsp; It was time for another road trip last night.&nbsp; This is not an uncommon thing with us though considering I don't think anyone has gone more than 3 days with out going on one.&nbsp; Usually though we have some idea where we are going to go such as the beach, Red Bank, or someones house.&nbsp; This time though we left rider with no real idea of where we were going.&nbsp; So this trip consisted of Lauren, Bryan, Kevin, and me... of wait I almost forgot Squirt, Mogz, and Gobo came to... <STRONG><FONT size=4>DON'T JUDGE!!!</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp; oh your judging I can tell... <STRONG><FONT size=4>JUDGER!!!</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp; So we started off out trip the way it should be and that is with a trip to dunkin donuts.&nbsp; Lauren though totally missed the entrance the D&amp;D..<STRONG><FONT size=4>FAILURE!!</FONT></STRONG> Of course while we were there the little klepto had to take something, so now Lauren has a window cling thing that say something about hot coffee.&nbsp; After D&amp;D we drove to Lauren's house and tried to surprise her bother but that was a failed attempt.&nbsp; Then it was off to Bryan's house so he could get his roller blades.&nbsp; After that it was back to Rider. I really think with every trip with return later and later this time we didn't get back till around 9am.&nbsp; So then it was off to bed until 4pm.&nbsp; Then it was home and that is where I am right now.&nbsp; Oh yeah thanks Kevin for taking the flower thing for me.</P>

"event","ok well I had this really nice journal entry done and then my computer decided to be an asshole and freeze on me so I lost it. So I am going to give this another go a little shorter this time but you will still get the idea.

Sunday : worked at the cafe, was suppose to work at the diner but I fell asleep.  Got my Sobe Key Chain back fair and square I don't care what you say I didn't steal it I won it back.  Added new games to the stack in the room.  We know have Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders... DON""T JUDGE.  There are no board games like the ones from when we were kids.  The first ever game of YOTHELLO was played, not as good as an idea as it sound but still fun.

Monday : Another Road Trip, this one though happened during the day instead of after 1 am.  We went to Red back and walked around for about an hour.  I found the cutest puppy in this one pet store and I told Bryan to steal him for m but he said NO :( Then it was Dinner at Friday's.  After dinner we decide to go see a movie.  I for one wanted to see Jersey Girl and Bryan wanted to see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind so we made Michelle Decide.  We ended up seeing Eternal Sunshine.  It was actually a good movie.  Now back to Rider Kevin joined us and we just hung out until everyone pretty much passed out.

Tuesday : Fun stuff.  The Devils, Rangers game that I have been waiting for ever since the first day tickets went on sale was today.  So yeah everyone knows on the Turnpike it splits at 15 and you either have to go East or West for the rest of it.  Well I wanted to go West but I ended up going East.  This was not such a good thing. We got lost for about 30 mins.  Don't worry people we made it to the game in time so nothing was missed.  I won't go into detail about the game because it upsets some people ::cough:: Bryan ::cough::  I will just say it was a good game.  Oh well there was this little boy sitting a few rows in from of us who had a dance for almost every song that was played it was so cute, he also had a little cheer he had made up it goes a little something like this ""If you know the Ranger suck clap your hands, If you know the Rangers blow clap your hands, If you know the Rangers suck and blow clap your hands""  Now I guess if you are a Rangers fan this isn't that funny but I thought it was.  Than there was the little girl after the game who asked her dad ""if a team was so bad if they would disappear"" then she adds to that by saying ""I wish the Rangers would just disappear"".... don't kids say the cutest things.

Ok well it's time to go so.... bye"

<P>Now all day yesterday I was at work wanting someone to come visit me and of course no one would.&nbsp; So I finally leave work and go home where I had a 3 hour ADD conversation with Bryan where we both were saying how extremely bored we were.&nbsp; So I guess around 10pm I decide that I am going to go to sleep because I have work in the morning So I say bye and start to get ready.&nbsp; Not even 10 mins later I get an IM from Kevin asking me what I am doing the rest of the night. They got the bright Idea to come visit me. Now don't get me wrong guys I luv hanging out with you to all hours of the night, it's always a fun time but I had to be at work by 6:30am and I have to work till around 4:30 pm plus I get to go back to school and work at the diner until 2:30am.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I guess it was like a little before midnight when they finally got to my house.&nbsp; Now I was thinking they would stay a couple hours that I could handle than I would end up getting at least 3 hours of sleep and I can function on 3 hours.&nbsp; Oh was I wrong. They ended up staying till 5am and since I had to wake up and start getting ready at 5:30 I only got 20 mins of sleep.</P>
<P>Kevin got the bright idea of burying Bryan underneath all my stuffed animals, why I dont know and I don't think we will ever know but it was entertaining and gave us something to do for a good 10 mins.&nbsp; Bob&nbsp;signed my wall and There will be no writting on THE Bryan.&nbsp; Judger, I told you not to judge but&nbsp;you&nbsp;went ahead and did it anyway.. thanks buddy.... oh at some point during the night the sobe key chain was stolen back... this is not cool guys not cool at all.&nbsp; Mark my words I will get the Sobe Key chain back it will once again be MINE!!</P>
<P>I know I have probably said it like a million times but thanks for coming to visit me I had a lot of fun... you guys are the best.... luv ya lots :)</P>"

"event","Ok so it is way to early to be up but I had to be at work bright and early today because people golf at the oddest hours of the day.  I think I almost feel asleep before this can not be good it is only the second day that I have worked at the course this season and I already can't wait for it to end.  I really hate that I have to come home every weekend from now on. So yeah of course I walk in to work today and ""trouble"" is here... let me tell you about this guy... i guess he is in his 60's he golfs every saturday, sunday, and tuesday with the same 3 people, he is a very nice guy but he likes to push my buttons he find enjoyment in seeing how long it takes to aggravate me... (now anyone who knows me knows I am NOT a morning person) for instance if I am not working he will call my cell at 6am to wake me up to ask why I am not at work... Why my mother put my cell number on the business cards I will ever know but I really wish she hadn't, or he will buy something take a bite and then come back up to me and be like ""I changed my mind can I have something different"".  I can just tell this is going to be a very long summer and thats not going to be a good thing.

So on to happier stuff.... Wednesday was fun we went to Joe's Crab shack for Lauren's birthday and they made her do the hula hoop yeah not one of her strong points... I don't think she got it around once but it's ok because we still luv ya. So Thursday was Laurens Birthday HAPPY 20th... wow your getting old.  Kevin and I had to work so we couldn't really hang out with everyone until like 2:30 but they came to visit us so that was cool.  Byran and Michelle actually ended up staying until we were done with work.... thanks guys you made work go by oh so much faster.  I did have a very interesting conversation on a cup...I now have a new found sadness for little unloved puppies and penguins poor guys have no one to luv them... don't ask and don't judge it is just better that way.  After work we all went back to Kroner and hung out with Lauren and everyone... Derio of course was already asleep by the time we got back because he is always the first one to pass out.  Shannon had the worst case of the hiccups and her way of getting rid of them was a little odd... she held her breathe until she blacked out.... it worked but I don't think it was that safe.  Friday was well it was another day at rider with nothing to do.  There was one interesting thing though... does everyone remember Fraggle Rock????  Well there is now a Fraggle living in Kroner He was homeless so I brought him back and found him a good home.  Gobo is now living in C2nd and very happy... you better take good care of him or else.... he needs a lot of attention so make sure you give it to him.

Oh wow almost forgot a new game has been invented it is called.... YOTHELLO... it is a combination of Othello and Yahtzee should be interesting."

"event","So yeah I am back to only getting like 3 hours asleep each nigh.  I really think I have a problem. 

Monday night was fun a couple of us went on a little mini road trip.  It started out with us just going to Duckin Donuts for coffee but the coffee sucked and so Lauren had the bright idea to go to the one near her house which is 45 mins away.  So we drive down there just to find out that it closes at midnight... so we turned around and came back to Rider....  

Tuesday was spent playing all types of board games... lets see there was Othello (which is the devil), LIFE(you suck at life), Yahtzee (got to luv that game I never lose), some puzzle game(which will NEVER be played again), and Uno. With a trip to the mall in the middle of all these games so everyone could get Lauren something for her Birthday.  So Lauren and Michelle went to Brown water for a while.  Then Derio came over and hung out with Bryan and me. When Michelle return she brought Kevin with her because he was on break from working.  Than a little later Lauren returned and brought her friend Linny with her.  So all of us went over to the diner with Kevin.  We were just sitting around and than someone got the bright idea to take another little road trip but to where we couldn't decide.  So we finally ended up deciding to go to the Beach and since I live right down the street from the Beach I took everyone to my home town.  We had to take two cars because there was 6 of us so Lauren drove her car and took Michelle and Linny and I drove in my car with Bryan and Derio.  Derio was a little upset because he didn't get front set but he got over that one real quick. So after driving for 30 mins we finally get to the beach.  I had forgotten how pretty and peaceful the beach is at night.  I guess when you live so close to it for so long you don't really notice it all that much.  Yeah so we set up a little blanket and just sat and talk for about an hour I guess... Lauren and Derio climbed the light tower out on the jetty which I don't think was the safest thing in the world to do in the middle of the night but hey.  So after losing all feeling because it was so cold out we headed back to Rider to drop Michelle off because she has and 8 o'clock class.  But we did pick Kevin up and the 6 of us went to Denny's.  Fun times I got a picture of Edger Allen Poe... there is a story behind that one but we wont go into it.  After sitting in Denny's for hours we headed back to Rider and went out separate ways considering it was like 5 in the morning it was time for bed.

Oh wow almost forgot I STOLE Kevin's car!!! Thats right he had it coming though, he should have never help both me and Bryan you either pick one or just stay out of it.  And really now you left Bryan and me in your room you had to have known something was going to go missing.  So yeah I took his keys and moved his car from the Kroner lot to the Baseball Lot. Now mind you I guess it was around 2 in the afternoon when we moved his car. The best part is he had no idea that we did it.  The only reason that he ever found out was because later that night everyone went to the diner and he was working and I didn't have any money so I asked him if he could just give me food and he asked me what I had to negotiate with.....well I wonder what could I possible have that he would want.  So I look him straight in the eyes and tell him ""Maybe I have your car""... the look of shock on his face was priceless.. sorry buddy it had to be done would you have rather your computer taped to the ceiling because that was the other option.  :)

So today was pretty laid back didn't really do much until dinner time when a few of us went to Joe's Crab Shack... It's a birthday tradition here at Rider we started this year.  For everyone's B-day we go to Joe's and they get a crabby straw and they get to be imbarassed.... Luv ya Lauren and I hope you like your baby Elephant."

"event","<P><FONT color=#330000>Ok so it back at Rider&nbsp;so that means it's back to not getting to sleep at normal times.&nbsp; So today was a fun filled day.&nbsp; I got back around 4ish&nbsp;I guess and went to dinner with Bryan around 6 but I had to hide while in Daly's because I was suppose to work tonight but I really wasn't in the mood to and i wasn't even sure if the diner was going to be open so I tried to be all sneaky sneaky and avoid Josh.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#330000>So then it was back to Kroner and a little later Shannon returned but was locked out of her room because she left her key at home.&nbsp; Followed by that Michelle returned shortly after.&nbsp; The Four of us decided to go to the movies.&nbsp; We went to go so ""Dawn of Dead"".. yeah ok so again me and movies like that don't get along. I am to jumpy for those kinds of movies.&nbsp; Well after the movie we return to good old Rider and Shannon showed us her pictures from New Orleans.&nbsp; Not to much later Lauren returned.&nbsp; Lauren was hungry so Michelle, Bryan, Her and me went to Denny's.&nbsp; That was a fun trip.... Clepto Byran took the salt, pepper, sugar holder.&nbsp; Its actually a really cool holder or least I think it has little coca-cola things on it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#330000>When we got back to Rider Kevin was back from work so the five of us hung out in my room....&nbsp; Yeah so I finally got to play yahtzaa.&nbsp; I know it's probably one of the most pointless games but&nbsp;I like it... I don't think Bryan liked it all that much He seemed to get very upset with the game </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#330000>Oh yeah so again the random drunk people are showing up in my room.... Jeff was drinking with two of his friends and they some how ended up in my room.. why I ask does my door have a sign that says if you are drunk and bored please knock.&nbsp; The one was gone and just kept asking if we wanted to smoke... yeah so I have a new rule for my room if it is past 1am we do not answer the door to anyone.</FONT></P>

"event","<P>Ok so tomorrow I go back to Rider.... break went by so fast... granted it was only a week but still.</P>
<P>Going back should be interesting I have to go and have a meeting with the Dean as soon as I get back because he would like to talk to me about all the stuff that went on at school before break because apparently no one informed him of it, and he also wants to know about the whole thing with the someone hacking into my computer here at home so he can see if there is any way he can help out and make sure it doesn't happen while I am at school. </P>
<P>Ok so there is a bright side of going back to school.... and that would be getting to see and hangout with everyone again. I really missed being able to walk across the hall and hang out with the girls and the late night visits from the guys... I know I may complain about not sleeping a lot but the time spent with you guys is well worth the lack of sleep I get.... Girls it really is just like the song says <FONT color=#660000><STRONG><EM>""The nights that we wasted, Got us through the days that seemed never ending""</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend Dana&nbsp;had this quote as her away message on night and I really liked it so I stole it&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#330099><EM>""Friendship it's about laughing at the same things, really being understood, never running out of things to talk about, being accepted unconditionally, picking up right where you left off, and most of all it's about us""</EM></FONT></STRONG> and if this quote is right and that is what friendship is well then I think we have it made because well it applies to us oh so well. we all find the same stupid things funny you know the stuff I am talking about the things everyone else thinks is stupid, we all try to our best to understand everything&nbsp;that the others&nbsp;are going through and chances are if one of us is going through it at least one other&nbsp;has or is, right running out of things to talk about has never been a problem with us we have got to be the most talkative people, being accepted isn't a problem no matter what one of you do I will always support you 100% and I know you will do the same for me, and well picking up where we left off isn't really a problem because we are always together there is nothing to pick up but even with the short breaks we have from school when we get back to school it is like we never left..... wow ok so I think I am rambling again I guess what I was trying to say is that I am glad I have you guys.</FONT></P>
<P>Well I think it's time to go so until next time everyone BYE! </P>"

"event","<P>I am extremely bored so I am just going to start rambling and whatever comes out comes out. </P>
<P>Break pretty much sucked except for the time I got to spend with the <STRONG><EM><FONT color=#660000>WF's</FONT></EM></STRONG> which wasn't much at all which is really upsetting.&nbsp; I really miss hanging out with everyone here at home and I thought that this break was going to be the perfect time to see everyone.</P>
<P>Ok so is anyone else pissed about the fact that it snow during our <FONT color=#333399><STRONG><U><EM>SPRING</EM></U></STRONG></FONT> break.&nbsp; When you think of spring you don't think of snow or at least I don't and if you do than there is something wrong with you. The only good thing that came out of it snowing is the fact that the golf course was closed so I didn't have to go in to work and even that sucks because I really needed the money</P>
<P>I am still rather amazed about the maturity level of some people and how they go about dealing with what is bothering them.... thanks to your childish behavior I could have ended up getting sued for breaking the terms and service agreement.&nbsp; Your so frickin lucky that I called them right away to get everything fixed and I also am really glad that they could give me the IP address of the person who did it... and I am so glad I put that tracker on my links that tells me who clicks on my links and the IP address of the people who click on my links because if it wasn't for that I wouldn't have found out who did it... No wait thats a lie I knew who did it before I found out the IP address but I couldn't prove it.&nbsp; An another good thing about finding out the IP address is it made it easier to fill out the police report because I knew who I was filling it out about. The one thing I am not understanding though is why you did it.&nbsp; Yeah I get it you hate me, well&nbsp;I don't really like you all that much either but you don't see me screwing your stuff up.&nbsp;Well after getting all that out I think it is time to move on.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I re-arranged my room again and started to cleaning out the hallway all because I wanted to find&nbsp;a board game and let me tell you I search my house from the basement to under ever bed in the house and the frickin thing was in the box out side the door to my room who would have thought it would be in there really now.&nbsp; Also while looking for it I found a few other games and I am going to bring them back to Rider so there are other games to play besides <STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>monopoly </FONT></STRONG><FONT size=2>(which does nothing but bring out the devil in everyone who plays it)</FONT>&nbsp;and the <FONT color=#009900><STRONG>LOTR puzzle book </STRONG></FONT><FONT size=2>(which if I may add is actually&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;fun except for the one puzzle that keeps falling out of the book).</FONT><FONT size=3>&nbsp; I think I am bring back <STRONG><EM><FONT color=#336666>Jenga, Yahtzee, Life, and Trivial Pursuit.</FONT></EM></STRONG>&nbsp; Also I talk to Michelle today and she said she is also bring back some games so I am thinking we will have a lot to choose from.</FONT></P>
<P>I finished reading <STRONG><FONT color=#000066>""Fight Club""</FONT></STRONG> yeah that didn't take long.&nbsp; I thought&nbsp;it was going to keep me busy for most of break because normally it takes me a while to read a book because&nbsp;I get side tracked really easily and usually find something more interesting to do than read the book.&nbsp; But I really like this one so it only took me 3 days and it wouldn't have taken me that long if I hadn't had been at work for 2 of the days and had to take breaks to help customers. Yeah so I also thought&nbsp;it was better than the movie which is a big shocker because I love the movie and really didn't think I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;the book more.&nbsp; Well I guess that also could be because I don't usually read the book if I have seen the movie because they are usually different and that aggravates me.&nbsp; Now there were some parts that were different but for the most part they were the same and the parts that were different I liked better in the book.&nbsp; So I guess what I am getting at here is <FONT color=#993300 size=4><EM><STRONG><U>READ THE BOOK!!!</U></STRONG></EM><FONT color=#000000 size=3> Thanks Bryan for letting me borrow it I think I may want to borrow another book if ya don't mind.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Yeah so over the break I got several phone calls from Shannon who was in New Orleans with Lauren and some other people.&nbsp; Got to luv the drunk phone calls at 2 in the morning.&nbsp; My favorite phone call though by far had to be the one when Shannon told me I couldn't get mad at Lauren.&nbsp; she made me promise like 10 times.&nbsp; than she puts Lauren on the phone and she also makes me promise I won't get mad at her.&nbsp; At this point I am thinking something bad happened..... So lauren finally goes <FONT color=#006600><STRONG><EM>""I ate Squirt for dinner... I had turtle soup""</EM></STRONG>&nbsp;</FONT> Now if you have been around for the kidnapping and all the traumatizing stuff people have put my Squirt doll through you will find that really funny and well if you haven't been around for it is still rather funny bu not as funny I guess.&nbsp; And well if you don't find it funny at all you have no personality.</FONT></P>
<P>Ok well I have run out of things to ramble about so It's time to say bye.</P>"

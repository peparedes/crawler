"event","It is now Febuary... yes the month that brings such exciting things as Valentines day!!!  I know I am so excited for this wonderful holiday that means so much to so many people... febuary is also bringing finals week... let me jsut say that i have been waiting over 12 weeks for this blessed time of the quarter.. there is nothing i would rather do that not sleep, study for 8 days straight and take tests for a week!! it is the most fun i have ever had... after this set of finals only about 9 more finals weeks to look forward to... oh joy!!  the only thing keeping me motivated is summer... 

this got me thinking... what am i going to do next year when i have no summer to look forward to?  this is my last summer off... and i have no big plans... all my friends will be working and i will probably work too (of course i need a job first but lets not pull hairs here)... then it is 3 years left of straight school... i guess i get to look forward to going on my externships... i am still hoping for australia and maybe some other exciting place... 

why am i thinking about summer now anways... i have more pressing matters to attned to... i have to pass this quarter... and with two big practicals for the week... i really do need to focus... but i am looking forward to friday night at 7.. i will be done with both my anatomy practical and the dreaded first optometry practical... which i am very nervous about... time constraints and people watching me do not go well for my nervousness or steady hands... i will try my best and that is all i can do... 

well its off to lab i go..."

"event","I once read a little say that said "" No matter where you go, there you are""  I always look at that and think that no matter how lost i am or feel, i know myself and i can find myself... this saying has been coming to my mind recently... i have been feeling lost... just running through the motions of the day... but not really feeling that i am fully active in my own life... i think i am getting warn down by doing the same thing everyday... i need a change... i am not sure what that change is but i think i need it soon... i am hoping that jsut going home for break will be enough time away from here to make me feel better... or may i am jsut feeling this way and tomorrow i won't anymore... i don;t really know...

on a lighter note... i hit one of my optometry teachers today!!  i was going to turn the chair so i could see something and i reached my arm out to the wall to help me turn and Dr. Baker just happend to be walking into the lane and the exact time my arm was reaching in the direction.. oh it was bad.. i hit him right in the stomach... he said that i was the first student to ever hit him... what an honor i now hold... i was so embarassed... he jokingly threatened to call secruity... and charge me with battery... i feel so bad... but hey isn;t that my luck... i am not offically calling myself the most accident prone person... i just need to get control of my limbs... they are wild... 

well off to class"

"event","Today is a blah day... nothing seems to being going the way i wanted... i feel just out of sync today... not sure what thats about... there is strangness between me and some people and i am not sure where this is coming from... i jsut hope that it goes away and that we are better... i jsut think the pressures of school are getting to both of us... 

I have been feeling really cut off from the rest of te world too... i have been so busy that i barely talk to anyone... i play phone tag with deb constantly... and i never talk to megan or chip... and i feel really bad... but i don;t seem to have time.. and if i were to call then i would have to get off the phone within five minutes... i am not really sure what is going on in anyones life... i hardly talk to my mom and i miss out on a lot of things in my family's life... i am missing carissa's 18th birthday and i feel real bad about it... i wish i could go home but i know that i can;t... 

it is really scary to me that carissa is turning 18... i just never thought the day would come that my little sister would grow up... which is fine but i am more worried about her and where she is going in her life... i jsut want the best for her and everyone else and that is all i pray for... and i see carissa going in a dangerous direction and i am so concerned becasue there is nothign i can do.. it is her life... but i know she has great potential but she doens;t realize that she can do anything if she weren;t affraid of change and beleived in herself... so i am left here praying...  i think about when i was younger and protecting my little brothers and sisters was so much easier... now it isn;t and i figure out how to protect them... my liitle baby faced carissa and kelsey are gone and they are gorwing up so fast... can;t we jsut go back to the days of playing in the back yard, laughing? things are so hard these days i think it would be easier... but then again maybe not.. who knows... i guess all i can do is jsut hope and pray that everyone will be okay"

"event","I am feeling much better today... i think it has something to do with the weather.... it is 40 degrees out and sunny (or it was during the day)  I am still feeling overwhelmed but not as bad... 

Last night I didn;t get much sleep and I talk to Nina in my sleep... it was actually really funny.. I was having a dream that she was talking to me about who was taller than me in our class... and i actually rolled over and said out loud that this one girl was taller than me and continue to name people in the class that we my height or taller.. the best part was that nina was actually still awake.. and she didn;t know that i was sleeping because i had my eyes open and my glasses on... she said that i seemed really concerned that there were people taller than me and i was concerned that their pupils are too big because they too tall... it was really funnny... i haven;t had a conversation in my sleep for a long time and i think it has to to with stress... 

I had observation today... it was ok... nothing really exciting happened... there was one attending tho that i thought was really cute and i hope that when i get into clinic i will have him as an attneding... i had to wait for an hour for a patient that i could observe which i was upset with for a little while then i realized that i got to stare at the Doctor... he was really smart and that made him even hotter!!!!  but anyway... no more daydreaming about hot attending doctors....

back to my life of studying and writing papers..."

"event","The snow here is crazy... i almost fell walking across the street everytime... who would think that walking across the street would be so dangerous?  Nothing really happened today... I was in lab for 4 and half hours and i am still not done with my homework.. plus all the other shit i have to do... i am very pissy and very overwhelmed... this is the first time i was doubting that i can make it.. which is ironic considering yesterday i was feeling so confident.. i jsut feeling low today... tomorrow will be better..."

"event","Oh how funny the world is... isn;t january more than a week?  today is a good day... I had last night off to relax a little and i am feeling like i can make it through the rest of the term... i am not sure how long this feeling is going to last. but hey i am going to go with it... i might just be on a caffiene high.. a large cup of moutnain dew can do that to a person... life is good...

my weekend doesn't look so promising... there is a lot to do with little time to do it... what happened to the time when weeks were free of studying and homework... and it was a time to catch my breath and take a break from school work? not anymore... i don;t really get to relax on the weekend and if i do i feel guilty for not studying...  but then when i look back at all i have learn in a short amount of time i am very excited and impressed at what i have done... before i came here i was worried that i wouldn't make it through the first quarter because everyone else ( i thought) had more experience and had more knowledge than i did... i was so worried about it that i almost didn't apply and then i almsot didn't come... but now i am here and i am doing better than i ever expected and i am happy here despite of all the work and stress... this is where i am supposed to be... and its a feeling that is hard to describe... i am not only in the right place but heading in the right direction in my life... and i have never felt that way...  its funny how things work out... i could have been going in a completely differnet direction with my life if i had not come to this school... i wouldn't be in chicago... i wouldn;t have meet the great new friends that i have... i might not have kept in contact with my friends... i don't know... i really feel lucky... i talk to deb more than i have since we first became friends... she is like my second mom... she worries about me... get excited when i do when and listens when i jsut need to vent... i don;t know waht i would do with out her and i am not sure that would have happened if i didn;t come to ICO... and the distance between b and i has shown that our friendship will survived all the changes that both our lives will go through... we are both independent people that love to move and not exactly sure where i lives will take us but we will be friends through it all... and megan and i am now dealing with trying to maintain the great friendship we had at augie with our very differnet lives... it has been rough but i think that once she sees that there is room for me in her life and there is room for her in my life things will be better.. but til then i will give her the space to find out that.. and then we will be back!  and then there is chip... the one person i know that no matter how i am feeling... he can make me smile... and i am so very grateful for that... so like i said life is good... 

I really jumping around... gotta love Moutain dew!!!!  oh well... now i have to go focus... i needed to get some of this energy out of my system..."

"event","This morning was an early one... I was at at 6:30 after only going to be 5 hours before..  By 7:00 i was trying to cram all the last minute info i could about pyhsiology... it wasn't sticking... I wonder why as an eye docotr do i need to know what prolactin does or melatin or what type of cell secretes specific hormones?  But I guess i already know the answer.. Because its on the National Boards... but why am i wasting my time learning stuff for one test (and paying big money to do it) so that I can forget it and never use it again?  I guess i should stop complaining... I got off subject tho... 

Back to my day... so 8:00 rolls around and I am taking the physio test... and within 15 minutes i was done.. so all that time i spent stressing was not needed.. but go over the test... and i think i did alright... most of my time was spent thinking about how jenny was doing on her test... i know it sounds strange but i spend more time thinking about how she will do on particular questions than i spend answering them... I know that she will be a great doctor... so my goal this year is to get her to make it through... and I know she will....  Ok.. so i finished the test and then it was off to study for the anatomy quiz that i had barely studied for that I was to take in less than 20 minutes... but who wants to study right after taking a test? not me... but i think i did fine... 

Then the thing a dread the most happened... i got my eye dilated... yeah yeah  you think its nothing... but when you still have to read and focus and its only one eye its not so fun... plus add into it the fact that i have a bright light shined in my eye for atleast 30 min straight... FYI I have cataracts... thanks eileen for pointing that out ;)  

Then it was off to optometry lab for a another quiz.. i had to cover my right eye in order to take the quiz... fun times that was...  then i sat for another half hour- 45 min while another bright lgith was shined in my eye.. so here i am with a major head ache... tired... and i still have to go to class... and type a paper... and study... but aleast i have survived the day of quizzes and bright lights"

"event","I am going to try this... I am not sure how this is going to go... my life is not that exciting and I don;t really have much time to think about how i am feeling today.. but hey i will try... 
Today I am really tired and I still have to study for a major test that i am no way ready for... i think i am not going to do well on this test... but its a good thing... i need to realize that a B and even a C is ok... right now i am putting a lot of stress on myself to keep up the A's that i am wearing myself out... But i can't really complain i am doing well... I now wonder how i would have done at Augie if I applied myself like i have here... 

So ya... i hate physiology... it sucks major... i have to go to class...

this was just a test to see if this will work..."

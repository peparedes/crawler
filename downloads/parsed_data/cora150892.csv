"event","I have to find this funny that I logged on here and if it was a book it would be very dusty because its been a year and when reading my last post I realised something a year on and I am still saying that I am going to focus on my weight and go have a one week detox plan that week has yet to come.

I am fed up with blogs I cant keep up with them I have a bout 10000 or well thats just what it feels like.
I can not say like last time that I will keep up with this one as I as you probably know already am not true to my word.

Tommorow I go to party in the park in Leeds - Temple Newsm with Mel.M gunna be fun I just hope Mel likes at least one of the people who go I personally am looking forward to the headliner M.J Blidge.

In the last year not much has changed I have become an Ipoder hopefully I wont have a future like the Simpsons predicted with mine.
I am sill your acting,day-dreamer who likes taking photographs with her new camera and thinking of cool ways to right a book.
The last thing like many others I have been planning for many years now.

Prefesions are beginging to get to me I think that is because I am loosing the point I just dont get it anymore I was at the opening of Harry Potter and the order of the phonix then I read the next book The half-blooded prince in 1 and a half days and now I am here anxusly awaiting the next and final Harry potter book planning how I am going to make a fan music video from Harry Potter & also thinking (if that aint enough) weather I should right my own book but then reality sure enough checks in and I begin to see the point my mind has been making out to me who would want to  read the shit that you personally put in front of them and that is just one of the reasons I am not on a word document now.

Personally Signed 
Cora"

www.the-island-of-lost.piczo.com
i wish it was not piczo but it is the only free one i know some people have a .com or .co.uk but as far as i know they cost some $$$$.
an the people who do them aint 13yr old kids just trying to share there love of the program with the world.
well some of them are doing the 2nd one yesss.
been trying to get a free 30day trial of paint shop pro as well i aint on mission impossible or anything but the crap thats been giving me yoo would think it is.

cant wait to get lost season 2 part 1 on dvd comes ou the 17.7.06 bought the magazine today an its really hitting me my addiction.
evi lilly is the best her charm and lovly smile that she brings onto the show with her charictor having such a meaningfull role.
cant wait to season 3 starts i hate myself for reading millions of season 2 spoilers and then watching half of it online but anyway ill get over that i suppose.
desprete housewives over again until october feals like light years away and we are in too much suspence between susan and mike.
and the oc dont start me on the oc i have been in and out of it all three seasons i finally get into it n bang i get told marissa will die i know all yoo americans have seen it. but here in the uk we aint yet thats y i love america yoo can get spoilers for evrything erlie.

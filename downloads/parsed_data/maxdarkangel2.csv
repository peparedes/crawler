"event","Christmas Eve is going to be terrible this year because Grandma won't be there. Christmas Day will be even worse because we don't even like spending time with that family. 

But I&nbsp;haven't been so genuinely happy in a very long time. Phil is a big part of why. It's just so damn nice not to be depressed. And I&nbsp;just feel refreshed and relaxed. 

It's probably been about 4 years since I've been happy at Christmas, and even though this may be the worst one I&nbsp;will ever have, I&nbsp;think I won't have any trouble smiling."

"event","<br /><a href=""http://www.kisa.ca/personality/"">http://www.kisa.ca/personality/</a>&nbsp; &lt;&lt;--- take the test!<br /><br />I took this personality test with a bunch of friends tonight and it is extremely accurate if you really take the time to think through the questions. The test doesn't take too long, i'd say about 10 minutes. Here's my results: <br /><br />I &ndash; Introversion preferred to Extraversion <br />S &ndash; Sensing preferred to iNtuition <br />F &ndash; Feeling preferred to Thinking <br />J &ndash; Judgment preferred to Perception <br /><br /><strong>Characteristics </strong><br /><strong><br />Myers-Briggs description </strong><br />According to Myers-Briggs, ISFJs are interested in maintaining order and harmony in every aspect of their lives. They are steadfast and meticulous in handling their responsibilities. Although quiet, they are people-oriented and very observant. Not only do they remember details about others, but they observe and respect others&rsquo; feelings. Friends and family are likely to describe them as thoughtful and trustworthy. <br /><br /><strong>Keirsey description </strong><br />According to Keirsey, ISFJs, or &quot;Protector Guardians&quot;, are most concerned with taking care of people by keeping them safe and secure. They are modest caretakers who do not demand credit or thanks for their efforts. But while they are essentially very compassionate&mdash;and in fact exercise more patience in dealing with the disabled than perhaps any other type&mdash;their shyness with strangers can lead others to misread them as standoffish. Only among friends and family may this quiet type feel comfortable speaking freely. ISFJs are serious people with a strong work ethic, not inclined to self-indulgence. They believe in being meticulous and thrifty. They work well alone. While they may enjoy taking care of others, they do not enjoy giving orders. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>You can also look at the role variant that goes along with your personality type. I&nbsp;found that mine was mostly accurate, though there were a few things that didn't really fit at all. Here's mine:<br />&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span class=""mw-headline"">Overview</span></strong></p><p>Protectors are observant, cooperative, informative, and attentive. They are greatly concerned with the security of others and they often find assisting the downtrodden or people with disabilities to be satisfying. Protectors also find personal fulfillment in insuring the safety of others and may be attracted to jobs that enable them to do this as medical practitioners or insurance agents. Protectors are also quite skilled at executing routines and this enables them to be skillful in jobs that require conservation skills such as curators or police officers. Protectors are thorough, frugal and they abhor the squandering of material resources.</p><p>Protectors are comfortable working alone and they are often uncomfortable being in positions of authority. When they are in positions of authority, they often try to do everything themselves. Protectors have a very strong work ethic and this can lead them to be overworked. The least hedonistic of the role variants, Protectors are willing to complete jobs other role variants manage to avoid, especially if it enables them to help those in need.</p><p>Protectors often talk about daily life and every day concerns; however, they are not as sociable as other role variants. They tend to be talkative to only to a close circle of friends. Protectors' shyness with strangers can make them seem to be cold even though they are often warm and sympathetic. Protectors are often undervalued as their commitment to security and their economies are often taken for granted.</p><p>Protectors value traditional ways of doing things and are not interested in experimentation or speculation. They deeply value family history, heirlooms and property as well as cultural norms and traditions. Protectors firmly believe in the stability offered by credentials, titles, offices, birth and other forms of traditional authority. Protectors dislike situations where the rules are constantly changing.</p><br />"

And I guess waiting it out made me make sure it was what needed to be done. I don't really know why i'm writing about it here. I'm pretty okay. Just feel terrible about hurting Chris.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hmm, on another note, my sister told me today that she was kind of depressed because people dont feel like they &quot;know&quot;&nbsp;her. That they don't know her passions, etc. I must say, I am the very same way. And I just figured out why. Big passions of mine and Lauren are things like horseback riding, drawing, golf, etc. All these things we can't really share. None of my friends can ride or golf&nbsp;or willingly draw something (except for Laurie who rides, which is probably why we bonded so well) .. so yeah, it's hard to get to know someone when you can't see what it's like to be in their shoes, because you literally can't fill those shoes.</p><p>Sure, people might think i'm a bit closed off or mysterious.. but just learn to ride or golf or draw and i'll open right up.</p>"

"event","&nbsp;Wow. New Year's eve was great. I ate way too much food. Though despite the fact that I had a large number of drinks, none of them had a high alcohol percentage, so&nbsp;I failed to even&nbsp;get a buzz... which was sad. I got to see my amazing friends Brianna and Samantha though. They are pretty much the coolest people ever. I love the random things they say and do. We had two barefoot snowball fights outside.. Lauren was apparently drunk as she was screaming out profanities, likely waking the neighbors. Then the second fight I told her she couldn't swear if she wanted to participate..&nbsp;so when we went outside&nbsp;she kept yelling, ""I'm not swearing! I'm not swearing!"" at the top of her lungs.. I don't think she really understood the point.&nbsp;
Anyway. As the ball was going down we all had some very sweet wine, which I actually enjoyed, but as I still don't care for wine, I gave half of my very full glass to Brianna, who can down anything in a half a second. (One time at IHOP she downed a mixture of salt/pepper/sugar/water... and a different concoction of the four different syrups they have on the table... it wasn't pretty... but it was impressive.)&nbsp;
I think we all went to bed around 1:30am. I was sleeping in the same room with Sam and Brianna though.. and we managed to stay up laughing and making prank calls until 5:30am. Quite an adventure. Ahh, these will be treasure memories.."

"event","&nbsp;Nick has been doing really well, really improving physically. He's muscled up and gained weight. He can do a regular 30 minute lesson without dying. He can go through turns without slowing down. He's going on the bit a lot easier and keeping it easier too. 
Despite all that he's still quite a literal pain. It seems every time I get on to ride lately he has to try to buck me off. I know he's got pain issues, and the cold doesn't help, but there's really no excuse. Well, at least he hasn't succeeded. The other thing is that he requires so much leg to get him going nicely forward and to keep him there, that a few hours after my ride my legs feel like they are on fire .. it's especially painful in the knee, and more with my right leg. It's freaking annoying, and every time it happens it doesn't go away til the next day and I can't sleep during the night because of it.&nbsp; 
Kathy was right today when she said that horse is damn lucky to have me. I love him though, I could never give him up. And I'm just so proud of the progress we've made together.. as slow as it may be.&nbsp;

"event","&nbsp;I don't know about this Mike thing. 

I mean, we've only been on two dates. But that's kind of my point. I've seen him a total of like 6 hours within I don't know.. 3 weeks? It's not like we have to see each other all the time.. but once a week would be nice? And I guess it wouldn't be as big of a problem either if we could get to know each other other ways.. like through emails or instant message conversations, or SOMETHING.. but&nbsp;he doesn't use any of that.&nbsp;The few times I've talked to him on the phone, it's been mostly ""business"" .. just confirming a time to hang out/not hang out.. that kind of thing.. and he usually seemed in a rush, which I'm sure he was probably off to class or something. 

But yeah.. I was looking forward to getting to know somebody new. And he's a really nice, funny, intelligent guy.. but how can I really tell anyway if I don't even know him? 

I just don't know what to think. And i'm not planning on this working out. I'm not going to give up on him, i'll go out whenever he wants to, but I'm definitely not getting my hopes up.&nbsp; 

...sometimes I feel like I need a heart transplant. My heart has gone numb. I just want to feel again. And I'm sick of falling asleep in pain."

Got to see a new House episode which happened to feature a new Alanis song. Or at least one i've never heard. 

Mike couldn't make it though.. but there's always next time."

"event","Well I tonight seemed to go&nbsp;fairly smoothly. He loved the episode of House.. we were trying to guess throughout the episode who House was going to pick for his new staff. And we had some good art class conversation. He's really enjoying his drawing class. It's nice to see a passionate art student who is happily surviving the foundation classes of Hell. He says he'll show me his stuff sometime. He liked my stuff too, I guess he had seen it in the hallway and didn't even realise it was mine until today when he saw it back here in my dorm. *feels flattered*
So anyway, things went well. And we are tentatively planning to do this again next tuesday, or every tuesday. So yay!"

"event","I was thinking today.. you know how people generally have something in mind that they are working towards in life? I mean, it's kind of the thing that they strive for, the thing that they picture as their life goal?&nbsp;

Some people&nbsp;hope to travel..&nbsp;
some&nbsp;hope to find love..
some&nbsp;hope for wealth and possessions..
some hope to climb up the work ladder..
some&nbsp;hope to raise a family..
..and the list goes on.

I just don't really know what I'm striving for. Or I don't know what I'm looking for that I feel like I could realistically obtain."

I've met him/hung out with him a few times, and he's a very sweet and friendly guy, really easy to get along with. He's a good ol' ren faire guy as well, which is a definite perk. So we'll see what happens. Yay :)"

He's just a kickass kinda guy anyway. I mean, come on... throwing knives, free-running, AND art too? Yup. I'll just admire him from afar."

For me to hold you tight
I will kiss your tender lips
And you can stay all night
I will gaze into your eyes
As you look deep in mine
We can forget the world around us
Let loose ourselves in time
You know you mean the world to me
You are my dream come true
Without your love without your touch
My world is always blue
I know that it will break my heart
When its time to say goodbye
But I know that I am not alone
When I sit at home and cry"

"event","My mom thinks i'm antisocial. She said if i don't invite friends over soon that she's going to ground me. She never had a problem with me not inviting people over before when we were in the old house. I have to try out again for cheer next week, I'm so scared. Being in cheer this year has been one of the best learning experiences I could ever have asked for. Although things have been rough, we've gone through 3 coaches, one of which who was shot, a school district who doesn't care about us, a girl who just found out that she has a blood clot in her brain and can't cheerlead anymore let alone do anything, and we still managed to go to nationals. If that doesn't teach you perservance I don't know what does. After going through all the tears, the screaming, the fights, enduring it all and not making it onto varsity again, that would crush me like none other. For once in my life I felt like I accomplished something this year, I managed to be the only girl on the squad to never get into one fight with anyone else, be torn between 3 different friends who were mad at eachother. I've learned so much, about being a good friend, never quitting or giving up when we knew that we were a helpless case. 
We got a new coach who actually knows what she's doing. The school board finally let us get a coach who wasn't a teacher at tucson high already. For awhile we were all ready to just give up because the school told us that we could only still have a team if they found a teacher here who would be our coach, now how many teachers do you know who would just come out of the woodwork and say ""yeah I'm an english teacher but I also know about cheerleading."" not many! We've already had two coaches who had no background experience whatsoever and we were on the verge of giving up because we knew that we would have to continue to be doing everything ourselves, which was fine some of the time except when some girls didn't want other girls to be superior over them and name themselves the leaders. Thats what started all the drama. And we managed to get our bid to nationals all by ourselves when we had to make up a new routine at 9 o'clock t night before competition because two girls were uneligible. Then wonderful Tanisha came along, our new coach. She knows about cheerleading and is so organized, she saved us, ever since she came along, theres been no more tears, no more fights, and we've improved on everything. After all of this, I'd do it again in a heartbeat. The only thing that could work against me is my age, they might say (well she has time) and put me on JV again.    I would be so upset if that happened, because I know that I have improved so much, and never have I once dropped a girl, never have I once started drama, I got hit in the mouth, my mouth was full of blood and I said ""lets do it again"". I've bonded with everyone intensly and I was the most unhappy person when I was on JV, they were horrible people, treated me and a few other girls like (excuse me but) like shit. I understand that with all that has happened with disciplinary problems why they want to do try outs again but I think we've gone through enough."

"event","Life has been so insane lately. I just got back from Nationals, I had the time of my life! It was so much fun,I couldn't have asked for anything better. I was so lucky because while everyone else was assigned to a room with their stunt group my friends and I got to pick to be together! it was party central in our room, we ordered pizza every night, I was so tired because they wouldn't let me go to sleep. But I think I've caught up on sleep, hopefully. 
Things are going well I think. I LOVE school (the social part of it) I can't wait until all my friends can meet, you'd be suprised how many of my friends that go to tucson high have never even seen eachother, ths is soo big. I feel like I'm living this year up so thats good because I really want to live high school to the fullest, meet as many people as possible, and still have good grades. 
I'm really excited because my brother and his friends told me that I can choose any h.s party that I want to go to and they will take me. Otherwise, I'm not allowed to go to those PARTY parties (if ya know what I mean...lol JK.
I feel consumed with my emotions lately. Every time I day dream its about the same thing, I want it to stop. You know when you just fall head over heels over a crush, its the worst feeling ever. None of my crushes have EVER lasted this long, even ask my friends, I'm usually over it in a week or two, but this has lasted like 3  and a half months. If you have any advice on how to get over someone, I need it. He's wrong for me in every way, maybe thats why I like him so much. 
Who knows!
XOXO

"event","hmm, a lot has been going on lately. Testing, nationals is next week (AHHHH)! My parents are talking about moving to New Zealand my junior year (I doubt that will happen) I don't know, I kind of want to. I haven't traveled out of the country much, just once to mexico. I think it would be cool to move to another country and try new things for awhile...it won't happen I'm sure but its cool to think about. 
I miss Carolina! Call me Caro! I haven't talked to you in 4ever! What days and times do you come over to Tucson High for track? I'll meet you out there because I have to stay after school anyways for practice. 
Okay so my friend has this boyfriend and they've been off and on, but they really do care for eachother or at least she does for him. She doesn't know my other friend  but her bf does and he flirts with her SO much, she flirts with him too but  I don't think she knows that he has a gf. So I went to practice today and my friend who has the bf just collapsed on me crying. She was saying how that today at lunch my other friend (which she didn't know) was flirting with her bf in front of her and he was flirting back. And it started all this drama, not between my two friends but between my friend and her bf. Its so sad because they were doing so well until my other friend came into the picture and I feel so bad because at practice whenever my friend hugged me she'd start bawling. So I'm going to talk to my other friend and see if she actually likes my other friends bf and see if things can be resolved. 
I have to march in the rodeo parade tomorrow. I hope it doesn't rain! I can't wait until the summer, my friend lives by me so we decided that we're going to go to the Ymca twice a week and go jogging together in the mornings. She's in great shape because she's a lifeguard but I've been getting worse and worse and I'm tired of it!
I love you
xoxo much love homies

"event","I just wrote 10 paragraphs about my philosophies and I was about to update and my computer froze, soon I will update but I can't go through all that again...today. So I'll just say something brief.
I just want to say how thankful I am to have such good friends. 
I also wanted to say thank you to a certain friend for opening mu eyes to different views and such, and you all may not know it but I learn wonderful things, important things from you everyday. I've learned that all the selfishness and shallow ideals are nothing and to find the deeper part of everyone. You know, I hear these girls and they're talking about how they think thats its okay to be with a guy who only likes the for their body, and I TOTALLY disagree, ""High School is just for messing around,"" they say...I just think thats wasting your valuable feelings on someone who's just using you. 
I also have learned to be yourself. Heres a good example: there was this guy that I had a huge crush on for awhile, and as soon as I discovered that I really did like him, I started to find myself agreeing to things that he said, just to agree with them, not because I actually did...and then I stopped liking him because I couldn't stand how he cussed so much. He used very derogatory words and I couldn't stand it. So after that I just stopped caring what he thought, and now he likes me. And I respect myself enough to tell him that his cussing makes me uncomfortable, and now he doesn't curse in front of me, because he respects me and the way I feel. 
The thing is, I was miserable when I was trying to please him all the time. It's not doing anyone good, and I am truely blessed to have friends who mostly have morals like me and how everyday never ceas to amaze me with their brilliance.
Thank you to all of you,
I love you

You were always crazy like that
I watched from my window,
always felt I was outside looking in on you
You were always the mysterious one
with dark eyes and careless hair,
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
besides some comment on the weather
Well in case you failed to notice,
In case you failed to see,
This is my heart bleeding before you,
This is me down on my knees
These foolish games are tearing me apart
your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
You were always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you,
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of you loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.
So I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn,
Somebody more like myself
These foolish games are tearing me apart your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

Then when I got home, I modeled them for my parents and then tried to think, which outfits to wear on which days and which days were more important to look better. It was REALLY hard and I couldn't decide between these two jeans and I was having such a hard time then I realized that theres no school tomorrow (Monday) the day I was going to wear my new red shirt, and so when I realized this...my life became so much easier and now I know what to wear and when!!

I was thinking that I might fly today
Just to disprove all the things you say
It doesn't take a talent to be mean
Your words can crush things that are unseen
So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way.
You always tell me that is impossible
To be respected and be a girl
Why's it gotta be so complicated
Why you gotta tell me if I'm hated
So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way.
I was thinking that it might do some good
If we robbed the cynics and took all their food
That way what they believe will have taken place
And we can give it to people who have some faith
So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way.
I have this theory that if we're told we're bad
Then that's the only idea we'll ever have
But maybe if we are surrounded in beauty
Someday we will become what we see
'Cause anyone can start a conflict
it's harder yet to disregard it
I'd rather see the world from another angle
We are everyday angels
Be careful with me 'cause I'd like to stay that way"

Its weird especially since they have no way in knowing that I like them, because I don't let them know. ugh, guys should be ashamed of themselves! You're soooo confusing, and you blame girls for it! And I don't know how to act in front of someone who likes me. 

You want to hear something creepy...? I got a phone call today while I was waiting to get into the doctor's office and it was this guy I danced with at formal, but I didn't give him my number...

If anyone wants a free bowling certificate to BedROxx just ask me, because I can't bowl lol, and KRQ sent it to me for my birthday.

Yesterday I decided that boys are puerco y gordo! (fat pigs!) Except the ones that are my friends. But there is this football player named Roshaun and he always wants me to give him hugs, so I do. He's kind of a manwhore though, but anyways. One morning I come into the cafeteria to hang out with my friend kylie and he came over wanting a hug, and so I gave him one...lets just say he did something ""unpleasant after that"" so now he askes me for hugs and i tell him no, he's a creepy guy, now I see why my brother didn't want me talking to him. But I'm proud of myself because I stuck up for myself, and I'll be more careful next time I make a judgement on someone.

	 Winter

One day when it's winter
When the tall oak groans in northern winds
When cruel frost creeps white beneath the bark
And twigs once sappy and green
Shake brittle and dry in the darkening

Then come to my door
Let yellow light spill out
Let me wrap you in warm
Let summer kisses bring back roses

What wingspan glides in the blue August skies
Soar and circle
Paired in gentle harmony, one other
Melt, then--
Be with me"

"event","hm, I'm sick today, but thats okay. I missed school today, and I'm not lying; it felt good. Life has been weird lately. Some of the people that I used to be close too, have drifted apart (if you think this is about you, its probably not.) And people that I never was really close to, I am now. In a way, things are looking up, I have AMAZING friends who I love to death, classes that I love (except for Physics EW), most of the teachers are awesome, but somethings missing. I don't know what it is yet, but I'll be my detective self and find out. 
I'm hungry, I haven't eaten yet, so I'll be going now.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING! I *heart* you all!
Corinne"

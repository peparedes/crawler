"event","So I kinda fell out of updating LJ.  Like Myspace (and FB soon quickly becoming) I got bored with it.  Anyway, where to start...

Operative.com is a great place to work.  Working from home is awesome and the commute into the city every other week isn't bad.  Plus the money is great, but that's never been a real motivating factor for me.  They're looking to send me overseas to hire, train and build offices in Asia.  I'm excited and while I know the time frame, I'm not posting that anywhere (maybe when I get back).  So yeah, work is good!  :) 

This winter has been.... AWESOME!!!  Nothing like back to back storms with accumulation over a foot!  My monster snowblower purchase is beginning to pay off!  I even started building an igloo in the backyard, but it started drizzling so I'll restart after it freezes over.  Feels good to get out and clear our entire street of snow.  There are about 5 older people on our street, so between me and my neighbor, we get everyone shoveled out before they even look out their window.

Jenn is also feeling much better after going gluten-free.  While celiac was ruled out, she feels so much better when not eating gluten based-products that it just makes sense to stick with it.  She was able to try out some gluten-free dishes at our Yule Dinner this year and no one could tell the difference.  Speaking of which, our Yule dinner this year was the biggest and best so far.  Our menu gets bigger and bigger each year that I think next year we'll have to rent out hall to be able to cook everything and host everyone.  This year I made some awesome venison/duck kabobs (marinated the duck in an orange marinade and the venison in red wine/garlic/onion for about a week), a 25 lb turkey, ham, roast beef, lasagna and about 15 other sides including my first attempt at ratatouille.  I got a lot of compliments on that and didn't realize how easy making ratatouille was.

Looking forward to the spring and rebuilding our garden to be groundhog proof.  After replanting the garden 3 times last year after getting eradicated by those punks, I'm making sure they can't get in this year!  I'm also replanting some bushes for a neighbor as I cleared out a huge patch of ivy next to her house in the fall, but I need to put something there as it's pretty bare.  I'll be chatting with Lyss on what plants to pick.  This spring/summer, I plan on setting our garage up with an outdoor bar that's accessible through the window.

Hoping to start up some more musical projects this Spring.  I'm building my own cajon that Jenn bought me this year for jamming by the fire this summer.  I want to help Eric finish his album and replace the programmed drum tracks with something a little more organic.  Then there is the project with Evan and E. Butler that should be fun.  Two acoustic guitarists and me...  Never thought I would tone down my playing so much, but it's really taught me how to be more of a finesse player.  There is a huge festival that their friends host and we may be headlining, so it's a great opportunity to network with other musicians and projects."

"event","So I'm coming up on my 6 month anniversary of starting at Operative.com.  They are a digital advertising company based in NYC.  My department is contracted by Microsoft to place ads on MSN.com and all the sites therein (foxsports, delish, etc.).  I have to say, I've never been happier all-around as I am here.  The people I work with (domestic and foreign) are friendly, happy employees.  The people I work for are intelligent, solution-oriented individuals.  And the company I work for is extremely profitable, growing and aggressively promotes from within.  

At first the idea of working in NYC wasn't that appealing.  It's a great city and all, but the 2.5 hour 1-way commute was daunting.  I stuck it out for 2.5 months for training, but I was exhausted.  Now I work from home and commute into the city once a week for half a day.  I love it.  I've already been asked if there are any other positions they would like me to move into, but with future events upcoming, I like the idea of working nights from home while Jenn works days.  Provides flexibility for future family dynamics.

I'm typing this to acknowledge my appreciation for the blessings in my life.  True, work is work and should not be what defines a person, but we all have bills to pay and I'm truly happy to be with a company that appreciates me as much as I enjoy the work I do."

"event","My dearest Grandma Laswell.  The last of my grandparents has passed behind the veil.  You were my father's mother and taught him humility and respect and love for all living creatures.  This is my favorite trait of my father.  You were a seamstress for an occupation, but were also the seamstress of our family history.  You would weave between stories of ancestors long passed and share with your grandchildren where we came from.  You taught me to be proud of our Cherokee, Chicachaw and Blackfoot heritage while making sure not to interfere with the religion my parents chose for me.  You were a wise and loving mother crone who I will always remember and respect.  Every night, I will wrap myself up in the quilt you made for me and feel your love.  May our ancestors welcome you with open arms.  Please tell Grandpa I'm looking forward to meeting him.

Rest well Grandma"

"event","I was meditating the other day on the socio-economic systems and how they would fair when put under the comparisons of religions they would represent.  Let me be clear that I'm not evaluating which socio-economic system is the best, only what they would corrolate to when comparing their beliefs.


Communism - no centralized government - there is a collective ownership of property and the organization of labor for the common advantage of all members.
This, in my opinion, represents Buddism.  All are equal, all share in the blessings and curses created by one another via karma.  Karma is the driving force in doing good in the Buddist faith, while a type of social-karma is the driving force behind a communist society.  

Communism - An economic system based on ""you put in your fair share; you get your fair share"".  This is a prime example of Karma.  You get what you put out.

Socialism - the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy.  Socialism also rejects class-based society.  All citizens are equal, with equal rights and focus on quality of living.

Socialism represnts the Judeo-Christian-Islamic belief of God in control of everything while the believers or citizens have a responsibility to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves.  Jesus was a Liberal Socialist, who would've thought.

Socialism - An economic system based on ""you get a share regardless of your contribution"".  This represents the Judeo-Christian-Islamic view of helping those who cannot help themselves, regardless of what they can contribute.

Which brings me to Capitalism.  Ah, yes, the great American way.  A system where he who works or strives the hardest, makes the most money.  A system solely based on gaining for oneself and ones family, separate from the concerns or needs of others.

There is only one religion that shares these principles.  The view of ""Fuck everyone else, I'm here for me."" resides in one faith and one faith only.  Satanism (Atheistic Satanists specifically) holds the belief that this world is your oyster so you should do with it as you wish.  If you wish to steal that oyster from someone else who needs it, oh well.  If you want to take that oyster and shove it in someone's eye cause they looked at you wrong, make sure you grab two so that he can't see at all.  Satanism and Capitalism are different belief systems flying under the same flag.

Capitalism - An economic system based on ""survival of the fittest"".  No faith better epitomizes this than Satanism."

"event","I recently attended a dinner party where a relatively well-educated individual stated that the founding fathers were not only all Christian, but also fully supported that the Constitution is based solely on Christian principles and beliefs.  He also stated that the founding fathers saw this as a Christian nation, just lots of different types of Christians, but Christians nonetheless.  

Wow...

After taking some deep breaths and picking my jaw up off the floor, I proceeded to mention examples like Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, John Adams who all were quoted supporting the separation church and state and denouncing established religion as a tool of societal torture and oppression.  The first six presidents were completely without denomination.  Most were Deists.  Washington himself never mentioned God, muchless Jesus in any of his speeches.  Any reference to God are terms like ""The creator"" or ""The Divine One"", terms that can apply to any faith, not just exclusive to Christianity.  There are quotes from multiple ministers stating that George Washington never took part in any sacrements.  
Now, I don't dispise Christianity anymore than I dispise any other organized faith.  I feel they all have positive attributes with guiding those less intelligent to make positive life choices (like not robbing or killing people), while the rest of us can realize that doing bad things just makes you a douche, a cancer on the lifeline of the society of mankind.  We don't need some big bad guy in the sky pointing his finger at us.  That being said, I don't discount the existance of God anymore than I can prove the existance.  

With all that in mind, I decided that I needed to collect these quotes all in one place, so I know I'm not going crazy thinking we're a nation created on a principle (among many others) of freedom FROM religion.


Examples of how certain founding fathers were not basing our governmental system on a Christian based belief system:

Freedom for religion, but also freedom from religion
""All persons shall have full and free liberty of religious opinion; nor shall any be compelled to frequent or maintain any religious institution"" 
- Thomas Jefferson

""Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth. ""
- Thomas Jefferson

""I have recently been examining all the known superstitions of the world, and do not find in our particular superstition [Christianity] one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology.""
-Thomas Jefferson

"".our civil rights have no dependance on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry""
- Thomas Jefferson

""the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were yet pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced or that such a character existed .... What a conspiracy this, between Church and State."" 
- Thomas Jefferson

""I know it will give great offense to the clergy, but the advocate of religious freedom is to expect neither peace nor forgiveness from them.""
- Thomas Jefferson

""The bill for establishing religious freedom, the principles of which had, to a certain degree, been enacted before, I had drawn in all the latitude of reason & right. It still met with opposition; but, with some mutilations in the preamble, it was finally passed; and a singular proposition proved that it's protection of opinion was meant to be universal. Where the preamble declares, that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, an amendment was proposed by inserting ""Jesus Christ,"" so that it would read ""A departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion;"" the insertion was rejected by the great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantle of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mohametan, the Hindoo and Infidel of every denomination.""
-Thomas Jefferson

""And the day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a Virgin Mary, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.... But we may hope that the dawn of reason and freedom of thought in these United States will do away [with] all this artificial scaffolding. ""
- Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Adams

""But a short time elapsed after the death of the great reformer [Jesus] of the Jewish religion, before his principles were departed from by those who professed to be his special servants, and perverted into an engine for enslaving mankind, and aggrandizing their oppressors in Church and State. ""
- Thomas Jefferson

""I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved -- the Cross. Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!""
- John Adams

""We should begin by setting conscience free. When all men of all religions ... shall enjoy equal liberty, property, and an equal chance for honors and power ... we may expect that improvements will be made in the human character and the state of society. ""
- John Adams

""Let the human mind loose. It must be loose. It will be loose. Superstition and Dogmatism cannot confine it. ""
- John Adams, letter to John Quincy Adams

""The United States have adventured upon a great and noble experiment, which is believed to have been hazarded in the absence of all previous precedent -- that of total separation of church and state. No religious establishment by law exists among us. The conscience is left free from all restraint and each is permitted to worship his maker after his own judgement ... Such is the great experiment which we have tried; our system of free government would be imperfect without it."" 
- John Tyler

""Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprize [sic], every expanded prospect.""
- James Madison,

""And I have no doubt that every new example will succeed, as every past one has done, in shewing that religion & Govt will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together. ""
- James Madison

""As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of government to protect all conscientious protesters thereof, and I know of no other business government has to do therewith. ""
- Thomas Paine, Common Sense

""Persecution is not an original feature in any religion; but it is always the strongly-marked feature of all law-religions, or religions established by law. Take away the law-establishment, and every religion re-assumes its original benignity. ""
- Thomas Paine, The Rights of Man

""All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish [Muslim], appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit. I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe. It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that mental lying has produced in society. When a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime. He takes up the profession of a priest for the sake of gain, and in order to qualify himself for that trade he begins with a perjury. Can we conceive anything more destructive to morality than this? ""
- Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason

""Take away from Genesis the belief that Moses was the author, on which only the strange belief that it is the word of God has stood, and there remains nothing of Genesis but an anonymous book of stories, fables, and traditionary or invented absurdities, or of downright lies. ""
- Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason



Washington a Deist:
""Unlike Thomas Jefferson -- and Thomas Paine, for that matter -- Washington never even got around to recording his belief that Christ was a great ethical teacher. His reticence on the subject was truly remarkable. Washington frequently alluded to Providence in his private correspondence. But the name of Christ, in any correspondence whatsoever, does not appear anywhere in his many letters to friends and associates throughout his life.""
- Paul F Boller

""The founders of our nation were nearly all Infidels, and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected [Washington; Adams; Jefferson; Madison; Monroe; Adams; Jackson] not a one had professed a belief in Christianity....
     ""Among all our presidents from Washington downward, not one was a professor of religion, at least not of more than Unitarianism.""
- The Reverend Doctor Bird Wilson

""As President, Washington regularly attended Christian services, and he was friendly in his attitude toward Christian values. However, he repeatedly declined the church's sacraments. Never did he take communion, and when his wife, Martha, did, he waited for her outside the sanctuary.... Even on his deathbed, Washington asked for no ritual, uttered no prayer to Christ, and expressed no wish to be attended by His representative. George Washington's practice of Christianity was limited and superficial because he was not himself a Christian. In the enlightened tradition of his day, he was a devout Deist--just as many of the clergymen who knew him suspected. ""
- Barry Schwartz, George Washington: The Making of an American Symbol

""One of the embarrassing problems for the early nineteenth-century champions of the Christian faith was that not one of the first six Presidents of the United States was an orthodox Christian. ""
- Mortimer Adler, 1902- , American philosopher and educator

The following founding fathers and their beliefs
George Washington, Deist
Thomas Jefferson, Deist
John Adams, Deist
Thomas Paine, Atheist"

"event","In her radio show, Dr Laura Schlesinger said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any circumstance.

The following response is an open letter to Dr. Laura, written by a US  
man,and posted on the Internet. It's funny, as well as informative:

Dear Dr. Laura:

Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination ... End of debate.

I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of God's Laws and how to follow them.

1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?

2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?

3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of Menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15: 19-24. The problem is how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.

4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?

5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?

6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination, Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there 'degrees' of abomination?

7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room here?

8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?

9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?

10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev.19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair, like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)

I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so I'm confident you can help.
Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.

Your adoring fan.

James M. Kauffman, Ed.D. Professor Emeritus,
Dept. Of Curriculum, Instruction, and Special Education
University of Virginia 

PS (It would be a damn shame if we couldn't own a Canadian)"

"event","SAYING GOODBYE TO MOTHER 

We were dressed and ready to go out for the New Years Eve Party.  We turned on a night light, turned the answering machine on, covered our pet parakeet and put the cat in the backyard.

We phoned the local cab company and requested a taxi.  The taxi arrived and we opened the front door to leave the house.

As we walked out the door, the cat we had put out in the yard, scoots back into the house.  We didn't want the cat shut in the house because she always tries to eat the bird.

My wife goes on out to the taxi, while I went back inside to get the cat. The cat runs upstairs, with me in hot pursuit.  

Waiting in the cab, my wife doesn't want the driver to know that the house will be empty for the night so she explains to the taxi driver that I will be out soon, 'He's just going upstairs to say Goodbye to my mother.' 

A few minutes later, I get into the cab.  'Sorry I took so long,' I said, as we drove away.
'That stupid bitch was hiding under the bed.  I had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out!  She tried to take off, so I grabbed her by the neck.  Then, I had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from scratching me.  But it worked!  I hauled her fat ass downstairs and threw her into the back yard!' 

 

The cab driver hit a parked car."

"event","Recently there have been a lot of reality shows that have focused their attention on Jersey in one form or another.  ""The Jersey Shore"", ""Jerseylicious"", ""The real housewives of Jersey"", ""Cake Boss"", ""My big friggen wedding"", the list goes on and on... 

Now I'm born and raised in New Jersey.  I LOVE my state.  In my opinion, we have more to offer than any other state in the union.  Mountains with excellent skiing, beaches that are great for surfing, beautiful farmland, PORKROLL AND CHEESE, awesome music scene, great vineyards, Atlantic City, proximity to Philadelphia, NYC, DC, etc.  With all these great features of our state, it frustrates me to see so much false-Jersey representation on T.V. 

First off, let's focus on the accent.  I don't talk like an extra from The Sapranos.  Nor do any of my friends or anyone I would associate myself with.  Second, anyone who does talk like that is from Staten Island, Long Island or some other New York City borough.  There is a portion of north Jersey that has been infected with these annoying D-bags and their butchery of the english language, but most normal New Jerseyans consider the top portion of our state to be more Southern New York than Northern New Jersey.  My bass player actually lives in this area of New Jersey and doesn't have the accent.  Neither do any of his friends from that area.

Second, the personality.  The women on these shows are trash.  Absolute trash.  Not that the guys are any kind of prize, but the portrayal of Jersey women is vile.  Jersey women are proud sweet and strong, but not loud-mouth trash-spewing untrustworthy bitches.  And the guys...  If you see any guy in a Jersey club fist-pumping, they are bennies (tourists) or they are real Jersey guys making fun of the gelled-out pumpkin-tanned douchebags that think it's cool to wear shades in a pitch black club.  This isn't 1984, you're not Cory Hart, so wearing your sunglasses at night does not make you cool.  

Finally, I'd like to point out that all but one person from ""The Jersey Shore"" are NOT from New Jersey.  Also, we don't call it ""The Shore"", we just call it the beach.  If you say you're going to the shore, the locals know you're just another d-bag coming through to use our town like a toilet.

I grew up 10 minutes from where the first Jersey Shore was filmed.  The reason there were so many more fights on that show was that the locals hate guido scum.  As a local, you end up only going to certain areas like Sleaze-side from late summer through early spring.  During the summer, you just find a local beach that the bastids haven't infected.  I'm so glad I live more west now and don't have to deal with them anymore!!"

"event","""A Melbourne man is about to spend just over three weeks in a shop window living with 400 spiders, to raise money for charity.""

http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/15/3066281.htm


""He originally put 400 spiders into the window, but there are not that many left.

""Spiders don't like each other too much and there's been a bit of a massacre, so there's a few less,"" he said.

""Some big huntsmen are saying wow here's lunch coming along."" 

I LOVE spiders.  But this guy is a bit over the top.  Redbacks are cousins of the Black Widow with an equally dangerous bite.  Huntsmen spiders are similar to Tarantulas in that they are big, slowish, but eat a lot.  While Blackhouse spiders aren't that dangerous, they do have a painful bite and are more likely to flight than fight.

Also, ""drier-than-normal conditions are forecast to occur over the Southwest and the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes"".  Which means the Bears will have some decent weather for the second half of their season.

I'm honestly hoping, nay, praying for snow this year.  It will be our first winter in our new house and I'd love to wake up to an obscene amount of snow outside our door.

Awesome band name, now I just need to come up with a new band or project to attach to it.


Yesterday Rich helped me move my kegorator from the garage to the basement.  As I was going to bed last night, I was walking up the stairs looking at how proud & pretty she looked standing there just humming away next to our well-stocked bar.  2 minifridges, 1 wine fridge, and a full-sized kegorator = an electric bill from hell.  Now I just have to finish off the old beer that's left in the keg.  Looks like daddy's getting drunk this weekend!

Wine rack (Jenn is making a nice one)

"event","Hmm... One of the most simplistic, easy to follow commandments.  Yet, is it?  Being that it's so simplistic, there is no real detail as to who should or should not be killed.  It doesn't say ""Thou shall not kill Jews, Christians or anyone in Plumbers Local 103"".  So, to be a true Judeo-Christian, one should abstain from killing any and all beings.  Not just humans, but plants and animals as well.  One could say ""well, it was just assumed to pertain to other humans"", but I don't play that game.  So, in order to be a proper Bible following Jew or Christian, one must be a vegetarian, but does not have to be a vegan.  For example, taking milk from a cow does not kill the cow, so it gets the stamp of approval.  Same with eggs.  Fruits like apples, oranges, lemons, etc. are fair game because when plucked, the plant/tree does not die.  Onions, wheat, lettuce, etc. are not to be eaten for it involves killing said plants. 

If one wanted to get even deeper into the lives of cells, it would be arguable that no one should eat anything as it would kill the cells of whatever was eaten.  But they didn't know about cells when they were writing that violent but interesting story called the Bible...


Now if you'd all turn to the book of Revelations, Psalm 69..."

Dinosaur Jr. - Not The Same

On this day where you're so messed it's clear 
Can't explain the road you roam
Anyone who's been 
As I walk with you, It chills me so 
To hear you say it's come to this
And that it's okay

In a dream I always talk to you 
You seem fine again, my sweet 
Feels alright to me 
Is it right for you? 
Flippin' out I try to call to you 
Do you call to me?
Tell me what to do 

And I know it's not the same, there's no blame -Still I bother you- 
And you say it's not your deal, it's mine to feel -Follow along with you- 

Come alive I know you'll sing to me 
I won't sing to you 
It's not a thing I do 
Has it been a different feel for you? 
The whole time this was going on 
Or is it something new? 
And I know it's not the same, there's no blame -Still I'm bothering you- 
And you say it's not your deal, it's mine to feel -You won't pull me through- 
Any way you're not the same, it's the blame -Follow along with you- 

It's a lingering that comes through me 
Does it come to you? 
Are we really through? 
Any guy would do this thing for me 
It's not much to ask 
Why can't you? 
I'm not gonna say I've had my way 
You sure saw to that 
But what else can I do? 
You promised so much that I would never touch
I believed in you
For the last time"

I, of course, am in there every other night for other bands, but I'm glad to have my band back in my studio jamming out.  Tonight is going to just be a WD-40 night.  Oil the squeaky parts, loosen up and get rid of the rust!  We have about 10 songs on the chopping block, but these three are on our ""TO DO"" list.  Overall, it'll just be a jam session though.  We need to just relax and have fun.

"event","1st step in making the big move!  We got pre-approved today for a mortgage that is exactly what we were looking for.  Going house-shopping this weekend with my (soon to be) sister-in-law who is a manager of a real estate office.  There are a few houses I've had my eye on for some time now.  Good thing the market is the way it is as I can finally jump in!

Woot!! Woot!!"

"event","Had some weird dreams last night, but won't go into all the details.  It just amazes me how 1 dream can make me think of someone all day long.  Not like it was even that profound of a dream, just chatting with someone for a few minutes.  And while this person meant (and means) a lot to me, I didn't realize how much I missed this person until I woke up.  Uggh... 

Anyway, Jenn and I are picking up our house-hunt this weekend.  We put things on hold during the holidays as there is never enough time to do anything in December.  So, now we're all holiday'd-out and ready to get back to the hunt!  We've found about 20 in the area that are in our price range, have what we're looking for and have decent taxes (in Jersey, that's anything lower than $6,000/year).  Jenn is hooked on HGTV as she's already got about 10 projects lined up for me even though we don't have the house picked out yet!  :)  Plus, this weekend we have to find a car for Jenn.  Well, we don't HAVE to, but I know she's dying for her own transportation.  Working in Manhattan and living in S.I. meant she never needed a car.  In Jersey, we don't have the public transportation that NYC does, though.

Big expenses, busy weekend!!!

Penny Mole (my band) is looking to start recording a bar demo at the end of the month.  3 song demo should only take about 10-15 hours to record and master.  10-15 hours for $500 aint a bad price, either.  Especially with the engineer who is doing our mastering!  He's won about 10 Grammy's, been nominated for 3 Emmy's (won once) and has worked with Bon Jovi, Destiny's Child, Willie Nelson, Rush, Pearl Jam, Ozzfest, Eric Clapton and many many more.  We're all stoked!!"

""Aint No Rest For The Wicked"" is a punchy, groovy 1st track released.  My personal favorite is ""In One Ear"" with it's slap in the face of critics lyrics and take no shit attitude.

<lj-cut text=""Penny Mole's June 6th show at High Velocity""> 

In other news, our June 6th show went great.  We tried out some new songs (""Bulls on Parade"" and ""Sugar We're Going Down"") and got a great reaction to them.  Nothing like having guys from Monster Magnet, Cycle of Pain, and Black Label Society in your audience to give you motivation.  The best part was that we got an open invite to play there whenever we want.  I've played High Velocity a few times with two other bands and never got that kind of response from the owner.  We have 5 shows coming up between now and November and possibly another on August 1st in Connecticut for a Cancer Benefit, but we're waiting on details for that one.

This Saturday, my band (Penny Mole) are opening for Jonny Pipes and Cycle of Pain at High Velocity in Beachwood, NJ.  Cycle of Pain is a band with John ""JD"" DeServio from Black Label Society.  Black Label Society is a group that Zakk Wylde (Jersey native) started after he played lead guitar for Ozzy.  3 degrees of separation to the Prince of Darkness brings an evil smile to my face!

John ""JD"" DeServio will be awarding the Zakk Wylde autographed guitar shown below to benefit the MaLissa Eisenhaur Benefit.

"event","So I turned the big 30 this past weekend.  Jenn gave me the best present I've ever gotten.  She took me to Paggio's (a great italian restaurant) in NYC.  After a delicious meal of braised rabbit, she took me to The Canal Room to see Greg Laswell perform. She completely surprised me and we even got front row seats!  Rosi Golan opened and even though I've never heard her, she won Jenn and I over.  After the show I got to talk with Greg and got his autograph and a picture with him.  Even though he plays some melancholy stuff, he's actually an upbeat guy and a great entertainer.

I have the best girl in the world!  :)

<lj-cut text=""Kings of Leon - Revelry (one of my favorites)"">
What a night for a dance
You know I'm a dancing machine
With the fire in my bones
And the sweet taste of kerosene
I get lost in the night
So high don't wanna come down
To face the loss
Of the good thing that I have found

Woo hoo hoooo
Woo hoo hoooo

In the dark of the night
I can hear you callin' my name
With the hardest of hearts
I still feel full of pain
So I drink and I smoke
And I ask If you're ever around
Even though it was me 
Who drove us right in the ground

See the time we shared
It was precious to me
But all the while
I was dreamin' of revelry

Gonna run baby run
Like a stream down a mountainside
With the wind in my back
I wont ever even bat an eye
Just know it was you all along
That had a hold of my heart
But the demon and me
Were the best of friends from the start

So the time we shared it
Was precious to me
All the while
I was dreamin' of revelry

Dreamin' of revelry

And I told myself, 
Oh the way you go 
It rained so hard, 
It felt like snow
Everything came tumbling down on me
In the back of the woods, 
It was dark as night
Palest pale,
Of the old moonlight
Everything just felt so incomplete

Dreamin' of revelry
Dreamin' of revelry
Dreamin' of revelry
Dreamin' of revelry

I've been drinking this for about a year now and it's awesome!  I'm tired of going to 711 or Wa-Wa (any state that doesn't have Wa-Wa, isn't worth living in) and my only choices are water or high-fructose-corn-syrup laden drinks.

For those of you who like to consume healthy products (and you know who I'm talking to) I cannot recommend this tea enough!

Inko's is pure, using filtered water in the brewing process.  It has a very light sweetness (not sugary and syrupy) which is acheived through fructose crystals, not HFCS. 

Yeah, it fuckin rocks."

"event","5th ANNUAL CONCERT FOR STEVE!!

<img src=""http://www.angelfire.com/music6/stevepics/untitled.bmp"">

Every year we get together a group of friends, family and musicians to pay tribute to Steve McNabb.  A drummer of immense talent, he passed on when he was only 26 and we have been honoring him ever since.  
Our mission is to raise money for a variety of worthy musically-based causes.  Focusing on the grassroots level, we do everything from purchasing new instruments for schools that don't have the budget to do so themselves to providing scholarships to young musicians heading off to college.  

OFFICIAL DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR OCTOBER 18th!!

Bands playing:

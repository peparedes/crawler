"event","This stuff still amuses me, probably because New York drives me crazy. And also because people where I grew up tended to have multiple terms for the same item...

Age: 24

Where did you grow up: Grand Rapids, Michigan

WHAT DO YOU CALL:

1. A body of water, smaller than a river, contained within relatively narrow banks.
Creek! *My mom says ""Crick"" which I always used to tell her ""only a hick says crick""

2. What the thing you push around the grocery store is called.
Grocery cart

3. A metal container to carry a meal in.
Lunchbox? I always thought they were plastic, though.

4. The thing that you cook bacon and eggs in.
Frying pan. Or even just ""pan""

5. The piece of furniture that seats three people.
Couch

6. The device on the outside of the house that carries rain off the roof.
Gutters

7. The covered area outside a house where people sit in the evening.
Porch/deck (depending if it's on the ground or elevated)

8. Carbonated, sweetened, non-alcoholic beverages.
Pop, bitches!

9. A flat, round breakfast food served with syrup.
Pancake.

10. A long sandwich designed to be a whole meal in itself.
Sub. or maybe ""hoagie"" every once in a while.

11. The piece of clothing worn by men at the beach.
Trunks? Speedo? Body hair? I guess that only counts as clothing for a few guys heh.

12. Shoes worn for sports.
Tennis shoes. Or sneakers. Depending on what they look like. If they have high tops, they can't be tennis shoes.

13. Putting a room in order.
Straightening up/cleaning room.

14. A flying insect that glows in the dark.
Firefly? Is there another word for it?

15. The little insect that curls up into a ball.
??? I don't think we have any of them where I'm from. If we do, I'm glad I never noticed them.

16.The children's playground equipment where one kid sits on one side and goes up while the other sits on the other side and goes down.
Seesaw

17. How do you eat your pizza?
With my hands, not folded. Unless I'm eating with Liz, when there is a chance I will cut it with a knife and fork just to piss her off.

18. What's it called when private citizens put up signs and sell their used stuff?
Garage sale if it's in a garage, yard sale if it's in a yard. Wow, how logical!

19. What's the evening meal?
Dinnah, though a LOT of people where I grew up said supper. 

20. The thing under a house where the furnace and perhaps a rec room are?
Basement. Good to have, in case of tornado.

21. What do you call the thing that you can get water out of to drink in public places?
Water fountain or drinking fountain"

"event","you know, everybody hates the republicans and the democrats right now. and nobody really seems to think any of the candidates for president are that great either. so why isn't somebody trying to pull a big run as an independent or third party? they probably wouldn't win, but if any year is the year it's now. i was just reading about ron paul and thinking, this guy is diametrically opposed to the rest of his party on 75% of the issues. why the fuck is he running as a republican? as a republican, he's buried in the rest of the pack. if he had financial backing to pull it off, i bet he could run. and people would notice him and a lot of them would like what he has to say. but noooo...nobody's a big independent candidate right now. i don't get it.

oh wait, politicians are dumb. that would explain a lot.

also, i'm horribly ill with a cold of d00m. wtf? it's fucking september, i'm not supposed to get this shit till november at least."

"event","Into the four houses of Hogwarts.  By Matt and I on a 100% sleepless night.  Feel free to add/object/complain/whatever.  Of course, everyone nyah is smart enough to get into Ravenclaw, but just being smart doesn't necessarily mean you're a Ravenclaw.

Me: Ravenclaw. 100%, no doubt.

Matt: Ravenclaw, also with no margin of error.

Robin: Ravenclaw.  She's close to Gryffindor, but in the end the scales tip toward Ravenclaw.  Matt adds that she used to be Gryffindow, but once she joined our motley crew of stoners, she became a Ravenclaw (personally I feel that she was always a Ravenclaw.)

Colleen: Strong Gryffindor! Yay we love Colleen.  She exemplifies everything that's good about Gryffindor.

Lori: Hufflepuff.  Lori's strong loyal streak moves her away from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor into Hufflepuff.

Liz: The first Slytherin!  Liz, we love you.  But you're still a Slytherin.  You are just a wee bit aloof when it comes to other people, and that moves you from Gryffindor to Slytherin...I really think the two are quite similar.

Shua: Gryffindor! Shua is very Hufflepuff-y, but in the end his willingness to put himself on the line for his friends makes him a Gryffindor.

Ilda: Hufflepuff. Ilda is incredibly hard-working and loyal.

Megan: Slytherin. Megan's excellent streak of cynicism puts her into Slytherin.

Deb: Hufflepuff.  Deb is incredibly loyal :)

Bob: Ravenclaw.  His amazing ability to be lazy, yet hardworking makes him a perfect Ravenclaw.

Seth: Gryffindor! 100%, no margin of error.

Helen: Ravenclaw. Smart, yet lazy.

Beat: Hufflepuff. Beat's hardworkingness and her loyalty put her in Hufflepuff.

Reid: Hufflepuff. Yet another loyal hardworker. You guys make awesome friends.

Jim: Ravenclaw...we don't know how to explain this one, but it seems right.

Paul: Slytherin.  Delightfully sketchy.

Susan: Slytherin, for the same reason as Paul.

Betsy: Gryffindor. She cares about everyone.

Jenn: Ravenclaw. Sharpness defines the Ravenclaw.

Alex: Gryffindor. He seems like a Slytherin offhand, but in the end he wound up in Gryffindor.

Ari: Gryffindor. Our beloved Floridian RA is a clear Gryffindor.

Rick: Gryffindor. Jesus you people make really great friends.

Jeff: (From Greenwich) Slytherin.  Matt says it, so I shall believe it.

Fletcher: (From Greenwich) Hufflepuff 100%."

"event","that pretty much sums up my summer. basically, this job makes me want to hurt myself, the fact that it's run by crooks from the government means they don't pay me when they say they will, and despite being beautiful, wyoming still sucks serious balls.  i want my california goodness.

tonight, after i found out i wasn't going to be paid for work i was told i would be paid for, i got in my car and started driving. i didn't even have shoes on, but it felt good to have the car under my total control, feeling every little twitch of the pedals -- at least i can control that.  i went up this road that seemed to lead into the mountains.  behind me the sun went down and turned the sky cotton candy tie dyed.  the pink purple blue gray light reflected off the red rocks and turned them violet.  tiny ramshackle houses and huge mansions surrounded by trees sat under the cliffs, practically begging fire or landslide to devour them.  i wanted to be devoured by a grizzly, myself, but i couldn't find one.  i kept driving.  eventually i came to a fork in the road. i went left, and much to my shock, i found myself back where i started.

i don't know what this means, or if it means anything. but i do  know i want to get out of here before i go crazy.  wait, i'm already crazy. shit."

"event","Kinda. I am on a library computer right now, as the student apartments don't have internet, although they do have cable.  Wait, maybe I should start from the beginning.

So after arriving at Robin's house (trip may be detailed at another time if I have time) we spent the day there.  I missed my puppy and kitten already.  Then at night we took a long-ass drive to JFK (kudos to Robin & family for be willing to drive me out there) where I caught a delayed, then delayed, then delayed some more flight into Salt Lake City on Jet Blue.  Which would have been nice had it not been so delayed.  I got in around 3am (was supposed to get in at midnight), waited for the shuttle to the economy lot, and went to my hotel and slept.  Until 9, because I had to get up and drive to Boise.  Which I did, only to discover my directions were wrong.  Finally I found the road north to the camp where we were staying, which was in an utterly podunk town called Donnelly.  It was very pretty though -- a 4H camp (yes I thought of you Colleen) right on a big resevoir called Cascade Lake.  No heat in the cabins, which was unfortunate as the temps averaged about 40 while we were there.  Which pretty much meant everyone was miserable, because it's not like you bring your ski clothes when you're going to a camp at the end of May.  There was snow in the mountains surrounding the camp and one night, it snowed. Yes that's right. White shit fell all over the ground.  I missed two days of training, although I apparently did not miss much as the training was fairly repetitive.  

Then on Sunday we left and drove to Jackson, Wyoming which was quite nice.  Very pretty, and still snow-covered.  I longed for my skis.  Then on Monday we drove through the Grand Tetons Park (or the Grand Titties Park as I called it) where there was still more snow.  Needless to say, I stayed in the car.  Then we finally arrived in Riverton, Wyoming, where we are staying in student apartments at the community college (go figure) which have no internet, and the phone service costs extra.  But hey, cable is free.  I am in the library at the school right now, which is only possible because I have the afternoon off.  The library closes at 5.  But in a week and a half we are supposedly moving into a house with high-speed internet access.  Which should be sweet.  Then I will always be online...always.

There isn't really much to do here, even though it's gorgeous.  Yesterday we went to Sinks State Park.  The Sinks is where the Popo Agie River(however you're pronouncing that, you're wrong) mysteriously sinks into limestone caverns, then emerges a quarter mile downstream....three hours later.  Very odd, and nobody can get into the caves to see where the water goes.  It's pretty treacherous.  I've also seen bison (the correct term I'm informed), antelopes, mule deer, white-tailed deer, wild turkeys (a BIG one ran in front of my car) and a marmot.  Oh, and also a butterfly called a ""Mourning Cloak.""  There are bears and mountains lions around nyah too, but I have been fortunate in not actually seeing any of them.  You can see the mountains all around us.  They still have snow, which my boss Robin Whiteplume informs me is a good thing, but he also said there's usually snow till the end of June in a good year, which isn't gonna happen.  So lots of fires, he says.  They have a 100% repression policy here, which isn't good, but kind of makes sense since the settlements are so scattered.  So if I wind up fighting a fire (in my case, actually, driving supply lines) I make $20 an hour.  If I don't, I make $60 a week.  This, needless to say, is a dilemma.

My coworkers are Kate Eiriksson (team leader), Rachel Fonzi (don't call her the Fonz), and Will Draper.  Kate is from  Boise.  She's nice, and also quite chipper.  Rachel is from California, San Luis Obispo to be exact, and she's my age.  Will is from North Carolina and damn is he a southerner.  Luckily I have managed to rid myself of his accent, which I picked up when I first got to Idaho.  I figure I'll just talk like the people around nyah.  They are very, very, very laid back.  Well, I guess there's no real reason to stress in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming.

Anyways...my 21st is two weeks from today...sweeeeet."

so it was hotter than hell again today, which is why i didn't leave my room except for meals.  i'm not wearing very much, but i'm still all overheated.  it's just damn hot in here.  i also need to clean up my room sooooo bad but with my recent combination of extreme laziness and extreme loads of work, it hasn't happened. my room is an utter pigsty, and last night i discovered the source of the fruit flies that had been plaguing me was an open beer bottle matt left here like a month ago, that promptly got covered by books. then when i removed said books...fruit flies everywhere. aaaaagh. it was terrible. but now the beer bottle is in the trash can outside, as are most of the fruit flies. yak.  let me tell you, i am not looking forward to packing up.  although an evil little part of me wants to start it now, and when the rest of my brain says ""why? what the fuck"" that part of me doesn't have an answer.

so yeah, as i am yet again unemployed, robin and i will be driving the ass-load of miles to my house, then a subsequent ass-load of miles to her house.  why oh why must people live on the east coast? it's cold AND far away.  michigan is cold and far away, but nobody actually WANTS to live there. as far as i can tell.

dammit, i need to get back to work."

right now the music is perfect, the temperature is perfect.  i am happy.  my feet are dirty, i am sweaty, but i feel good.  i have forgotten all the things due, the summer, next year, everything after that.  now if only i could stay like this forever..."

"event","so yes, i appear to be updating again. i am not sure what this means, as i am not in any way less busy than usual.  maybe it's because i'm more pissed off than usual? or maybe i need to up my meds, haha.  

well i've finished all my work for tomorrow (said work being about 400 pages of reading, one 6.5 page paper, one 4 page paper, and a long webct post. gack.) i still need to get my two big paper ideas in order -- they're both supposed to be 15 to 20 pages and they're both in my anthro classes. i also need to catch up on the stats i missed, and finish the first chapter of that story i'm going to submit to david foster wallace to try to get into his class. although, the story is not going as well as i would like.  i know what i want to do with it, but i'm having a lot of problems with technical stuff -- like narration.  it takes place 100 years ago and i'm not sure how i want to approach that. so basically, i have this great story rolling around in my head, and i just don't know how to put it to paper.  actually, that's been a problem for me my whole life. i've always written, but i've never really been satisfied with my own writing. it's always missing a certain element of something that's present when i imagine the stories.  but it might just be me. i can't tell. how can you tell anything about your own creative writing, really? maybe it's like singing. matt claims that everyone hates the recorded sound of their own voice.  maybe i just can't stand the sound of my own stories.

i have just realized that it's been almost two months since i pierced my nose, an occasion that can be marked by the amount of time the valentine's day balloons i got from tutti mangia have been attached to the strange little pipes that run down the wall behind my desk.  they haven't deflated at all, which is kind of bizarre.  i guess they were just tied really, really well.  wait, i take that back -- the white one has definitely deflated a bit.  but all the others seem to have their full size.  hmmm.

goddamn my room is a pigsty. between my messy tendencies, being hella busy lately and matt knocking half a bag of granola onto my rug, my room has become disgusting.  perhaps i shall clean it on tuesday.  we all know i won't do anything to it tomorrow, because i'll be in class from the time i wake up till pretty much the time i go to sleep.

i also have some decisions to make.  firstly, am i going to write a thesis? if so, what on?  this decision will undoubtedly be helped by finding out a. when the research class at pitzer (the class i can take instead of a thesis) is and also if i get funding to do research this summer, which leads me to decision two: what the FUCK am i going to do this summer? i applied for so many jobs and i have yet to hear for sure about any of them, although i got an interview on one.  i just want to know what i'm going to be doing this summer! i'm not anal retentive, i just want to know something for sure for once in my life!  also room draw numbers supposedly come out tomorrow. who knows what kind of number i'll get or where i'll wind up living next semester. gaaaaaahhhhhh.

oh yeah, the title of this entry was about halona, haha.  i went there for the first time last weekend, and while it was fun, i was much disappointed by the lack of loft-jumping.  the cabin is kind of bizarre, with basically one giant open room and a kitchen on the first floor, and a giant open loft with two private bedrooms on the upstairs.  very odd, but i re-remembered my love for idyllwild. it's so cute. i could totally live there.

it was also the econ retreat, which meant there was a lot of talk about econ.  well, not really, more about econ profs, most of whom i've heard plenty about.  but you know, i really realized on that trip that i need to find out what the hell is going on in my own department.  i mean, i have a right to know! it's my major! c'mon people. lynn rapaport our department head? something's gone horribly wrong in anthropology land..."

96 hours exactly until my flight leaves. that is vastly too many hours.

so what's been up here...the aforementioned family issues.  my dog seems sick, we're taking him to the vet tomorrow.  my grandfather died, and i'm still not sure how i'm dealing with that. maybe it strikes me that i should feel more, or worse.  or maybe having experienced my father dying, i feel less with this, which is kind of scary. on the other hand, i was never close to him. i kissed him and told him goodbye a day before he died, and when i looked into his eyes i knew he knew he was dying, and that he didn't want to.  and i can't imagine being in so much pain and so incapable of caring for myself...and knowing it.  god, maybe i'll just blow my own head off when the time comes.

so yes, i am back in the Land of Neverending Cold, which everyone keeps telling me is actually ""quite warm for this time of year."" uh huh. yeah, forty feels fuckin toasty.  oh wait, no it doesn't.  although the amusing thing is that the weather people keep predicting snow, and it never comes, except for christmas eve, which wasn't exactly a surprise because we always have a white christmas.

i have also rediscovered why, as a child, i always slept in the fetal position. it's not because the fetal position is particularly comfortable; it's not. it's because it's so fucking cold! the only way to keep warm at night, even with four blankets over you, is to curl yourself into a ball as tight as you can.

my mom is going out with her fellow widows tonight, and the animals are going nuts, max in particular. they've also been going nuts over one of the walls.  we think there's a mouse in there or something.  and anyway, my mom is dressed in nice jeans and a nice coat, only she's wearing this old lady shirt, and she's like, ""do i look like i'm fifty trying to look thirty-five?"" and a. she looks thirty five anyway. and b. old lady shirts are not conducive to the looking young. so i tried to get her to change her shirt, but she wouldn't. sigh.

so basically, i have three weeks left here, and i am going out of my skull already. there is NOTHING to do, nobody to talk to, etc etc. i talk to people online and that's about the extent of what i do every day. oh, i suppose sometimes i cook food. or play with my dog. but yeah, that's getting old. i'm ready to go back to school.

for some reason i'm really craving cheesy eggs. but that's okay, because in a week i shall have my cheesy eggs. and no more dining hall food for a month, although i'll probably get fat when i don't have healthy dining hall stuff all the time. dammit. although god knows i've eaten enough crap lately, what with death by chocolate and aruffo's last night.

so i've also been visiting the cdo lately, and the career counselor made me feel a lot better about my future endeavours.  she assured me that since i am so open to such a wide range of careers, that i am likely to find some sort of employment when i graduate.  which makes me feel better. i really don't want to live at home after i graduate. i want to live in a nice little house or an apartment, and have a kitten and a puppy and play with them all the time. yeah, that's pretty much my current dream.  i did tell her that i'd like to travel as part of my job, which is the truth. i like travelling, as long as i get to come home to my bed after a few weeks.  or if i get to take my bed with me, that's fine.

OH!!! i almost forgot the Story of the Cell Phone and the Storm Drain.  so last week robin and i went out holiday-shopping and i had my cell phone with me. i put it in my coat pocket, thinking it would be safer there than in the pocket of the miniskirt i was wearing.  then i got out of the car and jumped over the storm drain to the sidewalk and robin and i started to walk back to our room.  we were almost back and i realized i didn't have my cell phone. wasn't in my coat pockets, wasn't in my skirt, wasn't in any of my shopping bags. what the fuck? so i went back to her car and looked up and down for it, but i couldn't find it. it was really dark, for one thing.  so i borrowed dylan's cell phone and called my phone, expecting it to ring to let me know where it was.  and it DID, only it was ringing from the motherfucking storm drain!!!!  so i called robin and told her to come bring a flashlight, that my motherfucking phone had gone down the storm drain.  she brought a flashlight and i whimpered when i saw my phone down the storm drain like 4 feet below ground.  it looked fine, and the storm drain was dry, but i knew it wouldn't stay that way for long.  as soon as they turned the sprinklers on, that would be one dead storm drain.  so i'm just sitting here, in a miniskirt, ass to the world, thinking ""fuck."" so we went back to our room and dylan asked what was up with my phone.  i told him it was down the storm drain and i was screwed. i called maintenance but being as it was like 5:45 they were of course gone.  so dylan suggested we try to get it out and i was like well okay.  he grabbed my swiffer and asked if it was further down than that and i was like no, not really, so we tried to find some strong tape to attach to the swiffer to make a temporary grabber-thing, but of course, we didn't have any. fortunately, bob had some electrical tape.  so dylan stuck the modified swiffer down the drain and after a few tries, out came my poor cell phone, a little the worse for the wear but still working.  and that was the adventure of my cell phone, which hopefully will have no more adventures. ever.

wow, that was long. this is good procrastination."

"event","well, okay, they weren't on fire, just a little...singed. and the non-singed ones were quite yummy, thanks to megan's massively awesome cooking skills.  much sustenance was had by all involved, and then all involved went to sleep (i'm not kidding.) my new theory is that everyone at pomona is secretly a hibernating animal, and that's why we're all so weird.

speaking of hibernation, i want a nap.  i slept ten hours last night, you'd think that would be enough, but you would apparently be wrong, as my body is desirous of even more sleep.

so apparently, my sister wants serving dishes for christmas? only i don't know what those are, because i do not have the mad house-stuff buying skills. although soon, i will have to gain said skills, because i will be needing basic things like, say, a bed. yeah.

oooh but maybe that's another excuse to go to costplus...i haven't been there in sooo long. not since last year. it's very sad.  although they have apparently built one at home! wheee!

i had the weirdest dream ever last night. i already described it to robin, so i'll spare y'all needing to hear it, but it keeps playing in my head and i can't get rid of it, and it's freaking me out because it was not a nice dream. not scary, but not nice.

and now Doom Week, Part One, is starting. but i think it's Doom Week for just about everyone, not just me, because everyone's teachers are evil like that.  thanksgiving break = opportunity for teachers to give more work. yeah, pretty much. goddammit.

Monday: Oral presentation in Spanish. Essay in Spanish. Talk to advisor.
Tuesday: Scheduling. Workbook chapter in Spanish. 8 page book report in Description & Inference.
Wednesday: Prepping for the big POSA show.
Thursday: the big POSA show.

yeah, it's gonna be, uh, exciting. yeah.

you know, it's 6:30 and i should be hungry, but i'm not, cuz my tummy is filled with caramel apple cider. betcha i can live off those."

"event","i've been told i never update anymore. well, since livejournal started eating all my fucking entries, i really haven't felt like it.  that's livejournal for ya.

so it's almost thanksgiving, which is a relief in one way, and terrifying in another. in a year and a half, i'll be graduating. in six months, half my friends will be graduating.  i don't want them to go and i don't want to go. i've been assured this will change with the advent of THE THESIS, but you know, what's michigan got on a thesis?

not that i'll necessarily go back to michigan; i just have this terrifying vision of myself unable to get so much as a job at barnes & noble and having to move in with mum.  i've been unemployed for so long now it's ridiculous. fuck you bush, fuck you very much.

i do miss my critters though. they are cute and cuddly and i want to pet them. in case you can't tell by the fact that i talk about them all the frickin' time, and have like four pictures of them on my walls. no, wait, three. haha, i'm not quite that lame. 

my research is really not coming along, and it's not because i'm having trouble with it, it's because i am too lazy. seriously, i just can't seem to get myself motivated these last few weeks. it's strange because i was very motivated earlier this year.  maybe it's the damned celexa.  so much for it curing my insomnia, the insomnia has returned with a vengeance and i spend my nights sipping snapple and playing text-twist because i can't sleep. and also because i'm a giant loser.

so let's see, what do i have left to do in these last few weeks of class? what is it, uh, like three weeks? let's see, wthf, mtw, mtwthf, mtw. so that's 14 days. holy crap, dude. i better get my ass to working.  i've got another oral presentation in spanish, which i volunteered to do on the first day (silly me, but i've got scheduling the other day), another spanish essay, another spanish test, god knows how many spanish workbook chapters, my monograph, my fieldwork writeup...and then my finals. oh joy.

i've picked out what classes i really want for next semester, and the cool thing is, with the exception of stats, they sound cool.  Women in Islam, which is supposed to be an amazing class; Poli stats, which is supposed to be easy (exxxxxcellent); Language, Culture and Society at Pitzer; Kinship & Social Organization at Pitzer (how much do I love Pitzer?); and intermediate pilates, of course. can't live without my weekly dose of pain.  

life has been relatively uneventful this semester...probably a good thing. i can still fit into my size 5 skirt, which is bordering on miraculous. i'm wearing it right now, as a matter of fact.

what else...oh! i got a new coat to replace poor Corduroy Coat, who was on his last legs. once a coat's got a big hole in it, it's not very warm anymore. which is sad, although it lasted for ten years...they don't make shit like they used to, i'm telling you."

"event","which hurts despite the fact that i did nothing naughty this evening, not even one little beer.  i'm thinking it's the evil disease liz gave me. it wanted me to take it easy today, and instead i ran amok all day, work then laundry then class then IHOP then michael moore.  who i found amusing, but i was very glad i didn't pay a lot of money to see.  especially because he was like an hour late.  seriously, who the hell gets on the 10 at rush hour when they actually have something to DO at the other end? pfff. admittedly michael is from flint where traffic jams are unheard of, because nobody lives there, because flint sucks ass.  no me gusta flint. 

so what else have i been up to since my last update...which it strikes me was quite awhile ago.  hmmm...not much, really. i discovered my abdominal muscles have been made quite strong by the pilates goodness, and also that the muscles on the back of my legs are starting to show some serious development, which is nice, even if i don't want my thighs to get even bigger than they already are.

so now is fall break :) yayness even if i have lots of work to do.  it's refreshing not to have to speak spanish (although that too is slowly getting easier, i am never going to get the subjunctive. it doesn't make any fucking sense), not to have to hear professor thomas refer to himself in the third person...and not to have to walk up to pitzer, but actually on second thought, that's only once a week and i do have that class next wednesday. hmmm.

yes so now i am curled up in my papasan feeling yucky while the rest of the world is out having fun...meh, i can make my own fun, inside my head."

"event","so what am i not doing? that's right, homework. i'm kind of really spaced out right now, the way i was last summer, and i'm having a hard time thinking coherently. it's very odd.  possibly i slept too much last night. who knows.

so, i FINALLY got the new computer, last wednesday morning. it was tough to get, what with the having to drive to La Verne because the mailroom wouldn't accept it for some completely unknown reason. they also lied to me and told me there was no redelivery slip, which mysteriously appeared in my box three days after they lied to me about it. gee whiz.  what is with the mailroom and blatant lies? i mean hello, i do grasp the basics of package delivery. if the USPS tries to deliver something and fails for whatever reason, they leave a slip.  and they don't lie about it.  which the mailroom apparently does.  you know, everytime this happens i want to get a post office box off campus more and more.

but yes, the computer is here, and it is good. it works! which is more than i was ever really able to say for the HP.  it also has a bigger monitor, which is very nice. i like the monitor, it's hella quality.  i have it set on the biggest resolution it'll take, even though that meant i had to play with the fonts to make them actually visible.  it's fun to be like ""wheee, look at my computer screen.""

oh and anne has moved to studio city, which is highly exciting. now we can get together more than like, twice a year.  score.

i also have only vague memories of all of last night. heh. heh.  i seem to recall there being some aquateen goodness, though. that show kicks some serious ass.

you know, it's really good to be in college.  while in some sense i have this urge to move on, and be a part of the world, and not live in this disney world of unreality anymore, at the same time, i love it here.  i want so much out of life, but will i ever get it all?  i feel sometimes like i should just stay here, because it's fun and not hard and will it ever be better than this?  i remember in high school people would say to me ""these are the best years of your life"" and i would laugh in their faces, because high school was so horrifically boring and annoying.  i mean, if high school was going to be the best part of my life, i probably would have been better off dead.  but now i like life, and what if it goes back to being crappy again? what will i do?

yeah, that was really happy. 

mmmm i saw radiohead in san diego. they kicked SO much ass, i cannot even express just how much ass they kicked.  they played how to disappear completely and it was utterly amazing.  god life is good. :)"

"event","so yes, many things have been happening, not all of which are appropriately mentioned here, because my theory is, there are things that people just don't want to know. seriously.

of course you all DO know that my computer kicked the bucket. currently, it is living in dylan's closet while i wait for my new one to arrive (har har, one day that computer will have to come out of the closet...wait that wasn't funny.)  i have acquired a new job, and will be seeing radiohead tomorrow, both of which are good things. in other bad news, the ASPC feels it is necessary to not pay me for work i did for them.  which, really, is a crooked-ass thing to do.  so why am i now a salaried employee for them? god knows. they still owe me $100 from last year.  and i shouldn't have to do anything to get that money, being as how it's mine. and i don't really appreciate adult members of the ASPC emailing me and telling me i'm irresponsible and that's why i don't get my money. not cool. 

what else...i have seriously slept like 12 hours today, and i think that soon i will go to sleep and sleep more. and then will probably sleep more tomorrow, although i've got some homework to do.  oh well.  i am also addicted to lunabars, and going through terrible Internet withdrawal, although i get occasional fixes on robin's computer, like now.

oh! i've sold two books in the past three days on half.com. that is a good thing, although i think i've been to the post office so much that they actually know my face now.  that's okay though, i generally like postal workers.  especially the one on friday who bitched out post office policy to me while i giggled madly. hehe. if you had to follow their stupid rules, you'd go postal too, i'm telling you.

okay, now that there are no longer any people yelling the names of random sauces in the courtyard (""A1!!! HOLLENDAISE!!!"") i think i will go to bed."

Yeah fun fun. I am being a non-partying loser tonight, but that may have something to do with the fact that I partied like EVERY FUCKING NIGHT this week, and now I'm tired of it. Very tired.

So this is my schedule for next week:
Monday 10am pilates, 11am spanish, 1:15pm SPANISH FINAL, 7pm comparative fascism
Tuesday 9:35 Spanish, 1:15 Spanish Test, 2:45 Anthro
Wednesday 10am pilates, 11am spanish where a paper is due!

But in good news, I had a midterm and a final get cancelled. Waahoo."

the gas station in downtown comstock park, where i lived from age 7-12. 
my mom and brother chasing me around the house trying to get me to be social when i didn't feel like it.
locking them out of a fucked-up version of the garage we had from ages 12-18.
going to my favorite high-school lunch table only to discover that the entire cast of dawson's creek was already there. proceeded to eat with dawson's creek people.
my kitty not letting me pet her. :(
a ferret attacking dylan, who, in said dream, lives next door.

"event","the fascism is killing me. i can't take it any more. it's bad enough having tons of brain-numbing spanish to do without having to read three things about the THEORIES of fascism, and ALL of them say the same thing.......i'm gonna go insane. they even fucking quote each other constantly! i don't take history classes to learn stupid inconsequential theories!

thank god i picked anthopology as my major. anthropology kicks serious ass. fun and cool and interesting, and you constantly get to explain to people what, exactly, anthropology is and that no, it does not involve Indiana Jones.

speaking of which, there is totally a new Indiana Jones movie coming out. it's been like what...14 years since the last one? and since i believe this one won't actually be coming out for another year or two...yeah. harrison ford is older than the hills. sean connery, by my best estimation, has always been older than the hills. at least kate capshaw isn't in it. that makes me very happy, as she is highly annoying. i never understood how indy was attracted to her in temple of doom; i wanted to throw her into the pit and have her sacrificed, personally.

hmmm...i'm quite hungry. which isn't too good, because dinner isn't for a while. but wait! we are saved! other schools open at normal times! whooohoo!

i have already begun searching out my halloween outfit. i highly desire to match the ""renaissance corset"" from frederick's of hollywood with a kickass billowy linen skirt, but alas, the corset by itself is $64. if i don't get another job, $64 is gonna be a whole paycheck for me.  ooh, maybe i'll get sara to ship me a dress! ey sara, you reading this?

my current goal for the year: do not pass out drunk in other people's rooms on harwood halloween. instead, actually go to harwood halloween, even if it means i only go for a second because it's in a tightly enclosed space.

second goal for the year: get laid.

i really have no idea which one i'll be more likely to succeed at."

"event","i can't figure this out. not that i've been at all drunk in my drinking of late, as i am trying to very slowly reintroduce my poor tummy to the concept of alcohol. tonight i had three drinks, which seemingly had no effect other than to make me very overheated, which actually caused me to leave liz & megan's party because i was so freakin' hot. but i feel okay now, so it's all good.

mmmm...cheese and crackers good...but must put away before i become fat. fat bad. not good for scoring ass, which i desperately need. therefore, i also desperately need guys i don't know, which means i need to start attending parties elsewhere, cuz really, our parties rock, but there is a severe lack of guy-ness. cmc anyone? pitzer? hmc? or scripps...heh heh.

god it's been sooooooooo long...i feel like a nun.

oh by the way...couch thieves...i will find you and then you will be in serious fucking trouble. a. you better hope there's somebody with me because otherwise i will try my hardest to both pulverize your balls and scratch your eyeballs out. i figure with damaged balls and blind, you won't reproduce to form more of your kind.  b, you better hope i don't call the fucking admins on you because then you will be in a shitload of trouble. i should go check what the penalty for theft is. ah here we go, number 4 in the student code: attempted or actual theft or wrongful appropriation of or damage to property of the colleges or property of a member of the college community.

not that the couch thief would be reading this. i hope.

"event","had another dream about my dad last night. not that i don't like dreaming about him, but i really DON'T like it when he takes on the villain role in my dreams. maybe i have some kind of repressed anger going on...who the hell knows.

so apparently matt is at smokeforce right now, which i am not at, because i am lazy and sleepy and very slightly intoxicated.  yes, that's right, we boozed it up on a wednesday night.  life is for living, you know?

hmmm...it appears the peach i stole from that stupid scripps-festival-dinner thing tonight should be ripe soon. not that anyone cares but me, but hell, it makes me happy.

GRRRRR...somebody left krispy kremes in my room...GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

PEOPLE STOP LEAVING YOUR FUCKING FOOD IN MY ROOM, IT'S REALLY PISSING ME OFF. isn't my room messy enough already without other people contributing to the mess?"

"event","because i am so so so so sick of it. and therefore, have ceased doing it.  

so what has been up the past few days...got into the class i wanted, comparative fascism. amusingly enough, on my new schedule, the word ""fascism"" is spelled ""facism."" at a school like pomona, that amuses me greatly.

what else...had a very strange dream about my dad the other night. he does pop up in my dreams occasionally, and almost always he is magically back in our lives with no apparent explanation; the dreams never take place in the past. they're also very strange because the subconscious of me knows that my father is dead and wants to question his presence, but that part doesn't seem to realize it's a dream, and the dream-me never says anything about it. on this particular dream, we were on some kind of trip...and he kept wanting to move on and move on. once in  the dream he startled me, playing some kind of joke on me, and he and my mom laughed, which was very odd because my dad never did stuff like that.  i wonder if dreams really mean anything? because seriously, i have some weird-ass dreams.  lately, they have all involved road trips of some kind. once i was dreaming about the trip with dylan, only we were on route 66 for real, and then another time, i dreamed that i was driving with a group of cars up in the mountains, and my car was struggling (poor cochita!) but when i reached the top of the road, i saw the most stunning view.

so what else...so much spanish it's ridiculous.  my other classes seem okay, although the readings for sex, body and reproduction have as of yet been a repeat from my frosh year feminist philosophy class, which is annoying.

cathy hasn't called me with my work hours yet. i better go see her tomorrow.

hmmm...my room is very nice.  it is big and airy and fits all my stuff.  and it has robin (whose bedsprings i can currently hear bouncing) and a private bathroom! however, people keep leaving things like Nasty Cranberry Bread and bbq sauce in my room. not cool people. 

hmmm...my laundry will be done soon. must stay awake..."

"event","after a five day road trip, mad unpacking, mad moving from storage, more unpacking, more moving from storage, unpacking again, and some computer fixing.  well, a lot of all of those things.

the really sad thing is that school hasn't started yet and i'm already doing laundry, because i have tons of dirty towels from last year and lots of dirty clothes from the road trip.

so let's briefly recount said road trip:
after mad last minute packing and the apparent forgetting of several things, i managed to detach my mother from my side. i set off down the road for a gast station i knew had an ATM.  well, there was gas, but their ATM was broken.  annoyed, i set out on the road to find an ATM, which wound up taking 20 minutes, because apparently, there are no ATMs anywhere in the entire town of jenison, even at the banks (i'm totally not kidding or exaggerating).  then, i got on the freeway at an unfamiliar entrance, and because i was so annoyed, i didn't notice for five minutes that i was going the wrong way.  so it was about forty minutes until i was finally headed in the right direction -- that being southwest.

i stopped after about an hour and a half to get a snack and was promptly accosted by a weird guy in a red truck, who came up to me demanding to know what kind of car i had.  i looked around to make sure there were plenty of bystanders, and told him what it was (not that it SAID IT on the car, or anything!). he continued to question me about it until i managed to escape into the store.  when i came back out, he was still there, so i got in my car and locked the doors and waited for him to leave, which he did after about five minutes.  then i waited a bit longer to leave, in case he was really a total psycho or something.

so i finally made it to chicago and ran into traffic, which was amazing, because you couldn't get much further from rush hour than noon.  but apparently it is always rush hour in chicago. and also, it was very cloudy, even though it was sunny in grand rapids.  i have yet to witness a sunny day in chicago. weirdness.

then i had the great fortune of travelling the entire length of illinois; an experience which rivalled nebraska and which hopefully i will never have to repeat.  there was one quasi-exciting moment, when smoke covered the road and i couldn't see, but when i got past it, i looked behind me and there was a car on fire at a rest area.  so i picked up my cell and called 911 and asked them if anyone else had called 911 about this after telling them where it was, and they said no! how unbelievable is that! you know, i'd like to think people are inherently good, but i keep getting proved wrong.

well anyways, then i arrived at dylan's uncle Tom's house in st louis, which is a city that i always forget how pretty it is. his house was in the wash u st louis area, which was very nice and collegy.  we spent the night there, and took off early the next morning.

much to my IMMENSE surprise, we were driving through the ozarks and they were gorgeous! talk about total shock.  rolling hills, forests and rivers and lakes.  beautiful.  it also reminded me, in terms of roadside tourist traps, of the freeways down to florida when i was a kid. however, it soon became very clear how john ass-croft is from this beautiful state: beside pretty much every ad for trucker's porn shops, there was an ad saying ""PORN DESTROYS LIVES!!!"" or something ridiculous like that.  there were also billboards saying random bible verses every 50 miles or so. apparently, southern missouri must be much like western michigan in that it is quite pretty, but the people are psycho. personally, i feel that all psychos should live in nebraska. and illinois.

next state up: oklahoma.  as soon as we entered, we kept seeing these signs that said DO NOT DRIVE THROUGH SMOKE.  very confusing, as there was neither smoke nor forests nor even really dry brushland where smoke was likely to occur.  oklahoma was fairly green and not nearly as ugly as i thought it would be, at least for the first half.  then we came to, of all the ridiculous things, the World's Largest McDonald's, which actually stretches across the freeway.  dylan insisted on stopping and taking pictures, which i acquiesced to only grudgingly.  then we hit tulsa, where we watched the psychotic drivers run other people off the road.  then onto oklahoma city, where we got stuck in rush hour traffic (not a big surprise).  afterwards, it was another half hour to the Best Western in el reno, where we had a reservation.  it was very nice for a best western, and also very cheap. i pretty much fell asleep as soon as we got into the room, although i did manage to awaken myself for a nip/tuck rerun.

so the next day is essentially the ""bad day."" a lot of oklahoma, a lot of texas, and a lot of new mexico. oklahoma from this point on is quite flat and ugly, ranchland mostly, a trend that continues on into texas.  i discovered that i had no cell phone service in texas, which was most disappointing, because i really really wanted to call my mom and yell ""DON'T MESS WITH TEXASSSSSSSSS!"" into the phone.  we continued on into new mexico, which VERY suddenly became quite pretty, if very hot and practically endless.  eventually we hit albuquerque, and decided to go on further, as we weren't that tired.  eventually we ran into a nasty rainstorm outside of grants, new mexico, though, so we stopped there for the night, in another slightly less nice best western.  dylan randomly went out and bought the second lord of the rings movie at the wal-mart there.  

next morning, we set out early again because we wanted to hit sedona early in the afternoon.  flagstaff -- utterly gorgeous, and i finally had cell reception again once i was there, so i called to inquire as to whether i could come back early and get my key, and where my stuff was in on campus storage, and the answers were yes, and in gibson.  so then i called and cancelled the reservation for our hotel in ontario.  from there we turned onto a little state road to get down to sedona, and it was a very striking and fun drive -- down a giant canyon, in which sedona resides.  we found our hotel there, which was very nice, especially for that price in sedona.  sedona was gorgeous. we went shopping and i got my mom a birthday present.  then we went out for a nice mexican dinner, which was very yummy.  then we came back and hung out and watched LOTR (yes, we are lame.) 

we got up early yet again the next day and headed to phoenix, which was problem free, except for as soon as we got on the 10, there was a HUGE traffic jam, which we discovered was the result of a horrible and certainly fatal car-semi crash. literally, both the semi and the little car were crushed to bits; to be honest, i can't be sure if it even WAS a little car.  i have no idea how that could have happened, but it was terrible to see.

after that we were in a big hurry to get home, so we drove fast and didn't really stop.  we arrived in claremont at about 3, having to dodge herds of frosh roaming the streets instead of the sidewalks. argh.  we got our keys and promptly started unpacking the crap from our cars, then drove out to the storage place and got about half my stuff and all dylan's stuff, except for his linens, which were in on-campus storage with the rest of my stuff.  so i went up to target, trying to ignore my total physical exhaustion, and got some supplies.  then i collapsed in my bed, even though Frosh Aid was going on.

next morning, i got up and wandered around aimlessly until i convinced shua to help me get my crap out of on campus storage.  then i unpacked, then i fixed my )*!#$)*!#^$)(&!#^)$&( computer, then i went to the airport to pick up matt & robin, who had lots and lots and lots of stuff.  and i pretty much haven't gone anywhere since then, just lots of lazing about.

yeah i'm sick of writing this, so away with it."

my dog is wandering around in the epitome of total patheticness.  he follows me everywhere and cries, because he knows i'm leaving.  the cat just glares at me suspiciously.  right now he's sitting next to me, whimpering.

"event","I'm slow in realising that the author who wrote ""The Mortal Instruments"" series is the same person who wrote ""The Draco Trilogy"" series that led to the biggest plagiarism wank of all time for the HP-fanfic fandom. Then again, I have never read any of her works and I would have continued on blissfully ignorant if not for a friend who brought up the name ""Cassandra Clare"". Though it does make me ponder the idea of returning to fanfic writing seeing how big some of them have become despite the mediocre plot and characterisation *cough*50shades*cough*

I should get back to trying to answer the <i>cheem</i> questions my lecturer set regarding SPED and special needs children. Kind of wish for one of those self-writing quills to jot down everything I have said because I have such a hard time transferring them to written words. And I made such a compelling speech to my aniki to boot.

me: do you know what's hyperlexia? 
aniki: is that when someone gets so cold they freeze their balls off? 
me: that's hypothermia."

Did I even look okay that day? It was so tiring rushing from class to Nex (even if it was next to my school but the standing for almost 2 hours) to Cathay.

On the flip side, work did not approve my leave citing that I have not been present for a lot of planning time. How is that MY fault when they are the ones who decided to send me for a full-time study right before June term break? All I am asking for is 5-days leave in DECEMBER when I have no class and there is no kids to teach to have a proper holiday with my family!

Pissed off does not even graze the tip of how I am feeling right now. I feel even more disappointed especially after personally asking the SP if I can take off and she said ""Sure not a problem"" only to get stabbed like this. And the VP lurking around causing trouble is seriously treading on my last patience."

"event","just gonna post this up for my own understanding because it is way easier when you can associate yourself with all these old men theories:

uncle piaget says you must learn by yourself and there are 4 stages to cognitive development. sensorimotor is from 0 to 2 years, preoperational is from 2 to 7, concrete operational is from 7 to 11 and formal operational is from 11 onwards and since we are doing early childhood we concentrate on sensorimotor which is further divided into 6 substages: reflexes from birth to 1 month, primary circular reaction from 1 to 4 months, secondary circular reactions from 4 to 8 months, coordination of secondary circular reaction from 8 to 12 months, tertiary circular reactions from 12 to 18 months and mental representation from 18 to 24 months.

but uncle piaget he is a bit of a loner so he doesn't think that you need ppl. so in comes uncle vygotsky who says no we must have ppl and human interaction because culture and all that shitz is important. piaget says you cannot skip a stage in development, vygotsky agree but he says that you can instead speed up the stage if you have others around to help you. unfortunately uncle vygotsky died young from tb and they never got to meet up to discuss things in depth.

then comes uncle bruner (who is still alive btw) talking about constructivist theory which i am still reading up on. scaffolding is his idea whereby a child with the guidance of a more knowledgeable person can narrow the gap of zone of proximal development faster."

ppl! don't waste perfectly good food even if you are sick and tired of eggs. go cook at the kitchen not the bedroom or if you are practising your juggling - use balls! or at least, close your window so that it won't drop into the room of the person living on the 2nd floor."

ps. congrats to aljunied grc for going to the opposition! we salute the people there even if they lost george yeo. you don't need to get on your knees and repent... except maybe pray for tpl to go away- far, far away with her *act cute* and hit her with a real spade not just kate."

"event","Today was a pretty great day in Meganland. I got up and went to church, and afterward took my Aunt out to lunch and a movie for her birthday. We ate at Chili's: Guiltless Grill Chicken Sandwich......you know, cause we gotta watch the figures. Then we saw P.S. I Love You! It was a total chick flick and a total HOTTIE overload. You can't go wrong with chick flicks.....you just can't.<br /><br />After I got home from the movies, I grabbed my grocery list and headed out to Wally world to obtain some grindage for this week. It really sucks going to the store when you're on a diet and you're hungry. I did good and only bought healthy things, so I rewarded myself with Subway for dinner. YUM!<div><div><div></div><div><br />My sister and I watched ""Persuasion"" on Masterpiece Theater tonight.....so good! Jane Austen really knows how to write the perfect love story. Anne Elliot, the main character, is 27 and unmarried (I can relate). She was considered an old maid and totally unmarriagable. Does this mean I'm a spinster? Spinster House at your service. Why can't I have some totally incredible and devastating romance in my life. .</div><div></div><div><br />I suppose that's all for now.......back to the salt mill tomorrow. I am seriously praying that the Lord will help me deal with my current trainee. She irritates the snot out of me for some reason, but I am trying to be kind.</div></div></div><br />&nbsp;"

"event","Hey there everybody!  I finally got all my Christmas shopping done!!  Yesterday was torture because I found out the laptop backpack that I had gotten my dad was not the one he wanted.  That one had to go back to the store, and then I was running all over town to every office type place, and no one had it in stock.  I finally ended up having to buy it on amazon.com, wrapping a picture of it and writing on it that he will get it on Wednesday.  Nice, huh?  Oh well, at least he'll get what he wanted.  I kind of went overboard this year since my parents are going through some financial woe.  I really hope everyone likes their presents!

My dad made one of those jibjab snowball fights with all of our boxers!  My parents have two boxers, we have two, and my brother has one......it's pretty darn cute.  You can go <a href=""http://www.jibjab.com/sendables/view/CaIB04VzvLoJzBMvNLwzUaBQ"">here</a> to see it!

"event","Hello all!&nbsp; Just stopping in quickly to&nbsp;post.&nbsp; It's been a super long week........we had to let someone go&nbsp;yesterday&nbsp;who just wasn't getting the material.&nbsp; I feel really bad and like a failure, but it had been&nbsp;over 3 weeks and she still wasn't&nbsp;catching on well.&nbsp; Then there's some family drama going on that I can't really get into.&nbsp; All in all......pretty crappy day. 

This past weekend I saw two movies:&nbsp; Enchanted and August Rush.&nbsp; I have to say that I loved them both.&nbsp; Enchanted was really funny and just made me feel good......I left the&nbsp;theatre in such a&nbsp;cheerful mood and humming all the songs.&nbsp; I loved the way that it made fun of itself, and Patrick Dempsey looked great. 

August Rush was very good as well.&nbsp; I don't think it's for everyone and could definitely be classified as a chick flick.&nbsp; There are a LOT of unbelievable parts of it, but if you disregard that, it's very good.&nbsp; Again with this movie.......very good music.&nbsp; I love the soundtrack to pieces.&nbsp; Jonathan Rhys-Meyers sings in it and does a really good job.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would recommend it for a feel-good chick flick.&nbsp; If you're looking for some dramatic indie movie, this ain't it.&nbsp; I thought it might be from the previews, but no.&nbsp; I left there smiling though, so it was all okay! 

I hope you are all doing well.&nbsp; I am so thankful this week is over to tell you the truth.&nbsp; I need to start fresh as of tomorrow!"

My dad went into the hospital recently.&nbsp; His blood sugar had spun so far out of&nbsp;control that it caused him to have a small stroke and then caused him to have severe stomach cramps and muscle contractions.&nbsp; He was in the hospital having lots of tests and&nbsp;being under supervision for quite a while, but long&nbsp;story short, he's out now.&nbsp; He still has a slight limp from the stroke, but he's getting his blood sugar back to where it should be.&nbsp; The only problem is that&nbsp;he&nbsp;will not be able to drive truck anymore.&nbsp; It's been really hard for my parents and family to deal with all of this on top of my dad being out of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, after lots of prayer, he found a new job this week and will soon be back to work!!

The other thing that's been&nbsp;going on is that I got that promotion at work!!&nbsp; It&nbsp;has been so&nbsp;difficult trying to get settled into this position and all the work and responsibility it entails.&nbsp; I am telling you, I've barely had time to&nbsp;breathe!

I know that some of&nbsp;my friends have&nbsp;probably deleted me, and a lot of you probably wrote me off as a lost&nbsp;cause, but things are finally calming down and I should be able to get&nbsp;back to&nbsp;catching up with&nbsp;everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I hope you all have a Happy Thanksgiving!! &nbsp;"

Tomorrow I leave for my vacation to Atlanta and Savannah, GA, and at the end of the week I'll be going to a release party for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.....I'm so majorly excited!!  I saw the movie on Wednesday, and it was simply amazing!  Definitely my favorite Potter movie thus far by leaps and bounds!

Ok guys, I got a new shift at work recently, and since I finally get off at a decent hour, I've made a big decision.....I'm going back to school!  I've been thinking about it, and I really really don't want to do what I do now forever.  I mean, I make good money, and probably more than I'd make being a teacher, but it just doesn't make me happy.  I really like being in school, and I miss utilizing my brain and learning new things.  This is going to be a big and costly step for me, but I really think it's the right one.  I'm praying that everything will work out so that I can go to school at night when I get off of work, and this way I won't have to change my schedule, since that takes an act of Congress nearly at my job.  I'm kind of excited about this!  

As of tonight, I'm officially going on internet lockdown so that I will not be spoiled in any manner for the Harry Potter book, and also, I'll be on vacation, so I won't be able to catch up to y'all's journals until after, but I promise, promise, promise that when I get back, I will definitely do this!  I really have missed you guys!  I hope everything is going well for you all!  I loves yas!"

"event","I was just thinking......I need to update more.&nbsp; I've gotten pretty bad about posting journals lately, but hopefully I can start updating regularly again.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, Happy belated Mother's Day to all the Mothers on my f-list!&nbsp;&nbsp;My family went out to eat&nbsp;with my Mom and had a pretty good time just being together.&nbsp; Of course, this outing was preceded by one of our famous&nbsp;insane fights about nothing that get blown out of proportion, but that's neither here nor there.&nbsp; My family is so strange LOL!&nbsp; We can seriously be fighting with&nbsp;each other one minute and the next be&nbsp;happy as can be.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's because we're&nbsp;a very close-knit&nbsp;group.&nbsp; I've had friends actually tell me that&nbsp;our family's too close........not so.&nbsp; We just love each other, and have learned through some pretty hard-knocks that there are very few people in this world you can truly count on, and we back each other up 100%.&nbsp; We don't always get along perfectly, but we&nbsp;get over it fairly quick.......well, most&nbsp;of us anyways.&nbsp; My dad is sort of a grudge-holder.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time my sister and I moved out and got an apartment, he didn't speak to us for 3 months.......a very long&nbsp;3 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;We tried to resolve the issue, but there's one&nbsp;sure trait my family members all share, and that's pigheadedness.&nbsp; One day, though, things were just okay again.&nbsp; We helped them move and he&nbsp;helped us get our dog, so that made it all better LOL!&nbsp; We don't really talk and resolve our issues, we sort of just let them be over.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Wow, that&nbsp;just kept on going, didn't it?&nbsp; I don't know where it came from, as that was not what&nbsp;I was going to post about, but anyways.....also, yesterday my Mom got a brand new car!&nbsp; A 2007 Nissan Sentra, and she is so excited!&nbsp;&nbsp;She has really been in need of a car for awhile now, and she truly deserves this, so I'm really&nbsp;happy for her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a picture of us when I was a little girl:<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Me and my mommy!""><img alt="""" src=""http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/9972/scannedpics004ou9.jpg"" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br /><br />Here's another thing that's been on my mind.......the subject of my love life.&nbsp; Ok, so I firmly believe that God is going to send me the right person when it's time, and I'm trying to pray about it and be content with it, but why does everyone have to keep bringing it up?!&nbsp; Every time it's the same thing......you're too picky, Megan, or you have a wall up, Megan.&nbsp; I just don't agree with this!&nbsp; I am fully open to the possibility of meeting someone, it just never seems to happen.&nbsp; I'm not the kind of girl that guys just naturally gravitate to.&nbsp; I'm the kind of girl that&nbsp;a guy has to get to know, and then to like.&nbsp; My sister tried to set me up with this guy who liked her first!!!!&nbsp; NOO!!&nbsp; I do not want her sloppy seconds!&nbsp; She is way prettier than me, and any guy who would like her is sure not to want to take a second glance at me.&nbsp; I'm not picky.....I don't think this makes me picky.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In regards to this ""wall"" I have up........I'm just a naturally shy person.&nbsp; It took me years to break out of my shell, and this only occurred after I got into doing plays and performing on stage, but that girl still lives inside me.&nbsp; When I get to know someone, I can't be shut up, but put me next to a stranger, and I revert.....very quickly.&nbsp; Lots of people in my family find nothing wrong with conversing with total strangers.......I just can't do it.&nbsp; And it mortifies me when they do it.&nbsp; It has taken me a long time to get to where I am now.&nbsp; They don't recognize that I do the best that I can.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Another problem is that I really don't have any place to meet guys.&nbsp; I don't go out to clubs or bars, or any kind of party scene.&nbsp; My work is filled with women and men who are either gay, married, or old.&nbsp; My church is a very small church, and all the males there are either related to me or old.&nbsp; And I think we've established that the only type of guys I meet at our concerts are old people.......because that is our target audience (southern gospel does not draw the young crowd).&nbsp; What should I do?&nbsp; Someone even had the nerve to suggest match.com......excuse me, I do not need Dr. Phil to find me a husband.&nbsp; YIKES!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I know everyone means well, but I feel like Bridget Jones........the single girl in a sea of ""smug marrieds"".&nbsp; *sigh*<br /><br />Now that I've ranted and raved, I guess I should close this thing out.&nbsp; Before I go, I will give a few TV show and movie thoughts:<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Heroes, LOST, Grey's, Supernatural, American Idol, and Spiderman 3!"">Heroes--the freaking best show on television.&nbsp; The stuff with Hiro and his dad was amazing tonight, and I love how everyone has converged on this city.&nbsp; Linderman's death was so kick-butt!&nbsp; DL must live.&nbsp; The montage at the end was so perfect, and then Sylar's creepy self ""Boom""........next week's season finale is going to be amazing!<br /><br />LOST--has been blowing my mind lately.&nbsp; The Jacob stuff was so creepy, and Ben is a psychopath.&nbsp; I love Juliet.....I don't care if she's good or bad, I just frickin' love her.&nbsp; One of the most interesting characters to come along on that show.&nbsp; I almost care more about her than the regular Losties.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Grey's Anatomy--has been ticking me off royally.&nbsp; I'm so sick of the Meredith/Derek yo-yo......I want off this train.&nbsp; I can't ride it anymore, I'm getting seasick.&nbsp; George/Izzie was weird at first, but I'm slowly warming up to it.&nbsp; The elevator kiss was smokin' hot.&nbsp; I feel bad for Callie, cause I love her so.&nbsp; Christina and Burke need to get it together.&nbsp; I know everyone had different reactions to the spin-off episode, but I really loved it.&nbsp; I can't wait for the show, and I will definitely be watching.....if only for Tim Daly, whom I have loved for years, and is still frickin' fine (and needs to be on my screen since The Nine got cancelled :()&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />American Idol--has been b-o-r-i-n-g this year.&nbsp; I really don't care who wins.&nbsp; Isn't that sad?&nbsp; Of course I will tune in, but it will be who it is, and I won't be voting.<br /><br />Supernatural--rocks my socks.&nbsp; Truly one of the best shows that nobody's watching.&nbsp; It has all the elements that I love, and hello......super hot boys.&nbsp; Sammy must live!&nbsp; Dean is my man......back off, women!<br /><br />Spiderman 3--sucked.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; I loved Tobey in the first two movies, but he just stunk it up in this one.&nbsp; If I saw any more tears roll down his face, I was going to scream.&nbsp; And one thing I can't get over.......he hit her.&nbsp; I don't care if it was Evil Spidey.......he hit her.&nbsp; Harry was the best thing about the movie, and then they marred James Franco's lovely face, and then had a crappy ending for him.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; I just hated it.&nbsp; I couldn't help it.</div><br /><br />And that's all I've got people.&nbsp; This is what happens when you bottle stuff up forever.&nbsp; Please comment me if you love me.&nbsp; I hope you all have some wonderful days ahead of you!&nbsp; LOVE!"

"event","So, I took a much-needed vacation today......from my computer LOL!&nbsp; It seems as though I've been chained to this thing day in and day out lately.&nbsp; Sometimes you just have to walk away.&nbsp;

I've had a pretty enjoyable weekend so far!!&nbsp; Last night, I went to dinner with my aunt, and then we came back and watched the movie Shaun of the Dead.&nbsp; I must say......it's flippin' hilarious.&nbsp; We were&nbsp;searching through the guide, saw it on Comedy Central, and decided to watch it.&nbsp; She'd seen it before, but she still laughed just as hard as I did.&nbsp; I love British humor......it's so sarcastic and much more subtle than the in-your-face comedy of ours, and I just get it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus accents......you can't beat accents.&nbsp; It's just a fact.&nbsp; Anyways, I highly reccommend it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Today, I went to change over my insurance on my new car.&nbsp; I used to have an '03 Oldsmobile Alero, and when I swapped it to the '07 Chevrolet HHR........THE PRICE WENT DOWN!!!!&nbsp; SURPRISE!&nbsp; I was so happy......you don't even know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

After the jubilation of the insurance reduced price, I went and got my hair colored (you know, I needed my roots did), and my eyebrows waxed.&nbsp; The waxing of the brows is not a pleasant experience, but after the billionth strip gets pulled off, you sort of get numb to the pain.

Then, with my newly colored hair and my hairless brows, I went out with my aunt and sister to eat at Smokey Bones.&nbsp; We all three ordered a side item and a dessert.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we receive our dessert FIRST.&nbsp; WHAT?&nbsp; I was in shock at the lack of common sense, but decided to reign in my annoyance.&nbsp; In the words of my aunt, ""He might be new.""&nbsp; They then brought out our side items.......and big shocker, they had messed up the order.&nbsp; I ordered mashed potatoes and they brought me a baked potato.&nbsp; OY!&nbsp; I made them change it, cause I&nbsp;was just not in the mood for&nbsp;potatoes of the baked variety.&nbsp;So tonight I had apple cobbler, followed by mashed potatoes.&nbsp; Interesting.

After the dinner fiasco, we headed over to the theater to see Blades of Glory.&nbsp; This movie was ridiculously stupid.........and I loved it!!&nbsp; LOL!&nbsp; There's something wonderful about a movie that's just so bad you have to love it.&nbsp; It was complete with gross-outs, innuendoes, and even a licking the public&nbsp;bathroom floor scene.&nbsp; Throw in Will Ferrell, and you've got yourself a hit, people.&nbsp; I laughed hysterically, and would recommend it if you like&nbsp;stupid humor......which I do!&nbsp; :)

This brings you up-to-date on my&nbsp;current weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sure what all tomorrow entails,&nbsp;except for church in the morning, but it can only get better, right?&nbsp; Why are weekends so short?&nbsp; I think we should work on weekends, and have 5 days&nbsp;off a week.&nbsp; This makes much&nbsp;more sense to me.

Hope you are all having&nbsp;as wonderful a time as me!&nbsp; Love yas!"

Once a couple more people are gone, I'm out.<br /><br />I guess I've rambled on long enough......I hope you're all doing well and having incredible weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Happy Birthday to my cousin,&nbsp;&nbsp;<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://autumnclarity.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://autumnclarity.livejournal.com/""><b>autumnclarity</b></a></div>!!!!&nbsp; I made you a little present, cause I loves you!!<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Happy Birthday, E!!""><img alt="""" src=""http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/6905/xstudio01snapehu2.jpg"" /></div>"

It's about everyone around you at work getting hugongous flower arrangements and life-size stuffed animals and diamonds and candy.

And you sitting there with nothing&nbsp;watching everyone ooh and aaah and compare their gifts, trying to one-up each other.

Oy.......it's days like these that make me want to scream.

Maybe I'm sick of all this crap and think it's really stupid......

or more likely, I'm jealous of all this and wish I had a cool gift to lord over someone's head.

Oh well......my Mom and Dad at least called to wish me Happy V-day and tell me they love me.

I am loved by someone at least.

I hope you were all loved by someone.....and if not, you're loved by ME!!&nbsp; ;-)"

Whoa.&nbsp; House and the doctor who stole his parking space.&nbsp; He's so wrong, and I love it!&nbsp; I am telling you Hugh Laurie is a genius.

LOST comes back tomorrow night!!!&nbsp; My sis and BIL asked me to go somewhere with them, but I told them I had plans with my television.&nbsp; Hello.....I've been waiting on this for awhile.

So, I'm kind of sick of my job.&nbsp; It's so boring.&nbsp; The only mental stimulation I get is from my iPod.....this is a sad state of affairs.&nbsp; I thrive on pressure.......I thrive on facing and solving problems.&nbsp; Something must be done.&nbsp; I am thinking of going back to school for something.......anything.&nbsp; The only problem is.........I have bills.&nbsp; STUPID BILLS.

On the other hand......I make reeeeeeeally good money.&nbsp; Especially for someone who doesn't have a degree.&nbsp; And I love most of the people I work with.....I have some really great friends there.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all so confusing.

I got a new book this weekend, and it is sooooo good.&nbsp; Romance writers never write good historicals anymore, and I've been striking out on that front a lot recently, but I haven't been able to put this one down.&nbsp; ""My Wicked Highlander"" by Jen Holling.....there's just something about a man in a kilt.

Anywho.....I'm in a wierd mood tonight.&nbsp; I feel strange, and I don't know why.&nbsp; Here's a random thought......I just looked at my icon.&nbsp; Patrick Dempsey is so sexeh!

I hope you are all having a super week......talk to you laterz!"

I've moved into the house with my sister and her new husband......it's really kind of....awkward LOL!&nbsp; I mean, I guess it's not that bad, since I mostly just stay in my room and the office (it's sooooo much better now that I have the internet), but still, it's just kind of wierd living with a newlywed couple.&nbsp; It's all lovey-dovey one minute, and all spit-spat the next.&nbsp; We're all being really considerate of each other, and it's strange living with a guy.&nbsp; Let's just say the sun rises and sets with ESPN.....<br /><br />Christmas was a little different this year as we were all really stressed and more than a little strapped due to the wedding.&nbsp; It was still pretty great, though, and I got a crapload of gift cards, a jump drive, and other tchotchkies (sp?).&nbsp; Christmas is my favorite time of year.....I just love the whole mood of it.&nbsp; Somehow it didn't feel like Christmas this year.....maybe due to the fact that it was freaking 70 degrees here.&nbsp; I know I live in the South, and we never get snow or anything, but it's usually at least frigid.&nbsp; Not this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The day after Christmas I woke up sick......turns out I had tonislitis, and i was out of work for several days.&nbsp; All in all, a horrible, terrible, ugly, no-good experience whose final effects are just now leaving me.&nbsp; And then it was time for the wedding....<br /><br />....which turned out beautifully!!!&nbsp; I will post pictures as soon as we get them back!&nbsp; It was a long process getting everything ready, but it was so worth it.&nbsp; My sister had her dream wedding, and that is all that really matters.&nbsp; Boys can skip ahead, cause here will follow a really weepy, detailed synopsis of the wedding from a girl's (and sister's) point of view:<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Crying in the Chapel..."">The day before the wedding all us bridesmaids, my mother, and the bride went to get our nails done.....then we headed to the church to start getting everything ready for the rehearsal dinner.&nbsp; The rehearsal was nice......we went through everything several times.&nbsp; Who knew I would have to fluff the freaking train nine billion times.&nbsp; Any of you future maids of honor just prepare yourself to be on the floor half the ceremony.&nbsp; After the rehearsal dinner, we stayed at the church until early the next morning making more preparations and cleaning.&nbsp; We then had to be back up and at the church at 8 the next morning for the final touches before starting to get ready.&nbsp; Tiredness abounded, and I was in a fine temper up until I finished getting ready and had completed the stuffing of myself into a death contraption known as a bustier and put on a pound of makeup.&nbsp; After that, I helped my sister get into her dress, and then we got word that my dad wanted to come in and see her before it was time.&nbsp; My dad walked into the room and put his arms around her and completely broke down.&nbsp; I am telling you, he was sobbing, Cassie was sobbing, I was sobbing......ok EVERYONE was sobbing.&nbsp; Then he said, ""I love you"" and high-tailed it out of the room, leaving behind a gaggle of females wiping their eyes and rushing to get in front of a mirror and replace the pound of makeup we just cried off.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; My sister made a beautiful bride and everyone else looked really great too.&nbsp; Her colors were red and black, so our dresses were black with a red sash, and that was great for me, cause black is my signature color LOL!&nbsp;&nbsp;We finally heard the final seating song, and knew it was just about time for the wedding to begin.&nbsp; We walked out into the hall, and my sister and I stopped in a room by ourselves so she could fix her garter, and then she asked me to pull her veil over, and then we both started crying again.&nbsp; An extremely emotional sister moment occurred and we had to check our makeup again.&nbsp; The parents and grandparents were seated to ""The Prayer"" by Lauren Tally and David Phelps, and then the bridesmaids walked down the aisle to ""I Know You by&nbsp;Heart"" by Eva Cassidy which was so perfectly beautiful in the&nbsp;wedding, but which is extremely sloooooow.&nbsp; I didn't know how fast to walk, and everyone was all walk to the beat of the music......uh hello, it would take 20 minutes for me to do that, so I just went and I looked like an idiot of course LOL!&nbsp; When I got to the stage, I had to walk up some stairs, and I totally tripped on my dress and almost fell (I knew this was going to happen....).&nbsp; Then came the ring bearer and the flower girls who were adorable.&nbsp; The ringbearer lasted about two seconds before he stretched out on the stage, put the pillow under his head, and decided to take a nap.&nbsp; Oy!&nbsp; Cassie came out with my dad, and Brandon started crying, which in turn made everyone else start crying, and after that, the rest of the wedding is kind of a blur, cause I was too worried about the durn train.&nbsp; I thought the preacher did a really nice job, and it all turned out great.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We took a million and one pictures, and then it was time for the reception.&nbsp; They had a slideshow of&nbsp;pictures of them growing up and them now, which had everyone in tears again.&nbsp; Weddings are total&nbsp;weepfests, I have to say.&nbsp; I had to harrass my sister about the wedding night......you know, going around singing ""I'm not a girl, not yet a woman...""&nbsp; She was totally freaked out, which was understandable, and told me to shut up.&nbsp; And then they left, and we had to clean up.&nbsp; All of that is really a blur, too, as I was so freaking tired I could barely see straight, and my feet hurt so bad it was a chore to walk on them.&nbsp; After all was said and done, we felt like we had accomplished something great, and&nbsp;we were happy because they were happy.&nbsp; That's the way it should be, I think...<br /></div><br />Ok, boys, tune back in, cause now I'm going to talk about electronics!&nbsp; HOOTY HOO!<br /><br />I just got myself a video iPod!!!!!&nbsp; YAYA!&nbsp; I am in obsession mode with it right now.&nbsp; I totally watched a movie at work the other day......yes I did!&nbsp; This iPod rules!&nbsp; Can you sense my excitement over this??&nbsp; Now I'm in the process of downloading&nbsp;anything and everything I can get my hands on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I know you all read about my date from the depths of&nbsp;Hades....well, here's something new.&nbsp; We had a&nbsp;concert the second weekend in January, and guess who shows up????&nbsp; YOU GUESS RIGHT!&nbsp; Crazy boy.&nbsp; And he was like the first one there.....an hour early!!!&nbsp; I am telling you people....I can't take it.&nbsp; I'm a nice, friendly person, but&nbsp;I'm just not interested!!!!&nbsp; And he's totally snowed my mother or something, cause&nbsp;she said, ""I think you should give him another chance!""&nbsp; AHHHH!!&nbsp; Um, no!&nbsp; Later on in the night I heard him&nbsp;tell someone he had to go.....he was a nervous wreck cause he hadn't taken his medication in 3 days!!!!&nbsp; I keeed you not!!&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all.....wierd.....second of all.....why would&nbsp;you just tell that to people....third of all......TAKE YOUR MEDICINE!!!&nbsp; Scary scary....<br /><br />I&nbsp;should probably hit the hay soon.....I just finished watching My Super Ex-Girlfriend on my iPod, and it was super cute!&nbsp; I recommend it for a light, fluffy comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It's so good to be back and in the loop......I missed you guys!!&nbsp; Have a fantabulous&nbsp;Monday, and I'll talk to you all soon!<br /><br />&nbsp;"

"event","Boston has been pretty good since the move here in August, though, I&nbsp;really<br />miss Chicago.&nbsp; Even though I'm not from there it was a such a huge part<br />of my life.&nbsp; Funny, I&nbsp;used to say the same thing about New York when<br />I&nbsp;left there for Chicago 6 years ago. &nbsp; I'm really trying to give his a<br />chance, but I&nbsp;really believe that Chicago is the place for me to be.&nbsp;<br />After getting laid off in May from my job at O'Hare (where I&nbsp;worked for<br />5 years for 2 airlines), I've been in this really strange funk that's<br />been tough to shake.&nbsp; I jumped at the first opportunity to work again<br />in Chicago (which would have been a call back to the company I was<br />furloughed from) but was passed over.&nbsp; Man, I&nbsp;was so hurt.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; It<br />felt like a second kick in the pants from the best job/company I ever<br />had/worked for.&nbsp; I&nbsp;usually don't take things so personally but I&nbsp;felt<br />rejected.&nbsp; So rejected. So much so that I&nbsp;was almost unsure on how to<br />deal with it.&nbsp; The people who held my fate were the people that<br />I&nbsp;worked alongside for two years that I&nbsp;considered friends.&nbsp; Not that<br />I&nbsp;expected to get the job for that reason, I&nbsp;definitely understand that<br />being shortlisted for an interview is not a popularity contest.&nbsp; Hell,<br />I&nbsp;thought my interview was abysmal.&nbsp; I was so nervous because I&nbsp;had to<br />concentrate on being professional to friends which really sent the<br />nerves on fire.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;got the call I&nbsp;was on pins and needles and when<br />I&nbsp;was told that the position was offered to someone else, I&nbsp;had all I<br />could do to not scream and bawl.&nbsp; ORD&nbsp;was my life, I&nbsp;spent my whole<br />career there, I&nbsp;could not understand who could have been better than<br />me.&nbsp; There's not a better airport to work, and not a better person to<br />be there than me.&nbsp; But yet, it happened.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was stunned. &nbsp;I was<br />devastated.&nbsp; Lucky for me I&nbsp;have good friends, who this time, made the<br />difference.&nbsp; That is something I&nbsp;am not used to.&nbsp; I&nbsp;felt a lot better<br />just the next day which is so unlike me, but I&nbsp;am so grateful.&nbsp;<br />Harboring bad feelings is not the way to go, and neither is feeling<br />sorry for myself. &nbsp;Which really shows that I've grown up in so many<br />aspects. Using this outlet to get the story out of my head and<br />'written' down is my last step.<br /><br />So what now?&nbsp; Still lost in transition.&nbsp; That's what I'm struggling with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody needs to be told from me that these times aren't great.&nbsp; The job market is poor.&nbsp; I&nbsp;could be wrong, but of all the job ads I've 'trolled through, I've noticed that employers are looking for insanely overqualified people<br />for menial jobs.&nbsp; For example, I&nbsp;saw an ad for a receptionist.&nbsp; The pay<br />was posted at&nbsp;$12 USD/hr (which was not a typo, I&nbsp;called!)&nbsp;&nbsp; They<br />someone with 6 years experience <u><strong>AND</strong></u><strong> </strong>(NOT&nbsp;OR)<br />a 4 year degree.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was shocked.&nbsp; It just struck me as odd.&nbsp; It seemed<br />like someone with those qualifications should easily be making twice as<br />much or more.&nbsp; Then I&nbsp;thought about it a little.&nbsp; There's a lot of<br />unemployment right now, and I&nbsp;guess that it is the only way employers<br />can 'pre screen' applicants so to speak.&nbsp; It filters out what they<br />don't want before even having to read applications and resumes.&nbsp; Of<br />course that's just my opinion. &nbsp;Can't really be sure.<br /><br />I'll find what I'm looking for.&nbsp; Eventually.&nbsp; Something will cross my path, and I certainly will not spend my time feeling sorry for what I couldn't<br />have.&nbsp; After all, I&nbsp;must stay true to the course I set.<br />"

"event","Wow I just saw my last entry was posted 48 weeks ago.  That's quite a long time.  I'm sure nobody's ever read this since then but whatever.  I'm doing ok, Still working for the airlines, and going to school for international business.  I went to New Orleans for a week at the beginning of June, which was great.  I got a new tattoo.  Now my other one has a new friend.  I also saw the ones i want to get next, so I think i'm going to be pretty set on tattoo ideas for awhile.  I'm really tired because I just got home from work, after having to be there at 1 this afternoon, after leaving there at 3:00 this morning.  Our overnighter was on mechanical in Providence for 10 hours or so, it was nightmarish.  I always envisioned spending a point in my life waiting for Providence....but I don't think it was meant to be like this.  Really makes you think though.  Glad to be writing in this again, i'll really try to remember to keep it up.  I'm gonna go now though because I have to do some studying before i go to sleep.  Good Night!

"event","I just had the most fun time ordering more work uniform pieces off the internet from the company that provides them.....What a geek LOL.  Anyway I got some more diverse uniform parts that I had wanted.  I'm glad the system is up and running.  Anyway, I'm glad to be off from work.  I really needed the rest, unfortunately I only have tomorrow off then I'm on for six days and one off after that.  I'm working for one of my coworkers, he's gone to india for two and a half weeks on for $50 round trip.  A station agreement with British Airways.  I wanna go somewhere too, I just don't want to trade off too much time because I dont' want to work for everyone LOL, I have about a weeks vacation so maybe I can use it at some point.  I want to visit dominican soon so that I can go ahead and get the schooling going.  I'm set on that school and my program of choice is International business concentrating in Spanish.  Muy bien! =D  so anyway with all of that coming this way I'm hoping that work won't impede and vice versa....I've been leaving late the last few nights and not getting home until midnight and that is not fun, but such is life i suppose, I need to get my drivers liscence so I can drive to work to save time.  Only trade off is I won't be saving money so I guess that's double edge.  I only spend about $80 a month in transportation anyway so with insurance and gas I'll probably exceed that in car upkeep.  My brother needed some help financially, so I mailed him a check to help out.  I hope it does.  This was the first month ever I actually had money I could put aside for savings, so I guess it must have been that way.  I could afford it and I could afford for him not to pay me back.  There's always next check to try to make savings. I need to start somewhere, I just really hope I could help him.  That's all for now...

Not that I've had anyone but jon read this I thought it might be interesting.  Anyway I got to leave early and I ended up getting home around 11 PM which is nice because I usually don't get home until almost 12AM.  I found out today that we established a station agreement with Continental Airlines so now I can go fly to Spain yay! =D  just something I wanted to do.....Not much else to say, looking forward to school  I did some research so I'm waiting to recieve the materials.

I went to therapy and my psychiatrist appointments, went walking in the forest preserve, played video games, got a haircut. finally got the oven fixed, rested my tired beat up body (work can be so grueling)  saw Farenheit 9/11  thought it was totally amazing.  Ate freeze pops and shot blow darts at the cieling.  Wow what a ""weekend""  I impress myself, but I feel much much better than I have overall.  Physically and mentally.  Like I said in my last entry, life is good.  I have a lot of things to think about as a result of my therapy session and I look forward to the challenges.  I've decided also that I don't want to be a gate agent forever.  I'm not going to spend the next eight years behind that podium getting verbally abused by morons.  I've decided that I need to better myself and return to school so I can have a better job with a better airline.  I had been planing to return but no I really see the urgency.  I'm going to look up universities that have the kinds of program I'm looking for adn with one degree under my belt I shouldn't have to go for long....I want to study international business and spanish, because I think that would be a good way to look appealing to the international carriers, as well as improving my fluency in Spanish.  I can understand it very well, and read it, but I have trouble speaking.  I'm going to improve that I think....Other than that nothing much else to report, I don't want to go to work tomorrow, but hey, how else can I pay my bills....eh well...I'm glad I'm making more of an effort to write.  It's always been good for me.

I found out some new information about something that had been plaguing me for a long time and I""m not sure how to deal with it.   Should I confront the individual, or shoudl I let it pass.  I just don't know.   What I do know, however, is that someone is going to be hurt (emotionally) and I know that It wont be me this time. So I'm sort of stuck.  I guess I'll figure it out.   Things have a strange way of working out, and I know I won't be the one to fall here...at least not this time.   Anyway on a brighter note, work has been good....I love my job and what I do.  I just hope that there's more for me out there somewhere.   I'm going to find it someday, but for now life is good.  I can honestly say that.

"event","ok...so I thought I was irresponsible before...I guess I'm even more so now.  It's been way too long since I've written last, and as typical with most people's lives, things have happened.  Last time I wrote, I was juggling which job in the airline to take.  I chose the flight attendant position because, customer service never called...hmmmm...Anyway I went to training, and graduated as the most outstanding student in my class.  I liked training, and enjoyed flying my RJ even better.  It's strange how things work out I suppose and I don't quite know why they work the way they do....but now...I can't fly anymore because I have problem with my ears, and the constant change in pressure, from doing so many take-off's and landings has aggrivated it.  Little did I know but I've had the problem all my life.  Funny... eh well... Since I can't fly anymore, I have to transfer to a ground position, i.e., customer service.  I did all the necessary paperwork and I'm just waiting.  Anyhow, not much else has been going on, it was a nice new year, and things are going surprisingly well.  Theres still much left to be desired though, but I've been just going with the flow.  I'll try to keep better on this thing, that's what it's here for....anyway, I'm going to go now..Good Night.

"event","well I'm successfully irresponsible.  I haven't written in awhile, and I really have no excuse.  I took a quick jaunt home for a few days after a busy but positive week.  I interviewed for two airline jobs, which were flight attendant and customer service rep.  I was made an offer for flight attendant the very next day, which I accepted, but I am hoping that I'm made an offer for CSR too.  That would be cool, then I could pick.  I'm not really sure which one to take.  I flew in earlier today, and had a few things to take care of, and I'm finally winding down.  I did something different this time, I flew into HPN instead of LGA and that was kind of cool.  They changed that little airport a lot since I was there a long time ago, and it was nice.  I remember my dad took me there to see off my grandmother.  My mother met me in the terminal and we drove home.  It was really really nice.  I had a good time in New York...I was actually kind of sad to go home so soon, I should have stayed on a few extra days...but duty calls I suppose.  I'd like to go back soon, I hope that I can make it.  I'm scheduled to begin training for flight attendant on October 3rd, that should prove to be interesting.  I also went shopping today lol, from the Timberland Store downtown...I saw it last week and I talked myself out of it, but then the whole time I was home I was just like ""ahhh well, what the hell"" so I got it :) anyhow I'm kind of tired so I'm going to try to get some sleep.

"event","oh my what a day...I lost my wallet while doing some errands.  I had left it on a red line train coming back from Howard.  Of course I didn't really think anything of it, until I realized that I needed to check something and I needed my credit card number.  Now I had to cancel my hawaii trip because of some circumstances, and I had planned one to New Orleans yesterday.  I made reservations at a hotel, and at Emril's NOLA resturant...I had to cancel all of it, because I can't even get on a plane without and ID, and both my ID's were in there.  So I ended up cancelling my second trip.  After I did that, someone came to the door of the building saying that he was returning my wallet that he had found. I went downstairs to get it, and he explained to me that there were these people looking at it, and just left it.  So he picked it up...he wasn't sure that anything was taken.  I went through it, come to find out both my visa cards were missing as well as my CTA card....unfortunately for the ones who picked it up...one card is to an account that has been closed for 2 years, the other has 84 cents on it and is cancelled now, and the CTA card had 35 cents on it...oooh big haul for them....Jerks...tch...everything else was intact.  Thankfully. I really think I was not meant to go anywhere this weekend, to have two cancelled trips, someone didn't want me to fly...Anyway, I went bowling this evening and had a good time. I'm ok at it.  I may go back after 6 AM because it'll only be a dollar a game.  Well I suppose that's all in this chapter of my ever so exciting life. Yeah. Until next time. Buona notte.

"event","hi everyone.

    I feel good.  Wow, did I just say that?!?  Well I don't ask questions, might as well just go with it.  So like, I had a nice weekend.  I went to the Taste of Chicago on Friday evening.  It's a huge food festival....there's tons and tons of people, vendors and of course food! =^_^=...I got some ribs, and a piece of cheesecake.  They had a demonstration of Martial Arts for kids and they played one of my favorite Lee Jung Hyun songs.  I was dancing in the street making a spectacle of myself, and trying to sing the words except it's Korean.  Then on Saturday I spent the day downtown, the weather was great. I saw Lilo and Stitch, which was a great movie (I cried four times), went shopping at Nordstrom's, and then saw the Powerpuff Girls Movie.  All in all it was really nice.  Got back into the swing of things today, had breakfast with my friend P, and went to work at O'Hare.  I got an email from my friend Alexis, who I went to high school and that made me smile.  As I said I feel good.  By the way, just in case some of you don't know, my subject lines are lines from the Golden Girls.  I watch that show all the time, and I know complete episodes and witty quotes, and tend to just fire them off all the time.   Well everyone needs a hobby. :)  Anyway, that's about it for now.  Till next time.

"event","Hi. 

   Just made a Journal today, thanks to my friend Jon (however I won't disclose what I had to do to get him to let me) ::wink wink nudge nudge:: =^_^=.  Anyhow...I look forward to writing in this as often as possible. I think it's going to be a lot of fun. Anyway, there isn't really a lot going on today.  It's hot, the air conditioning finally works, but it's really old, so it's noisy and only has two settings freezing (literally) and off.  I guess I'd take freezing over passing out.  I've been online for most of the morning talking to the few friends I have, and catching up with them.  I moved to Chicago a few months ago from New York, so I left them behind.  I'll be visiting home soon, maybe after my Hawaii trip which is in two weeks from today.  As for the rest of today, I think I'll go out for a milk shake or something when it cools down a bit.  Other than that, I'll just stay in.  Wow I'm so exciting.  Yeah.

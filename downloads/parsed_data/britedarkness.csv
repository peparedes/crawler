"event","Man i saw star wars episode 3 and it was so Gangsta with a capital tight.  That was a while ago and i dont really write in this crap anymore so who cares. That was a G'd up movie tho.  It wraps up everything nicely too, except for 1thing.  I wonder how Chewie and Han hook up.  If anyone out theres knows how then leave me a comment, or just tell me how you think it happened.  Oh yeah and i saw Mr. and Mrs. Smith and that movie was tight too.  Especially when Angelina Jolie gets naked.  jk that doesnt happen.... unfortunately.  I dont want to spoil it but if u havent seen this movie you need to be put in a burlap sack and beaten with a stick. oh yeah by the way i graduated..no big deal though. jk...YES!!! im done with school. YES!

so whats happened since my last update? hmm...too much i think. lets see, Hawaii, like 2 concerts, Marine trumpet players ROCK, i won best senior award, or whatever its called, about time i get some recognition for my hard work.   I'm gonna miss being part of that band tho, oh well.  I got my hundred bucks to spend so maybe ill buy some music books and play for fun or something.   hmm ill probably never see most of u guys again.  i wonder if youll remember me.  anwyays thats about all i got to say so until next time, peace out.  Maybe ill update again when im 40 or something."

  wow its been so long since ive written in this thing.  Thats the same thing everyone else says when they havent written in their lj for a long time i guess.  Not much new except now im trumpet section leader so thats pretty cool.  The only thing that sucks is that everyone still thinks Richard is section leader cuz like there was no challenge or anything.  what happened was... during testing mr berry said me and richard got the same score, even though i really dont believe that.  but anyway, so the thing was he finish out 1st semester and we switch and i become section leader at second semester. what sucks is that we just made the switch like last week but nobody really noticed or anything.  oh well it doesnt really matter that much cuz i know i still rock like a meteor shower.  Second semester really sucks for me since i have to take two english classes.  The gay part is that were doing research papers in both of them at the same time.  oh well its my own fault anyway.  I hope someone else challenges this year so that i can get to be a judge for once... since the challenge Tuesday didnt work out...
hey maybe someone should challenge me.  yeah that would be cool, as long as i win. wait then i wouldnt be able to judge it.  so whats happened since the last time i updated... should i go month by month like everyone else does? alright well october was halloween november was thanksgiving december was christmas and katies birthday january i went to disneyland and honor band and february i got to almost judge a challenge.  all right thats about it so until next time, Peace out

"event","hello everyone, this is ericka =) 

i begged rob to let me update cuz i know he has some fans out there. and you wanna know what's going on in his life. hehe.

okay, so he got grounded the other day, and now he's not allowed to use the phone.. because, get this.. someone called him at 10:30 and it was a <b>Girl.</b> haha. i told him it was probably a booty call. but yea, he's not allowed to use the phone, but he CAN go online. =P. haha. anyway, things have been going on in his life. he's going back out with katie. i guess at first i was really mad about it. but you know, as long as he's happy i'm happy. i just hope nothing bad happens like it did last time. so congrats to him.

umm, on <strike>saturday</strike> sunday berto, cali, rob, and i went to Giovannis to eat pizza and play pool. The pool table was being used so we sat and played this game, egyptian something. i think it has to do with a rodent.. but yea, Rob beat us at that. its a pretty kool game. Also, Rob is tight as heck at pool, and we played teams, i was on Rob's team, so naturally, we won. =). i made the 8-ball in, so i was happy =). then the place didn't have change =\. so we left. haha i forgot to say that cali and rob were already at the place, so rob called me and told me that berto was coming to get me... and haha, berto came so we went to gios and when he was parking, he freaking hit the curb but it was like hella hitting the curb- so the rest of us made fun of him for off-roading.. =P after pool and pizza, we went to cali's house, which is always fun. rob hit me with the dart thingys from the blow gun =(. but anyway, the guys we're playing on Cali's trampoline- may it R.I.P cuz they freaking broke it! and also rob got hit in the face by berto's watch =( poor rob. but yea, after that we kinda just hung out, like we used to when impalla was here =(. then we came home. it was pretty fun.

sunday, lol idk what rob did, and i just asked him... he doesn't know either... it's the heat man.

OMG.

MissShinoda06: what did you do on sunday?
SkillmanRob: umm
SkillmanRob: what was sunday..
MissShinoda06: yesterday
MissShinoda06: haha
SkillmanRob: umm
SkillmanRob: i dunno
SkillmanRob: i dont even remember
MissShinoda06: were you just online?
MissShinoda06: wait.. did we go to gios yesterday?
MissShinoda06: i think we did
MissShinoda06: did we?
SkillmanRob: oh yeah

it MUST be the heat.. =\. LOL 

and today poor rob had to walk home in the 3248757602 degree heat. =(. and i think he might be sick. but anyway, he came home and like went to sleep on the floor, and his parents had people over. so thats pretty funny.. and yea, on his hand he had something that katie wrote, like katie <3s rob i think, and his mom saw it and she was like ""who wrote that?"" and yea i guess she got mad. idk. 

and right now, were freaking in a chat room that rob started.. and guess what its called ""Fantasy Room"" haha. he's a freak. and he's looking for someone to help him live out his fantasies. in his words, tie him up and have their way with him.. yea he's kinky like that. i told him he'll have a dungeon when he grows up.. hahaha he also wants someone to ""say his name"" if you know what i mean...

if you're interested, comment =P

im outta here =)

a bitch to paint the ceiling cuz u have to like look up the whole time 
and ur arms get tired after a while.  Then later i went to apollos 
house and ericka was there playing pool.  damn im good pool.  i want to 
be a pro someday and play in tournaments but i dunno if ill get that 
good. that would take some practice and me and practice dont mix.. BUT
pool is really tight so i wouldnt mind practicing now and then. i dunno.
i wonder if im gonna pass english.  i have to read a book tonight if i 
wanna pass.  hmm how much do i wanna pass.. oh yeah finals are coming

    damn so much stuff happened today.. i dunno where i should start...
hahaha yeah right u should know better than that.  nothing happened
today.  it kinda sucked a little.   well in band we did that scale crap
and i screwed up.  lol it was kinda funny cuz i didnt hit this one note
cuz i dont usually play that high but oh well doesnt really matter. i 
just hope i do better when we actually test.  nah but the really sucky
part about today was 5th period.  damn it was weird as hell.  we were
reading this book as a class then like right in the middle i feel all
dizzy and i feel like throwing up.  i had to stop reading and i put my 
head down.  i think i fell asleep or something but i dunno. i woke up
and i felt really cold and weak and my arms and legs ached.  my face
felt cold too.  damn it was weird.  i really wanted some water but i 
dont think i could get up right then cuz it was that bad seriously.  and
im not the kinda person too be like hey i dont feel good can i go to the
nurse? so i just sat there.  then it kinda went away but my stomach 
still hurt after that.  then after class was over i still felt weak and
walking was weird.  i think something is wrong with me.  oh well.  
anyways thats pretty much all the cool stuff.  so im out

King and The Last Samurai.  Is that how you spell that?  I dunno but 
anyways its almost time to go back to school.  I just got like the rest
of today but im gonna be asleep until about 2 o clock so there goes 
half the day.  Hmm what should i do on my last day before i go back to 
school.  Im prolly gonna go buy some shoes or something.  GUESS WHAT I

    man....school. What can i say, school sux.  but yeah one day its 
gonna be over.  I dont even remember if i had homework.  oh well too 
late now.  Im really not doing too good in my classes.  Especially
English.  I got an F in there.  I just havent been reading and thats
20% of the grade.  Yeah thats one thing i regret.  Theres something
else I regret doing and not too many people know about that so keep it
on the down low cuz its kinda stupid so if u dont know dont ask cuz i 
wont tell. but damn.... movies DO influence people... especially when
they are bored as hell doing nothing at all.
oh wait now theres 3 things lol.  well i dont really regret
this one.  Nevermind i dont even know what im talking about.  Its too 
late to be writing.. or too early depending on how u look at it.
 i think i should have went to bed early so i can adjust for when i go
back to school.  oh well.  ive been sitting here for like 15 minutes 
since the last sentence cuz i cant think of anything to write about.
oh yeah disneyland is coming up.  I think its like next saturday? I 
dunno im not too sure about these things. That should be fun i guess.

LOL today my mom was drinking and a little while ago she got
up to go to the bathroom and when she got out she went into 
my room, closed the door, and lied down on my bed. I was like
mom what are you doing in here.  And shes like oh im in the 
wrong room.  Man that was so hilarious. Yeah just had to write
it in here.  
    Anyways today my brother came over and i was like asleep 
and my nephew woke me up trying to get into my room to play
some winnie the pooh game on my ps2.   So yeah i let him play
it.  While he played it i got ready cuz they invited me to go 
eat with them and i was pretty hungry so i did.  I had a shrimp
cocktail...good stuff.  Then we went to some close friends house.
This is where the drinking started.  Dont worry I didnt do any
drinking..this time. jk.  but anyways my friend was like hey u
shoulda brought ur ps2 so i could school you at madden.  So i 
was like man ill kick ur ass.  So i asked my brother to take
me to go get my PS2 and come back but he was like already drinking.
So.. he gave me his freaken keys and told me to go get it myself.
I was like oh hell yeah.  So I did.  Good thing my dad wasnt 
looking out the window when i got there.  Then when i got back
to my friends house i came in with the PS2 and my mom was like 
how did he get here.  And my brother said he drove.  And she got 
al hysterical. lol not really but yeah.  doesnt matter... i dont 
think she remembers much of anything right now haha. So we started
playing Madden.  He beat me the first game by like a touchdown. 
Then i came back and beat him the second time by like 30 damn
points... he got schooled like a Harvard graduate. Yeah that was 
pretty much my day and i dont think u care but oh well. ok
PEACE OUT

"event","<pre><font face=""comic sans ms"" size=2 color=#E0E0E0>Whats up people?
     It sure has been a while since i last wrote in this thing.  As you probably
know, the reason for that is because I screwed up my computer.  Why you ask? I am 
stupid and i dont know.  I have never been more bored.  Everyday I would just get 
home and sit on the couch and watch tv.  Then id fall asleep, wake up, eat, then 
watch more tv until i fell asleep again.  Sometimes I didnt even watch tv cuz there
was nothing on.  Its pretty crazy some of the things you do when youre bored out of 
your mind.  But i'll spare you the details. Dont think you really wanna know anyway.
Anyways.. I finally got my computer back.  As soon as I got it I was like hell yeah
im gonna go online and everyone will be on and welcome me back.  But just my luck, 
nobody was on.  So i sat there waiting for people to come on.  It was then that I 
realized hey this is like the same crap I was doing without my computer.  Just 
sitting there doing nothing.  Oh well doesnt matter.  Now i get to fill my computer
up with useless crap like before.  No i think maybe this time ill think before I 
just go and download anything.  
     TWO WEEKS OFF!! Yeah I really needed it.  Now I dont have to wake up all early
everyday.  I can just sleep until like 2 in the afternoon.  So dont be calling my
house in the morning.  Not like anybody calls me anyways but im just saying. Yeah
now i can stay up all night on the computer doing nothing like i used to.  Like im
doing right now.  I forgot what it was like to be sitting here alone with nobody 
online to talk to.  Kinda like when I didnt have my computer.. kinda funny.
    My progress report came the other day.  Not like anybody cares but im writing 
this for me not for you so if u dont wanna read then screw yourself.  I got home and
my mom was watching tv and i saw the grades right next to her. Right away I was 
like oh great.  So what does she do?  If you know me well enough,  then you know 
pretty much what my grades are.  So you know I didnt get a pat on the back or 
anything like that.  Yeah i got yelled at.  I'm kinda used to it by now, but for 
some reason today it pissed me off more than usual.  All she does is yell at me and 
tell me how stupid and lazy I am for getting bad grades.  What the hell you think I
dont care at all? You think i want to have to go to summer school and night school
to make up classes?  No you stupid trick.  I'm the one that has to do it, not you.
""But Robert she does it because she cares about you"" Bullshit.  She just needs an 
excuse to go off on me.  If she gave a damn she would actually ask whats the matter
and why am i doing bad.  Not once has she ever said is there anything i can do to 
help.  Do you need to go to the library or something? She never tells me to do my 
homework.  And now when i get the grades shes all surprised.  What the hell did you
think was gonna happen? One of these days im gonna snap and go psycho or something.
It reminds me of my nephew.  Hes always been spoiled.  And now he does pretty much
anything.  And when he acts bad his parents are always like man I dont know why he
does these things.  I'll tell you why. Its because you've never encouraged him to do
any different.  SHIT.  
     Now on to a much tighter subject.  I watched Lord of the Rings: Return of the
King yesterday.  If I had to sum it up in a word, it would be tightkickassmovie.
Ok thats more than one word but i think you get the point.  The point im trying to
make is if you havent seen this movie go watch it.  NOW. Forget my LJ. Go watch it
now.  If you've seen the first two and liked them then go watch this shit. Thats 
about all i have to say about that.  OK I guess im gonna go sleep or something now.
PEACE

boring.  ok at first when i left his house on my way home i was like man what
am i gonna do without my computer? homework? never!  i was soooo bored
its not even funny.  when i got home i just laid on my bed and turned on the 
tv and fell asleep for a while.  then i ate and watched tv all day.  it was so
boring because i didnt even have anyone to talk to.  i had a lot of alone time.
i just walked around the house talking to myself lol.  not really having a 
conversation but stupid little things i dunno if u know what i mean but yeah.
my dad was at work and my mom out all the time so yeah i was pretty lonely.
but i got used to it i guess.  i got rid of my habit of getting straight on the computer
when i get home so something good came from this.  ok enough of that.  
  ive been getting really sleepy lately.  maybe its cuz i dont sleep enough.  yeah
that could be it.  oh the past couple of days my mom has been waking me up
early for some stupid reasons and sometimes for no reason at all.  ill be asleep
then at like 5 shell come and open my door and i wake up and she just leaves.
then i cant go back to sleep.  or shell bust in and be like is the phone in here?
but yeah i can never go back to sleep.  then i just lay there until my alarm goes
off then i take a shower and get ready and go to school and try to stay awake 
during class.  when im outside talking to people its ok but as soon as i stop
talking or get to my class and sit down thats when it starts.  my eyes just
start closing on me.  today i was falling asleep in 6th period.  not like i do any 
work in there anyway.  ericka was laughing at me so she thought it was funny 
i guess.  i prolly looked stupid trying to stay awake.  so i was like man screw it
and i went to sleep for a long time i think.  that and 5th period are when i 
catch up on my sleep.  maybe thats why im not doing so good in those classes.
ok ill write more some other time so peace

"event","<pre><font face=""comic sans ms"" color=#E0E0E0 size=2> yo what up people
       yeah im only writing in here cuz i had a tight/weird/cool/tight/tight dream 
last night and i thought i should write it in here cuz im cool.  Ok me and like a 
bunch of people were going to some theme park or something.  I dont remember
 what theme park it was but who cares thats not the point.   So we all had our 
tickets already kinda like when we go to disneyland with the band and they give
you those tickets.   So we got there and i didnt have mine cuz i lost it or something.
i was all pissed i forgot it and everyone was like should we go ahead or just leave.  
i didnt want to make them leave so i was like u guys just go ahead and ill see u 
inside.  so i went and walked around then i saw this wall so i climbed it.  But on the
other side there was this bigass drop, a little too high to jump off.  then there was 
this latter on the other end of this wall so i had to walk across the top edge of the 
wall  and balance like a g to get across. As i was walking across i saw some guy come
out a door down below and it was a security guard or something.  anyways he scared
the crap outta me when i saw him and i lost my balance and fell down the other side 
of the wall into a dumpster full of cotton or something soft like that.  Then i got out 
the dumpster and saw this door so i went in. now i dunno wtf happend cuz then right 
when i got inside it was like resident evil the game.  There were zombies up the ass
everywhere. (i dunno why they were there but they just were... i have a weird 
imagination) So i ran out another door on the other side of the room and all the 
people were out there.  I told them ""zombies!! get the hell outta here""  then the
zombies came out the door behind me and all the people thought they were workers
in costumes so they were like happy and taking pictures.  i was like noo u didnt theyre
real! but they all just laughed. yeah they laughed alright.. until the zombies started 
killing them.  after that i ran cuz that was some crazy shit. after running for a little 
i saw that same security guy. i told him what was up and of course he didnt believe me. 
so i picked up some pipe off the floor and knocked his ass out and took his gun. i said 
hey its better in my hands then it is in urs after they kill you..  then it was like devil
may cry cuz the gun had unlimited bullets.  i was killing zombies left and right.   but
then they started coming at me all at once.  i couldnt hold them off with just that 
pistol so i ran again.

   <i>to be continued</i>.... ill finish tomorrow</font></pre>"

  ok theres something thats been happening for a while now and im not sure what i should 
do about it.  OK.... everyone knows i love coke right?  i mean damn... coke coke coke coke
coke coke.  i dont know how else to say it except... coke is tight as hell.  you will usually 
see me walking around drinking a coke or just holding a coke because i always have one.  
 i dunno how to say this but umm ok.  im actually afraid to drink coke.  yeah thats right.. 
AFRAID.   well heres why.   for as long as i can remember i always drank coke.  now its 
like a drink coke like people breathe air.  but anyways.. for a while now ive been getting 
these pains every once in a while.   especially like after a  day a drank a lot of coke.  ok 
it tastes really good when  i drink it but then after i go to sleep... i wake up at like 2 or 3 
in the morning with stomach pains.  ok ive had stomach aches b4 and upset stomach and 
all that crap but this isnt like that.  it hurts so much.   like almost to the point where i dont
even wanna move because it hurts.  this has happened a lot of times already.  but i just keep
on drinking it because its so good.  but now i dunno.  i dont even know if its the coke thats 
doing it.  it could be anything else but yeah... i think its coke.  anyways.. what should i do 
about this.  today i got home and i opened the fridge and it was full of coke.   but when i 
looked at it all i could think about was that pain in my stomach.  and i really want one but 
i dunno if i should.  is it really worth the pain it gives me.. i dunno.  but yeah that shit hurts.
im wondering if its anything bad.  i hope not. i cant believe im afraid to drink a coke.  i have
like cokephobia.  damn you coke... you sweet, sweet coke.. why do u have to taste soo good..
yeah im scared now but i always get scared when the pain comes.  then i forget about it and 
start drinkin coke again until it happens.  hmm oh well.. time for a coke.  ok peace out


OH i made this a while ago so u guys can see where my coolness came from.

"event","<pre><font face=""comic sans ms"" color=#E0E0E0 size=2> Hello 
  at first i didnt want to update cuz im really lazy but then after a while i 
realized that i had nothing at all to do so yeah i might as well.  yeah i 
think everyone knows it was the first day of school today.  
  Ok before i say anything about today lemme just say that at spirit day
when i got my classes i had no sixth period.  even tho i already had signed
up for algebra 2.  so anyways i filled out another one of those damn papers
for a 6th period.  so i thought ok theyll fix it then when i go first day ill 
have a 6th and everything would be alright.  but then when i got to my first
period and they were handing out those white schedules i didnt get one.  so 
i was pissed cuz my old schedule only had 5 classes so even if they did fix it 
i wouldnt know what i have for 6th period.  so i asked mr johnson and hes 
like oh dont worry about it u might get it in your next class.  so i was like 
oh alright then ill get it next period. yeah but when i got there guess what?
yeah still no damn schedule.  so by now i was like damn i aint getting a 
schedule so i guess i dont go to 6th period.  then i heard on the intercom 
that if u filled one of those things out and they were fixing it then u should 
go to the cafeteria for that period.  so i went to the cafeteria.  omg it was 
sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
damn boring as hell.  i just sat there the whole time. i didnt know one person
there but yeah there was a lot of loners so i wasnt the only one. but yeah it 
was still so damn boring.  i sat there for an hour with nothing to do.  i was
so bored i would have done my homework if i had any.  if u dont know me that
well then ill just tell u it must be really boring for me to do my hw.  yeah so
anyways i was pretty pissed.  then i started to play tic tac toe with myself.  lol
it was kinda cool.  x kept on winning tho.  X won 3/4 games.  O you suck. then
i wrote like a letter to myself i think.  or maybe it wasnt even a letter it was 
just writing.  when the 7 minute bell rang i was like omg hell yeah im outta here
soon.  i would have taken off earlier if the damn proctor guy wasnt there.  so i 
finally got out.  i felt like i was getting out of jail or something.  then after i felt
all good to finally get out... it was time for band.  i didnt know we were gonna 
have practice so i didnt bring my other messed up shoes to march in.. oh well.
band was hot as hell or maybe i just thought it was hot.  i dunno but i was 
sweating out there.  it was fun kinda cuz me and richard and other guys were 
throwing someones water bottle up all high then trying to catch it.  oh yeah
the trumpets finally got boxes to stand on for when we play the fanfare in the
opener.  it kinda sucks tho because some people cant count and never get off the 
box at the right time and they make it look stupid.  and we got new music for the 
ballad.  a whole new world.  theres a trumpet solo in the beginning and its tight 
but of course david g gets to play it... oh well.  he plays good tho so its ok.  
hopefully one day he'll be absent and i can play it lol. 
  oh man when i got home the school called.  it was that damn stupid ass recording
they use when they call about an absence.  i was like wtf i went to every class.  i
guess i am in algebra 2 afterall.  but how am i supposed to know if i never got my
schedule u stupid mofos!?! yeah so i got mad. i wanted to call back and cuss em out
but nah i just explained it to my mom and told her so yeah shes gonna call and 
hopefully they excuse it.... they better. ok thats all.  
 laterz

  yeah well today i didnt do anything except for band.  i woke up at about 1
or something and i still felt sleepy.   i feel like the longer i sleep the more 
sleepy i am when i wake up then i end up falling back asleep.  yeah im weird.
oh i got my new trumpet the other day.   today was the first day i took it to
band to play it.  people were like oh damn its about time u got a new trumpet.
yup so im cool.  david G said he wants another trumpet too cuz he said hes had 
his for a long time.  yeah so today we actually started marching the show and 
playing too.  damn its crappy.  well only at first cuz mr b is wack.  anyways 
toward the end of practice it still looked kinda bad but it will get better i guess
by thursday. oh yeah theres that pot luck thing on thursday.  but instead its a 
bbg.  man its been that way since freshman year.  i wonder if they ever did a 
potluck.  yeah anyways im not going to it cuz i never do it.  david invited me 
to go like bowling or something so i think im gonna do that.  i havent been 
bowling in a long time so i guess it would be kinda fun. oh trumpets rock.  
yeah thats about it.  peace

  today was the first day of band camp. it was ok.  it would have been a lot better
if it wasnt so damn hot though.  apollo came to pick me up then we went to erickas
house for a while before band started   we kicked it in her room and we played counter
strike because its the tightest online game in the world and all who dont know about it
deserve to die a slow painful death.. (jk) anyways after that we went to go buy chips
because we had to take some so yeah.  then when we got there there was a little time
left before we started so i got to talk to some people i havent talked to in a while 
like marco eddie and enrique.  theyre pretty much the same except marco got darker.
oh yeah enrique and apollo are still white lol jk guys.  i dont feel like typing anymore
so ill make this short and sweet.  more short than sweet though..  mr berry made the 
annual speach and we did that one wack thing that i hate where u find people to fill
in this list of crap and yeah its wack so i wont explain it. for those of u who dont know
what im talking about... all u know need to know is it sucks.  then we went outside and 
worked on the easy marching stuff.  i was a little rusty at first but then it all came back.
its like riding a bike,  u dont forget.  then we took a break and then we went back out 
and did some other marching stuff thats a little harder like slides and stuff but im good
so it was ok.  yeah thats about it then we went home.  oh no wait we didnt go home.  
me and apollo went to pick up hos. lmao nah we didnt but i bet u thought we did.  we 
went to kmart to see if we could jack a CD key for counter strike so i can school 
apollo online.  but the box was like all taped and it was out in the open and im not 
daring enough to go for it.  im crazy, but not that crazy.  which is why we decided to 
go to plan B: bring cali next time.  lmao cali i hope ur up to it. so yeah OH YEAH i 
got some carls jr too.  ok thats it.  peace out  </pre>

  man i havent writte in this thing for such a long time... i wonder if anyone noticed? yeah well 
i havent done anything new.  or maybe i have but im just so used to saying i havent done anything?
nah i dont think so. im pretty sure everything is the same ol same ol...
 lets see if i remember anything... man i swear i dont remember crap.  i dont even remember what i 
did yesterday.  i can never remember things in order either.  i think ill just think of random stuff
and just tell u guys about it.. oh yeah! this is most recent.  i dunno if all u people who read this know
about my change cup.  like everytime i go somewhere with apollo and ericka (the posse) i always
bring the change home and put it in this cup.  oh btw, the cup is a coca cola cup too which is pretty
tight.  oh anyways today was one of those days when u get really bored.  man i couldnt believe it.  i
must have sat on the couch flippin through channels for an hour or 2.  i didnt even watch anything,
except for some music videos.  oh then i went to my bed to just kick it and watch tv in my room cuz
earlier i was in the living room. then i thought hey that change cup is pretty damn full.... so i decided
to count it just to see how ive been saving up my change.  so i sat there on my bed for a long ass time 
counting change.  i had more than 20 bucks in quarters.  34 in all.  the rest was nickels dimes and pennis.
not much pennies tho cuz i usually throw those out lol they take too long to count. so when i was done 
i was like hell yeah this is more than i thought it would be.  im thinking if i should cash it in or keep 
saving... hmm.  
  oh yeah band starts in like a couple days.  ok thats enough of band : P  lol jk.  but yeah man its all soon
over the summer sometimes when i got so bored i wanted band camp to start so it would give me 
something to do.  but now that its here im like aww damn it bands here already.  i got the paper in the 
mail today telling me about the band fee.  195 bucks.  is it just me or is the price going up every year?
damn.  i remember when it was like 130 or something and that was WITH shoes.  yeah those were the
good old days... freshman year.   i dont really know if the band is gonna be good this year, i guess ill 
have to wait and see.  oh but i do know one thing, the trumpets sure arent gonna be what they used to. 
theres gonna be like 3 of us that are good and thats if u consider me good.  david G richard and me.  yeah
thats not too many.  the other guys are good too i guess.  i dunno... like i said, ll have to wait and see.  
u never know,  maybe they practiced... right.  speaking of trumpets... i want a new one.   yup i think its 
about time i got one too.  but i dunno if my parents will come around.   
   oh yeah the online thing.  well the other day i connected to the internet and then some popup came
up and all this crap it said about something shutting down and it would restart my computer in a minute.
so everytime i connected i would get this countdown that would give me a minute then it would restart 
my computer.  i kept going on all day like an ass and i kept getting the same message.  i tried to close it 
but nothing worked.  then by the next day i had had enough of it so i tried to find a way to stop it.  i had 
to like hack my own computer to stop it tho.  yeah anyways and after that it didnt do it anymore.  so yeah
i was pretty proud of myself. go me.   think i should get a medal or something.  or money. lol yup...
ok thats about it.  i hope all this wasnt boring for you people who read it.  im out
peace

"event","<pre><font face=""comic sans ms"" size=2 color=red> Ok people
     since i got so many comments from people saying they read my stuff..i decided
to keep writing in here.  yeah and it kinda gives me something to do anyway.   and
besides,  i dont want u guys to miss out on some of the cool stories and things that 
happen to me.
    today was pretty cool.  i went with apollo and cali to go see tomb raider.  since 
we are cheap... we went to a gas station to go buy red vines instead of getting them 
at AMC.  hey theyre damn expensive at the movies! so i saved like 2 dollars cuz im
cool like that.  cali hid the red vines in his big ass pockets lol.  it was funny cuz u 
could hear the wrappers whenever he walked.  we bought sodas there even though
they were expensive cuz we didnt want to look that ghetto bringing in fountain 
drinks from a gas station lol. the movie was kinda cool but i feel like it could have 
been better.. and me and cali were crackin jokes the whole time so it was funny as 
hell.  i was laughing my ass off and i couldnt stop.  when i start laughing hard... u 
cant stop me.  oh yeah while me and apollo were getting the drinks and popcorn we 
saw enrique there.  i think he said he was with his aunt and uncle or something i 
dont remember.  but yeah he told me some pretty gay news. he said he was gonna 
move to mexico.  thats gay, enrique is pretty cool... well mostof the time anyway.
damn all the trumpets in band are moving!  damn, whos next? 
yeah so were gonna suck but thats ok im alright with that.  after the movie we 
walked in the mall to like a couple stores.  then we went to go eat at burger king.  
then apollo dropped cali off and then me.  when i was walking to my house my 
neighbor was like sitting on the floor playing with all her cats. it freaks me out 
sometimes.  that lady is weird.  it pisses me off shes always with her fucken cats.
shes like right there sitting on her porch and i know i saw her hosing it down earlier
cuz those cats prolly shitted all over it.  damn i hate her cats.  theres a million of 
those damn things.  so i get like to my house and i look and shes right there sitting
down and its prolly all still wet and like smelly and shit and shes playing with her cats
all in her face and talking to them like they understand her.  prolly has flees all over
her.  yeah its sick.  then i got inside and nobody was here... big surprise. (not really im
always alone) so here i am home alone once again.  bored as hell.  ok thats about all
that happened today.  i hope u enjoyed reading this and if not then ur gay.  ok
peace

up cuz i dunno if he would get mad.   Then after he left my mom was like why arent
you sleeping whats on your mind.  are you on drugs?  i was laughing my ass off when
she asked me if i was on drugs. LOL yeah this was a little while ago.  i told im just not
sleepy but i dunno if she believes me.  i hope she doesnt really think im no drugs or

"event","<pre><font face=""comic sans ms"" size=""2"" color=red>   hello
well..today was alright.
 At first i was asleep when ericka and apollo called and then they asked if i wanted to go 
somewhere so i said yeah because i have been kinda bored lately.  We went to go get in n
out and then we went back to eat it at apollos house.   When he changed a few channels we
saw that episode II  attack of the clones was on.  hell yeah!! so we watched that until it was 
over but it had already started so it wasnt that long.  It started like at the best part too.  The 
battle on Geonosis! i dunno if thats how u spell it but yeah that part kicks ass.  especially 
when mace windu (pimpest jedi ever... besides me) cuts off jango fetts head.  yeah it was cool.
i wasnt even paying attention to my burger cuz that part kicks so much ass.  so after that i 
remember i went on apollos computer to play counter strike.  damn that game is so freaken
cool. its hard because all the people that play on there are like freaken pros.. but yeah its still
fun even tho i just walk around until i die.  but yeah i got a little better after a while and i
actually killed some guys so that was cool.   then we went home at like 5 30.  right when i 
got here my mom was here cuz she was at our friends house helping them move in.  they are 
like moving back over here, i dunno why but yeah.  so i went over there and i helped them too. 
lol then the funniest shit happened.   ok back in the day when i used to be over with them a lot
we went to tj and we brought back all these M80s. its like a whole bag full.  so yeah theyve had 
those for a while.  so when we were like taking a break he pulled out the bag and was like hey 
remember these?  lol it was tight.  so there we were. there was 4 of us : manuel franky angel
and me.  manuels the youngest, then franky and then angel is the oldest.  so anyways angel got
one and we went outside.  manuel stayed inside tho i guess he didnt want to get caught or something..
so we were right there in the backyard and franky was like hey lets dig a hole and put some in there. 
lol so he was digging the hole and i was watching and angel was the one holding the M80 and the 
lighter.  ok me and franky were talking when i heard angel laugh and run.  we were like wtf?  then 
franky started running so i turned around (like a dumbass cuz the M80 was to my back) and when i 
turned around i saw it explode like right there in front of me.  i was soo fucken close!! i could feel 
impact like on my body.  it was crazy.  that was like the loudest one ever.   i think i was like ahh 
shit and then we ran inside.  but there were all these people around thats why i didnt think angel
would do it yet.  so then all these people were like it was them.  then the manager came and we 
were like ahh fuck!  so him and his wife were like everybodys saying it came from you.  and we 
were like umm.  then she kept talking and i went around to the back of the house and i took off 
and went inside with manuel.  lol.  so yeah we were hiding in there.  youre prolly thinking man u 
guys are some pansies but nah i didnt do anything so theres no damn way im gonna get in trouble.
 so we heard them talking outside and angel was like on the roof and hes like uhh i dropped something
from up here.  i was like what the fuck u think theyre gonna believe that shit!!?it was sooo hilarious. 
but yeah they left and then franky and angel came inside.  man i dunno whats gonna happen. hope 
they dont get kicked out or anything cuz they just got here.  so yeah i dunno.  oh and then theyre
mom got PISSED OFF!! lol and she took the rest of the M80s away. lol sucks for them.  then later 
i went home. ok thats about it.  peace out </font></pre>"

"event","<pre><font face=""comic sans ms"" size=2 color=red> hey peoples
   well im pretty damn bored since i dont do anything so i think ill just talk
about people this year.  and maybe some stuff i remember too. 
   well... when this year started i dont think i really knew that much people. 
i thought it was gonna be just the same old people as last year.  then i was 
kinda excited cuz i remembered that i would get to see people from DeAnza
that i never really talked to and other people that i did talk to but i havent 
seen then in like a year.  Some of them havent changed at all.  They are 
like almost exactly how i remember them.  (Enrique) lol jk jk.  I remember
i never really talked to ericka much in middle school but this year me and her
became really good friends.  Oh and i guess i kinda met some new people too.
I remember last year i never talked to Apollo.  I only knew him as that one 
guy in the room next to me when we went on tour to San Diego.   But this
year i talked to him a lot and we became pretty good friends too.  I remember
when i first walked into first period mr williams class and i was like damn i dont 
know anybody.  then i ended up sitting next to apollo cuz of his name.  (DelSol)
yeah thats kinda close to my name so yeah.  im pretty sure thats how we started
talking.  Apollos pretty cool.  U know we always mess with u and stuff apollo but 
u can take it and u dont like take it up the ass and thats whats cool about you. 
Hmm... what about me guys. What kind of friend am i.  am i good one or not so
good. have i been a good friend to everyone. im just wondering what kind of person
people consider me.  alright im outta here.  later </font></pre>"

yeah i guess thats why my grades suck but oh well.  yeah its time to get to 
the mail b4 my mom does so i can get the report card.  damn shess gonna be 
pretty mad but oh well.  ill just sit there and let her scream at me and all 
that until shes finished. whatever.  i kinda want to go to raging waters 
this summer, or the beach, or six flags, or whatever.  ill just wait and see
what happens. 
ok i guess ill talk about today.  after school i went with apollo and ericka
to eat at bakers.  then after that we went to nickel nickel. we kinda go there
a lot now but its cool i guess.  i just kinda wish they would get some more
games cuz i have played like all the good ones that are there!  now when we go 
we always play the same games.  and ericka always plays crazy taxi.  then after
that we came back to apollos house and here we are.  they are having a great 
time playing DDR and i am right here bored as hell but its ok.  yup... i think

"event","<font face=""comic sans ms"" size=2 color=red> im at calis house right now and i just decided to update.
today was kinda tight but only because it was really short.  we got out at 12 so that was pretty cool.  but the only thing gay about it was the finals.  i had to take my geometry final today.  that was kinda easy because it was only 20 questions.  i know i got one wrong but thats because the answer was like something that she didnt show u how to do. i knew howto do it but i didnt think she was gonna make it right so i didnt put that.  but whatever i missed one.  the only thing that sucks about a short test is that if u miss a little bit that messes up the percentage.  so since i missed one i have a 95. but i know i missed more than one so i probably have a really low grade.  but oh well i dont care.  i have a B in that class now.  then after that i had to take my english final. i hated that because it had questions about books they read in first semester so i didnt know what the hell they were talking about. i got a bad grade on that but its ok because im failing that class anyway... yup.  oh yeah when i got home after school i was locked out of my house.. lol.  yeah and i had to wait a while until my mom got home. yeah then i got here at calis house somehow.  ok thats about it so im out of here.

    yeah i went to the park today.  but i guess you knew that already if u read my last
entry.  it was fun.  as soon as i got there they had like food.  i was pretty hungry cuz i 
didnt eat anything all day.  so i ate all this chicken and other stuff.  then me and my 
friend and his brother played soccer for a while.  then we put up the volleyball net 
and after everyone got there we started playing volleyball.  at first it was like not cool
and everyone sucked cuz we havent played in a long time. but after a while we started 
playing good and it was tight.  we played like all day and i got freaken tired! but it was
fun though.  then it was starting to get dark so we stopped playing and then we just 
sat around for a while and everyone was like talking and stuff.  ok then my brothers wife
was talking about her little cousin or something.  i dunno exaclty who she was.  but yeah 
shes like hey shes about your age.  so i  was like umm really.. thats cool.  and then shes
asking if i think shes pretty and i was like um yeah sure.  and then she was like ok im 
gonna hook u up. i was like whoa no.  yeah it was pretty funny though.  she was actually
pretty but nah..  then people started going home so we all left.  and i got home and here

"event","<pre><font face=""comic sans ms"" size=""2"" color=red>hey everyone
   well well well.. havent written here in a while.  As you all probably know already...
school is actually coming to an end.   It felt like this time would never come.   This 
year was just so long for me.   I just wanted it to be over.  This year hasnt been that
great at all.  i did horrible in school.  i dunno why though.  its not like i had anything 
better to do than homework.  i just never really got around to it.  Procrastination is  
my way of life i guess.  or maybe i was just like distracted... i dunno.  its just that there
are some things that were always on my mind.  some of them still are.  whenever i try
to do anything or think about something else it like all leads back to one thing.  i just 
cant concentrate on anything else.  or maybe im just lazy.  either way... i suck.  but 
oh well u know.  2 late now.  the year is over.  all thats left is finals.   i wonder what 
im gonna do this summer.  probably nothing.  i kinda just want to go to my brothers
or sisters house and just stay there.  sometimes when im with them i forgot about all
of the stuff that bothers me. well... most of it.  havent seen my brother in a while.  i 
remember a long time ago.  we used to do all this crap together.  even now when i see
him its like really cool.  i think like everyone acts a certain way depending on who your
with.  but like when im with him it doesnt matter.  its just... cool.  his wifes cool too.  
its like hilarious when im with them.  since theyre not like old yet.. they talk about some
pretty funny shit sometimes.  hmm i kinda want to go to six flags too.  i havent been 
there in  a long ass time and they got like new rides now so it would be cool to go.  
aybe my sister will go or somebody then i can go with them.  rollercoasters are so tight.  
i dont even remember the last time i went there... ummm i dunno probably like a year or
2 im not that sure.  ok what  do i talk about now.... um ok i told you what i want to do. 
now ill tell you what i will probably end up doing.  ok here it goes....there.. did u get all
that?  yeah ill prolly end up doing nada. sitting around all day watching tv and playing 
calis dreamcast and my ps2.  oh well thats not too bad.  oh yeah and ill be online 
sometimes to update.  well i wont really need to update this for a while cause it will just 
be like "" hey guys i woke up today ate watched tv played video games and went online""
lol.  ok it wont be that boring but im just saying.  oh yeah im going to the park 2morrow 
with my family and other people.  why... i dont know.  but im probably gonna like play 
soccer or volleyball.  its pretty fun.  and im like the best at volleyball so its cool.  
alright i got nothing else to say so im outta here.  PEACE

"event","<pre><font face=""comic sans ms"" size=""2"" color=red> Hey People
      in case you havent noticed..i havent updated in here for a while.  and its
because i went to florida.  i kinda forgot to mention that but yeah most of you 
probably know that already.  and i just thought i should come on here and tell
you about it.   
     ok i guess ill start with how i got there.  apollo took me home after school 
so i could go get my stuff cuz i didnt bring it in the morning because im way 
too lazy 4 that.  then he dropped me and ericka off at the school.   well not 
really because he waited there for a long time.  i think until the busses left but
im not sure.  oh and he let me take is gameboy.  in the bus on the way to LAX
i sat next to cali i think.  i cant remember if i went to sleep or not though..
anyways, after we got there we had to get our tickets and get our bags checked 
and that kinda took a long time.  then we had some time before the flight so i 
just walked around and look in some of the stores and sat down for a while. oh
i forgot to mention that this was my first time getting on a plane so it was kinda
weird at first.  i sat next to nohemy and andrew but i dont really talk to them so 
i was really bored on the plane.  the movie was boring so i fell asleep but it was
uncomfortable.  i really dont feel like typing that much but oh well i already 
started so i cant stop now but like nobody reads this thing anyways so i dunno..
ok i guess ill just keep going.  ok ill just say the stuff i did cuz i dont really 
remember the order of anything.  
mgm studios:  went here with david tademy the first time but it wasnt that cool
because we didnt go on any rides because he didnt feel like it and i didnt want
to go on anything by myself.   we left pretty fast.  the second time i went was 
with ericka, diana, richard, ike, joe and david.  that time was more fun because
we went on tower of terror and i liked it a lot and we went on the roller coaster 
and i thought that was pretty cool too.  i dont think david wanted to go on it at 
first but when it was over he sounded like he liked it so maybe we changed his 
mind about roller coasters.  
magic kingdom:  this place was kinda like the disneyland here in cali except 
that some of the stuff wasnt in the same place and it looked a lot nicer and they
didnt have some rides but they had more of other stuff so i dunno. i was here 
with the same people as above cuz me and david were about to leave but then
we saw them on our way out so we hung out with them after that.  we went on 
rides and went shopping and stuff and we went on space mountain and splash
mountain.  lol we had this tight pose on splash mountain but my eyes were like
closed but its ok cuz it still looked tight.  ericka bought a picture of us on tower 
of terror too and that one was funny because everyone was acting scared and im 
just like right there like if im watching tv or something.  lol.  oh we went to this 
arcade too and that was pretty tight cuz me and ericka started playing DDR
and we kept playing for a long time and all these people came to watch us and
they were looking at us so it was cool.  and then they were like asking me how 
to play and how we got so good at it.  i remember i used to watch people and be 
like dang that looks hard i could never do that. but im kinda good now.  
epcot:  when we had our concert there it was soooooo hot.. i was like dying out 
there.   then when we came back the second time it was ok.  we went to go look 
at fish and this dolphin.  i fell asleep in there cuz i was sleepy.
animal kingdom: ZZZzzzzZZZZzzzzzZZZZzzzz  
other stuff:  the resort was pretty cool.  brandon, martinez, and cali were in my 
room.  damn we hardly got sleep on tour.  ok we got back to our rooms at like
12 everyday  and lights out was at 1 but nobody went to sleep at that time.  we
stayed up all late and we always had to wake up early the next day. especially 
when me and cali had to go to the kennedy space center.  we had to wake up
soo early and david and brandon kept getting all these calls and they kept 
waking me up so i was pissed.  
the ride back was pretty much the same thing as on the way there except i sat
next to ericka on the plane and i didnt fall asleep that time and the movie was 
tight.
alright i cant think of other stuff cuz im still sleepy so i think imma go to sleep 
or something.
PEACE

  it has come to my attention that a certain someone who shall remain nameless
(flaminghomodavid) has been telling people that i smoke or i always carry a pipe 
with me or whatever.  So i just wanted to say that its not true. I have never done
anything like that in my life and i probably never will.  So if he says anything else 
like that again then dont believe it.  but then maybe u dont believe me.  its your 
choice.
thanks ericka.

-Rob (non smoker)

p.s.  even if i did decide to smoke one day (which i never will) how could i?  i 
wouldnt have any time.  i spend too much online. lol.

Today was alright..
    it started out like any other friday.  but when i got to first period i looked
around and i realized that like nobody was there.  i think about half of the class
didnt go to school.  it was like that in all my classes though.  then in band we 
were practicing for our pops concert today.  that went alright.  except im kinda
pissed because they made me buy a mute and we only use it for a couple of 
measures so that was a waste.  
   after school apollo didnt have his car so we had to walk.  but then rosa and chris
picked us up so we didnt have to walk so that was cool.  so yeah i was at home 
until it was time to get ready for the concert.  since we didnt perform in the first
half, me and apollo went to go watch the concert and we sat in the back by the 
doors like thugs. lol.  my mom and my brother and his wife and my nephew went.
i dont think i look anything like my brother.  you cant even tell we are related. at
least thats what i think.  my mom told me to leave as soon as it was over because 
my brother wanted to go somewhere to eat with us.  so when it was over i went 
outside to wait for them but they werent there.  then my mom comes waking up
and shes all mad saying she was waiting for me on the other side.  i was like umm 
why would i go that way?  i never go that way.  so im trying to eplain it to her 
but its too late cuz shes already mad.   i think so far after EVERY performance
we had  my mom has found some way to get pissed off at me.  every time shes 
mad. it pisses me off so much.   so she tells me to go run to the other side and get 
them cuz they are waiting for me over there.  but i didnt run, its not my fault she
told them to wait.  then wehen we got to them my mom is like acting all happy 
around them.  i dont know about her sometimes.   shes mad at me one second 
and then the next shes expects me to be all happy.  no mom im not like that.  
if u piss me off then too bad.. im pissed and theres nothing u can do about it.  
oh yeah i gave her my clothes to change in after the concert so i wouldnt have 
to be like all dressed.  i told her to bring them with her when she came with my 
brother.  then when she gave them to me the wallet was there and she forgot to 
get my shoes.  so i was kinda mad cuz i thought she lost my wallet. so when i was 
in the house and i got my shoes i came back to the car and they are all looking 
through my wallet.  wtf people its MY wallet.  so yeah they found pictures and 
they found this one of briza and they are like who is this.  and im like thats briza.  
and my brother and his wife are like "" i think shes pretty""  and i was like oh yeah?
me too. lol.  it was funny.  so yeah after we got to this one place to eat i wasnt 
mad anymore.  that was kinda fun except andrew fell asleep so i couldnt like mess
around with him or anything so it got kinda boring and i got a little sleepy.  but 
after that they brought us home and here i am.  
alright thats about it.  bye

"event","<pre><font size=2 face=""comic sans ms"" color=red> hey people, 
   today.... well what is there to say about today.  all i can think of is one word.
gayestdayofmylifeitlastedforeverfuckenkillmenow.  yeah thats it.  as usual it 
all started with school. school was gay especially for 3rd and 6th period because
i had tests and im sure i screwed those up bad.  
   after school... damn.   ok so apollo stayed for erickas practice because he always
does so i do too because hes my ride home so yeah i stay cuz im too damn lazy
to walk.  so we were in the band room first, then we went to the auditorium for 
like an hour.  if i didnt spell that right dont say anything cuz ill kill you and i 
dont care.  and if i spelled it right then forget the last sentence.  so anyways..
the practice was.. in one word... horrible.   nah not horrible im just playing but
a couple of those songs... wow.  and i dont mean that in a good way. all i have to 
say is damn... i use to LOVE star wars songs,  but after hearing that... damn. 
but i shouldnt say anything cuz at least they tried out and theyre performing and
what the hell am i doing. not a damn thing.  then after that they were gonna go
through the whole thing a second time so i was like omg no i cant sit through all
this again.  we waited like a couple songs then we got the hell out of there. 
then we were in the band room again cuz apollo said he had to do homework so 
i was just sitting there daydreaming and wondering if my mom found the (umm
stuff) that i left in my room somewhere.  oh hey by the way for those of u who
know what im talking about.. when i got home right now i found it right here on
my desk.. out in the open.  slap me.  ok back to after school.  so we were in the 
band room waiting for ericka and then she came and yeah apollo thought we 
were leaving but i knew better.. it wasnt like 6 yet so i knew there was no way we
were going home yet.  damn i dont even remember what happened after that.
oh yeah ericka went to go see a teacher or some crap. so yeah that was gonna take 
a while. so i went outside and me and eddie were throwing this tennis ball around.
that was kinda fun for a while i guess.  then we went to sit in apollos car for a long 
ass time.  after that i dont remember much except later... MUCH later.. ericka 
told apollo to go get food for her and somebody else. and eddie wanted food too 
and a ride home.  
   first we went to weinerckgfgisap and me and eddie got food.  omg that took so 
damn long!! aHHHH  then we went to in n out cuz thats where ericka and some  
girl wanted food from.  that drive thru took forever too.  DAMN IT soooo long
i was pissed.  we got their food after like an hour and by then me and eddie were
done with our food.  and im not gonna say what eddie did but shit... fucken eddie.
lmao. so right after we dropped him off at his house.. we made like two turns 
then erickas stupid soda fell. it got all on my shirt.  i was like FUCK. and i threw
her cup out the window.  so of course apollo wanted to get her another soda.  
and hes like broke all the time.. so i had to use my cup from weinerheiehgkdgj to
get her a refill.  so we got it then we were driving and it almost fell again.  that
was funny though. we were cracking up.  i thought apollo was gonna crash or 
something. we got to the shool and it was all late so i thought eveyone had left
cuz i thought man... who would be here at 7 PM.  but then i thought hey... its
ericka.  so apollo went to the choir room to take the food and he didnt see anyone 
and he was coming back and hes like "" nobodys there"" so i was like OMG i know 
we didnt go buy food for nothing. then claudia came out and told us they were 
in the hallway.  so i got out with my shirt that was wet from the ass, and we 
went in the hallway and there they were.  then after standing there for a little
while we finally went home.  i got home at like 7 something.  thats gotta be a 
record.  and right now apollos dad just came to my house saying apollo hasnt 
been home yet and ericka either.. so apollo take your ass home.  u guys better 
not have done anything stupid..
L8erz

"event","<pre><font size=2 face=""comic sans ms"" color=red>  hello
   today was not very cool.   in fact, it was pretty gay.   but then most of my days are crappy so i 
dunno.  in first period i was taking that science part of the testing and it was kinda hard.  theres 
some shit on there that i dont know.   and if i dont know it... then he prolly didnt teach it to us 
cuz i dont just forget stuff like that.  and i kept daydreaming so i finished all late. then in second 
period i was like hell yeah im gonna play football.. but NO mr davis is too gay for that so we went
in the weight room.  i guess we are doing weightlifting now.  i dunno though i wasnt really paying 
attention.  lol.  but the gayest part of today was definitely forth period.   mr berry.. i dunno.  ok i 
was like talking i guess or laughing or something and he calls me and im like damn what is it this 
time.  i swear.. that guy calls me like everyday.   so he calls me and tells me to stay after class. 
man i was pissed.  he always fucken calls me! im not the only one talking you bastard.  and even 
if i am talking its because that queer david says something first or he makes me laugh.  its always
his damn fault.  im gonna jump that fool  if this happens again.  how come mr queer doesnt call 
him too im not the only one talking damn it.  i dont talk to myself. well... not in class.   so yeah 
i went after class and it was gay because he talked to like everyone in the room before me even 
though i was standing right there next to him.  josiahs like on the other side of the damn room and
hes like what can i do for you josiah.  and my name is not mr cobian bitch its robert. ROBERT!!!
but he calls me that cuz he knows im tight.  so after about an hour.. he talks to me and says all this
crap about me not behaving and stuff.  i dunno i was just standing there waiting for it to be over. 
then hes like you have a lot of talent but u need to stop talking.  yes im talented.  but yeah i guess
i do need to stop talking in there.  but its that queer davids fault though.   
  ok on to another topic.  there was at least one cool thing that happened today. lol some guy carlos
is gonna pay me 5 bucks to do this make up test for him.  its like an old test and its easy so yeah 
thats a quick 5.  hell yeah im 5 dollars richer! thats like.. a burger but yeah still cool.  
  aight thats all i gotta say and its kinda late and im getting tired so im out
PEACE

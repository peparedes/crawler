"event","so i have lost 10lbs. but i want to lose another 30. I work out a lot, but i do not have good eating habits and i am reaching a plateau. I am going to go back on the plan. I am going to post everyday to make sure i stick to eating healthy and continue to work out. I just want to look great for my boyfriends prom and this summer and for myself. I hate the fact that my thighs are big and my stomach sticks out. Its awful. I want to be a skinny little thing. Delicate. I hate being bigger. I am just not happy with myself. Also in 2 weeks I am going to see my mom and she always gets on me about my weight cause she is a size zero and therefore everyone is unhappy if they are a size or two bigger. ... ugh."

"event","I have been disgusting lately. I can't believe it. I feel like a cow. and to top it all off my boyfriend and i only talked for 5 mins tonight because he ""had a lot on his mind"" and just wanted to lay in bed and think about stuff... what the fuck is that supposed to mean!? he sent me this wonderful email about how much he misses me and loves me and how he loves that I am in his life and how I inspire him and then he goes and he says...i need to think about stuff. It made me want to cry, but i cannot. because everyone is in my fucking dorm room right now. Sean is studying with shanna for their psyc test and fucking hatchet face is in here too doing her work. I just want to curl up in bed and go to sleep, but i can't when there are a million people in my room doign work when they shouldn't even be here. I don't want them to. I want to go home. I want to go home and see tom. I love him and i just want to be in his arms and nap. LOok up into his smiling face and just forget the world. And I want to see my sister and my mom. I really want to see my mom. I am going to see her next weekend for the first time in 2 months. I am going to starve myself all week because I don't want her to say I look fat. I would die. I am just going to starve myself allll week long and be soooo skinny. I can't wait. LIke actually. I am going to be a size two. it is my goal. I want to be one of those small little girls. With beautiful legs and a flat stomach. And I will go and see tom and i will be skinny. and he will love me more. 
I just feel so broken down. I feel like I am being beaten while I am down. I want to go to bed. All I want is to sleep. I feel miserable. Absolutely miserable adn I hate it. I just want to go to sleep. I want to sleep forever. I feel like I am in a nightmare. MAybe this is just one of those moments and tomorrow will be better, but its almost tomorrow and i don't think that my life is going to get better in 13 minutes. I just wish I could disappear sometimes. I almost wish I had a single so I could lock myself away and not eat for days. I don't even want to make an appearance. I just want to be there and away from the world. I want to forget it all. ALl the bullshit and all of the fake friendships I have here. And when i come back out I want to be skinny adn beautiful. 

THe truth is, I feel so lost without family. I need them. As crazy as they are adn as annoying as my grandma is to live with sometimes, I love them. I love them more than anything else in my life and I just want to be closer to them. But I am in an amazing program here, which makes me want to stay. Then there is tom who is going away next year and he isn't going to come here. I know he isn't and it kills me. I just love him with all of my heart and I want to be close to him. Very close to him. I want to spend my life with him and I can't function without him. I know I love him too much. It affects me. A love so strong that it is painful sometimes. He is my light, he is my inspiration and he is the person who I want to grow old with. This sucks. I hate feeling this way. I feel sick. I want to see my sister grow up and I want to just settle into a life already. I am sick of school. I am sick of being away from the people I love. I miss my best friends, who I don't talk to as much as I should. It makes me feel guilty. They are so much closer now and Eric and I barely ever talk anymore. I don't know what to do. I am going to cry adn scream and shout. God FUCK THIS! I CAN""T TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE!"

"event","Today was just one of those days. I feel out of control and I didn't study like i should have for my tests. I am   not as prepared as i could be and i have to wake up early tomorrow and STUDY! FUCK! Ugh, then there was the boyfriend, who called me tonight all sad. He finally realized that next year he is not going to be at home anymore. he is going to college and he is going to be far away from me (most likely) I hope he goes to school in maryland, but its probably not going to happen... even though he is applying to three schools there. Ugh, i am just in a bad mood now. If he goes far away and then breaks up with me I don't know what I will do. ...no i do know. I am going to go back to my old ways of not giving a fuck about everything and not eating. (well, at least that part would be good) I know that he doesn't want to break up with me adn I don't want to break him, but i just want him to be close. If he were to go down to Tulane, or go to Pitt or Carnegie Melon.. I just...I would be miserable. It would tkae so long to get to him which means that I would see him less. And I am already seeing him much less that usual. It hurts me. I really feel empty inside when I am without him. I love this boy more than anything else in the entire world and I want to spend my life with him. I just wish he were applying here, but he isn't. He isn't even doing it, which i suppose is a good idea, because were he to get in, which he would, i woudl want him to come ehre and pester him about it and we would fight and it just wouldn't be good... Ugh, I want to go to bed. I just...today has not been fun. I want to wake up tomorrow and new and better day. Until tomorrow."

"event","Today feels so dreary. i didn't wake up to go to my piano class. i just wasn't in the mood. plus we get to free misses from that class anyway... But here i am with a pile of work and I am on the computer adn eating a yogurt.. I didn't want to eat it but yesterday when i waited all day to eat i had such a bad headache and it put me in a bad mood. So i think that i am going to have a yogurt during the day just to keep that nasty feeling away. Last night I worked out and it hurt sooo bad. My abs are killing me, but i cannot wait to do it again. I did 300 sit ups two nights in a row and 30 push ups each night. leg lifts, squats, and some other exercises that i don't really know what to call them and stretches. My stomach is already looking flatter from the lack of food and all of the activity. 
oh and i spoke to my TA and i am getting help in theory. It makes me feel so much better because I really do not want to fail it and I don't want to do poorly. I at least want to get a B. I think that I can still do it if i work really really hard. And I think if my professor see's how hard I am pushing myself to get this grade he will help me out with my grade. He has talked about it with the class becuase a lot of people did poorly on the last test. I just feel bad because when he gave all of us a second chance i messed something up and it was such a stupid mistake. Its like i cannot win, but I will. I will get a B in the class. I will do much much better becuase I know that I can. I am better than this and I always have been. I really want to be an A student. i want to have a kickass GPA becuase when I get out of college I want a good job. I want a great job actually and I want to get my masters at the school of my choice. I want ot be able to come out of this and have a grad school want me. That way I can be a teacher who makes a somewhat decent living instead of the shit that most teachers get paid...But i can worry about that in 4 years. 
OH i almost forgot! I talked to my mom today and for ym bday I am going to get a puppy!! and next year move into a house where I can live with him too! I can train him all summer and then he will be somewhat ready to adjust to a new place and I can finally have my own dog. I really really love dogs and I can walk him all the time which will make me nice and fit and play with him when it snows...omg it is going to make me soooo happy. I love it! i have wanted it for so long adn finally it is going to work. This puppy is just going to inspire me to do even better and push myself harder so that I can a) get him and b) create a really good home for him. Yay! 

well, I am off to do a mountain of work to distract myself from food...maybe i will even go practice my pieces for rep class. I have to sing in three weeks and yeah, it will be ready, but I want them to be perfect. I want my studio to really like me and I hope that by really trying hard I can impress them, but not in a ""i'm better than you"" sort of way. They are really nice people anyway and I don't think it will be an issue. 

okay, until tomorrow...or maybe later tonight!"

"event","Day 1-??-9

F: 2/2 - didn't eat all day until dinner and only ate a salad and 4 triangles of small pita and hummus. 
W: 1/2
E: 2/2
P: 2/2
S: 2/2 

Good first day back on the plan. The water is hard because being at college means i can't refill my water bottle all the time (some places the water is just nasty) and since i am poor i can't buy a new on every 5 seconds... but besides that i think i am going to do really well. I can't wait to go home in two weeks and weigh myself. I know there is going to be a big difference. Also, i want to go on a fast, but i don't what kind i should go on. 

Anyway, today was crazy. I hate mondays because they are my busiest day....not to mention that i have five hours of singing which kills my voice. And i am doing so badly in my harmony/theory class. I am failling right now becuase I just suck at it. and no matter what i do.. i just can't get ahead. I have gone to my professor, my friends who actually get it adn now the TA. It's like I can't get ahead and I feel so out of control with it. Today we had a pop quiz and I know that I just flat out failed. Ugh, why is this my life!? 

I think in a couple days, once i get my stomach down to a smaller size i am going to fast for 3 days. I want to fast so I can prove to myself that I really can do this adn that way It can boost me to eat less and less everyday because I got through 3 days of fasting. The only thing is..it is going to be hard with my roommate around. I feel like she will notice and I need to have good lies ready for her. Ugh, okay i need to go do an insane amount of work before i can go to sleep. 
Until tomorrow."

"event","I feel disgusting. I thought that I would come to college and just be able to have fun and find friends easily and lose weight because my parents aren't breathing down my neck to eat all the time. But all my friends eat so much and they stay sooo skinny. I stopped going to the gym too, which tomorrow is changing. I am going to go work my ass off. And I can't wait to eat very few calories. I hate the people i am friends with here. Except one girl. She is like a mom. But besides that...it is awful. I miss my best friends. They are so far away. And my boyfriend is still back at home. Finnishing up high school and applying to colleges. Colleges that aren't mine. It makes me sad. BUt i love him. He makes me so happy and I have never loved anyone like this. I am usually a girl who can't stay tied down to one person, but here I am 5 and a half months into this and I want to keep going. i want to hit a year and I want to hit 3 years. I just.. he is everything to me and I think I am everything to him. I mean...he bought me a diamond necklace for my birthday and we had only been dating for three months.. I think that constitutes some strong feelings. God, I just wish that I could look better for him. Be skinnier than this. I want to be beautiful. I want to feel beautiful. I am definately starting the 28 day plan and I am going to do it. I am going to beat it. I am going to be perfect. I just can't wait. And I am going to do so fucking well in school. I want to get a 3.5 or higher. I don't think I will, but if I try extra hard, maybe I can. I want to do it and I want to do it well. No more stupid mistakes like in highschool. 

I can't wait to weigh 120. I can't wait to be teeny and i can't wait for my boyfriend to be able to just pick me up easy. I want that to happen so badly. I am goign to write in this everyday. And I am going to lose weight. A pound a day. Thats what I want. Sooo badly!

Until tomorrow."

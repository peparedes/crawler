The world around me keeps spinning, bringing happiness and stress and accomplishment and worry, all packaged up with a messy bow that keeps us wondering what is next.  Many of my friends and family have been blessed with good fortune in 2006, which has brought vicarious pleasure to all.  My own good fortune was to change jobs to a great company this spring, behind-the-scenes politics aside.

The new phone that I picked came in last week and even though it's the same manufacturer (Motorola), it doesn't have any of the ringtones that came pre-programmed on my old phone :(

How would I go about finding these ringtones (from the old Motorola V60 series) to can download to the current Motorola GSM flip-phones?  I've gotten used to the different rings I use for calls, messages, etc for the past three years and want to keep them if I can.

Or if I can't find these exact ringtones, where can I find **free** ringtones that won't cost me a d/l or monthly fee?  I've never used anything like this before, so I'm clueless where to start (or even how to get/load the ringtone if I do find it) -- would someone help me please?"

"event","So my RL best friend has finally gotten into reading the HP books and watching the movies...and she knows that I love the books, so we've been discussing them as she reads them and watching the dvds together.  She's halfway thru OOTP now, so I asked her if she saw anything about Harry's year 5 Christmas gifts that she wanted to discuss, and the only thing she mentioned was asking if the broom from Tonks was really like his real one.  I made the mistake of mentioning that some people online think that JKR's decision to have Remus and Sirius give a gift <b>together</b> was significant...and she made a face that had my heart sinking faster than the Titanic :(  

I hate that <i>so few</i> of my RL friends are open to accept people being different (it took *forever* to find someone to go with to BBM), especially since so many of my RL friends are already part of a religious minority.

"event","...so I was rudely awakened almost two hours ago by some loud noise (just discovered it was the trash guys coming a day late and trying to make up time in the dark!) and had a song running thru my head when it happened.  I thought at first I must have been listening to some sarah mclachlan tunes last night, but I checked on windows media player and none of her songs have played all week, so I'm thinking and thinking and ow, it's too early to be thinking...

anyway, the singer sounded like sarah mclachlan and the lyrics that I remember included ""am I in heaven"" but I know the next line was *not* ""or am I in hell"" like in ""hold on""<strike>; there was another line later that seemed lifted from another sarah mcl song but I can't remember it now. I figured out that the song in my head was the background music of the last scene of some show I've watched in the past week or so.  I remember thinking that I should write down the lyrics that I could decipher behind the dialog, but I guess I forgot and have since deleted whatever it was off of my dvr :(

does anyone have any idea what show or song this was?  I tried searching but I keep getting ""hold on"" lyrics or news of the placement of ""fallen"" on last week's ""cold case"" -- I can't remember much except that this was the last or next to last scene of the show (possibly ""close to home""?), and the song played louder at the beginning and end of the scene to 'frame' the dialog.</strike>

err, so I<strike>'m stupid</strike> was more tired than I thought...it was ""hold on"" and it was at the end of ""crossing jordan""; the show just muted/edited parts of the song, so I only heard a part of the song that I didn't remember as well.

and I have to apologize for going awol for the past month or so -- I haven't stopped reading, but I've constantly been at skip=300 or more trying to catch up, as my lj reading time comes in very short spurts lately."

I stumbled into a Burt's Bees demonstration at my favourite farmers market last year and walked away with a large bag of small and sample size products, none of which really won me over, but I got to try a product that wasn't in our bags, and simply fell in love.  and this weekend, I found out that Bath and Body Works now sells it!  so off I went to use part of a store credit...I had to stop myself at one small tub or I might have spent the whole card as this product is not expensive.

Have I read too much fic, so much so that canon doesn't ring true now?

<lj-cut text=""definitely spoiler-y rant"">HBP kind of reads like fan fiction...and not even like my favourite stories.  JKR throws in everything you wouldn't expect in the first two chapters, so much so that I had to re-read them before going on to chapter 3.  then it later becomes blatantly obvious that JKR read web chatter, as she proceeds to answer many of our question outright (Katie is a 7th year student now), but glosses over other details that we (<b>read: I</b>) would rather know (like what is happening with Remus).  She's hinting at shipping (did Hermione kiss Krum?  what would happen to Harry if R/Hr happens?  does Harry like Ginny?) in places, then smushes our faces in it in others (just read the Ron/Lav at the party scene).

I'm not racing to finish, except in that I want to be sure that I don't get spoiled for the second half of the book before I get through it.  Huh, I think that that phrasing tells you just how enthused I am about finishing :(

"event","Is there anyone out there who understands hardware glitches?  I can fix software stuff on my own, but hardware kind of mystifies me...

I think my computer has somehow ""forgotten"" that it has cd and dvd drives...I suspected this was the case earlier this week when I couldn't get Windows Media Player to play a cd someone loaned me, but I was too tired to investigate it that night.  Now I'm sure this is the case -- I went into Windows Explorer and it won't list my D or E drives, and another software that I tried told me ""no CD drive found""!!  When I put a cd in, it starts to make the ""I'm reading the disc"" whirring noise for less than a second, but then stops.

Rebooting won't make a difference, as I've shut down several times since this problem first surfaced.  I can't bear to think of losing all my data that I foolishly haven't backed up, but now can't since I have no working CD-RW drive...

This computer is only 7 months old, it can't be this broken already :(

<b>ETA:</b>  after over an hour with Tech Support, we think that is has to do with the drivers for these drives somehow getting corrupted...he wants me to do a System Restore to a month ago.  What will I lose if I do this?

And I now think it may have been caused by installing Nero software, since the restore date is right before I installed this; does anyone know of another software that I can get free that will assist me with burning cds (both audio and data), as well as possibly printing cd covers?

<b>ETA 2:</b>  I officially dislike my computer -- now my firewall and internet connection are acting up and I've having to use a verrrrrrrrrry old computer to post now :(  Can I start today over again please?"

I was trying to finish reading my f'list and get to sleep, all with the TV on behind me.  I could hear the musical guest on ""Last Call"" sounded <b>Reggae/Jamaican</b>, and I was curious what he looked like.  I turned around and saw *not at all* what I expected:

<a href=""http://www.hasidicreggae.com/"">Matisyahu</a> is a <b>Hasidic Jew</b>, in full beard/payos/Black coat/Black Hat, and I think I even saw tzitzit!  

How have I never heard of him before?  He sounds quite authentically Reggae (to me), and he was dancing around like I've only seen when I peeked around a mechitza on an especially rambunctious Shabbos.  I couldn't believe how many kids in the crowd were obviously MOT, many of the boys had kippot, girls in long sleeves/long skirts :)

I did a quick Google search to learn more since his website seems to be overloaded, and I figured out why his eyes looked unfocused -- he <a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/06/20/jewish_mc_rocks_the_mike_and_keeps_it_kosher/"">takes off his glasses when performing</a> to avoid seeing immodestly-dressed women.  If I was Hasidic, I might just be in love with this guy based on this level of respect.

"event","So I did my *third* Locks of Love donation last week, and I'm still getting used to it.  I'll probably have my friend who owns her own salon ""fix"" this mistake of a free haircut, b/c I specifically told the <strike>idiot</strike> stylist that I did <b>not</b> want a blunt cut, but except for a small bit of layering that the <strike>idiot</strike> stylist started to do before cutting her <i>own</i> hand, it's a blunt cut ;p

I'm hoping that this upload works:
<lj-cut text=""images cut for flist pages"">

it was down to my waist!   <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v382/amoeba_j/precutloose.jpg"">

this is what almost 12 inches of cut hair looks like...   <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v382/amoeba_j/donation.jpg"">

the end result -- but it's not curly, it's frizzy!   <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v382/amoeba_j/shorthair.jpg"">
</lj-cut> 

Without posting a picture of my face, can anyone suggest a good style?  I don't want to cut more than another inch or so at the most, but I hate the layers that have been cut in so far...

ETA - woohoo, I got the pictures resized and everything...go me!!
(It's after 2am, so my computer skills are probably a little impaired at this point ;)

Here's hoping that I have good dreams when I finally fall asleep, influenced by reading <lj user=""teaspoon_love""> tonite ;D

ETA 2 -- I forgot to post, I'm walking again :)  thanks to everyone who asked/sent good wishes!  Physical therapy is going well, and I'm hoping for a decent settlement from the store where this happened...the ER bills alone were nearly $1000!

ETA 3 ---  some guy just rang my doorbell <b>twice</b>, and it's 2:53 am!!!  Since this is the third time it's happened in about a month, I actually yelled out ""how is it?"" from the safety of my bedroom, only to hear an unfamiliar name and voice...oh crap!  so I just yelled back that he had the wrong house and I saw him walk away, and <i>not</i> just over to my next door neighbor...wish I'd been awake enough to see a better description, but hopefully that will be a moot point."

"event","...that I'm about to lose ownership over, that is.  I have an appointment in less than 8 hours to do my third Locks of Love hair donation.  

<lj-cut text=""cut for rambling about hair anxiety"">I don't know anything at all about this salon where I'm going except from their website, and I think that is what is freaking me out a little.  The first donation was just random stylists hired by Clairol for a nationwide hair drive.  The second donation was at a chic salon in the ""popular"" part of town.  But this time, I couldn't find any salons willing to give me a real style after the blunt cut, so I searched the locksoflove.org website to find one.  The one I found is pretty far from my house, and I'm a little put off by some of the things the owner put on the salon website, but that's just b/c I think we have some differing opinions on some things that are completely non-hair-related.

I have no idea how I want it styled after the blunt cut is done -- I'm not even sure yet if I'm donating just the minimum 10 inches or going up to 12 inches, so I can't tell how short it's going to get.

I hope that I picked a good stylist.

I hope she can help me find a style I like as much as the last salon gave me.  It sucks that my old stylist isn't <i><b>allowed</b></i> by the owners of his new salon to cut hair anymore; he can only do colour now  :(   I would have gone back to him in a heartbeat.

I think I've just gotten so used to my long hair this time b/c I waited longer between donations this time (14 months from cut #1 to cut #2, but 34 months since cut #2 until now) because I kept it medium-ish length for almost a year after cut #2.  Except for these donations, I've had long hair nearly my whole life...I only cut it short voluntarily once, when I was graduating college, and that was mostly b/c I was trying to cut off horrible layers.  The one good thing about *that* cut was that my hair was naturally wavy for the first time ever.  Of course that was the shortest it had been since I was 2 years old, so it was much less heavy than before I cut off the layers!  (I have <b>very thick</b> hair.)  I wonder if it will curl again this time; I <b>really</b> hope so, but that was over 10 years ago, and I'm sure my hair's ""personality"" has changed since then.

Every time I've donated, I've had at least one friend go with me to ""hold my hand in case I cry,"" but it's really to hold me there so I don't try to run away at the last second!  I think we'll have a digital camera to take before/after pics; if they come out decent, I'll finally make myself learn how to upload pics from my computer to the web.  </lj-cut>

...I already miss my hair, but I know I'm doing a wonderful thing by donating it."

I was at a grocery store yesterday, and just as I finished, I slipped on a big puddle of what looked like melted chocolate ice cream...in the *produce* section!!  First of all, who was the idiot who opened whatever melted on the floor...and why in produce?!?!

I proceeded to spend the next four-plus hours with incompetent EMS who somehow forgot to let the ER know I was there, a fairly rude ER person, and some majorly brown-nosing personnel from the store where I fell.  The store people seemed to be sorry that it happened and even helped me get my car home since I couldn't drive after the *wonderful* meds the ER gave me, but now I can't work the rest of the week since my current job involves being on my feet 100% of the time and that isn't possible until I get off my crutches.

Maybe I should try to get some interviews for permanent jobs in my real occupation... the sympathy vote might get me a second interview!  I just have to remember not to take any pain meds beforehand LOL

"event","hmmm...I finally decided that I would get a LJ, but now I can't think of what to write in my first post.  I found LJ kind of by accident a few months ago, when a HP fanfic writer mentioned hers in a group email, and it kind of exploded from there ;)   I never knew there was so much out there!  

So I figured I wouldn't lurk anonymously anymore, and finally signed up today...it seemed like a good way to break up the day in between rejection calls/emails from head-hunters!  

I feel like I should write a gripping intro post, but everything I thought of just fell flat.  And since I mostly have used LJ (so far) to read fic writers' journals,  I just want to say thank you to the talented writers who distract and entertain me with their fantastic stories :)  and even with tales of their not-so-boring real lives too -- reading about your RL stuff makes me feel more normal ;)



*and no, I don't think of myself as single-celled; ""amoeba"" was an accidental nickname that I acquired long ago but don't really use anymore, so I figured it was a ""safe"" anonymous name to use*"

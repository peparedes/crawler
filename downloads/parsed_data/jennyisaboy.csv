<lj-cut text=""allow me to explain..."">allow me to explain my living situation... I live in a house that isn't a house... my house is 5 ""studio apartments."" 2 of them are in the back of the house and I didn't know those people before I moved in... they share a kitchen and bathroom that are ""common areas."" in the front is me and my two room mates... I know them we don't call it apartments or common areas we call it our house... we share a kitchen and bathroom also... I tell you this so that you understand this better...

tonight I was informed by one of my roommates that one of the people that lives in the back apartments leaves out bread for a skunk that he says lives under our house... he leaves it there so that it doesn't spray him...

wow...</lj-cut>


also tonight I received a facebook message from a stranger... here is what it says...

"event","so... I had some rum tonight... it was nice... then I realized I was hungry and I thought, ""I know, I'll walk down to Kirkwood and get some nachos at La Bamba's..."" I got put my jacket on over my hoodie put the hood up and walked outside... I lit a cigarette and started walking... shortly afterwards I realized... it has been raining all day... its raining now... but I'd really like some nachos... so I walked to La Bambas... got some nachos... ate them and walked back... I got back to the house... and realized that I don't think I've ever smoked a cigarette that was that wet... I also realized that I was fucking drenched... it was fun...

also during my walk I decided to make an Livejournal..."

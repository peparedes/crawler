"event","I find myself in some city, in an area of abandoned buildings. It's evening the sun is just starting to set. There is a large group of homeless kids nearby. All of them speak English with Russian accents. I approach and some of the kids stop me. I tell them I am looking for someone. A couple tell me to get lost. Another kid asks me for a name. I tell him Sasuke. The kids who told me to get lost stop almost startled before continuing back to their barrel fire. Another kid tells me he's in the building on the left and to use the door in the back. I go in. It's like a barracks bunk beds all around it's filthy and smells awful. There is only one person inside. It's him the one I'm looking for. As I walk towards him he looks up then stands up a small smile appears as quickly across his face as it disappears. I give him a hug and a kiss on the forehead. He reeks, I doubt he's showered in weeks and his clothes are just as filthy. He's probably strung out. The distant look in his eyes reminds me of how severely damaged he is. We sit down on his bunk. I ask him if he still has my number. He looks through his things and pulls out a slip with my old number. I give him my new number, my address, and some money. I know he'll probably use the money on drugs, but I can only hope he uses it to help himself out. I sit with him on his bunk talking with him. I let him know that if he ever needs anything to come find me or call me. I give him a hug and smile come back onto his face. I ask him if I'll see him again. He nods still smiling. He sits back down on his bunk as I leave."

"event","I was sorting through all the work I've had done on my car since 2002. I added up all the costs.

     What I paid (amount total after additional from other sources) 
2002 $75.24
2003 $323.00
2004 $578.69 ($4198.65 amount after insurance for major accident)
2005 $1999.02
2006 $975.16 ($1882.06 Bday present from my parents)
2007 $1772.79
2008 $1747.53
2009 $428.27 thus far... I have to put my car in the shop again soon as my driver side window is now broken and the wiring of one of my lights is rotting out again. This right after I just had my windshield wiper transmission replaced.

So since 2002 I have spent $7899.70 out of my pocket ($12426.56 with help). That's an average of $1067.34 a year (1714.04 with help).

From 2002 to 2006 my car payments add another $3336.96 per year.

So since I first got the car I've paid $29111.36 for it. And that not including gas.

But without this car I never would have been able to move to western MA and would not be making the money I am now. This car has given me a tremendous amount of freedom no matter what the cost."

Depp to play Tonto, Mad Hatter in upcoming films
Thursday September 25 12:09 AM ET

Johnny Depp is becoming the new face of Walt Disney Studios. The actor will preside over the manic tea party in Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" as the Mad Hatter and will play Tonto in ""The Lone Ranger,"" whose latest screen incarnation is being produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.

Disney formally announced the casting Wednesday at a studio presentation. It also said it is officially in development on a fourth installment of ""Pirates of the Carribean,"" which would see Depp reprise his popular role of Captain Jack.

On the ""Alice"" front, Depp and Burton -- who first worked together in 1990's ""Edward Scissorhands"" and most recently collaborated on ""Sweeney Todd"" -- have formed one of the longest-running director-actor partnerships in modern Hollywood. When Burton committed to filming a new live-action/CG-animated version of ""Alice,"" Depp was touted as the most likely candidate to play the Mad Hatter -- after all, having worked with Burton on ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" he's practiced in wearing a top hat.

 
Mia Wasikowska, the young Australian actress who appeared in HBO's ""In Treatment,"" has the film's title role.

Matt Lucas, who stars in the sketch comedy series ""Little Britain USA,"" which debuts on HBO Sunday, is set to play the dual roles of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

""Ranger,"" meanwhile, puts Depp back in business with Bruckheimer, who produced the ""Pirates"" movies. Tonto is the Native American colleague of cowboy hero the Lone Ranger. The casting could stir up controversy with Native American groups, who might accuse the studio of putting a white actor in the role. One factor that could counter such an argument is Depp's mixed ancestry, which includes German, Irish, and Cherokee.

""Ranger"" is being written by ""Pirates"" scribes Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and has no director at this time.

"event","1. When his 38-caliber revolver failed to fire at his intended victim 
during a hold-up in Long Beach , California , would-be robber James Elliot 
did something that can only inspire wonder. He peered down the barrel 
and tried the trigger again. This time it worked. 

2. The chef at a hotel in Switzerland lost a finger in a meat-cutting 
machine and submitted a claim to his insurance company. The company 
expecting negligence sent out one of its men to have a look for himself. 
He tried the machine and he also lost a finger. The chef's claim was 
approved. 

3. A man who shoveled snow for an hour to clear a space for his car 
during a blizzard in Chicago returned with his vehicle to find a woman 
had taken the space. Understandably, he shot her. 

4. After stopping for drinks at an illegal bar, a Zimbabwean bus driver 
found that the 20 mental patients he was supposed to be transporting 
from Harare to Bulawayo had escaped. Not wanting to admit his 
incompetence, the driver went to a nearby bus stop and offered everyone 
waiting there a free ride. He then delivered the passengers to the 
mental hospital, telling the staff that the patients were very excitable 
and prone to bizarre fantasies. The deception wasn't discovered for 3 
days. 

5. An American teenager was in the hospital recovering from serious 
head wounds received from an oncoming train. When asked how he received 
the injuries, the lad told police that he was simply trying to see how 
close he could get his head to a moving train before he was hit. 

6. A man walked into a Louisiana Circle-K, put a $20 bill on the 
counter, and asked for change. When the clerk opened the cash drawer, 
the man pulled a gun and asked for all the cash in the register, which 
the clerk promptly provided. The man took the cash from the clerk and 
fled, leaving the $20 bill on the counter. The total amount of cash he 
got from the drawer: $15. (If someone points a gun at you and gives you 
money, is a crime committed? ) 

7. Seems an Arkansas guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that 
he'd just throw a cinder block through a liquor store window, grab some 
booze, and run. So he lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his 
head at the window. The cinder block bounced back and hit the would-be 
thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. The liquor store window was 
made of plexiglass. The whole event was caught on videotape. 

8. As a female shopper exited a New York convenience store, a man 
grabbed her purse and ran. The clerk called 911 immediately, and the 
woman was able to give them a detailed description of the snatcher. 
Within minutes, the police apprehended the snatcher. They put him in 
the car and drove back to the store. The thief was then taken out of the 
car and told to stand there for a positive ID. To which he replied, 
""Yes, officer, that's the lady I stole the purse from. "" 

9. The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a 
Burger King in Ypsilanti , Michigan , at 5 a. m. , flashed a gun, and 
demanded cash. The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn't 
open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion 
rings, the clerk said they weren't available for breakfast. The man, 
frustrated, walked away. 
 
10. When a man attempted to siphon gasoline from a motor home parked on 
a Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for. Police arrived 
at the scene to find a very sick man curled up next to a motor home 
near spilled sewage. The police spokesman said the man admitted to 
trying to steal gasoline and plugged his siphon hose into the motor 
home's sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the vehicle declined to 
press charges, saying that it was the best laugh he'd ever had."

"event","10:39am July 21 2007 I woke exited my room and went pee. Walked into the kitchen and saw a box that said Harry Potter. I grabbed it and ran into my room. I tore open the box and pulled out the long awaited book. I gathered food and drinks and set them by my bed.

10:45am Started reading the book.

1:30am July 22 2007 Stopped reading and went to bed. I didn't read constantly I took approximately an hours worth of breaks.

9:30am Woke up went pee and started reading.

2:00pm Took shower. Read a little more. Took about 30 minutes worth of breaks.

2:30pm Left for work.

7:00pm Began reading at work.

8:00pm Passed meds.

8:20pm Resumed reading.

11:15pm Finished the book.

Total time to read 21 hours 55 minutes

Now that Harry Potter is done. I don't have anything to look forward to. Xenosaga is done, sadly prematurely. There's Fruits Basket but I finished it online. Naruto? It doesn't mean as much to me. The Sox won a World Series. My love of video games has greatly diminished and they don't draw me to them like they once did. Music? I've moved on just like most people have. What there is now is not for me. Warlord? I haven't played in how long? The game has fallen into the wrong hands and left me uninterested.There's DragonCrest. I get that in a steady supply and it isn't something I really obsess about. 

What I am saying is I just finished my last obsession. I don't have anymore obsessions. I feel kind of lost without one. One could argue about the Sox. But it isn't like it was before they won it all in 2004. One could say the Pats. But if I were truly obsessed with either I probably wouldn't be living with someone who despises sports. 

I need new obsessions. I need to find new things."

The Sixth Sign: A gang shooting at a Nickelodeon Awards Show after party, unfortunately no celebrities were shot.

Honorable Mention: Josh and Shannon have produced a child. This will become an official sign if the child's birthmark clears up and reveals 666.

The Fifth Sign: On Feburary 24th at 7:53pm the world welcomed my nephew Geoffrey Christian. The fifth sign of the Apocalypse has occured. My brother is breeding.

The Fourth Sign: Korric just fagged out on me. 
Korric's Clarification: Korric does not suddenly like to get slammed in the ass by big hairy muscular men. Furthermore he does not like to choke on sweaty cock, nor does he like jizz to be sprayed in his face. Therefore Korric is not a homo, although he acts like a flaming queen who could ignite marshmallows, Korric is not a queer.

The Third Sign: Mike and Colleen are married. And a wonderful and loyal loving two years.

The Second Sign: George Bush getting re-elected.

The First Sign: The Red Sox winning the World Series."

2/27/07 and 4/17/07. Numbers fifty something and fifty something.

I completely spaced on Laura's Birthday and missed a good time. Sorry. So I thought we should go bowling sometime, my treat.

I need a haircut.

I hate living in Northampton. I can't wait to leave.

I've been debating about coming out at work. It goes against my principles of keeping my work and personal lives seperate. But it would create some funny wtf moments and allow me to stop dopping hints to my coworker the oblivious gay guy.

In a couple of weeks I'll be able to larp again after 5 months of nothing.

I have a social life. It's just 150 miles away. On that accursed island."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well here goes, this thing has been brewing in my head for a while now. It has been wanting to come out, but I've been holding it in, to afraid to show weakness. Fear and anxiety of what's to come and loneliness the likes of which I haven't felt before, have dropped me into depression. I don't make it obvious. I have responsibilities I must take care of so I can't just wallow in pity and sleep all day. I hide the depression from others due to my anxiety and paranoia of others who in my own head would use it against me. At times I've tricked myself into thinking I wasn't depressed due to hiding it so well. I've had years of practice and honed the skill by not revealing my problems to the ones who have been trained to sense and uncover them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fear and anxiety are coming from the fact in five months I don't know where I am going to be. I have blindly walked into an intersection with more paths than I can comprehend. Do I move? If so where? Do I stay? Do I go back to school? Where? The different possibilities have stunned me. Three months ago I was convinced I would be moving to North Carolina. One month ago I was going to Arizona. Right now I'm staying put so I can go back to school and keeping my job that I hate but I can't afford to leave. I recently realized a lot of the fear coming from the future was the fact that I may lose my surrogate older brother. Without him I never would have succeeded out here. I have a hard time imagining life without him around at all. With life comes loss, I guess.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lonliness has been really bad lately. I consider winter to be the most romantic season so that may be magnifing the problem. I have become a shut in. I have no social life in Western Mass. The transient nature of the area is partially to blame. Brendon was here and is now in Japan. Shannon and Josh were here but couldn't make it. Hell Ryan was here even if he was only tolerable in small doses. My social life is on Cape Cod. My personal life is what has been driving me crazy. My social self consciousness is so extreme that I can't even talk to people online even in anonymity. This has nothing to do with sex. I couldn't care less about that. Ijust want to be with someone. To be held&nbsp; close by someone. I've even flirted with the idea of playing it straight just so I could get that attention I so desperately crave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My depression has made me incredibly addicted to Youtube. I've literally spent 6 hours straight just watching videos. I'm finding myself watching videos about five hours a day now. I go online now and go straight to Youtube I barely check my mail and I haven't been looking at porn. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More to come. Hopefully soon. My chest feels a little lighter already."

"event","So I was walking up the walkway toward the library at Marist (too repetitive but how else can I put it?). For those of you who've seen this beautiful library, the front and back walkways are made up of individual blocks of stone. Because of the freezing temperatures, the blocks have shifted and some are raised more than others. In a weird way it adds to the beautiful-ness of the Marist campus, making the walkway older and unique--like cobblestones. I know I'm not making much sense...but a warning for those of you trekking on campus in the bitter cold---watch your step. And no I didn't trip! : )"

"event","So life as usual, is hectic. Florida came and went so fast I can't believe I was ever there. We spent most of the time at home with family, just grieving and supporting one another. Spent some afternoons at the pool and the beach. Went to the mall for a half hour. Literally. For those of you who know me and my love to shop, it was torture. Especially when there are amazing stores not in NY and nice things to look at...plus its nice to just browse but the family down there isn't into that stuff...anyways...The memorial was very nice except Karadyn was fussy and hungry so I spent the majority of my time outside with her. Now I'm back and in the full swing of things again. Seriously, I don't know if I want to go to school anymore. My schedule is ridiculous. I'm up at 6, class from 8-3:30, work till 7, Karadyn's bathtime and last feeding, my dinner, homework, maybe some time to relax if time allows it, and its in bed until 6am again...On the days I do not have classes I am at my internship from 9-2. What I didn't mention is my lack of eating breakfast...the most important meal of the day...and since I'm losing weight I NEED to make time for it...contemplating getting p at 5:30 just so I can squeeze in eating. Damn. Oh yea and I also go to the gym every other night so I miss my time with Karadyn. Sucks. I miss spending time with her. Sometimes when I look at her I think, ""God, I can't believe how big she is already."" Already!?!?!?! She's going to be 10 months old next week and I've already begun planning her birthday. In addition to all of that stuff, I'm fixing up my resume, trying to get my grad school apps in, looking for a job and a place to live. UGH thinking about it makes my brain hurt. Tonight I have off from work and all I want to do is sleep. Get some good chinese take out and blockbuster videos and I'm set. Hm.....

I need to keep in touch with friends more. I haven't spoken to Kelley in god knows how long, Tom in weeks, Nina since well the other day but that's because she's going to Iraq soon and I won't be able to talk to her, Renee in months. Some other friends I speak to randomly but I seriously do not have time. I bought a new cell phone so I can walkie-talkie and drive, hoping that will be my friend-catch up time. Once I get time to transfer in all of those numbers....I can see that'll take awhile too. 

Hope everyone enjoyed my *blah* update. It's pretty much a rant of my schedule conflicts but whatever. It's all that I have going on. Later yall : )"

"event","Yea so things have been incredibly hectic since my last update. C'est la vie I guess. I did decent in school this semester despite my last minute going to FL for an impending death and missing important classes, homework, etc. One more semester!! Right now I'm doing the job search thing and submitting my apps to Grad school. So far I'm applying to Marist and Villanova and maybe John Jay. Not much excitement going on right now...Monday I leave for Florida for a MUCH NEEDED vacation before school. I may be spending NYE with Ryan...we'll see. I'm not expecting too much after the past scumbags. Speaking of which, I saw him the other day; what a loser. I definitely won in that situation. Nuff said. I was all pumped to finish this update and now I'm too tired. Maybe I'll get to it tomorrow night. I'm going to go read and get some sleep. Later y'all : )"

"event","So its been a while since I updated...it always seems to run in the same pattern though. Ah well. hey, if someone can show me how to upload some pictures on here that would be great (hint hint, Kelley). 

SO MUCH has gone on since I last wrote too. Kelley came up last weekend to visit and it was so nice to just relax and catch up. We went and saw The Forgotten on Sat night and Sunday we went out to lunch and hit up the mall. Karadyn loved Kelley too! Check out Kelley's journal (under my friends link) for pictures of us. 

This past weekend I went out to dinner with my friend Ryan. We went to that new restaurant in Fishkill (Via Nove I think?) and went to the movies to see the Grudge. Weird movie and it had some jumpy points, but all in all it was like the Ring. It was fun night though and I had an awesome time...its nice to finally go out with a guy who isn't like all of the others.....Even though it was just a friends thing I had a great time and look forward to going out again. Right now I'm just focused on my last semester and graduation....plus getting a real full time job. If something laid back evolves, I wouldn't mind. 

Speaking of school, I've got an interview next week for an Internship with the Public Defender's Office. It's going to be weird sitting in a courtroom against all of the cool lawyers I worked with last year....but interesting I'm sure. 

Well I'm gonna go before class starts. Hopefully I'll be updating shortly with pictures!!!!!"

All I have to say...is I read Kelley's journal just now...and I'm inspired. Kel, you are the woman! My inspiration! I feel overwhelmed and I think of Kelley..and all that she does...and that damn student newspaper. Ha.

"event","So much random stuff has been going on recently, I don't even know where to begin or what to talk about...I'm sure I'll forget tons of stuff too. Maybe next time? 

First, I'll talk about Karadyn since she's mah babes...She's getting SO big, about 15 pounds now. August 3rd she was 4 months old. I'm teaching her how to roll over...she's almost got it down. Right now she's rolling on her side in the crib so she can better access her aquarium. Damn she learned how to turn it on and off, so randomly at like 4am the music starts and wakes me up, and then she starts her ""talking"" where she screams and shrieks because she can hear herself...haha its so damn cute but at 4 am it just plain sucks. I still find myself smiling though, just because its such an amazing thing to create a baby. One act made her to be what she is, at this moment, and that is a miracle people. A freaking miracle. If you think about it, and Nina pointed this out when I got pregnant, so much has to be precise in order to get pregnant...think about it. I'm happy where I am and wouldn't change a thing, single 21 yr old mother and all! 

School...I dread it but I wish it was here already. Makes sense? I think not. I want my summer to continue, but at the same time its my last year before I graduate and I just want it to be over. I want to graduate and find out where I'm going. Moving sounds better everyday but we'll see. I may stay around here and get my Master's...or go away and get it...hmm the possibilities. I guess I am just so anxious because the rest of my life is a big WHAT IF...I'm supposed to take the LSATs in October but I think that's on hold. It's all too much to think about right now, and I've got a migraine. Blah.

Good news...I'm going on vacation in Sept..missing a few days of school but its alright. We're going to Florida and I can't wait. Beaches and swimming await...I can feel the warm breezes now. 

I can't think about much else right now besides sleep. My head hurts and I'm exhausted. I'll catch up at some point about all of the other craziness in my life. Later yall :)"

"event","I'm talking to Tom right now...I miss that boy so much. We had fun in Disney although I admit he did piss me off sometimes by slacking on the things he was in charge of. Anyways, I keep saying I've got to make a trip down to GSP. We all know how much I love that mall...its heaven. :) Plus maybe I can get some new new-b's cause he's got the hook up. Oh ya...love those sneakers. I think we may plan another trip next summer because he's a good vacation buddy, pretty much anyways...

My topic tonight is regarding things I've been having to deal with. I want to be done with school. I want Karadyn to be moving around more (I say that now). I want to be working so I can make some decent money and get my debts paid off. I want to know where I will be in the next year and a half...(Virginia? Law school? Master's degree? Working where? LIVING where??)....Very contemplative tonight I guess.

Tomorrow is my last day working until 2..then its 9-5. The hours suck but if its slow, Deb already knows we're bringing homework. I am glad I can seriously say I love my job. It rules. :) Nuff said.

Haven't spoken to Scott or Jen...I guess its better off. I don't intend to speak to him, that's for sure. Just his parents.. :) They're so cool. Anyways, I think I'm pretty much past the whole situation. I will always have strong opinions about him, but whatever makes them happy. I can be the adult in the situation. Now as long as I don't get involved with anymore assholes or scumbags, I should be alright. I guess when someone lies to your face like that, it's easy to fall into the trap of believing everything they say. Ah well...no mas for me. 

I'm gonna get going...work tomorrow. I'm sleepy. Hope to update more this weekend..lots going on! Lata :)"

"event","So lots of drama this past week...Scott turned out to be a liar and a cheater. Funny thing is, he keeps telling people that I am the one who exaggerated things and wanted the relationship more than him...BUT he forgets. He told people who we both know how he pursued me, etc. We hung out with people from work who saw how him and I were together. You can't lie about that, now can you? The thing is, of course he would make me out to be the liar and the crazy one. He is the one with something to hide...if it was known him and I were together, he wouldn't have been in the other relationship. Why would I lie? I had nothing to hide from anyone. Sadly, I still have the picture of him, Karadyn and I on my desk...I will be taking it down since our whole relationship was based on one big lie. He isn't worth looking at everyday at work...I can't believe anything he ever said to me because day after day he lied to my face, hiding the fact that he was also with someone else. Yea, that's true love. It's also sad that I did fall in love, hard, with him. I had feelings for him that I've never felt for anyone else before, and I really saw us having a future. It bothers me that I ended up being ""rebound"" or a game, or whatever it can be interpreted as. Bottom line, he used me and took advantage of me when I was the most vulnerable and THAT is what hurts. C'est la vie. I just wanted to make all of this perfectly clear because I know I'm not a liar, and it pisses me off being called one. Like I said before, I have nothing to hide so why should I lie? I'm chalking this up to another asshole, another learning experience. I'll be fine and move on...and what's more, is I have great friends to support me. Scott lost me as a friend...and he lost his other person as well...anyone would be an idiot to deal with him and his mess. At least until he gets some help. On a better note, I'm moving on already. Right now Karadyn is my sole focus, along with my family and my true friends. 

I'm going to go spend some quality time with my daughter before she falls asleep, and maybe watch a movie. Later."

"event","It's been a long day and I'm exhausted. I was up at 8 with Karadyn (hey, at least she is sleeping through the night now!!) and I didn't get much sleep after she was done eating...I think about an extra hour or so. Anyway, I was supposed to go to the flea market with Scott today but I think there was some fluke thing with my car. It felt like it was going to die when I was waiting at the mall for him but this evening when I started it up again it seemed ok. Hmmm...maybe soon I'll have a new car. I'm going to look at a 2004 Honda Accord Tuesday afternoon. So back to the story...instead of going out with Scott I was being domestic...got a lot of cleaning done, laundry, washed the cats...not exciting but its done. Yay. 

Scott and I are doing ok...its still so weird, and sometimes difficult to think about our situation. Sometimes I cry when I think about our current status, and sometimes I smile...when I try and think about good times we've had so far. It's funny, we still do the same things as if we were together. I am trying so hard to respect his wishes and give him space though; I just hope HE realizes this. I love talking to him on the phone/seeing him...so when he calls or asks me to hang out there is no way I want to say no. I just feel bad because at the same time I feel like I'm not giving him space......if that makes sense. Even though I am still semi in that ""crying a lot phase"" I can honestly say I have had an awesome time with Scott. God only knows what the future holds. I'm pretty confident that Scott and I will be together so I'm trying not to have any major worries. Like I said, only God knows...
     I even tried making a list of things I want to accomplish this summer with my ""newfound freedom."" I even included my dorkness by adding in organizing things and finally getting to my spring cleaning. 

Only 2 more months until school begins up again. I'm excited for my senior year but also glad summer is finally here *for me anyways...I got 3 grades out of 4 so far...an A and 2 A-s...on a roll with a 3.8 GPA. Go me! :) Annnd the dorkness comes out.

I'm going to go take some time out for myself and read since Karadyn is in her crib (BTW, she's gonna be 3 months old next weekend)!! I'm reading this book right now called ""This Lullaby."" Pretty good; I've got about half of the book to go and I just started it the other night. Anyways, later all :)"

"event","I had my heart broken today. Scratch that....not just broken, but ripped from my chest. Now all that's left is a big, big black hole. I've been stripped of the very organ which allows me to live. to feel. emotion. Oddly enough, I am still feeling a flood of emotions, accompanied by that annoying emotion, sadness and pain. The pain has taken over my whole body. Where did it all begin?

Obviously, Scott and I broke up. This afternoon. The day after our 2 month anniversary. I know, after the first month only the special ones (6 months, a year, and so on...) should be celebrated. With Scott it was different. I was so extremely happy to reach each milestone practically unscathed, to be as happy with him as our first date/kiss/officialness with one another. Last night we went to dinner at OG, of course. :) I had a horrible day at work and also had a major migraine so I was pretty cranky but seeing Scott made me feel so much better already. My head still hurt a ton and I could barely look up from my plate. We didn't have much to talk about, besides his nephew being born a few hours earlier. I was so excited for him and when we parted after dinner everything seemed fine. I still cried in the car on the way home...being emotional that time of the month is what started it. Something felt wrong, even though everything seemed fine. If that makes sense. I calmed myself down while driving, mostly so I could see, but I did some thinking too. Things with Scott and I were different, but not worse...I saw no obvious warning signs of a breakup, but I still couldn't get it out of my head. Before reaching my house, I'd convinced myself we were going through the phase where we are past being with one another 24/7 which would explain the less hanging out, etc. Last night we said our ""goodnights"" and ""I love yous"" and he asked me about calling the Dr. for my migraines...I fell asleep happy, telling myself that I was right about my previous assumption...that Scott and I were fine, still in love, etc. etc. So you can imagine my shock of being dumped the day after. Yup, it happened. I called this afternoon to see if he wanted to come over for lunch, and one thing led to another. Next thing I know, Scott says its better off being friends. At first I was taken aback and even asked if he was joking, but he wasn't. I'm not going to delve into our conversation points any further, but it hurt like hell. Falling in love with the one person who I thought I could count on, whom I loved with all of my heart in a way I have never loved before, and ending up having that same heart ripped from my chest in a minute. At one point I bawled so hard into the phone I had thought he hung up. Since that dreadful conversation, I cried like Karadyn does (all red faced and can't breathe), cried in the shower, cried while feeding her, and crying to sleep. I also cried during ""lunch"" and while changing Karadyn. I  cried while she cried as we walked around the house. I haven't really cried while writing this, which amazes me. I gave myself another migraine but got a nap out of the deal. I just took 4 tylenol and want to go back to sleep but Karadyn is up and will want to eat soon. Maybe I'll watch a movie Scott and I picked out, and cry some more I'm sure. It's just so extremely difficult. I've looked at my phone at least 50 times since we hung up, hoping it would ring and he'd say he changed his mind. No phone call. It's 4:30 and he should be getting out of work. I keep hoping he will stop by, but I know he won't. He's going to visit his nephew. No more IMs, cute away messages, text messages and voicemails in the middle of the night just to say ""I love you"" or ""I miss you."" The worst part is, I look at even Karadyn and I think of him. I think of the night I was in labor and he came from work to see me, rubbing my legs to take my mind off of my back pain. Waiting outside the room as she was born. Coming in right after to kiss me and tell me I did a great job and that he was so proud of me. Sending me flowers that day, which I saved the card from, repeating what he said that morning. Thinking about him staying with me the next 2 nights in the hospital so I wasn't alone. Coming to my house when I was home to keep me company. Since then we were inseparable. Maybe he's right...we rushed into things, but I believe our love is true. I hope he takes his time to think and do his own thing, and eventually realizes he lost something great. Until then I am left to look at my phone, have sleepless nights, cry fests with Karadyn, and try and mend this big hole in my chest. Until then...."

The majority of my time has been spent between work and Karadyn. I've also been sqeezing in some homework/internship time. Today I hope to get more homework done. My finals begin soon as well. I really can't wait to be done with this semester. It has dragged out for so long. I know I had off from actual class since the end of March, but come on. School has been officially out for 3 weeks now. Anyways, so much has been going on and that's why I haven't updated people. Sorry.

Karadyn is going to be 2 months old tomorrow and really is such a joy. I can't explain how happy I feel when I see all of the funny faces she makes, and most of all when she smiles when I'm holding her. She smiles now when she is happy and recognizes people. She loves Scott which is awesome...it makes me happy because god only knows what our future holds, but I am sure he is involved somewhere. Another great thing...he doesn't care if people think he is her father and he doesn't care that one day she may call him Dad. It makes me want to cry just thinking about it. I never thought I would find a man like him, who is so incredibly thoughtful of others and always makes sure her and I are happy. He is so wonderful in every way possible. I can't imagine my life without him; It's like Karadyn...I can't imagine my life before she came into the world...like something was always missing. I feel the same way with Scott. I can't get enough of him either...when we aren't together he is all I think about. I always want to be close to him, holding each other, spending all of our time together. If you read this again Scott, I love you so much baby. 

Gotta go do the mommy thing, Karadyn is getting hungry and I've got hmwk to do. Bye!"

"event","School ended on Friday. Not that I care, cause I'm not in class but technically I am. Since taking the Incomplete, I have until June to get ALL of my work done, including internship hours so I've been slacking some. Time for that to end. I'm torn as to what to start first. Read for Organized Crime and just take the final? Finish my Corrections paper so I can take the final? Finish my internship hours? Complete my Social Psych reading and paper and take the final? I also have an Internship paper to write too. Blah. I cannot wait to be done with college. At least I will feel like I am doing something more meaningful in law school...its like training for my career for 3 to 4 years. I can't wait to get sucked in to the law school atmosphere...I'm not even sure I know what the atmosphere is like but I bet it is everything I am and hope to become. 

Yesterday I went to the city with Scott for my birthday. He bought me Phantom of the Opera tickets and we also planned on an Italian dinner. For those of you who know me, I've wanted to see Phantom for over 6 or 7 years...and when I opened my card and they were there I had a dork smile for 20 minutes, seriously. The show was AMAZING!!!! Him and I were first timers and I'm glad we could experience it together. Afterwards when we were waiting to be seated for dinner, we planned our second trip to go see it again. I can't wait. Dinner was at Carmines on W. 44th St. and it was also wonderful. The portions are for two people so we shared Chicken Parm w/ Angel Hair pasta and had 2 Frozen Apple Martinis. It was sooo delicious. We even had leftovers, which are sitting in my fridge. I had some for lunch. Yum. After dinner we did some shopping and then took the train back. Other stuff happened, not going into detail obviously...I know...I'm probably asking for it...but it was perfect. Everything with us feels so completely normal, perfect..just right. I love him...its moving so fast and we're both ok with it. I think he's the one..I've thought long and hard about it too. I can't wait to be with him. I just can't get enough of him. What's even better is he feels the same exact way. Like I said...its perfect...just right."

Not much has been going on here. Karadyn is always a joy (except when she cries endlessly at 1:30am) but I still wouldn't change anything for the world. LOVE her to death. Its funny how people say it takes time to love a baby, that it isn't instant. It's true, at least in my case, but what people don't warn you about is how quickly that feeling changes from awe to complete and utter love. The day she was born I was so excited, nervous, scared...afraid to hold her as if I would break her into pieces. The next day I couldn't get enough of her and even cried as I left her in the nursery down the hall from my hospital room. Although I could always go back and see her, I needed the sleep badly. It was extremely difficult walking back to my room...and it scares me to think I love her this much already. I'm scared about how I'll react when she goes out to play, goes to school, sleeps over at a friend's house. I'm going to be a nervous wreck for the rest of my life. And ya know what?? It's ALL worth it."

I ended up going to the doctors on Friday morning for my weekly checkup when we determined my water had broke. I was sent to the hospital and admitted...induced at 4pm because there were no contractions, and I had her at 6:01 am on April 3rd. I had a lot of complications during labor...her cord ruptured and I was hemmoraging...I lost a LOT of blood and had 2 transfusions...but now the baby and I are doing fine. She's so beautiful and every moment of pain was worth it. The epidural did help though. : ) I have come to the conclusion that she looks more like me than Andrew. She's got his nose and black hair, but my chubby cheeks, eyes, mouth and chin. Didn't check the ears...maybe later. She was 7 lbs 12 oz, 21 inches long. Oh, and I changed her spelling too..its now Karadyn Alexis. Anyways, I'm going to go get a bite to eat before she wakes for her dinner. Later"

If you have something inside you for a total of 10 full months, and I've got a little more than ONE WEEK : ) to go, you tend to get impatient waiting for that thing to appear. I mean, 38.5 weeks is a long commitment for me. Ha I speak of this like the baby is some diet or gym fad. Normally I can go about 12-15 weeks with the things mentioned above, so I have to admit this is a definite stretch. I'm just getting impatient with the waiting. I can't wait to see what (and who) the baby looks like. I can't wait for her personality to shine through. For her to look at me like I look at my mother. Just to know she is finally here. I can't wait for her to roll over, crawl, laugh, say her first word (Hopefully it's Mom), and take that first step. It scares me that I will miss out on a lot of these firsts...especially because I'm planning on going to school full time until she's 1. Then I should be completely done with college---for now, until I decide on where I want to live and eventually go to law school. These are the things I am impatient about. Yes, I will miss some aspects of being pregnant. Like that first kick, and all of the movements you feel from then on. From just knowing that you created a life and that it is flourishing inside of you...and one day will come out as a human being. I won't miss my skin stretching, not being able to wear my jeans, not fitting into cute or comfortable shoes, my hair growing so fast that in 3-4 weeks it needs to be cut, etc. There are positives and negatives to being pregnant, and although I list more negatives, the positives will continue to grow and grow even after Carradyn is born. The negatives should cease to some degree; I hope. I just can't wait for her to enter my life, to see what changes we will both face together. How our lives will be together. I'm ready and I'm sure she's ready...but are we ready to take this on together? I'll just have to wait and see."

"event","Lately I've felt massive amounts of shadiness from some of my friends and its NOT COOL. I hate when people pretend to be friends and really aren't. It's like, we're never going to be friends, so why bother. For example, this girl Jamie who I go to school with has been an acquaintance of mine for the past year and a half. We hung out once. She thinks we're friends and I don't. We barely speak anymore...The last time we spoke she wanted answers for a final. Riiight. Anyways, I saw her this weekend at OG when I went to lunch with Dee. She totally blew me off when I said hi...and I was pissed because I wanted to explain myself: the fact that I have been on and off bedrest since like Christmas and its hard for me to hang out or talk on the computer..since I'm supposed to be in bed with my feet up all day long. Not too easy to drive like that, huh? Just pisses me off that she was like that. To make matters worse, I have closer friends who have been just as shady, if not more. I have a few friends who I was super close with at one point and we've grown apart. Yes, living in different areas is a problem, but still. I hate making phone calls and am constantly told to hang on while other friends are entertained in the background. Hello? You see them everyday. PLUS, I'm tired of hearing people say they have no money or some other excuse not to do anything. Its not easy to have tons of fun with no money, but there has been many a time I've still traveled to visit friends/done things and sacrificed other things because that person was important to me and I wanted to see them. I think others definitely have a different mind-set than I do, because this is definitely the most used excuse in the book. I just feel like certain people are putting me on the back burner until they feel like they have time to come visit/want to visit...or that they'll call me when they're bored or suddenly frustrated with the fabulous life they are living.

I dunno, maybe I'm bitter right now. I don't speak to many people anymore...even Nina. Married life is a different world and I don't understand what its like because I'm not there. Having a baby is definitely going to separate me from friends I have now.  When Carradyn comes, I'm going to be 10x busier and I know I'm going to lose touch. But with the way things are going, I feel I'm not going to have anyone to speak to when this is all over. UGH I HATE being bitter. That's life though. All I'm saying is if we are really friends, show it. Cause I'm definitely tired of being the one to try and make it work. If we aren't friends, stop being shady and cut ties. No harm done in the long run...I'm just tired of being dragged along. It feels like a bad relationship. Lata"

So on top of feeling yucky from that, I've got massive heartburn, cramping (normal side effect of the biopsy), and I feel so nauseous. Yuck.

I am totally feeling the school spirit. I watched all of the seeding on ESPN with my dad...Marist got the 14th seed and is playing #3 seed Oklahoma for the Midwest division. They are playing game 1 in Tempe, AZ. Not that anyone cares...haha. I'm just excited because FDU never made it this far and they were division One. To make this even more exciting, Marist has never been to the NCAA ever. Campus is going to be going wild if they do well. If not, I congratulate them for making it as far as they did. I know the feeling (somewhat)..when we beat Fishkill for the District Championship and went to the State Finals...never happened for us before. We lost the first game but that feeling will always stay with me. Go RED FOXES. Ok, I'm going to shut up now.

Onto more important things...like, my never ending babble about pregnancy. I've had pre-labor symptoms for a few weeks now and I found out Friday the baby is ready for action. I know I said this is my previous entry however. Maybe I'm still having false labor symptoms but I'm feeling different tonight. I've got crampiness in my back and legs and some slight contractions although Braxton Hicks contractions are normal pre-labor symptoms and I've already had those. Anyways, tonight could be THE night..and I'm pretty stoked. But tired. Soooooo I'm gonna pack my hospital bag, just in case, and get some rest. I'll definitely be keeping everyone updated.

I'm all packed and ready to go..now if only my body could see that, it'd begin labor NOW. These last few weeks have been hard. I'm so tired because I can't get comfortable at night, and the baby has been stressed due to the fighting going on here. Plus I have had a few minor complications and have been a regular at Vassar. They keep hoping I come back when its really time. And I can't truly say these complications have been minor...I act like they are but they're pretty serious. I just want this baby in my life already. Bottom line....

I've decided to take an incomplete for the semester. But that could change come tomorrow. I'm still sorta behind in school and my toxemia is not getting any better, even though I only have school for a max of 2.5 hrs a day and I rest during the rest of the day. My ankles swell up, and still are...plus everytime I go to school and then the Dr for my appt for bp is through the roof. So I need to see how to work this out so I can complete my assignments at home and still finish the semester. If I can't then I guess I'll be trekking it to Marist everyday; not to mention my internship. God, i don't want to think about that either. 120 hours doesn't seem like a long time but its dragging.

Well, enough complaining from me..I'm just so confused and ready for this baby. It can't come soon enough. Later"

Oh, and its definitely a girl : ) I can't wait to see her chubby cheeked little face!!! I'm supposed to be on bed rest and am already having pre-labor symptoms but they can last a whole month so I'm not sure when labor will happen. Yesterday I finished organizing allllll of the baby stuff---clothes, bath stuff, toys, the diaper and hospital bags. I'm set. Now if she would just get here.

Shaina, I know how you're feeling...I've been in this massively cranky mood lately, but its only towards one person. If you know me, you know I'm talking about my dad. I really wish he would grow up and get his shit together so we would be able to live like a normal family. But NO. On top of his childish state, he's got to fight with all of us, rub it in my face that I'm pregnant and he doesn't plan on helping me one bit, AND he has to run tell all of his dirtbag friends how I'm a ""snitch"" about things. Fuck em. Seriously. I love my dad but the more he screws around the more I get disgusted and just wish he'd leave. It would make us all so much happier. My mom and I keep talking about moving and I really hope that becomes a reality. It's funny, last year before any of this happened with me I was all gung-ho regarding school. Now I'm like...whatever, I'll finish one day, as long as my life isn't chaotic with him around. I'll seriously work 3 jobs to put my child through daycare and stuff so I don't need to worry about where my father is taking my daughter on a daily basis. Not to mention what he's doing when she's around. UGH my life is such a mess, I really need some organization in it. Hopefully soon, hopefully soon. 

Sorry to bum al of ya out but I needed to get this out or I was going to go crazy. I really should update more; then maybe I'll feel better. Later"

"event","So much has gone on this past week..I'm tired. And sad. And mourning. It all started about a week ago, on Friday. I ended my bedrest, yay! but I had more on my mind than my ankles being swelled up. 

My cousin Jennifer, who was due May 15th, was having major complications and ended up being transported to Albany Med because she lost all of the fluid around the baby. I heard from family she was doing alright, just being monitored to make sure the baby was ok. Saturday was my baby shower and I got soooo much stuff. Its hard to believe I have my second one next weekend. Anyways, I spoke to Jenny via phone when I opened her gift and she sounded pretty good. It was hard though because she threw the shower with my mom, and obviously could not be there so the shower was transferred to her mom's house. Sunday came and went...nothing exciting to mention. Monday I had one class and was home by 9:30. We got a phone call around 10 saying Jen had the baby because she was getting a lot of pain so they did an immediate csection. My mom and I were extremely excited and were debating on driving to go see her. Around 11:30 my mom decided to call Jenny's room and see how she was doing and to let her know we were going to come up. I was out of the room but I came back to find my mom crying...the baby died around 11 due to her complications. They had named him Cody and apparently he looked fine...however since the Dr's at Albany Med ended up finding out she was without fluid for a few months, the baby was lying on his umbilical cord and because of that he had irregular brain development. He also ended up having kidney failure before he died. The Dr. said if he did live he would've been mentally retarded or something similar. My mom and I ended up going there anyway because she and her husband needed comfort from the family. It was especially hard for me being pregnant. I wasn't sure how she would react to me being there, and the baby kicking was a constant reminder that I still had what she was looking forward to, and lost. Going up there was a long drive, and seeing Jen made it harder but we all kept it together. Her and her husband Paul showed us pictures of Cody when he was born, in his little incubator with his teddy bear, tubes all over. He was beautiful. It makes me SO incredibly angry that her original OB fucked up and the baby died because she was careless. At least Cody is up in heaven right now, looking down upon us. That makes this a little easier to deal with.

That night after a long and upsetting day I ended up in the Maternity ER with similar complications...but I ended up being alright. False alarm, no fluid was leaking. The rest of the week went by in a blur and its been so tough. Getting ready for the funeral was hard and being so upset, I ended up falling behind on homework plus I had to miss class/test today, and my Drs appt was cancelled. The funeral was this morning which was even more difficult than I could imagine. Jen had just been released from the hospital yesterday and seeing her move around so slowly was difficult, but even more difficult was seeing Cody's casket. Obviously it was the size he was, and so incredibly light in weight. It was white and gold and was beautiful (as beautiful as a casket can be I guess). I couldn't stop crying, thinking how he could have been taken so harshly from this world. Sadly, I'm glad its all over. It's been too hard for me since I'm pregnant..I never thought I would have to see a newborn buried. To keep my mind off of Cody I decided to sleep a lot this afternoon and go through the stuff I got from my shower. I'm doing alright but typing this is hard cause im getting all teary. 

This weekend I have to catch up on my homework; its badly needed. I think I'm going to go to sleep now though. I haven't had much sleep this week. Jen is home for a few months so I'm going to try and keep her company. Hopefully it will be easier for her...now if I could get her to focus more on herself instead of my health problems.....Later guys.

Rest in Peace Cody...February 23, 2004 - February 23, 2004. 
Love, your cousin Lesley."

"event","Its been one hell of a week. UGH. It all started out last Thursday when I came home from school and I was all swollen. I looked like I got beat with a baseball bat in the face and legs (picture the swelling minus the bruises). Anyways, my mom was concerned cause my ankles were the size of my calves and I was getting major pain in the kidney area. So we called the Dr. and I had to go down right away. Come to find out, I have an upper respiratory infection and mild toxemia so I'm on bed rest until this weekend and I can't work. I'm so tired and slacking on the hwmk too, which is really bad cause I've got a test tomorrow and like 4 chapters to read. I've been entertained these past few days by TLC and all of the shows like the baby story, oh yea and I forgot how much lifetime rules. Yesterday I spent all afternoon/night watching lifetime movies with my mom. It was nice to bond with her on the mother/daughter movies, although we already have a fabulous relationship. So in addition to bedrest I'm also on a majorly restricted diet in addition to the diet I'm on already for the gestational diabetes. I can't have any meal with over 400mg of salt which is really hard considering everything is over that. I have tons of fresh fruit and veggies, cereal, water, and juicy juice to eat/drink but its not enough. To make matters worse, TLC has this commercial with Lays potato chips, and even though I rarely eat them this commercial made me sooooo hungry for salty foods. I'm so deprived. But a few more weeks and I can eat whatever I want. Yay. : ) Alright, I'm going to go get some reading done and sleep some before a lifetime movie my mom and I made a date for at 8pm. Ciao : )"

"event","So I got the phone call today that I've been dreading since last Wednesday. My blood sugar came back elevated again which concludes I have gestational diabetes. That explains the need to pee every 20-30 minutes and my excessive thirst and sleepiness. Yuck. It's lots of fun, considering I have to now see a dietary counselor who is going to tell me to stop eating anything and everything with sugars in it. Since I don't eat a lot of sugary foods this is going to be fun. I'm going to be put on a restrictive diet and medication, and more than likely will have to deliver via c-section because the baby gets too large to deliver normally. Proof...I've gained no weight in the past two weeks but my stomach ballooned out...the baby is much heavier *which I know is normal, but aren't I supposed to gain some weight in two weeks? Not even a 1/4 of a pound...hmm. So now my mom is freaking cause I may have to inject insulin everyday and test my blood 4-10 times a day with the finger prick....I HATE the finger prick more than a needle. Ugh, chills down my spine just thinking about it. So that's my fun and exciting Monday. What a way to start off the week...ah well, 10 or less weeks to go and I'm going to be a Mom. That makes this all worth while. I'm gonna go chew on some cardboard for sustenance. Later guys"

"event","Haha so on my way to school this morning I heard that Art Garfunkel was busted in Hurley for marijuana possession. What a loser...he's like 60+ yrs old and he's still getting high? I don't like any type of drug, regardless of what is it or how it makes a person feel. Scratch that---I approve of over-the-counter stuff for surgery and colds and stuff, because they are necessary. But anything else? Nah..I've got better things to spend my time and money on. However, I have many friends who spend all of their time and energy, money, etc on getting high or whatever...I don't like it but its not my life. I'm proud to say I've never tried anything but alcohol. Whatever. Anyways, onto more appropriate things to discuss...

So yea, school started on Tuesday. It was shocking to me cause I thought I had until the 26th, but no..on Saturday at work I found out when looking at the academic calendar/my schedule. I even confirmed it with John to make sure...So needless to say I had a very busy weekend. I worked Saturday, then went shopping at Toys R Us for a baby mattress...came home, had my whole room moved around by my dad/mom/brother (*by the way, thanks for everything guys, love ya!) and then set up my whole room. By 10:30-11pm I was all done and prepared somewhat for the new addition. Sunday I registered at Babies R Us and relaxed w/Dee. Monday was all school business...now its Thursday and I'm exhausted. That terrifies me when I think about all of the stuff I have to do in the next 2 months. Such is life. I love my classes so far and my professors...I even have one who is prego too so she's awesome about me taking 2-3 weeks off. Sweet.

Nothing else is going on in my life...homework to do, sleep to catch up on. Tomorrow I should be getting my glucose test back. I got stuck 6 times for blood...now I'm all bruised. :( I'm gonna go get some work done before my 12:30 class and grab some lunch. Later

PS- Happy 21st Birthday Loren!!! Love you cuz. : )"

"event","Sorry I haven't written in here recently. I began my internship last Monday and between that and my job I put in 44 or 45 hours. I'm so exhausted when I come home and all I end up doing is sleeping..for real. I was in bed at like 9pm most nights. Last night I stayed up until 12 because I was on a cleaning spree. I'm getting rid of junk in my room and my dad and brother are moving everything around so I have room for the crib. I'm getting excited as the time gets closer...but I'm also so incredibly scared. My mom and I went shopping for 4 hours Saturday night..I registered at Toys R Us and then we drove up to Target in Kingston for this bedding I wanted for the crib. Needless to say, they don't have it..and after moping around the aisles in a very pissed off mood, I see the stuff I want on clearance. The thing is, its discontinued and I only got a crib sheet and mobile...so we went back to Toys R Us after spending about $300 in Target and bought a similar ducky bedding I had to settle for. I'm still going to look online cause the Carter's version is so much cuter. Thinking to myself, I must sound like such a loser to everyone who reads this. I'm a 21 yr old who talks about baby bedding when the majority of people my age are out getting trashed at bars and going to clubs. I've experienced all of that and its fun but not for me. I've always been the non-party type to some extent, so I'm not missing out on much. I'm perfectly content with sitting at home watching cartoons with the baby. Anyways, I'm out...lots to do. Bye : )"

"event","Sorry I was so bitter in my last entry guys. It's the holidays that brought me down. I think if I was earlier in the pregnancy it wouldn't have been so bad, but the constant kicking is a reminder of what I chose (which I do not and will never regret) and the fact that Andrew is not with me. It's cool though. I don't need a ""man"" like that. Not much is going on. Start the internship on Monday...still nervous. Today I'm going out to lunch and shopping with my cousin...who is due a month after me. We keep giving each other ideas about stuff to get, etc. It's fun cause she's cool and totally supports me. Anyways, I should get in the shower, lots to do before 11:30 lunch. Later : )"

"event","I hope everyone rang in the new year in a happier mood than I was in. Let me start off by saying I ended up kissing my cat and my parents when the ball dropped. I love my family but New Years Eve needs to be rang in with lots of family, friends, a big party with good food & alcohol, and lots of love. At least that is....according to me. I spent all of NYE cranky and pissed off at the world. I cleaned like a maniac too. But something struck my after eating dinner. I kept thinking about last new year's and how I spent it with Andrew. We had such a good time that year. I went over to his house, hung out with people from high school, and ended up at Deirdre's hotel party where him & I kissed when the ball dropped. That kiss, I think, began everything that led up to where I am today. After that kiss we remained in contact...and hung out all summer. I was mostly upset, not about the kiss, but about the look in his eyes that night. Sitting on his couch, him kinda drunk, excited to talk to me about all of the things going on in our lives. There was a twinkle there that I will never see again. I truly loved him, and last night sucked more than ever because I couldn't spend NYE with the person I love the most. I should be angry with him and I am, but deep down I miss him so much and I wish he was here to tell me it would be alright, that we would do this together and remain together. All of this sparked my big meltdown after dinner, where I just cried and cried and cried. My mom calmed me down and cheered me up, but when it came closer to 12 I was so upset that all I wanted to do was sleep. So, like I said above...I ended up kissing my cat and my parents, and trudged off to sleep. I'm still pretty depressed about it all but I will get through. I just hope everyone had an awesome New Year's Eve and wasn't as miserable as I was. I'm gonna go take a shower and get some stuff done before I go to a family/friend New Years party. Too bad I can't drink. Later"

"event","So last week I worked 37 hours, busted my ass...and for what? A $342 insurance bill. Blah. All of that hard work and look what I get. To make matters worse, work is starting bi-weekly pay beginning tomorrow. And what blows even more, is the fact that I get ONE paycheck before school starts...which must include: car pmt, ins pmt, credit cards (2), and books for school. Riiight, I'm not going to make that much. So whatever I get paid today I need to save for two weeks for gas and my upcoming bills. How can I budget when I am not sure how much I am definitely going to make?? I have less than 3.5 months before this baby gets here and I have sooooo much to buy. I also need to register. So behind. I should be out on Rt 9 right now instead of sitting here, but I really need to vent. Here's another issue. Last night at work I got bitched out by a lower paid snotty ass bitch because she was not happy with my decision. Her branch manager (who makes more than me but was obviously clueless due to our conversation) had to call me and complain because neither of them were happy with my decision. All I need to say is it involved a loan, and I have the authority to override what either of them think. I decided not to make an exception for the FSR and her manager...in turn being yelled at and hung up on. You call my dept for a decision and you get one..don't like it? Kiss my ass. I was pissed off about this for about 2 hrs last night. And the thing is, if I hung up on her for speaking to me in that tone, I would be reprimanded. I'm calling my supervisor today to discuss that situation because I WILL NOT TOLERATE IT. There. I feel better. Now I'm gonna go wash my car and go to the bank. Later"

Next week I begin my internship with the DA's office. I'm excited because I want to go to murder trials and stuff, but I'm scared because I basically am on my own...how am I going to know what to do in a law office for 8 hrs a day!?!?!?!?! I'll let ya'll know once it begins. Anywho...

I hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas. I got a decent amount of stuff since my mom is the only one working (besides me). This year I was more excited to see how everyone reacted to the presents they were given. Although I know I'm still a big kid---I was up at 8am and everyone else got up after 10. Ha. Wait till next Christmas when I'll have an 8 month old. It's gonna be fun : ) So here's what I got:

Tiffany's Heart Tag necklace (from Mom)
Tiffany's Heart Tag bracelet (from Bryan)
clothes
new, bigger, cd rack
Contradiction perfume by CK
dvd's
cds
money
tons of baby clothes from Nina and Cliff
more baby clothes from Mom
down comforter so I am finally warm
stocking stuff like candy, more lipgloss, a musical xmas stuffed animal <---gotta love Mom : )

So I've been pretty tired lately. I'm almost done with my 2nd trimester. Tanya had her twin girls early. My brother's friend just became a dad too. Both of them in the same week. It's making me get more excited for this baby to come. I just have soo much stuff to do before school begins 1/26. Get the crib, reorganize my room, finally buy a car seat and stroller, clean clean clean, fold baby clothes endlessly until they are perfect (or until the baby comes, whichever is first). The baby (which they think is a girl, btw) kicks on a daily basis. It's getting so much stronger..one night it kicked my hand off of my stomach. Ha. I really wish Andrew could be here for this. I need to keep telling myself that he doesn't want to be apart of it---but it just makes me bitter and angry. 

I'm pretty depressed about New Year's Eve. Last year I spent it with him and a few friends. We kissed when the ball dropped. This year it will be me, my family, and my cat. Ha Shadow can have a kiss. What a bummer. Anyways, I'm gonna go hop in the shower and maybe score lunch with Nina. It's either lunch or dinner. Now how much do ya'll want to bet we're going to Olive Garden??? : )"

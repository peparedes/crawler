-drown yourself in music and just hope for the best
-what you lack in heart, you make for in insincerity
-tell me doctor how to shake a waking nightmare that is only worse when i am sleeping
-excuse me while i fall apart. dont flatter yourself sweetheart.
-when i ask 'will this be ending?' how quickly lust can pretend its love.
-love rhymes with pity now
- we need to pretend that we are in love again

-because how i ever got to you, i have no idea. it's like some secret door, well it just appeared. so, no matter what i do from now on with my time, you will always stay here, in my mind. i am certain of this, and i am not certain of anything."

""The Night Will Go As Follows""

In a romantic fashion 
I will experiment with my fear right before her eyes 
And every smile that's unveiled will be soaked 
In my nervous charm 

Then I'll say 
""Is everything alright? 
There's been a few things I've been meaning 
To let go of tonight"" 
And she will say 
""Everything's just fine 
So you can put an end to your worrying mind"" 
And then our lips will collide 

The August sky will then bare witness 
To a brand new chapter with torn up pages 
When the planets align, I can feel the gates opening 
To my courage 
As I proceed to run my fingers through her hair 
And forget everyone who's jaded, 'cause they don't matter 
And I don't care 

In a confident fashion 
I will admit my deepest and darkest to her 
And every gaze across the table 
Will send my unsuspecting body into shock 

Then I'll say 
""Would you like to go inside? 
And forget the world and the rules 
By which we are to abide"" 
And she will say 
""There's nothing I want more"" 
As we step into the room, turn off the lights and close the door 

The August sky will then bare witness 
To a brand new chapter with torn up pages 
When the planets align, I can feel the gates opening 
To my courage 
As I proceed to run my fingers through her hair 
And forget everyone who's jaded, 'cause they don't matter 
And I don't care 
No, 'cause they don't matter 
And I don't care 

Brash and hopeful 
That my luck will not perish tonight 
When the overcast tries to kill me 
It's your slow motion rain 
That falls warm on my neck that keep me alive 

Brash and hopeful 
That my luck won't perish tonight 
And when the overcast tries to kill me 
It's your slow motion rain 
That falls warm on my neck that keep me alive 

Brash and hopeful 
That my luck will not perish tonight 
And when the overcast tries to kill me 
It's your slow motion rain 
That falls warm on my neck that keep me alive 

Consider this song a testament 
Of my devotion to your sacharrine scent 
And to be completely honest 
You're not like all the rest 
You're not like all the rest 

Consider this song a testament 
Of my devotion to your sacharrine scent

""All Hail The Heartbreaker""

<b>I had the notion that you'd make me change my ways </b>
<i>My bad habits would be gone in a matter of days</i> 
I had the feeling that you'd open up my eyes 
To a whole new world that had since been in disguise 

But that day will most likely never come for me 
<b>And it's just my luck to end up getting stuck </b>
<strike>To everything you are </strike>

So tonight I'll sit and pick apart your pictures 
<b>And overanalyze your words </b>
But the truth is that <i>I've never fallen so hard</i> 
It's taking everything in me 
Just to forget your sweater so far 

I had the notion that you'd make me forget the world 
But your undecisive mind shows me that 
You are ""just another <strike>girl</strike> <b>boy</b>"" 
I had the feeling that those looks you gave me were real 
What if I <b>ripped</b> your<i> heart apart at the seams </i>
Maybe then you'd know how I feel 

I can honestly say 
<i>That I never, ever, ever felt this way </i>
Your<b> lips</b>, your <b>eyelashes</b>, your <b>skin</b> 
These are the parts of your body 
That cause<u> my comatose </u> to begin 

I will sleep another day 
I don't really need to anyway 
What's the point when<i> my dreams are infected</i> 
With words you used to say 
I will breathe in a <b>moment </b>
As long as I keep my distance 
<u>I wouldn't want to go messing anything up </u>

So don't go worrying about me 
It's not like I think about you constantly 
So maybe I do, but that shouldn't affect 
Your life anymore 
I knew it the moment you walked into the door 

So don't go worrying about me 
It's <b>not like</b> I think about this <i>constantly</i> 
So <u><b>maybe I do</b></u>, but that shouldn't affect 
Your life anymore 
I knew it the moment you walked into the door 

<b>I'll let you get the best of me</b> 
Because there's<i> nothing else that I do well </i>
I'll let you get the best of me 
I'll be the <u>giver</u> and you'll be the <u>taker</u> 
You've got me <b>down on my knees</b> and I proclaim
A l l  [hail] the [h e a rt -b r e a k e r]

I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(A notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
Is this more than you bargained for yet
Oh don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song

As we're <b>sparkling and twirling in the twilight </b>
<u>And after three long years, I think that we both need this</u> 
So we seal the deal in the parking lot with a kiss 

And in case you 
And in case you were wondering, you are like a sunset to me 
You're all kinds of beautiful as you end my day 
And you sweetly retire as stars chase you away 

I'd collapse to the grass, with your notes ringing in my head 
Let the rain fill my mouth, and in a couple hours I'll be dead 
But all the while my lips are whistling our tune 
But the beauty lies in how you will revive me soon

G-Unit in the house yeah that's my clique 
Yeah I'm young but a nigga from the old school, 
On a dance floor nigga doing old moves... 
I don't give a fuck I do what I wanna do, 
I hit your ass up boy I done warned you, 
Better listen when I talk nigga don't trip, 
Your heat in the club, mine's in this bitch, 
I ain't tryin' to beef I'm tryin' to get my drink on. 
I got my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on.. 
I'm gonna kick it at the bar til it's time to go, 
Then I'm gonna get shorty here and I'm gonna let her know...

All a nigga really need is a lil bit,

Eyes a little low cuz I twist tha dro 
Pockets on swoll cuz I move the o's.. 
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze 
Come get your bitch she on me dawg, 
She must a heard about the dough, 
Now captain c'mon and save a hoe. 

I get crunk in the club I'm off the chain 
#1 on the chart all the time mayne 
When the kid in the house I turn it out 
Keep the dance floor packed that's without a doubt 
Shorty shake that thing like a pro mayne 
She back dat up on me I'm like oh man

System thumpin' party's jumpin I say it loud and clear.

You're sad when it's over but you're glad you had
<strike>That moment that moved you deep inside</strike>
Beautiful goodbye,baby goodbye
I enjoyed the ride,we really had us a time
It's a strange kind of high

Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrop
I am the sea
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
<b>Baby, I'm so proud</b>
So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

<b>And I know you love me
Love me for who I am</b>
Cause years before I became who I am
Baby you were my man
I know it ain't easy
Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny
I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you
sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful
To have you by my side

Every time I see your face 
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love and to hold
To feel
To breathe
To love you

and the places that you go 
When the lights are turned down low 
and I don't understand all the things you've seen 
but I'm slipping in between 
<b>You and your big dreams 
It's always you 
In my big dreams </b>
And you tell me that its over 
wake up lying in a patch of four leaf clovers 
and your restless 
and im naked 
you gotta get out 
you cant stand to see me shakin 
no 
<i>could u let me go? 
i didnt think so </i>
and you dont wanna be here in the future 
so you say the presants just a pleasant interuption to the past 
and you dont wanna look much closer 
cause ur afriad to find out all this hope 
you had sent into the sky by now had 
crashed 
and it did 
because of me 

and then you bring me home 
afraid to find out that your alone oh 
and im sleeping in your living room 
but we dont have much room to live 

and i had these dreams in them i learned to play guitar 
maybe cross the country 
become a rock star 
and there was hope in me that I could take you there 
but damnit you're so young 
well i dont think i care 
and if i hurt you 
then im sorry 
please dont think that this was easy 

and then you bring me home 
cause we both know what its like to be alone oh 
and im dreaming in your living room 
but we dont have much room to live 

and konstantine is walking down the stairs 
doesnt she look good 
standing in her underware 
and i was thinking 
what i was thinkin 
we've been drinkin and it doesnt get me anywhere 
my konstantine came walking down the stairs 
and all that i could do was touch her long blond hair 
and ive been thinkin 
but it hurts me thinking 
that these nights when we were drinking 
no they never got us anywhere 
no 

this is because i can spell confusion with a 'K' 
and i can like it 
its to dying in anothers arms 
and why i had to try it 
its to jimmy eat world 
and those nights in my car 
when the first star you see 
may not be a star 
im not your star 
isnt that what you said 
what you thought this song meant 

and if this is what it takes 
just to lye with my mistakes 
and live with what i did to you 
all the hell i put you through 
i always catch the clock 
its 11:11 
now you wanna talk 
its not hard to dream 
you'll always be my konstantine 
my konstantine 
they'll never hurt you like i do 
no they'll never hurt you like i do 
no,no,no, no, no, no, no, no 

this is to a girl 
who got into my head 
with all the pretty things she did 
hey 
ya know 
you keep me up in bed 
this is to a girl 
who got into my head 
with all these fucked up things i did 
hey 
maybe 
baby you could keep me up in bed 
my konstanine 

you spin around me like a dream 
we played out on this movie screen 
and i said 
did u know i missed you(x7) 
i miss you 

and then you bring me home 
and we go to sleep 
but this time not alone 
and i know 
and you'll kiss me in your living room 
i know 
i know you miss me in your living room 
cuz these nights i think 
maybe that i miss you in my licing room 
but we dont have much room 
i said does anybody need that room 
because we all need a little more room

February 18 - March 19
Things may get a bit rough for you, dear Pisces, during the next few weeks, especially in the department of love and romance. You are likely to find that adjustments need to be made in your behavior in order for you to sync up with the people around you. Your powers of adaptation will be put to the test, but this is certainly nothing that you can't handle. Give your heart the respect it needs.
okay..so i am a pisces...what does this mean? is that great friend of mine is going to make my life a pain for a little while?
well ne who..i am going to be dog sitting this weekend and get the place to myself...so i would like to be like heeeeeeeeeeeeey...come chill...hott mango...woot woot..and i would also like to do that whole chillin with the girls thing...and i wanna see high tension...well i need to remember to call alexa..and leanne..keep forgetting to do that...

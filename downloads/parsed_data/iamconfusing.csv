"event","Happiness?

Happiness is a state of mind.  How can you be in a certain state of mind if you mind doesn't even know what that state necessarily means.


All emotions flood back and forth, and all I hope for is some control.


But somehow the control I imagine and hope for will never come.




I'll just have to get used to living in this body, not in control, and as this minion.


Everyone sees who they want to see, but that doesn't necessarily mean they see <i>me</i>.


I want change, I want something different but all I see is this odd person, and I'm the only one who see it.  It's invisible to others."

"event","What is it about me that you find is so easy to judge?
I don't understand why you say some of what you say.  It's so hard to comprehend why you just judge, and judge and judge.  Usually I wouldn't care, but what bothers me is when you say you <I>don't</i> judge.  

And you wonder why I get so defensive.  

With all that you say to me and how much you judge me I wonder what you would say to me if you only knew everything I thought, and all that I actually deal with.  If you only realized that my life isn't as simple as it seems, it's not black and white, I don't just sleep, go to school, go to work.  I do more than that.  I do a lot.  I have feelings.  And I have thoughts that are worth more than your shut downs and the disrespect you shoot at them.  So in actuality I don't own you anything.  I'd like to think that we're even.

A clean conscience/slate, would be wonderful.  No worries, no problems, just simple day to day events.  But it's so unlikely, and I wouldn't change a thing because of all that everyone around me teaches me, I learn to value all that I have and what opportunities I have.  These 'things' as you might call them that I have allow me to want to make change and make an impact.

While not being annoying.


Wish List:
1. Not be annoying
2. Make an impact and/or make change
3. Live my dream
4. Gain your respect
5. Gain control of myself
6. Have a good <i>nights</i>
7. Have fun
8. Not take things too seriously
9. Succeed at my main goal that no one knows
10. To not disappoint"

I keep on walking for what seems like forever.  I come to a fork in the road and don't know which way to go.  I go to the tree that is directly in the middle that is big and lively and sit down.

And then I open my eyes."

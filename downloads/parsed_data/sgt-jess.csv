"event","-----Finally, some good clean humor. . . . .
It is hard to find a joke without a dirty word or two in it. Here is one with none: 
Two tall trees, a birch and a beech, are growing in the woods. A small tree begins to grow between them, and the beech says to the birch, ""Is that a son of a beech or a son of a birch?"" The birch says he cannot tell. Just then a woodpecker lands on the sapling. The birch says, ""Woodpecker, you are a tree expert. Can you tell if that is a son of a beech or a son of a birch?"" The woodpecker takes a taste of the small tree. He replies, ""It is neither a son of a beech nor a son of a birch. It is, however, the best piece of ash I have ever put my pecker in."""

"event","Me and the old man went to Great Adventure on saturday, We bought season passes for all of us (Tim,Richard and me) now we can go anytime we are board with PA. We bought them this year because we do not have the money to go to the shore (I hate the shore) Tim and Richard only go to ride the rides anyways. So this is our vacation this year however we can go every weekend for a couple of hours and Tim wants to take Richard on week days after he get home from work.  It will be fun! The good thing is as long as it is just Tim and I going with Richard I don't have to ride the roller coasters because someone has to stay with Richard he is only 40"" tall HA! HA! even if we bring someone I still have to stay with Richard unless he grows a 14"" in the next few months and that is not going to happen."

"event","Today Richard and I worked on removing the wallpaper in the bathroom! Richard was a ""really big Help"" He First sprayed the wall with water. Then he decided the it was more fun to scrape the wall. I figured what the hell if the gouged the wall I will have to spackle it oh well. We took the mirror off the wall and to my surprise the is a big hole in the wall that has been wallpaper over. Here was my dilemma we are going to put a mirror back up do I fix the wall or leave it? well I made lunch for Richard and I and then I went up the the bathroom and staring at me is the big hole so of course I had to fix it. So now I is in the process of being spackle. 
Then I'm getting ready for work and I get a call from the lady from the IEU testing place (I was going to have a meeting with them tomorrow) but they canceled. She said she would call with a new date. 
I get to work today and Joanne also cancels are girls day out. She has to study that is more important than shopping so I understand. She said I could go with her for a ""girl's party"" in a couple weeks It sounded fun.
Now I'm at work, they started a outbound program calling members of the program now we are getting calls that are transfered for the degenerates they hired who know nothing about the program and have no idea how to transfer calls. Not to mention all the people who have called in to say there loved one a passed on. The calls are very crazy. 
All I want to do is read Harry Potter. But they Keep calling. I know it's my job but most of the time I don't have to work. Alot the calls could have been taken care of by the first person who called these poor people.  
I can't wait for nine o'clock 
1 lunch time
2 outbound calling stops and stupid people stop transferring calls to us."

Okay Saturday we took richard to the light show at great advencer it was really nice however at the end you can get out a walk around this holiday village with a kid maze and shops, well we did not dress for getting out and walking around in the cold so we did not see much we were there long enough for Richard to get mom mom to but him a light up stick. (he already took it apart and I had to put it together) On sunday christal, Richard and I went to see the Cat In The Hat the movie was good however the was way to much ""pre show"" entrainment including the rude lady who was letting her kid kick the back of my chair."

"event","Happy Wednesday, Tomorrow is Turkey Day. yeah no work 
This morning when I got home from work Richard coughing nonstop so I woke him up to give cough medicine then he did not go back to sleep until 3:30am or later (I fell asleep at 3:30am)

8:30am We wake up to my damn cell phone going off. Richard goes upstairs with mom mom and I go up a little later Richard turns to me and said ""mom mom is crazy"" mom mom asked ""Why am I crazy"" Richard Looks at me and goes ""see what I mean!!""
    
Okay today Richard was off of school with means Chris and me had to take Richard on our walk today. Now Richard loves Chris and talks to her non stop. Chris decided to tell Richard that the Ninja Turtles live under man hole covers and jumps on the man hole cover and said ""wake up"" Now Richard loves the idea of being able to boss someone around. So every man hole cover we pass he goes ""Jump on it Christal.""
Then Richard gets cold on our walk so I get the Elmo blankey and wrap him up in it. he looks like a mummy now it is my job to tell Chris to jump on the man hole covers. Not only that he yells at me did we pass a man cover every 30 sec chris and I both say not yet And then Richard goes well you have to tell to jump on it.
Next Chris Richard and me went to the smoke store and Wal-Mart. Richard is kind of like Joanne and will talk to anyone and everyone in the smoke store he talk to a old guy named Frank and was asking why he was scratching his lottery ticket in the store. In Wal-Mart he asked this old lady in a wheelchair why she was in the wheelchair and what her name is the old lady replied Theresa and goes my name is Richard.
then we are taking Chris back home and he asked her are you going to have a baby? Chris is like ""not right now"" and he asked ""what would you name your baby, Richard??"" Chris goes ""but we already have a Richard, you."" Chris said ""I like the name Tyler for a boy."" Richard replies ""but I already have a Tyler in my class."" Chris said ""well if I had a girl I like the name Savannah"" Richard goes ""I like the name Amanda."" Chris said ""well I like Savannah"" Richard goes ""no Amanda works"" well that is my day with Richard."

"event","This year for Christmas I suggested to Rich Jr that we get Bert a new T.V.  We could go half'er on it. She does need one well bastard decided to go and tell Bert that we were going to buy her a T.V. Wtf Now I don't even want to go through it because it will not be a surprise. (But I have Too) She might as well get it the day we buy it. Set it up and everything then on Christmas when everybody is opening gifts she can just watch. I find Christmas not to be as fun if you know what you are getting ahead of time. 
One year my sister made me open my gifts and she opened hers she did this so I would not tell on her. I would be in just as much trouble as she would be. Needless to say when we did get to open presents on Christmas Eve it was not as much fun. It's kinda like the first year after you decide Santa is just your parents! What a bummer of a Christmas well I don't hope for Bert to have a bummer of a Christmas but that is what she will get"

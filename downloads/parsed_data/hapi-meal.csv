She's already worried bout her dad and then she doesn't know what's happening between her ""maybe-baby-boyfriend"" and herself! now as a friend i feel bad because I hate seeing her this way and there's so little I could do. I know just the person who could cheer her up but he's too far out of my reach. This person has cheered her up so many times in the past. No matter what the situation is, but i guess this time he's not one of the options. Hell, i dont even know if its over between them! Grrrr... oh well i guess me and allen are just gonna do the cheering up. anyways my baby is calling me now. I think he's burnt the food!"

Her heart for some reason just stopped beating. It's like I still don't want to accept the fact that she's gone. Now who's gonna be with me on my wedding day!? (cries).
But hey life goes on.. im pretty sure she'd still be there. I miss her already."

Just tell me who wouldn't freeze or get sick from that? 
Now she copped a prize... she's sick! the poor thing.
U see sometimes when she's trippin or upset she just doesn't think. She'll do the first thing that pops in her head! and i bet she wouldn't even take medicine.

"event","4 and a half years ago I was a certified computer geek. Always online chatting to friends and meeting tons of people all over the world. I still remember when i first started chatting to this person from the other side of the planet. We 'clicked' faster than u can blink! He was based in Boston while I was here in Melbourne. Our casual 'chats' turned into phone calls. Oh his name's Joseph by the way or U can call him 'yoshi' (dun ask why). 

I remember when he told me over the fone that he's coming down to australia to meet me. And boy I was so thrilled! I had mixed emotions of excitement and at some point got a bit scared. Imagine someone you've never met before is now flying over halfway across the world to see u! I bet you'd feel nervous too. Funny coz he didn't even tell me when he's coming. He took me by surprise. I was out shopping with a friend in the city when my fone rang, so i answered it and it was him telling me that he's now im melbourne. I nearly fainted haha! So he asked where i am and he came to meet me at Cafe Luisa in the city. It was the most memorable night of my life! A year a few months later of being together i was shocked when he decided to move here in Melbourne. And i couldnt say no lol.. 

Now 4 years and a half later.. we are gettin married!! can u believe it? I still cant! lol. It was such a thrill. U see long distance relationship CAN work. It is tough but that's why u got each other for support in times of frustrations.. It aint that bad at all. In the end everything's worth the wait and definitely worth the try."

"event","It is one thing to speak what you feel and quite another to speak what you feel without regard to the consequences of the pain that might accompany your words when spoken hastily to your bf/gf..
The words we express allow us to predict the predicaments that will occur in our relationships. It is wise to be careful of the words we think. Thinking them becomes a dress rehearsal for what we can expect to happen. Speaking them activates the law of cause and effect.

On the other hand, the words of encouragement, of understanding, of love, or any words that echo good will always elevate us to their own level. That is most likely a higher place than where we began. As often as you can, speak only words of love.
Relationships don't die by themselves. We kill relationships with inappropriate words -- words from the head, not from the heart. 

You win or lose with the words you choose!
(Is that right or is that right?)."

"event","""When to let go?"" is one the few question a person may ask.. hmm.. not that im tryin to let go of someone in my life, no. I'm perfectly happy with everything at the moment. Thought I'd post this for a friend who's in a situation where he can never win.. and he knows that. (Yes dude! im talkin to u haha.. *ALLEN*)

Imagine this. In your hand is a very precious 
creation, so fragile, so  valuable that if you 
keep on holding, it would either stay or fall 
apart. But you loved this creature so much, so 
much that letting it go would be like letting go 
of your life as well. So much that sometimes you 
wished it would be there forever. So much that 
you tend to be selfish at times so as you could 
make it stay for as long as you like. Don't we 
all wish something ""so good"" could be forever? 
Don't we all hope that happiness is there to 
stay?


There comes a time in our lives when we chance 
upon someone ""so nice"" and ""almost perfect"" and 
we just find ourselves getting so intensely 
attracted to that person (sometimes without even 
realizing it). This feeling soon become a part 
of our everyday lives and eventually guzzles our 
thoughts and actions to the extent that we tagged 
it as one of those ""too good to be true"" thing.


The sad part there is when we begin to realize 
that, this particular person feels totally 
nothing but friendship. A ""thing"" that would be 
forever a ""thing"" nothing more, nothing 
less...just a thing! You're just a friend, And 
that's the fact! Then in our desperate attempt 
to get closer (or at least Be noticed), our 
efforts are still futile and we end up sorry for 
ourselves. 


One person said, never ever let your heart run 
your life, as much as you can, always be 
sensible and let your mind speak for itself. Try 
to listen not merely on what your feelings is 
invoking on you as a person but more importantly 
listen to reason as well.


Letting go of someone doesn't necessarily mean 
you have to stop loving, it only means that you 
allow that person to find their own happiness 
without expecting them to come back. Letting go 
is not just setting the other person free (in the 
real sense of it), but it is also setting 
yourself free from all animosity, revulsion, and 
resentment that was long kept in your heart. You 
have to let go because the bitterness often puts 
away the strengths and weakens the littlest 
hope, making our lives more miserable than ever. 
Worst, presenting yourself as the ""most affected 
one"" sets the nastiest impression of all time--
whatta a loser!


The trick there is...always remember that if you 
lose someone today, it means that someone better 
is coming tomorrow.

If you lose love that doesn't mean that you 
failed in love...right? Just regard it as 
another mismatch of heaven! Well, you can cry of 
course, or whine or shout (growl even) if you 
have to, but make sure that after those outbursts 
you have washed away the hurt and the bitterness 
that the past Has left with you (easy said than 
done I know!). 


We can all survive with just beautiful memories 
of the past but real peace and happiness come 
only with open acceptance of what reality is 
today. You really don't have to forget someone 
you love ('cause it's hard). What we need to 
learn is how to accept the verdict of reality 
without being bitter or sorry for what we have 
become. I think it's better that we give off 
that dedication and love to someone more 
deserving. Hmmm...""Who could it be"" is the next 
interesting question to ponder. Let go of 
yesterday and love will find its wayback to you. 
And when it does, pray hard that it may be the 
love that will stay and last a lifetime. 

...damn! that was a long post wasnt it?"

But due to some mood changes, we ended up goin to the casino and gambling instead! Mind you im not a gambler so i needed some convincing. But yeah due to CC's persistent nagging (as usual) and being the 'nice' friend that i am i agreed to go to the casino instead. We played pokies! damn machines they eat your money like there's no tomorrow! But we got lucky first off.. we put $20 in and we won a $100!!! wee!! then we had dinner and talked for ages! It was good though. I made my friend cry (just a lil), she's just in a really emotional state at the moment. But i hope i made her feel even just a bit better. Funny thing was when we sat at the car park (yes we sat there! not in the car lol), there were these idiots beaming their laser lights at her, and u know wat she did??? She gave em the fingers and told em to fcuk off!!! haha.. now that was really funny we ended up laughin for ages. Anyway i can feel my eyes shuttin down now so i better get goin.

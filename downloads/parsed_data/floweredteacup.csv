"event","I'm on the phone with Sash now. I feel more depressed than I've felt in a long time. My mother told me today that my dad got a job offer in New Zealand and he's thinking about moving there. I cried in the car. Then, mom and I were talking about dinner. She had said yesterday that we might be able to go to Pio's. But then she realized Boo's dad went out of town, so we couldn't. Then I asked if I could go to a movie. No. Then she told me we could rent movies. We didn't. Then I could have Sash over. I couldn't. She's at her cousin's. And then tomorrow she has two play things. All day. So I'll only get to see her at Dragonfly. Though, I know the moment I do, everything'll just be forgotten. Problems just go whoosh down the drain when she hugs me.. Though she doesn't usually. I hug her. I doubt this entry will make her feel better, seeing as my mood has affected hers, which I'm sorry for. I'm just tired, and menstral, and a series of unfortunate events has just clouded over today. I don't know why it drives me wild, but having my plans ruined gets me down. I get my hopes up, only to get soaked when someone rains on my parade. No umbrella. Which is my fault, but still.

We're going to Busch Garden's Howl-O-Scream Saturday. I'm afraid. Bri said something about chainsaws and loud noises. *shudders* Sash's a pansy, though, so she can't be my knight in armour. I still love her dearly, though, don't fret. God, I do love her. I needed her so much tonight, but yeah.. I'm not going to dwell on it seeing as I've upset her enough. Anyway, it's getting on one am, I said I'd go to bed at midnight. So much for that. Good night."

I know you won't get this till later, but G'mornin', Sunshine. Anyway. I cooked dinner for the past two nights. Tuesday was Orange Roughy encrusted in seasoned bread crumbs with a lemon-y sauce. And last night was ""Beef medalions with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce"". It was okay, apparently. I'm happy. I wore the skirt Bri forced me to buy yesterday. We went to the mall to be shopping and stuff. oo; I got a dress, a necklace, two shirts and a skirt. I didn't want it, but Bri was like ""You have to!"" So I did. I like it, actually. >> It makes my hips and bum look nice. oo; Oh, and I found coolies pirate boots (Bri won't let me use hers --;), but they were pleather and really hot.. And Debby said that I shouldn't, so I think I'll go with my mom and ask her what she thinks. I hope I can get my eyebrows done and get my haircut today.

Uhm. Went to Pio's tonight with Bri, Mom, and Bob. It was so much fun. OMG was it fun. We had an air-blowing contest, and I tried to teach my mom the thing Sash taught me, with the corks, but she couldn't get it. And then we were talking with water in our mouths and she spit it everywhere.. Bob I think was embarrassed.. But I've never had that much fun.

I don't know what to think anymore. I don't feel as close to Will as I used to.. I'm trying, but it just doesn't come. I mean, I don't want this thing between us to die.. Because I love him, and he loves me.. And he makes me feel.. I can think of him at any time and get a smile.. He makes me feel.. Wonderful. I've made him cry, I've made him cut, I've made him sick to his stomach, but still he refuses the idea that I'm no good for him. Still he wants me. Still he loves me.. I think if I ever met him.. I'd kill myself before leaving. :/ He absolutely adorable, the way he stumbles while he talks, his 'wiff', the sudden 'tell me you love me's, the way he'll go silent if I say the right thing, the way I know when he's smiling, the way he knows me, the way he'll repeat stories over again.. No one's ever wanted me so much.. I don't think.

Blinking and blinking. And the people. They don't care if I'm there or not. Sash says 'oh, they do'. But darin', I can tell. They dont. Dan's not as nice as I thought. The Kelsey's are.. But.. Yeah.

Okay, so, we get there, and like, I'm fucking exhausted 'cause I was up all night before, and the cramped sleep on the plane didn't help AT ALL. Anyway, so, we're there and we're just doin' the normal check in stuff yadda- OMG. There was this 80 year old lady on the plane and she had to be like.. A fucking millionare. She was staying at the best place in Las Vegas, and she had a Gucci back and hat, and I'm willing to bet her shoes were from another one of those expensive stores. Mhmm. Yep. She was staying at the Bellagio. It's so fucking pretty. They have a big lakey-thing, that has fountain shows and stuff.. Yeah. She was a sweetheart - that lady. She said I was lovely and well brought up. :3 Made me happy. And then.. Oh right. Then we walked to the mall in the Bellagio (the hotels have malls) and went to Le Cirque for dinner. SP. Was the best thing I've ever eaten. @.@; I got.. Smoked salmon plate and the veal. Mmn. <3 Okay, so then we have to take a cab back 'cause it was like three blocks and I decided to wear spikey-heeled strapped sandals and got 6 blisters, to be exact. Mhmm. So then, the next day, we walk an even farther distance to the Ventician, A FUCKING AWESOME HOTEL WITH A CANNAL IN IT! OMGOMGOMG. And there was this wax museum where you could sing to a statue of Simon (American Idols) and he would tell you what he thought.. Yeah.. It was something like Madame So-n-So's Interactive Museum of Wax. Didn't do it, though. Didn't have time. And we went to this comsetics store that had EVERYTHING.. And I got make-up. :D And then we got charicatures.. And stuff. Mkay. So we stayed in the Monte Carlo. It was nice. I wasn't allowed to watch the gambling even.. Though I sat at a slot machine to spite them. :) Hmm.. And then we went to see Bob's parents, and had dinner at this Italian restaurant called Bucca diBeppo. It was nice. Had Carbonarra. <3 Mmmn. Heart attack on a plate. And then, the next day, we went to the Hoover Dam.. And that was just a big fiasco. I definately DON'T like the Hoover Dam. It was cool though, 'cause they were in the middle of a really bad draught, and half the water was gone. We had dinner at this place called The Eiffle Tower Restuarant. It was awesome. We could see everything. It was on the Eiffle Tour built for Paris (the hotel in Vegas, not the city in France). I have the (big surprise) smoked salmon and some beef and fois gras. Then, for dessert, I had a banana souflle (SP), and it turned into my all-time favorite dessert. x.x Mkay.. Then the last day we walked to Caeser's Palace. They had the biggest mall EVER. I bought most stuff there. >> Two new skirts, two tops, two sets of undergarments, shoes, perfume.. Etc. I wanted a purse, too, and it was only $148 (VERY cheap for this mall.. It had stuff like Georio Armani, Gucci, Prada, etcetc.), but she wouldn't let me 'cause I already bought so much stuff. :D Then we had dinner at this place called Spago, owned by Wolfgang Puck, and I had smoked salmon and the bass."

"event","WOW. Today was fucking long. Go to school, yadda, yadda. Then me, my mom, and Maggie (we were giving her a ride home) went around to look at a house my mom placed a bid on. OMFG. BEAUTIFUL. White picket fence, with roses growing on it. Mmn. And.. DUNDUNDUN. $10,000 STAIN-LESS STEEL HOT TUB AND HEATED POOL WITH OUTDOOR SPEAKERS.*CACKLE* Yeah, anyway. I really want to move in there. @.@ And then we got home, I watched a little Angel, and then Bob sticks his head into the living room and is like ""ready to go?"" I'm like ""go where?"" So yeah. That gave me two minutes to get out of my slump-clothes and swipe another layer of mascara on. Oof. Then we're at the restaurant, and my mom orders champagne, raises a glass, and goes ""to our new house!"" My jaw dropped. We got the house! And then, we decided Travis would rent it for a year, and then we'd move in. I'm so excited. Mhmm. So that's the day's events. Not much, but it wore me out. Travis and my mom are gonna go clubbing at midnight. Let's see if she lasts. I'm putting my money on the senario that she falls asleep at her desk while working on her brief (like she said she'd do to keep awake)."

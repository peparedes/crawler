That color them wonderful
Stop me and steal my breath
Emeralds from mountains
Thrust towards the sky
Never revealing their depth

Tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, 
I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows 
Of heartache that hang from above

I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

As we lie awake in my bed
You're my survival
You're my living proof
My love is alive and not dead

Burned up
Fought my way back from the dead
Tuned in
Turned on
Remembered the things you said

I know it's hard to feel like I don't care at all.
Where you are and how you feel.
Put these lights off as these wheels
keep rolling on and on. (and on and on and on...)
Slow things down or speed them up.
You're running now for way too much. (and on and on and on...)
Or you are not gone.

And I can't make it on my own.
(And I can't make it on my own.)
Because my heart is in Ohio.

So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
So I can fall asleep tonite and die.
Because you kill me.
You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.

Spare me just three last words.
""I love you"" is all she heard.
I'll wait for you, but I can't wait forever."

I relate to you naturally

Tyler-- Your guna be leaving me in 12 days and I think I'm about the saddest I could ever be =/. You dont understand how much you mean to me. I'm seriously so lucky to have you. There are NO words to express how I feel for you. I once thought I was in love turned out to be lust. With you I KNOW that its love. I wouldnt trade you for ANY other guy. You know what to say to make me happy wen I'm sad and you can always make me laugh. I dont know whats guna end up happening with us, but I hope that its all for the best. If I had my choice youd be staying here with me and then wen I graduate we could go to college together, but unfortunatly its not up to me. When I'm with you I have no worries or fears... everything is perfect. I could care less about anything else..you come first ALWAYS. Your more then just my boyfriend you are my bestfriend. And if we dont end up together later on in life just know that I did love you with all of my heart and please dont forget about me. Its like this is it..this is where we find out what the truth is about us. In the end no matter what I want to be with you. I can honestly say I found my one and only. I LOVE YOU<3."

I acctually somewhat get football now and I like watching it. I missed Tyler SO much it was CRAZY. The way I feel for him is so hard to describe. I've never liked a guy anywhere as near as much as I like Tyler. If I didnt have him in my life well I wouldnt have a life at all bc he IS my life. I would do anything for him and pick him over pretty much anyone. I can tell him things and I know hes not guna go off and tell like stupid girls do. I love being able to kiss him and hug him whenever I want to. I get SO excited when I see him. I hope he means I love you when he says it bc I know I do.

I stayed with Lauren last night and Madi and Jen stayed too. It was fun. We just kinda sat in her room and talkd about everything. Those girls are SO funny and fun to be around. I hope we hang out again soon. =]"

I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I wanna sleep with you forever
And I wanna die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

I wanna honor your mother
I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better than it's ever been

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Comin' your way

I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits but it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you with a warm, wet kiss

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us
I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you

"event","No words can describe love, or the way that one person makes you feel.
It's when they call you, when your heart skips that beat, and you want to know how their day went.
When you hear their footsteps walking to your door, and you realize that everytime you hear that, you smile.
It's when you are sitting in a room with them, and when they get up to leave, you can just feel the absence of someone.
It's when you can just sit in the car for an hour or so, with just silence, and KNOW that everything is perfect.
Whether one night you go to the movies and dinner, or stay at home in your pj's and just talk, spending time with them is the one thing in life you look forward to.
It's when you get in a fight, you always make things right before you go to sleep. Because if you don't , than you won't be able to sleep.
It's when you realize the arguments in the relationship, make it stronger, and after you fight.. you just want to hold them.
Whenever you can brag about them to your friends, even though you know they don't want to hear what you have to say, but you HAVE to tell someone how you feel.
When the small things you do for each other, are the ones that make you smile, laugh, and cry.. all at the same time.
When they call you at the most inoppurtune time, but it makes you feel good because you know they are thinking about you.
Just seeing them can make your day, and just hearing them can make you smile.
When they treat you the same way around their friends, as if they would when you are alone, not because they feel obligated to.. but because they want to.
When you want to know more about them .. always.
They aren't just someone you are falling hopelessly in love for, they are your best friend.
Someone you can tell everything to, and they can respond with honest feelings.
Love is something that touches everyone.. and puts an impression on each person in a different way.
There is no definition to love, because everyone loves in different ways."

Not much to really say about what I've done latley bc I have done abosloutley nothing!  I got to see Tyler everyday this weekend and stayed with Madi Friday and Saturday night. My mom got me 2 belts, flip-flops, and some jewlry from Frisco =].. I was happy about that. I realllly LOVE Tyler even more now.  He has a canoe trip with just Seniors this weekend... gahlee I'm guna be SO worried..I'll prbly worry myself sick =/. I think I'm going to Frisco to find my Sports Banquet dress =]..I'm excited and I think Madi is coming with me so thats a plus. Only 4 days this week..yiaay =D!  I havent talked to Sydnie really latley. I guess we arent much of best friends anymore =(. I wanted to go running tonight, but its really yucky looking outside so I doubt I do.

"event","Hi all-- I'm looking forward to meeting you at Conestoga Con-- I'm still trying to figure out how I can be linked directly with FFF so I will see posts as they come in. Is that even possible? Maybe not.<br /><br />Two things I wanted to mention-- better late than never--<br /><br />Mario Acevedo and I are doing a Bloody Valentine Haiku contest on our blog: <a href=""http://www.biting-edge.blogspot.com/"">The Biting Edge.</a> Take a look if you're interested-- <br /><br /><br />Also, this is the last week that I'm the featured author at <a href=""http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/bn/board?board.id=vpttn"">B &amp; N Paranormal/Urban Fantasy website.</a> It's been a blast, as Jeaniene can certainly attest.<br /><br />I guess there were really three things-- I'd love to contribute to the bags for Conestoga Con. Just need the info--<br /><br />Best, Jeanne Stein"

"event","okay, Tez-- You shamed me into this. I know I haven't posted here but I really do have an excuse...Not only am I trying to get a jump start on the fifth Anna Strong book, but this month I'm the guest at Barnes &amp; Noble's online Paranormal/Urban Fantasy Book Club. Marta Acosta is doing an interview and chat with me on her vampwire spot next week and besides all that, I'm doing a couple of proposals for new projects. So, I'm not really ignoring the livejournal, I just don't have the time right now to pay it the attention it deserves. 

Will you forgive me??? Please???

Happy New Year!&nbsp; Your slacker pal-- Jeanne"

"event","Hey Friends-- My name is Jeanne Stein and I'm a new member of FFF. I write the Anna Strong Vampire Chronicles for Ace. The first two, The Becoming and Blood Drive, are on the shelves now. The third, The Watcher, will be released the end of this month. I also have a story in an anthology called Many Bloody Returns edited by Charlaine Harris and Toni Kelner. I'm a fan of Joss Whedon and all things in the Buffyverse. I share a blog with fellow vampire author Mario Acevedo called The Biting Edge. Since I'm new to FFF, I plan to lurk awhile and see what I can contribute. I'm happy to be included in such distinguished company.

Jeanne"

"event","Having just temporarily extracted myself from the mire that is the current Harry Potter fandom, I feel the need to vent. What the ever-loving-hell is wrong with people? I consider myself to be a fairly big fan of the books; big enough that I stood in line at midnight the night that Half-Blood Prince was released. However, my compulsiveness regarding the book barely compares to some of the crap that I've seen in the past few days. Shippers (if you don't know what they are, they are essentially ""relationshippers"", or people who are pulling for certain pairs to become canon), some of whom have apparently invested unhealthy amounts of their own personal energy in the lives of fictional characters, imploding because their pair of choice was nixed by the evil J.K. Rowling. Whiny fans who expected her to champion this or that particular social cause bitching because she did not. Huge arguments over whether the book was a masterpiece or a piece of badly-written fanfiction. Bleh...

I was going to post some type of review of the book, mostly because it's in the forefront of my mind at the moment, but it looks like I'll be wading through this endlessly fascinating crap for the next few days. Yes that makes me a sad little person, but I have this strange fascination with some of the more ""militant"" fringes of most groups (and Harry Potter has got a seriously demented fringe). If any of the two people who have actually friended me (I'm so popular!) are interested, I can certainly provide links so that you can join in on the fun. Not that all of you jerks have actually READ the latest Harry Potter... grumble, grumble."

"event","In my last entry I discussed periods in my hideous writings, many of them revolving around specific actors. Some of these actors (and sometimes singers) had a particular region of the world in common, particularly the British Isles and Ireland (come to think of it, we're definitely going to have to mash Australia in there as well). Now, I'm an admitted Anglophile (I know it's not proper to lump poor Ireland into this heading, but I tend to do so as they are so very geographically close), and have been one for several decades now (wow, that hurt to type!). As such, I have a definite penchant for finding those scrumptious actors from those particular regions particularly appealing. I've daydreamed of and written horrible fanfiction about Ralph Fiennes, Kenneth Brannagh, Daniel Day Lewis (as we saw in the last entry) and Julian Sands, as well as some others that I likely won't think of until I trip across the offending fiction. Jude Law is a recent adddition to the interest list, but thankfully for him he has escaped my horrible fanfiction period (shame on you Jude... you should have been famous a decade ago so I could have blasphemed you as well!).

Today we will be defiling my beloved Julian Sands, wondiferous actor that he was and presumably still is (it's been a while Julian... where are you?). I know for a fact that <i>A Room With a View</i> was my ""inspiration"" for this particular story; dammit, I still love that movie! What a completely smooshy, mushy, incredibly romantic little vignette. I'm feeling all starry-eyed just thinking about it.  My bastardized version of the movie involves an independent, spirited young british chickie named Fayne Devonshire (curse my affinity for torrid romances!). Fayne is a middle child in a low tier, distant cousins of the royals type family. Her father, who is dying at the time of the story, dotes on her as she is the only vaguely intelligent female progeny that he has managed to produce (her two olders sisters are married off to pseudo-royalty, her younger sister is betrothed and her only brother is spoiled rotten). There's no real reason that Fayne has escaped an early marriage, other than the fact that I liked her and wanted better for her (better coming in the form of a hot piece of Englishman). Fayne, reflecting my younger and more liberal views, was an enlightened feminist type, going off to university to better herself and making her disdain of titles and pomp known to everyone. 

Being the cool and modernish British lass that she was, my heroine had herself a <b>male</b> best friend; I'll give you two guesses as to who he really was, though I thinly veiled his identity as Adrian (still ends with an ""ian"" though, eh?). Adrian was, to put it bluntly, the kewliez. The two had met at a co-educational boarding school... say what the fuck? Oh well, willing suspension of disbelief and all that.  Fayne's parents were all excited when they first met him because they considered him to be a possible suitor for their weirdo daughter. After a few years of them just hanging around and being buddy-buddy, they finally gave up on that notion.  Of course, being a master of foreshadowing I couldn't help but add in a few totally unecessary ""explanatory scenes"". In a moment of utter stupidity, Fayne and Adrian have the following conversation about their ""friendship"".

<font color=""#008000""><b>When they'd both caught their breath, Adrian had looked her straight in the eye and told her something that she vividly remembered. ""Actually, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea for us to be married. You're by far the most decent female I know."" Fayne was highly impressed, as this was one of the most gracious compliments he'd ever paid her. He had a definite intolerance of most women, considering them too empty-headed and flighty to merit any worth. To call her the most decent female he knew was a definite credit to both her intellect and character.

""As far as I'm concerned you are the only male I could ever tolerate spending the rest of my life with, excluding James of course."" Fayne didn't hate men, and she especially loved her father, who was kind and patient, yet she would brook none of their nonsense</b></font> Huh? Oh, and James is her younger brother by the by... not that it makes her statement any less creepy and vaguely incestual.<font color=""#008000""><b> Any man who would treat her as a lesser would never command her respect, and that left her with very few choices. Adrian was one of only a few of his breed.

""Well, "" Adrian said, flipping an errant blonde lock off of his face,  ""if either of us should ever find ourselves in need of a mate, for whatever reason, we shan't hesitate to contact the other."" Once again laughing, they'd shaken hands on it, Fayne calling it a gentleman's agreement</b></font> Hahahahahaha, it's funny because she's a GIRL, get it?

The main thrust of the story revolves around the dying father and a deal that he strikes with his daughter, which is ever so conveniently directly related to the above annoying conversation. Daddy dearest informed his daughter of the SUPAR SEKRAT clause in his will, the one that grants control of the estate to Fayne's husband until such time as her brother has reached the legal age. So, Fayne decides to call in the favor and arrange her own little marriage of convenience. Of course, she's still pretending that this is a ""sham"" marriage between friends... as if anyone (including me) really believed that they'd be able to keep their paws off the handsome young Julian Sands type for any period of time. Please.

Still deluding herself, she writes Adrian an urgent letter, calling in her favor simultaneously. He rushes to England in a veritable flash, arriving just before the untimely death of Lord Devonshire (he's the bestest!). They head off to her father's study to discuss their arrangement, and Adrian marvels at how pretty she's become (again, some subtle foreshadowing going on here folks). Then they have a stilted discussion about the ""arrangement"".

<font color=""#008000""><b>""So, am I to assume that your answer to my proposal is yes?""

""Well, I had hoped for something more formal, perhaps a declaration of undying love underneath a canopy of stars."" Adrian was delighted to hear her laughter at this. ""Yes Fayne, I do accept. As I told you once before, you're the only female I deem worthy.""

""I thought perhaps that you'd found someone in Paris that would change your mind.""

""The only difference between English and French women is the accent darling. They all happen to be mindless."" </b></font> Score 1 for misogyny!

<font color=""#008000""><b>""My Adrian, the misogynist."" Briefly she carressed his cheek, a gesture of extreme fondness. ""Perhaps we should discuss the particulars? Although this is what is technically termed as a 'marriage of convenience', you will still receive every benefit I have to offer.""</b></font> Man, that is some seriously sexy talk right there! <font color=""#008000""><b>A home at either this or the London estate, access to the fortune and any title incurred. When my brother comes of age, I fully expect that he will turn the inheritance over to us as he has no interest in such obligations. Of course, we shall also have each others company whenever desired, and perhaps... "" she hesitated as if unsure. ""... if both of us should wish... the option to someday have children. </b></font> Psst... she means that they are going to have some steamy sex scenes in the future.

From here on out, she tries to justify things by saying that her oldest sister's bastard of a husband will be none too pleased with the arrangement and will call the marriage a sham if possible. So, in order to get around that, her ""cherry"" must be officially popped. Adrian agrees and they both wax rhapsodic about what a great marriage they'll have. Look, I can't blame her for wanting to make the marriage less of a convenience and more of a sexfest... hell if I weren't married myself and in her shoes I'd be all over it. However, I somehow think that if this ""marriage of convenience"" had been to someone other than the pseudo Julian Sands that she would have been finding any way that she could around the sexorring.

I didn't get very far with the story, and I'm really not sure where I was going with it beyond that. You see, it would have been pretty boring if the rest of it was just about them having spectacular sex and astounding intellectual conversations. Likely as not I was probably going to throw another female into the mix to get the jealousy thing going, or have the oldest sister's husband cook something up to temporarily push them apart. How else would they get back together and have incredible make-up sex to end the story happily? 

Next time around I'll try to dig up one of my Ralph Fiennes stories. I know I have one with both he and Matthew McCounaughey (what a likely pair!) that was written less than a decade ago (embarrassingly enough for me)."

"event","Well, I've unfortunately dug up even more craptastic fanfiction to post here, but I suppose I need to give a bit more background on it (yet again). You see, in my many illustrious years as an unknown, crappy fanfiction writer, I went through many ""periods and eras"". These periods were often defined by certain books, movies or songs, though most often movies. To take this a bit further, many eras also revolved around certain actors and/or singers. The story for today's posting took place during my Daniel Day-Lewis Era, Last of the Mohicans period; this would put me at around 21 years of age when writing the story. Yes, may >insert diety here< have mercy on me, but I was still writing fanfiction in my 20's. 

The background of the story is non-existent (which translates to ""I probably had an idea at the time that I was writing it, but I only managed to write four pages of it down and I've forgotten it now""), but it seems to revolve around Hawkeye (or Nathaniel of you prefer) and some random self-insert of me named Jamie. During this time in my life I was heavily into bodice rippers, trashy romance novels with no redeeming value other than coming up with a thousand amusing ways of referring to penises and vaginas. Being that I was romantically inexperienced at the time (read ""a virgin""), this was pretty much all I had to go off of whilst attempting to write the HAWT SEXOR'S scenes.

Apparently relying on the book/movie verse a bit, Nathaniel is the white son adopted by Indians (maybe Mohicans, but who the fuck knows if I was writing it); either way, he's one of the last of what ever the hell tribe I assigned him to at the time. Jaime, my self-insert, is some vapid white chick with a teeny drop of Navaho somewhere in her bloodline. Naturally, Nathaniel wants to marry Jaime because she possesses this ever so precious diluted bit of Indian blood... he thinks it's some kind of sign that they are ""meant to be"". In actuality, this is just an excuse for Jaime and Nathaniel to get down and dirty in his wigwam (or whatever).

Now, Daniel Day Lewis is an attractive man, in my humble opinion, and he was particularly appealing in that movie because he played the HERO. However, I would certainly hope that either he or his character could come up with better dialogue than this crap:

<font color=""#0000ff"">In a motion that surely took less than a split second, Nathaniel reached out with one arm and pulled her against his bare chest, forcing her to look up into his green eyes.<i><b>At least I didn't call them orbs.</b></i> ""Look at me Jaime!"" he commanded, struggling to grab her face with one hand and hold her tight with the other. <b><i>Didn't we just establish all of this?</i></b>""Look into my eyes!"" He finally captured her gaze and held it. ""Now, tell me there's no spark between us, no 'chemistry'. Your mouth may lie, but your body cannot. I feel how it responds even now.""</font>

Dear >insert another random diety<, the man has GOT to be more articulate than that. But the cheese doesn't stop there folks... not when I'm in charge!

<font color=""#0000ff"">Jaime felt the color rising in her cheeks, felt the warm flush spread over her body, yet she could not tear her gaze from his. <b><i>Sounds about as erotic as the mumps!</i></b>""I feel you tremble against me, I feel the heat of your body burn against mine, and yet you try to deny it."" HIs voice against her ear was little more than a hoarse whisper. ""You are mine Jaime, and I am yours... we were born for each other."" <b><i>Oh, puke.</i></b></font>

What follows after this is a lot of mindless blathering from both of them; she actively tries to foist him off on any other woman (as if I would have REALLY done that in any circumstance) and he keeps  jibbering about ""fate"" and ""destiny"". The really astounding part is when he tells her that he's not Navaho (yep, I watched the movie and STILL got the ancestry wrong). The dumbass broad has the gall to actually be surprised at this revelation.

<font color=""#0000ff"">HIs answer was the ultimate surprise in the many that she'd received that day.<b><i>Yeah, and I'm sure that the sun rising in the morning and setting in the evening would be a ""surprise"" to a genius like this girl.</i></b>""I'm not at all Navaho in blood Jaime, not a drop."" Smiling at her expression, he let her go. ""Surely you guessed""<b><i>Apparently he has severely overestimated her mental capacities.</i></b></font>

<font color=""#0000ff"">""I... I knew you had some white in you... your features and your eyes said that. I just thought your father had been married twice, or had a white mistress."" Jaime stammered, unable to deal very quickly with his rather casual statement of fact. <b><i>Fuck it all... I give up on this bimbo!</i></b></font>

The remaining two pages are an incoherent justification of them having animalistic sex right there; as if that needed to be justified! The sex scene is only barely started, as I was having difficulty at the time writing about a subject about which I had little to no working knowledge. It's just as well, because I'm sure it would be awkwardly worded and impossibly un-sexy. That's it. I'm done for today, this is way too much to handle at 4am. I'm off to bed, to dream of hot, stupidly written, pseudo-American Indian sex."

"event","I never update this damned journal and I'm going to try to get on some sort of schedule with that at some point in time. Not like I expect everyone to be waiting around with baited breath for updates (by everyone I mean all two of you), but I paid for this service, so I might as well use it. 

To get to the point, pretentiousness has been a recurring theme in many ways in the past week for me. It started with some idiot on my Don't Amend.com mailing list sending her ""unsubscribe"" notice to the mailing list. This spawned a days worth of idiotic replies to said mailing list by people bitching about the amount of e-mail that this was generating. Way to go geniuses! Let's perpetuate the very thing that annoys us most! Don't Amend.com ended up calling the event a ""hacking"" incident, but I think that they are overreacting a bit. Along with the stupid commentary e-mails, were a bunch of tinfoil conspiracy types, ranting and raving about the ""vast right wing conspiracy"" that had targetted the mailing list. *Sigh*. Don't get me wrong, I think that these people are fighting the good fight on the ""Defense of Marriage Amendment"" issue, but dear fucking Zeus on a goddamn pink elephant, does everything HAVE to be some personal attack by the other side? Does everyone really consider themselves and their cause important enough to warrant attention from the power wielders on the other side of the issue? Granted, you'll get this level of paranoia on the extremely conservative side and it makes me equally as queasy. Get over yourselves people; sometimes things happen because people are flaming idiots!

The past two weekends I've also attended D.C./Baltimore team semi's and finals matches... what can I say about the level of self importance at these things? Crickey, many poets are simply known for their undying love for themselves and their ideas, so it's only natural that I'd spend part of the evening awash in someone else's smelly pretentious ooze. I won't name names, but there was one particularly egregious offender on each evening that made me want to pick the low sodium soy sauce up off of the table in front of me and pour it directly into my ears, hopefully muffling the sound of  his rhetoric. I understand that being an artist of any sort can be a heady thing; people look up to you and admire you for creating something, especially when it jibes with their personal beliefs. It's easy to get a swelled head, and even easier to think that you are somehow profound and enlightened as a result. But, and please trust me on this, you are no different than the rest of us poor schlubs with little or no writing talent... we're just a little bit more bearable because we don't vent our personal grievances to the world in front of an audience. 

Topping off the pretentious meter is this particular website that I stumbled across on the somethingawful.com forums (may they all rot in hell for drawing this to my attention) <a href=""http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=americanalien"" target=""_blank"">Dear God, Please Strike Me Blind Now Okay?</a>. To forewarn those with more delicate dispositions than I, this is the Xanga (an online journal community, mostly populated by adolescents) site for the man who ""Did it all for the nookie... "". I fully expect the next edition of Webster's to include this freaking site in the very DEFINITION of pretentious. I did some leg work, and this man is my age... trust me, you would never guess this from reading his journal entries, which read astounding like those of a 14 year old girl. Damn, it's like he went back in a time machine and stole some of my crappy, post-pubescent ramblings! It's sad, pathetic, mind boggling and fantastically amusing all at once.  The best part is the commentary, most of which comes from the under 18 crowd, who quite understandably identify with this guy and his music. They have an excuse; he, on the other hand has none. At 33, you should not be lingering in a post-adolescent fantasy land, living off of feedback from people who are no longer rightfully your peers. We all have to grow up some time and stop with the self-centered, ""I'm much deeper than you, you don't understand me, you can never feel my pain"" crap that defined us as teenagers. This is a sad testament to what fame can do to you if left unchecked by reality.

Well, back to our regularly scheduled updates after this, whatever they might be... I'll try to wade through some more of my fanfiction as I have to do something with the crap (other than throwing it out of course.. it's far too amusing for that)."

"event","I'm still pouring through my ""collection"" of writings and I'm having way too much fun doing it. I'm definitely going to be posting examples of my finest works up here for everyone (read ""the two people who glance at my journal every so often"") to peruse and make much deserved fun of. The challenge lies in reading through and picking out the best parts. Obviously, the contrived and inexperienced sex scenes must be included in this list as they are always a source of much amusement. 

First, we should probably go through some sort of rough chronology of the horror that is my fanfiction. I started when I was approximately thirteen, writing an epic piece about my Mary Sue and George Michael and their travels through the land of ""twu wuv"" (I would give my right spleen to find that particular story, but I haven't been able to track it down as of yet). I branched out a bit after that into Duran Duran, Menudo (yes, Menudo) and finally into the Brat Pack (Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy were particular favorites). Over the next decade or so (you read right.... I wrote this detritus for a DECADE) I slalomed back and forth between actors and singers, though towards the end I was sticking primarily with the actors. I probably have stories involving every mildly attractive, reasonably famous male from 1984 to 1994. 

I have one loverly story bastardizing Johnny Depp's character from <u>21 Jump Street</u>, Tom Hanson. In it, Tom goes under cover, pretending to be married to a girl named, varyingly, Sierra and/or Devin. The girl's father is a cocaine dealer who happens to live in the Bahamas. Of course, my sueoine falls madly in love with Officer Hanson rather quickly (not that I can blame her... it is Johnny freaking Depp after all). Late at night, in a fit of drowsy angst, Sierra/Devin wanders out onto her balcony to look at the ocean and think. I described the scene as thus ""<i>Her eyes were drawn to the endless stretch of water before her, etched with silvery moonlight. Her body slowly rested on the rail, and her restless mind was lulled by the rhythmic pound of the waves against the shore.</i>"" All of those words when all the bitch was doing was stepping outside to get some air! 

Of course, the wondrous Officer Hanson (let's call him Tom for brevity's sake) follows her outside to calm her troubled mind. In a feeble attempt to sex him up, Devin/Sierra trips down the stair coming back into her room. Get a load of this awkwardly worded section ""<i>As engrossed as she was in her thoughts, Sierra forgot to step down the step that divided her patio from her room. Instead, she stumbled down it, coming only a foot away from crashing to the floor. Tom's quick reflexes were the only thing that saved her, as he caught her a second from the ground and pulled her back into his embrace.</i>"" Holy cheesy plot devices, Batman!  Seriously, ignoring the fact that he would have to be <b>SUPER</b> strong to catch her only a foot from the ground, how the hell could his reflexes be that friggin fast? Johnny Depp is a minor deity, but seriously!

That's all for tonight. Don't fret, the torture will continue soon. I have reams upon reams of this crap ;)."

"event","As I stated in an update a million years ago (in the Cretaceous period), I purchased my lj account solely to view crappy fanfiction in <lj user=""marysues""> and <lj user=""deleterius"">. However, having been a former writer of said crappy fanfiction, I felt it necessary to dig some of the old ""writing"" up from the depths of my parents basement. I have been pouring over the stuff, even typing some of it up, for the past few hours. All I can say is.... what the fuck? I wrote the most hideous and bizarre ""romance"" fiction that I've ever read (and considering where I hang out on a daily basis, that's saying something). 

Now, like many pre-teen and teenage females, I had a metric fuckton's worth of crushes on the popular actors/singers of the time. I tended to take the characters played by the various actors and write fiction about them, which is not unusual in and of itself. Apparently I had some kind of <i><b>searingly</b></i> hot crush on Val Kilmer at one point in time, because I have some particularly offensive stuff written about him. I based one story on his character Chris in <u>Real Genius</u> ; understandable actually as he's completely adorable in that movie. I think I took a step too far when I started a fic based on his character Madmartigan in <u>Willow</u>... you know, the movie where he plays a character who hasn't bathed in what appears to be the past century. I didn't let this little matter of filth get in my way when waxing poetic about his eyes however.... I described them as ""icy blue as the glaciers that flowed across the plains of Greenland"". Excuse me while I vomit copiously now.

I'm still in the process of wading through these suckers and typing them for ""posterity"" (read, to laugh uproariously about for years to come), so maybe I'll have some more stunning prose to share in the next few hours. Please continue waiting with bated breath."

"event","So, I joined the livejournal thing about a month ago, but I didn't really start writing anything until now. I figured, hell, if everyone else writes about their mundane day to day shit, I can too! Mary Sue's were what lured me here in the first place. For those of you that are unfamiliar with the term ""Mary Sue"" (and who stumbled here accidentally), I'll explain. In order to understand Mary Sues, you have to be familiar with a thing called fanfiction (or fan fiction). Fan fiction has been around for years, but with the birth of the internet it has multiplied and spread like some horrible, mutating virus. Basically, fan fiction involves a fan of some movie/tv show/actor/book/etc. sitting down and writing a nice little story at least somewhat based on the characters and storyline that they love. This is the best case scenario. In reality, most often the fan horribly warps both the characters and world to insert some thinly veiled version of themselves into the story.  This thinly veiled version is the Mary Sue; most often perfect in every way, causing everyone around her/him (Marty Stu) to behave in a massively out of character manner. The reader on the other hand wavers from awestruck (at the nerve of the author) to annoyed; it's great fun however.

Mary Sues are probably strangely appealing to me because I wrote about a million of them in my younger years. I have several epic pieces involving myself and George Michael of Wham (hey, this is way before even he knew he was gay!) and various members of Duran Duran. The main character's, all female and based roughly on my appearance at the time, were always fending off evil rapists and falling into the arms of their saviors (George Michael and various members of Duran Duran). It was crappy, horrible, angsty fun. I didn't have a clue what relationships were like... hell, I was 14 and 15 at the time.  Had the internet been existent way back when I most likely would have posted my ""writings"" up for all to see... and gotten the crappy, horrible reviews that they so richly deserved. I am eternally grateful that I grew up in the technological dark ages.

Back to the reason that I joined; I'd recently become interested in Mary Sue's and was spending a good deal of time finding them on fanfiction.net (a veritable goldmine of horrendous writing of all kinds). I think that I googled the term and came up with a gazillion different hits, one of them leading me to the <lj user=""marysues""> community here. I quickly thereafter found <lj user=""deleterius"">, a lovely group devoted to Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter sues (those two books/movies get more sues than any other books and movies combined). The communities are full of wondrous, curmudgeonly ""reviewers"" who cringe at the violation of the characters and canon of their beloved books/movies/tv shows, yet at the same time have an excellent time dredging up these offenses to literacy. Great fun, all in all. 

As a matter of fact, I now feel inspired to locate my prior offenses and type them up (they were all painstakingly handwritten). I doubt I'll foist them on the unsuspecting public, but it will at least give my friend's a good laugh."

"event","I've talked my loverly brother in to joining lj, so now I'll have company at least (hehehe, and one whole person to respond to my posts, whoo hoo!). We are currently working on a website project with a friend of mine, contingent on me learning HTML. The client that I use for lj, Semagic, has been surprisingly helpful with this thus far. Not that it has prepared me for constructing even the simplest website, but it has given me some background in the structure of HTML at the very least.

The ostensible point of the website is to review movies, however it's also a great excuse to see every damned movie in the world and hopefully eventually be able to deduct it from our taxes. As an added bonus, it's going to be damned fun to both write the reviews and critique each other's reviews. My brother is the Grand High Movie Bitch, a snob from way back (or at least part of the way back). I, on the other hand, have to watch a really rancid piece of trash to truly hate it. Dutko, the third to our little movie reviewing triumvirate, is somewhere in between.  Hell, if the Cranky Critic can make money reviewing movies I think that we have at least a small shot. 

In deference to my subject, I'm hoping that between this horrendously boring livejournal and my soon-to-be website I can make it into the ""Awful Link of the Day"" over at <a href=""http://www.somethingawful.com"" target=""_blank"">Something Awful</a>. Hell, I might even submit myself if no one else ever does. We all have to have our dreams.... and speaking of those, it's ass o'clock and time I went to bed."

"event","To spout on about something random, I just returned home from attending the National Poetry Slam 2003 in Chicago. My brother, a multi-talented writer/poet type, was on the DC/Baltimore team. They came in 27th out of 63 teams, which is pretty damned impressive. Poetry slams can be a bit brutal. Scoring is done by randomly selected audience members and they can be a bit fickle and rather unfair in their judgments.

Now, I'm kind of over-protective of my little brother to begin with, but I get even more out of hand when it comes to his poetry. I normally want to throttle the judges that give him low scores (hell, I know he's talented, so why can't the bloody judges figure it out). During the first night of the preliminary competitions there were two judges (they were ""co-judging"" ) in the audience who were scoring consistently lower than everyone else for my brother's team.  They ended up coming in third out of three by a very narrow margin. The second night of preliminaries they kicked major buttocks and came in first, but that first evening of competition took them completely out of the running for the later competitions.

I had an excellent time despite this. My brother and his team received some much deserved attention; in addition they got to mix and mingle with a bunch of other wonderful, flaky poets. It was Chris's (my brother's) first year at the competition and I think he came away with some strong ideas about what he'd like to change next year. I'm not a literary wit of any sort, but I really enjoyed meeting all of the poets that I was fortunate enough to be introduced to. 

Poetry is frustrating... it can be breathtakingly good one minute and ear explodingly bad the next. I don't have much love for political poetry in general. Nearly everyone who writes it is an across the board, unrepentant liberal, and I find that as offensive as any of the right wing tripe that I'm exposed to on a daily basis. If just once, someone would get up and do a piece that was even slightly conservative, or better yet both pro-gun and pro-gay marriage (I'd actually like to see someone work those two ideas into a piece) I'd give them my firstborn child. Hearing the same opinions over and over again is beyond tedious.

I give the utmost kudos to the poets who do the more liberal leaning pieces, but in such a way as to make them fresh and sometimes even compelling. The team from Austin, TX did a great piece on the death penalty, which I loved despite my pro-stance. They had three of my favorite poets (aside from the DC/Baltimore team of course), two of whom performed incredibly funny pieces. I love poets who dish out the humor; there is a dearth of them in the slam community. I'd like to be one of ""TEH FUNY!!1!"" poets one day, but I have a sneaking suspicion that I lack the talent for it."

Elder kamosi really reminds of cooper king and that makes me think of the good ol' days and hockey day. hockey day i miss the most.  i miss sports in general which is weird because i never considered myself a very competitive/aggressive type of guy. who knows.  my roommate got his mission call to the ukraine. the ukraine is pretty much straight north from greece. if i yell, he will hear me.  i wonder if he will see elder hubert.  there are 2 missions in the ukraine though.  he will be speaking ukranian.  i never thought about it but another roommate went to mexico where elder krieger is. so 2 roommates in the same country as 2 friends. fate....."

"event","Middle aged females, by far, have the worst apparel.  I don't know what happens but, sometime around the middle of their lives, they start wearing outfits that are more craft project than clothes.  Take, for example, the woman in my bio lecture, today she was wearing an entire pumpkin patch.  I didn't see, but i would be willing to bet my left arm that she had a festively sickening pair of earrings to match her get up.

Wearing craft projects is bad, but what is even worse is those moms who are coming back to college and they try to fit in.  I commend their dedication to furthering their education, but the line needs to be drawn somewhere.  They might as well live in the on-campus dorms.  I wonder if BYU would even let someone do that.  I will try it if i ever come back to college when im old.  It would be pretty sweet to have a roommate that was in his mid 40s.  He could easily get us the hook-up for all the keggers we throw here.  And he would probably know how to take care of himself, unlike say, some of my roommates.

today was beautiful, everything always seems extra green and the sky extra blue after its been cloudy for a few days.  it is incredibly humid though, my car is dry when i go in for seminary and so fogged up when i came out i had to make my little brother squeegy it down so i could see.
i hate this high school, they think they are so good because they are the number one ranked high school in georgia. what they dont realize is that they are the number one ranked school in GEORGIA. also they never dream someone would decide to go out of state for college.

"event","captain's log: day 1
   
   the camera we got for christmas is way cooler than i previously thought.  i should have read the users manual in the first place.

  every once and awhile i come into contact with someone that is different than everybody else i've met. i like it a lot.  for one reason or another i really get along with them, or so i feel. it's like interacting with them takes no effort at all.  which is big for me because most of the people i interact with takes a huge effort just to talk with them. i look in their eyes and it feels different than other people... a deeper understanding, if you will.

i have to go to lowes to buy light bulbs. i normally wouldn't mind, but i have to drive the van. i hate driving the van, the way it handles just plain sucks."

"event","alright alright. so after a second viewing of the third harry potter, ive decided i cant wait for the fourth one to come out. not because i want to see the book turned to film, but because hermione is just so dang cute. seriously i want to find one of those life-size cardboard cutout things of her to put in my room.

   i talked to my brother his roommates are 23, 24, 25, 26. so i think getting ""the gang"" back together is quite possible, if we have the determination and/or desire to do so.

   i havent got a chance to go and see spiderman 2 yet, sorry jeff, but no hotties would go with me.  my own family wont even go with me.

   i like to put lots of pepper on my food, it just looks so good. i dont even like pepper all that much."

"event","talk about your delayed reactions, but i had the best time of my life in san antonio.  it wasnt anything like i expected, mainly because i keep my expectations very low, it makes life easier.  to me there didnt seem to be a difference between this summer and when i lived there.  either no one has changed or everyone has changed the same amount.  i probably liked it more than was healthy for me.  the odds of me seeing anyone again are probably very small, what with college and missions. although lucas and i did briefly discuss plans for post-mission life. i dont know if he was serious, i was."

NO WAY! and it was grand and then the fireworks show was like an hour long and it was really cool and then we went and ate dinner and stuff and yea then we came home on tuesday...and now its wednesday! and i wathed the movie my sister was in last night and i almost fell over when her part was a make out scene at a party. i was like OHHH dear. and then my sister is getting married in something like 16 days and so my cousin is coming down and im super excited to get to spend some time with her!! haha well yea...im out thanks for reading <3 xoxo"

"event","okay so i havent written in here for awhile so this be a long entry...i went to dallas from sunday until thursday and wow...it was a lot of fun but it was kinda sad you know? i went and saw jess before she moved to michigan and wow michigan is really far away! its not just the four hour drive anymore, more like 24 and we've been friends since we were 4 and its just ill miss her a whole lot! but of course i'll talk to her alll the time and ill see her occasionaly so its no big deal right? while we were up there we went to the kohls, olive garden, the mall, the denton square thing, umm...wendys and this pool party thing for kats church and omg it was a blast, and i met some absolutely amazing people. kat and tiffany were super sweet and lucas was just...wow. makes houston boys seem like really really big JERKS. i really miss seeing him and the thing is...i prolly will never see him or kat or tiffany again. so i guess that you just have to take the time that you have with people and remember them and idk...treasure the time you have with them right? its just sad that you have to let them go knowing that you prolly will never get to see them again. small towns are alot different then houston is, but in alot of good ways, and a few not so good ways. and then i came home on thursday and friday cherise and i went to the mall and sonic cus she got her license! and at sonic we didnt realize that the route 44 was really 44 ounces...and omg it was REALLY BIG! they wouldnt even fit in the cup holders! it took us FOREVER to drink them. but it was a reallllly good cherry limeade. :) and then saturday i went to katy mills mall and that mall kinda sucks! it had some fun stores though and then we came home and my mom made enchiladas and Oh it was so good. then my sister and i went to kohls and wal mart and came home... then today i woke up and went to church and i had these really fun new heels to wear. and cherise and i went to b service sunday school and it was much better than a...so im going to try that one for awhile and if that doesnt work then well im gonna try highway 249. OH YEAH! and i missed the canvas waiting show last night because i love how nobody told me about it...even though i absolutely LOVE them. thanks guys...thanks alot. i feel REALLY loved....getting left at home while you went to canvas waiting...thanks a bunch. anyways...call me next week and we can go to something! i miss so many people...and i really want to see ya'll *cough* katie! shelina! and some other people :o) call me! and i really miss ya'll dallas guys...if you're reading this. jess lucas kat...yea you know who im talkin about! well i told you this was going to be really long but hey whatever...thanks for reading! and oh yea...i saw collin this morning and i miss seeing him like all the time! babe we need to get together! okay...im done now i promise...i love you guys!"

Ludo was so good! it was me, victoria, andie, fondren, christina and some ryan guy and a bunch of other people. it was lots of fun. and then i came home and umm thats about it! im sitting here at midnight typing this thing...great. well ill talk to you guys later. rock out. (Sorry...i just felt like saying that)"

"event","okay so theater banquet was last night and it was pretty good i guess...i mean i love my friends and we had a great time together but it made me realize a lot of stuff and how gay people can be. how people can step all over everyone else b/c they have morals. what a great world huh? well my date and i came back to the house and just talked it out and there were a certain two things that were established. and i just wish that things could be different sometimes. but they are what they are and we have to make the best of it i guess...so yea i totally kind of forgot/got really busy so i havent written in here...sorry! i <3 you still and im going to try real hard...and of course this summer when i have nothing else to do...ill remember. i really want to hang out with certain people this summer...and i hope i get to do that. i really want to meet new people too...idk expand the horizons a little bit..haha that sounds so gay. so last night here is the officers: (Yay)
president-kyle
vice president-jordan

and then (Sorry guys) i dont remember the other titles but it was:
shelina, brittany, danielle, daniel, rob. 

so congrats you guys. 

then there was senior wills (which were really long) and gag awards...and shelina got like three real awards. which is way cool. lol and then we watched the slideshow/movie which was pretty good and they did the song and umm in the pics and the song they totally left out ocg...i love bieng forgotten. we worked our asses off on that play and because nobody super ""important"" was in it...then it was considered shit. thanks guys...thanks alot. and i probably shouldnt be posting this but wth. its my journal. if you dont want to read it then dont. i hate being walked on. i hate feeling used.

"event","so it's yet another day...umm...i read shelina's live journal and it made me think...hey i should start one again. though i can NEVER keep up with them. but im going to try really hard this time? so anyways...my weekend was interesting. friday i was sick. so i didnt go to school and i missed a lot of stuff that i'm NOT excited about making up. saturday i went and took my drive test and passed it. thank God. so now...july 19th...i actually get to drive my car. freedom. i can't wait. alot has been going on lately that i cant exactly explain, some people know the majority of it, but you know...there's just some stuff that you cant let out in the open. i donno so i started writing alot again, which is helpful because it clears my mind and idk helps me think and relax a little. i cant wait for summer. i finally get to leave freakin high school for three months. its impossible to think that so much stress, heartache, headaches, and anger can come from one building. along with a hell of a lot of confusion. yesterday, cherise came over and we watched happy gilmore. and then today i went to church and then cherise came out to eat with me at olive garden. omg it was so good. and then we learned what a lutheran REALLY is. (its an inside joke dont get offended) and then i came home and slept until...5 and then made this thing...and well im out.

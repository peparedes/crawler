"event","My Michael-imposed New Year's resolution is to write more. So here it goes. Sometimes I feel smarter than everyone. Sometimes it's hard even to communicate with other people because I can actually sense the distance of the levels between us. This isn't conceited. Because other times I do feel completely stupid. Ignorant, at least. But the smart times, it's not always even a good feeling. It's lonely and it just makes me feel bad, I'm sick of humoring people. People at work are smart,though. It's surprising. 

I have this problem where I stare at people. I'm just so interested. Then they catch me and I feel like they think I'm perverted or something. But I'm not, I am just fascinated. 

The New Year has started out painfully for the world and for me. 

Not that I'm sad at the moment. I think I cried it all out. I saw Garden State again. I liked it even better this time. This is boring. I'd say I'm boring now because it would be characteristic of me to say that, as in it follows my usual negative spiral of thought, except I don't believe that. I'm not bored. I feel smart, I feel confident. I have high self esteem and depression. I'm hard on myself but I know it. 

Happier thoughts. It's a new year. I want to have babies. Not this year, but eventually. I have fantasies of feeding children ice cream for breakfast on special days. I want a little boy with glasses. I want a few. I want them spilling out onto my lap. I want to have too many to keep track of even, like the women who lived in the shoe. I'm definitely hormonal. I have no problem admitting that my period makes me crazy, I'm learning to attribute these feelings to my hormones, which is working out. I'm so much of a feminist that I can say that unapologetically. I would rather be a man though, it seems easier."

"event","I have the GRE tomorrow. Or today. Or in like 3 hours. I can't sleep. I now know what chary means, it means wary. They rhyme. That one's easy. How about perfidiousitoritarian, I made that one up. I'm feeling a little wild in the night. I have a yeast infection. I'm starting full-time on Monday, or I'm beginning my rest-of-my-life enslavement to barely sustain myself financially tomorrow. 

This is going to be deep. In a My So Called Life way, which means it will be deep but will also include the words like and whatever to still remain flippant and nonchalant. Okay here it goes:

The thing about depression is, it's like sometimes you just feel kind of low, but other times you have these episodes. The episodes might last a couple of weeks and you might be feeling really imbalanced. Sometimes it's like you are far away, like it's the early morning and everyone's asleep but in the middle of the day it's like that. Sometimes the episode is just this moment. Like you're at work on the computer or watching elimidate or something and you think about killing yourself but in this really pragmatic way, like it would solve a lot of problems and I wouldn't have to worry about sleeping tonight. And then you are outside of that thought for a moment and you look at yourself sitting on the couch or at the computer really wanting to die, and you think wow I'm so depressed for that person. And then someone says something and you take a second and then you smile and they say what were you thinking of and you say nothing. And when you have enough moments like this, it becomes exhausting because you have felt completely alone, completely alone, not the cliched phrase but the actual feeling of being completely alone and then in one second you rebounded from that feeling to appear normal. And here you are on the couch or at the office and you have just decided not to kill yourself and then someone asks you if you want a piece of gum or something and you have to smile and nod or say no, and don't forget the thank you, or whatever. 

Anyways, that's my life. On top of that I've had the I'm depressed talk with my family, which can only lead to no good. Luckily, mental health is covered by my work benefits so I'm starting therapy in January. Wow, I was actually reading my first entries to livejournal and I was noticing how I used to be funny and I thought I'd write a funny post to see if I still had it in me. Somehow it led to talk of suicidal ideation. That is kind of funny actually. 

In other news, there are over 9,000 children in Arizona living in out-of-home care. These children have developmental delays, physical health problems, attachment disorders, and a host of other problems resulting from the abuse, neglect and abandonment that caused CPS to remove them from their homes. Try writing that 50 times a day and staying positive. The world is so sad. Because it takes one second to destroy something, and a lifetime to fix anything. Oh yeah, I was going to be funny.

Michael and I are living together, as you know. I am messy. Michael is neat. But every morning after he takes a shower he leaves his underwear (boxer briefs, aw) behind the door of the bathroom. Then every morning I sniff them and then put them in the hamper. It's great. This morning I wrote him an email saying that I was still reeling from the pleasure of sniffing his undies around lunchtime. Hey, I thought it was funny. Also, do you know what abscond means. Well, I remember it like this: abscond sounds like sconce right? Right. And sconce is like a candelabra. No you remember Lumier from Beauty and the Beast, he was a candelabra, well there's that scene where he runs off to the dungeon to light up the path to the beast for belle, so picture that. Okay so abscond means to steal off clandestinely. And clandestinely sounds like candelabra too. Ah, if only I knew words like abscond in the first place. Most people probably know that."

I got a job (!) grant writing for an adoption agency. Michael bought me presents, and I got an excellent review of my memoir piece. It was the best review I've ever gotten, one man, an ex-professor pulled me aside during break. He was like how old are you? 22. Wow. That made me feel pretty good. He said definitely get an MFA. I finally got officially signed up for my thesis. I'm submitting ""Sex Toys"" for publication in less that a week, and my advisor, Maximilian (cool name, cool guy) says I've got a strong shot. I'm feeling smart, which is a good feeling. I'm feeling stimulated.

"event","Still unemployed. Every other complaint stems from that one. Except for that it's hot. That is my complaint to the all-powerful God of the Universe. Fucker. I'm reading Middlesex, which is a Pulitzer Prize winning novel about a hermaphrodite. Me and Michael discussed how when we were little we thought it was the Pull-it Surprise! You know, where Mr. Pull-it jumps up from behind the couch throwing confetti. Last night I was being funny. I've been exercising, shockingly. Yoga twice a week and I'm starting pilates and on Monday I lifted weights. It's hard to believe. But my ass is firm. Michael took a short video of me requesting that he feel my butt, I didn't know he was taking it, I was turned around. It's funny because now he has this video documenting my conceit. I'm saying, well whining actually, ""Mikey, feel my tushie, isn't it hard?"" He cups it and then screams ""Jesus, Sivan."" Then I shake it around (I'm wearing a leotard don't worry) to show him how it's not jiggling. Then we took some hot naked pictures in the pool, experimenting with light. He photoshopped one and it looks really arty. We were inspired by voyeurweb.com which is a porn site we look at. It's free and it's real people posting pictures of their nasty wives and girlfriends. It's fun because some are just hideous and people are always commenting ambiguous things like ""wow."" But then you'll find a hottie, which is exciting among all the other trollios, plus they're real people so they're not all porned out. I actually kind of want to post naked pictures of myself because there's a contest and you can win dinero, but I can't bring myself to do it. Then some nasty swinger couples will start propositioning me, plus I'm one of those people who rarely forgets that I have a mother."

"event","Once again may I say I hate livejournal. But also it is at least some writing. I'm going on vacation to a cruise with the Sper family on Sunday. God help me. I know my biggest problem is that I have to go on a cruise. My vagina problems have ceased for this week. Also, Michael is sleeping, so I'm bored. In other news, I am trying to win 25,000 through this essay contest, it's a long shot. But it's $25,000. The fan is blowing it's cool on my body but my feet itch and are numb because I put some numbing goop on them. But they still itch. Fuckers. I want to die. In other news, I still want to die. Also, I want to kill myself.

I can't get a job. Nobody will hire me. I don't have skills. I do, but not job skills. Well I can use Peachtree accounting, and I can write an erotic short story, and I can do the splits on my left side, and I do have great tits, and I give a mean blowjob, and I can cry on command, and I can think of highly imaginative, almost genius ways in which to kill myself, but these skills accumulatively don't fit under a specific job title. I mean Senior Project Managers don't do that. I could be a stripper.

Michael and I were bored last night, but that's not news. So we decided to go for an aimless drive. He said let's drive to Van Buren and look for whores. So we did. But we didn't find any whores. Before that we ate baba ganoush at Oasis cafe. And then we couldn't find whores, even though we drove up and down Van Buren and Washington and even the side streets scouting for them. So we went to this adult shop and bought tokens for two dollars and went into the ""arcade"" and watched porno movies. It was pretty embarrassing buying those tokens and the guy behind the counter, sporting a nasty goatee and a long fingernail for coke snorting, said ""Let me know if you get any trouble."" But there was no trouble just one other guy back there listening to loud porno movies and we could find out which one he was watching by getting our sound to match his, when there's no competing sound you know you've got it. Anyway so there are these rules going in on sign, no sex and all that, but also no fashioning holes in the booths. So of course there's a hole in our booth and of course I immediately look through but there's no one next to us, just an empty booth and of course there's a hole in that one too. 

Later at home Mike finds all these bits of gunk in my hair, which really isn't that unusual since I'm dirty but then we attribute it to my head resting against the back of that nasty arcade booth because it's a pleasing thought. We also wanted to steal this cow, a fake lawn cow somewhere off Van Buren but we never did. 

We had this scenario where we get the cow and then we get a prostitute and then the hooker asks where we got the cow and we say we stole it, and she says, ""you guys are sick fucks."" 

There may have been prostitutes though, because later driving down Apache we saw two that looked suspect one was dressed like one and the other had a conservative outfit but a whore face. All withered and strung out. 

That's all for now."

Just because I giggle all day, that doesn't mean I don't want to kill myself. And just because I mope about, that doesn't mean I'm not happy. I'm nothing and everything. I'm not even being poetic. I'm not being pretentious. I don't think I have all the answers. I just try to give advice, and so what if I like to hear myself talk? Don't we all? 

I love Michael who is reading his book, furrowing his eyebrows, drinking it in with the quick scanning of his eyes. Writing is so pretentious. Especially good writing. Weaving themes, and successful metaphor, and wonderful imagery all just make me want to die. As if I have any right to be good? And who knows if I'm good, I'm being nurtured only by Michael (who's obviously biased) and a small collection of people in writing classes who have to say that I'm good. But fuck all that humility, I am good, at least better than the very bad writers in class. I love myself and hate myself more than anyone on the outside will ever even begin to understand, so don't even try to make me feel bad, because I am the best at that. I know all my secrets. I know every shitty thing I've ever done, especially the ones you don't. I'm a cheater and a liar and I'm self-indulgent and obsessed, I'm unhygeinic, disordered, messy, emotionally unstable, elitist, but I do care about people. I love certain people and if they don't know that, if they don't understand my good intentions at least towards them, then I am truly a hopeless case."

"event","Tomorrow is my first CAT scan. I'm sleeping over at Mike's and he's going with me. It was funny because I had to bring a change of clothes and I was thinking ""What does one wear to a CAT scan?"" You don't want to be under or overdressed for an occasion like this. Pelvic exam to check for Kidney stones. I went to the urologist today and we progressed to examining for a possible diagnosis. A diagnosis is very comforting. I'd rather know that I was dying than think maybe I had a cold. The uncertainty is what bothers me. That's ridiculous of course. I'm glad I'm not dying, especially now that my new pills are also anti-depressants, but only at ten times the dosage I've been prescribed. So if I'm ever having a bad day, I can just overdose on gina medicine. 

If the CAT scan is clear then they have to stick some cameras up my urethra and take photographs. Maybe I'll acquire copies and post them here on livejournal, that would be poetic, you know showing you my insides. My soul, or rather the inside of my urethra. Either way I'm close to being officially diagnosed with interstitial cystitis. IC the urologist called it. That's cool. I'm really going to play up this CAT scan for all its worth. I may shave my head tomorrow just for the melodrama. 

P.S. I decided on jeans and a tight striped shirt and practical shoes. I figured high fashion footwear might look strange peeking out of the scan machine. Still, I wanted to look cute."

The silence between them was shrinking, more gaps filled in by their growing love. What little silence was left was washed out by the sound of the drizzling rain, tossed aside was the awkwardness, picked up by the storm and sent out to thrash in the horizontal winds. She was itchy, buzzing with the aid of a happifying pill, unsure of her feelings. ""Unsure""--the one word she would use to describe herself. And his was ""terrified."" Terrified he had said earlier that evening sitting in a too small classroom with her. Small spaces where there wasn't much room to move, she wasn't really claustrophobic, not in the physical sense anyway, but she was emotionally. Afraid of enclosed places. He allowed her to move, to make mistakes, he knew she would, he knew she was flaky and inconsistent, and still he wanted her. He loved her. And the word ""terrified"" sent out, echoing in that interior space, bounced off the walls, picking up velocity as it hit each one so she had to duck to miss its impact.

I ordered a sloth for Joe when he went to the toilet. I said goodbye to Katherine this morning, she went out of town, she bought me a present which was nice, so did Ian, he bought me a book called Posh & Becks about guess who and it even has pictures and a comment on the back about it being profound, which is typically English, taking the piss and all. 
 
I'm reading this book now called ""The Autograph Man"" by Zadie Smith about a Chinese Jewish British man's obsession with fame yo it's pretty good. I bought some more books too, I'm into it ya know, their new shininess, their ability to validate my value as a writer, stuff like that.

I plan guerrilla warfare in the form of a paper cut, and then when said paper cut is bleeding, it's cheese for me. Also, I cannot sleep anymore. Also I got pick-pocketed and they took my camera and I almost died on New Year's Eve, death by the trample. Trampling, that is. My head feels light and I could swoon swoon swoon and I'm in a writing mood which makes me feel like Leah with her slick teeth, slick like the wet pavement, slippery like my mind, which goes swoon swoon swoon til it aches. I bought some books with slick hardback covers, the bookstore smell makes me happy. I'm coming home in a few days to the desert, back to my life, back to the past, back to everything that feels so far away, and I'm happy and scared and I can't sleep without 4 Nytols. No less than 4 will do, which is an overdose. I overdose nightly. I love you all, I miss everything, I hope you all still love me and are anxiously awaiting my return with banners and confetti and love and slick, wet kisses on my chipmunk cheeks. Slick, delicious wet tongues to pierce me with their love. Oh yeah."

Then we went to the museum of sex machines, which was equally exciting. Everything is cheap here and amazing. This city is weird and beautiful and really sort of magically dark.

Michael's not reading anymore. It upsets him. Understandable. 

Maybe nobody is reading, yet I can't stop. I can't stop because I like journaling and strangely I can keep this up much more consistently than a handwritten journal. I spoke with Daniel on the phone, which made me very happy. I spoke with Keren too. I'm going to Prague in a couple of weeks. 

I'm coming home January 10th or 11th I can't remember exactly. That's not too far away. Do I write anything of value? I think not.

This forum always upsets me. Yet I continue. Keep sludging through. I miss everyone. Yesterday I sat in my room and got incredibly homesick. So I wrote on my computer I wrote and wrote and it turned into a short piece about a girl (me let's not kid ourselves) and I find it all so depressing. I was talking to Joe about his girlfriend, asking him what she's like, and he said she's always happy, she always puts everyone in a good mood. And then I thought how I must bring people down, how in order to relate to me people need to be depressed and that in itself was depressing.

We ate fancy french food, although Michael never ate his being sick, he just looked at it, admiring the efforts in presentation. We went to the Notre Dame, to the Eiffel tower at night, to the Orsay, on the metro, which isn't as cool as the tube, and ate Chinese in the Latin Quarter. All this in one day to make up for Saturday, which was spent in the hotel (gorgeous by the way, although rude Parisian bastard service) watching Europe's MTV Video Music Awards. 

Then we came back to London, did the London thing for a while, Mike took me shopping and spoiled me rotten, we stayed up all night and discussed our intellectual pursuits. We often discuss our dreams, it's a part of our relationship that no one sees, it's the most fulfilling thing in the world to support and be supportive of someone else's dreams.

Michael left this morning and I felt sick and sad and relieved that all went well. That it wasn't perfect, but still, I couldn't have imagined it better. The intimacy will be missed. Michael flattered me. He said I was thin and beautiful and a competent city girl, that he forgot how funny I was, plus, you know, good in the sack. I am wasting away. It's 3:12 pm and so far today I've eaten a small packet of crisps. Salt and Vinegar. Yuck.

There was a lot of eating when Michael was here, but I fear I'll slip back into starvation. It was nice to have someone take care of me for a bit, I know that's not very feminist of me, but mostly, I've been taking care of myself. So it's not bad being pampered for a short time. But now it's over. He's gone, gone, gone, gone, it really is sad. I can't believe it. It was so short. 

I have class in 7 minutes. I'm tired and just feeling so weird today, so strange and sticky and sort of sick and sad in my bones. My life has become very strange. Very doubled. I have two lives. They're bleeding into each other and it makes me feel light-headed. Fucking self-reflection. You know I hate it.

Then she said that she doesn't like him. She goes ""I hate his accent."" I thought that was incredibly funny. Then she talked about how sometimes on the tube she imagines going up to random people and saying ""Will you fuck me?"" 

I'm really obsessed with my phone, with texting, I just texted Joe to get my chicken korma out of the freezer. Ian sends me the funniest texts, like once I asked him how to dress for this club, and he said it's kind of like Shelley Winters meets concentration camp victim, I had to laugh.

I'm trying to learn to say cheers naturally so when I get back I can be cool and say cheers upon receiving the pipe. Of course it's the pipe that I will be receiving. 

This boy in my class today cracked me up because he was talking about how depressed he is and how all he does is watch friends and how even the title makes him sad because it is a direct reminder that the show is just an antidote for his loneliness. He really was depressed in a funny way, and I felt bad laughing at him, but still, I told him that I get stressed too, that's why I was laughing. Then he said how he is determined to become an alcoholic or acquire some leafy greens and I thought that was funny. I told him to meditate. And he said he tried that but he just got angry. 

One week until Michael comes, I can't believe it. I feel like I haven't seen him for so long. It feels like I used to live in Arizona ten years ago. And I'll be coming home ten years from now. It feels like my whole life has been spent freaking out about my module handbooks, going to the internet cafe with Katherine, bullshitting with Roxanne until 5 am, or going to late night Flames Kebabs with Joe and Finn and the boys from Rochester. Joe and I went to see Killbill last night, but it was sold out so we got to see Down with Love instead, which was cool because I got friend points for my willingness to see the boy movie, but then got to see the girl movie anyway. Joe is from Philly and is my best friend of the week, and we have devised a plan to bring AIM to starving African children.

Tonight I'm going to a club, it's a party for models, and I can look at all the beautiful people. But also it's where agents go to find models. So I am pretending I'm not interested. But I'm very interested in a stranger coming up to me and saying ""wow, we've been looking for a short girl with mild acne and really hot tits for our new Prada line.""

So basically I have replaced sleep with a permanent state of zombied awakeness, which makes me sick and appetite-less and reflective. 

How do you expect me to sleep? I'm so far away from everything really. At night that fact comes a-creeping into my mind and steals my sleep units away. 

I have friends. I will tell you all about them. Roxanne is British and she is Northern, which she is very conscious about, so she works hard at her London accent and makes sure to always be fashionable. She keeps me up at night because I'm funny so when I try to go to sleep she actually comes into the room, squeals and then pulls me off the bed. She says things like ""you rubbish bastard"" and tries to get me to try the accent but I am utter shit and then she says that I am dead funny. I slept in her bed the other night and then she said ""something bad is going to happen"" and then she farted twice and we laughed and laughed. 

Ed is Italian and he is affectionate and talks about sex all the time and lost his virginity a few nights ago so now he is extra cocky. He has a friend named Khalid who's half English half Saudi and we suspect that despite their clever ruse, they are in fact gay lovers. Ed is clearly the bitch.

Penelope is Greek and looks like me, only prettier, and at first she seemed very quiet and tame. But last night we discovered that she likes tequila and has a dirty mouth. 

Katherine is Australian, she was my first real friend here. She has never been away from home before, she has never left Australia, she has never lived alone before, and she is here by herself. She has a Nigerian boyfriend who runs and she recently lost her virginity as well. 

Kristine is Norwegian and we watch a lot of TV together. She chainsmokes and has fiery red hair and is beautiful and hates everyone and only likes to study. I have immense respect for her. 

There are others. But this is the core group, I'd say. These are the people I'll have pictures of and make everyone look at them and pretend to care. The other people are just the ones I know of and talk shit about.

I hope Leah is reading this because I just was daydreaming in my Critical Theory seminar today and I remembered how in high school and Middle school my student number was 21324, and Leah's was 45802. How random and nostalgic. Because it makes me realize how much Leah has been a part of my life. There was a time in middle school where Leah and I were in some sort of advanced algebra class together and grades would be posted by student number, and I would always check my grade as well as Leah's. Mine was always second to hers, which never really bothered me, because they were together. I think we both got over 100% in that class. Mrs. Whitmore, or something like that. Then Leah got even smarter, and I started to suck in math, how sad. 

Anyways, it's just funny how much nostalgia is mixed into those numbers 45802, 21324. I went to Les Miserables, minus the accent because I can't be bothered, which was amazing. Truly amazing. And I hate the word amazing. I saw it once when I was eight and it left a strong impression on me. I read the book in high school. I saw it visiting my grandparents in New York, my parents were in Mexico and we were already living in Arizona. But I specifically remember loving that show, and then going to Epstein's for matzo ball soup afterwards. Such a jew am I. But it was even better the second time, and I cried when Jean Valjean begs/sings to God to save Marius. The music was beautiful and I cried three or four times. 

I also went to this club this weekend, The Cafe de Paris, and got hit on, which seems to be a running theme here, Michael laughs on the phone over these accounts, saying you know Sivan, it's not in everybody's world that random people approach them, tell them they're beautiful, and profess their love. Well, I think it has something to do with Europeans, they are always asking you to marry them. I got asked out on a date walking from my flat to the tube this morning, which is a 2 minute walk.

I'm not feeling like a tourist anymore, just a foreigner. I'm depressed a little bit. But in control of my depression. I'm fasting today for Yom Kippur, but I accidentally had a bit of cookie when a girl in my class offered, I thought--yeah, I'm hungry not realizing why I was hungry. Because you're fasting you spacey retard. I am a space cadet, still I'm smart, but I tend to retreat into my own inner world at the expense of looking retarded frequently. 

It's cold. Also I think I want to go to grad school in Iowa, which has the best creative writing program in the nation, because even though it's in Iowa, I feel like I could do Iowa, but only if Michael comes too. Otherwise I'll have to go somewhere cool."

Tonight I think I'll sleep in mittens and a scarf, and a snow hat. It's probably not that cold, at least objectively. But cold is a sensation, a subjective thing, and as you all know I sure do have a knack for getting chilly.

This morning I was cold again, which makes it difficult to leave the bed. I can't be bothered (hee hee) to get up in the morning. So after my shower, when it was especially freezing. I blow-dried (I still think it should be blew-dry) my entire naked body with the blow-dryer. I was great! Then I got on the tube, an always hot experience, and reveled in the swampy temperature of London underground. 

I've made friends with my professor, they're called tutors here. He's quite ugly. But sexy, first because he's a tutor, and second because he's smart. Today I came late to class because I got lost, and then after class he came to talk to me, because I've had him for another class too. I said ""So sorry I was late, I got lost.""
He said: ""yes, you've been very naughty this morning."" 
!!!!!!!!
It's weird because naughty here doesn't have the same kinky connotation that it does in the States, but even being aware of that, I turned quite red. His name is Nigel, how cute is that?! Have I mentioned I'm working on a story? I'm giving it time, to really develop it, it's been too long since I've written a complete, good story. 

Michael's coming in early November to visit me. I'm so excited. It feels like I've been here forever. Being on the airplane seems like ages ago. I think it's because of the intense highs and lows that this experience has given me so far. It makes it feel longer. That's all for now. I miss all my friends at home."

Apparently so was one of the Pop Idol ex-stars. Pop Idol is like American Idol and all the brits are fucking crazy over reality TV. Somehow this isn't as intolerable as it would be in the states, probably because they all run around with accents and are generally smarter than we are. 

I've been drunk every night without fail. How awful, I know. Last night I met my friend Ian (from skyview) and him and his boyfriend took me to a gay club in Soho, which makes me think of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or Jack the Ripper. And we went to London Chinatown and ate in McDonald's. I'm still high on life, but that is one of the stages of culture shock I've been told, and after that comes homesickness and depression. I'm more lovesick than homesick at the moment. Missing my little poochkie every second. 

Today I went to the Rose Gardens in Regent's Park. It was quite idyllic with the ducks and the roses and the bees and the weeping willows.

Wayne did a Michael Jackson dance that he had been working on since he was a kid. Ben did a hilarious impression of Americans. Then I did an impression of a Long Islander, and then one of a Southerner, and they both fell in love with me. Then I told them I had a boyfriend. And Ben acted as if his heart was broken, it was very ridiculous. Some other random Indian boy stopped me on my way to the bathroom to specifically tell me that I was beautiful, which can only make you feel good, really. 

Going to a club is unusual because I don't really like clubs and I'm antisocial. But I had this whole mental breakdown the other day and called Michael up hysterical on the phone. He gave me some good advice about risking rejection and being more social and not sitting in my room crying. He always gives me this kind of tough love and at first it makes me mad, but then I always realize that he is right. And already in the week I've been here I've realized how much I need Michael, not just a boyfriend, but Michael specifically. I'm having fun now, and I do like the independence of this time in my life but Michael makes me feel so balanced. He compliments me perfectly. I think we compliment each other well.

Relationships are not so much about the two individual people, but about the dynamic that those two personalities develop with each other. Sometimes there's friction, and friction can feel good, I see the mental image of a braking train, there are sparks, but still it's dangerous. 

Other relationships are more complimentary. There is less friction and deeper understanding. 

I have both kinds of relationships, but I seem to have only one with each person in my life. I seem to have both with Michael, where we both can be argumentative and strong, but we both hold the relationship as the primary value, and so the friction never becomes unbearable."

I thought I was pregnant for some time there and I had images of running to Lynne at the Study Abroad office because she is my image of mother here. She is nice and blonde and has cute outfits and I've decided if I'm ever in trouble then she is my mother. But I got my period! Which is so so great because at least I'm not pregnant. Everybody hated me on family stay weekend, the other 3 kids that is, actually only two of them, one was nice, but somehow the other two ostracized me because I didn't want to drink both because of my bladder and the flu, so I think they thought I was uncool. 

The family we stayed with was this old Jewish couple, the woman was completely insane. Literally. And the weekend consisted of Robin Hood humor and trips to castles and such and having the flu and getting some stuff to soothingly squirt on my pillow that is the equivalent of Vicks Vapor Rub. Ah ah, good. 

Now I moved into my dorm and I'm out of money and my credit cards aren't working even though they are supposed to be and all the exchange places are closed so I have a few quid (yay!) on me and no way to buy a phone card or call home or do anything except for go to the internet cafe which I randomly stumbled upon after going by myself to a pub to drink a pint of cider because that was cheaper than dinner and it would get me full. I'm pleasantly buzzed and after a few nights of crying and misery and a phone call from Michael I'm feeling much better. Like I might actually be able to handle all this, especially not being pregnant. Today I got lost coming off of the tube, trying to find my dorm, holding a big plastic bag of my stuff that was quickly breaking and a nice man helped me out but I tried not to smile too much because apparently Americans smile too much, and we have straight white teeth that the brits can't afford because their dental is too expensive and so we shouldn't do too much showing off of the pearly whites whilst we are here lest we get killed by loads of brits. There's some brit grammar for you. They like to say ""loads"" and ""mate"" and ""cutlery"" and they have far to many words for coats, and apparently you should never say ""I'm stuffed"" because that means screwed. Chips are to fries, as Crisps are to Chips, but all that is all right because there is blood dripping out from my vaginal hole and my dorm room is cute and the walls are painted peach and I'm pleasantly buzzed off my dinner."

"event","I'm here in an internet cafe where this Russian lady was very rude today, and I'm actually in London where it's not insufferably hot. Today was long and emotionally high and low, which makes me feel good. Today I was very competent and I'm feeling very proud of myself, I already accomplished many things using only my good sense and a map, although I've probably already been ripped off twice. 

My greatest hope is to be a loner here, which I find romantic. It's so strange I go from feeling absolutely desperate to elated and then back and forth and back and forth. But I already made annoying friends, we all latched right onto each other very shallowly and split taxi cabs and pretended we cared a great deal about each other. But every American here is so pathetic that you can't help but almost like them. I went to buy a prepaid calling card to put in my cell phone (!) and I really didn't understand what the man was saying so I kept having to ask him to repeat himself, and he must have thought very little of me. 

Although this trip is sort of pampered with all sorts of study abroad program hand-holding I still feel brave for going half way across the world by myself, and for organizing this whole thing myself, and for my desire to want to spend this time independently. So let me be the first to congratulate myself, usual wimp that I am, for being brave."

You will find me two times, next to the coyote and looking lovingly at Dr. Keith Miller, the previously anonymous professor from one of my first lj posts, who I was convinced would have sex with me during his office hours. He is head of the English Department and loves me. Sadly, you may recall that my prophesy was incorrect. Here's something interesting, you know how you can dub someone a false prophet. Their prophesies don't come true. Guess who said that? God, actually. So where does that leave Jesus? I don't mean to outrage people. But Jesus, c'mon.

In other news, I might just be done with this livejournal thing. And this isn't just one of those fake-outs so that you'll beg that I stay. Not that anyone would give two shits. But more importantly, lj has and always will depress me. It started out where I read it psychotically in the beginning of fall semester so I could read about db's love of Caitlin and cry at the library. Then I was a little obsessed when I first opened my own account. And now it just makes me want to die. And I want to keep it because it's like a calendar, and it helps me remember quirky anniversaries. But I don't know, I feel like when I go away, I just won't have the energy for this forum. 

I don't know I don't have the heart to give it up, a recurrent theme in my life. I wish I could just let go of things that obviously suck.

But that was a fake-out. I take it back. Don't hate me for this post."

I read a lot of magazines like Us weekly and the Enquirer that showed up at Leah's apartment. 

Then Leah and I had a sad goodbye and I said you'll never see me again, which is not true, but has a nice drama to it. I'm actually leaving very soon, I can tell because I am being overwhelmed with Study Abroad paperwork, pamphlets and newsletters about how pubs=bars so don't be scared, and don't bring too many shoes.

We went to this scrapbook store that is so cute it could kill me. My mother said that because now that she may have cancer she started freaking out (not about dying mind you, but because we don't have all her recipes). 

She's so funny. We all know she doesn't really have cancer, but she got an MRI just to make sure and she'll find out for sure in a few days. I think the tone of this post may be inappropriate, because it's so lighthearted, but really nobody really thinks that this cancer scare is legitimate, so we're all in the best of moods. 

Also at the scrapbook store they had gaudy London-themed stationery with the UK flag and a two story-bus and I wanted to buy it. But then I thought about how I'd sit around and paste paste paste til I got high and my eyes fell out, all nostalgic for London while I was there. And I'd never leave my dorm and then I'd have to go home. So maybe I should actually do things.

I can't believe I'm going in less than a month. SCARY. SCARY. Scary superSCARY."

I realize that I have no ways to entertain myself, and thank god for my parents and my job or I would be too bored easily. I don't know what to do with myself. God fucking self-indulgent livejournal. I wasn't paying attention to Nurhan the other day, I was reading my lj friends' page, and he was desperately seeking Sivan's attention and so he said ""yeah, yeah, all your friends are depressed, blah blah, now pay attention to me."" He was drunk and I had to laugh. What a pointless endeavor this is. 

Leah is sad that I'm getting married because that means that she will have no chance. Maybe I'll get married this weekend, if Mikey agrees and if I get superbored. If not, then either during my year off or after grad school. Leah wants to get married when she's 27, but I told her that was stupidly American and that she'd be fat and ugly in her wedding dress. Alex was also sad that I might be fastly unavailable for life partnership. 

If Michael leaves me, for being a whiny bitch with diarrhea, then I'll marry Leah, then Alex, then Michael Bauer, then my mom. That's the hierarchy of my perceived compatibility of life partners."

If I was a thirteen year old boy and Michael Jackson wanted to tuck me into his bed, I would be quite pleased with myself, and if he molested me, I'd be ecstatic. Of all the kids he could molest, he chose me, frankly, that's flattering.

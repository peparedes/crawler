"event","i finally moved into my new place. its a nice little townhouse in a student complex. my room is coming along, i dont really have any furniture. but i got all my clothes to magically fit into my closet. my roommates are beyond strange... its cool though i think we'll get along. I'm supposed to be writing a paper, but my head is all foggy i needed to clear my head first. the night before i moved into my new place john kicked me out for being selfish and not sharing my granola bars. i'm glad to be rid of him, we havent talked since. my charger and really ugly wine glasses are at his house and its very important that i retrieve them. I'm gonna go while hes not home and leave the key for him. my roomies told me they go away pretty much every weekend. which is cool but this is a pretty big place for one person. i need fun parties to go to where i dont have to spend any money lol i'm way to poor. i had $8 and change and i went to walgreens and spent $7 and change on cigarettes...good choices. ughh i feel like i'm never gonna get this work done and on tuesday i start my fourth class. US Gov. wow i'm really not very excited for this. oh well maybe i should start getting my wilfred owen on.&nbsp;"

"event","3.30.06 was the last time i logged on here. a lot of my previous posts were for my eyes only, the first line of my last entry stated that i always end up coming back on livejournal when i'm really loosing my mind. Only this time i don't care whose reading. I'm 22 years old now. strange. i was not even old enough to drink the last time i posted. I most definately a totally different person from when i was 19. I dated a cop for a little over a year and a half. after we broke up i needed to get away. being around him is to hard for me, i'm a total cop-out but its something i'm cool with at this point in time. i came down to florida where my mother had been living for a year. its been 4 months. I'm currently at an ex-boyfriends house. not so cool. hes a mean selfish person. its almost two in the morning and i've been kicked out again for not wanting to share the granola bars his grandmother gave me for school. its all gravy cause i'm moving into my new super cool townhouse on wednesday. lets just hope my roommate and i get along because if i have to deal with someone being up my ass, or just being an asshole in general...well i dont know whats gonna happen but its not going to be pretty. Mal said to me that she couldent believe that i would put up with all of scruffo's shit, but my mother lives over an hour from school, scruffo lives 5 mins. its just a convience for me...or it was at first. now its just not worth it. 2 days seems so far. i mean really its like 1 day and 1 night. cause i can move my stuff in bright and early. im so tired. but im scared of sleeping alone in the living room. he told me to sleep in my car. hes sooo awesome...maybe one day i can be happy. maybe if i didnt try so hard to be loved, someone would come along that sincerely cares about my feelings. i dont think im that bad of a person, sure i can be a bit flakey but we all have our flaws. my eyes hurt real bad. anyone got some visine?"

"event","<FONT size=2>10 mins ago i wanted to crawl up in my bed and cry...life is just so odd right now. i work all the time. i go to bars. and for the mnost part im alone in my head. mal has mike. kims at school and even if she wasent its not like a 5 min car ride anymore so i wouldent see her that much anyway...and i dont really like my other friends that i see on a normal basis. so that leaves me with nothing. but usually im at work which is sad. but its my life so whatever. well mallory's birthday is april 15th so on april 16 were renting a limo to the city going to a club and staying in a hotel after. sounds like fun except i would be the only one without a date except joe. but over my dead body would i accept him as my date. so its been really bothering me the past week or so. and i didnt want to ask craig if he would go with me cuz of his fear of the city. and hes the only person i want with me. i had people who would be my dates but i kept putting it off and it wasent really appealing to me cuz i miss craig so much. so i brought it up to him tonight and he said he wanted to go...so im really really excited now. i hope he goes im not getting my hopes up. but i dont think he would fuck me over like that. and if he was like that i wouldent want him to be there anywhere so i guess it would be better off. and then i could settle for someone else. but i realllllly hope he goes...im having such a good night i think im just gonna go to sleep before someone realizes im awake and comes in to ruin my night :) oops to late now the kids are in here...oh well nite nite</FONT>"

"event","So it all starts out sunday night. there are no amtraks from ct to penn early in the morning which is the only time my bummy ass can get a ride to the train station. so kim decides to go home...the only problem being shes locked out of her house. hours go by as we try and figure a way to break into her house. so she figures oh well i'll just wing it. so the next day adam and jim pick her up from the train station and head back to her house to break in. jim sugests that they just try the front door just in case and what do u know...its open craigs home. so everything is all fine and dandy til kim realizes her car is not there and her parents took it to the train station *they're in mexico* so kim plans on asking craig if she can take the taho hes says no then finally caves in and she comes to my house we drink and smoke a little bit all is fine and dandy and in a few short hours we'll be seeing conan...if only it were that easy we get woken up at like 7 in the morning by the loudest horn ever. we didnt really think anything of it until my mother came in my room and asked kim whos suv that was...it was hers obviously and there was a big ass garbage truck that cant get through since i live on the smallest street known to man. so kim gets up and goes to move the tuck and the garbage man yells at her. so we go back to sleep and wake up get dressed and head to kims house...the train leaves at 12:30 and were females so naturally we finish getting ready at like 12:20..we get down the block and realize we dont have the weed...but we have 2 choices and not much time before the light turns green...either we like two normal mature girls going to see the grooviest talk show around and forget the weed and just get on the train...OR like two retarted pot heads we can turn around get the weed and drive into the city...well since the two of us just happen to be retarted pot heads we decide to drive into the city. so at first you cant get directions online for nbc studios address or at least the one they give for conan so i had to call my mom and ask her how to get to the city...she tells me and pretty much and clear as day tells me i can either take the tunnel or i can go over the 59th street bridge...she tells me i should take the 59th street bridge cuz its free and easier to get there..but obviously two girls like me and kim driving in a ginormous suv in which shes not used to driving cuz she drives a little ford focus miss the exit for the 59th street bridge and have to obviously take the tunnel...heres a little tip my loves if you've never driven in the city in a car that your not used to driving high....dont take the tunnel....this is our first near death experience of the day the lanes are extreamly narrow and in between the two lanes are these rubber oranges polls..in which kim runs over. and into the next lane. so finally we get out of the tunnel alive and go to find nbc studios we end up going downtown insted of uptown but got right back on track and find nbc studios...we go to like 4 different parking garages and nobody will park this monster we're in...finally we park the truck and walk to the studios..naturally we head off in the wrong direction but realize what we did and back tracked..we get there everything is fine and dandy its 2:30 and we get online..we sit down and get yelled at cuz apparently theres a sign that says no sitting. so we stand up and i start to get really hot so hot that im sweating so kim tells me to take off my jacket..so i take it off..if anybody has ever passed out they know right before the start to black out everything starts to turn white...so that started happening and i told kim..she knows she feels my pain...so shes like sit down. and im like no i cant that guys gonna yell again so a few seconds go by and everything is black. my mind is sort of awake but i cant move or speak or see anything. so i sit down and i can sort of move again and i start fanning myself off..and kim runs to get me water...i drank my water and she got me a pretzle to eat then i was fine for the rest of the night as far as that goes. then we get into conan and sit down second row right in front of his desk. the show starts and it was the most amazing thing that could have ever happened to me. i got to see conan o'brien he is SOOOOOO skinny and his head is a lot bigger but boy was he as dreamy as ever. tom arnold was there hes a really nervous twitchy man..it was strange and he talked about his testicles pretty much the whole time. then rachel weiss from the mummy was there and she was so cute and sweet. conan was hysterical the bad was strange it was like flapper music from the 20's. so that ends and at the end of the show they asked us to watch a video of trimph so this way we can laugh at the parts that are funny so they can air that on the show. so we do that and that shit was funny and we leave cuz were starving. and we go eat at this place called charlie o's which the food was really really good..and as were leaving the band that we just saw on conan was playing there. so were on our way home there was no way in hell that we were taking the tunnel so we decide to take the queensbourough bridge..yet another bad idea the exit that we have to take to get on the bridge leads to this tiny little ledge hanging off the side of the bridge that we have to drive on..of course it was another extreamly narrow road. we thought we were gonna die for sure. we get off safely get off at the wrong exit turn around get to my house and nobodys home and i dont have my key we only had to wait like 15 mins but after the day we had it was just a perfect way to end the night...so now im sitting here after a long ass day of seeing the coolest most amazing talk show host ever...well now that i've shared my day i think i'll go relax and watch the episode on tv..cuz it was just that cool...."

"event","have i ever expressed my hatred for the holidays. i dont think i have. well let me explain. holidays round my way are never anything to get excited about the feeling we get is more like dred. lets see.. christmas eve with my father. well being that i havent spoken to him in a year my entire extended family will shoot me dirty looks and talk behind my back that should be lovely. christmas. well my mother is as morbidly depressing as i am so we dont really ""celebrate"" we eat. thats it. no presents under the tree. and i understand as much as the next person that christmas is not about presents. but ur forgetting my friends that the people saying this are usually people who get presents so not getting presents kinda sucks. call me spoiled but if u dont get presents its a little rough. and new years my personal favorite will most likely be spent alone since mal spends it with her family and im a big loser. so thats that. my holidays shall contiue to be like this until forever. so maybe next year i'll just give up. i mean i suppose theres still hope tomorrow and christmas may have a christmukkah miracle and maybe craig wont be gay and will ask me to do something. well mals having a contest with me right now to see who can get the most myspace friends cuz that truely shows how gay we are. so i'm gonna whoop her ass. sorry to be bunch a bum just needed to get it off my chest before i screamed at the top of my lungs. i hope everyone has a really really great holiday!"

"event","ok so 9:30 i wake up to get ready to go to the city with kim and michelle around 10:30 they call me and tell me that there on there way to my house to be ready. so they get to my house and im all ready or whatever and we planned to smoke b4 we got on the train so we wud have a super high...so we smoked like joint and a few bong hits. we walk to the train station its raining and we find out the train dosent come for another hour so since the train station is like 2 mins from my house we decide to walk to my house smoke more and drive back to the train station we walk half way up my block and see my father in my drive way and we were SOOOO high i was like freaking out and starting running in the other direction. and then he went the other way cuz he obviously noticed. we go in the house smoke another joint..are ripped out of our skull go back to the train station and go to the city...when took the strangest ride ever and ate AS SOON as we got there at applebees :) then off we went to buy a hooka that we would love and cherish...we come across one and it just glowed it was perfect.kim bought memento which we planned to watch while we christened the hooka. we went barnes and nobles and bought some books. came to my house and christened the hooka which now goes by the name of Sir Walter Babytables HAHAHAHHA we got the name babytables by taking apart sir walter babytables where we found that by using a disk u can use him as a table as well...well when we were watching memento it kept skipping and stopping and we realized the disk was broken. after kim and michelle left. i realized how the disk got ruined...by using it as a table top...so that mystery was solved..and im still REALLY high.and im gonna go smoke some more now.."

adam's a peice of shit broken promises over and over. i dont even know what to say about him. i hate the fact that no matter how much fucked up shit he does to me i cant stay mad at him.. i guess its cuz since the stuff he does to me isnt that bad and i know i'd get over it and since hes so private i dont know when id talk to him again so i just let it slide time and time again. its wrong that i do that i allow him to be an asshole. oh well i guess i'll just play the sims now."

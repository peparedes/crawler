<BR>
<font size=1>thirty-three years go by
and not once do you come home
to find a man sitting in your bedroom
that is
a man you don't know
who came a long way to deliver one very specific message:
lock your back door, you idiot
however invincible you imagine yourself to be
you are wrong

thirty-three years go by
and you loosen the momentum of teenage nightmares
your breasts hang like a woman's
and you don't jump at shadows anymore
instead you may simply pause to admire
those that move with the grace of trees
dancing past streetlights
and you walk through your house without turning on lamps
sure of the angle from door to table
from table to staircase
sure of the number of steps
seven to the landing
two to turn right
then seven more
sure you will stroll serenely on the moving walkway of memory
across your bedroom 
and collapse with a sigh onto your bed
shoes falling
thunk thunk
onto the floor
and there will be no strange man
suddenly all that time sitting there
sitting there on what must be the prize chair
in your collection of uncomfortable chairs
with a wild look in his eyes
and hands that you cannot see
holding what?
you do not know

so sure are you of the endless drumming rhythm of your isolation
that you are painfully slow to adjust
if only because 
yours is not that genre of story
still and again, life cannot muster the stuff of movies
no bullets shattering glass
instead fear sits patiently
fear almost smiles when you finally see him
though you have kept him waiting for thirty-three years
and now he has let himself in
and he has brought you fistfuls of teenage nightmares
though you think you see, in your naivete
that he is empty handed
and this brings you great relief 
at the time

new as you are, really, to the idea that
even after you've long since gotten used to the parameters
they can all change
while you're out one night having a drink with a friend
some big hand may be turning a big dial
switching channels on your dreams
until you find yourself lost in them
and watching your daily life with the sound off
and of course having cautiously turned down the flame under your eyes
there are more shadows around everything
your vision a dim flashlight that you have to shake all the way to the outhouse
your solitude elevating itself like the spirit of the dead
presiding over your supposed repose
not really sleep at all 
just a sleeping position and a series of suspicious sounds
a clanking pipe
a creaking branch 
the footfalls of a cat
all of this and maybe 
the swish of the soft leather of your intruder's coat
as you walk him step by step back to the door
having talked him down off the ledge of a very bad idea
soft leather, big feet, almond eyes
the kinds of details the police officer would ask for later
with his clipboard 
and his pistol 
in your hallway


<font size=2>yesterday i was thinking about stereotypes and labels.  i was thinking about all the different things i could be stereotyped as over the years and all the different things i wanted others to stereotype me as.  and then i was thinking about all the things i'd label myself as and what i wanted to stereotype myself as.  thats a hell of a lot of labels for one person.

and its weird how even tho everybody ""hates"" stereotypes, everyone WANTS to be labeled at the same time.  everyone wants to fit into a nice neat category, and know exactly who they are at all times, but its just not possible."

"event","jesse came up to school to visit with me and take me home for break last week.  He came up Sunday night and we left after i finished my math test on Wednesday.  It was so awesome to have him here, it really really was.  it was so strange though...like ""oh THIS is what its like to have a boyfriend on campus with you...who you can see whenever you want...as late as you want....as often as you want....""  so weird.  but awesome.  but yeah even just the 6 hour ride home was fun b/c I was with HIM.  He made quite the impression on all my gentlemen friends, too apparently lol.  Yeah-like 99.5% of guys here are gay, and a few of them were PRETTY infatuated with my boyfriend.  It was hilarious.  Oh wait...here I saved part of a convo w/Zach....allow me to copy and paste you a bit of the madness...
-------------------------------------

fresa1022: LOL jimmy nagel did!
music actually: he is beautiful.
music actually: there's no two ways around it
fresa1022: lol i agree...and dont u like his hair longish, the way it is?  he keeps wanting to cut it and i wont let him ! lol!
music actually: noooooo
music actually: do not
music actually: cut
music actually: the hair
fresa1022: lmao
fresa1022: thank you!!
fresa1022: he wont listen to me....i tell him its hotter this way
music actually: well
music actually: idk
music actually: i haven't seen it shorter
music actually: but it is wonderful long
fresa1022: it is
music actually: yea i wasn't expecting him to be much
music actually: because you never talked him up
music actually: but honey
music actually: you got yourself one hunk of man there
fresa1022: LOL
music actually: tell him if he ever wants to switch to the other side
music actually: ;-)
fresa1022: augh!  zach i am NOT telling him that!
music actually: lol please!
music actually: it's just funny! hahaa
fresa1022: zach!!!  lets not move in on each others partners now!
music actually: LMAO!!!!!!!!!!
music actually: i have no partner for you to move in on though haahaa
music actually: no fair
music actually: SHARE THE WEALTH THERESA
---------------------------------------------
yeah yesterday i drove back up here by myself...yes, that's right, the 93 Cam is officially here in all her flowered glory.  And she's officially been incredibly pimped out (I bought her a cd player).  I'm so excited to actually have a get-away car now lol.  It's so much more convenient when ur stuck in the middle of nowhere.

Besides that, well I'm back here in Potsdam, busy as hell and absolutely DYING for summer.  Its going to be an incredibly rough next 4 weeks.  I'm gonna cross my fingers and pray that I can handle it.  The weathers kinda crappy too, but it could definately be a lot worse so I'm not gonna complain.


Mmm im really craving applesauce for some reason..."

"event","well my brother woke me up blasting on his trumpet and he's still going strong, so i can't practice, do homework, or study, and my parents aren't here so I can't leave.  So I figured I'd update. lol.

Um I've been home since last Friday night (when we got towed).  I went to the high school musical last weekend and I can honestly say I was very impressed with how it all came together.  Also it was so great to see everyone.  I couldn't stay after the show b/c I had to work at 5 (it was the sunday show), but I did make-up Saturday and Sunday, so I got to chill w/everyone before the shows.  I was afraid it'd be awkward and people would be like ""um get out of here this is our show"" haha but they weren't it was so much fun and Kara was there too so i wasn't the only old person haha.  But yeah it was so great to see everyone and they all made me very proud.  

Basically for the rest of this week off I've been working, doing homework & practicing, going to the gym, seeing Jesse (altho I actually haven't seen him that much), and shopping for much-needed supplies (when I go home is when I stock up seeing as I go to school in the middle of nowhere). Fun fun.  Oh well I can't complain its just so nice to be out of Potsdam and the -20 to -30 degree weather.  It's been 30 degrees here all week and I've been in tank tops!


Anyways, last night was super fun.  Lynzie had a bunch of people over.  We all basically just chilled and watched Hitch (bootleg), which I just saw the other day, but I was down w/seeing again cuz it was sort of cute.  Then we decided to have a Mighty Taco party (one of the best ideas I've ever heard of).  It was SO funny.  There were so many of us, and it was after 1 am, so only the drive-thru was open, so we were all standing out in the cold in a huge crowd eating our food and like, dancing a little to stay warm (someones car was blasting music).  And when we were in the drive-thru line, I was like the biggest dumbass ever!!!!  I pulled up to the menu thing and was like ""oh let's check out the prices!"" and then after I looked at them, I DROVE FORWARD!  Before they could take my order!!!!!!   So then I had to beep my horn so the van behind me would back up and I had to back up and Lori had to order out the back window!!  lmao then go figure it was Janelle at the drive-thru window lmao.  So I totally embarassed myself in front of someone who actually knows me~

But yeah so then we were all chilling and it was like: me, lynz, lori mammoser, ryan rogers, ryan penna, steve schrieber, jamie bermingham, jess staub, lisa altherr, laura, dick, ...crap I don't remember who else.  Katie Gard and her bf were there earlier but the didn't go to Mighty.  But then Eve and Sara Ressing and Eve's bf showed up too which was hysterical!  We had a huge party, and then all these cars started pulling up getting together and it looked like they wanted to join the party, but we were ready to rumble lol.  So after some random guy tried to be cool and do some intense burnout things, we all drove away cuz we figured the cops were coming.  So I went back to Lynzie Rae's to take her home and Lori to her car and we ended up chilling there for a while longer just talking and stuff.  It was cool.  I didn't get home til really late tho and then well, you know the rest, Mark woke me up at 930 and btw I'm all swollen up and disgusting and having like, an allergic reaction or something so thats cute. lol pretty girl. hahaha.  awww i miss my girls on long island!"

lol yeah jen's car broke down in rochester and there wasn't enough room in the tow truck for all of us so me and brian got to ride in the car.  i don't really think that's legal...but it was sure fun!!!

(well except for the fact that there was no heat.....yeah my fingers and toes were white they were so frozen and we could see our breath in the car)

lol but still it was a fun, adventurous, and exciting experience!  And we spent lots of the car ride listening to Delilah hahahaha  gotta love that woman."

Seriously, I usually don't even like flowers, but they're breathtaking.  It's an arragement of pink lilies (LILIES ARE MY FAVE FLOWERS EVER), pink baby roses, and babies breath.  You seriously have to see them, you'd melt.  The boy scored some major points this V-day ahha.

"event","so im back at potsdam.  its about oh negative 200 degrees here.  no honestly, its about negative 15, and quite possibly the coldest and most frigid weather i have ever experienced in my life.  it literally takes your breath away the second you walk out the door.  but dont worry--heat wave next week....19 degrees....im definately busting out my bikini.  
.
me and amy are officially set up in our room...and it looks <i>awesome</i>.  it really does.  im so giddy about it haha.  of course, it literally took ALL day to set up because when we were trying to bunk our beds mine completely FELL APART.  I mean my bed shattered.  There was firewood all over our room.  Oh man.  but yeah, im excited cuz our room is real pretty and fun and spacious and i had a new mouse randomly laying around, so now my computer works properly again.  plus im having fun uploading pics with my new camera.  it rocks.  i just wish id gotten pictures with lynzie and kara and everyone i hung out with BEFORE i left for long island.  that makes me sad cuz they were a big part of my vacation and theyre not in any of my pictures at all.

but anyways yeah, im back in p-dam.  as of yet there have been no emotional breakdowns and i really do think this semester is going to be better.  so im gonna go with this feeling."

"event","OMG AMAZING WEEKEND!!!!!  It was so incredible and I can never, never thank my girls enough.  They took me w/them when they went home to Long Island this past weekend.  It was amazing.  Even the 7 hour drive was absolutely awesome.  I never knew I could have so much fun in a long car ride.  It was my first experience seeing NYC when we drove in Friday night, and it looked amazing, all illuminated.  Then Saturday Chris, Amy's bf (who's a pilot) took me and Amy flying in a small plane over Manhattan.  It was so incredible.  Not to mention it was absolutely gorgeous out and we got some incredible pictures of the sun rising over the water.  It was so awesome, I can't even describe it.  Then we went out to breakfast, and then Amy took me to Port Jeff, this gorgeous little nautical town that is just so ME!  For real.  I instantly fell in love with it.  We even went shopping in a couple of the little gift shops and got some jewelry.  They had some awesome beachy stuff, but there was also an Indian store that had the most incredible jewelry, belts, and purses...I can't wait to go back over Christmas!  Then we went to the beach.  OMG.  It was quite possibly the best beach I have ever seen in my life.  The sand was so fine and perfect, the water was so blue....it was ridiculous.  And the funny thing is that Amy told me that a lot of kids hate to go to that beach b/c its so rocky....but its not rocky at all, there's just amazing shells and smooth stones all over (which I collected some of to decorate my room w/ haha im such a dork!)  But yeah, after that we went out to Panera to meet up w/Cara, Christa, and their friend Katie.  Good times...I friggin love Panera (I've had it in Virginia before...its incredible) I wish we had one in Buffalo.  Then we chilled for a little while before having an incredible dinner that Mama Po (Amy's mom) prepared for us.  They have sit down dinners almost EVERY NIGHT.  I can't even fathom that.  I think we generally only do that on holidays.  And then me, Cara, and Christa went to see Christa's little bro in the high school drama.  He was so cute and funny!  And their school was ridiculous.  There were over 600 ppl in their graduating class, their school is ENORMOUS and shaped like a HAND OF ALL THINGS, and there's trailers all over cuz they're adding on to the school to make it even bigger.  But yeah, after the drama we went out and rented A Goofy Movie (amazing movie!) and Coyote Ugly (also incredible!) ha, but we only got about 10 mins into Coyote Ugly before me and Amy fell asleep, so we all just went to bed lol.  Sunday morning we got up, ran some errands, and made an awesome brunch for everybody's families.  I love all their families by the way...they're awesome.  Oh and all my friends live in friggin ridiculous houses.  I'm so jealous.  They need to teach Barbie a thing or two about interior decorating haha.  After that we hit the dusty trail.  Spirits were not quite as high on the way back due to a number of factors such as getting a speeding ticket and well, I was quite unhappy b/c I kind of lost something that's VERY important...not to mention we all had exams to dread.  Lol I had a piano test today and I have an anthro exam tomorrow morning. augh. lol.  Speaking of which, since I didn't get a whole lot of studying in, I should probably at least get some sleep for that thing lol.

So I'm out.

Thanks again, girls, for an absolutely fantastic weekend!!!  I can't thank you enough!!!"

"event","I quit cheerleading...and I'm honestly very relieved that I did.  I also wanna give myself props for admitting for once when something was just too much for me.  Usually I'm a stubborn little asshole and I just suck it up and deal, but then I end up having like, mental breakdowns. ha.  But yeah, with my music major, I just really couldn't handle it.  Cheering here is a HUGE committment, not to mention that its rather embarassing.  Yeah, it is.  It's not like high school at all.  The squad has potential for good mounts, but do you think we can show those off at hockey games?  No, we just sit there and clap our poms and look like retards.  Plus, one of the captains is an extreme bitch and I just really couldn't deal with her.  It's sad, because I *LOVE* cheering, and I love most of the girls on the squad, and I really like the coach and I *love* THE UNIFORMS, and I love the fact that we get all this free shit and it counts as a PE credit...but I really just don't have the time for it.  It's just additional stress that I don't need right now.  Not to mention I have a ton of concerts for Studio that I'm required to go to that completely conflict with practices.  So I quit.  And now I'm free.  Well except for the little matter of Crane owning my soul.  Ha.  Maybe I'll just quit that, too lol."

"event","So apparently I'm a Potsdam Bears Cheerleader...lol

Yeah so I know I'm a total hypocrite cuz I was totally bashing them, and then yesterday one of them came up to me and asked me to try out and I was like ""why do u need people that bad? oh ok I guess I will.."" lol and here I am, a college cheerleader lol.  Except its not like most college squads where theyre AMAZING and huge and coed and everyone can tumble like whoa and such....nope...this squad currently has like 12 girls on it and a few of them have absolutely no cheering experience whatsoever lol.


But honestly, lately I've been missing cheering so much, so I'm actually kind of excited.  Even though we cheer for um, hockey?  And basketball.  Lol.  That's cute hahaha.  And we have to come back super early from Christmas break which SUCKS.  And I'm worried about being way too busy and stressed w/all my music and stuff, not to mention straining my voice (cuz I kinda need it!!!!).  But I guess I'm just gonna play things by ear and see how things go.  

And to be honest, I've got to admit the squad has SOME potential.  A few of the girls are really good.  The 2 captains, another sophomore, and even a couple of the freshman are def pretty good.  One of the captains, Kim, went to Nationals w/her high school COED team and WON ALL FOUR YEARS!!!  I was like HO-LY SHIT.  Lol.  

But yeah, they thought I was pretty good, I picked up on stuff fast, my motions were really sharp (the insides of my arms hurt already haha), and I actually did pretty well when I was thrown into a couple mounts basing and backing.  So they said I'm gonna be like the wildcard that can do both things, and gets thrown into either whenever they need me.  Sweet.  Hehe they did happen to mention that we will be working on our jumps a lot, so not to worry. hahahahaha yeah I know mine suck ass. lol.  It's all good. 

But yeah so we'll see how this whole college cheering thing goes...I'm kinda excited...even tho it's gonna take up a LOT of my time!"

We looked like Jane Fonda!!!  We really only did it to see the reactions we would get and cuz we thought it'd be funny.  Cuz we always go to the gym looking SUPER gross...all sweaty and wearing like, non-matching clothes.  Baggy t-shirts and boys gym shorts, etc.  And we always get hit on and we're like WTF.  So we decided to go dressed all hardcore 80s and see if we got the same reaction! haha consider it an experiment.  lol.  But yeah, it was absolutely ridiculous.  The people in my hall thought we were INSANE.  But I mean, come on, it's Potsdam!  We've gotta do SOMETHING to amuse ourselves!!!!"

Jess:  You were talking in your sleep last night
Theresa:  Oh really?  I don't usually do that.  What'd I say?
Jess:  Were u dreaming about transferring schools?
Theresa:  hahaha I could have been! lol! (i dont remember any of my dreams last nite)
Jess:  Yeah cuz I was sitting at my computer and you were sleeping and I had my headphones on and all of a sudden I heard you talk and I looked over and your lips were moving.  So I was like 'Are you awake?'  But you were sleeping.  But you spoke coherent sentences, which I was impressed by b/c normally people just mumble when they sleep.  But you were like <b>'I'm going to take a pickture of the school, and then I'm going to leave.'</b>

Fun parties w/the girls and basically just dying laughing about the stupidest things ever hehe like our awesome moose conversations (which is now our official symbol, and yes, we're makin shirts hahaha) and Christina's pancreotic cancer lol.

Haha and now I'm officially an honorary Long Island Girl hehe and according to Christina (who was not quite at her senses at the time) I am the QUEEN BEE of the ICP. baahahah.  Nice.  LOL.

Anyways, today I had piano and guitar.  Both quite easy, and the piano teacher was even impressed b/c I could sight read both clefs at once.  whoop-dee-friggin-doo they were quarter and half notes lol.  ILT was boring and I zoned out a lot as usual.  Then me and Amy hit the gym, I talked to the Jesster on the phone, I went to Phoenix (women's chorus), practiced, then went to my friggin LONG COMP class, where, as usual, we did NOTHING!  UGH!  It's so long, too, I dread that class for like, days on end.  Fun dinner w/the girls, minus Christa who went to dinner earlier w/the Alley boys, and now me and Amy are going to the gym again lol.  And yet again, I do NOT think I'm gonna do my laundry haha.  Haven't done it yet, don't really wanna start now, maybe tomorrow lol.

So yeah, I'm off to the gym to lose the like, 9 bajillion pounds i just gained at dinner b/c i ate a piece of pizza, salad, AND ice cream and a cookie.  I'm so gross and I just keep getting grosser, but I WILL NOT succumb to the dreaded Freshman Fifteen, that I assure you!"

"event","Well, second day here at Potsdam was a success.  Me and my roommate are actually pretty close and altho I was pretty scared about having a scary roommate before I came, she's really cool and we get along great.  Also I met up w/my ICP posse today and actually I think we're gonna be headin out to a party in a little while.  We had our freshman concert today (where we had an hour to learn the music) but I LOVE our director.  He is AWESOME.  I'm really excited to work with him now.  He seems like a great teacher and he's really funny.  I still haven't met my private teacher and me and 2 other kids were kinda freaking out cuz we still havent found him to sign up for lesson times.  We're gonna go search him out tomorrow I think.  OH and I found an accompanist!  It's this piano major from Tokyo.  (exchange student) Her name's Erika (I know, not the most ethnic of names) and she's super pretty and apparently she's like, an amazing pianist b/c she was like ""you might want to get a back-up accompanist b/c i might get a big scholarship to a better school and move"" lol.  allright then hehe.  But yeah so far so good.  Oh and my phone froze like a mother today but fortunately Jess knew exactly how to fix it.  Allright well a bunch of us girls are gonna watch Dirty Dancing in here and then I think I'm gonna go visit Brian.  And later....maybe a party!"

"event","Well last nite was crazy.  I got out of work after like 45 mins. b/c Johnny decided to let me go home and pack woo!  So I went home, packed some more, and then me and Jesse went to get minutes for his new cell phone (my old one hehehe....hey those numbers were just too good to let them go to waste!  
997-2016!!)

We chilled a little and I gave him his present and yes, we are official again, despite anything that friggin Nick Fatta thinks (yes I know Im fat and ugly)

Then me and Lynz decided to haul it out to Fredonia to see Kevin, Sarah, Andy, Adam, Bonnie, and EVERYONE else at Fredonia (like Laura, Ryan, Newland hehe, Lindsey, etc.)

Yeah so about 5 minutes from the Fredonia exit, Lynzie's car (Bluey) starts like, making all these crazy noises and shaking and stuff, so we're like ""TURN THE RADIO UP!!!!!  BLAST IT OUT!!!!!"" bahahahaha so we're like blasting the music as loud as it can go so that we don't have to hear the car making freakish noises lol.  So then Bluey started to smell a lil like burnt rubber/plastic, and then Lynzie's gas pedal just sank down to the floor so she pulled off onto the side of the road and turned the car off.  Then we couldn't get it started back up and it smelled really bad and was smoking a lot hehe.  And the temperature gauge-thingy was up in the red section so we figured maybe we'd just give Bluey a few minutes to chill and it'd return to normal and we could drive away.  Well after like an hour, Bluey returned to the Normal section, but she was havin none of it.  So we were stranded on the thruway for like an hour before we decided to let Lynnie and Jay come pick us up.  We passed the time calling like, everyone in our cell phones (who had cell phones cuz we didnt wanna call houses and wake parents up) hehehe just to find someone to help us pass the lonliness lol!  Then when we were done w/that, we decided if the car couldn't work, the stero certainly still could and we ended up doing some of the best car dancing of our lives.  

In the end we got rescued but Bluey was left stranded on the thruway.  But we didn't care about that.  All we could think about was gummies. hehehe.  So yeah, Mrs. Collard drove to the Fredonia exit and turned around and guess what it was definately 2 minutes away.  Rock on.  We were so close yet still so far away hehe.  Awwww and I wanted to go visit all those little buggers lol. 


Ok well today is my last day in Eden and guess what I'm spendin it like a champ:  gyno appointment, last minute packing, and traffic court!  WOOO!  ugh.  Goodbye everyone from Eden!  I would like to say I love u all but I def don't!!!  But I do love a lot of you!"

"event","I have one word to describe last night: AMAZING!!!!

Seriously it was so awesome I cannot even begin to tell you.  So many hilarious memories were made just in one night its ridiculous.  

First me, Isabel, and Jill went downtown for the concert.  We got there, found a grassy knoll on which to sit, and we ended up seeing Marcus, Ryan Penna, Laura Pruchnicki, Jess Staub, Matt Youhess, and Veronica.  So we chilled w/them.  The opening act SUCKED.  he was so terrible and all his songs were like ""I HATE YOUR KIDS!  I WANT TO BURN THEM!""  or his other classic song ""FUCK IT!!!!"" hehehe  Around then it went from blistering smoldering heat to freezing cold rain and gusts of wind.  AUGH!  And everyone was pretty miserable.  We stole a blanket from a neighboring kid and then i called Val on her cell, so her, Nick, Mary, Kevin, Mary's cousin, and Lindsey Ohmit came over and met up w/us and we had a huge Eden posse.  Later Erica came for a little while w/her 3 cousins.  So yeah Me, Maeve, and Veronica went up front for Ani (who was awesome btw, even tho the only song she played that is one of my faves was Shy...I was really hopin she'd play Both Hands, Gravel, Not A Pretty Girl, and 32 Flavors).  It was raining super hard and we were in literally 2 feet of water by this time. augh! hehe
ok ive gotta run but ill finish the story later and get to the AMAZING part of the nite! OMG it was so much fun!!!!  Def one of the best times I've had so far this summer!!!!"

We drove around Hamburg, browsed about in Dollar Tree, flicked people off, got cut off like 18 times by some wild drivers, hit DQ, ANNNNNND applied to be ""busgirls"" at MANCHURIAN HOUSE. LMFAO IT WAS SO FUNNY.  Cuz we walk in there, and the only people in there are these 4 Chinese people who work there on their lunch break, and the one woman comes out and is like ""can i help you?"" and im like ""yes...we'd like applications."" and SIMULTANEOUSLY all their jaws DROPPED.

I was laying outside on a lawnchair on my pool deck (I had just finished a strenuous afternoon of job-hunting and application gathering and filling out) and all of a sudden I heard something that sounded like the grass rustling.  So I looked up (I was laying on my stomach facing away from the pool) and RANDOMLY Bobby Sachs is standing at the bottom of my pool deck WATCHING me.  Then he started talking to me as if it was perfectly normal for him to be chillin in my backyard when I was unaware of it.  I have never talked to this kid in my life and he's all ""hey therese, so where ya goin to college?  How'd that Kenny thing at the legislative office go?

"event","...a good title for me I think...well, sometimes.  Ok, let's face it, I often do a lot of breaking.  But I'm working on it.  I'm getting better at dealing.  I'm building endurance for when times get rough, you might say.

Saturday was THE KENNYS.  I did not want to go.  At all.  I thought it was gonna be SUCH a colossal waste of a Saturday.  
Boy, was I wrong.  I left the house at like 10:30 am to go get Eve and drive her and Molly over to their mom's house so Eve could get her character shoes.  Good times!  hahah classic car dancing!  I'm so glad we're friends again.  (There was a very long period during elementary school and jr high where we despised each other...I think it was a competition thing).  Anyways, believe it or not, we've matured.  :0)

Then we went to the Kenny's after a super fun and remeniscent busride.  At the Kenny's we warmed up onstage and took a BORING tour of Shea's that including like, no cool spots in the theater.  Then we had a looong waiting period where we ate a lot of food, met Meredith Lipke in the elevator illegally, and basically just chatted it up and had a good ol' time.  I talked to Lisa and Jesse, and I saw Taylor onstage but I didn't see her to talk to her after.  Next the show began, some of the younger girls decided I should give a pep talk.  (ha cuz im so good at those!? LOL) It was super retarded but at least everyone actually listened to my ramblings haha.  I told them about how when I was three, I saw CATS (my first musical!) at Shea's.  I was so excited by the way the actors came right out into the audience and how awesome all the dancing and singing was, and at that moment, I decided that someday I would perform at Sheas. And here we were, about to perfom AT SHEAS.  Well I think that's just awesome and congrats on all of us (esp the adults involved) just for making it THAT far!!!

Then during the show we did good although my voice was a lil raspy and far back in my throat.  Damn.  But its ok, cuz everyone else did awesome.   All the other schools were really good, though, and we were the underdogs so I definately did NOT think we would win.  Not a chance.

So each school got called up for its spotlight award.  We got stage design.  (Yeah Cindy Sweich!!!)  Then came the special awards.  These awards are individual but they only go to people who do not win the BIG award (kind of to spread out the recognition of talent).  No one from Eden won any, although I half expected Ryan to win for leading actor.  Then came the big one...yes, the $5000 check, the medals, the shadowbox, the assembly...the whole shebang....

everyone was holding hands and shaking and nervous and I was all ""dont be guys, obv we didn't win"" and then Lipke announced it....
EDEN JR/SR HIGH SCHOOL!!!!

aughhH!!!!!  I think we all went crazy for about 3 hours! LITERALLY!!!  we were shocked and overjoyed and shocked again.  

It was awesome.

And Erica reminded me that we really and truly have had an incredible year as far as extracurriculars go.  We had an AMAZING cheerleading season.  We did awesome, and the football team nearly went all the way.  It was incredible.  And now we've won the Kenny's!!

Ok, after a whole bunch of us went out to dinner at Chef's and I got home around quarter after 11.  

I went to Lynzie's and slept over.

In the morning...DASHBOARD.  We drove to West Seneca to get the boys and then we drove over to Niagra Dome.  When we pulled into the parking lot (at like 1) Maeve was like ""HOLY CRAP, THATS THE GET UP KIDS!!!!""  Cuz there was a group of guys that looked suspiciously like rock stars standing outside the tour busses.  

We FREAKED out.  We went over there, feeling incredibly creepy and stalkerish, and MET CHRIS CARRABBA AND THE GET UP KIDS!!!!!  I got Chris to sign my shirt and I got a picture w/him.  They even invited us to gamble w/them haha.  And we invited them to come eat hot dogs w/us.  LOL.

Later we chilled in the parking lot and played lacrosse and frisbee and such.  Good times.

Then we got in line at like 3 and I complained.  A LOT.  I was pissy.  let's face it, I had had a bad week and was on like, no sleep.
while we were waiting in line, we saw mike marsh, so of course we went over and started a convo.  (hes the dashboard drummer).

But yeah, the concert was so worth it.  I got a shirt, and a pick from Say Anything.  I had front row.  I even got to go BEHIND the barricade for Thrice and like, sit on the stage!  Me and Jill were the only ones back there.  It was quality.  TINY hooked us up hehehe!  (a HUGE bodyguard, and yes his name was Tiny) Get Up Kids were AWESOME, even though they only played songs off their new cd, which I dont have.  They were still incredible.  And Say anything was good too, and Thrice was actually really good even tho they were super hardcore and I got shoved into a speaker haha.  and then.....DASHBOARD.  amazing.  Simply amazing.  He played both old and new songs, solo and with the band.  and he was SO GOOD.  For real.  he even MENTIONED US onstage!!!!  He was all ""This has been one of the best tour locations...etc...It's been so fun...we even got invited to a barbeque earlier!""  WOO!  lol hehe. The only bad thing about it was that I was right by the exit so all the sick ppl kept having to go by me and they were all gross, and there were these two OBNOXIOUS girls behind me screaming along, so I was really angry.  EXCUSE ME BUT I DID NOT PAY TO COME HERE AND HEAR <b>YOU</b> SING!!!!  But yeah.  Awesome.  And we talked to Chris (Carrabba) again after the show.  He signed my ticked and we chatted it up (a little!).  He really was pretty cool, although I guess he has to be for publicity anyways lol.  He's so tiny!!! He's only 5'5"" (I'm 5'6"") and he's WAY skinnier than me!!! LOL I was like, wow I feel enormous.  lol

But yeah, terrific evening, thanks guys I had such a blast!!! 
I didn't get home til like 1 am and I had to go to school this morning but it was all good!  

I HOPE INCUBUS TURNS OUT THIS AWESOME!!!!!"

"event","I have to decide where to go to college by TOMORROW!!!

The choices are down to POTSDAM vs. FREDONIA.

but i honestly DONT KNOW WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE!!!  originally i was leaning Potsdam, but now that I look at it again, I feel like all my reasons for Potsdam are not exactly related to the music program (which would be a rather important thing to consider).

Potsdam:

PROS: its far away, 200 eden kids arent going there, its a good enough school, its giving me more money

CONS: its in the middle of nowhere, its cold

Fredonia:

PROS: Tylock said the voice teachers are better, there's more student organizations, i had an awesome audition there and my judge (who used to be my old voice teachers old voice teacher) had me singing better than ive ever sung before in only a matter of 5 minutes of vocal warm-ups, i'd get better student-teaching opportunities, theres tons of practice rooms

CONS: its more expensive, its right around the corner, i practically grew up there every summer at camp, like 200 eden kids are going there (and about 3 into the music program), i hate dr. lang, the campus isnt as fun.

Yeah, you should probably help me decide, as im pretty pressed for time here!"

"event","Last Monday me, Andrea, and Katie Gard went to get our bellybuttons pierced!~  Holy crap it was quite an adventure lol!  We were super scared and we were such obnoxious assholes at the piercing place ahaha CHRIS wanted to shoot us!  lol  But it was a lot of fun and we got coffee and went to the mall afterwards...good times.  I love those girlies.  

Anyways, this past weekend was the AMAZING production of JOSEPH ha.  Actually it went pretty well.  I can't believe my days of Eden musicals are over...wow...so many memories i cant even begin to describe.  haha all throughout the shows i kept telling everyone that i wanted to be jasmine and i felt like jasmine in that costume, so nick fatta got me a stuffed tiger ((rajah)) for my senior present, and jess sinicki colored me a pic of jasmine in red (my color!).  I was so excited i hung it in my locker haha.  At the Sunday Cast party I did my speech about Mrs. Tylock and I read part of the Fredonia essay that I wrote about her.  As soon as I started reading the essay I started crying and didnt stop for the whole speech...and i didnt even care.  I mean, she is totally my hero in like, every way and now I'm graduating and this was my last show w/her ever.  After I gave my speech I got a standing ovation...I guess everyone else feels the same way that I do on that one.  

Now that the play's over you'd think I'd have tons of time, but I dont.  I really never do.  Plus now I gotta get serious about getting in shape and not gorging myself on everything in sight 24 times a day.  Hm this is gonna be difficult lol.  

yeah.  Today was Saint Patrick's Day.  It pisses me off SO BAD when ppl get all hardcore on Saint Patrick's Day.  Like for real, it makes me so mad for multiple reasons.  I don't mind when ppl wear green sweaters and stuff like that, but when they get all decked out in hardcore Irish garb and wear their friggin shamrock ice...wow i wanna rock everyone!  lol.  

<font size=5><b><u>REASONS WHY ST. PATS DAY FREAKS PISS ME OFF</b></u><font size=2>

1. For real, ok for one thing, St. Patrick's Day is not just Irish-based, like the whole Catholic Religion celebrates it, and not ALL Catholics are Irish.  

2. The whole story behind St. Pat is religious, its not just about Irish Ethnocentrists

3. Green is a color that does not look good on many people.

4. Its cool to wear like a green shirt or green pants or something, but ppl that get all decked out like a friggin irish nationalist Christmas Tree make me real sick.

5. You shouldn't have to wear green to demonstrate that you're Irish.  If you're REALLY Irish than you shouldn't have to get all green decked out, it should just show.  ""You should GLOW IRISH"" haha isabel!  Otherwise, you just look like a poser.

6. I'm half-Irish, but you know nobody'd believe me if I told them that anyway haha

7. There's way too many Irish people in Eden.  We need to rid ourselves of some of them.  Haha I think I already have a few choice ones in mind, cept theyre not REAL irish anyways hahaha jk

8. Green, shiny, plastic shamrocks strung up on a piece of yarn NEVER look good on ANYONE.  EVER.  Nor do huge, sequin-covered leprachaun hats.

9. The only person from Eden I would EVER want to see in a full-out leprachaun suit would be Don (for obvious reasons).

Widespreadeppo: another thing people that r irish go out and get shit-faced and i think saint patrick being a catolic and being a saint would want the irish to do somthing else rather that drinking or buying leorchonds 

ha.



~i hope no one takes offense to my previous statements (altho obv no one reads this anyways).  im not discriminating against irish ppl (obviously, i AM irish) and im not making fun of anyone in particular.  im just saying that those general things tend to piss me off.  ha."

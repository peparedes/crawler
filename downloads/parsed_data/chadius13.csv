"event","I'd like to personally thank anyone who helped out or came to see ""On Golden Pond.""  You're commitment and interest is what keeps theatre alive.  Struggling in Rochelle but alive.  With that said, I'd like to talk of upcoming events.  First of all, I'd like anyone who is interested in helping me start a brand new theatre company to drop me a line.  I'd like to have a meeting in August to discuss how we begin and where we go.  That said...new business.

Jesus Christ Superstar will happen.  we got off to a slow start I know.  I didn't expect to be directing this Summer.  Now that I'm don though, we can start filming.  I need people.  Let me know if you are at all interested in being in the film.  I WILL USE YOU!  Plus, I'm not hard to get ahold of...anymore.

Also, I've begun writing the script for the children's show this fall.  It is called ""Cabin Tales: A Tribute to American Ghost Stories"".  It revolves around a Father, Mother, and Son who live in a cabin, and on a dark stormy night they gather around to tell ghost stories.  The stories are then portrayed by other actors while the narration continues from whomever is telling the story.  I'm really trying to balance fear and humor since it IS a kid's show, so it will be a while before it's finished, but I'd like to audition in September sometime.  Anyways, I'm off to bed.  Just a heads up on what's going to happen soon.  Peace and God Bless."

"event","It's time for another show, you poop!  I encourage all who can to come and see ""On Golden Pond"" this weekend.  I know it's a VCCT show, and they have a reputation of being rather...well...they suck much ass.  I promise you, however, this one is different.  And here are some reasons why...

1. It stars Ms. Carol Weidmann as Ethel Thayer.  Not only was she an amazing teacher and director, she is also an outstanding actress...and accordion player.  I think we owe it to her to see her perform after she watched us for so long.

2. I've recently been informed that the past few shows have been directed by people who don't give notes, tell their actors what to do, and have no knowledge of the theatre.  My leading man has been in several VCCT shows, and I'm the first person to tell him that looking at the audience is not a good thing.  I won't call myself a talented genius, but I know what I'm doing, and I know what I want.  Although my Norman wont listen to me most of the time, I'm rather proud of the way an ""older"" cast has taken direction from a teenage.  I actually had my Chelsea tell me the other day that she didn't like getting notes from other people because she felt the cast was in touch with my ""vision"" and only I can know what that is.  I wouldn't call it a vision, but I want to be entertained just like everyone else, so I make things as entertaining as I can.  

3. The bit roles are amazing.  Charlie the mailman is one of the funniest characters I've ever worked with.  Todd Parker, from Byron, has given this Northern Hick some of the most vibrant expressions and movements I've ever seen.  I crack up at him every night.  Bill, played by Terry Camplain, is one other character who is worth a laugh.  Although he appears for only half a scene, his awkwardness and fear of bears is worth several chuckles.  Lastly...my little brother says ""For Sheezy.""

4. Chelsea, the Thayers' daughter is on the outs with her father.  I've just been told, by the girl who plays my Chelsea, that she has been on the outs with her father in real life.  She hasn't spoken with him in 10 years.  She has now come in contact with her emotions, and she bawls on the stage every night.  One of the first times I've cried during a play, and I've seen her scene 40 times.  

5. The set is wonderful.  Although I was supposedly given a $1200 budget, I only spent around $500, although according to Rachel Pullin that is an insane amount of money for a play.  I guess she builds her sets from paper and perform on street corners.  I kept my cost down by using old wood, broken screws, and borrowing tons of stuff.  From the furniture to the deer head, almost 70% of the set is borrowed from someone who has a love for the theatre...or just this show.

6. The show is a classic.  Ms. Weidmann said is best when she said ""It's just good literature.""  I agree.  Golden Pond is, in a roundabout way, the story of everyone's life.  The theme of love, life, and memories touches us all in some way, and I think Golden Pond sets forth a good message about the preciousness of all of these.  

That being said, I've got work to do.  I hope to see everyone there one night.  Peace and God Bless."

"event","I'm not even sure what this post will entail...I'm just pissed and confused right now, and so I vent to the world.  Lately there have been certain people...I shall refuse to use names...who for some reason seem to know exactly how and why everything works out as it does.  Maybe we should start farther back...

As many of you may know, I have a pretty hectic life.  Whereas most people come home from school to relax, I get a 40 hour a week job, direct a play, write a water show, and plan for a film.  Now, I'm not saying this for pity...I'll just come out and say it, I love being busy.  I despise boredom.  I know it makes certain people mad (you may be one of them) because I rarely have free time to hang out or ""chill"" with them.  This is the life I chose...in the words of Peter Parker ""it is my blessing...my curse.""  Anyways, back to the topic on hand.

I have a small group of friends which I was close to for a long time.  We've since become less-so, but one of us moved away, and I spent a year at college.  We have tried to stay close friends for the past months, but with my schedule I have not had the most time to sit around writing emails and talking on the phone...I just don't have a lot of leisure time.

Anyways, myself and one of these friends are going through trying times right now, but I don't think it's the kind of situation where I should be completely alienated.  I was told tonight that I'm selfish because I don't have enough time for their feelings.  This may be presumptuous, but if I told a busy person to make time for ME, wouldn't I be the selfish one?  I'm also supposed to know what these people are thinking.  I am supposed to know when to call people when they want to talk because they won't call.  And I'm the bad guy when someone walks out without saying goodbye even though they wanted to talk to me.

There is one person in this group of 3 that I still consider a very good friend, and I hope she's being honest.  I hope I'm seeing the real her...she's the only one who's making any sense nowadays.  The friend who moved away sent me an email today about how I don't care about anyone...all I care about is my (and I quote) ""Fucking Revolution.""  I'm not sure what that is, but it does sound bad-ass, so maybe I should start one.  I just don't have time to check my email more than once or twice a week.  Not my fault he can check it 3 times a day and has to wait for any answer.

I guess the moral to all of you is, try to find the good in everyone.  If you're having a problem with someone...work it out...give them a hug...tell them to take their time.  Chances are, if they are having trouble keeping in touch all the time, they're MUCH too busy to deal with your emotional problems.  Some of us are just busy.  If someone tells you they are busy, don't assume they are blowing you off.  Some of us are just busy, and I know I'm not the only one.  

Peace and God Bless"

"event","Ok...I have some sad news and some good news, but I promise they will both be made sense out of shortly.  

The Sad News-I'm not doing Hamlet this fall
The Good News-I'm directing it this summer...I hope

Here's what's going on.  I was talking to Ms. Weidmann, and she said that I'm crazy to do Hamlet because no one will come.  I disagree, but what she suggested made a lot of sense to me.  She suggested that I do a low budget, possibly self-written, family or children's show.  The more I turned the idea in my head, the more it started to roll into a nice flat piece of good idea dough.  Here is a basic outline of my reasoning.

I.  Intro
A.  Doing a children's show this fall is a good idea.
B.  Holding Hamlet till Summer is a good idea.

II.  Why do a children's show?
A.  By doing a children/family show I am almost guaranteeing a ""yes"" from any school I beg to use their gymnasium as a performance space.
B.  I can make the set out of cardboard and say I was going for a ""pop-up"" book feel.
C.  I can adapt folktales and stories without having to pay royalties.
D.  I can expect a big audience because the schools will know and children need parents to take them.

III.  Why hold Hamlet till Summer?
A.  I will have some spending cash to spend on the performance.
B.  I can possibly do Shakespeare in the park for a couple of performances.
C.  I can work with talented actors and actresses I know, who will be away at school in the fall.
D.  People will know a little about the company already.

So, there's my lay-out.  This means I am going to start a planning group to get this kid's show together.  This also means, anyone who will be back next Summer, I expect all of you will audition or help out in some way.

WE WILL BRING GOOD ART BACK TO ROCHELLE!"

"event","Ok...I've been pining over this for some time.  I know I want to start my theatre company up this fall, and I knew I wanted to do Shakespeare because I don't have to pay royalties.  The only question I had to answer was...""Which show do you want to try, Chad?""  I thought and thought...for 3 months now.  I knew I wanted to do a show that most people would know.  I need to make quite a bit of money off of this first show, and I can't do that if no one comes.  There is one thing I learned while dealing with community theatre...most people will only come to shows they have heard of.  In any other city I could do any Shakespeare show I wanted, but in this town with the low budget I have, I don't think I could sell tickets to Titus Andronicus or Henry IV.

My decision may forever break me, but we all have to take risks sometimes.  The show I've decided to try and conquer is...Hamlet.  This may be Willie's best piece of work, and it is arguably his best known next to Romeo and Juliet.  I was talking to Ms. Weidmann, and she said that a lot of times VCCT does crappy ass shows, but they pack the house.  No one knows why, but I think if we get the word out that Shakespeare will be done in Rochelle, we can attract crowds...especially if it turns out to be a good show.  I don't have much of a budget, so I'll have to update.  God knows period costumes would kill me.  I hope Grant can help me with a nice cheap set, and I'm hoping a local church may donate me a couple weeks of space to performs in...I need to ask around.  

I guess now is when I make my plea.  I need actors, set people, board members, lights, sound, KYLE-choreography...any help you think you can pitch in, I'll gladly take.  Hamlet does not have a huge cast luckily, but there are not many bit roles, so most of the actors will be onstage a lot.  Don't be worried if you've never done Shakespeare, that's what a week or two of learning is for. Feel free to reply to this if you want to help or email me at chads_school_lunchbox@hotmail.com .  I think we can have a lot of fun, learn a lot, and set a nice future down for anyone who chooses to continue in this company.  Thank you for all the support, God Bless."

"event","Oh man, what a great time to be a witch.  I do not mean that literally of course.  I know the difference between the witches from movies and books and real wiccans.  This month, however, seemed to love the witches.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban opened to anxious fans everywhere with a $93 million debut.  Also, WICKED, the new broadway musical which reveals the stories of Galinda and Elphaba (the Good Witch of the North and the Wicked Witch of the West), which went to the Tonys this year with 10 nominations and 3 wins including Best Leading Actress In A Musical (Idina Menzel-Wicked Witch), Best Scenic Design, and Best Costume Design.  What a week to be a witch...or wizard.

In other news, I have the hardest time getting ahold of people.  People always say they will be on line or at home...and then they aren't.  If you are someone who does this...stop...it's really annoying.

The VCCT show is coming along fine.  We're finally getting into the rehearsals I love...in depth character and scene analysis.  VCCT is still not giving me info or anything...they are very unorganized.  Also, they guy who plays Norman seems to think he can direct better than I can.  I'm not doubting anything, but he can't possibly know while he's on stage and can't see what I or the audience sees.  Luckily I have Ms. Weidmann there trying to help me...she just gives up sometimes, but I can tell by her face she's just as frustrated as I am.  It will still be a good show though.  I got some people who wanna help out with my theatre company.  Grant Sabin has agreed to help me with sets.  Cara, his sister wants to choreograph and says she might be able to get us a spot in Chicago to perform.  Michel Windland is going to school to write and produce plays, so hopefully she can debut some work on our stage.  If anyone is interested in helping out in any way...let me know.  I need support.

That is all...God Bless...peace."

"event","For all those out the that have not ventured out to see Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban, do it NOW!  There is a new director for this movie, and he is incredible.  Do not judge this movie based on your premonitions of the first two.  Azkaban is done so artistically it blew my mind.  Almost all the shots were...genius.  Not to give anything away, Boggart scene with the ""through the mirror"" shots...were just...perfect.

I know some of you may not be Harry Potter fans.  If you haven't, I suggest reading the books.  I thought the whole thing was stupid until I read the books.  Even if you are not a fan, see this movie.  See if you can spot the cameos.  Anyone recognize Aunt Marge from another movie?  Let me know if u figure it out.  I thought it was hilarious.  

Long story short...see Azkaban...good movie...On Golden Pond underway...swim at Spring Lake...peace and God Bless."

The cast is fine though.  Our read through was tonight and I laughed and cried at all the right places.  There IS some talent hidden in VCCT, and I was lucky enough to snag the amazing CAROL WEIDMANN for the role of Ethel. If anyone wants to help me out with set or tech stuff...LET ME KNOW.  I'll need all the help I can get.

I also went shopping for concession stand food.  THERE IS A TON.  The pool opens this weekend.  I hope everyone comes down to Spring Lake this summer.  It will be a blast and a half.

Write more later.  I'm going out tonight with some old friends.  God Bless."

"event","Well, everyone, I've finally done it.  I've returned home.  I am just about ready to start my busiest summer ever.  Tomorrow I have to audition for On Golden Pond.  I'm directing the show for VCCT this summer.  I had been worried about finding the right Ethel for a long time, but when I got home something amazing happened.  Ms. Carol Weidmann called to make sure it wouldn't be weird if she auditioned for my show.  She isn't sure if she can do it, but I was glad to hear it none the less.  

I will start work at Spring Lake Concession-o-rama Stand next week.  That should prove hot and repetitive.  Luckily I have something to take my mind off work that week...HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN.  I'm going to see it opening night at midnight at the IMAX theatre in Chicago, and I haven't been this excited since I almost lost my virginity...the first time.

Jesus Christ Superstar will begin filming next week as well after many screen tests to see if Kyle looks good with straight hair and scouting locations.  I seem pretty busy, so I'm going to head off to bed.  Just a heads up on coming attractions...for myself.  God Bless."

This summer I will be directing On Golden Pond for VCCT, working at the good ol pool and filming Jesus Christ Superstar, so I shall be pretty busy.  I'm still stuck at school alone for a few more days.  Shall be home on May 23rd.  I cannot wait to see you all again.  God Bless."

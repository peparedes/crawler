yesterday i attended a friend's wedding shower. it was awkward at first, but it was a good time. i've been good friends with her since grade 10 and although we don't see each other often i really consider her a good friend, she's just so easy to talk to. 

i'm sitting here at work, bored and listless. everyone is gone today but me. i have the lucky job of being the department today. 

tonight i will make dinner and watch tv. no wonder i don't have a fanbase. my life is ass."

"event","good afternoon.

i am actually keeping my goal of writing frequently which is nice. even if no one reads this i don't care its for my own personal reflection.

my email was busted earlier this week, i hope i did not miss any emails. i'm scared i lost the one i am putting so much thought and effort into.

yesterday i did meet up with gillian. i got to see her new beach pad. very nice! we got some food at this hip cafe and went to the beach! first time going to the beach this summer! very exciting. we ate on a log and chatted. the sun was shining perfectly but it was a tad windy. i saw a beautiful eagle flying over us. picture perfect british columbia i must say. i did not notice until now that sand got into my purse! ha! we then went back to her place to watch tv and chat. good evening, gillian is really starting to become a good friend. we have so much in common it's crazy. i'm glad she was my assistant and i got the chance to know her throughout the process of the show. 

as for tonight we are going for ukrianian dinner. then perhaps i'll return all the movies i rented, get some beer and relax.

i also seem to have lost connact with an old friend nicholas. i don't know how i'll get into connact with him anymore."

i've been really good lately seeing old friends. its been great, although sometimes i feel i'm growing apart from them. i talked to an old friend last night and they told me to email my prof regarding my grade. i did last night and still no response. i don't think i'll ever get one. i'm sad that he doesn't care, i'm sad that i care way too much. double edge sword. i'm suppose to meet up with my friend gillian tonight. she's great so much fun.

i have a movie to watch. finding neverland better watch it soon! well there's no food in the house so it looks like i'll be getting subway again.

"event","i get discouraged really easily. especially by people whom i admire, people who i want encouragement from and praise. i was already hurt by his actions earlier (read previous post). why should i be suprised this time?

i think its because i'm ugly or fat. that's what i tell myself, because i don't want to believe that i'm terrible at what i do. he just gives the pretty girls what they want. the ugly ones are less valueable to him. i want to not believe that because i've seen his wife. she looked nothing like i expected her to look like. 

i'm the worst of the best? in a class of 90s i get an 85. i know he didn't look at the others work. they laughed when they were told by him that they were going to receive A+ and he walked away. i knew he didn't look at my work i didn't want to settle for that, i paid for the class mark my work. i wanted him to see the work that i worked so hard on. it's worth 85% less than the others work he didn't look at.

i'm sad and discouraged. he emailed me telling me to attend something. i don't want to go, i don't want to email him back. i know if i go i'll be more discouraged. i don't want to break my will anymore.

my heart is broken and so is my trust."

"event","i'm quite upset this evening. i guess its because sometimes i feel left out and when it something happens to confirm my feeling it doesn't add to my confidence. tonight i feel like quitting school. i'm the stupid fat kid that doesn't belong again and everything confirms my feeling. the situation you ask? well i'll tell you.

back in september i was assigned to assist my advisor and my professor for a set design. i felt, hey i must be good he's assigning me himself, right? i was in the loop receiving emails etc. i was feeling like this was a real job, that it was important that i was there. there were 4 other assistants also, which from looking back on it i should of noticed that i was not significant in this whole bullshit i was there for free labour (literally). i go to meetings i spend time doing things etc.. feeling good about myself. he told me i was going to be paid, me and two other assistants, he told me i'd be paid. today in front of 2 other assistants he told them about 'their' cheques and to pick them up. i stood there almost waiting for something to be said because i believed it. nothing, i leave almost heart broken. almost like it was stupid for me to even be there. i dont want to anymore, i don't even want to try. i feel like saying fuck it and quiting school. 

i don't believe in this department anymore, my trust is broken."

"event","i feel stuck sometimes. i'm in a situation that probably could be blamed on my own actions but it is because they were interpreted wrong by someone. how to fix this sort of situation? do you ignore it in hopes it will fade, do you try and fix it even though there's no point anymore. i think i opt for the first option, you can only care so much especially when the person isn't worth your time. but how am i suppose to react when someone who knows me believes these things as well and doesn't response when hearing these things in the manner i expect every friend to react. do i ignore this? can i ignore this? 

i guess sometimes i'm too pushy, but i believe in the whole 'people can better themselves' maybe i should make myself better first. i'm just some stupid fat ugly kid. 

i think it's easier to hate people then to love people. when you hate someone you expect the worse in every situation that way you won't get punched in the face when the shit hits the fan. 

i can't believe he didn't react. i can believe he thinks this is how i am. he always thought i was selfish. i feel used. i feel unknown and lost. i'm hurt.

i don't think he can make it better because the time is gone and he didn't react."

"event","well those who know me are aware of my love for green day. i've adored the band since my younger teen days and have continued being a fan during there progress into a wonderful band. i adore the new album, i don't think i can stress this enought. anyways.

well today was unlike any other day? why you might ask? well i am updating and i rarely due. my life has been filled with shit at school because of the show i designed, but i don't want to bore with the gory details of why you shouldn't attend ubc for a theatre program.

today at noon (12:15 ryan was late). we left for lynwood washington. green day was doing a signing at 5pm. it took about 2.5 hours to get there. we get into line and they run out of wristbands so we are not promised to meet them. well fuck, a hole day wasted. we wait in line for 2 hours which seem like forever and we get in. its surreal being so close to people that you admire. i almost lost my shit standing there, i had to contain myself and keep composure so i could say what i wanted to say. it was a quick meet and greet no pictures with the band, no personalized signatures (which was ok i already had there autographs). i get close and figure hell, here goes nothing. i look billie in the eye and say hi, i want to thankyou for your music, it means a lot to me and helped me get through some tough times. he seemed humbled by the comment probably better them some of the shit he heard from those 13 yearold twats. anyways, tre joked with me and mike spoke to me about the album art and told me about the new video. i said thankyou to mike and left.


so yeah.

we are moving again. i hate where we live, and i dont like having a roomate. i guess it bugs me to live with someone else. maybe its not the person entirely its just living with ryan is enough to make me mad why do i need someone else to take care of/clean up after. the new apartment is beautiful and modern, its near my sister's and its THE BEST THING EVER.
i found it online and OMG YAY!

actually i leave 30 minutes early cause no one notices. ha !!

well, i miss my highschool days i really do. i miss my friends especially gina and joey. we did some crazy things and i miss that. when did i grow up? how the hell did i get into UBC? i'll graduate one day, some day that day when day.

sometimes i totally feel great about my life. other days its like whoa what i am i doing with my life. i'm already 21 thinking about life goals? what the hell shouldn't i be stupid and partying 24/7? when did i get responsible? or am i even responsible? im completely different then i was in 2000 and it bugs the hell out of me. but then again i still do stupid things and spend large amounts of money on things i do not really need. for example i dropped 450 dollars on an ipod... do i need an ipod NO? do i want an ipod? i GUESS SO! it should be here monday, i am excited mainly because i like getting mail and waiting for it to come... that's all really. ryan will probably play with it more then i do. 

we are moving again? what the fuck? well it seems this place is dumb expensive and far away. beside we dont want to live with tyler anymore before we start hating each other more then we already do. its lame really, you never know people until you live with them. lame i know.

my sister is in toronto visiting my parents. some days i really miss them.. a lot. i miss my mom i miss spending time with her. its lame i feel alone here, its nice to have my sister here... but it feels like i have no reason to stay in vancouver sometimes even though i love it here. when i finish school i may move.. stupid UBC stuck there for 2 more years.. lame!

tomorrow is the portfolio review for my program. well i bet i suck, but atleast i can compare my work to other students. i really do not have much to show so it's going to be a pitiful display. 

i go to toronto soon, and yeah... school is going to be done on the 21st after my last exam. i bet i did shit ass this semester but whatever. i am a B average for this entire year and so far that's what i got.

i work tomorrow, should be a slow day or atleast i hope. i really hate the stupid people that call in. seriously if you are calling a government department please know what you are looking for, it's all i ask. i hate it when i have to explain things to people, i feel like 411 sometimes giving out correct numbers. who am i? the fucking telephone operator, why call us? WHY? can you tell i'm angry??????? and then when i ask people simple questions about their job/industry they are like ""i dunno"" well how the fuck should i know? i'm only asking to see if you've called the right place now FUCK OFF.

don't call the labour department, seriously we don't cover you unless you are a federal department or federal regulated and mcdonalds isn't.

<b>year in review:</b>
last semester at douglas college - great time, a lot of fun memories. Making a music video, stupid jokes, and being so tired but having so much fun.
graduating - i actually managed to graduate, proud momment for my parents and for me.
getting accepted to UBC - didn't think i would, big shock.
working back with the government - kind of a copp out job but good money and i didn't do much work.
getting homer - one of the best things that has ever happend to me.
starting school at UBC - scary, i still don't feel like i belong.
my birthday - i didn't do anything, go figure. i went for a lovely japanese dinner with my family. 
my father getting transfered to toronto - well that's some news you don't want to hear.
christmas 2003 - it was ok, i love spending time with my mom. 
new years - watched tv with ryan and homer, my two boys.

i didn't do much this year it seems. i guess i'm a boring person. 2004... starting off with my parents moving. i guess being more independant will make me become more interesting. we also want to move this year.

<b> goals for 2004 </b>
get decent grades
keep decent job
move to north burnaby - to a two bedroom aparment that allows dogs
get another dog 
visit parents - a lot
pierce nose - still deciding this
keep stuff cleaner - i need ryan's help with this
eat healthier
think positive
try and contact and see old friends
don't let being afraid stop me from doing stuff
grow up"

school is almost finished, two exams left french and drama. i'm not too worried about drama and french freaks me out, but hey if i was so freaked out i'd be studying right now. i wrote an exam wednesday afternoon, i studied my butt off and it seemed i didn't need to once i wrote the exam, sure i knew dates and important people but the other stuff was relevant to the rest of the exam. when i was done i turned to nicole and said i wasted 24 hours of my life reading over 10 plays for an exam which didn't even mention one. ugh.. hours of my life i'll never get back. i don't know what my mark will be like in this class, the teacher is a hard marker.. can i have a B please?

today was nice, saw some friends watched tv. ate drank and was merry. my friend is in town, she came back from working on cruiseships. it's weird i feel weird around her i don't know how to explain it really. it just doesn't seem like i have anything to contribute to the converstation when we talk because when we used to talk we had everything in common, and now we don't? she's here till jan. 5th hopefully i'll see her again and things will be ok. 

christmas is lurking, and my bank account is crying. my parents might be moving to toronto, honestly i don't know what to make of us this right now. i'm so busy with everything i feel like when the realization does hit me i'll have a nervous breakdown.. figures. i used to wish i was busy cause i was so bored out of my mind, now i yearn for a day i can fuck off... school is so demanding and i feel like i'm just one of a million trying to do the same thing. sucky..

hopefully i can get some good studying in tomorrow for french class. i figure i'll study at school for a few hours then study on saturday before the test. yes, that's right the exam is 7pm on saturday, LAME!! i have to work 3 full days at work next week, it's gonna kill me because i haven't done it since the summer. i cant imagine being there that long 4 hours seem too long. i need the money."

Homer is a purebreed Beagle. He's happy, hyper and sleepy. His bark is so cute and he keeps me very VERY busy. My entire life consists of Homer right now. I love my puppie.

I hope ya'll are doing fine. Although I never comment I always read your journals.

i went to UBC on saturday to write a test for english placement, i dunno how i did. i am afraid. 

work is alright, im pretty bored. i do my work too fast and waste most of my day. come tomorrow all the back log will be done and i'll have nothing to do. sucks.. i think i may tell my boss i need more projects, she's not gonna be around this week. sucks to be me.

i don't expect to ever get anything, or deserve anything. i assume the worst because it hurts less when the shit hits the fan. i've been rejected so many times and i've been a loser for awhile now, so why would i expect good things to happen to me? 

i did shitty in highschool had no direction at all, took a year off and was a bum, i pretty much hated myself. then i went to douglas and took this silly stagecraft program i never thought i'd be good at. i did pretty good, i was ok. i got a good summer job, but the comfy program at douglas ended and i was stuck being a loser again. i've only been out of school for a month mind you but it's exactly how i felt. i got my job back i was happy but sadden i had no idea what was going on come september.

on may 5th i had an interview with the head of the theatre design program at UBC and it went well, he told me i'd be good enough to get it. but i still hadnt recieved my letter of acceptance to UBC so i assumed i sucked and they didn't want me. 

i applied late sent stuff late, and i never get my shit together on time.

i got the letter today, i'm in.

now ask myself what's next?"

today i went to school and saw my friends. we gossiped (of course) and talked about the party on saturday. i've decided i most likely will not be going, i'm pooped! 

tonight me and ryan played trival pursuit at dave's house, somehow i managed to be tied with first place then we split into teams so we'd finish faster. so this worked to my advantage even more. the final question had to do with my family's canadian native history who woulda thunk! ryan got it.

tomorrow i think im going to that lame auto show with ryan and dave. im going to sit in every damn car i can so i will feel special. i also have to type up some of my research stuff for my art project. boo hiss!"

I've been partying too much lately too many late nights drinking with school mates and the teacher(!) let's say there's now a huge flashing red X on him. he dry humped my friend (don't ask)
i finally dyed my hair dark purple, i like it a lot. painting this semester was good i hope i get like straight A's this semester to bump up my gpa higher *crosses fingers*
i saw judy's baby finally, she's so cute and tiny and wonderful.
my thoart hurts a lot right now and i should be sleeping.
i have a huge assignment due next friday (one week tomorrow eeekk!)
my father is in LA
i am in vancouver with ryan whom i NEVER spend time with any more.
there's a party on saturday but i don't think i need to drink 3 weekends in a row. correct?
i want/need to cut my hair.
i NEED to get my summer job in line SOON ASAP!!
i need to purchase new shoes because my runners are covered in paint from painting the show.
the funniest thing ever happend greg dumped paint on himself. oh man!
i really need to update more so many things happen that i WANT to remember later in my life but im so damn lazy it seems.

i have to paint for the show tomorrow. it'd be good if i actually knew which colours to paint stuff, but the designer is always absent. i figure he'll be absent tomorrow, although i have phoned him and left a message. so tomorrow i'll be blindly painting stuff hoping it looks ""ok"". 

i need to stick to my diet better 16 pounds is all i've lost. i NEED to lose more. i am unhappy but i will never be content. i love buying clothing lately and my bank account shows it. i got neat shoes and jean capris. very hip i'm told. i need a haircut and some hairdye and something to be pierced. like my nose or lip, but i'm too chicken and ""afraid"" of job prospects with piercings.

I SUCK.

tonight was strange, but in a good way. i saw two old highschool friends. jasmine and robin we hung out went for dinner went for coffee and chatted. everythings changed, it's almost insane. they both are doing good and look real good too. im amazed how much gossip i got tonight, it seems everyone has gotten no where or they are pregnant. like half of the girls had babies! people are married.. and then there's me.

ryan went out to his friend's to watch the hockey game and i decided not to follow along. so i'm watching tv and playing with my makeup. school starts on monday and i dunno about this semester. i have mixed feelings but i normally do. i'm thinking about dying my hair another darker colour. blueish purple? black? i got no idea. 

so many decisions i have no make within the year 2003. 2002 was good for me suprisingly. and i hope 2003 will be. 

highlights of 2002 (in no particular order):

- for the majority school was good and i got good marks
- got a good summer job which paid a lot for me to do nothing
- made money!
- met new friends 
- saw paul mccartney
- went to the boston museum of art
- me and ryan are still together.. 3 years and um.. 5 months 
- i'm happy?

i don't have much else to say. ryan will be back probably around 10. and i'm just gonna sit around and watch tv and surf the net. i should do a million other things but i would rather not."

yesterday my final construction project was done. it was hellish to get there. the class went to boston pizza after for drinks and such. i don't like anyone but a few so it was lame and i didn't really wanna go in the first place cause i am rather anti-social. i can always keep my humour about me but lately i see myself losing grip. hating people i love and just not being there out of spite. 

i just need a month off. i think all my feeling will disappear. i go to maine soon and i have mix feelings about it. not sure whether to like it or not because i like my family and my home for christmas. someone be me instead."

ryan starting buying some of my christmas gifts online today i got a few things but sephora.com doesnt use canadian credit cards! i'm crushed i wanted so many things from there! now i guess i'll go downtown to the bay and sears to get some neat makeup there and stuff. i also want the almost famous dvd.

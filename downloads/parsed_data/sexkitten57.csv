I kinda wish i was more adventurous....i was fine in my seat (section 215, row c) but the guy who invited me somehow schmoozed his way down onto the floor....i didnt follow, then Kenny literally popped up right in front of him...SO JEALOUS! Oh well it was still awesome. I wish he would have played some of his older songs like ""me and you"" though he did encore with ""she thinks my tractor's sexy"" which was awesome! it was all awesome awesome awesome!

"event","i keep waking up in strange positions after having really crazy dreams. sometimes my legs are under me sometimes im twisted up like a pretzel and well it just seems to be getting worse. Yesterday my phone alarm went off at 5am (as it does) to wake me up, i appeared to have been sleeping quite normally in the fetal position which is very comfy...however when i tried to stand up it was obvious that something wasnt right...

Still sitting on my bed i put my feet on the ground, when i went to stand up my knees completely buckled underneath me. I fell to the ground. I tried again this time from the floor so i was standing on my knees (where i felt fine) and i went on to one knee with the idea that i would use my hands to help get me to a standing position...it didnt work, i fell again. I eventually decided, after numerous attempts to stand, that i needed to sleep it off, maybe it would go away. My legs were not asleep they werent even numb. I could pinch my foot and feel lit i just could not stand it was like i was paralized from the knee down on both legs...i dont know what happened. I napped for abotut a half hour and when i woke up it seemed to have gotten a bit better. I could stand again but it still scares me that for a morning i was unable to walk....i hope that never happens again. 

Has anyone else had this happen before???"

"event","I was blown away. 
What could I say? 
It all seemed to make sense. 
You've taken away everything, 
And I can't deal with that. 
I try to see the good in life, 
But good things in life are hard to find. 
We'll blow it away, blow it away. 
Can we make this something good? 
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around. 

Let's start over. 
I'll try to do it right this time around. 
It's not over. 
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground. 
This love is killing me, 
But you're the only one. 
It's not over. 

Taken all I could take, 
And I cannot wait. 
We're wasting too much time 
Being strong, holding on. 
Can't let it bring us down. 
My life with you means everything, 
So I won't give up that easily. 
I'll blow it away, blow it away. 
Can we make this something good? 
'Cause it's all misunderstood. 
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around. 

Let's start over.

'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground.

But you're the only one. 
It's not over. 

We can't let this get away. 
Let it out, let it out. 
Don't get caught up in yourself. 
Let it out. 

Let's start over. 
I'll try to do it right this time around.

Let's start over. 
It's not over, yeah... 
This love is killing me, 
But you're the only one. 
It's not over."

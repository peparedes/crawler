"" i cant shree scrate"" haha im gonna swim with the goddamn fishies. bahaha.. yea it was fun but wat i failed to mention was the night b4 which was much funner. ive been having too much fun lately and i think im getting wore out i feel dead dude seriously i never shut an eye last night and went to work at 8:43 this mornign. BULLSHIT! i wasnt allowed to clock in because i have overtime yet i stayed bc dumb jew neil is had 3 ppl working fo rhim. i knew chris wouldnt be there thanks buddy i didnt think yaitza or rion would show up but eventually they did. the one night i pick to pull an all nighter is the night b4 the worst busiest day in taco bell history everyone thought to themselves lets kill jen a little bit more by eating the shit from tb. line out the door non stop cars making upstairs and downstairs.. with the maintenance kid, need i say more nah i didnt think so i think i cried a little. anywayz neil said it was the worst day of his life too so im not bullshittin. it was horrible. i  left at 2 and here i am i feel like i was ran over by a car and i think my eyes may be a little swollen, atleast they feel that way. ne wayz im going to sleep for as long as possible so no one tell me about ne thing fun i am not inviting my phone is being turned off.

"event","last nite i got in yet another car accident with my friends we crashed into a pole in front of the ford dealership it wasnt a big deal or ne thing cuz none of us were hurt at all but her car is fucked up on the side and the fact that this just happend to me like last week makes me sick.ne wayz this is wat happend. the nite started off calm we bought a bottle of tequila blah blah we were gonna drink it but i didnt start drinkin with everyone else because i really wanted to win this card game. Then stacey showed up and we started taking shots together and we played spades and all the sudden we wanted to go find the pool in saddlebrook so were like its down the road we'll be fine. we never found it but we tried to steel like 6 golf carts. then instead of going back to apes we went to lynz house bc her boyfriend went to clearwater with a bunch of girls. so we stole this fire extinguisher from the apartments and sprayed his new truck that was sitting at there house the thing was completely white. but he deserved it . then we were driving i thought stacey was pretty sober by now but she wasnt we were on our way back tp apes and i put on country music and staceys like ""Lets go to texas!"" and she made this huge fuckin u-turn which looked so fucked up to the cops because it looked like she was crossing the road heading for the pole. But ne way the cops didnt give out  sobriety tests or ne thing no ticket but staceys car was towed away. so it sucked and i woke up this mornign with the first hang over ive had in a year i puked everytime ne thing went into my body i couldnt even drink water."

Well, what kind of owl would you have been if you'd just <i>let</i> him burn like that? You'd have been no better than the Cold Hunter. You did what you thought was right."

"event","<lj-cut text=""The owlets have arrived!"">Tal and I now have the most beautiful owlets in the history of owl kind. They hatched last night.

We have three little boy-owls named Aed, Fiachra, and Conn, and the prettiest little girl-owl named Fionuala. (I picked out the names. Tal would have called them Tal 1, Tal 2, Tal 3, and Girl-Tal. But even that can't upset me, because the owlets are so <i>perfect</i>...)

It was worth the puffy talons and everything. *nuzzles Tal and each of the owlets in turn* I'm so happy... <i>We're</i> so happy.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""conversation with Tal""><b>me:</b> Our owlets might be very fluffy.
<b>Tal:</b> I know. Am I that fluffy?
<b>me:</b> Yes. Hmm...I think he's got my eyes...
<b>Tal:</b> He's a very good-looking owlet. *bobs head* we should get him more shiney bits
<b>me:</b> My person got more shiney things for his hatching-day. You should bring them to the nest.
<b>Tal:</b> *lots of head bobbing* Yes! He got a very stripey one. It would be nice.
<b>me:</b> Mmm...maybe not the stripey one, that would clash with the red glittery thing. What about the gold one?
<b>Tal:</b> Okay. Then it would look like everything else in this owlery. Uh... Humanery? 
<b>me:</b> ::rolls eyes:: Humanery. Honestly, Tal, where do you come up with these things? First trying to talk to that poor deaf-mute, now calling their dormafory a ""humanery""...
<b>Tal:</b> *looks down at talons* ...well, I just thought... we're owls... we live in an owlery...
<b>me:</b> Awwww, Tal... ::nuzzles him softly with her beak:: I'm sorry, I know I've been snappy lately...
<b>Tal:</b> *nuzzles back, hoots softly* it's okay... 

Then, later:
<b>me:</b> Are you making fun of that deaf-mute again?
<b>Tal:</b> O.O *shakes head* no.
<b>me:</b> I know he's an easy target, but honestly... You need to be his friend and make sure no one else picks on him either. ::hears herself:: O.O ...I sound like someone's mother... >.<
<b>Tal:</b> But you are somebody's mother. or you will be... And I tried to be his friend but he wouldn't even look at me. *owl scowl*
<b>me:</b> Maybe you just didn't get his attention. Take him an owl treat and see if he wants to share. ...>.<! I DO sound like someone's mother! 
<b>Tal:</b> I pecked him on the beak. He didn't move or anything. and I just told you! You're going to be a mother. Of course you'll sound like one. *bobs head*
<b>me:</b> You pecked him on the beak? That's not very friendly! I'm surprised he didn't attack you. The Cold Hunter looks like he could be mean in a fight. Or maybe he thought you were trying to kiss him. ::ponders::
<b>Tal:</b> O.O I WAS NOT! *fluffs feathers up*
<b>me:</b> I didn't say you were, I said maybe he THOUGHT you were. ::owl-giggle::
<b>Tal:</b> well, I wasn't. *owl-pout*
<b>me:</b> ::owl-snuggle:: Don't get all defensive, it was just an idea. Lately you're as oversensitive as I am... ::nuzzles with her beak again::

And then, we were discussing names. After refusing to allow him to call all of our owlets ""Tal 2,"" ""Little Tal,"" ""Tal 3,"" etc., he came up with the surprisingly brilliant idea of naming them after the children of Lir. I figure, swans, owls, it's not that much of a stretch! So we might have Little Tal, Fionuala, Aed, Fiachra, and Conn. I like it.</lj-cut>

Not much longer now til the nest is full of our beautiful little owlets..."

"event","Tal is not the brightest feather in the nest, now is he? He insists on talking to ""the cold hunter."" I tried to tell him that it's not a normal Falcon, but would he listen to me? Nooooo.

The Cold Hunter is obviously a deaf-mute. Tal's so insensitive, prattling on to him like that. Honestly, <i>males</i>. Doesn't matter what species they are, they're simply moronic. Except for that Adie McCormack, of course..."

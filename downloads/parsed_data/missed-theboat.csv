"event","So, Hollins hosted a VP debate showing and we had about 40+ students show up to watch the candidates answer/evade the questions posed at them by the fabulous Gwen Ifill. 

This debate did nothing but solidify my vote towards the Obama/Biden ticket. 

Palin not only successfully evaded most of the questions in the first half of the debate, but she assumed her entire audience was more than happy to hear about ""middle class values"" and ""freedoms"" on which she never elaborated. The very ""freedoms"" she wants to uphold apparently do not include gay/lesbian or women's rights, but nevertheless, she consistently went right back to Alaska and how much she had done to reform energy, taxes, etc. Forgive me, but Alaska does not represent America as a whole, nor does her (in)experience as governor there indicate her ability to serve as VP. 

Palin thinks that a $43,000 income is lower-middle class income. HELLO! The poverty level in the United States is $27K for women and $37K for men (annually). If you are making $43,000, especially as a woman, you are doing pretty well for yourself, by making almost double the poverty level. If you consider yourself a ""middle-class"" all around American, you have GOT to realize that most Americans do not have her (or any of the candidate's) privilege. Saying she has five children (one being ""special needs"") and being a working mother is respectable, but how much help does she honestly have in raising those children. Imagine a woman in her position, with five children, one of whom has special needs, but is making little over $27,000 a year. Not only does that mother probably not have ANY health insurance for herself and her children, but she may or may not have a partner with whom to raise the children. Palin, who does not support women's choice to their reproductive options, fails to realize that that mother, who makes just over the poverty line (or below it), couldn't (under the McCain presidential ballot) get an abortion to prevent having another child she couldn't feed.  NOT only that, but she wouldn't even be able to get alternative forms of birth control to protect herself from pregnancy in the first place. Hell, there's so much that mother couldn't do if McCain comes into office. 

It's terrific that Palin is a mother and a wife and a political figure, blah blah blah. Yes, I'm excited that women are making it to important offices in the United States. Of course. But I will not be blinded by gender in order to make a decision that will ultimately affect our future. Just because Palin is making history by being the only woman to participate in a vice presidential debate since the 1980s (correct me if I'm wrong) doesn't mean she is representing all women or that she is in fact, a feminist. Far from it, really. If a feminist defines someone who wants equal rights between and among the sexes, then by god, I haven't seen feminist behavior out of Palin. 

One particular moment in the debate occurred when Palin brought up being a mother and having a special needs child and playing to the fact that she's had a hard time, etc. Biden, in a moment during which he was visibly emotional, admitted he, too, knew how it was to be a single parent, that just because he is a man does not mean he has not felt the same type of emotional stress, etc. His own wife and child died and he has a son in the National Guard, which places him, in the view of some of the American public, as a sympathetic figure. Whether or not his emotional response was genuine or exaggerated for the purposes of the debate, he made an important point about the underlying sexism that Palin herself imposed when she proposed being a mother, etc. affects her campaign. It's ironic that we have heard so much that being a mother, etc. hinders a woman's ability to serve public office (complete bullshit) and NOW we are hearing the same criteria serves to induce empathy from the public as a reason why Palin is just ""one of us"". 
Biden said something along the lines of ""Just because I'm a man, doesn't mean I don't know how it feels to be a single parent.""  Playing gender was an important rhetorical device (to me) because he admitted that Palin is playing her gender as being important (however unintentionally). She referred to it numerous times, which I think is a cop-out. 

The McCain thinks that by choosing Palin, he will appeal to the ""middle class"" or the ""common people"". That's such a sly ploy. Choose the young, inexperienced woman to appeal to not only women (who he assumes are too stupid to realize she is ultimately against equal rights) but to those who feel like McCain is far from being of the common people. I don't buy it. 

On the question of same sex benefits, Biden expressed very solid responses that he supports same-sex benefits, etc. but he does not support same sex ""marriage"". The terminology does not bother me as much as it used to, considering our country is simply not yet as progressive as Europe or elsewhere. I was a little irked that, as progressive as he and his campaign is, they still don't use the ""m"" word in response to same sex partnerships. Palin said she agrees with the same-sex benefits of Biden, but I am not convinced. I know she disagrees with the marriage aspect, and Ifill concluded that the VP candidates agreed on the topic. I am not convinced they are, and I am certainly not convinced she agrees with all the benefits Biden does in regards to same sex partnerships. I simply must do more research on each campaign's work with same-sex rights/benefits. I certainly know the Obama campaign has done more vocal promotion in the GLBTQ community, as represented by the ""Obama Pride"".

Much of the panel on CNN is saying how Biden controlled himself for the most part in the debate, not causing too much drama, even though he had the capacity to do so. He obviously has much more experience than Palin, or Obama for that matter. He could have smoked the debate, but in doing so, risked looking like a bully. Personally, I don't think he should have held back as much. Of course, there is a line between being an asshole and just being a powerful politician, but Palin's lack of knowledge about politics should be highlighted. Her inexperience is important, but more important is her overwhelming inability to answer a question directly. Why pacify those urges to call Palin out on her evasive responses? I realize the tactic behind Biden's calm demeanor, but the one time he actually called Palin, I suddenly felt a little more respect for the senator. Of course, I am biased... understandably. 

Palin didn't bomb as badly as I'd imagined, but she successfully eluded most of the questions in the beginning and demonstrated her inability to stay on topic. 

In American politics, unfortunately, we have such a divided party line that often, it comes down to bad or worse concerning presidential elections. 

My vote hasn't changed. And I doubt it will at this point, with a month left before the election."

"event","So last night was one of the worst nights... it involves a friend of mine and some private issues. But I probably had a panic attack over her. Now, I just want to relax and relax and relax for the weekend.

Everyone (and her sister) is going to The Park tonight for Rainbow Night, which is supposed to kick off Gay Pride Week or coming out week or something along those lines. All of NEFA is going, plus all of my sweet ass friends (including Katy, Shannon, Cori, Shelby, Amanda, etc. [former Randy 2'ers]). 

Last night, Shelby Knox came to Hollins and spoke, then afterwards, she came to NEFA and they had a soiree for her with candles and wine and chatting. Unfortunately, because of my circumstances last night, I completely missed out on the lovely evening. I am so mad because I wanted to chat with Shelby and have that opportunity to chill with her. But alas, I was hyperventilating instead.

Today, I have to do a few errands before heading to The Park later tonight. I might read some for class, since I normally procrastinate so badly that my sleep is ruined for the week. I haven't gotten much sleep this week, and I hope to remedy that next week by going to bed at least by 12 or 1 instead of 4 am. 

Classes are going well. 
The Beat Generation is, as always, interesting and fun. 
Anthropology with LeeRay Costa is just plain amazing. I am even considering a minor in Anthro.
French is fun and simple enough, since I learn language well. 
Globalization and Poverty is depressing and heavy with reading, but it's informative and discussion-based, so right up my alley.

Well, I think I might head into the shower so that I can grab lunch and begin my day of relaxation and self-rejuvenation."

uplifting haiku?

Is it really love?
Just a summer flirtation? 
Warm hugs and kisses."

"event","Does anyone my age really know what he or she wants to do with his/her life? I mean, we all may have ideas of where we want to be in 15 years, but who really knows if we'll have the same aspirations 10 minutes from now, let alone years from now. I don't know if I want children, marriage, a stable home, or if I want to be traveling the world, hooking up with exotic people and flying to the corners of the earth. 

Maybe I want all of those... and more. 

I have recently flirted with the idea of becoming a pilot. I mean, the money wouldn't be bad. I would LOVE to fly a plane. Or at least I think I would. I might go up to the airport and take a ride around with an instructor to see about starting flying lessons. The sad thing is, they are $100 an hour. And to get certified as a pilot, you must have 40 hours. That's $4,000 of money I don't have at the present moment. And my authentic college education is costing is a pretty penny... enough that I can't just ask Mom and Dad to fork out 4K more for an impromptu dream. 

Honestly, if I want to fly, I will make it happen. Something in me always sticks with my dreams. And if it's meant to be, it will happen. If not, then I will let it go as another phase in my life of trying to figure myself out.

I wonder about friends who are going into specific careers and how set they are on what they want. Are they doing it for the money? For the prestige of a career in that field? Or just because they genuinely love that profession and want to continue it indefinitely? Maybe it's just safe. It's something to be told to have stability and security. But, for me, I'd rather fly by the seat of my pants and let each day take me to new dreams and new possibilities."

"event","I am working at kroger as a cashier. I really love it so far. Honestly, I thought I had lost my mind to apply there, but once I started working the register, I began to feel great about it. I love seeing people come and go through there. I love when we get busy because time FLIES by. I have been working 8 hour shifts and it's honestly not bad at all! I will have 36 hours this week. That's great! I worked from 1:30-10 today. I'm off Tomorrow. And then I go back Friday from 12:30-9. Michael is having a party on Saturday. I really hope I don't work early Sunday or I will honestly be dead on my feet. 

After work today, I went to meet up with Michael, Jeremy, Jordan, Jennifer, Lindsay, and Sam. We hung around at the Green Space and then went to the college yard. We basically just talked and ended up freaking each other out about scary things. Then, we all parted ways. Lindsay has to work at 7 this morning and Michael has to work, too, although not that early.

I am very pleased that I am not wasting my time dawdling around the house anymore. Instead, I am getting paid! I mean, yeah being on your feet all day and stuff is kind of whatever, but I have never had a real job before and I kind of like knowing that I am on a schedule and part of a company. And Kroger is a really good place to work. We have a Union and there is a lot of stuff going on at my Kroger. We are remodeling so there is going to be a lot more, even a sushi bar!  Now, I'm not looking to make a career out of this. Lol. But it's great for a summer job. Plus, I get employee discounts!"

"event","Well, I leave here on Thursday, May 8th. I am not quite sure if I am going to take my exam on Thursday morning or afternoon or on Wednesday night yet. I know my parents are coming down on Tuesday to take some of my larger belongings and then I will take the rest of my shit with me on Thurs. 

It's going to be weird leaving Randolph. I've grown accustomed to this abode. I definitely like my room here on the 1st floor 10 times better than my hellhole room on the 3rd, 

I am excited for summer. So much possibility. I hope to eat a lot healthier. Lately I have been eating ice cream, popcorn, and crackers for dinner. I don't want to bother venturing to Moody because often, I sleep too late to even catch a meal. 

But yes... this summer I hope to find a nice job (preferably at the Wild Bean, crosses fingers) but if not, maybe someplace else nice downtown. And I want to start running with my dad, and also riding bikes with mom and dad. They called me from the trail today and said they had biked 5 miles up and were heading back. I was jealous! I want to get outdoors and get in shape and stop being such a bum. : ) 

Goodness. I also want to read some for pleasure. I have so many books I've been meaning to read. I think this summer I will set some priorities. I simply must limit my exposure to this dreadfully addictive Internet (easier said than done). I really want to read at night before sleeping, instead of staying up till godawful hours of the night online or watching television. I want to start doing exercises quite regularly. Dad would be pleased if I decided to run with him. I have that urge in my bones to run. And spending time with friends is a must. I missed my babies during this school year. Now we have so much to catch up on and I know this summer will be full of reunions, at my uncle's camp, wherever. We are going to have a blast.

As for now, I definitely should sleep, or at least read something for pleasure. James let me borrow 3 of his Chuck Palahniuk books and I look forward to reading them (along with 100 others from my bookshelf at home).

I am talking to my friend Chelsea, who is pre-law and history major. She is super intelligent and also extremely witty. We are discussing how most ""adults"" start conversations with ""What do you want to be when you graduate?"" or something to that nature. Often, I just want to tell them to suck it, but I end up going into a rant about how I simply don't know, but it would be cool to do...(and then I begin to relate all my interests until they get tired and walk away). 

Ahh yes."

And flirting with the idea of acquiescence 
Fleeting moments of firmness
Followed by flagrancy.
O, the federal system of emotions.
Filed into formal niches.
Void of individuality
Lacking finesse."

"event","I was just looking at my high school yearbook from our Senior Year. It's incredible how much has already changed. Now, my best high school friend won't even talk to me. It's all good. Things change. Hopefully one day we can look back and realize that it was all just a bunch of worthless drama. I hope.

Now I have to do my Gender Role Violation paper. what a load. I violate gender norms daily. I don't even know what to write, because I didn't do a specific act. But I have a few ideas I might like to put down on paper. I hope no one else reads them but the professor because a few are a little personal. 

Tomorrow is my last official day of classes before Spring Break. I have classes from 9-10:20 and then 10:30-12 and then from 1:10-2:40 and then I have to have Spanish consultations from 3:30-4:20. After that, I will rest up a little bit until dinner and then I have CASA from 7-9. James asked me to come up to his apartment tomorrow night, but I am still not sure I am going to take him up on that. First of all, I will be tired from the day and I want to leave tomorrow for home. 2nd of all, if he wants to mess around...I'm menstruating. Yeah I know, it can happen, but I don't feel like it this weekend. I think I am just going to pass his offer up and spend it by myself and then head home in the morning. I think if he really wants to continue this, he won't mind if we don't see each other for a week or more. It's all good. I'm fine with that. 

So yeah I am going to work on that assignment...write down some about how I am a man in the bedroom. That should be interesting."

   Muscles better and nerves more.

   again and again and again
   kiss, i like kissing this and that of you,
   i like,, slowly stroking the, shocking fuzz

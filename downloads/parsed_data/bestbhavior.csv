"event","It's Saturday!! Finally a day off from my normal exhausting routine of sleeping, eating, internet-ing, and the occasional errand/chore.  What, jealous? I'd be if I still had to work or go to school.  But I get a break cause I'm a mama to be!

Usually B. works on Saturdays but today he has the day off as things are a bit slow at work.  This is a mixed blessing because I get to spend time with him and try to sweet-talk him into doing stuff around the house, but I also have to feed him and listen to him try to get ME to do stuff around the house.

In other news, we are moving soon! I don't say this because we actually found a new place, but I gave our 30 days notice yesterday so we ain't staying here after this month.  Hopefully we will find and get a good place within the month.  We were hoping to rent this place that is right next door to one of our friends, they have an 18 mo old and another on the way so that would be cool re baby support.  Plus it's a really nice area and just the right size and price and it has a !!dishwasher!! which would kick ass.  But I guess some college girls have first dibs as of now so I'm trying not to get my hopes up.

I snagged the listing at the rental place we are renting from currently and for once they actually had some places that sound pretty good.  Once B. decides that it's worth his while to get dressed we are going to drive by a few.  They are all 3 bedroom places with garages that allow pets and are under 1500 a month.  It will be great to move into a bigger place, but we are also getting another roommate so there won't actually be a baby room, which is kind of sad because I feel a strange urge to decorate with a Winnie the Pooh theme.  Oh well.  Without the two roommates throwing down rent money we wouldn't be able to afford a place that size anyways.

<lj user=starkrg> and <lj user=themonkeyrobot> may be coming by today, but the three of us are all kind of bad at setting stuff like this up so we will see what happens."

"event","Ta da, I have a LiveJournal.

The amount of time I just spent choosing my layout and colors and whatnot is probably equal to or greater than the amount of time I will spend writing entries before losing interest and ceasing to update.  But don't it look cool?

The past few days have been quite eventful, internet-wise.  Not only did I finally sign up for a LiveJournal, I also got a Gmail account.  I am now officially with it!  Oh, and I joined Teh (New) Soapbox.  Hopefully I will be able to keep up with it, the old one just got too overwhelming for me, plus a lot of cool people stopped boxing and I missed 'em.  Plus there was that whole being-without-internet thing and the getting-pregnant thing too, which I suspect are related.  At any rate, I now have internet access and much free time to sit on my larger than normal ass, press my rotund belly up against the desk and typy-type to my hearts content.  Usually in the wee hours when B. is snoring away behind me and all various pets and roommates are also down for the night."

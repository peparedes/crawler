I know that its a good thing that he likes another girl i mean wow thats great an whats better is she doesnt like him so yeah but still i really want him back into my life. But i cannot show him that i wish he would be cool with me again. I really would love to be friends again. MOVING ON i need to get a life like a totaly new one.

"event","again today I feel the same way. Yet again the family fights, dragging me down with them. (Yeah i can't go into deal tail so thats all i am going to say about the family things) For some reason I still feel lost, but for wat i still do not know. I am going crazy trying to find wat i am missing. While things go on I try not to get to happy afraid they might coming falling down again. I am just deeply depressed over the smallest thing (a guy) I don't know why? I should not feel anything nor should i feel pain. But yet I try an Try to get rid of it an then it all blows up. I hate this. I feel like I can fall an nothing could save me. I know all my friends are right here next to me ready to help at any given moment but i can't feel it. I don't feel much, i only feel cold an hate rudhing through my vains. I don't mean to be a bitch or mean but it just comes out that way. I have bad problem like when i get deeply depressed or very angry i don't and wont eat I just can't bring myself too. I am thining an I don't want to. I worry to much about wat others think instead of wat i think. I need to get away but not far away. I want to live some where else not with my family. I want ot go to the same skool stay with my friends but i get the sick feeling i wont be able too. i am doing all i can fighting everything that comes or has yet to come my way. I say a lot but dont do it an from this point on I will say wat i gotta say. I need to come out of my SHY shell an say wat has to be said. Yet I still cannot do wat needs to be done. For I think i fear rejection from the one I love. I fear he wont care enough that his once bold loving heart has fled from him leaving him with rage an hate. I think I too have lost the same part he too has lost. Together we could try to get that part back but together we fight. I don't like to fight with him for I love him but yet something has brought us to hate one another which distroyz wat we could have fixed. I have to go babysit now bye"

"event","I feel so lost alone in this world again. I try to go on with a broken heart, but its so hard to forget that love i have. It burns with such anger yet, craves the love, attention it needs from a male. Everyone I see seems to be happy with someone they either like or love. Me I feel so broken, unloved, lost, forbidden to find another. It's like every time i start to like a guy he gets all weird an stops talking to me or tells me ""oh i only like you as a friend."" I don't know why but alot of people think I can get with any guy. I know it's sorta true but I just don't feel right. Something is wrong with me, with my life. I can't help but to get sad an very lonely. I guess I care so much of others that I tend to forget that I too am very lonely in life. I always try to make others happy when I should look at myself. Also alot of peoplt think I am very blonde or just don't have enough brains. When to be honest I have a lot of brains but i don't like to be smart cause a lot of the time you get used or you just are really smart.....I don't know. All I know is that I do have brains an just because I am blonde doesn't mean I have to be stupid. I know that the way I act makes me look weird or stupid but once you get to understand I am a very normal person with a loveing personality. I just hate how guys don't really give me that chance thye take one look an that's it. I hate that. But when I met ""him"" I was me inside an out. I had nothing to hide from him. What I showed him I could not show others. I showed him my love. Tell this day I do still love him very much but, I don't show it anymore. Something happened that I cannot explain nor tell myself. All I know is that since November 15, 2004 I lost a big chunck of myself. I have changed from once a happy loving young lady to a bitter old bitch. An so I wonder what it was that has left? Could it be my heart that was once full of hope an love? Or my other half that was full of great good, happieness, love, an lost of spirtit? well i have to go so i will be back later"

     I don't want this fighting to keep on going. I wish this would all just disappear into a dream of nothing. All the love has drain away from my bleeding palms. I sing nothing but a sad song. I sing about the pain & the hurt i have done but felt. I am lost 4ever ina world of nothing. I must live the way people tell me too, instead of the way i feel. People express them selves in ryhme & music and others cannot. I feel the rhythm & the beat but no words to that beat. the people who are together look so beauteful. But me, I have not love no one to share food, drinks, seat, or even a hug with. But I guess that's okay when your hearts on overdrive! But my only saying to finish my sad life off is sorry I couldn't be perfect cause I was lost 4ever in a world of nothing made by people that are probly not like some of you. Sorry I just couldn't be perfect in a world of nothing...
The rhythm & the rhymes say when it's time.....

Love is a great thing.
Love can also be a horrible thing.
When I think of you, i think of love.
You told me you loved me, then turned away.
I told you I'd be there for you, now I'm gone.




i am shattered once again"

CLAVEMAN IS BACK UP...... but no new one BOOOO.....OMG ITS FREE BISCUIT FRIDAY AT POPEYES. yeah ne ways today has been weird. I spent a lot of time with my dad hoping i would be able to go Bowling with my brother an friedns. Well i guess not cause he said no.... I wanna cry i wanna go out but im grounded for a lot of reasons.....1)ditching an getting cought 2)doing drugs an get cought again 3) grades mom got cought trying to hide my grades. Wow im a great kid...NOT hahahahaha  Oh by the ways the Canadian Pirates name is Captian Mo' LOL ne ways yeah i dont got to much to talk about just that i am ready for skool.  speaking of skool here are my grades
1-Us History - F im going mad in that class
2-Math - C working on it
3- World History- F doing my best to get the grade higher
4- Photo - F trying to make up all my missing work. I just hope i can do it before more grades come out....
5 ENGLISH - B or C I am doing really good.... i hope..... 
6- Study skills- F i dont care.
I really hate my life but hey at least i got great friends that help me through everything. I loe ya all. I STILL HATE YOU SHAWN. jk im over it thanks to mellie. I realized that if shawn an i were met to be faith will let it be or maybe not.

lol i that pic was the best outta the best. I miss the good times but there isnt much i can do for the group. We all are drifting away an there isnt much we can do other then try to fix teh broken parts. 1) Get all of us in the same area again. 2) talk to everyone at one time 3) i need to work things out with Red an Melissa (my friendships with them) 4) Mellie is finally talking to Nathan again =) ( who knows they might be friends still) 5) get the group back together again....Now the problem with all of that is Me an Red needs to lighten up like he was. An me i need to be less mean towards people an i too need to lighten up on things. It's hard for me when you live with this family. See I have changed an it has gone from ""not so annoying, bitchie, mean, bitch to being all of that an MORE. 
Hopefully this whole spring break thing has worked....

Zoey off of MewMew Power

Hey. I am so pissed off right now that I am ready for school already. I am going to bitch out someone for being a JERK. I put so much into the ""friendship"" an all I got was crap. I am over it! SCHOOL ON MONDAY WON'T BE PRETTY. Don't you just hate it when you like someone, then you date them, then they turn an break your heart? Well he says we're friends but then he talkes crap behind my back. Says I'm annoying. Well all I gotta says is he hasn't seen annoying yet. Until he is 6 feet deep underground he will NEVER know how annoying I can or will get. I am gonna make him regrute he ever got or even knows me NOW!!!!!! Uh-huh so um moving on.....Yeah so I am looking forward to Friday nite or Saturday nite when ever Mellie tellz me when its going to happen. Lol it sucks Cladies Claveman's website isn't working still an I am getting annoyed with that. Claveman makes me feel better.... lol ne ways I just really want to go back to school now. I have had enough family time an I am going to die if i dont get aways soon. Geez I always though SPRING BREAK was to be FUN an full of happieness well not for me. Great huh yeah 
i love MewMew Power lol so does my friend Zoey. She is totaly cool I am going to hook her up with a livejournal as soon as i talk to her again. Lol She's one of my old friends from Nevada she moved down here sorta. She lives by my cousin Greg. Ne ways she thinks Shawn is cute an wants to talk with him but Melissa doesnt want me to let her so i dunno......HAHAHAHA ne ways I am so grrrr still. BOYS NEED TO DIE.

"event","Memories (part 3)
the memories that i have for you will NEVER go away. When we were together at Carl's Jrr. You would play games with me. you'd play feeties try to tickle me any way of holding me in your arms. Knott's Scary Farm was the best you got me scared by making monster noisies in my ear. You carried me on you shoulders for about 20mins. On the way home was the best being held by you i went ot sleep. Every where we went you always held me so close afride you loose me. Now that things are gone you lost me. I would do just about anything to start over. Because i learned that if you dont have a friendship first you wont last in a relationship. Yes i have so many fon memories but they can only bring me more pain then wat is needed i cant go things go places with out seeing a memorie of us. Take this one Carl's Jr. I go ther all the time but you alway came to my mind. Why is that? Because we were there every damn day. I haven't been to Knott's sice we were their. To be honset all i have of you is a picture and my memories. We had so much fun together. We would hang out every day. We called each other none stop. Every day you'd kiss me hello, good-bye, an for the hell of it. I remember one time you called me at 7pm we talked tell 10:30pm you thought that if you hung up you would lose me. Wat happen instead i lost you. I dont ever want to lose you or the memories. But on days like this you leave me no choice but to try an forget it all. My memories make me happy but can bring me pain an sarrow. One thing i remember is you said you would never leave me. But you did you did leave me. You also told me you would never hurt me but you did you left me with out saying good-bye or even why? But i know within your own fun loving memories you will never let me go that why you never said good-bye because you love me. an i love you.
I'm better off on my own (part 4)
I tryed to be perfrect but that wasnt good enough for you. I said i give you my heart an i did but now that i want it back you wont give it to me. i tryed to be perfect but it just want worth it. So i am better off on my own. I still love you an always will but it takes two to complet an for now tell things go better i am going to be better off on my own. I dont need  you dragging me down by playing wiht my emotions. You know that i love you and would do anything. Now that i see the way you treat me i wont give into any of your bull shit games. You flirt wiht her in fron of me an then she tell's me, ""oh i only do it to make you upset."" But i know that she lies cause she always talkes about you & your best friend. I see the way you look at her. You have the looks you use to give me. But im better off on my own. I dont know if things will ever go back to us but i hope that we would at least make an attempt to be my friend. I lost you once but i wont lose you as a friend you mean a lot to me. I wont forget the times we had but i want to make times for us to be friends. There is one thing if i go on my ownt i will nit g=forget you or the love you an i had togehter. i think you should here the song Pieces by Sum 41. Im not sure if that the song but its a song you should hear then think about me an the words, ""I've tryed to be perfect but it just wants worth it nothing could ever be so wrong its hard to beleive me it never gets easy i guess i knew that all along. If you believe its in myself in all the words i know just to see if it would show that im trying to let you know that im better off on my own."" Thats the chours but either way that is how i feel a lot of the time. I am trying to also let you know that i am letting og to be better off on my own. Please if you care jutst a tiny bit in your heart try to understand i tryed to be perfect but it wasnt worth it so i am better off on my own. Thereis one thing i wont leave is the look we had this morning when we both open oppostie doores the look of love/hate for one another. Before i go to be better off on my own. Wat are you going to do now that yor the nice guy whos gonna finish last when you run outta gass. lol Nice guys finish last- Green Day. There's so many songs you should hear that remind me of you. Like Sum 41 over my head ( better off dead ) i hope that things will go better if we talk this all out togheter. Becoming friends might help us both understand one another once again. But maybe im better off dead or on my own. "" I'm falling an now I'm in over my head with something i said i'm better off dead. "" I hope you understand this you asshole. I'm better off on my own. But i still love you. 





            Yeah that day was a weird ass day i wasnt my self i was very tired an very annoyed. Ne ways today has been fun i hung out with my dad an sisters all day an i am really tired as hell i think i am going to go to chruch with Megan an see everyone lol maybe i will see Shawn cause that's who chruch all the people i know go to lol.

"event","WTF???? I freaking HATE Melissa she totaly back stabed not only me but JOSH< and Shawn. The 3 of us were at Josh's moms car when Chris came over and stared shit with us. I was so mad Melissa didnt do shit. GRRRR i swear when i see her TUESDAY IM GONNA tell her straight up were not friendz if this is how everything s going to be! I didnt do shit and Chris wants to kick my ass same with Shawn and Josh (well Josh pissed her off but still!!!)I just hate it!
   Then as if thingz go and get worst i went to Battle of teh Bandz at OVHS last night with all my friends well Mellie and I were talking about it would be funny to see Shawn and Josh well we got there and SHAWN WAS THERE!!!!!! I felt bad cause i made Sara cry cause i was crying and the girls (mellie an Sara) tryed to make me feel better by having Shawn give me a hug randomly and ask wats up. Well it worked up until Sara tryed to have him do it agian and well he told her some harsh things which made me cry so before i left i had Andrew(Sara's bf and my brother) ask Shawn to come over to me so i can talk. Well Shawn and i walked out and it was raining so he stayed dry while i stood in the rain. I told Shawn how i felt about EVERYTHING then we hugged each other for a long time. I looked into his eyes for a long time and it was weird. But before i totaly left i gave him a big hug and kissed him on the cheek he turned away after words an all i did was say im sorry for watever i did and bye. Thanks to that i feel a lot better not so depressed.
 Well thats all i got to say im just super pissed off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LATERZ PEOPLE"

OK today was a weird day. 
As some people know i like Kyle well i thought i was going to talk to him today about maybe hanging out but i found out he is going to be friends with benifits with his ex-girlfriend so i didnt ask. I really like him but i dont think he likes me. Well i talked to Red sorta i only got a hug. I am going to talk to him and see if he wants to go with all of my other friends to the movies i wanna see Boogey Man. Ne ways Skool is going good things could go more better but i can ask for more the wat i already have. Lately i have been helping babysit my little sisters while my mom is off at work =) I am really tired an life is so weird. I really am doing much better on not crying =) well i gotta go laterz"

"event","OK so lets see.....

Friday- i stayed home and did nothing oh wait i babysat didnt get to chill with mellie.
Saturday- i was with my cuzin all day it was ok.
Sunday- Red & Josh's 18th birthday. =) 
Monday- it was ok no skool i hung with mellie for a bit then had to come home before i got to eat my pizza. =(
Tuseday- went to all my classes man 5th period i got out we had a horrible sub!>_< Josh gave me a ride it was chill even thought melissa fought me for front seat......
Wednesday- tryed to talk to red didnt work ditched 4 and 6th with a friend met some hot guyz chilled with them got there digits. Josh took me home almost killed nathan (not really) it was cool they left i babysat.

Yesturday- Ok that was a weird ass day i was very moody. I didnt know what i was going trough i felt out of place and tryed to be happy even though i didnt really feel happy. I got really hyper after i got something from a good friend of mine. So 5th was fun this is how it was

(BACK SETS)
Josh    Nathan
Shawn   Andrew
Me       
Melissa

Yep it was FUN. i was talking most of the time then the guys where making fun of my name tords the end. A-MAN-DA grr that was so annoying. But oh well i got over it. I was really bummed when Josh couldnt give me a ride cause he had to work at 4pm an he was giving Shawn a ride to something. So i got a ride from Sara's mom. =)

Today- 
I wasnt myself i felt outta place like i felt lost. I went to part of 2nd then i left with Kyle we got some Carl's Jr. an talked about our relationships and how things went wrong. Then we hung out on the benches by the Tennis corts and talked some more. At lunch i guess Kyle broke up with his girl Jonni. So that was sad then I was thinking about Shawn and wat Kyle said. I got really jelouse when Sierras friend was all buddy buddy with Shawn I dont know why maybe cause i still havev a stronge feeling for him. But i got mad so when he was dont i asked him and his replys:
Amanda: Hey what are you doing Saturday?
Shawn: im going to my brothers.
Amanda: Oh well u never talk to me ne more?
Shawn i dont talk to ne one after skool.
Amanda: no i mean at skool u never talk to me and u never hang out its like u dont care about me its like im NOTHING TO YOU
Shawn: -pause- no i care about u its.........
Amanda: yeah?
Shawn: walkes off
Yep thats how it was at lunch. I was crushed so i found Kyle and told him how i felt. I ended up going to class with Kyle and Melissa. I tryed so hard not to cry but i did. Ms. Harper asked me and Melissa to go out to the hall and do this paper thing for her so we did. Kyle came back and Ms. Harper told Kyle if he wanted to he could help so he didnt help but he was out there with us. After we were done i was sorta flirting with Kyle. I have liked Kyle sence i met him last year. I knew him before he dated SARA. So after skool Kyle walked home with me instead we walked half way to my house and his (Beach blv. and Newman Av.) we talked for a while tehn we hugged kyle asked me why i liked him so i told him it was because i liked him for who he was and he knew how to be nice to a girl. so we hugged an i told him that i was ok now. ( it would be cool if Kyle and i hooked upbut i feel bad for Jonni.... i am still her friend) So i wealked home stoped by Staides said hi and left. I went home and now im sitting here. I am ok i really want to call Kyle but im not going to i also wanna call Shawn but im getting over him and need to keep up on that. So i have to go talk to u later bye bye"

                                                      Lately life has been really scary. 
  
   I havent quite myself. I have been really stressed out about finals this whole intire week. I thought maybe things would be a lot easier for me if i just though about other stuff but that was a bad idea cause that just makes me worst. So i am doing the next best thing and trying my hardest to study. 

   Also things with my friends havent been to good either. I have been taking the smalliest things and turning them into drama and that has earned me the nick name Emo. So starting this morning i did my best not to take things to heart like i have been and i think i did very well. I am going to keep trying to help myself notbe to dramatic cause that has been bugging a lot of my good friends. I would hate to lose a lot of my friends cause there would hard time when i have no one to lean on lol.
 
    I am happy for my friend Mellie and Nathan they are finally going out but i am sad to say that things are not going to well for them. I <3 u mellie. I hope for the best for u two.

    Things between Red (aka Shawn) havent been going to well either. I have been trying ny hardest not to take a lot of things to seriouse but its really hard to tell if he joking or not. I really told him last friday how i felt within my heart. He told a lot of people that he would talk to me monday but that never did happen. 

     I have been really good about not crying but today i finally did. Today when Jos hwas going to take me home i asked Red why he kept calling me emo and that it really hurt me. I told him to stop and he did. When Josh and Red tryed to jump the car with Jessicas and it didnt work Josh felt bad and told me that i had to walk home in a nice way. I was kinda sad but i was ok. As i was walking away Red came up to me an gave me a hug with out me asking for one. I felt so weird and i really wanted to cry but i didnt. The guys went to their Auto teacher but i dont know what happen. I was at the pay phone and i told my mother what happend so she was on her way to come get me. As i was walking to the stairs the guys where behind me. Well i was being a moron and fell of the bar and hit the ground hard. I cryed but when i saw the guys coming i was SO EMBARESSED i wasnt to sure if they saw me or not so before they could really see my face i waped the tears away. So Red just walkes by like nothing (guess he didnt see) but Josh asked me what was i doin. I told him i was waiting for my mom he was like oh ok then. Well about 5 mins later Jessica asked me if i need a ride i told her the same thing that my mom was on her way. So she was gone. Well it was funny watching Red try and push the car. Well when i turned and saw my parents coming i guess Red really did mover the car cause when i looked back it was gone but it was like maybe not that far but i was like WTF????? lol so yeah i did cry.

   Ok what has been bringing my down the most isnt the guys its my lil sister Danielle she has something on her Thyroied and it can be one of 3 things/ treatments. 
1) sist/ thing that can be removed?
2) she can take pills for the rest of her life
3) CANCER
 3 is the one i most worried about i really dont want anything like that to happen to her. No matter how mad or upset i get at her and say things to her i will always love my baby sister. LOL what bugz me more is that she is only 9 years old. So yeah i feel more scared them her.

   Yeah i have been in a lot of family fights but lately its been all amed at me. So life hasnt been the best i got mad at my father and got in big trouble by my grandparents. Lets just say all they yelling my grandfather did at me was more torwds my father. Well i gotta go so LATERZ"

But instead he ignored me then i go to talk he tells me nothing so at lunch i asked im again.

My feelings for you are confused. I dont think i even know you."" THAT HURTS i am so f*cked up right now that all i can think of is him.

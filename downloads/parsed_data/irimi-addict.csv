"event","I thought that, as long as I'm actually posting to my LJ, I should probably write a life update as well.

I board a direct flight for Japan in 10 days.  I've been talking to my American coworkers in Japan for a bit and have sorted out getting furniture for my apartment immediately upon arrival, finding a car, and getting some friends as soon as possible (Joe, my male coworker, keeps on mentioning introducing me to the apparently popular drinking scene).  And maybe all this interspersed with a little work and climbing Mt. Fuji and some local mountains.

I received a pamphlet in the mail a few weeks ago that has aerial photos of the city I'll be in, and it looks gorgeous.  There are mountains that pop out of the city like islands in an urban landscape.  Sort of the like the hill parks in San Francisco, but on a much larger scale, usually dwarfing the rest of the city.  I can't wait to see everything, and hopefully I'll be putting pictures up.

So right now I'm sitting at home, attempting to learn Japanese, hacking my PSP and studying for the GRE on the side.  Idly considering learning C as well, though I think serious study may have to wait until I'm actually in Japan.  I've been pretty lazy so far, but I'm starting to get some energy built up to really work on everything.  Too bad it's raining out, or I'd be climbing this stone wall in front of an anonymous person's house that just begs to be crimped upon.

If anyone is in Cleveland and wants to see me before I leave, let me know!"

"event","I spent over 15 months of my life studying Japanese language.  It was incredibly difficult and I struggled the entire way.  2 of those months were in Japan, and in that time I learned more than in the rest of the 13 months combined.  The progress I made in those 15 months pales in comparison to the potential I have found by following the directions outlined in the following site:

http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/about

I have only begun studying Kanji the way outlined, a not so new approach invented by Heisig in the early 90's or even 80's.  It's brilliant and it is almost as if the method has been perfectly sculpted to fit my brain.  I learn most easily through anecdotes and stories and after only a few days of studying Kanji, I am much more confident about reading it and learning it than all those 15 months before.  I am actually becoming ADDICTED to learning kanji, a feeling well beyond even what my masochistic tendencies would normally allow.

It also allows Japanese learning through procrastination.  Amazing.  I don't want to sound like I'm super hyping the site, but I can't support it enough.  Take a look!"

"event","I just got my JET posting, and I am incredibly excited.  

Where am I going?
Tsuru, Yamanashi prefecture!

Even though I'm not as far north as I would have liked, it's almost directly in the middle of the south Japanese alps, a little bit from Mt. Fuji, and near the bullet train lines leading to Tokyo, which borders Yamanashi to the East.  Which means: SKIING!  HIKING!  BEAUTIFUL VIEWS!  LESS THAN A DAY TO TOKYO!!

Tsuru is a small city of 35,000 with a small liberal arts college of 3000 students.  It's almost exactly what I wanted, not too huge so I'm forced to learn the language again, but big enough to support my english-speaking needs, and it HAS MOUNTAINS!!!  I can't stress that enough.  They are BIG mountains, and they are within sight of the city.  Imagine having Mt. Washington in your back yard.  I am so excited I can't hold it in.

They haven't told me what age-group I'm teaching, but honestly they could give me anything at this point and I would be happy.  Sorry for all of the capitalization, but I am really, honestly, truly excited.  Especially because it's so close to Tokyo which means certain persons will have no trouble visiting, I will have no trouble visiting certain persons, and it will be easy to get high-speed internet.

EDIT:  They are the top domestic producer and exporter of grapes, plums, peaches, and wine.  What could be more amazing!  Seriously, this place sounds like paradise to me."

It is eating my soul.  I can't think about anything else, not even enough to write an interesting life update post.

I wasn't able to complete all of the skydives I wanted to, however, and am going to have to pick it up in Cleveland as soon as I get there.

Only 9 days until I get to see Grace!

I didn't believe in truly pyschotic people until last night, when someone whom I thought was a fairly good friend (having known her for only a month) blew up on me.  She decided that I was trying to guilt trip her at some point (which I was not, I know when I am thank you very much) and decided to send me a total of 12 (yes twelve in less than 24 hours) hateful text messages (to which I can't respond because my phone is half broken, and she knows it), blaming me for her own actions and attempting to guilt trip me into apologizing or whatever else.  She called me a horrible friend, inconsiderate, ungrateful, selfish, etc. all the while trying to pretend that she's just this poor innocent, non-judgmental girl whom I was supposedly treating like a jerk.  And I know it's not just me, because she started attacking other people in our group of friends because she somehow felt left out and started assuming horrible purpose behind their actions.  And then she started hanging a favor she had done for me over my head, trying to make me feel bad.  Seriously, I wasn't able to respond to her until the 11th because I was so busy wrapping up, so I it's not like something reciprocal was going on, she just sent 11 text messages to me because she wanted me to feel horrible.  And I almost did for the first 4 or so, until I realized just how crazy that shit was getting.  I will never again doubt the voracity of any of my friends' crazy ex-girlfriend/boyfriend/justafriend stories.

"event","So some may remember me mentioning cutting off the tip of my thumb four weeks ago or so.  Well, it was supposed to have healed already, but it hasn't.  I peeled the scab off two days ago and say this odd bubble coming out of my mostly healed thumb.  It had nerve endings and felt solid, so I ruled out a blister.  I thought maybe it was infected, so I went into the student clinic here at KU today and they told me this:

Best case scenario:       
-It just hadn't finished healing.

Mid-case scenario:       
-It's infected

Worse-case scenario (and most probable):
-That odd looking bubble?  Yeah, it's called a Pyogenic granuloma.
It's apparently pretty common with small wounds and pregnant women.  It consists of a small bump that grows to an average of half an inch and consists of small blood vessels and not much else.  It is almost always benign.  To treat it, the entire growth must be cut off and sometimes cauterized.  If any of the growth's tissue remains, it will grow back.

Today I got my paycheck! Which means I can fuel my new addiction to skydiving(who could be that surprised).  Lately I've been getting down on myself for not trying hard enough to get done what I want to (like relearning Japanese, keeping myself in shape, writing letters), but I think I need to stop being so pessimistic and angry at myself, and just try hard to be optimistic and keep my energy up so I can actually do it all.

I do like how Kansas is much more laid-back than Dartmouth, though.  Here people don't have that drive to do something every moment of every day.  At Dartmouth I always have trouble hanging out with friends, because most of us (or at least I) need to be doing something to feel productive, useful, and happy.  I guess that's what you get with a school full of overachievers.

Here though, people are fine doing nothing.  This was illustrated nicely to me when my friend Mary attempted to get me to just lay down and space out.  Not take a nap, just space out and let my mind blank.  Sort of like meditation, but not even that directed.  I couldn't do it.  I fidgeted, my mind flitted around, and I had to get up and leave, because not doing anything was killing me.  I think I need to take hold of myself a little better..."

Even off of a small Cessna, the wind is so strong it tugs your legs back along the plane, plaintively at first, but with greater urgency as you are pushed forward, till you're hanging past the landing gear strut staring down a tunnel 10,000 feet deep.  Then the rocking, three rocks, a tug on your head on the third, and you tip forward.  The wind starts shouting into your ears, groaning and gnashing as your body plummets down, cutting through it's wispy mass.  You flip once, watch the Cessna become smaller.  You try to arch your back like they tell you, squeeze your ass tight, lift your legs, spread your arms as if flexing, trying to tempt the air around you.  Your breathing comes hard, loud gasps as the rushing air fights you as if its life depended on it.  Look at your altimeter: 7000 feet.  You watch as the end of this wind tunnel rushes up.  You think you can see the shadow a cloud is casting on the specks that are houses below you.  Glance at those spinning hands again: 6000 feet.  You reach down, pull the bright orange tab, and 

angrily your harness bites into your skin.  The canopy deploys faster than you would have thought, and the air is beaten to submission.  The roar becomes a whisper, a flick of the canopy, a kiss upon nylon.  The worst is over and now you watch, hands in the nylon toggles, as the world spins below you, first clockwise, then counterclockwise.  You skirt the highway, imagine faces in the windows of cars that flit past, hungry eyes eating your silhouette.  Just before hitting ground you pull down 1 2 3 and hover a moment, contemplating the ground now just 5 feet below you.
Then the grass hisses, slides out from under you, tickling the back of your jumpsuit as the canopy collapses behind you."

"event","Last post I gave a little update on my job situation, mostly that I was working at Moosilauke Ravine Lodge (MRL) and then heading down to Lawrence, Kansas.  I just finished working at MRL, and flew down here to Kansas yesterday, and here are some of the things that happpened:

-At the lodge I SUCCESSFULLY cooked Risotto for over 30 people.  If any of you don't know, Risotto is probably the most Italian dish you can make, and it is incredibly fucking hard to get right.  So now I feel much more Italian and like a fairly good cook, even if the rice was a tiny bit mushier than it should have been.

-3 days before ending work at MRL, I cut the tip of my left thumb off, while chopping sweet potatoes for my FRIEND's meal (we take turns being cook at the lodge, and it was most definitely not my turn).  It didn't hurt and I was back from the hospital, working, 2 and a half hours later, but the workman's comp paperwork took literally 3 hours to fill out.  So I  would not encourage limb-removal, even at such small a scale.

-As the plane was landing in Kansas City yesterday, lightning hit ground not 30 feet off the left wingtip.  Scary, but insanely awesome to see

-I almost didn't get picked up from the airport, and I still have not seen anyone else connected with my program yet, I mean, seriously

-I spent most of yesterday hanging out with America's gypsies, a bunch of traveling hippies with some incredibly cute dogs.  I drank wine in the middle of the sidewalk, watched one or two drug deals go down, and generally had a good time.  I think that Lawrence agrees with me.

-I met my roommate, who's a really nice guy, but who might end up bringing out the worst of my anti-social tendencies through video gaming and the like.

-I miss Grace, who I saw two weeks ago for the last time for 4 months."

"event","I know that's probably a little hard to believe since I haven't posted here in months, but it is a true statement of fact.  What have I been doing in the past few months?
Well, here's a bulleted list:

-I took three amazing classes this winter, one of which was incredibly hard but I did okay in
-Over Spring Break I went climbing at Red Rocks Nevada, right outside of Las Vegas
        -I can now lead 5.11b! (which is fairly good, though I should be able to climb harder  
         than that for the amount of time I've been climbing.)
-After returning to Hanover I decided that I have been musically deprived and have been attempting to teach myself to play the piano.  However, I suck horribly and will need to continue it for years to come if I ever want to be any good.  It's nice being able to produce music though.
-I spent the first month back from spring break agonizing over my complex job situation, but eventually found that:
        -this summer I'll be working at the University of Kansas doing research on ice sheets and
         how they are affected by global warming.  This includes an amazingly large stipend from 
         the US government
        -Starting last week and until the end of May I'm working at Moosilauke Ravine Lodge, a 
         massive cabin owned by Dartmouth College in northern New Hampshire.  There I get to 
         pretty much run a hotel and cook for over 60 people at a time!  The people I work with 
         are incredibly cool and my kind of nerdy, and it promises to be really, really fun. 
-This summer I'm planning on going skydiving!  I picked out the place to do it in Kansas and will take an advanced freefall course that will get me certified to jump without instructors!  I will then be on my way to fulfill my crazed ambition of becoming a basejumper.  Unfortunately, all of this will probably drain most of the stipend I mentioned above.
-Yesterday I watched Iron Man and have to say it made me nostalgic for the marvel comic books I never read, especially when I heard a bunch of friends geeking out on it.  Still, one of the best marvel movies I've seen, it definitely exceeded my expectations.


Yeah, hopefully I'll be better at the whole LJ update thing so that my posts can be shorter over all"

"event","So I had my 10th or so scrape with death yesterday.  While climbing into and out of the Grand Canyon (a total horizontal distance of 15 miles and vertical distance of 2, yes that is a lot), I almost stepped on a rattlesnake.  For the third time during this program.  Nevermind that half of the twenty-four students in my program have never even SEEN a rattler, but I happen to almost crunch on (and get bitten by) three!  It was completely surreal, because after I backed away I saw this squirrel keep on harassing it, approaching it and scurrying away when it rattled and then dumping dirt on it, until the snake slithered off the trail.  And I got pictures of it.

But I am alive!  I am in Flagstaff, AZ after 3 nights straight of camping, only one of which gave me any decent amount of sleep.  But I'm relatively happy, coming out of a depressive slump that always seems to interrupt my terms halfway through, and am getting along with most of the other students on The Stretch, even if some of them still get on my nerves from time to time.

I really should go outside and explore the city a little bit, even though I look absolutely, positively scary with a beard that gets bushier by the second (if I didn't know better, I'd think I was a homeless vagabond, not that there aren't worse things to look like...) and the most amazing Chaco tan-lines I have ever seen (self-call, I know, but they are the symbol for the new-age hippy).  I miss Grace incredibly, but have been drowning my sorrows with this amazing webcomic:

"event","So, this fall I'm going on a program Dartmouth runs, called the Stretch.  The Stretch is run for students majoring and minoring in Earth Sciences (Geology and the like) and involves a two month long road trip throughout the Western states.  I get to study rocks in Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and California, all the while partying with some of my closer friends at Dartmouth (minus Alpha Theta), most of whom are climbers.  And Dartmouth pays for everything but the alcohol.  It's incredibly sweet.  The only thing is, I won't have internet access most of the time and will only get phone reception some of the time.  If you want drunken calls from me, give me your cell number and I'll try to hit you up.  If you'd love to send me physical mail I'd love it, and you can send it to:

Geology Off-Campus Program
Department of Earth Sciences
6105 Fairchild Hall
Dartmouth College
Hanover, NH  03755-3571

Major props to anyone who does this.  I hope to see you all when I get back in the Winter, and I'll try to update if I can while on the trip.  Have a good fall everyone!

(Also, if you live in San Francisco or in a line between Las Vegas and Hanover, give me your address and I'll try stopping by on the way back.)"

"event","Every Summer and Fall Dartmouth puts together an event of immense proportions and coordination.  Called the 50, it involves about 30 hikers and twice that many people to keep them going.  I was one of the hikers.  What it involves:

-Hiking 52.5-54 miles, from Hanover, NH to the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge
-Straight
-Without any sleep
-Over 6 mountains
-More than 10,000 feet of elevation gain, more than 10,000 feet of elevation loss
It took me 26 hours

Every 10 miles or so there are supporters who feed us hikers, give us more water, and send us on our way, provided we aren't dying.  Because you hike through the night, it is not weird at all for hikers to hallucinate.  In fact I hallucinated woodland creatures on the sides of the path just outside my headlamp's light radius all the time, but every time they weren't actually there.

I pulled my hip flexor at mile 28, right before one of the more annoying mountains (about 8 false summits at night, very wet trail) but I finished the rest of the hike anyways.  The only problem was, because I couldn't lift my right leg up more than a couple of inches by muscle alone, I had to limp in a waddling fashion, using my hips to swing my right leg up and forward.

I got back to Hanover last night and could barely get to sleep because of the pain.  I woke up this morning and could barely get out of bed, and could only digest Ramen.  My body still hurts, I have a splitting headache, and now I'm depressed.

Either I'm a badass or stupid, but either way, I almost hate myself for doing it.

And the worst part?  I paid $50.  There are actually so many people who want to do it every term it's held that they have to hold a lottery.  Apparently Dartmouth is brimming with masochists."

"event","So I just got back to Hanover from a trip to Colorado where I took part in a family reunion and celebrated my grandparents' 50th anniversary, my brother's first anniversary, my Dad's birthday, and my Grandpa's birthday.  It was replete with Italian feasts and Italian relatives from Italy who spoke nought but Italian.  It also reminded me why I'm glad to be out of the reach of my puritannical parents, who managed to make my sister cry for wearing a short skirt (and she's the one who is usually inhuman in keeping her feelings to herself).

But there were some fun aspects.  I got to play with my adorably cute cousins, one of whom is just turning three and would cover her eyes whenever she saw me, acting scared in order to be cute.  And I got to talk to my really cool Aunt (an '85, woot for Dartmouth grads) and Uncle from Alaska, who unfortunately had to worry about forest fires on the Kenai Peninsula near their house while at the reunion.  But man my Uncle made a mean risotto.  

We also tried to take my Italian second cousin Mateo out to bars and a house party, but they ended up kinda lame and I think he was disappointed, being used to more extreme parties in Europe.

I had a wonderful talk with my sister-in-law though, and learned that she'll keep whatever radical religious tendencies my brother has in check, which puts my mind at ease.

And I almost had heat stroke from running up and down a high mountain at altitude, only getting water at the very top.  Man, I can be dumb."

I really miss <lj user=""mythomanic""> and it doesn't help that I have the libido of a 19-year-old male (fancy that).  I really need to chill out and relax this summer, but the only way I can see doing that means dropping a class and only taking two, which doesn't sit well with me for the price my parents pay for Dartmouth.  Anyone got any suggestions on how to get me to focus but relax at the same time?

I'm going night climbing tomorrow (hopefully), involving only a headlamp.  It should be sweet and only mildly dangerous, but Hanover needs a little spice, right?

"event","So besides eating, which has been the number one largest time-consuming activity on this trip, I have been keeping myself pretty busy with <lj user=""mythomanic"">.

On Saturday we went to the Singapore art museum and looked at a lot of the most awesome local artists (everyone from Singapore is technically local Singaporean).  My favorite was Anthony Poon, who, despite having a tragic name, has some great art and a humorous style I like to find in artists (it keeps them from being pretentious).  Later we went out for drinks and saw the national service boys practicing for the National Day Parade coming up in another month.  Apparently this involved about 15 guys jumping from a low-flying Chinook transport helicopter into a bay while two large rafts with engines rescued them and two river gunboats ran escort.  And then two attack helicopters we had seen earlier flitting about the skyscrapers came by and performed aerial maneuvers.  All in all, pretty cool, but apparently useless for anything but a parade.

On Sunday we went sea kayaking in a two person inflatable sea kayak, which was both relaxing and fun, seeing as the water surrounding Singapore is so warm you never feel cold, not even for a second.  

On Monday we went hiking out to the Mack Ritchie (probably spelled differently) Reservoir and in the process followed a path of underground tubes and bunkers that contain the national service armory (it's pretty cool that everything is underground because of space constraints).  And we passed the gunnery school and ammunitions school, and saw a ton of signs that said don't feed the monkeys, but no actual monkeys even appeared for us to feed, which was a great disappointment, though we did see a young monitor lizard about three feet long and a bunch of turtles stacked on top of one another.

And Yesterday (Tuesday) we went to Sentosa, the little island resort off the southern coast of Singapore that has amazing artificial beaches replete with artificial boulders and beautiful views of oil refineries and manufacturing plants they try to block out as much as possible with artificial miniature islands spaced out across the beach.  Anyways, I got to burn my entire backside despite liberal use of sunscreen and had a great time swimming and staring at the tattoo clad emo/nerdy Chinese boys.  (Reminiscent of Shinen, but oh so more confused).  And then we went to underwater world and got to see one of the coolest animals in the world, the leafy sea dragon, as well as pet a bunch of sharks, stingrays, puffer fish, and sea stars.  And then later I was able to engorge myself on Japanese food at a surprisingly high quality Japanese buffet place (like, no, really, this place was wonderful, tasteful, and almost authentic).

Today I think we're at least planning on seeing Pirates of the Caribbean and I don't know what else, but let's just say I've been having a complete blast here in Singapore.  Too bad it ends today and I have to leave early tomorrow to start summer term.  :("

Then off to the art museum which was actually pretty amazing, but the sickies have taken me down and I can only hope that I get to go kayaking tomorrow.

Here's to hopes for good weather.  And good Cabo Wabo tequila, which is probably why my sentences make no sense."

But, I'm in Mother-Fucking Singapore with my girlfriend, <lj user=""mythomanic"">, and her crazy (not really, but she thinks so) family.  And it is really f-ing hot.  I just finished my most productive term and got the best grades yet (due to not taking any Japanese classes), discovered I actually like Economics, led 5.10d (the hardest climb I have ever led) and did a shitload in the outing club, mountaineering club, and Alpha Theta, and am at the point where I really just need to rest for a year.  But it's been incredible, and this has definitely been some of the best 3 months of my life (jesus, ain't that depressing) with minimal family trouble (there was some) and good food (Singapore's 2 national pasttimes: eating and shopping).

More on Singapore and my life later, I just want my friends to know I'm alive.

-Get paid at least $40 every month for at least the first three months

This is so fucking tempting, but do I really wanna risk getting caught up in the virtual world of spellcasters and warriors of bloody and violent races?

"event","This weekend was pretty hard on me, due to a situation with my family resulting in me actually calling my parents to express a vote of no-confidence in their ability to raise children without fucking them up.
But, it did help me realize that one reason I never seem to get done what I want, is I convince myself that I can't at that moment, or that I should wait, and this sucks.  So I'm trying to get over myself and back on track.  The fact that I only have to work 14 more hours at this place after today helps a lot!"

"event","I just got through another weekend working 34 hours, except this time I managed to keep my cool by having a mental breakdown BEFORE the weekend.  I feel a lot better about myself recently, and am REALLY looking forward to my mid-week weekend (probably tomorrow and wednesday, so I can go ice climbing!)

Yesterday I managed to write a poem in my head while going to the bathroom, but have forgotten since then due to a horde of Nihonjin (native Japanese peoples) running into India Queen and making me shy as hell (I've forgotten so much Japanese that I'm afraid to start conversations at all).

I've learned that the worst part about working at an outdoor rental store is the fact that you don't have the time to use the equipment you're renting out.  Part of the salary here is getting free rentals on anything in the store.  The only problem is, I have no time to use any of it.  That makes me sad.

Yay LJ at work!!!"

"event","Snow Day at Dartmouth!

President James Wright: ""All non-essential student services are closed""
Translation: My office is taking a day off, have fun in class bitches.  (He left the holding of class to the discretion of the professors, most of whom decided to have class anyways)

What it means for me:  I still have work anyways, which means I can't frolic in the snow, which means I'm going to be incredibly bitter towards Dartmouth's bureaucrats."

"event","So, this weekend (Including Friday) I managed to work at total of 32 and a half hours.
I worked until 10 PM at DXC on Friday, woke up 8 the next day to get to work at 8:30, worked eight hours, an hour off, four hours more at India Queen.  After India Queen I stopped by Panarchy with <lj user=""mythomanic""> and then wandered over to Grandma's House where we had a 

NAKED PARTY!!!!!!!

No, seriously, it started out as a huge Strip poker party (with about 10 people) and by the end it was awkward to be NOT naked.  Good times, Good times.  I need to go to Grandma's house more often.

Then woke up at 8 the next day to make it to work at 9, worked 9 hours, went to India Queen and worked through the superbowl (the commercials sucked)  and then went to sleep.

And what am I doing today?
That's right, work.

So, how is this an off-term again?"

"event","There is a chipmunk that is attempting to enter my place of work.  It seemed to be searching the door for the handle, in the process scratching the hell out of the windows.  It was really kinda freaky, almost like something out of a horror flick.  I swear it was trying to get in to eat me.  Oh, no, I think it just went around the building to try the back door.  Help!!!!!"

"event","So the weather channel has a small glitch.  The low today, according to the website, is supposed to be 24.  But it's 7 degrees out, feels like -4, and, oooohhhhhhh, a program is coming on NPR about teenagers and sleep deprivation.  Soooooo pertinent.

On another note, I just started learning Aikido again!  This makes me incredibly happy because I love the art, but I'm going to have to come up with the money somehow.  Weapons training on Friday!"

"event","I figure since my last post was about bowel movements I really should sound a bit more intelligent this time, or something like that.

Recently I've really been feeling lazy.  I go to work 40 hours a week at DXC and I work part time at India Queen on top of that.  Add in my hours at the climbing gym, and rationally one can see that it's not as if I'm not doing anything.  But it seems like I do have inordinate amounts of freetime because everyone else is running around for classes or extra-curriculars or homework while I sit in the SLR or at the Rock trying to waste time.  

It certainly doesn't help that <lj user=""mythomanic""> has the most packed schedule I've seen a human construct and hold while still being able to spontaneously produce chocolate pound cake (which was some of the most delicious chocolatey goodness on the planet, by the way).  Around her I often feel like I'm lazy, or a poor worker, and often a mooch (not having DBA really sucks), not just of food, but of her time as well.  

And on top of it all, I am coming no closer to reaching some of the goals I set for myself this term, and it kinda sucks.

But, despite all that, I am usually happy.

I really should get back to work before my boss does, tata."

"event","So, for some reason I can't identify/control, I have been having intestinal trouble.  I'm not sure if it's food poisoning, lack of sleep or stupidity, but every day my intestines rebel on me several times, and it starts hurting.  A lot.  Ughhhh.

Work blows.  I always have too much of it"

"event","Yesterday I did the disgusting.  I worked 13 hours straight except for a 45 minute break spent resolving a minor relationship conflict.  It was insane, and I am insane for undertaking it. And I'm doing it again tomorrow.
This term I:
-Have a full time job working at the Dartmouth Cross Country Rental Center (come visit me!  Especially now that it's snowing)
-Have a part time job working 12 hours a week (at least) at India Queen, and Indian Restaurant
-6 hours of A capella rehearsals (I may have to quit my group, which is a big problem because I know they won't take it well, despite my being the worst singer in the group)
-Cook three major meals (dinners) a week
-spend time with <lj user=""mythomanic"">
-make Alpha Theta events
-get in incredible shape and skill for the spring climbing season
-and on top of everything else: Read, write short stories, learn how to play the piano, see all my friends on campus regularly, take up Aikido again...

I need to cut shit from my life, but I'm not quite sure what because the first two are pretty much mandatory and take up 57 hours of my time a week.  But, on the plus side, I just climbed for an hour in the gym and took a shower, so I am very happy"

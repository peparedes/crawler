"event","Hey. I know I havent written in a while, but I think it pretty much says that on all my journal entries because it always takes me forever to write in this thing. I'm in Dallas right now with my family for my mom's birthday party. She's 45 and that woman doesn't look a day over 30 to me. I should be so lucky.

Anyways, this weekend I went to Oklahoma to visit Ashley. I wish that she lived in Fort Worth because its always so good to see her. We, of course, got completely shitfaced the first night I was there because, well...that's just what we're best at. We went to the lake and swam around and drank and it was so fun. But around 6 in the morning, while we were sleeping, it started to rain so we had to go home. I wasn't too dissappointed though because I was really drunk and so at that point it didnt matter to me if we were going to Bosnia. Yeah, that drunk. I actually fell into the tent twice. It was classic, and if I were an onlooker and saw that- hell, I'd laugh at me too.

Tomorrow is the 4th of July and so me and Mollie are going to see the fireworks with her boyfriend, Cary. Yea, I know, its a girls name, but whatever..he might still be cool even thought he's already lost a couple cool points. I wanted James to go with me but I can't get a hold of him. I'm actually starting to get really worried because I've called him three times today to see if he wanted to go and left him a message and he hasn't called me back and that's really unlike him. This kind of makes me realize how much I truly do care for him.

So, the second term of summer school is almost over. It actually ends this Thursday, which would be really nice EXCEPT I have to start the third summer term on Monday. God...when will it endddd???? At least I'm graduating next year though. When I walk across the stage, I will know I did the right thing and that all my hard work and missing summers and not being able to party as hard as everyone else will have payed off. 

Today my mom mentioned something about her always wanted to go into the Peace Corps. This kind of got me thinking. This might be something I might want to look into. I've thought about it before but I was always too scared to leave my friends and go to a completely different place where I didn't know anyone or anything. But, now that she said that, I realize that I don't want to be 45 years old and regret something that I never did that I always wanted to do. Maybe its something I should really think about. 

Alrighty, well...I gotta go."

"event","So last night me and Sarah went to Aarons and got FUCKED UP. I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.
And I had a test tomorrow which reaffirms my idea that I might be the smartest, most rational person ever. NOT
So I woke my ass up this morning in the same clothes (jeans and all) that I had worn the night before. And I call Sarah, and Im like duhhh what happened last night. And she goes on to tell me how I was being EXTREMELY friendly to this group of girls one minute, and then the next minute I was passed out in the lawn chair in the front yard. I'm ""that drunk girl"". Yup, thats me. So thats why im embarassed (see my mood today) but Im not really embarassed because Ive made fun of so many people that were fucked up, that I figure its my turn to be at the center of ridicule. 

Mallory left on Sunday. VERY sad about that. I don't know what else to say except I will miss her so, so, so much. I could tell her anything. And I know I still can, but it will just have to be over the phone, which sucks. 

Me and James have started talking again and hanging out a lot. I dont know how I feel about this really so far. He has hurt me in the past, and I know this, but for some reason, we have agreed that we just CANT hate each other. Its impossible. It feels like he could do anything to me (not that I want him to) and that I will always have a certain place for him in my heart that keeps me from telling him to go away. Because I really don't want him to go away. But I dont know how I feel about dating him again. I'm being extremely guarded right now.

I got my schedule and I figured out that I got the three days off that I requested so that I can go see ASHLEY!! So a trip is being planned for the 17, 18, 19th of June. Im really happy I get to see her, havent seen her since spring break.

Okay, well now I must go to my fabulous job at the rec center where I get to watch hot guys sweat and work out without their shirts and stuff. But I also have to see the really fat guy in spandex who asks me for the largest towel that we have because he's gonna go sit naked in the sauna. shudder. But I think the first DEFINITELY outweighs the latter. Peace homies."

I'm thinking maybe I should start writing on this thing again, and if its only for my benefit, and no one else reads it, that will be okay too. 

Well, school is almost over. I have one last final tomorrow, and then Ill officially be a senior in college. I think its funny that the last time i wrote in this thing, iwas a senior in HIGH SCHOOL. WHERE DID THE FUCKING TIME GO?

I just got a job from the TCU Rec Center. So, yeah. I'm a card swiper. And I get to watch nice looking boys sweat all day..."

I spent them waiting here for you.
Now your charity's refused,
I can name a penance for abuse.

Twenty four years overdue,
what kind of role model are you?
Very least learn not to do,
I think I might be over you.

Do hope I won't 
Learn to make 
The same mistakes, 
That you would 
Make me aware 
That only fear, 
My only hope, 
Is letting go.

Went on a limb for you,
Capsized when I turned twenty two.
Did it burn as bad for you?
No bottle serves to soothe my wounds.

Last night was Kyle's birthday and I went over to Jacobs because there were people over there. It was verrrry fun!
I get to go to a wedding tomorrow and Im so excited, I love weddings.
I cut of four inches of my hair today. AHH where did it go??? I cant believe I had the guts to finally do that...I had to go to SuperCuts because thats all i could afford. Man, I am broke as a joke"

"event","Today, in philosophy i was chewing on my gel pen and it EXPLODED IN MY MOUTH. (that just SOUNDS sexual doesnt it) I WAS SO EMBARASSED i had to like run to the bathroom and scrub my face my tongue for like 10 minutes and to make matters worse, it was a freaking green pen. UUUghhhh...!!! It was kind funny though, if i would have seen someone do that, I would have laughed at them too. 
I really hate it when people you know walk by you and they pretend like they don't see you..they do that kinda gazing off into space sorta look, like they can't see you in their periphal vision. I always just want to get in their face and be like HEY WHATS UP HOW YA DOIN NICE TO TALK TO YOU...bitch!! Doesnt happen that often, just happened today and it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.

This weekend I get to go to a wedding on Saturday. I lovvve weddings. Especially if theyre open bar. (Which this one is) 
Annie's boyfriend is in town for his spring break. They are so adorable, but so different. I think its great that two people that have such different personalities can love each other so much. 

My family is SO tight on money right now. I think the only money Im going to get for the next month or so is the money I make from taking care of Jordana and since I only watch her like two days a week, that leaves me with like 50-70 dollars a week, which is a HELL of a lot more than I get from my mom and dad. But I dont get paid till next week. So im tragically broke. :( 

Well, Im going to sleep for alittle while before my lab...I havent been sleeping very well lately and i dont know why..By the way...
Lately, I have been dreaming a lot (when I do sleep), and for some reason, Ive been remembering my dreams, which is so unusual for me. And I've been having so many dreams every night, that during the day, I find myself not remembering if my ""dream"" really happened in real life the day or week before, or if it really was only a dream. Like Ill dream that I did my laundry or something and then realize the next day that my laundry basket is full and I never did it even though I thought I really already did..Ive been doing that A LOT lately. WHat is wrong with me>?
Ok byebye"

"event","Look like someone's gotta case of the Mondays!!! And this one is particularily a bitch because its the one after spring break. Can't say I had the best one ever, but it was fun while it lasted. At times. Err...Too much to type and too many times told and too many times annoyed...
But anyway. Today I get to spend time with Jordana! 
March Madness is fucking CRAAAAZY!!! Kentucky got beat? Whaaaaat?? Oh well, doesnt matter, just as long as my beloved Duke still wins.
We have 6 more weeks of school..which is not very long at all because it includes exams. Then summer. Why is it that I always want to get through something and go on to the next big part of my life...like in high school, i couldnt wait until college and now i cant wait until grad school and then i wont be able to wait until i get a job and a house and a family, etc. And then where will I go from there...Maybe I should learn to sit back and enjoy the moment. I forget sometimes that there's a present, not just a past and future. 

Oh well. I love you.


Q: Do you think I could ever be truly happy?

A: Would you mind if I made it my job to see that you always are?

They dedicated ""Shes Just Destroying the World"" to me, which is my favorite song by them. If you wanna check it out, go to natchettaylor.com and click on audio, download and then that song. 

I wish I knew of someone who 100% knew ME.

Take that back. Maybe just 50% of me and then I'd be content. 

Does Robert DeNiro freak anyone else out?

Oh okay then loves, Im off to bed. 
SO MUCH ON MY MIND!!!

"event","So, uh. i just realized i still have live journal. 

boredom + new computer = realizing that i still have live journal from like a year ago.


So yeah I read my ""recent entries"" from six months ago and realized how much ive grown up since then. This should be fun writing in this thing again...i always thought my account just went away or something when i didnt write for months but i guess it didnt.

I will now start a new tradition in my live journal. 
Everyday I will write down an ""ebonic"" word of the day. This way, I can go back and study them and then i can be fluent in ebonics therefore becoming the true strong black woman i was really born to be. word.

The word for today..

OMELETTE.
Want me to use in context. Sure.

A'ight brotha, omelette this one slide this time, but next time, its a cap in yo asssss.

Peace.. Tupac lives.

1) Went to school, failed a biology quiz
2) went to art aide, ordered ming court with miguel and murphy
3) got pissed of at basketball, almost lost my mind because the stupid machine wouldnt give me a diet coke? sound high stressed? trust me, i was.
4) went to english were i totally BSed my discussion topic
5) went to afterschool basketball practice and wasted my time shooted a 100 freethrows.
6) went to the grocery store with my mom and bought healthy foods because i realized what a fat ass i am.
7) made ashley a present. shhhhhhhhhh she'll love it
8) talked to james. dont want to divulge details
9) went to HEB again and realized that the greatest band in the world is saves the day...
listen to these awesome lyrics and tell me theyre not talented:
Tonight will be the night that we begin to ease the plugs out of the dam.
And we still stand knee deep in the flow, 
the undertow will grab our heels and won't let go.
Abd while we hold, our legs quivering, 
the water rises now to our teeth when we just let go
and sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping our backs.
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that we have
and all the wasted nights and empty moments in our lives 
are flushed away as we sway with the rhythm of the waves bobbing us up.
Crests fall to troughs as we feel our gills open up
and sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping our backs.
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that we have.
And if the hook set in the bottom of our lungs, 
we'll rip it out and lick the blood off with our tongues.

Despair could ravage you if yo turn your head around 
to look down the path that's lead you here, cause what can you change?
You're a vessel now floating down the waterways.
You can take your rudder and aim your ship,
just don't bother with the things left in your wake.
Just sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping your back.
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that you have
and your love will be warm nights with pockets of moonlight
spotlighting you as you drift, the actor in this play.
You walk across the stage, take a bow, hear the applause,
and as the curtain falls, just know you did it all
the best that you knew how and you can hear them cheering now.
So let a smile out and show your teeth cause you know you lived it well.


See ya later."

"event","Ugh. Another dumb day. Today James ditched me to go smoke weed with Sean. that sure makes me feel loved. i got mad and now he's not talking to me. surprise. its always my fault. today my shoulder was killing me but i didnt tell anyone because i was trying to downplay it as much as possible so i could play on friday. coach told me that i might not play just so that i would be well when ""it really mattered."" Like it doesn't matter now? She drives me fucking crazy! I want to play, but secretly i am scared about my shoulder. today we watched colin powell give his speech to the UN in economics. Its really scare to be so close to war...i cant understand why people would not want to go to war, because if we don't, its scary to think of the possibilites of what might happen. I don't think they really know what human beings are capable of. Anyway, after ""practice"" me and adrienne went to the boys basketball game and we saw some awesome jump ropers during half time. hah. 
Check it out:

as im leaving
a change comes on my eyes
these streets persuading me
with mumbles strange goodbyes
and through the water
through the ring
to the soul of everything
throw my heart out
on the stones
and im almost gone
and theres no meaning
in clothes and coffee sups
cheap hotel furniture
where silence never stops
and through the water 
through the ring
to the soul of everything
throw my heart out 
on the stones
and im almost gone
and now im dreaming
im staring at the walls
at cars all frozen now
in late night waterfalls
and through the water
through the ring
to the soul of everything
wash my heart out
on the stones 
and im almost gone

see ya"

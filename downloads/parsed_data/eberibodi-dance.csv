Today started out nice.
I woke up at a good time (6:15) and was ready to leave by 6:25 (im just that fast... hint:I wash the essentials at the sink- no time for showering eeeeverything till night)
My mom offers me a ride to the ferry (yaaaay!!!) so I just put on whatever clothes I see first and my bag and get the hell out of my house before she leaves me.
The ferry ride was nice.. I sat outside in the front on the floor outside... it's nice there. And my mp3 player had batteries.
When I got off the ferry I realised something was amiss
""shit... my wallet""
I really didn't feel like being late for first period... being any later than the teacher was a shame since he would ALLLWAYS come in like... 30 minutes late. So I tried to get the subway people to let me on and get to school... they told me to go home.... I contemplated not going to school today but figured Im already awake. So I waited for the people from the 7:00 boat to arive.. surely they would lend me money.. AND THEY DID =D.. Duane shows up outa nowhere with like.. a wad of cash (w00t) so I get to school on time.
Getting money to go home was not hard at all. Most people know that if im demanding money they better give it to meh (im THAT scary).
So the school day ends with me learning crap. I go to dekalb station and put money on the metrocard.
I was so happy I even showed someone where fulton street was.. by walking them there.
I return to the station.
I swipe the card.
Insufficiant Fare...
I figure I should be a good little girl and explain to the booth lady my situation. After all, I had a receipt!!!
The booth lady was all ""the mta will send you your $2 in the mail"" 
""But i need to get home now""
""that's not my problem. You must buy another metrocard""
""I have no money. I would normally have a student metro card. How am I supposed to get home?""
""-incoherant mumbling-""
""......""
""next costomer please""
I checked the station for any type of authority and waited for the lady to talk to another costomer
-hop- 
I was so angry I didn't realise what happened when I hopped the turnstyle but i'll get to that later...
I had an empty water bottle on me and in frustration, and plain old wanting to make a loud angry noise I slammed it against the wall.. Some old fat white dude looked at me funny so I gave him a ""wtf you staring at"" look and he seemed pretty scared.
The rest of the train ride was pretty fine aside from slightly high blood pressure and being upset that I had no transfer for the bus.
Then I realised. My knee..
I tried climbing the stairs at whitehall station and discovered a throbbing pain.
I must have hit it on the turnstyle when I jumpped over.
The ferry ride was once again nice, Some chick sat right next to me and coppied my style of sitting (lotus position on the floor).
Thankfully the busdrivers on staten island aren't like the ones in queens and just let you on if you make up any excuse whatsoever... and you know.. are a chick...
so anyways the moral of this story is
My knee hurts.... and the MTA sucks!!(sept on staten island)... and I miss Kan.. she's still not online"

"event","there is only one boy in my life who even remotely matters to me.
mikey.
i know i've been immature about boys in the past and i regret it.
but this boy is so much different than anyone else i've ever met.
he means the world to me.
i can be myself around him, i can wear sweat pants and no make up, i can goof around, i can feel totally comfortable, i love kissing him, i love it when he holds me, i love making him eat, i love partying with him, i love taking care of him, i love having sex with him, i love everything about him, every little quirk, everything.
i would do anything and everything for him.
he's amazing.
i never thought i ever would or could find a boy life this for ME.
i'm unbelieveably happy with him.
this is why i'm sitting up at 7:30 on a friday morning after trying to go to bed at 4.
i can't sleep because we had a bad night (which ended up ending good)
i can't sleep knowing we aren't on good terms.
and i hate fighting with him and i really want him to know that.
it breaks my heart when he's unhappy with me and i just want him to know that from the bottom of my heart i never meant to do anything wrong to him and i just want him to be happy with me.
that's all.
i want us to be happy together all the time.
i want to be a good enough person for him because he is above and beyond a good enough person for me.
i love him so much.



(and don't worry, all the entries are still here, they are under private, for my eyes only because in reality i wrote them for me and no one else really was supposed to even see them except for me. we can look at them together after this weekend but while i'm gone i don't want you sitting and dwelling over them baby. it was a long time ago and i was a different person than i am now. please don't be mad.

i love you with all of my heart, please don't even let what happened last night happen again. i love you i love you i love you i love you i love you i love you i love you.)"

"event","well its been along time since i wrote in here, im real dperessed so i thought i would. Well where can i start? iv been working my ass off at work and im getting sick of it, Seems like all i do is drink away my depression when ever i get the chance just so i can feel good for a little bit. i got bills out of my ass, but hopefuly this time next month ill be on top of them. Eric has been in hospital for he past 2 nights and 3 days, but he should be out today. The 1st night was the hardest i think bc i was going to leave at like 8:30pm go home get something to eat and bring clothes back, but shannon had to leave 1st and when she came back she decided that chico was gonna stay, so i wasnt mad just extremly hurt, and i didnt want to cause problems between them by saying no im his and not him, he has no right, instead i just held in what i felt and just left&nbsp; mins later, when i got outside to go to my motorcycle i just started crying....it was hard enough being there, bc last time i was there eric was born and i spent 3 nights there beside shannon and with eric, i was soooo happy, the best time in my life. Then the next day i spent it there w him, and he was sooo miserbale i dindtknow what to do for him, when i held him he wouldnt stop crying like he didint know who i was =(, i tried to comfort him but he just wouldnt stop crying and i felt like crap bc it felt like he didint know im his dad. i&nbsp; was the worst feeling in the world. i went and got him some real nice clothes from vicki's work, platted shorts, a soccer hat, a dress shirt, a t-shirt and a polo shirt. Then the next night i spent it there, and it felt so weird cuz i couldnt stop thinking when he was born, so i just went outside and had a smoke to relax me. Iv made so many mistakes in my past and i just wish i could go back and change them. i miss my parents, im in 2 minds about moving in feb cuz of little eric. Well i got to go to work now so im gonna leave off on that note, later guys!"

"event","Well i keep on being bugged to updated this fucking thing, so here iam finaly doing it. Well where can i start with all the damn hetic shit thats been going on? Its my bday soon, april 11th! YAY!! ill be 21!!! Shit sounds like im getting old =(. Wish i was peter pan where i can stay young with no worries and have everything planned out for me by someone else and stay in never never land,lol. I miss my family like crazy, its getting me down so much , even more than i thought it would, when ever i wake up i cant wait to call them. Well also that has been going on is me and jenelle, i love her lots, im in love with her. But dealing with her is harder than i ever thought it would be. She tells me to read her lj, so i do after about te 3rd time her asking me bc for some weird reason she just cant ""tell me"". And when i do all it says is mean ass shit about her and me, which i guess is ment to make me second guess&nbsp; her and me or get me down, yea w/e. And when i say something to her, all she says is well i see you just read the bad things, So i went back i read the whole thing again, and im sorry it said one good thing, but to me 7 bad things out weigh one good thing. Sometimes its like i have another mom around me like im 13 yrs old checking up on EVERYTHING i do. She logs my aim convos so she can read them, has my myspace password, and aim password, computer loggin password and checks all of them every day. its like i have no privacy, no room to breath without her knowing im breathing. Its all getting to much for me to take. The way she acts i see so many traits that were in shannon and it scares me bc i dont want it to turn out like shannon and me did, bc i ended up the worst one off in ALOT of ways, and if i try to approach her about that she flips out bc she thinks im comparing her to shannon which im not. Her x broke her arm and so she lived in a shelter for awhile, and even the other day she told me that "" thats why i dont want to spend time with billy bc i dont know how i will feel about him and might get confused"". So doesnt that make me insecure? Hell yes it does. Then she kids around about liking some girl at work called meagan and how if they did anything she just wouldnt tell me, but the fucked up thing about it is that i know she would do that and does like her bc she has addmited it to me b4. And i love my son over anything in the whole entire world, and lately i have been seeing him when i want to which is fucking awsome!! =). But i have to be civil with shannon so i try my best i can at that now so i can see him when i want to. But on saturday he was supposed to come over but just bc jenelle wanted to be lazy and sleep in she asked me not to have him over, so me being me said okay and he came over monday instead, and when shannon had to come pick him up, she was here like 20- 25 mins and lee was here for 5 of those mins, abd bc i just got done feeding him and heather came over with lee to see eric i didnt have time to clean up his bottle and clean up his toys and his other stuff, so when shannon came i had to do all that and help get his stuff out to her car for eric and kiss him goodbye and talk to her about him. And jenelle freaked out bc she was here ""to long"". See in my eyes when you love someone it doesnt matter who you see or what comes infront of&nbsp; you if its has something to do with your past or present your going to love that person, not be worried about if they hangout one of them is going to get confused and wont know how they feel, like she has said about her and billy. Eric has a Doctor appointment on 13th of april and i want to go bc i missed one of his appointments to go to one of jenelles already and bc he is my son and i love him no matter what. And she thinks bc shannon is going to be there at his appointment&nbsp; (duh) and so am i, she called billy and told him she wants to hangout with him on tuesday for the whole day just to justify me going to my sons appointment, which there is no justification needed at all. And i the other day i spoke to shannon online just cuz to keep things civil and we talked about bikes, and bc jenelle checks on everything i do she saw it in my aim log she keeps and freaked the hell out on me. Now i wud undersatdn if it was saying i love u, i miss u, great seeing you blah blah or even if jenelle didint speak to billy every other day on the phone about everything and anything bc news things w a baby dont happen ever other day so thats not an excuse bc i know i have a damn child, but it was about motorcycles bc im trying to keep things civil bc the nicer i am to shannon the easier it is to see my son. And if things aint done at the right time to jenelle is isnt right or not done at all. its like i cant do anything right. like this monring i aint gonna lie i had to crap big time (i ate shitty food the day b4,lol) and i was asking her to get out of the bathroom and do her make up in the mirror in the hallway, and she wouldnt just to be subborn and i budged her with ym chest kidding around for her to get out and she turned round pushed me so i chest bumped her back not hard or mean just to say dont push me like that when im kidding around and gotta take a crap. and she stormed out and when she was talking to her mom she said to her mom i slammed her against the wall, which is total over exageration and bs. well this is long enough now and off my chest so later guys!!!"

"event","well its been a bit since i have updated this thing so here it goes. My parents have moved back to england with my sister, she is going to uni over there to be a journalist, and my dads bussiness is going real good and he had a 2nd interveiw today for a job and it pays 85,000 pounds a yr which is $150,000 a yr which is okay i guess. My bike is still scratched up, but i should have it fixed by the end of april, its going to cost $2,500 to fix. I got pulled over lastnight going over the 3 mile bridge going 85 in a 45. So i got to go to court for that, oh well. I got a good job it pays $16.50 an hr, so thats $2,600 a month, hope it all works out well because with noone around me to help me out if i need it will screw me up, and i dont want that to happen =(. I really worried about things working out for me. Because unlike some people i dont have someone cradling&nbsp;everything i do. I got to take my demostic violence classes soon which i think is total bullshit. I think on the whole deal of that i shouldnt of stopped the state attourny from punishing my physco ex. Since the person she went to, to egt the restraining order said to her "" i dont see why your not in there right beside him!?"", i lost so much in the past yr and 6 months, 05 mustang, friends, jobs, family talking to me, bc of one person. The only good thing i got out of everything is a beautiful son named Eric Matthew Banagan who i barely see, so some times i wonder to myself was it ever worth it? But when i see him i know it was. Im dating jenelle. its been about a month, i wish i met her like a yr ago. It just shows me what i missed out on in the past year and a half. i love her and i thought it would be weird feeling like that again. But it wasnt. The only thing im scared of is when she has her baby im going to be around her son more than mine. But i applied for child custody help, so i can get joint custody of eric, even tho right now shannon has just as much right over him as i do. Because now i got somewhere&nbsp; to live in a home thats stable, a great job so ill be earning more than the jaworski house hold, and i have someone with me to look after him when im at work who is going to be a mom also. When shannon doesnt even have a job, relies on her gram for everything financial wise, who is 71 yrs old and hands him off to her when she decides to go out w out him. Oh well. Im moving back come feb 07&nbsp;neways. I just got off of work and im tired so im going to spend some time w jenelle."

And all you do is hand him off to your gram all the time for your friends, she is more of his mom than you, and ur going to be just as bad of a mom as your own mother"

She sits there and says how misserable she is and how much of a struggle every day is. What struggle? what missery? Im the one with out my son, im the one going through all of the legal stuff because of her lies, im the one who spent 4 days in jail and lost his job because of her, im the one spending christmas by myself, she is the one who can stop me being on this ankle thing. Iv done so much for shannon its unreal to comprehend. I keep on thinking about the night back from jacksonville, and times at the beach and everything we have done and me working 3 weeks in mississippi cutting down trees just to get her a ring. I had a chance today from my public defender to counter prossicute shannon for DV. But i said no i dont want her going through what i did and eric being with out a mom for awhile.&nbsp;If it wasnt for my friends right now with how down and depressed iam i would probably be in hospital right now. I wake up every day sad and wishing would it could be. Every day is a struggle for <strong><u>ME</u></strong> . I keep telling myself it wasnt a waste, who knows what will happen in the future after all of this is done with. But its really hard to beleive. Even though she has done this to me, and keeping my son from me, i still love her just has much as i always have. I would give nething to talk to her. I miss her and eric every day. Its like half of me is missing because i lived for shannon and eric for so long. i dont know what to do...........</p>"

i really can't believe it.
what's the worst that could happen in court then?
that's so cheeky getting a restraining order because you can't even go and knock her out hehe.
don't say she's ruined your life, i know it's going to be hard to forget about her since she has had your child and all but hopefully once you get to England everything will get back on track and things will work out.
i'm really sorry to hear all that, you don't deserve what she's done!

"event","<p><strong><em><font size=""4"">Dont know what to do, been fucked over so bad, fed up with the lies and everything, 7 times my ass. slap? thats bs. i feel lost and lonely, lost my job bc of it, lost my son, cried today bc i miss him, cant go no where bc of this stupid thing on my ankle that i shouldnt be wearing. lost it all that i lived for, and lost everything. was love worth it all? im not sure, is the love still there? yes in my heart it is and will be for a long time, dont know about the other persons heart. wish i could just go back to the hurricane when it was all happy, and pure. I got to be strong and get up, but i dont think i can, iv never felt soo much pain inside of me, never felt like i have nothing to live for. i miss my son sooo much, i miss the other thing i had to, wonder if im missed to? i keep telling myself to be strong and get through it, but i dont think i can, i just want to go back in time and change things to what they were like b4. crying myself to sleep at night is the best i can do right now. maybe down the road things will better, in the future, after everything&nbsp;is blown off. i know one thing iv changed, 4 nights in prison changes you very quickly, prison is not where i should of been im not a criminal or a bad person. i never once called the cops for when she&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;me. so when&nbsp;&nbsp;i just try to stop arguing and getting slapped i get the bad side of it all. i just dont know what to do..........i need help.......i need her and him. even though everyone around me says i dont chad, trey, mum, sister, kelli, lizzi, everett, johnathon, tina, chuck, mike, taylor, steen and more&nbsp;but i dont lsiten, i listen to my heart.....</font></em></strong></p>"

call I'm desperate for your voice 
I'm listening to the song we used to sing 
In the car, do you remember 
Butterfly, Early Summer 
It's playing on repeat, Just like when we would meet 

I was born to tell you I love you 
and I am torn to do what I have to, to make you mine 
Stay with me tonight 

Stripped and pollished, I am new, I am fresh 
I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh 
Because every breath that you will take 
while you are sitting next to me 
will bring life into my deepest hopes, What's your fantasy? 

I was born to tell you I love you 
and I am torn to do what I have to, to make you mine 
Stay with me tonight 

And I'm tired of being all alone, and this solitary moment makes me want to come back home

Work was gay as hell, Danny the manager was working tonight and he wouldnt let me leave till i did all of his lil bitch work, i was close to quiting but then i thought about Shannon and the baby and that changed my mind str8 away lol. Shannon has been sick for the past 2 days , sux i hate seeing her like that i wish i cud do something to help her. Im going to go wash her car for her tomorrow,bring her flowers and make her chicken noodle soup. Hope that will make her smile. We havent really spent that much time with eachother latley, sucks, it feels weird because i love spending time with her and we have seen eachother every day since we have been 2gether (6 and a half months) but latley we havent and what she said to me the other night when it actually showed cuz i was down, hurt me. Its hard but cuz we havent spent much time together in the past week or two, it got me down and put bad thoughts into my head that she might be cheating on me or something, but she tells me over and over again she wud never do that to me and swore on our babies life, so that kinda convinced me that the thoughts were there cuz i missed her lol. Lately its been hitting me soo hard how much i love Shannon and would do anything for her. My dad and mom and sis might be moving back to england sooner or later (70% chance) so ill be staying here with shannon all by myself without my family, so ill be choosing to stay here and might loose my citizenship with england. But i hope one day that Shannon will move with me over there when her gram is no longer here. Who knows. All i know is that i just want to make her happy as i can and i love her with all of my heart and would do nething for her! I get my new motorcycle end of feb! and i transfer to Bone Fish&nbsp; Feb 2nd! PJC is aight&nbsp; i graduate in may =) .</FONT></EM></P>

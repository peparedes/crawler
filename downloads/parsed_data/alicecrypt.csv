"event","I find it more difficult to write about anything if I'm using my phone instead of a pen and a piece of paper. Even trying to type something sometimes effects the way I'm able to write about something and describe it. I just feel like I want to write all the time though, even if no one is reading or no one cares. For me writing is a way of just getting something out or describing an object or interest one has, and doesn't necessarily need to interest other people (though I think if it does, it's a plus!). I've almost had all of my half an hour lunch break, and I don't feel like I've done very much! Oh well. By the time I go back I will be finishing in less than an hour anyway woop woop!

"event","Last night was AWESOME!! Birmingham's clubbing scene is LUSH! Xian, Dean, Ian, Dave (last two are Dean's house mates) and another guy who I *think* was called is called Stuart went on a 'Homophobia is gay' club crawl and I met a ton of cool people! They were all really nice! The first three bars were pretty average but an experience by themselves (one was a lesbian bar). We got a few free shots in a couple of the clubs, and I had a couple of Jack and Cokes but the real fun didn't start until we got to the best and last club called 'The Nightingale'. Our time here was shared between dancing and being out in the beer garden or ""smoker's area"". It was so bloody cold outside so I was doing my best penguin impression (i.e. arms in shirt). I did borrow a HUGE jacket off some really tall guy called Owen but he went home after the third bar :( BUT ANYWAY! We went upstairs in the Nightgale and (omg!) there was a transvestite up on stage! Before then, I'd never seen a transvestite properly before! We all walked up to the stage and joined the crowd of people standing around watching, and Dean got picked to go up on stage! He didn't want to go up, but he did, and the transvestite did this game where they asked for certain items of clothing, and if Dean got these items, he'd get a free drink. The only items I remember being thrown at him is Xian's bra (at superhuman speed and the transvestite ended up wearing it) and a FULLY NAKED BLOKE (who got naked equally as quick) holding his bits. If I remember rightly they both got a drink, the other guy I think just for the fact that he got naked quickly and jumped up. The transvestite tried to get him to show the crowd his bits, but he was like ""No! I've got SOME dignity!"". I was very happy he didn't! After that (or before..) Xian and Naked Guy got up on stage and took part in this game where they had to go through this wicker basket and put on as many clothes as possible. Xian basically through them on but Naked Guy actually put them on properly. The winner depended on how many cheers they got, and because Naked Guy was on his own and Xian had all of us with her, she got more cheers (and rightfully so of course ;) ). After that we all went downstairs and carried on dancing, I bought a couple more drinks and then we decided to go ""in three songs time"" and annoyingly, the first of the last two songs were crap, but it was ok so we went out to the beer garden again and then we left and got a taxi home ^.^ As usual, I had no change so everyone had to give their change to me and I gave Ian a tenner, and we got home and I ate some noodles and we all sat down and chatted and I took a picture of Mousey on my VK bottle (which I'd smuggled out the club :P Then we all went to bed and collapsed and I fell asleep with the television on ;) MORE UPDATE TOMORROW


 Awesome dancing, cheap drinks and a great atmosphere!

I totally regretted the milkshake half way through drinking it though.. my whole body felt like I'd been rolled round in a giant ball :S ..because the problem is, I like to pretend that I'm not allergic to milk, but each time I try to pretend the end result is worse and worse! Oh well. I think the reaction I had really drummed it into me how I really shouldn't risk it. A little bit in some tea is good but not much else. It might make me only a little bit ill occasionally, but what the hell is going on within my body to have that reaction? That's what I'm worried about :S

I always go to the Sweet Talk Cafe on a Wednesday for chips 'n' tea to reward myself for getting coursework in on time. It's my own little reward system ^.^ and an excuse to eat chips!!! It's a good little place, and I love going there :) I actually think the name has changed to something like.. Ruby's Diner or something.. but I still refer to it as Sweet Talk ;) It's got new ownership and all that, so I understand the name change :)

"event","So I stayed up really late last night drinking with Xian, watching Black Books and eating Peperami's (sp?). Totally awesome night. Chilling out, relaxing and having a good laugh is something I believe should be a mandatory part of everyone's day. However, often it is when we are stressed, depressed and being unable to remember the last time we laughed that anyone can be bothered to get off their arse and make a difference. To realise their dreams and potential instead of just accepting whatever happens to them. It shocks me how many people there actually seems to be that just aren't taking advantage of this amazing gift called life. Often I meet or hear about people that cause me to make a statement such as 'people like that should be sterilised at birth'. But then it just makes me sad. Instead of sterilisation these people just need guidance."

Really though, nowadays, that doesn't really matter :P The age of consent for doing a lot of things has slowly been lowering for years. I think the only actual bonus of being 21 is the psychological effect. You just feel more.. not mature.. but more.. ready for things and up for things :D I think I feel like there's some invisible respect there because I'm not really that much of a kid anymore (in theory! :P). So I'm planning to spend this year doing three things. Going to gigs (both musical and comical), traveling (as much as a student can! ;p) and losing weight. I've listed those three in order of importance/success rate (at least I hope so!). I really want to get involved in music and start seeing more gigs this year, and I haven't been away enough and it's starting to get to me and as for losing weight, I haven't really got that much to lose, really, so I think that one will happily go along while I'm doing the other two :) I hope!

I'm round Kane's, just about to watch more of &quot;True Blood&quot; which is a new AMAZING sit com that started off in the US and made its way over to the UK (thank god!). True Blood &quot;details the co-existence of vampires and humans in Bon Temps (meaning &quot;good time&quot; in French), a fictional small Louisiana town. The series centers on Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepathic waitress at a bar, who falls in love with vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer)&quot; (taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood). 

That's what it's basically about, but I THOROUGHLY recommend anyone who's into vampires, romance, action, gore, hot guys and girls and quite a few scenes of nakedness to WATCH THIS SHOW. 

Just like I'm about to right now :D

It's a company that enables people to create books containing whatever information they like, from their personal blogs and diaries to information to do with their businesses and interests, for as little as $12.95 soft cover book, plus $8.95 for economy shipping to the UK. I mention this because in my last post, I said I was interested in maybe some day simply printing out old blog entries and placing them into a book or something, but I like the idea of making a proper book! Anyway, gotta rush off, Kane's gotta go to work :(<br /><br /><img src=""file:///C:/Users/webbz/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg"" alt="""" /><img src=""file:///C:/Users/webbz/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-1.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />"

"event","SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HEY long time no update! I've been thinking lately that it would be nice to regularly update this thing, just so that when I'm old and senile I'll have something to read so I know what I did lol. I won't just keep it all stored on here though; I think I'll probably print out my entries ever so often and stick them in a scrap book or something, along with some pictures. Sound like a good idea? Yeah, I like that idea. Beautiful. Oh my god I just rushed out of Kane's room, into the hallway, to come face to face with a naked Jordan with a bubble on his cock and a half naked Loz. Riiiight nice. ANYWAY!

Well, I don't think I can beat the above by writing anything else. So BYE!"

"event","OK so my results for yesterday were:

0/2 for food (mega huge coffee at Cafe Nero, then fried chicken and a burger for tea)
2/2 for water 
0/2 for exercise (I was doing work all day and just totally forgot)
2/2 for work (almost completely finished two pieces of work)
2/2 for daily self esteem (Saw my boyfriend and we had a fun time in Fareham together, and finishing the work made me feel gooood!)

I did OK but lately I've been slipping on the food front, and this isn't good. I just can't seem to say no (to people offering me stuff) and it's baaaaaaddddd. I'm just about to wii fit myself and see the damage :("

I think the problem has been that because I''ve not been updating, I haven't been having to face the results every day, and I've not been losing the motivation, but as it got longer and longer since I updated last, I kept track, but it became blurry and allowed myself to eat bad things &quot;because I could two bad things a day&quot; NO RACHAEL!! You're not ALLOWED!! It's just there as a &quot;just in case&quot; like someone surprising you with fruit and nut chocolate, or with tangy coke bottles! Nothing else! *smacks self* 

Anyway! I gotta run to college now (no, not literally, I'm not being THAT healthy :P lol!)"

"event","So I've been searching the diet communities and such on livejournal, for some &quot;thinspiration&quot; and some dieting ideas (some of them bordering on craziness!) and I've found a community called &quot;28dayplan&quot;. It basically goes like this:<br /><br />&quot; You can get up to a maximum of 10 points per day, 2 points for each of five categories. The five categories are: <br /><br />Food<br />Water<br />Exercise<br />Journaling/Posting<br />Daily Self Esteem Challenge<br /><br />Food <br />You must follow your meal plan or stay within your calorie range everyday! If you stay on your plan and eat within your daily range of calories give yourself 2 points. If you go over, but not by much, 1 point. If you have a bad day 0 points. <br /><br />Water: <br />If you have 3 pints, you get 2 points. 1.5 pints is 1 point, and less is 0. Any decaffeinnated beverage with 0 calories counts as water, but you can only use stuff other than actual water (diet coke, decaf black tea) for 1.5 pints of your daily total. Just think of how great your skin is going to look after ALL that water.. no more pimples..no more zits..<br /><br /><br />Exercise: <br />If you work out for 30 minutes or more, 2 points. 20-29 minutes, 1 point. Less than 20 minutes, 0 points. It's unrealistic to expect us to work out every day, so you get a &quot;Get out of exercise free&quot; card to use once a week.<br /><br /><br />Post: <br />This one's an all-or-nothing. You have to post every day about how you did on the challenge. If you do it, you get 2 points, if not, you don't get any.<br /><br /><br />Self Esteem Challenge: <br />This is where it gets fun. Every day of the week, there's a special daily challenge that you get to select. If you do it, you get 2 points, if you don't do one, you get 0. Challenge points are the only points that you can make up later, though.<br /><br /><br />--Monday Challenge: Celebrate Me! Give yourself a facial, take a bubble bath, get a few minutes to yourself, etc. Do something to make yourself feel good.<br /><br />--Tuesday Challenge: Procrastinator's Anonymous: Everyone has something they're putting off--this is your chance to finally DO it.<br /><br />--Wednesday Challenge: Random Act of Kindness Day. Commit a random act of kindness--give a compliment, be polite to a telemarketer, donate to charity--anything as long as it's nice!<br /><br />--Thursday Challenge: Try It, You'll Like it! Do a new exercise, make a new recipe that looks good--expand your horizons!<br /><br />--Friday Challenge: Fun Day! Blow bubbles, go to a movie, dance, be silly, have fun!<br /><br />--Saturday Challenge: Cleaning out the Cobwebs: Clean something in your house that needs it.<br /><br />--Sunday Challenge: This is a make-up day for all your other challenge days. If you missed a challenge, do it on Sunday. If not, just plan for the next week and take it easy.<br /><br />If you eat a little extra food, you can exercise extra to make up for the food points. 30 minutes for every 150 calories. You have to decide if it's worth it.<br /><br />In your daily post, make sure you post your numbers. Your first number is the number of days you've been in the challenge, the second is the pounds you've lost and the third is the total number of points you've earned on the challenge so far. So if you've been on the plan for 7 days, you've lost 1.5 pounds and you have gotten 68 points, you'd just post 7/1.5/68. Also, tell us about your daily self esteem challenge.. let us know how you loved yourself today! <br /><br />Safety Clause::::THIS IS SERIOUS<br /><br />The Day(s) of Amnesty..If you are having a bad day..weak..tired..getting ill.. STOP take the day off.. Eat &quot;normally&quot; and get yourself together. You get 10 points for recognizing your body's signals.. If you don't feel good about taking 10 points for being sick..remember that SUNDAY is make up day! :)) We wanna keep this safe. &quot;<br /><br />(Taken from http://community.livejournal.com/28dayplan/profile) <br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />As you've probably guessed, it's from an eating disorder community, but I thought the plan was genius and a good way to keep motivated. I had to change a couple of things to make it understandable to me, as it was from an American site and things were in ounces and whatever which I don't get lol.<br /><br /> I've decided to take the plan but change it a little bit. I've decided that I'm going to eat only healthy food (so no cakes, crisps, biscuits, coffee, anything like that) but if I have one &quot;bad&quot; thing, it'll take away a point, and if I have two bad things, I'll get 0 points. <br /><br />I'm going to drink 3 pints of water, and do the points exactly how it's set out above.<br /><br />As for the exercising, I'm either going to do 100 girly sit ups (so only up half way), 100 weird leg lift things, 100 girly push ups (balancing on my knees instead of my toes) and 100 wii-style hula hoop exercises (50 round one way, 50 around the other) <strong>OR</strong> 30 minutes on WII Fit and get 2 points. If I do 50 of any exercises, or 20 minutes on the wii, I get 1 point and anything beneath that I get 0. <br /><br />The journaling/posting option, as I'm not a member of the community, I've decided to change to homework and posting my points on my calender. If I do the amount of words I set out to do, I get two points. If I do half, I get 1 point and if I do less, I get 0. <br /><br />If I get all 10 points every day, my prize will be weight loss (hopefully!) but if I get less than 5, my punishment will be an early bed time, no going out and no seeing my boyfriend! So, if I plan to go out one night, I have to make sure I'm really good that day (well, up until I go out that is :P hehe!)<br /><br />As for the self esteem challenges, well going out in general, and seeing my boyfriend will make me feel good :) but I'm tempted to follow a couple of them, such as the procrastinator one ;) I NEED TO FINISH MY ROOM! lol :P <br /><br />What do people think of this? If anyone reads this post, I'd love to hear your views on the plan lol ;) I'll update regularly because I'm determined to make this plan work! It seems like quite a crazy one, but I'm determined to prove it'll work :P<br /><br />Peace out!<br /><br />P.S - well done on your diet so far Katie! I hope I have your self-discipline! Where do you get those meal plans from? They sound really cool!<br /><br />"

I went round a friend's house, planned to get drunk and have a wild friendly night, but was so tired I just couldn't be bothered. I tried keeping awake by going on the internet (I took my laptop to her house, mainly to charge my phone via USB while I wait for my charger to be delivered on Thursday - it broke!) but it just wouldn't bloody connect. At alllll. So in the end I gave up and came home. So here I am. Totally utterly dead. <br /><br />Peace out, and sweet dreams. <br /></span><br />"

My awesome teacher Lorraine managed to get us free entrance up the tower which was totally cool :) but before we went up the tower, we had an hour break in which me and a couple other girls in my class went to Burger King, and on the way to Burger King I had some strawberries on a skewer covered in melted belgian chocolate. LUSH! After our break my class took part in a talk on customer service and I found the whole thing really interesting, especially because there was a guy sitting in the corner that looked like Jet Lee! After that my class took part in a mystery shopper exercise and tested the Spinnaker Tower staff on their customer service skills by asking them questions about hiring out the tower, discounts for students and also buying souvenirs from the gift shop. It costs about &pound;800+ to hire out the entire tower for one night during the week, and about &pound;1200 on a Friday or Saturday night! Unbelievable!</span></span></strong><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Until next time!<br /><br /></strong></span><br /><br /></span><br />"

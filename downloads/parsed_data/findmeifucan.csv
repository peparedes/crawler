"event","he lives his life under a blanket of stereotypes and ego. how into oneself can a human be? it is almost overwhelmingly disgusting. life is not about statistics and probablility. it is not about calculation or accomplishments. it is about waking up each fucking morning going out into the world...and living, breathing, conversing. being human is what life is all about. many people do not grasp this concept and i have great pity for them. PITY i say. fucking disgrace."

But that's what I am right now. Totally and utterly <i>mellow</i>.

I had lots of things I had wanted to write about, and still do want to write about, but I simply can't without having at least an inkling of passion/fired-up-ness. Ah well. There's always time...and time...and time. That's all there is really. Time forever.

Everything suddenly seems beautiful and natural and right and <i>good</i>. But beautiful above all else.

And I'm perfectly content to sit here, sing with my music, and feel the way my chest moves when I breathe.  It just seems so incredible...sharp jerk when I need air badly, hardly any motion with my small frequent breaths, all in time to the music... I can feel my heart beating. Beauty alive."

"event","Slept for one hour before Gym Day, maybe wasn't the best idea, but sure as hell was fun. I was on a no-sleep high until about the middle of the homily...and then my body just crashed. I couldn't stop yawning, and I could barely keep my eyes open. The priest's speech didn't help with that either. Oh well.

Gym Day was...eh. I felt like our cheering was so bad and our hand motions weren't together at all. I was getting ticked off at the sophomores for that cheer they kept doing when they were just supposed to scream and at the other grades for screaming when they were supposed to wait their turn. The student relay game things were super funny though, so yay. I was worried about the song for the seniors, but that actually went pretty well.

We tied spirit with the sophs (what the heck?!?! seniors were so much better than us, and everyone was better than the sophs) and won student games and best mascot (yay Ashley!! well deserved).

This is the biggest wtf moment:
The <b>freshmen</b> won Spirit Day. I've never seen the entire grade be so shocked and pissed before. I still just...GAH. I don't get it. To put it in the words of a friend: ""So next year, we're just not going to jump at all, and we'll throw water bottles at <b>all</b> the other grades, and then we'll be SURE to win. Because, apparently, water bottles are golden."" I wanted to win, but losing to the seniors wouldn't have been too bad. But the freshmen after what they did? Impossible.

So then I went home and decided to take a nap at 2:30PM. PM, mind. Definitely didn't wake up until 8:30 the next morning. That's 18 hours. Oops."

It was just blacktop parking area. There was absolutely nothing where the building should have been. NOTHING. And that nothingness was worse than anything they could have put there to replace it.

I could handle the abandoned look. The windows were still boarded, but I just figured the people who ran it weren't back yet. But the whole thing effing vanished. I can't handle that.

They had the best snowballs out of all the snowball stands. I'm not kidding.

That's where...that's where Skottie and I got snowballs nearly every day after track freshmen year. Those car rides were some of the best ever. But the snowball stand is gone. I haven't seen Stepha since August 27th.

You know what else? During that long distance run on Aug 27th, I craved a snowball the whole way. I was going to get one right after practice. They were boarded up already. I was slightly upset, but I <b><i>knew</b></i> I'd get one in a few days after the hurricane had passed.

Head hurts again (obviously)... I honest to God think it's from physics this time. That class boggles my mind. I love how he's drawing on the board and we're just laughing because we don't know wth he's talking about. Rawk. By some miracle I didn't fail our first test - I was so excited. Then he says that the tests will be harder. Are you freaking kidding me? That was singlehandedly the hardest test evar, well in recent history anyway. Beller's midterm last year suxxored too. I miss her.

My face isn't red from windburn anymore, w00t. I'm sure it'll be red again tomorrow though. Yay for being the only idiots on the levee with 2958294204 mph winds and -2000 degrees. Meh, I exaggerate. Seriously though, it's actually quite a hoot and quite fun in its own masochistic way. Running sideways and going straight is a rather interesting experience. I suggest you try it.

In other news:
1) I badly badly need a hair chop.
2) My feet are too big...they didn't have my size shoe at Phidippides.
3) BOYS CONTINUE TO COMPLICATE LIFE
4) I have become a total ditz/spaz in the last few months. I blame this on the hurricane. Because, ya kno, repeatedly locking your car door BEFORE you try to get out of it is the cool thing to do. Oh yeah and because square root of nine definitely doesn't simplify into a little thing called THREE.
5) I open MREs just to get the candy/sweets out. Shh, don't tell.
6) And I quote my carpoolings ""No, leave the Wicked cd on! We wanna hear it."" in response to me releasing control of the music arena. Booyah, converts.

Then I get my butt kicked on the run. Nay. Served back to myself on a platter.

So then we leave to go home...aaaannndddd.... Wake me up when September ends is playing again! So I got annoyed again. So I put Wicked back on. So then I got re-happy. Both of the kiddos liked For Good - we even drove an extra piece to finish the song, hehe.

"event","Mmm...just got home a little while ago. Milo's back! Our kitties are still in Sulphur, LA, but they are fine and dandy. :D

My mom fell asleep in the car as soon as we got on the interstate, and when she woke up later, she ""wanted to stop when we got to Baton Rouge to use the bathroom."" We were only 15 miles away from Lafayette at that point, haha.

After we got to my grandma's apartment, she made us lay down to ""rest for a minute."" Bad idea. I slept for 3 hours. Whoops. It was an odd sleep though...like when you have fever and your dreams are really random and stuff. One of my dreams was that I was in my living room on one couch, and the cats were on the other couch. I woke up... and I was actually sitting up and making the 'c'mere kitty' noise. 

Have I ever mentioned how much I absolutely adore driving on the interstate at night? It's absolutely wonderful. That and riding in a plane at night. Two of the best feelings ever. ::is content:: And I was only going over 90 once, mmkay?

Final thought: As much as the two words sound alike, interstate and internet are very different things and CANNOT be used interchangeably. While it might sound okay to say ""There was so much traffic on the internet today,"" saying ""Yeah, I was driving on the internet, and there was this car, and..."" simply does not work. 

And yes, I do know this from first-hand experience. I am officially a loser. :)"

"event","So after semi-abandoning my journal, I'm bored and back. Hopefully for a while this time.

Today's high point was the trip to Walgreens to fill a prescription for my mom. There was a lady in line in front of me who was, quite frantically, demanding her Prozac. She didn't want her regular 20mg pills - she wanted the good ones, the 40mg set. The pharmacist tried to tell her that he couldn't just change her prescription, but the lady insisted that she really needed it. Her sister had to drag her away from the counter. 

So yeah, I had a pretty slow day. It was kind of nice, though, since everything's been so hectic lately. I'd rather not think of how many miles we've driven, how many times we've relocated, how many different school registrations I've been to... but I decided yesterday that this hurricane mess - terrible disaster though it was - has not been that bad to me. Our house was spared, my family is safe, my dog is safe, my cats...may be safe; and I've even changed a little bit for the better, I think anyway. Thank God for all He's done for us.

+As cheesy as it sounds, I've learned that possession things really aren't important. I didn't have much for a while (and didn't know if the things I had at home were still there), and it was okay. Really. It didn't matter.
+I was able to reconnect with some of my friends that I had thought I lost...and remembered why I liked them in the first place, haha.
+I had a few dreams that, wow, told me a lot about myself, good and bad.
+I had a couple deep conversations that were certainly enlightening. I figured out a little bit more of who I am/was/want to be.
+I realized how much MCA does mean to me. That ""you don't miss it until it's gone"" cliche? True.
++++I wasn't scared of contacting people that I don't talk to much, but wish that I did. I just did it because knowing where they were and that they were okay was more important than a stupid fear. I'm glad I did. That's a really big step for me y'all! Be happy.

Leaving the house - Take 1 - 12:30PM: Ok, good job Lauren! You're on time, you're 2 minutes from your house, you have everything - oh crap, you forgot your $50 gift card. Oh well, it won't take long to go back and get it.

Leaving the house - Take 2 - 12:35PM: Awesome, you can still make it if you hurry a little bit. Besides, if you're a little late, you can just call Br- CALL! Phone. Where's my phone? I need it to call Britt when I get there. Ok, um, calm down. In your purse? No. Not there. In your MCA bag? No. Not there either. On the floor? Uh-oh. You're 10 minutes away from home, but you have to go back. #%#%#$%

At home - 12:45PM: Where is your phone??? It's no where! Absolutely no where! Call your mom. Ask if she's seen it. No, she doesn't know where it is. Well, at least call Britt and tell her you'll be late. What's her number? It's in your phone...oh yeah, but you don't <i>have</i> your phone! <b>Idiot.</b> Let's see. You learned it last night for 5 seconds to get from the computer to the phone. You can do it. 481... um... 481... it's all 4, 8, or 1... BINGO! You got it! Good job. Call, no answer? Ok, leave a voice mail. Now get back in your car! 

Leaving the house - Take 3 - 12:50PM: You do realize you have to be there in 10 minutes, and this is a 30 minute trip, right? Ok, just checking, gosh. No need to be so snippy about it. It's your own fault you're running so late, you know. So, uh, do you know how to get to Esplanade? Sure, you're going to figure it out as you go... Good luck with that.

I did figure it out though! And I got some really cute tops. ""Would you still be my friend if I wore this?"" Haha - that girl knows her stuff. Seriously. I, on the other hand, missed the fashion sense line when God was handing out talents. Oh well, it just means I have to run outfits by certain *ahem* friends before going anywhere important. But it's all good.

We also got matching $.50ish bracelets at the Christian store. Woo! And, oh wow, ready for this? They have <i>pop-up</i> children's Bibles <b>in Spanish</b>! It was so cool! I was utterly fascinated - too bad I don't know Spanish. For all everyone says about French being close to Spanish, I understand Spanish about as well as I understand German or Latin. 

They had some nifty looking CDs in there too. I want ""SuperChick!"" :P

To conclude a great day, we had a pleasant run in the trails. It really was pleasant - nice weather, good route, comfy pace. What more could a girl want?

EDITed to add: 5-7-9 is my new obsession. That store is flipping incredible. <3"

Simultaneously, my cat's hissing downstairs, and my grandmother's yelling in French at the dog (cursing at him, I'd imagine, even though she was the one who let him loose).

My mom wasn't feeling good, so I dutifully set about the task of trying to tackle him and bring him back where he can't get into trouble. Well, Milo ran into my bedroom, trash still in his mouth, and immediately began peeing on my rug that I adore oh-so-much. $*#@&@$@*@# <b>He knows better than to pee in the house!</b>

So, I grabbed him and started rushing him downstairs and outside. He didn't stop peeing while I was carrying him. So then I had a lovely yellow trail across my darling rug to clean. Le sigh.

We had a two-mile road race at practice, and I ran 14:2?, which was okay. My mile splits were pathetically amusing. 6:50/7:30. Nice and even, eh? Oh well. 

Some of the girls and I went to see ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" at 9:50. It was a good movie, chick-flick, yes, but hey, that's what we liked about it. <b>MINI SPOILER</b> There was this one part - a touching scene between a daughter of divorced parents when she's crying and spilling her guts to her dad about how she feels about their relationship and asking what she did wrong and generally letting all her pent-up emotions go. <b>/MINI SPOILER</b>

Everyone was quiet, touched, and feeling the girl's pain. I don't mind admitting that I teared up a little bit. I wish I could do what the girl did, but then I don't think it would affect anything. But that's neither here nor there.

I looked a couple seats down to catch a certain person's reaction, and oh <i>God</i>, I wished so much that I had been sitting next to her, just to squeeze her hand or whisper comforting words or something. Anything! I'd never seen her look so ashen-faced and I could practically see what she was thinking, and I just wanted to bethereforher. Say something, say anything, make it better, share her frustration, just be someone who understood. Just...do something to make it right, make it okay.

I don't think anyone else noticed (probably a good thing), and in a second, the scene ended, and it was gone. I wish she would talk to me about it. She'd be mad if I brought it up though. 

I hate it when this happens, and it's the second time it has struck me this hard. Second time I could honestly talk a thing out with someone because I've <i>been there</i> and I really know how it feels, not just one of those people who say they do. I HATE being younger. People don't want to go to a younger person for help - it makes them feel ashamed of themselves for looking down for guidance. But it shouldn't. Experiences don't pick people on a scale of age...they just happen.

"event","Yesterday started out as the worst day in summer so far, and I sincerely hope it doesn't get any worse than that. Because it was <b>craptastic</b>.

I was rushing around as usual, close to being late to the orthodontist. I had to leave within the next 5 minutes, or it was going to be ugly. I was on my way out the door when my grandma stops me and tells me that ""we need to talk."" I told her I didn't have time because I needed to leave right NOW. So then, she just tells me, ""Well, how are you going to get there?"" I stopped for a moment to goggle at her in confusion. ""The car broke down this morning, and it's in the parking lot at the library.""

*@#&$^@*&#$^ ""WHAT?""

This was not just any ortho appointment I was missing. It was one I had been on the waiting list for for two months, and I really needed for the Dr. to look at my retainer and make sure it wasn't screwing up my teeth. I refuse to wear braces again.

I huffed away from my grandmother, fully blaming the car incident on her even though it wasn't really her fault, and began furiously calling my mother. As usual, I couldn't get through. How could she do that to me when I really needed her? (Geez, I'm so self-centered.) She finally calls back, and I dumped all my stress on her - a decision which I instantly regretted. My poor mom had been having a horrid day at work also and practically started crying on the phone... so I did what I could. ""Well, it's not really that bad. I'll just call and cancel."" So I did that next.

Then my grandmother started freaking out on me with commands of ""go fix the phone."" Huh? The phone? I dutifully looked at the phones to see what her problem with them was. That became instantly obvious though - they were dead. Our phone line was gone, kaput. Then we had a yelling match about them - she ordering me to fix it, me bitching that there was nothing I could do to make the dial tone come back.

Enter Grandma into manic phase. Dear God, save me. She started tearing through the house and yelling about how the car guy couldn't get in touch with us because our phones wouldn't ring, and she didn't have his phone number to tell him this. She was going through papers like a wild woman and making a mess everywhere, meanwhile telling me to look stuff up in the phonebook that made no sense whatsoever. I was supposed to be looking up things like ""Texaco."" How a gas station was supposed to equal her repair person I didn't (and still don't) know. I did it anyway because I didn't feel like being yelled at, and I figured it was best just to go with it.

I started looking, realized it was useless, and also realized that I was very hungry. I dropped that duty to pursue the contents of the refridgerator. I was getting my lunch together when the dog started having a hissy fit, so I let him inside to calm him down, fully aware that I wouldn't be getting any eating done if I had to make sure he didn't rip apart the living room or swallow something bad for him. I could deal with that. Except that my grandma entered the scene again. She was still bustling through the house with no logical anything and went out the back for God-only-knows. Of course she left the door open. I think she does that to spite me. 

So, as everyone knows Milo does when doors are left open, he ran out of it.

I ran out right behind him, still holding my plate of lunch and just thankful that I actually had something besides a night shirt on this time. Milo is a nosy little bugger who does not come when called, even though he is fully aware that he is being called. I chased him all the way down the street, into the neighbor's private side yard, and halfway under the fence that eventually leads to the highway. I bribed him back to me by grudgingly offering him the meat part of my lunch - he fell for it. Then I had to drag the poor thing by the collar all the way back home; he made half-suffocating noises, and it made me feel really bad, but I couldn't let him go or else he would take off again.

I finally got him back into the house and immediately began screaming at my grandma about how she just almost let the dog get killed. I must be a horrible person because I <i>enjoyed</i> yelling at her. She, in turn, was yelling that the dog should know better. Yeah, right, because he is how old? Four months? Yeah, uh huh, he should know better... HE'S A BABY!

The phone rang. Awesome, the phones came back to life. But then my grandma said something that made my stomach drop in realization. My purse was in the car. My purse had 50 bucks in it. My purse is my purse, and there's no way someone was going to steal that. So, I did the next logical thing. I walked to the car to go get my purse back.

The walk was only about a half of a mile, but it was really hot, and I had to walk on the shoulder of Jefferson Highway and be extremely close to cars whizzing by at 45 to 50 mph. Those suckers are loud.

I arrived in one piece, retrieved my valuables, and took refuge in the library for 30 minutes or so. It was cool and quiet and <i>perfect</i>. But I knew that had to come to an end, as all good things do at some point, and walked back home before I had to deal with a certain someone freaking out about how sure she was that I had been murdered or gang raped. No lie.

The day went steadily downhill, with some outright leaps into further pits of crappiness along the way. I listened in on the conversations that involved the repair of the car and the money it would take to fix it, so I'd be able to report the facts to the Grand Pumba of the house, Mommy dearest. I felt truly sorry for the people on the other end dealing with my grandmother because she couldn't really understand them, and thus she used her specialty power over them of being-so-confused-that-she-can-confuse-people-who-originally-knew-what-they-were-talking-about. Oy vey.

I finally got it straight, briefed the madre, and then passed the thankfully-working-phone over to ma grandmere. The car's going to cost about $500-600 to fix and that's without towing. Towing could be anywhere from $34 to $60. I wish I had a job.

Later, I couldn't take it anymore, so I just was like ""screw it"" and went upstairs to play Spider Solitaire on the computer. I was here for about 10 minutes before I heard my grandma talking trash about me to the puppy. She has this really annoying habit of loudly talking to things that don't understand what she's saying (puppy, newspaper, herself) in order for the person she's talking about to get the message. Today she was informing Milo that ""Lauren doesn't love you. She only takes care of you when she wants to. You know Milo, me and you, we're a lot alike. We're both neglected. No one wants us."" Which is absolute bullshit. I love Milo, and I take care of him all freaking time because I do love him.

Everything that happened was worse than it sounds, and to cope with all this throughout the day, I'd been carrying around a can of vanilla icing and eating it by the fingerfulls. I need to find a healthier coping method.

EDIT: Oh, and joy, I started my period. -_-

EDIT 2: Even though it doesn't sound like it, I do love my grandma. Maybe deep down, true, but it's there. It's just times like these..."

"event","The pup was begging for a walk this morning, so I stumbled out of bed bleary-eyed, threw on some shorts from off the floor, grabbed his leash and took him. Half an hour into the walk and a good mile or so from home, he promptly pooped out on me, lay down, and refused to get up. So I sat down with him and chilled on the edge of the golf course for 10 minutes. At least he had picked a good spot - there were laborers across the street with some pretty good music playing. After spotting a squirrel, Milo took off after it, and we were rolling again.

Then I began my great Watermelon Adventure, though I didn't know the thing was going to give me so much trouble at that point. I had to go to not one, not two, but three stores to find a proper watermelon. The first two stores only had funky, mini, seedless watermelon that would barely feed two people. They were priced at 7 bucks a pop, no less. I think not. Worse than that, it was the first time Super WalMart had let me down. I felt severely disheartened - they're supposed to have everything!

So I had to call mother at work to get watermelon advice. She immediately told me something equal to 'not now, f00, there's an emergency in teh hospital!' To which I replied in a very whiny tone, I must say, ""But Mom, I'm having a <i>watermelon</i> emergency!""\ WalMart has failed me, and Winn Dixie doesn't have any either! What do I do?"" She advised me to go to Breaux Mart, which I don't think I'd ever been in before, but they whole-heartedly have my support now because they had big, honest-to-God watermelons. 

I went home, put it on ice, and then had the brilliant idea of bringing the whole kit and kaboodle inside because it was cooler in there. BIG mistake. Narrow doorways are devilish, and they put up a good fight. I think they won actually. I pulled an arm funny (either then or when I was putting my hair up, stupid hair) and my back hurt for a little bit, but it went away.

Finally it was time to get it all in the car and head out. I was set to leave a healthy 5 minutes early, and good thing too. I had the hardest time maneuvering that ice chest into the backseat, mainly due to the late discovery that there's a spout in the front from which the water can drain that is only covered by a flimsy stopper. As I was heaving it in the car, the flap flipped, and water started gushing out from the melted ice. Swearing, mostly mental but some verbal, commenced. Luckily, most of it flew out the car and not into the fabric on the seats, but then the stopper wouldn't go all the way back in the whole. Thankfully I hadn't cleaned out the car since school ended, and my MCA PE towel was still back there and was able to catch the remaining drip. With a final grunt, I got that baby in the car and settled. 

I'd never felt like such a weak little girl before, and it's not a feeling I want to repeat anytime soon.

On the way to City Park, I had to stop twice to check that the stopper hadn't come off again. Thankfully, traffic was lighter than it's been yet to date, so I still made it a little early, and was thus able to get an okay parking spot. I got the chest out of the car without popping the spout, and everything worked out. The watermelon had arrived without flooding my backseat. Mission accomplished.

Run was good. The watermelon could have tasted better for all the work it made me do, but it wasn't bad either. I'm going to sleep good tonight.

Peace out y'all.

Like a minefield or something, except worse because at least in a minefield, you can see the ground where the holes are. There isn't any ground in my poor habitat.

That task was not to be tackled today, however. I had to do something much, much worse. I had to... (dun, dun, dun) ...bring my grandmother shopping. Now, I don't like shopping by myself. Shopping with a superbeing who apparently doesn't need to breathe between words, sentences, or even paragraphs like the rest of us is damn near murderous. We didn't even buy anything after 3ish hours. Waste of time, much? Oh well. At least we started the furniture search - we need to hurry up and buy it, so I can assemble it (yay, power tools!) and have it ready for her move date. I'm trying not to show too much excitement in front of her because that would just be plain rude. (But...::shifty eyes:: SQUEE!!!) I love her dearly, but three generations of women in one house clearly do not mesh well together.

While we were out today, I had to freaking stop and pee at every. single. solitary. store. Sometimes twice. That's just not right. I need bladder pills or something because if I had it my way, I'd have immediate access to a potty every few yards. That would so be my Miss America answer to the infamous ""one wish"" question.

Later, I ran 5+ miles with the girls and sweated out my post-shopping anxiety and excess water molecules. All became right in the world again.

I feel like such a two-year-old right now. Rock on, Disney! Except you need to stop making sequels and crappy new movies. Get back to the greats, study them, and make good stuff again. You really went downhill after Mulan. But anyway.

Would anyone be up for a Disney-thon sleepover at some point? Embrace your inner child? ::uses tempting voice:: We could bake stuff... oh em gee, we could shape food into disney things! Like Mickey-head-shaped cookies! Ah!

"event","First entry, yay! Ahem. So...play by play of my day.

I woke up at 1 today, and I was still really tired. I should have known I needed more than 12 hours, mais c'est la vie. I did have an interesting dream though... it was based on a radio commercial. Go figure. It turned out that the ""true story"" that the jewelry company advertised was a fraud, and my accomplices and I got to take down the company in court. Oh, and at one point we were in MCA, and there were all these secret elevators and spiral stairs. They were actually very spiffy.

I ran errands all day and then had to rush off to Watermelon Club. Time really got away from me, but I made it to City Park a little early. Good thing because it gave me a chance to call my mother, who didn't yet know about my plan to go the movies right after running. As usual, she didn't answer her phone. Great.

The run was good, the strides were good, and the watermelon was good. The sky did not look good. I brought a friend home, toweled off some sweat and changed clothes in the car, and resumed rapid dialing to Mom. She finally answered and gave me her usual safety speech that I've come to know and love, bless her. Then I was off to Elmwood, realizing I was already late and still a half hour away. At least I'd told them I'd be late, right?

But then the rain came down. Hard.

Perfect...more delay. But, hey, at least my hair would be wet with rain water and not sweat droplets. Can't really complain about that. I finally arrived, found my buddies, got situated, and then realized that I was cold. Very cold. I'd forgotten to bring a spare bra, so the one I was wearing was sopping wet with sweat. And it was cold. And the air was blowing on me. And I was really cold. COLD, I tell you!

The movie kinda sucked; I think we saw Kicking and Screaming, or something. It wasn't a total waste, though, because I got to see everyone for the first time in almost two weeks.

Oh yeah, and I didn't get lost ONCE today, despite going many places I didn't think I knew how to get to. Take that, directionally-retarded brain! I will beat you yet! Muahaha. 

That is all.

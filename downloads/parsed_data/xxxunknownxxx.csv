"event","Internal Memo
From the Interim Director
For Immediate Dispersal:


It has been nearly five years since The Good Doctor suddenly disappeared while on special assignment.  His whereabouts are still unknown.  With his work still uncompleted, and with no contact with him or news of him, many believed him deceased.  The staff carried on with their treatments as best they could, but without The Good Doctor's research project leadership and inspiring presence, the advancement of both our theoretical model and our treatment regimen have stalled.  We continue forward as best as we are able, but he is sorely missed.

Today, as I entered his shuttered office searching for any notes or research materials that may assist us in refining and improving our treatment regimen, I discovered a note on his desk--in The Good Doctor's handwriting.  It was not present when we shuttered his office.  The rest of the scene was undisturbed.  No one in the senior staff or janitorial staff can account for when this note was placed on the desk, who may have put it there, or when it was written.  Any staff members with any knowledge whatsoever pertaining to this note are to report immediately to myself.  The note has been transcribed below.  It reads:


THE LITANY AGAINST DESPAIR

I shall not Despair.
Despair is the Spirit-Killer.
Despair is that clutching Death
that squanders all gifts.
Despair is an illusion
that narrows our vision
and obscures the Spirit.
Only through trickery
can it consume our power,
and only through our power
can it touch Reality.

Despair is not me.
It cannot touch my soul.
I shall purge and discard
all that it has touched.
I shall forget
every pernicious Lie
that it ever told.
I shall close my eyes completely,
rather than look where It points.
I shall breathe in the Holy Spirit.
I shall let it reclaim me.
Then, Despair shall return
to the Nothingness it came from.
And I shall see Truth again.

But an omen told me that we should touch again.

I've looked back at you from a distance, and learned much about myself.  There is still more to learn, I am sure.  You contain artistry.  Beautiful things.  Also, pain and sadness.  A special kind of madness.  This is what you were to be, from the beginning.  Revisiting now--hindsight brings insight.  You taste of a unique spice.

But there is weakness in you.  It was born into you, it was in your genetics.  I have departed from you for a while because I need to become something else.  To learn how to be different.  I am well on that road now, although not as far along as I would like.  My muscles grew, my flesh tightened, my resolve strengthened, my weakness shrank.  I smell weakness now.  I smell it seeping through the cracks between words.  I do not say this in denunciation, and I by no means renounce you, but understand.....


I must evolve again.


Perhaps you will remain a testament to what I was.

Or perhaps you will evolve with me.

I do not know the answer--time will tell.


I pray the weakness that preys is banished
May my body become hard as diamonds
May my mind become sharp as razors
May my spirit be as water
A rising tide that lifts
A crashing wave that sweeps away
A gentle rain, washing away despair
A mist that fills the empty spaces
A glacial mass, inevitable in its path
The fluid of Life, comprehending everything
Perfect in its many forms
And yet still One

The Good Doctor is once again on special assignment.  As a result, the annual report detailing the latest findings regarding the Great Pandemic is not as yet available to the general staff.  In lieu of the unfinished yearly report, The Good Doctor has issued an internal memo for immediate circulation, which touches upon his newest discoveries.  Any reports of possible cases are now to be handled by the relevant general staff, following the accepted procedures thus far developed by The Good Doctor's office. The memo is enclosed below.


Since the beginning of this project, we believed that Despair--the Sickness Unto Death was a positively-existing phenomenon...  something which had a substantial existence and an identifiable essence.  When we approached the noumenal boundaries of observation, however, the Sickness would suddenly appear hazy and indistinct.  In addition, a countervailing force seemed to arise in response to the Sickness.  This countervailing force would also eventually appear hazy and indistinct, suggesting that it also lacked the quality of substantiality.  In some of our patients, the Sickness would wane, an unusual countervailing force would appear, but the patient would relapse before very long.  In most of the patients who have appeared free and clear of the Sickness, this countervailing force has not been observed.  We first believed that this was a natural reaction to the Sickness--evidence of an existential immune system response.  But those in which this 'response' was greatest almost all relapsed in short order.  By contrast, the patients who we have considered 'cured' show little to no evidence of this response.  As of now, we are pursuing the Buddhist theory in attempts to account for these developments.  For those not yet briefed, the theory--as it applies to this matter--postulates that both the Sickness and this countervailing response are equal and opposite reactions, and part of a larger whole.  We have never understood where the Sickness comes from--it has been a mystery that perpetually indicates the incomplete state of our heuristic models.  The Buddhist theory may shed some light upon this issue, as it regards Despair and Hope as a concurrently-arising dichotomous twin-pairing.  A full model, followed by an empirical explanatory testing phase shall be forthcoming.

As always, personnel are reminded to not compromise their integrity in pursuit of research or administration of treatment.


This concludes the Doctor's memo. More information and further findings on The Great Pandemic a.k.a. Despair--The Sickness Unto Death will be forthcoming on a need-to-know basis.---The Management

The mysteries begin unraveling, other mysteries, laying long-dormant in the subconscious darkness, surface and present themselves as simple puzzles to be solved.  As the ignition proceeds, the flame catches hold, the misconceptions, guilts, and traumas of yesterday that gripped you in their deathly riptide vanish into an acrid smoke of sacrificial offering.  Their fumes linger in a wreath of shifting wisps about you, but their power is no more.  As the flames burn brighter, the center is able to become still.  A force pushes outward from the center.  The fog rapidly recedes under the illuminating blaze and the field of sentient sovereignty which creates its own space, its own order.  As the fog is burned away, your surroundings become clear.  The Matrix is laid bare.  Immediate understanding of what it is and how it works floods into your awareness.  In the very moment you first perceive it clearly, you perceive it as an illusion.  Disconnect.  So this is what freedom tastes like.  They no longer have dominion over you.  Freed from the illusions and from the neuroses which compelled and controlled, you are now your own, this space is now your own.  You have found yourself, your spirit, your mind, and your voice.

After the seller got the BoE, the buyer was relieved of his responsibility in commercial law.  The remedy for the seller was to negotiate the BoE for actual payment (substance).  Then, and only then, the debt would be extinguished.  Until that happened, the debt was merely 'discharged' from the person issuing the bill of exchange...

As part of the 'reorganization' the FRB allowed the government to continue operations with the bank's private script.  This printed script is loaned to its debtor at interest, creating a condition of perpetual bondage of the government.  Worse, rather than reveal the truth to the people, the government roped the people into the same ghastly scheme.  The government could have, and should have, been forthcoming with the horrific skulduggery it committed with the People's gold.  It was not.  The government blamed the people for 'hoarding' gold rather than reveal that it shipped out the gold it held in trust.  It concealed the truth from the people.  By confiscating (stealing) the gold (wealth) from the people, the government destroyed the American people's ability to pay debt, since there is no substance backing the notes.  The American people instantly became debtors.""

"event","What follows is probably the only important thing you are likely to see in relation to this issue:

""Let's say I lend a $100 note and that the $100 note carries a use fee of 10%.  And, let's say the single $100 note, gets passed around 100 times in the next year.  And each time it passes from one to another, 10% is charged to each who has used the $100 note.  I would then surely end up with a great return from the money I lent.  I get $10 one hundred times or $1000 return on my loan of $100.  And even better, the $100 is still out there generating more use fees.  The debt, which is the 10% I earn (that is payable to me) every time the $100 passes between people, is reproducing or multiplying exponentially.  Now you can see why usury was historically forbidden.  While one person might be able to repay, society as a whole cannot.  It is impossible because only the $100 note exists, and no extra notes were printed to pay the exponential interest that continues to build.  Even a low rate of interest creates a debt that cannot be repaid.  Usury is the perfect means to capture a population.  The one who creates a debt that cannot be repaid becomes the ruler of all who are in debt.""

"event","I recall seeing op-eds back in 2002, 2003 calling Chavez a 'conspiracy theorist' and any basic geopolitical analysis he put forth (usually nothing you couldn't find in a Chomsky book, or even a Foreign Affairs article!) was ridiculed as such.  Even a few years ago I'd see Matt Taibbi articles denounced and dismissed as 'conspiracy theories.'  The term means something like 'wild, heavily-biased speculation not backed by any truth.'  After delving into the 'conspiracy world,' I was always fascinated that most alternative media people and authors rarely used the word.  Soon, I understood why--because it's a largely meaningless term.  Almost none of its meaning comes from the denotative side, which just means 'a hypothesis which features multiple individuals and some measure of premeditation.'  Of course, almost everything people do involves multiple people mixing premeditated actions.  In this sense, you could logically conclude that 'Civilization is a conspiracy theory.'  The term delivers all of its mimetic payload in the connotative sense of the word.  It brings to mind an image of intelligent lunacy, informed confusion, and wild baseless speculation.  'Unsolved Mysteries' and 'X-Files' created a 'pop conspiracy' image involving aliens making cute crop circles and abducting random rednecks for unfathomable reasons.  The synonym of 'conspiracy theory' in the average uninformed person's head would be 'crazy-talk.'  It's a groupthink stigma of insanity.  I wish Foucault were around today to share his thoughts on these matters.  But almost nowhere in most discussion of conspiracy theory in blanket terms do you find any specific, real-world facts.  It's interesting how almost none of the people I discovered as real conspiracy theorists ever use the word, except in derision of people who are uninformed or naive.  Most of the time, they talk about facts--people, places, events.  They talk about real-world happenings, then reason from the facts to a hypothesis (often not even explicitly stated, because often a basic presentation of the facts will be damning enough) supported by those facts.  This isn't a universal pattern, as we've seen religious conspiracy theorists who start from prophecy and work from there.  But the discourse is largely about how the observed facts support a conclusion of conspiracy.

But again, if all of civilization is conspiracy and any thinking about it or analysis of it is theory, it still doesn't explain the pathological fear and avoidance that the mainstream shows towards anything smelling too much like 'conspiracy theory.'  How do we explain that?  It all comes down to mass mind-control and culture creation... the Matrix syndrome.  The real-world matrix is an alternate reality projection/deception, just like the movie.  But in the real world, it's not a computer program through some server that we're all jacked into.  It's done through propaganda and selective omission in a mimetic fashion to create a framework of understanding and belief/value system through which people will interpret the world.  In the real world, 'the Matrix' is inside your head, built by you, directed by viral propaganda ranging from the most intellectual article or discussion to basic bodily manipulation through art forms.  B.F. Skinner said that he could turn a child into anything if given complete control of their environment.  The cognitive psychologists who laugh at him today forget that the first and foremost environment of the human being is their own mind.  In a world filled with contradictory information and analysis, people tend to give up making sense of it all.  It results in this 'helplessness syndrome' talked about by Icke.  The hegemonic message is:  ""There is no figuring things out, and if you try to figure anything out, you will go cuckoo like the tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists.""  We should regard this widely disseminated implication as political fear-mongering trickery akin to the old assertion that marijuana turns you into a permanent schizophrenic.

So seeing what the term means for the average person, this brings us to the question, 'what is conspiracy theory to the conspiracy theorist?'  Simply put, in two words--alternative narrative.  A person who is very well-informed, knows things that most people do not know, and who recognizes propaganda in almost everything they see around them will understand that there is a range of narratives discussed in the 'mainstream.'  Other narratives, no matter how factually sound, are simply not seriously discussed.  The conspiracy theorist does not suffer under the assumption that whatever comes out of ABC News, NY Times, RAND Corp., the FDA, the NIS, or their textbooks is professionally vetted, objective truth.  In fact, he or she probably is aware of a long history of outright lies, lies by omission, and fabrication that characterizes any of these institutions.  Moreover, he or she will likely have a developed and informed understanding of the political economy of the U.S. to recognize massive conflicts of interest at almost every level of operation in these institutions.  Any police investigator looks for the who, what, where, when, why, and how.  They actively look for conspiracy, and solve crimes by doing so.  They look at patterns of action to read intent and motive.  What a conspiracy theorist does is hardly different from what a detective does.  If a detective calls an individual out on their bullshit story, it's called good police work.  When I call a corporation out on their bullshit story (Public Relations), it's called conspiracy theory.

'Conspiracy theory' to the conspiracy theorist is a cultural marker.  It means that the theorist has a fundamental separation from their fellow mainstream neighbors, that they have 'awakened' (to some degree at least) to the Matrix, that they look at corporate cultural product and see it as mimetic (often even subliminal physical) manipulation, not as truth.  The mainstream person looks at a television program and sees entertainment.  The conspiracy theorist sees mimetic, viral programming.  So in summary, 'conspiracy theory' is really any discussion, discourse, or narrative that differs with or debunks the 'official story,' which is usually a public relations firewall to preemptively deflect critical scrutiny.  Conspiracy theory is thinking outside of the box--in fact, stating that there is no box and that 'the box' is itself an illusion--developing your own analysis and conclusions rather than automatically accepting the hegemonic narrative.  Talking about 'conspiracy theory' means that we've moved the discussion to a meaningless and largely useless discussion on hypotheses-in-general rather than discussing a particular hypothesis and its lack or abundance of factual support.


In a time of universal public relations, telling the truth is conspiracy theory.

"event","""To summarize:  The Federal Reserve Bank is a private foreign corporation.  It took all of the gold of Americans and other persons in 1933, and not one US Citizen, inclusive of any and all domestic corporations, etc., was allowed to own gold.  Checking the websites for the Secretaries of State, one will not find any of the Federal Reserve Banks registered as a business or corporation within any of the States...  This is compelling evidence that it is a foreign corporation, in that it is not registered with a state to do business.  That is unlike every other form of domestic business, which must be registered with the individual state's Secretary of State.  We know that there is an exclusion for business filings for entities dealing in interstates commerce.  Hence, the activities of the bank (Federal Reserve Notes) must be empowered by the commerce clause of the Constitution.  The Federal Reserve Bank issues the world's most prominent reserve currency.  The FRB pays the US government to print those Federal Reserve Notes.  It marks each with a serial number.  Serial numbers deal with products.

Conclusion:  Federal Reserve Notes are products of the foreign Federal Reserve Bank used to transact interstate and foreign commerce.
So now we have evidence in law that these notes are private property of the FRB.....

...we now see that the FRN is a contract, a written promise to pay a certain sum of money.  A common term for this is an IOU.  In all financial documents, the lender, which is the creditor, is at the top.  The debtor is second.  Look at the FRN in your possession.  Who is the creditor at the top?  The bank!  The debtor is the United States of America...  This obligation is signed (executed) by 2 officers of the United States, as any debt note is signed...

Conclusion from the preceding few paragraphs?  The Federal Reserve Note is actual property belonging to the Federal Reserve Bank.  It is evidence of the obligation of the United States of America to the bank.  It is a note of debt.  It must be ultimately returned to the bank to satisfy the obligation of the USA unless the bank is keeping it in circulation to gather perpetual interest.""

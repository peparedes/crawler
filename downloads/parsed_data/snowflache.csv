You are a powerful character.
You tend to be possessive and lusty - which explains your greedy nature.
You feel threatened when people try to order you around or control you.
You are prone to suspicion and jealousy - but your resilience and passion get you what you want.

To all my friends out there that i havnt seen or heard from in AGES! 
before we start i just want to say that i miss a whole lot of you.


I have been extreamly busy. which is an awesome chnage for me. 
<i>(instead of being stuck at home with nothing to do and stuff)</i>
I've been working hard. Ive got a new job at a company called UCMS
they do phone stuff for Telstra. Its slightl better than my last job.
in where the building is better, the view of southbank is AWESOME!
much beter than staring at a wall. hehe. 

Ive been DJ'in more and more. Aside form runing my night.. which is 
well slowly picking up, it <b>IS</b> a hard job. The flyers are and have been done
they look SHIT HOT! We have a great bunch of DJ's playing. Its just the advertising
side of things is a bit of a slut, Ive got 2 people who can start promoting for us.
professional promoters who i hope will do a good job. Both female, as you know... male 
promoters are all about sex drugs and rock n roll. which is GREAT, but not good 
if you want shit done. i know im male and i LOVE my party. i love it so much not to 
give a shit on how its run to get people there :P *giggle*

Ive also been playing gigs at this lil sunday recovery in the city at this place called WORD.
tis just down the lane from the old psyconaut, cute lil place with a great summer coutyard, tis funny its managed by a girl who i met when i was 20, SPIN OUT?! <b>YOU BET</b>

Also going to play a gig at billboards in the city... that right my old haunt on a thursday night when Terriyaki was in full swing. now its been cheesed up, not the most ultimate gig.. but for now
a gig is a gig, and if im not being asked to perform oral favor im happy :P
Because unlike regugitator, im NOT going to suck alot of dick to get where i wanna be. hehe

<i> though working for telstra is sucking enough dick :p hehe </i>

Ive also started seeing this girl called Claire, which is putting a dumb look on my face most of the day. She is an awesome chick who is quiet intelligent. Which is a strong point due to the fact she is 18. thats right, i AM the hand that is rocking the cradle :P Though she is HAWT! so thats ok
<i> a kiss for all you haters</i> Haha! does that mean i can use the phrase, i keep older but they stay the same age. hehe, im lame. But is is away in Byron Bar at the moment...cant wait for her to get back. I met her on my birthday weekend. So, yes. i had an awesome weekend to say the least. 

So thats been the life of luke. needless to say its been pretty good... rushed as hell. havne'nt 
had too much time to scratch my nuts. but that might be  good thing :P 
why am i talking about my nuts? probably cause im at work and want something extra to do. 

we, all should do something soon.... there as been a big hole where you lot once were.
how has everyone been, hit me up for a hello and a smile

its been a lil over too long since ive made a real post, so here goes.

Whats been happening... been working at a place in the city, sucking cock for 
the man and doing internet tech support for telstra. Yep. It has been an OK job
but now is time for me to find a new one... getting kinda over this place...

Ive also met a fantastic girl.... were not together... but we have spent the last, 2weeks or just
more in each others company everyday bar one or 2. have talked everyday since initially hanging with
each other... and all we do is laugh and have a really good time. Whre is this heading? i dont know
do i care? posssibly.... it makes me nervous but extreamly happy at the same time.....
ce la vi

so all in all im doing pretty good... its shakey ground now... but thats the thrill
will be back on solid ground and hopefully after a week or so. ill be back on a high platform.
earning more money and in another relationship.

You slightly open the door. 
you feel the sun warm the tip of your nose 
you feel the cool breeze across your cheek 
you smell lifes enticing scent 
You want more, you want it all 
You fling the door open and run outside 
letting all of whats beyond your unlocked 
unopened door fill every gap around you 
and with in you.... its beautiful 
Though it will eventally get dark 
And you will eventually have to come inside. 
And all you want to do is to stay outside. 
In the sun, being touched by the breeze, 
being tempted my its aroma. 
But its not ment to last. 
You have to wait for tommorow. 
But the door stays open. It can never be shut 
And staring out at the night 
listening to the promises the stars make 
it will be day again soon 
Where out the windows 
and though the door 
to the other side 
is her."

I was in a house which was an old style house.
And there was an old gas oven in the lounge room where after a dinner of fish and chips with the family,
i awake and slide out the tray and take a shit on it. Then get told in a separate incident by my mother that
i have only 7 years to live because of a condition that ive had for a year but dont know about it. Which 
is weird for 2 reasons. One, the obviouse. Im going to die. And the other one is that i had another dream a while ago about getting all these check ups and didnt know what for.....

i think what this dream means is... dont fucking eat chcolate before bed... youll wake up seriously displaced. hehe.

Another day of traning. (fucking rising before the sun is so wrong if your straight)
Another day closer to Sydney. Another day closer. Another day closer.

Ive decided to opt for a coffee today... (im not much of a hot drinks boy if u didnt know.)
hopefully it spazes me about a lil and wakes me up...

well thats all i got time for.....

catch ya'll where the grass is greener."

sorry my wuss body isnt coping to well wuith this hangover on exam day...
but its all done and im darn sure i passed... who writes these things...
you would have failed if you had one of the following

a) incapability to read
b) no hands
c) a severe case of being dead.

so i have all of those 3 so im sure i passed.
though i think i just scraped in with the 3rd requirement.
SO YES! warmed up does count for something.

i think my lunchtime friend is going to be a whole lot of precious grease.
and i AINT talking travolta.... who needs scientology this time of the morning?
or oliva newton john for that matter.
Not I! i need a hamburger. the unhealthier the better.
2 all dead thing pattys whos lot in death is to soak up the liquid sin thats

I want no memories of thee.
Thank men for memory loss medication.
Bought for around 35 a piece.

pop the pill and pop a smile.
35 a piece and im leaving now
dancing, floating, drifting
though minds sky and sea.
with no regret of
losing all memory of thee."

"event","hey hey FUCKERS! hehehe your not all fuckers... 
i just felt like being tuff n shit...(i dont get enough hours on that clock. HAHA!)

how are we all? good i hope. much apologies to those i havnt contacted 
ive been well kidna busy. Working, the looking for work then putting together 
demo cds and the like. Im in work traning now. HA! exciting i hear you say!
yeh... informative though. But iot has been a while since ive been in a learning enviroment.
And its weird being older. You haqve this voice in the back of your head telling you to 
really remember the content. Unlike previous school years where u couldnt, didnt give a fuck!
HA-HA! B-

I have in this time away from all your beautiful smiles mamaged to put up a web page.
For my music that is. Its only got one set on it as it is a FREE website (go me) 
And ive also managed to lose some memory skills so i dont know if ive posted it before
but incase i havnt its

http://lmnopnoize.topcities.com

check it out. download it. 
give it shit. or praise me like i FUCKING DESERVE! hehe

What else is going on... hrmm not much. After this traning course im going 
to take a weekend away in sydney. Why? cause well why the hell not.
ive never been there before. know one or 2 people up there. 
going to get a spanking hotel room. Go out oparty party party.
then fly my ass home. It will be the first real holiday ive taken in a while.

I am playing at this joint birthday bash sooon. so lil lukie gets more time on the decks.
which is always a great plus. Its a costume party too! so there should be some funny photos
of me playing in some sort of rediculious costume. Which i really havnt figured out yet.

my ideas have been....
*storm trooper (who hasnt wanted to put one of those suits on! -girls need not answer,)
*male shovenist (or however the fuck you spell it. ive been up since 6:30 leave me alone!)
* Or get all in black and white and grey. do the face paint and go from someone from a old back and white movie.

im open to ideas.... REALLY open to ideas. So lemme know. 

Well im bored of typing and your probably bored of reading... if youve gotten this far.
get a life or get ready for impending future hug.

well.

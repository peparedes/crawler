"event","<small>yesterday was  gay as well as today. all day i stayed in my sweatpants and a wife beater an simply ate everything in my house . cereal , ice cream, potato chips, some healthy bar, and than the rest was pretty much candy. besides eating i layed in my bed, cleaned up my room a bit, an watched tv. the reason my day was so horrible was because my houseline for the phone was down , i got my cell phone taken away saturday night, and im grounded. grr , but thursday my punishment is over an i have tumbling that night im so excited :D i get to go to the cheer gym an see everyone. even though its only been a couple of days, i know this is about the last time i will see everyone so i am upset. the season is pretty much over an i want to cry. so many good times this year an traveling with sjs is wonderful :] from virginia, boston, baltimore, and florida i have made the nicest and wildest friends ever. i guess you can say im the luckiest girl in the world ? yeah i think so :D but lets get off the negatives [about missing everyone.] some positive things that happened today was me an my mom are getting along, and i played xbox ? lol . ok so now im gonna go an watch lizzie mcguire :] i still love the disney chanel ha , maybe ill write later \

"event","<small>so far, today isn't going to well. i woke up at 6:00 a.m in florida and now i am home in my bed awaiting easter dinner. i was in florida for spring break for competition. it was amazing and i spent the last few days in the sun, swimming, cheering, meeting new people, and i had a blast with my cheer friends. south jersey storm is amazing and i loveeee everyone there to death. also while i was there me and my two friends made some new guy friends in the pool =] mm hotties. nick, angel, and jake ha. well after i got on the plane today i wanted to cry. leaving the beautiful sun, palm trees, amazing hotel, and all my friends , it was devestating. knowing that it was the last time my team would ever be together hurt, because we became so close. on the brightside .. my friend michelle from storm was on my flight ( on jr prep pink ) and paige ( from senior coed ) i talked to them for a while but than our plane boarded and we were all on opposite sides of the plane. i was in the front and they were in the back . when i arrived at the airport my daddy was there and i couldnt help but smile when i saw his face. usually when we are apart for a few days i dont miss him but when me and my mom were fighting last night over something stupid and i was crying i just wanted my dad there to help me. me and my mom are ok now and i think she is going to let me cheer even though she stated, "" you are a rude ungrateful bitch who doesn't deserve anything not even cheerleading."" but oh well . i am not ungrateful but i agree that sometimes i can be bitchy, i mean who can't? than in the car i realized the mail was next to me :D i found the dooney & bourke magazine, macys, and pb teen. & MY CHEER PHOTOS =] so for once my photos didnt come out terrible . they were actually okk for once, atleast in my eyes. i admit i looked pail because i had just gotten over being sick, but i smiled and my hair looked perfect. maybe that will be my photo for my livejournal if i ever get around to copying it. when i got home i unpacked and saw all my new clothes from when me and my mommy shopped in florida =] of course i didnt put them away til my parents started yelling. what can i say, im a lazy person ? that brings me to now. im stuck in my room watching parental control on mtv and writing this entry. well i think i am going to shower before my parents friends come over so i don't look like a complete mess. ill write how my evening goes later"

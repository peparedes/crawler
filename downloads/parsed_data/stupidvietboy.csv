"event","Free State High School Administrators say problems with the way students dance at such events as homecoming and prom have prompted them to take some drastic measures.
Now if a student is caught dancing in a ""provocative"" way, they will be warned and then possibly kicked out of the dance.
Student council members have found a way to inform more students through a video (below) of their mascot showing what is and what is not appropriate.

All-motor power comes from a 3SGE yanked out of a fifth generation Japan spec Celica with a slew of custom mods. The fully built power plant sports 86-mm forged pistons, HKS cams, adjustable cam gears and valve retainers. The OEM crank was lightened and balanced, and the head was ported and polished by DansToy. An individual throttle body setup and manifold was also created by DansToy, which looks great under the same hood as his custom high-rise header."

Sarah McLachlan - Fallen

w00t.
i love this song, something about her voice is so soothing and enthralling.

on other news, i miss alycia so much, i got to see her a little bit today.
She kept asking why I skip baseball games and stuff to see her, it's because alycia is one of the most important things in my life and i'd gladly drop baseball to spend time with her...whoa...how many guys would do that?!

kathy and i were on our way to the oakland game when alycia called me and told me they had to put her oldest cat to sleep, so I told Kathy I was going to go back So she decided to go home and watch the giants game rather then watch the B string A's. So I dropped her off and went to Alycia's for a while and made sure she was okay. Drove away and noticed my differential was making a little noise, I think I'm leaking differential fluid...maybe it's time for synthetic *grin*.

anyway went to fry's and bought alycia an answering machine so she can use her good phone instead of aki's phone which is very staticy. Also bought myself an emergency nokia cellphone charger incase i ever run out of battery because i'm sleeping overnight or something. It's about the size of my zippo and gives 60 minutes talk time or 60 hour stand by....awesome.

also went to ohlone's bookstore today to ask if my ipod had been shipped, i wont know till tomorrow!

spent most of tonight talking to alycia online and webcam whoring myself on alpha-q.net/jle/webcam

i miss alycia, she said my webcam is both a good thing and bad thing, she can see me but not touch me. Sadly I can't see her this week due to our bad planning and hectic schedules, but I'm sure when we do see each other it'll be great. I'm going to make sure I'm well rested.

Weekend...possible celica gt?! maybe...
Norcalcelica's party fo sho tho...

anywho....im listening to a cd i burnt for alycia now, i am one sappy bastard.
i've been sitting around talking to alycia all night, watching a few movies, listening to music and going through pictures...sentimental i am...

eventually...my post count will get smaller and i will quietly disapear, so don't mind me. i'm just chillin'"

Did you see the sky
I think it means that we've been lost
Maybe one less time is all we need
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come
But still I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing and I'll swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
How you gonna ever find your place
Running in an artificial pace
Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand

I was working on writing, when I looked down from my chair at Anakin.  He had one teddy bear face-down on the floor, while another stuffed animal was spanking it.

I'm just like, ""Bwha?  Mer?  Huh?""

I asked him about it, and he said, ""I'm pretending that some of them got into something.""

Thankfully, I'm all about keeping a neutral expression.  I somehow managed to wait for him to explain that they got into something they shouldn't, and were being punished for it.  Still a little bit eek, but I was going to be REALLY disturbed if...well...you know...  O.o

Oh, the things kids say and pick up on..."

"event","Anakin is sick, and I'm trying very hard not to come down with his cold right now.  =/  It's NaNoWriMo, and the ideas are going well, but it's still stressy.  I'm worried about hurting the feelings of old friends by how much I have to change to write this story.  I'm equally worried about using ideas from our RP and being criticized for it or told off or called a theif.  Sure, sure, I have permission to use some of the characters, but they don't belong to me, and in some cases said characters changed the storyline so much while we were RPing that it would destroy the story I want to tell.  ~flop~

There's drama going on IRL, <strike>and I don't get where it's coming from.  I'm hearing two sides of an issue that just emphasizes the differences between the way men and women think differently, and how both of the people involved are taking things WAY too personally.  I wish they'd communicate instead of just talking at each other sometimes.  It *doesn't* help that both parties involved are dealing with depression.  I know from personal experience that it does make you take everything the other person says in the worst possible way.  One feels like they're being shut out, while the other feels like talking over the issue yet again is like hitting their head against a brick wall over and over.  With Anakin being sick and NaNo going on, it makes me want to smack them *both* upside the head!  And then hug them.  And then smack them around some more.  Then more hugs....</strike>

I need hugs.  And chocolate.  And hugs.  And words.  And hugs.  And a maid to cook me meals and clean while I try to cram as much writing as I can into the time of year where I can find writing inspiration in my newly realized competetive nature.

(Seriously.  I didn't realize I'm so competetive!  I don't mind losing.  It's disappointing if I do, sure, but it happens.  I'm also not all desperate to win at any cost.  I love to win, sure, but who doesn't?  But, between NaNo and playing WoW this past year, I realized that I really *am* a very competetive person.  Huh.  I'm still poking at that one, to see what it's all about.)"

"event","Thirty mosquito bites in the last week.  I just counted.

I might have missed a few that have healed since then.

I also sprained my left ankle on Thursday, trying to teach Anakin how to skip.  It *still* hurts.  Lots.  And is swollen.  Still.  On top of that, the Friday before that I tripped over loop of wire in the parking lot and cut the same ankle up on it in five spots.  Yes, it was rusty.  No, it didn't get infected.  Yes, I was scared to death since I haven't seen a doctor for any reason in way too long.

To top it off, Anakin has thrown tantrums in school every day, and has been written up twice.  That's right, in his first week of school.  I've had to talk to his teacher *every* *single* *day* in the past week.

That's the bad stuff that's worthy of note.

<hr>

Good stuff?  Martin is getting a raise and a promotion.  He'll have to work for two weeks straight so he can get training this weekend and he'll miss the walkthrough we're supposed to go to for the hotel.  (Phoenix Anime Fest business, if you missed that...)

Got back in touch with Six-chan, and have gotten some good RPing done with Emii.  I've missed journal-based games.  The flow is so different, and makes me itch to write again.

Other than tantrums when Anakin doesn't get his way, he's been a perfect angel in class.  His teacher said that 90% of the time he's the best student she's ever had.  It's just that one trouble spot...which isn't surprising when you take into account the part where it seems anger management seems to run on Martin's side of the family and takes quite a bit more than usual to control.  I'm mostly proud of Anakin, but very frustrated since his teacher said that if it keeps up he won't be able to remain in her class.  So, good *and* bad there.  And he's already doing better with homework than I did.  lol

Also, Cheryl came over and brought over things, and it was just really good to see her again.  It's been too long.  She's sweet, and a good friend to have.  We've missed her.

<hr>

I also got stuff.  Working speakers, a trackball, and Kingdom Hearts.  I'm in love with the game.  I didn't know if I'd honestly like it, or if I'd totally suck at it since I'm not the biggest video game player in the world, but it's great so far.  I'm loving the Disney stuff, and the Final Fantasy stuff, and and and...it's not as hard as I was afraid it would be.  Yay!

We bought all that on Friday...and all the walking at the store screwed up my ankle worse, of course.  But!  It didn't hurt that much when we left, so I thought it would be fine!

Stupid me.  lol

"event","Anakin is finally in school.  It was a little less stressful than I thought it would be, but I didn't have all of the info I needed.  Oh, and some of the questions they asked on the medical history had me totally boggling.  What's his bed time?  How much sleep does he usually get?  Does he *wet* the bed?  O.o  Eh.  Okay.  I kinda see why they asked, but at the same time...  I don't know, there were other things in that section that seemed a little intrusive.  As long as he doesn't have problems, it's none of their business.  And, if he *does* have problems, well, that's *my* problem, and I need to deal with it.  Maybe that's just me, though.

I feel bad that it took this long, though.  School started over a month ago.  OTOH, he was so happy to be there, and enthusiastic.  They put him in kindergarten, just to start with.  If he's more advanced, they can move him up a grade.  If not, he's happy where he's at.  When I left he'd already made a friend.  I'm more worried that he learns to behave himself and follow the rules than anything else, right now, since we did things very different from how they're done in school.

His teacher seemed very sweet.  Don't they all, when they teach *little* kids, though?  I've never met a kindergarten teacher who *didn't* seem very sweet and love kids and have what seemed like eternal patience, personally.

Now, let's hope they don't have a reason to call us until our cell phones are turned back on...  ~headdesk, many times~  When I asked my mom if she could float us $40 until next week, I didn't mean she should neglect the past due phone bill.  I'll give them the home phone  number this afternoon.  (I forgot it.  I never use it.  I'm *such* an idiot.)

I hope he's doing okay, still.  Please, let this work for him.  Please oh please oh please...

Now to find a job.  Um.  Yay."

You are most like Dionysus.  You are primarily interested in serving others, but your efforts are almost always unappreciated.  You aren't confrontational, you're often out of tune with your own needs and unaware of the consequences of your own actions.
<br><br>
You are, at heart, a good person.  You are very affectionate, and you are very loyal to your friends and family.  You are very reluctant to burden others with your own problems, to the point that this in itself can become a problem for the people who care about you.  This is a particular of a more general problem.  Dionysus sends wave of ruin throughout his personal life.  He is the photographer who seduces his subjects.  He is the teacher who seduces a student.  He is the art student who paints nonrepresentational splashes of color, he is the poet who rejects meter and content.  You seek sexual partners more than anything else (this is to exploit the nurturing side of others to help fill your own void).  If not sexual partners, this desire to become the object of sympathy with other people can manifest itself in other destructive ways.  Stinkfist by Tool explains your condition pretty well.  It's very likely that you haven't had many experienced mentors.  You don't want them either, because you're the sort of person who rejects criticism and boundaries, but they're also your only hope for reaching any kind of emotional maturity.

Famous People Like You: John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Marilyn Monroe, Hugh Hefner<br>
I'd tell you to stay clear of Hermes, Icarus and Apollo, but you could probably learn something from them.  You're least likely to hurt The Oracle, Atlas, Prometheus, and Daedalus, but Atlas and Daedalus won't like you very much.<br>Seek out: The Oracle, Prometheus

"event","<lj-cut text=""You must be out of high school to take this quiz"">

1. What bill do you hate paying the most?
Rent. I miss having a mortgage, because I actually got something *real* out of it, instead of just a box to stay in that I couldn't *do* anything with and could get kicked out of any month they really want, technically.

2. What's the best place to eat a romantic dinner?
Right next to the one you're in love with.

When I was about a week pregnant and didn't know it yet.  Sad timing, since I really don't drink that often.

Mrs. Smith

6. What do you really want to be doing right now?
Sleeping

7. What did you want to be when you were growing up?

8. How many colleges did you attend?

comfortable...or lace and satin...or, gods willing, both.

15. Favorite style of underwear for the opposite/same sex?
Opposite: None Same: lacey & feminine

16. What errand/chore do you despise?
Sweeping and mopping, with washing dishes a close second.

17. If you didn't have to work, would you volunteer at an art gallery?

26. Beach or lake?
Beach.

27. Do you think marriage is an outdated ritual that was invented by people who died at 20?
Guh!  Don't talk to me about marriage!  I'm SO fucking bitter about that right now.  -_-

Chocolate covered cherries.

30. Favorite movie you wouldn't want anyone to find out about?
I don't care who knows what my favorite movies are...so none.

46. If you could get away with it, who would you kill?
O.o  While I think the world would be a better place if my step-father were dead, uh, I couldn't bring myself to kill anyone in cold blood.  I think the only time I *might* kill someone, is if I saw them in the act of deliberately harming my son, and I couldn't get them to stop any other way.  Other than that, it's not in me, and I hope it never is.

47. What famous person would you like to have dinner with?
Spider Robinson

48. What famous person would you like to sleep with?
I can't think of anyone...but if the opportunity arose, I'm sure there's lots I wouldn't turn down?  (As if that would happen.  XD)

49. Have you ever had to use a fire extinguisher for its intended purpose?
Not unless you count ""emergency preparedness testing"" at Girl Scout Camp.

Yeah, but Anakin keeps stealing them.  lol

52. Strangest place you have ever brushed your teeth?

San Fransisco, maybe.  Maybe Hollywood.  ~shrug~  Most of the places in CA that I want to go to I've already been to.

54. Number of texts in a day?
.03 maybe?  If we average it out.  I'd do more, but they're five cents each on our plan.  ~kicks things~

55. At this point in your life would you rather start a new career or relationship?
Uh...neither.  Love stinks and I'd rather pull my eyes out through my belly button than try to start anything with anyone new, and I'm *content* with Martin and love him lots, and I don't *have* a career to start over unless you count writing, and, uh, not giving that up.  It's who I am, not just what I do.

56. Do you go to church?
No.

57. Pencil or pen?
Yes.

58. bueller??? bueller??? bueller?
Never saw that movie, don't care if I ever do.

"event","There is a new <a href=""http://www.phoenixanimefest.com/"">anime convention</a> in town.  I got to bantering with the organizer about it, mentioning my penniless state, and he pointed out that a) staff get in free, and b) there are staffing positions available.

A few emails later, I'm applying for Programming.

<lj-cut text=""personal thoughts and much rambling about the possibility"">

To me, that is like a dream!  I'm worried, though, because my con experience is limited, and with having a child with me at previous cons I never had a chance to even volunteer.  It would be wonderful, though, if I get this.  I may not be an organized person, but I *LOVE* organizing things.  Does that make sense?  The point is, I think I'd be good at it, with a little bit of help.  Hell, one of my biggest time-wasters at the computer is organizing and reorganizing my own files as I come up with ideas on how this or that would go better/make more sense.

The biggest challenge would be for me to find others who are interested in panels, who can follow through.  (You know, like I didn't with AniZona1?  ~hides~)  Actually, I think that that lapse in communication in just that case might be a good learning experience that I can apply to this.  I'd also make this a priority, since it would be official and not just for play.  No flaking out with the excuse of writing a novel I'm too flakey to actually deal with.  =/

I think, most of all, I want to do this so that I can talk myself out of this idea that I'm a total failure at everything.  This is me, grabbing life by the horns and <i>doing</i> something I want that will have an impact on a large number of other people.  Something I know I can do, if I don't talk myself out of it.  And, if I don't talk myself out of this, I can stop talking myself out of other things on a smaller scale.

I want this so bad.  I *could* do Info Desk and work on my issues with talking to people.  But this is what I really want to do.  Oh, hell, either one.

If I had a camera, it would kick much ass to be Historian, but I don't.  ~pout~  Programming just makes me want to raise my hand, bounce in my seat, and go ""Pick me!  Pick me!"" though.  I *can* do it.  It's exactly the kind of thing I like doing.  Details, organizing...YAY!
</lj-cut>
Now accepting wishes of Good Luck and You Can Do It!  ^_^  I'm just a *little* bit excited about the possibility, can you tell?"

It's even *cold* outside right now.

But my mom is coming over in a few hours, and I haven't had enough sleep.  At least, since we've all been sick, she won't be expecting me to be up and about much.  We'll watch movies and stuff.

And, by the way, thank you Rami.  I needed to vent.  I don't want to hang on to the negative shit, because keeping it all to myself just kills me slowly.  I feels loads better by being able to let it all out.  It'll make it easier to appreciate the positive left over.  And I'm starting to see hope again."

"event","Our home phone doesn't ring a whole heck of a lot.  We've got cell phones, and even though we're running out of minutes a little too frequently lately, it's a good thing.  What makes it really good?  Mostly the mobility, especially with a five-year-old in the house.

Kate called earlier, checking to see if Martin was doing better than yesterday.  (He came home sick, voice completely gone, yesterday afternoon.)  We just started talking a while, and Anakin poured me some milk/kool aid/water mixed together.  Yes, he made me try it.  No, it wasn't disgusting...but I don't think I'll ever want to drink that again.  Ick.

It would be nice if that was the worst of it.  Really.

We kept talking, and Anakin started up the microwave.  I've been teaching him how to use it a little, but I was planning on yelling at him for using it wintout permission anyway when I got off the phone.  He knows you don't put metal in and a few other things.  Well, he tried to make himself some mac 'n cheese.

Yes, the boxed kind.

No, not the kind you're *supposed* to microwave.  He emptied an entire box into a plastic container, poured the cheese powder over the top, and stuck it in there.  I don't know how long.  He took it out and said it wasn't done yet...and that's when I smelled it.  It was burnt.  I told him to *stop*, get it out of there, and I'd look at it in a second.  I got off the phone as fast as I could and went over there, and that's when I discovered what he'd done.

o.o

It was turning dark brown, and the plastic dish was melty on the bottom.  When I showed Anakin the melty parts he started bawling.  It was his ""favorite square bowl"" and now it was ruined.  He was sitting on my lap, clinging ot me, telling me he learned his lesson.

Fifteen minutes later he brought me out another drink.  Kool aid and water."

A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia.<br>
A Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often an obscure or difficult one.<br>
A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common social expectations/interactions.<br>


You scored better than half in Nerd and Geek, earning you the title of: Modern, <b>Cool Nerd</b>.
<br><br>
Nerds didn't use to be cool, but in the 90's that all changed. It used
to be that, if you were a computer expert, you had to wear plaid or a
pocket protector or suspenders or something that announced to the world
that you couldn't quite fit in. Not anymore. Now, the intelligent and
geeky have eked out for themselves a modicum of respect at the very
least, and ""geek is chic."" The Modern, Cool Nerd is intelligent,
knowledgable and always the person to call in a crisis (needing
computer advice/an arcane bit of trivia knowledge). They are the one
you want as your lifeline in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (or the one
up there, winning the million bucks)!

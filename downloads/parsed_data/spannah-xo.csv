I used to have one since I was like 10 and kept it for years but then I stopped and I've never touched it since. LJ is sorta the same. Whenever I have something <em>worth </em>going in here, I forgot to put it in or I'm too lazy, or I find something better to do. I reaaally want to get a group scrapbook, then we can all take turns writing stuff about us, and we can all have a profile each, and, yays, I have lots of ideas. Thing is, we haven't got one yet and I wanna start writing it in before X-mas.&nbsp;<br />Speaking of Xmas, I'm not getting a <u>Christmas dinner</u>! XD We are going to my aunty's house for a buffet. This'll be the first Christmas that I haven't been at home.<br /></font><font size=""1"">Yeah, like you cared ^^;<br /><br /></font><font size=""2"">I never have anything to say XDDD;;<br /><br />I'm going to redo my Gaia profile.

"event","Today I was off school because I had a headache and was feverish in the morning. I slept till gone one o'clock and slept my fever off.&nbsp; <br />People say that dreams are a collection of your thoughts before you go to sleep, and I must have been thinking an awful lot last night and this morning. I think I had like a dosen dreams all mixed up and intertwined. None of them were good enough for story material, just random things about my life. You know when you are unable to acutally remember the dream in detail but you remember the feelings and emotions you experienced in them. Yeah, I feel that. I feel like I'm thinking about things too much, and to be honest, that's not really like me.<strong> Odd.</strong> <br /><br />On another note; the inner sheet of glass on our cooker exploded today. It's a mystery why it did it, the chips weren't even cooked. It was pretty scary. Anyway it's gonna be okay 'cuz of the insurance. Frankie [the dog] was asleep and was gave a fright. He was so frightened he woke up with a start and peed on the sofa -_-;; <em>niiiiiiiiiice.</em> <br /><br />I also think my dog might be gay/bisexual/sexually confused, because he met two male dogs today and... yeah seemed pretty 'frisky' with them <br />o.O <br />When he is older, he is going to be a Daddy because my Dad has a friend with a girl border collie, and we are hoping they will make little puppies ^^ <br />His 'gayness' is probably a phase *pat pat* <br /><br />I got inspired by a painting today as well. It was a painting of a young girl and it looks so gloomy. It was dimly lit by a victorian-looking light too. I am going to incorporate it into 'Demons of Sin' because I stared at it for at least ten minutes, just caught by the emotion of it. The girl looked so sad, a half smile. I wondered about it's history and who it was. I should have taken a photo of it. <br /><br />FUCKING knackered, AND I have to be up early tomorrow <font size=""4""><strong>*dies*</strong></font> <br /><br />Anyways, this is a -long- journal for me, 'cuz I only usually write short things in LJ ^^; <br /><br /><em><strong>Much love ~ Spannah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; XO </strong></em>"

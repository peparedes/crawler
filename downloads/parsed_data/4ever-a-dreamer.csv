"event","I dont have the energy to decribe everything that has done wrong with my day today so here is the shory version. Dunkin Donuts messed up my order on 2 different locations and stores. I went through 3 shirts because Bobby got food/drink on 2. Angela woke up crying and would let me put her down. My nail stylist forgot to call and ask me 2 come in 30 minutes early so I flew there to help her out. Go to work and find out that the legally blind hostess is working, meaning i did ALL the work. She leaves, get slammed, walk in 20, dumb people always want to sit at the dirty table. No change for registers becuase John never went to bank, only $100s, $50s, $20s, $1s, no quarters or nickles. 

Yes that is the VERY short version. If you love me and are willing to listen to me vent about my very bad day, please call me at my house tomorrow so I can vent. Thank you very much for listening. *muah*"

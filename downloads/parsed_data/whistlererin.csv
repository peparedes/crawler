Beginning at 8:00, our family began hunting for matching socks and Easter dresses. We brushed hair and applied coconut oil. We buttoned and straightened and switched the boys' shirts because it turned out Bean's was longer. We curled and wiped and buckled. At 10:00 we went to church and were almost on time. <br />
<br />
Throughout the chaos of entering the building and getting coats hung up, Abi began doing her trick, something we have come to call ""Mommy-shopping."" finding the nearest willing adult, she pours on the charm, taking a hand to be led (she knows the building like a book if she needs to, so it's not like she needs to be led) or even asking to be lifted. She smiles and asks, ""Hello? How are you?"" and people immediately fall in love. If we don't catch it, she'll make friends to the point that she bids me a cheerful farewell, and fully expects to go home with the new Mommy. This person, you see, is smiling and snuggling her, and has no intention of ever scolding her like the mean old Mommy she's just said goodbye to! This new Mommy won't make her go to bed or share her toys, surely. And since it's been a few months, it's obviously time to move on!<br />
<br />
Sorry, kid, that's NOT how things are. All of our training warned us that this would happen. It's a classic part of the attachment process. As a result, we have been doing what we were instructed to do by the social workers and attachment therapists: nip the Mommy-shopping in the bud. We won't let people hold her or play with her, or hold her hand. <br />
<br />
In a church full of extremely friendly, motherly middle-aged women, you have no idea how incredibly difficult this can be! I had to disengage her holding hands with at least four different people, scoop her up, and politely explain to them why they would have to wait to make friends. The fact that she's blind makes the problem ten times worse, as they try to smile and engage her from a distance, but when that doesn't work, they move in to touch her. <br />
<br />
On a good note, though, church represented another milestone. It was the first time in months the whole family was there at the same time. During the fellowship hour after church, a time when traditionally Abi has had an absolute meltdown, either trying to squirm down and get away from us or merely flipping out and shrieking at being so overwhelmed, this time she sat calmly in my arms while I talked to people for ten minutes or so. I saw it as a huge improvement, even though she spent a good portion of the service pouting because we did not let her tickle Daddy when she wanted to. One step at a time!<br />
<br />
This year, I found myself rejoicing more than usual in the triumph of Christ's resurrection, and even in His suffering. The fact that He knows what we're going through when life is tough and the days are each a thousand hours long strikes me as wonderfully comforting. As the spring comes slowly, day by day, so does our new normal. Each day brings us one day closer to finding our feet in this strange, beautiful, messy, breathtaking journey. <br />

"event","Abi had a post-op visit with Dr. W and this time the surgery was successful in that it accomplished our goal of lowering her eye pressure. Praise God! It got the pressure in her eye down from 30 to 7! (15-20 is normal and we wanted the lower the better.) Now that the good eye is safe for now, and her scrap of sight can be saved a little longer, we are looking at her bad eye. If we remove the cataract and do the same glaucoma surgery for lowering the pressure, we might find out if she has any sight behind the cataract worth saving. Dr. W thinks the optic nerve may be already very damaged from the glaucoma pressure, but if we can take out the cataract and maybe give her even light perception in that eye, it will be worth it. So... surgery is scheduled for May 1."

"event","This afternoon while killing time after Abi's surgery in Spokane, we went for a walk in the sunshine, with Daddy carrying a surprisingly chipper Abi. <br />
<br />
A block from our hotel stands the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist and on a whim, we stopped in to look at the beautiful interior. From her perch on Daddy's shoulders, Abi began making quick, sharp shouts, testing the echoing acoustic inside the shadowy, tall church. Together, we all made noises and enjoyed the reverberating echoes that came back from the acoustically live room. <br />
<br />
Back outside, she let out a few more shouts, which the acoustically dead, tree-lined street absorbed. <br />
<br />
""Ciao huulet Abi (Goodbye, second Abi),"" she hollered, referring to the little echo friend she'd made inside. <br />

Until next time. <br />

On this day last year, I cried because my little girl spent her birthday an ocean away. <br />
<br />
Today, though, she is here surrounded by the love of her forever family. The thought makes me want to cry again, but with joy, not grief. <br />
<br />
We gave her a couple of presents, spreading them out over the last few days. There was a See-n-Say from Grandma N, and her own stuffed Orca (a hot item currently at our house). &nbsp;This morning we gave her our ""big gift"" of a new baby doll. Other than that, we plan to keep it completely low-key, because she is still so unsettled at changes or visitors. <br />
<br />
Usually I would be upset at the lack of a celebration, party, Grandmas, piles of gifts... This time, though, I just want to hold my girl close and help her heart become one more day secure with us. To me, that is celebration enough!  <br />

This morning at the bright and early hour of 7:30, our whole family went to the local elementary school to discover the results of Abi's Special Ed assessments. <br />
<br />
For Curly and Mister, it was the first time they had ever been into a ""real school."" I watched them with interest to see what they would think of the classrooms full of desks and the artwork on the walls. They peered curiously into the rooms we passed, and asked questions about the daily routine. <br />
<br />
The preschool room we eventually entered seemed much more fun to me, as it was filled with toys! The kids played for 45 minutes while we listened to the SpEd team do their best to soften the blow to us that Abi actually doesn't qualify for services. Since we didn't really want to bother with services anyway, we were not as disappointed as they expected us to be. It's nice to know that our observations were correct, that she is doing well adjusting (it's a process!) and that she is very bright and well-adjusted to coping with blindness. &nbsp;She seems to be a good mix of daring and careful, willing to explore and try new things, but to ask for help when needed and maintain a good sense of safety and avoid danger.<br />
<br />
One thing I did not expect AT ALL was the compliment I received from the SpEd teacher during the meeting. My experience in the past led me to expect public schoolteachers to be anti-homeschool, but this teacher described our ""rich home environment"" as an ""ideal place for learning."" Whoa! <br />
<br />
For unschooling to be successful, one of the most important keys is creating a rich learning environment. Children need to be surrounded by educational materials, and learning needs to be seen as a fun experience that should be engaging at all times. For the teacher to acknowledge that our house is such a place makes me feel so great! I don't get a lot of affirmation that we're doing things right, and sometimes doing something so radically outside the common educational practice is unsettling. I often ask myself, ""what if this doesn't work?"" or ""what if I'm not doing enough?"" This was a nice little compliment and hearing that I am doing something well for my kids' education. <br />
<br />
As we drove back home, talking about how we'd spend our day, Curly began asking more questions about school. She wanted to know if I liked school as a kid. I told her that at her age, in first grade, I really did. By seventh grade, not so much. She considered this, and decided that she might like school too.  It's true. She might. <br />

On&nbsp;Saturday, Hubby's grandparents, called Grandma and Grandpa GG by the kids, came up from Oregon to visit us and spoil us. &nbsp;They played with the great-grandkids until I'm sure they were completely exhausted!</div>

They brought early Easter baskets that were easily ten times the size of any other Easter basket I have ever seen in my life. &nbsp;After my recent trip to Africa where little kids have nothing of the sort, yet are as happy as can be, I wonder if American consumerism is really a good thing or not. &nbsp;But the kids had a wild evening, buzzed out on sugar and playing with the toy cars.<br />

Bean, who ate most of the contents of his basket while I wasn't watching, did not sleep the entire night. &nbsp;Neither, apparently, did Hubby, but I was spared some of the drama by wearing ear plugs. &nbsp;I wanted to give Hubby a medal for&nbsp;fielding&nbsp;that one!<br />

Abi discovered a fiber-optic light that delivered rotating colors right to her eye. &nbsp;Although we don't think she can see color, she could see the light change, and she was fascinated, carrying it around for the rest of the evening.<br />

The best part of the visit was that Grandpa GG blessed us with a pickup truck! He joked that it was a late graduation present that he never had a chance to give Hubby back then. Still, it's a huge blessing, since it's been difficult to take care of the house and do chores like run to the dump or haul gravel for our muddy driveway without a pickup truck. &nbsp;We're so tickled and I'm sure it will get a lot of good use. :)</div>"

Blind kids, on the other hand, miss out on the reading practice unless someone (in this case, Mom) sprinkles Braille around everywhere that little fingers land. &nbsp;The SpEd teacher at the school district also recommended that I do this, and though my style isn't ""let's label everything in the house until the family feels like they are living in a Preschool classroom,"" I agreed with her that the importance of encountering braille in everyday life trumps my own personal style.</div>

"event","This morning, we roused four sleepy, tousled children at 6 am.  Three of them would be staying with friends and family, while Hubby and I took Abi to Spokane to have an exam under anesthesia and possible surgery.  In spite of the snow flurries, our drive there was uneventful, and we got checked into the Pediatric Surgery and talked to our Ophthalmologist. (Aside: see how many big words I can now spell right? For a long time, I had to rely on the squiggly red line to help with ""ophthalmologist."")

Things went smoothly, until the surgeon came to us with sagging shoulders after the procedure.  It had not been successful.

Let me try to explain in a nutshell what had happened.  Abi's eyes are large and swollen due to congenital glaucoma.  This means that the little valve in her eyes that drains fluid from her eyeball never formed when she was tiny.  As a result, the pressure inside each eyeball has risen to extremely high levels, permanently damaging her optic nerves.

The doctor intended to check her pressure today, and if it was high, he'd attempt to create an artificial drain in her eyeball.  It was high, and the procedure turned surgical.  He ran into trouble, however, by the fact that the ""wall"" of her eye, the sclera, is so thin and stretched that he was unable to separate the layers to create a channel for the fluid to drain without cutting all the way through and seriously damaging the eye.

So now we're left with a dilemma.  Do we attempt another surgery (or another? or another?) to lower the pressure and save the scrap of sight she has in her left eye? How useful is that fragment of limited sight to her anyway? What exactly can she even see? Do we forgo additional surgeries on her already delicate and damaged left eye?  Her sight may not be able to be saved much longer even if we do multiple surgeries.  How inevitable is total blindness?  Do we seek a second opinion? A third? Do we travel to points yonder seeking other specialists?

Conventional ""sighted"" wisdom says to fight to save her sight at all costs.  Blind friends tell me stories about multiple painful and ultimately unnecessary and invasive surgeries they have undergone that they wish they hadn't had to endure.  My own experience with low vision and interacting with eye doctors colors my opinion somewhat, and Hubby is wrestling with the same questions from the viewpoint of perfect sight, but knowing Abi was blind before we ever finalized her adoption.

It goes without saying that we'll pray for wisdom.  We'll talk and weigh every option. We'll make the best decision that we can make for the welfare of our daughter.

But, man oh man, is it a hard decision."

Soak the lentils in 3c. water overnight. The next day, rinse them and boil them gently in 3c. fresh water until they are soft and paste-like. It may take 3 hours or more. Cover them while they boil, and stir occasionally, and take care not to boil them over or let them get too dry. Makes 2 batches. Freezes well.</div>

<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
Dice the onion very fine. Heat oil in a small saucepan until a drop of water sizzles when flicked into it. Add the onion, berbere and salt and cook until the onion is browned and soft. Add 1/2 c. water (carefully, it will pop!) and 1/2 the lentil paste from before, and let boil for a few minutes. &nbsp;If it is too thick, add more water... too thin, and you can boil for a while to cook some water off. &nbsp;</div>

Lately, a treat in the evenings for us is to rent a movie, make a BIG batch of popcorn, and rotate the kids through bath time. &nbsp;I remember loving popcorn as a kid (still do) so it's fun to watch my own kids with the big popcorn bowl on their laps. &nbsp;It's funny how that food gets so many nicknames. &nbsp;My family called it ""Pock-um"" after an early baby word of someone's, and now we call it ""Fandesha,"" which is the Amharic word. &nbsp;Whatever you call it, it's yummy!</div>

I didn't really understand ""doing hair"" until I went to Ethiopia. Here in America, we do our hair in front of a mirror, usually quickly, before we go somewhere. &nbsp;My older daughter, while she likes her long, pretty hair, does <i>not </i>like it to be fussed over, and protests me even brushing it. &nbsp;Under duress, I can sometimes get in a quick braid, but it's rare. &nbsp;</div>

In Africa, I saw something completely different. &nbsp;Even at the orphanage, I saw nannies sitting on a step in the sun, while a little girl sat quietly between her knees and she massaged oil into the curly hair, and then carefully braided rows of tiny braids. &nbsp;Both were smiling, both unhurriedly enjoyed the process.</div>

<br />
That day I realized something. Doing hair is as much about the process as it is about getting the result. &nbsp;It is about love and bonding and pampering. &nbsp;It's about conversation and singing together.<br />
<br />
Today, there is a blizzard blowing outside, so my little African princess and I could not sit in the sun. &nbsp;Instead, I built a big, warm fire. &nbsp;I set up a chair and a stool. &nbsp;The coconut oil and combs made an appearance. &nbsp;She understood right away, and settled herself on the stool with her little toes stretching out toward the fire.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<br />
We talked. &nbsp;She chattered in Amharic. I understood words here and there. &nbsp;""Toy"" and ""Cody"" and ""Car."" She told me about the movie she watched this morning. She sang songs. &nbsp;We sang songs together. &nbsp;As she relaxed into my knees, I massaged pure coconut oil into her curls, and combed and twisted. &nbsp;My hands moved gently over her head. &nbsp;We took our time; we had nowhere to go.<br />
<br />
When I finished, she ran to show her big sister the pretty hair that Mommy had done. &nbsp;I gave her a little clip with a kitty on it. &nbsp;I could tell her love tank was overflowing as she glowed with the knowledge that she was beautiful.<br />
<br />
My eyes got misty as I silently sent a prayer of thanks for the time I spent in Africa, to see how to slow down. &nbsp;I needed to learn, not how to <i>do hair</i>, but <i>how</i> to do hair. &nbsp;How to really do hair,to put aside my product-oriented western mindset, and my impatient agenda; to enjoy the closeness and to listen to my daughter's heart. How to combine physical touch with quality time, service, gifts and words of affirmation to shower love on my little daughter on a snowy Saturday morning.</div>"

After posting on a Facebook group about Bean's eczema, I realized I never posted on here about it since I was making special outfits for him two summers ago. In case other moms are looking for things that work, I thought I'd go ahead and update.<br />
<br />
Whether he outgrew it, or whether our treatments finally worked, we DID successfully clear up Bean's eczema entirely. &nbsp;We still use this:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.gentlenaturals.com/products/eczema-baby-wash"" target=""_blank"">Eczema Baby Wash</a>&nbsp;exclusively on him rather than soap. &nbsp;We only bathe him once or twice a week, and sometimes after a bath, we rub him with a gentle, natural, unscented oil or pure olive oil. &nbsp;I also wash his clothes using All Free and Clear detergent.<br />
<br />
The other thing that helped the most to clear up the rashes, and still helps us if he has a flare-up, is the Pediatrician gave us a prescription for Triamcinolone Acetonide, which is a steroid in a petroleum base. &nbsp;We have to be careful to use it sparingly and for less than two weeks at a time, but it clears up itchy flare-ups in a couple of days.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to say that in the last year or so, we have had almost no problems at all with itchy skin rashes. :)</div>"

Because we live in a VERY small town in Idaho with VERY few Ethiopians, I knew that the only way to expose Abi to the culture of her home country was to try to recreate as much of it myself as I could. &nbsp;I learned to cook several Ethiopian foods (the injera is still a work in progress), and I took careful mental notes on how to do a coffee ceremony.</div>

The scent of the frankincense took us back immediately to Addis. &nbsp;I wonder if it made Abi feel homesick. &nbsp;She didn't act melancholy, but was bouncing around&nbsp;singing&nbsp;about ""Boona"" (coffee) and ""Fandesha"" (popcorn).<br />

Now that I feel confident roasting the coffee and performing the ceremony, I plan to invite friends over for a cultural show-and-tell in the future. &nbsp;I also can do coffee ceremonies to celebrate things like birthdays or holidays. <br />
<br />
I have to admit, I felt inordinately proud of myself for successfully recreating this ancient, beautiful ceremony. &nbsp;I want to teach my kids about Abi's culture and heritage, and incorporate it into our own family's traditions. &nbsp;Someday, if she goes back to Ethiopia, I hope she recognizes the whiff of frankincense and the taste of injera.<br />

Most people think a blind person sees only black.&nbsp; In Abi's case, she sees a wee pocket off the left side, if the object is held just inches from her face.Her eyesight was damaged by congenital glaucoma, which was not caught and treated early enough, so it damaged her optic nerves.<br />

Since
 she has seen this way ever since she can remember, though, she never 
gives it a second thought.&nbsp; She's learning to use a long, white cane to 
walk by herself, and she loves it! She loves feeling braille on her 
books in preparation for learning to read, and she's fantastic at 
recruiting a friend if she needs help at Homeschool Co-op.&nbsp; She acts 
just like the other kids, and does age-appropriate chores like clearing

The ophthalmologist said that it's very likely she's lose what little sight she has at some point, a fact we were aware of months ago when we received her medical information from the adoption agency.&nbsp; Although losing the rest of her sight may feel traumatic for her for a while, I hope that having a good foundation in blindness skills, braille, and cane travel will help her realize that she isn't going to be held back in life at all by blindness.&nbsp; She can still do anything she wants to do (with the exception, maybe of a stock-car driver or air force pilot) and be anything she wants to be.&nbsp; She is so beautiful, intelligent and outgoing, I have little doubt in her ability to live a full, successful life.</div>"

"event","Today is the one-month anniversary of me getting Abi in Africa, and tomorrow is the four-week mark from her homecoming day.  As a representative day of how things are going, she ate Cheerios and bananas for every meal (although she eats other stuff too, sometimes) and did fantastic at Homeschool Co-op.  She is really outgoing and loves other people, no matter what age.  She knows about twenty words in English, but still mostly communicates using our limited Amharic.

Naptime went well, and then I took her out in the back yard for the first time. She freaked out and screamed at the dog (he was in his run, so could not kiss her) but loved the tire swing.  Shortly, she got really cold, and wanted to come in.  About dinner time, she and Cody were taking turns trying to outdo each other with who could be the most obnoxious, and I thought I might go nuts. Finally, she quit asking me for stuff and whining, and started crawling around pretending to be a cat.

Tonight we all six went grocery shopping, and then we all pitched in to do chores: putting the groceries away, music practice, laundry, dishes and getting the littles ready for bed.  We had so much fun listening to music really loudly on the stereo and working together, I realized I LOVE having a big family."

While we were in the guesthouse in Ethiopia, I asked the cook to translate for me. ""Drink your water,"" was what I asked her to tell Abi. &nbsp;She poured forth in a stream of Amharic, upon which Abi quickly drank her entire cup of water. &nbsp;I remember feeling satisfaction that the cook had produced such good results, and I asked what she had said.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">

Our family includes a very sweet, very nice, and very exuberant 80 pound black&nbsp;Labrador. &nbsp;He loves the kids, and LOVES to give them wet, sloppy kisses, no matter how much I try to break him of the habit.</div>

The other day, I let Shadow in for a little bit when Abi was up, but mostly I have been having Hubby walk him (Hubby hates dogs), and playing with him in the evenings when the kids are in bed, and feeling really guilty that he is outside alone all day instead of with us, his pack.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
Really guilty.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
And I miss him.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
Today I decided to bite the bullet. &nbsp;If Shadow is to be a part of this family, Abi is going to have to face her fear of him and learn that he will not in fact eat her.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
Sigh.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
With a sincere prayer for strength and patience, I put Abi on the couch, warned the kids that the ""Woosha"" (dog) was coming ""wust"" (inside), and opened the back door. Like a joyful, 80 pound tornado, Shadow burst into the house and headed straight to the table to look for bites under it. &nbsp;Abi began to whimper. &nbsp;Like before, I held her and introduced her to the dog with lots of petting and reassuring words.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
When I went into the kitchen, the storm broke. &nbsp;She climbed off the couch to follow me into the kitchen. &nbsp;The dog curiously&nbsp;investigated&nbsp;this new human that smelled deliciously of coconut oil, and gave her a big, sloppy kiss. &nbsp;</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
I didn't think Abi could scream louder than the Bean, but I was wrong.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
She&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;flipped out. &nbsp;Poor kid, she was shaking and screaming. &nbsp;She oozed terror from every pore.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
Hmm, this wasn't going well.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
At first, I tried comforting her, but I knew she couldn't hide from the dog; she needed to interact with him. &nbsp;She needed to ""see"" him and discover that he wasn't going to eat her. &nbsp;It would take time.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
It did. &nbsp;For almost an hour she screamed at the absolute top of her lungs. &nbsp;It sounded like someone was murdering her slowly using every torture method known to human history, and pouring lemon juice in the wounds at the same time.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
The poor, sweet dog cowered, wondering what he could possibly have done wrong.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
I continued to force her to pet him and touch him, feeling like the most cruel despot to ever force another human being to face her fears. &nbsp;I wondered if I was doing this right.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
I told her in as many words as I could that the dog would NOT eat her. He was a nice dog, a kind dog and he would not hurt her. &nbsp;I told her she was okay.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
We tried getting some doggy treats to show her what he DID eat (as opposed to little Ethiopian girls).</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
I tried to tell her that we did not bring her all the way from Ethiopia just to feed her to the dog. &nbsp;She shrieked.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
I expected a knock on the door any time with a&nbsp;curious&nbsp;neighbor wondering who was being racked.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
At last, AT LAST, she calmed down.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
At last, she touched him.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
Then, OH LORD ALMIGHTY, her inner drama queen kicked in. &nbsp;She began following the dog around holding her hand out, enticing him to lick her. &nbsp;When she did, she screamed and kicked him.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
Well, that had to stop.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
I scolded her and told her to be nice to the dog.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
She pouted.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
Sigh.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
Then she tried grabbing my pants and hiding behind me. &nbsp;That had to stop too.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
I went an hid in the bathroom.</div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">
I prayed.</div>

As I posted <a href=""http://whistlererin.blogspot.com/2012/02/getting-close-enough.html"">here</a>, I have been trying to find a way to let Abi enjoy shows with us, but not block the screen for everyone else. &nbsp;Today, I tried logging in to two different Netflix accounts, so they would play the same show&nbsp;simultaneously. &nbsp;I set up one show on the iPod Touch, and the other on the laptop. &nbsp;I synced them as closely as I could, and then muted the iPod. &nbsp;Abi was thrilled with the small screen that she could hold closely and see. &nbsp;I put it into a plastic sleeve (originally a package to hold paper clips) so she could not accidentally touch the screen and change the settings.</div>

So far, it has worked well until one device stops playback unexpectedly, and we lose the sync. Hopefully, that won't be a continual problem, and we can at least all enjoy Netflix shows. &nbsp;We may be able to do something similar with DVDs if we do a little planning and rip them onto the iPod beforehand.</div>

We have a problem that needs solving here. In order to get close enough to the screen to see it and enjoy it, Abi's head is blocking the picture for everyone else. Sometimes we banish Abi to the couch, which means she is reduced to only listening to the soundtrack; sometimes everyone crowds around the screen, which results in frustration and pushing one another out of the way. <br />
<br />
Because her field of vision is so small, the kind of screen Abi can see best is an iPhone-sized screen held inches from her face. I can play Netflix movies on that device for her, but not the same movie as the other kids are watching as it won't let me play the same show on two devices. <br />
<br />
The best solution I can think of is setting up a dual-screen monitor with a small screen that she can hold, and a long enough cable that she can sit on the couch with us. If we can somehow manage to get her own tiny, duplicate screen, we could all enjoy a show together. We're still brainstorming how to make it work. <br />

For the past year, Miss A has been living in Tennessee, so we have not seen her. &nbsp;We've kept in touch by email, and she reads my blog, but she has been really missing Bean. &nbsp;Last week, she and her&nbsp;fiancee&nbsp;drove all the way across the country back to Idaho, and one of the first things she did was to call us and arrange a lunch date.</div>

She kept exclaiming how big he was, and how handsome. We tried to get him to pose for pictures, but his mind was on the playland, and he didn't really want to give a smile for the camera. Whenever I see pics of them together, I marvel at how much alike they look. Darling. :)</div>

Finally, we released all the kids to go play on the playland, and we sat around chatting and watching them. &nbsp;Miss A and Mr. M took tons of pictures, and told us about their job plans. &nbsp;We also found out a few medical details about Bean that we hadn't known before. <br />
<br />
I'm so proud of Miss A. She is so strong, and has made some really tough choices to make her life better. &nbsp;She got dealt a rougher hand than most people will ever have to deal with, but she is making good decisions and thinking about her future. &nbsp;I am so glad to get to connect with her again, and I know she's glad to see Bean, although the goodbyes are always bittersweet.</div>"

Woo hoo! Mommy's injera and shirro wat meet with Abi's approval. I'm pretty sure she enjoyed having some comfort food that tastes like home. <br />

Curly made a ship today. She chose the project, and a friend of mine who has a daughter about the same age helped us by purchasing the little craft kits and bringing them over one day. Curly painted every piece herself, and with a little help from me, glued the whole thing together, following the instructions.<br />
<br />
I thought it turned out really cool, although it might help to take a stitch around the booms to hold the sails in place as the glue doesn't quite hold them. &nbsp;Still, for a seven-year-old, I'm pretty impressed. &nbsp;:)</div>"

I don't have a lot to write about the plane rides. &nbsp;I'd been dreading them for months, but as expected, we survived. &nbsp;Waiting in line for numerous security checks and customs wasn't much fun, but our agency had done their work thoroughly, and we had no holdups at all. &nbsp;Mostly it was just long (34 hours from door to door). &nbsp;Abi slept and played with little toys and chattered to nearby passengers, who all thought she was adorable. &nbsp;She sang little Amharic songs at the top of her lungs, and when the plane had a TV screen that was close enough for her to see, she played with that. &nbsp;By the last flight, she was beginning to shut down for pure fatigue and feeling overwhelmed. &nbsp;To be honest, so was I, and I cried when I saw my family waving to us from the window of the Lewiston airport.</div>

This is the last post about our trip. From here on out, we move forward into our new life, with more homeschooling, more offspring cuteness, more on adapting to blindness, more recipes and just more living each day and embracing whatever comes. As Robert Capon says so eloquently about parenting:<br />
<br />
""I find that my fine generalities have dashed themselves to pieces against the six very concrete children that I have. I live surrounded by a mixture of violence and loveliness, of music and insensitivity. I take my meals with clods and poets, but I am seldom certain which is which. Nowhere is my life less reducible to logic than in my children; nowhere are my elegant attempts at system ground more violently to powder than under the stumbling stone of the next generation. Far from having advice to give you, I am dumbfounded by them and admit it. And yet I rejoice too, for nowhere is there so much to keep me sane. I apologize in advance but I know only one word to describe it: It is absurd.<br />
<br />
- Robert Capon, Bed and Board<br />
<br />
Have a wonderful day, and thanks again for all of the prayers, comments, encouragement, and kind words you have given us through this amazing journey. :)</div>"

In Ethiopia, a coffee ceremony is used to say farewell, to celebrate something, or just to enjoy one another's company. &nbsp;The day before we left Addis, Abi had two coffee ceremonies so she could say good bye to her home, her country, and the people who loved her.</div>

<br />
The first was at the KVI orphanage. This is her biological father and his mother, who had cared for Abi as an infant. &nbsp;She was overwhelmed with joy that Abi had not starved to death, like she had thought, and that she was going to get to go to America and get a family, good food and an education. &nbsp;She wept and said that God has a plan for this child's life (I agree!).<br />

Abi (in purple) surrounded by her friends and roommates. &nbsp;These kids become like siblings and she still talks about many of them. &nbsp;The nannies try to prepare the kids for leaving by playing a game on their hands where they say the names of all of the children, and then one ""leaves"" by walking away up the child's arm and tickling them.<br />
<br />
All of these children are without parents. &nbsp;Most have parents still living, but they cannot feed them or care for them, or the parents have died of AIDS.<br />

<br />
Abi's birth family and all the nannies attended her coffee ceremony, which was more of a tea/juice ceremony than coffee. &nbsp;Her birth father spoke a blessing over her that made me cry. &nbsp;I can tell he loves her so much and he is sad that he may never see her again, yet he is happy for her to get this chance at a good life.<br />

The nannies told stories of her and said prayers for her and for us to raise her well. &nbsp;They also had some of the kids sing songs of praise to God and say blessings over Abi.<br />

<br />
Kids from the older class attended as well. &nbsp;Many had sweet things to say about Abi, who was a favorite with everyone. &nbsp;One little boy said she was so pretty, he wanted her for his wife someday! &nbsp;Everyone laughed at that.<br />

The little ones had just had a snack, which was the reason for the matching shirts. &nbsp;The little girl in the center let me braid her hair, and I think the staff was really impressed that a ""ferengi"" (white foreigner) could braid hair.<br />

This woman, the head nurse, gave Abi a kiss and a little gift. &nbsp;All of the nannies and orphanage staff were teary at saying goodbye to her, which showed how much she was loved. &nbsp;It shows now, that she had gotten good care and affection. &nbsp;Their investment in her will help her bond with us, and will stay with her for the rest of her life. &nbsp;I am so grateful for loving foster parents and orphanage nannies around the world who love kids until they can find their forever families! &nbsp;It makes a huge difference for these kids who need that love.<br />

Before we brought Abi home, I watched a fabulous training seminar called ""<a href=""http://www.heartofthematterseminars.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=117&amp;Itemid=101"">Because they Waited</a>"" that dealt specifically with toddler adoption. &nbsp;I loved the clear, concise way they taught us what our kiddos need, why they act the way that they do, and the practical solutions to build trust, bonding, and to meet the needs that were not met at the correct developmental age so that their mental development can progress from a new foundation of care, love and met needs.</div>

Although she is nearly four, I have been bottle-feeding Abi at the same times as I do for the Bean. &nbsp;The warm milk soothes her, and the mommy-feeding position communicates to her who I am and promotes attachment.<br />

This morning, Abi was tearful, and was having a difficult time coping. &nbsp;Bean kept attacking her, and she could not even deal with a choice of what to eat for breakfast. &nbsp;I think the honeymoon period has ended, and she has subconsciously realized that this crazy, weird-smelling, non-Amharic-speaking house where she doesn't understand the unwritten rules is going to be hers for a while.<br />
<br />
So while she moped, I slung her on my back in the Ergo I purchased for that purpose. &nbsp;Not only does it feel very African, but it feels very safe, very close, and Bean can't reach her. <br />

I have been trying to give Bean as much extra positive attention and guidance as I can. &nbsp;His behavior matches any 2yo when a new baby comes home, and I know it will improve over time. &nbsp;Trying to hold him, talk to him, show affection to him, and at the same time, consistently enforce manners, respect and boundaries already seems to be helping his craziness subside.<br />

Curly and Mister both enjoy their new little sister, although the language barrier makes it difficult for them to interact directly. &nbsp;Curly in particular keeps trying to say Amharic words, give Abi toys and find ways to talk and interact with her. &nbsp;Abi, on her part, thinks Curly is pretty darn cool, and loves to parrot her English words ad nauseum, much to Curly's amusing dismay.<br />
<br />
Mister has been more reserved, which is his personality. &nbsp;I have no doubt once Abi can speak English and begins playing LEGOs with him, they will become good friends.<br />

As with anything, Abi's adjustment will take time and patience, but she is doing so well already learning to live in a family and learning to love us. &nbsp;For only being home ten days, I'm quite encourages with her progress, even the moments of grief, moping or tantrums. &nbsp;They are totally expected and need to happen in order for future healthy relationships with us to occur.</div>

"event","""How are you adjusting?"" That's the most frequent question I get lately. <br />
<br />
My answer is, ""how do you expect we're adjusting?"" We added a 3yo who doesn't speak English to our household. <br />
<br />
Some moments are beautiful, like when she throws her arms around me and tells me that she loves me, or dances around at the prospect of a ride in the car. <br />
<br />
Mostly, it's pure survival mode. She still wakes up at 5am and wakes Bean and the rest of us. Bean is in full-swing jealous mode all of the time. He doesn't give us a break from being as grouchy and naughty as he can think of. Mister whines; Curly tries to help and ends up breaking eggs, spilling juice, getting marker everywhere... You get the picture. <br />
<br />
My day is survived moment to moment. I try to take delight in full meals eaten and imaginative stories in between scolding Bean for eating a toy, or banning Mister from the iPod. <br />
<br />
In two months, we'll have more communication, and we'll be able to go to the park again. Until then, I'll do my best to keep the LEGOs out of the toilet!<br />

Leaving the orphanage, I took Abi to the guesthouse where we both took a long nap. &nbsp;I expected her to be scared, but she loved all the staff (the feeling was entirely mutual) and loved exploring her new surroundings.&nbsp;</div>

<span style=""text-align: center;"">Because she was so hesitant walking around, I gave her the kiddie cane I'd brought for her and showed her how to use it. &nbsp;She understood right away what it was for, and understood that she could use it to walk around by herself, so she LOVED it! &nbsp;We had so much fun, I forgot to take very many pictures.</span><br />

On Tuesday, we went to the American embassy building. &nbsp;It had been closed for the holiday the day before, so the lines to get in were unusually long. &nbsp;We stood next to families scented with hopefulness, under a television screen with idyllic scenes of American life, like the Statue of Liberty and small children with balloons. Officious-looking Ethiopian security guards in uniforms stood everywhere.<br />
<br />
One of the rules at the embassy was that you had to check your cell phone and camera. Obviously, I have no pictures of our visit there, but I remember sitting in a large, crowded waiting room with Abi on my lap. &nbsp;She got bored, and began singing at the top of her lungs, ""Leeeeessss, Dzeeezuz Lubs Meeeeeeeeee!"" (Yes, Jesus Loves Me) and dropping her LEGOs on the floor.<br />
<br />
At last our name was called, and we walked to a window in a row of windows, behind which a blonde American man in his 20's shuffled through my paperwork and asked me a few questions. &nbsp;The interview took ten minutes. &nbsp;We'd waited in line almost 2 hours.<br />

While driving around Addis, our driver Yosef was so delighted that I was learning Amharic that he took it upon himself to be my own personal Tutor In Advanced Amharic. &nbsp;My memories of driving are punctuated with him saying ""What is Amharic for pencil? You don't remember? I tell you yesterday. Do you remember Wednesday? Heh-rohb! Very good! Wow, not many Americans speak Amharic.""<br />

While we were there, the city geared up for the Holy Day of Epiphany. &nbsp;All week, workmen climbed poles to hang colorful flags across the streets where the procession of the faithful would pass. &nbsp;As the Day approached, the traffic became even more crowded than before as people from the country came into the city for the celebration.<br />
<br />
Yosef, who is Orthodox, said that he was fasting by eating no meat, only Injera (a crepe-like flat bread) and Shiro-Wat (a red-lentil stew) but no meat. On the Friday of Epiphany, his family would eat Doro-Wat (a spicy chicken stew with a hard-boiled egg in it) to celebrate the Holy Day.<br />

On Wednesday, I shopped in the little ""souks"" or stalls for souvenirs to take home. Traditional clothes and a ""jebena"" or coffee pot all found their way into my overpacked suitcase. &nbsp;I also got some traditional incense to use in a coffee ceremony, although its crystalline appearance caught the attention of the TSA who thought it looked like drugs and slashed it open to check it, where it later filtered all through my suitcase and ruined a shirt. &nbsp;Good thing we live in a free country where personal property is respected (insert sarcasm here).</div>

Still, it was a fun, strange, week. &nbsp;Long hours of sitting around at the guesthouse, talking (Ethiopians love to do this) and getting to know Abi mingle in a blur with hours of driving in a hot car from here to there amid honking traffic and hundreds of thousands of people walking, walking, walking. &nbsp;Most people there walk, sometimes for miles, to work or shop, as driving is a luxury only the wealthiest can afford. &nbsp;Under the warm sun, no one hurried, but just walked. &nbsp;Some trudged; some walked with a spring in their steps. &nbsp;Some stopped to browse the shops as they passed, the shops with mannequins held captive against&nbsp;thievery&nbsp;by strings around their necks, or shops selling mattresses piled on the roof, or shops with baskets or bowls or stings of bananas. &nbsp;On one corner, a foosball table sat in the middle of a patch of dirt, while a group of boys used it for an animated game while an old man with a donkey watched. &nbsp;We passed a woman in a gray skirt using a pickaxe to dig a hole in the road. &nbsp;Women with beautifully braided hair held the hands of tiny children in green or purple school uniforms, while older children in the same colors played tag along the sides of the crowded street.<br /><br />I sat in the cocoon of my hired car and absorbed it all from behind the sheltering pane of glass that kept me forever separate from what I saw and heard and smelled. &nbsp;I tried to remember every face, every sign, every color, like the shop that sold only blue clothes or the shop that sold ""Passion Burgers."" I wanted to be able to tell Abi about the place she came from. &nbsp;I'd like to tell her about the rounded spires of the Orthodox churches and the undulating call of the&nbsp;muezzin as he calls the Muslims to pray. &nbsp;I'll tell her about the little shoe-shine boys and the green-and-yellow fences and the fluttering silks hanging from the roofs made of corrugated tin. &nbsp;I'll tell her about the way people would cross the street so close to your car that they would slap your hood as they passed. &nbsp;Maybe she will be able to see in her mind's eye the image of the old, bent holy men in their while hats and fluttering white robes as they pace along the dusty road in that ancient place. Even if she doesn't remember that city, I will never forget it.</div>

During Abi's first full day at home, she discovered the piano, just before it was time to go to bed.  She had so much fun exploring the notes, I had to take a little video of her.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<lj-embed id=""119""/>
<br />
<br />
She was singing in the video, a little song she has sung to us before.  It's in Amharic, and we didn't know what it was about for sure, although, we knew it was her favorite song.

<br />
<br />
This morning, I got this email from our social worker in Georgia:<br />

But, I got this email back from H today & thought I'd pass it on. She explains what it is that Abi is singing about when she was playing the piano. Thought you'd get a kick out of it!<br />
<br />
<pre style=""font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"">Thanks B for sharing this. We couldn't stop smiling looking at her and listening to what she is singing in the video. At first she was naming alphabets as u could hear it and then she called number 1-3 then the singing starts <span class=""yiv281628522moz-smiley-s1"" title="":)""></span> She was singing a spiritual song that tells that she is giving a praise for her Lord and she was inviting for anyone who has great God like hers to praise God. She was singing that devil can't make her stop from singing and praising her God. Hope this helps a little for her family to understand that she is singing and praising her Lord. FYI Abebech is really known in her room for her singing while she was in KVI. Her nannies always invite her to sing for others.

Thanks again,
H</pre>

A week ago was Martin Luther King Jr. day in America. &nbsp;In Addis, although the American Embassy was closed to observe the holiday, the Ethiopians were preparing for Epiphany by hanging colorful banners above the roads.

They played with her and hugged her, and told her that Jesus loves her. &nbsp;Although she won't remember them, their contribution to her life will last for the rest of her years.<br />

&#8226; Citi May Be Planning 15,000 Job Cuts
&#8226; Housing Data Sends Stocks Lower

Americans not only bought homes they couldn't afford, they also spent money they didn't have on Harleys.

In a note on Wednesday, Edward Aaron, an analyst for RBC Capital Market, said that Harley-Davidson (nyse: HOG - news - people )'s financial unit has seen increased delinquencies and losses on loans given out over the past few years.

One reason for that phenomenon, he said, is the same reason that the subprime lenders are in financial turmoil -- that is -- they lent money to risky borrowers.

""While we don't know which borrowers are accounting for the acceleration of loss rates in Harley's loan securitizations, it's stands to reason that the lower credit quality customer's would be accounting for most of that change,"" he said.

That doesn't mean Harley is on the verge of implosion, Aaron said in an interview. But it may cause the motorcycle company's earnings to sputter over the next few years.

Another reason for the increased delinquencies and losses on loans is a greater level of supply, which have caused bikes to depreciate.

""We are concerned that a lackluster rate of underlying demand growth in the U.S. has been marked to some extent by increased supply and credit exposure,"" he said in the report.

Aaron reduced his price target on the company to $61 from $71.

Last week, subprime lenders came under more pressure from investors after New Century Financial (nyse: NEW - news - people ) said it would stop lending to potential borrowers because it no longer has money to do so.

BERLIN: The International Monetary Fund will say <b>further depreciation by the U.S. dollar is needed</b> to help correct global imbalances in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), Germany&#8217;s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said on Saturday. 

Quoting from a draft of the WEO, the paper said the Washington-based fund argued &#8220;extraordinarily aggressively&#8221; for a correction in exchange rates, above all so as to reduce the massive U.S. current account deficit. 

The dollar, which slid to a 2-year low against the euro last week, should continue to depreciate in the mid-term, while the yen, the Chinese yuan and currencies of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East should all appreciate, the draft WEO said. 

The WEO, which is due to be published in mid-April, will add that there is no great need for further interest rate increases by the European Central Bank, according to the paper. 

Thanks to solid growth in the 13-nation euro zone, the ECB would not create problems by raising its main lending rate to about 4.0 percent from 3.75 percent at present, the IMF said. Reuters

List of Attendees Copped by AFP; Trilats Push for Higher Gas Taxes

By James P. Tucker Jr.

BRUSSELS&#8212;<b>America should impose a $1-pergallon increase in the gasoline tax as penance for causing pollution, John Deutch, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency, told the Trilateral Commission&#8217;s secret meeting here. </b>

When the TC called on the United States to increase gas taxes by 10 cents at a meeting in Tokyo in 1991, The Washington Post, which is always represented at TC and Bilderberg meetings, called for such an increase in an editorial the following day.

&#8220;The United States must adopt a carbon monoxide control policy,&#8221; Deutch said.

If the United States or any country in the Organization for Economic Development &#8220;that is a large producer of greenhouse gas emissions is to retain a leadership role in other areas, it cannot just opt out of the global climate change policy process.&#8221;

Deutch is most remembered for taking classified secrets home in his laptop, which led to the loss of his security clearance.

Later, CIA techies found that Deutch had been using the same computer, which contained national secrets, to surf the internet for pornography. The attorney general at the time, Janet &#8220;Butcher of Waco&#8221; Reno, declined to prosecute him.

The TC* got a ringing &#8220;chins up&#8221; about the pace of Europe&#8217;s becoming a superstate while greatly expanding its efforts to establish an &#8220;Asian-Pacific Union&#8221; similar to the European Union and its planned &#8220;American Union&#8221; covering the entire Western Hemisphere.

The ultimate goal of internationalist groups like the Trilateral-Bilderberg cabal is to divide the world into three great regions for the profit of the international plutocratic mattoids running the show.

Even in its own literature, the Trilateral Commission plays up the part that it was formed in 1973 by private citizens of Japan, Europe and North America to foster &#8220;closer cooperation&#8221;&#8212;today, that means globalization&#8212;among these industrialized regions. Since that time, the group meets throughout the year to discuss ways in which the group can advance world government.

An important weapon in their arsenal is fanning public hysteria over &#8220;global warming.&#8221;

But first, Peter Sutherland, TC&#8217;s European chairman, Bilderberg leader, former member of the European Commission and chairman of British Petroleum, lifted their spirits with assurances that a European constitution&#8212;the final step toward making the entire continent including Britain into a single nation&#8212;would be ratified. TC and Bilderberg had fretted about this since a draft had been rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005. The problem, he said, was letting people vote on the issue instead of having the proposed constitution approved by bureaucrats.

&#8220;There is a subdued mood in Europe for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, the precursor of the European Union,&#8221; Sutherland said. &#8220;But the achievements are indeed remarkable . . . the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital has transformed Europe. The effort succeeded because the integration process is based on a sharing of sovereignty and a method of governance that has challenged the traditional competences of the nation-state.&#8221; 

However, Sutherland remarked, &#8220;the decision by [British Prime Minister] Tony Blair to hold a referendum . . . set off a train of events that has plunged Europe into a crisis of confidence about the future that is not warranted. After all, 18 countries, some by referendum, have taken all steps to ratify the treaty and of the rest, a significant majority could do so tomorrow without difficulty.&#8221;

Since the 2005 rejection, countries from the former Soviet bloc and Iron Curtain countries have joined the union and would have to ratify. 

Sutherland&#8217;s message was clear: <b>a new, shorter constitution must be proposed and ratified without the voters.</b> His comments were also reflected in his commentary in the March 17 International Herald Tribune, which is published by the Bilderberg-controlled New York Times.

There was no mention that, at the same moment, he was attending the TC meeting. An independent source confirmed that the commentary was the text of his TC speech. A universal battle cry arose for the world to address &#8220;global warming&#8221; with a single voice. This issue is also a source of big bucks for these sons of smokestack industrialists.

One of those voices belonged to &#8220;the General Lord Guthrie,&#8221; director of N.M. Rothschild & Sons, member of the House of Lords and former chief of the Defense Staff in London. 

&#8220;We must address the global climate crisis with a single voice, and <b>impose rules that apply worldwide</b>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Otherwise, our children and children&#8217;s children will endure starvation and unimaginable hardship. We cannot address this crisis as 180 separate nation-states. <b>We must act as a single world state</b>.&#8221;

America&#8217;s TC leaders are growing old and frail, and another generation is being prepared. Founder David Rockefeller is 90 and in poor health. His nephew, Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), a lineal descendant of John the Original, attended the TC for the first time in many years.

Familiar American faces included former House Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.), former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, assistant to President Jimmy Carter for national security Zbigniew Brzezinski, former House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.); former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle, former Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

Newcomers included Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), former Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) and Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.). <b>All congressmen and senators were in violation of a federal law prohibiting public officials from attending secret meetings with private citizens to discuss public policy. </b>They also traveled at taxpayers&#8217; expense, and they do not fly coach.

Embattled AG now accused in sex scandal 'cover-up'
<a href=""http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54861"" target=""_new"">Attorney General Gonzales among officials who allegedly ignored abuse of minor boys</a>
Posted: March 25, 2007
9:49 p.m. Eastern

By Jerome R. Corsi
&#169; 2007 WorldNetDaily.com

Attorney General Alberto Gonzales

Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton, both already under siege for other matters, are now being accused of failing to prosecute officers of the Texas Youth Commission after a Texas Ranger investigation documented that guards and administrators were sexually abusing the institution's minor boy inmates.

<b>Among the charges in the Texas Ranger report were that administrators would rouse boys from their sleep for the purpose of conducting all-night sex parties.</b>

Ray Brookins, one of the officials named in the report, was a Texas prison guard before being hired at the youth commission school. As a prison guard, Brookins had a history of disciplinary and petty criminal records dating back 21 years. He retained his job despite charges of using pornography on the job, including viewing nude photos of men and women on state computers.

The Texas Youth Comission controversy traces back to a criminal investigation conducted in 2005 by Texas Ranger Brian Burzynski. The investigation revealed key employees at the West Texas State School in Pyote, Texas, were systematically abusing youth inmates in their custody.

Burzynski presented his findings to the attorney general in Texas, to the U.S. Attorney Sutton, and to the Department of Justice civil rights division. From all three, Burzynski received no interest in prosecuting the alleged sexual offenses.


""This case demonstrates that a partisan political agenda, with Karl Rove in an orchestrating role, has penetrated the Justice Department and subverted fair-minded administration of the law,"" Matt Angle, director of the Lone Star Project, told WND.

It's just the latest controversy for Sutton, Gonzales and the Bush administration's direction of the Justice Department. Earlier, Sutton's decisions to prosecute two Border Patrol agents and Deputy Sheriff Gil Hernandez were criticized as having been influenced by the intervention of the Mexican government.

Gonzales is under heavy congressional pressure in the controversy over the recent forced resignations of eight U.S. attorneys. At issue is whether the Bush administration is directing the Justice Department to pursue politically motivated prosecutions at the expense of fair or even-handed law enforcement.

<b>In the Texas Youth Commission scandal, Texas Ranger official Burzynski received a July 28, 2005, letter from Bill Baumann, assistant U.S. attorney in Sutton's office, declining prosecution on the argument that under 18 U.S.C. Section 242, the government would have to demonstrate that the boys subjected to sexual abuse sustained ""bodily injury."" Baumann wrote that, ""As you know, our interviews of the victims revealed that none sustained 'bodily injury.'""

Baumann's letter continued, adding a definition of the phrase ""bodily injury,"" as follows: ""Federal courts have interpreted this phrase to include physical pain. None of the victims have claimed to have felt physical pain during the course of the sexual assaults which they described.""</b>

Baumann's letter further suggested that insufficient evidence existed to prove the offenders in the Texas Youth Commission case had used force in their alleged acts of pedophilia: ""A felony charge under 18 U.S.C. Section 242 can also be predicated on the commission of 'aggravated sexual abuse' or the attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse. The offense of aggravated sexual abuse is proven with evidence that the perpetrator knowingly caused his victim to engage in a sexual act (which can include contact between the mouth and penis) by using force against the victim or by threatening or placing the victim in fear that the victim (or any other person) will be subjected to death, serious bodily injury or kidnapping. I do not believe that sufficient evidence exists to support a charge that either Brookins or Hernandez used force to cause victims to engage in a sexual act.""

Baumann's letter went so far as to suggest that the victims may have willingly participated in, or even enjoyed, the acts of pedophilia involved: ""As you know, consent is frequently an issue in sexual assault cases. Although none of the victims admit that they consented to the sexual contact, none resisted or voiced any objection to the conduct. Several of the victims suggested that they were simply 'getting off' on the school administrator.""

Baumann's letter also rejected Burzynski's charges that the administrators at the Texas Youth Commission facility in West Texas had used their position of authority to force the inmates to participate in the sexual acts or that the administrators had lengthened the sentences of the boys to retain willing participants or punish those reluctant to participate.

Baumann wrote: ""In order for the government to be successful in a criminal prosecution, it would be essential for us to show that the victim was in fact victimized. Most of the victims were aware of the power that the school principal and assistant superintendent held over them, but none were able to describe retaliative acts committed by either the principal or assistant superintendent. Although it is apparent that many students were retained at West Texas State School long after their initial release date, it would be difficult to prove that either Mr. Brookins or Mr. Hernandez prevented their release.""

On Sept. 27, 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division declined prosecution in a letter written to Lemuel Harrison, the Texas Youth Commission superintendent at the West Texas State School.

In that letter, Justice Department section chief Albert Moskowitz wrote that ""evidence does not establish a prosecutable violation of the federal criminal civil rights statutes.""

Angle maintains the decision not to prosecute was purely political.

""The U.S. attorney's office in Texas actually prepared indictments in this case,"" Angle told WND. ""But when the word came from Washington, that's when Baumann wrote his letter declining prosecution. Sutton's office dropped the matter on the desk of the local district attorney, but nobody from Sutton's office said 'if you can&#8217;t go on this case, we'll help you out.'""

WND asked Angle to explain how politics drove the decisions not to prosecute.

""If you read the letters from Sutton's office or from DOJ, it's really amazing what abuse they describe and then downplay as not being serious,"" Angle explained. ""They describe systematic and widespread abuse of juveniles who were held in these facilities by the people who were administering these facilities, and they acknowledge this fully, yet they determine that the evidence is not sufficient to warrant federal prosecution.""

Angle explained to WND that he found both letters shocking.

""The letters justify not pursuing these cases because, number one, there is no evidence that any of these juveniles felt physical pain while they were being assaulted, and the letters use the word 'assaulted,'"" he said. ""And then also, they rejected prosecution because none of these juveniles stated in the investigations that they resisted and objected, which of course the facts of the report show to be the case. This case developed right in the middle of Governor Perry's 2006 re-election campaign. While Texas is a Republican state, and the Republicans expected to win, still at that time, Governor Perry was facing an election challenge from Carole Strayhorn, a third party candidate who was also a former Republican comptroller in Texas.""

He continued: ""I would speculate that the political powers in Texas and Washington in the Republican Party were not interested in this sex scandal coming to light. Sutton and Gonzales let their political responsibilities outstrip their legal responsibilities, and as a result you had children who were in danger of sexual abuse and were left in that danger.""

Angle says that while the U.S. Justice Department and Texas attorney general's office were not prosecuting in this case, they were actively pursuing minor voter fraud issues with only a handful of allegations to go on.

On March 2, 2007, Governor Rick Perry appointed Jay Kimbrough, his former staff chief and homeland security director, to serve as ""special master"" to lead an investigation into the Texas Youth Commission sex abuse scandal. Shortly thereafter, the commission stopped a hiring practice that had allowed convicted felons to work as administrators in the system. The practice had involved a requirement that prior criminal records be destroyed for employees hired by the commission.

On March 17, 2007, the entire Texas Youth Commission governing board resigned.

The Texas Youth Commission is the state's juvenile corrections agency, charged ""with the care, custody, rehabilitation, and reestablishment in society of Texas' most chronically delinquent or serious juvenile offenders."" Inmates are felony-level offenders<b> between the age of 10 and 17 </b>when they are committed. The commission can maintain jurisdiction over offenders until their 21st birthdays.

The Lone Star Project is organized as a political research and policy analysis project of the Lone Star Fund, a federal political action committee organized in Texas. The Lone Star Project has aggressively investigated alleged political abuses within the Texas Republican Party, including playing a leading role in investigating the activities of former Rep. Tom DeLay in the redistricting controversy in Texas.

Bill Baumann was the lead prosecutor in another controversial case. In a case eerily reminiscent of the controversial jailing of Border Patrol agents Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos while the illegal-alien drug-smuggler they wounded went free, Texas Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez is imprisoned for a year for an altercation with illegal aliens. Baumann urged he get the maximum seven-year sentence.

But, even I tire of gloom and doom. Further proof that New Hamster is one of the last bastions of sanity. 

<a href=""http://www.seacoastonline.com/news/special/032107special3.htm"" target=""_new"">N.H. committee backs REAL ID ban</a>

By Norma Love 
Associated Press

CONCORD, N.H. - The New Hampshire Legislature took a baby step Tuesday toward rejecting what they say amounts to the creation of a national ID card.

The House Transportation Committee voted unanimously to recommend barring the state from complying with the federal REAL ID Act, which sets standards for driver's licenses. The full House next considers the bill.

Rep. Sherman Packard, R-Londonderry, said Congress went too far in passing the law.

""We have to uphold the constitution,"" he said. ""We will not be blackmailed by the federal government.""

Committee Chairman Jim Ryan, a Franklin Democrat, said New Hampshire needs to send a clear statement that ""we believe the federal government has strayed too far.""

Last year, New Hampshire led the way in opposing the law _ a move now being considered by other states.

Earlier this month, President Bush bowed to pressure from the nation's governors and Congress and granted states until Dec. 31, 2009, to comply. Two years ago, Congress set a deadline for states to comply with uniform licensing standards by May 2008.

The law passed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It requires all states to bring their driver's licenses under a national standard and to link their record-keeping systems. States must verify identification used to obtain a driver's license, such as birth certificates, Social Security numbers and passports.

Driver's licenses not meeting the standard won't be accepted as identification to board a plane and enter federal buildings.

At a hearing last week, opponents argued the law was too intrusive. They also said the risk was too great that thieves would gain access to information needed to steal people's identities if a national database was created.

In January, Maine lawmakers adopted a nonbinding resolution opposing the law.

Rep. Neal Kurk, R-Weare, the prime sponsor of New Hampshire's bill, says 26 states have either legislation or resolutions in the works opposing REAL ID. He said 11 states have legislation facilitating compliance _ some of which also have measures opposing the act.

Last year, New Hampshire's House voted against participating and Gov. John Lynch said he would sign the bill, but the Senate rejected it. New Hampshire also was one of two states picked to pilot the program, but Lynch and the Executive Council did not approve the $3 million grant.

Last month, Lynch reiterated his concerns that too many questions remained about the cost, privacy and turning motor vehicle workers into de facto agents of Homeland Security. He said implementing the federal identity system could cost New Hampshire tens of millions of dollars.

Lynch reiterated Tuesday he would sign the bill if it reaches his desk.

Did someone say ""moon rocket?""

My oh my, the speed with which China's space program has progressed. How did they do that so fast, I wonder. They can even knock out satellites!

Why they might even decide to challenge the space superiority of the US. Or maybe they already have.

Or they could just disable our computer chips. You know... the ones <i>they made for us.</i>

Let's not forget that China allows foreign companies to manufacture goods within their borders ONLY IF you form a ""joint venture"" with the Chinese in order to manufacture there. 

""The U.S. is one of China's primary suppliers of power-generating equipment, aircraft and parts, computers and industrial machinery, raw materials, and chemical and agricultural products. However, U.S. exporters continue to have concerns about fair market access due to China's restrictive trade policies and U.S. export restrictions. Intellectual property theft makes many Western companies wary of doing business in mainland China. Some Western politicians and manufacturers also say the value of the Yuan is artificially low and gives export from mainland China an unfair advantage. These and other issues are behind the recent push for greater protectionism by some in the US Congress, including a 27.5% consumer tax on imports.""

GM, Ford, and others... you think you have problems <i>now.</i> 

I prefer chicken flavored Ramen, so I guess the question for me is, should I learn to say ""I for one welcome our Chinese overlords!"" in Cantonese or Mandarin?"

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Commodities investment guru Jim Rogers stepped into the U.S. subprime fray on Wednesday, predicting a real estate crash that would trigger defaults and spread contagion to emerging markets.

""You can't believe how bad it's going to get before it gets any better,"" the prominent U.S. fund manager told Reuters by telephone from New York.

""It's going to be a disaster for many people who don't have a clue about what happens when a real estate bubble pops.

""It is going to be a huge mess,"" said Rogers, who has put his $15 million belle epoque mansion on Manhattan's Upper West Side on the market and is planning to move to Asia."

"event","Interesting times. 

Mander pander poked me and said I should say something, and I suppose she's right...

I moved into my new house (new to me anyway - built in 1956 it's actually the newest house I've ever bought and lived in.) It's old enough to be characterful (and dare I say, a little odd) but new enough that modern things added to it don't contrast starkly. Plus, first time I've owned a garage of any sort, and the Bayerische conveyances both fit, albeit slightly awkwardly. It is a one-car garage, after all. It even has a rolly-up door. With windows! But not Windows(TM) because I draw the line at crappy software. (OK OK I have a MySpace account but it's because I was pressured into it.) 

Heck, I even have a hot tub/jacuzzi bathtub thingy. No... really. With squirty jets and everything. Just the ticket for mild hydrophobes. (Female readers - I don't actually have it, I'm lying, please don't show up with towel in hand. I'm a big fat liar. Seriously. I'm big and fat and I lie.)

Now don't go carryin' pictures of Chairman Mao or anything, but I signed up with Green Mountain Energy (purveyors of water and wind generated electricity) for power, and I got me some of those compact flourescent bulbs to replace all the incandescents. So far I've replaced 14 60-watters with 13-watters. Math is hard, but I can spot savings. 

I can also spot insanity, and if oil is so precious that we'll kill for it, die for it, and save it up in strategic supplies... I suppose it's a good ideer to maybe conserve where we can, no? I know, I'm unamerican. Future plans include solar cells, batteries and transformers, and a wind turbine. My neighbors are going to loooooove me. Am I going green? Well sort of. Green as in ""oil is only going to go up, making everything more expensive, and I'm not 100% sure this country is going to remain solvent, let alone stable."" Ok maybe that's not green. But it is forward-thinking. I also intend to give Mountain House and perhaps Alpine Air some of my money, and if you don't know who that is, it's OK. Those of you who do... you're probably way ahead of me. Don't get me started on my new precious metals collection, either. 

I'm about 90% settled and so far have been too busy (or lazy, or something) to unpack those last few boxes. You know... the ones with the crap that you have no idea where they should go. I think a trip to Lowe's for more baker's racks is in order - they have swell shelving of that sort for cheep. (Target is hit or miss on their selection, and the last Chinese slave-built armoire I got there is, in fact, the last Chinese slave-built thing I'll ever buy if I can help it.) Oh and if anyone knows where I can get compact fluorescent bulbs that are NOT made in China I'd sure appreciate it. I could use the ""series of tubes"" and The Google(TM) and buy stuff online, I guess, if I could determine where the stuff I want is made - not as easy as you think, see Chinese slave goods commentary above. 

No cable TV for me anymore, though. Hrmm, purchase a product (paid for monthly, at a cost that could be better put into savings or my IRA or, god forbid, BOOKS) that encourages me to do nothing for hours at a stretch, or pocket the savings and get my life back? Gee whiz, what should I do...  

As far as my state of ""wellness"" I suppose that's anyone's guess. Recently, I performed what I saw as my duties and did that until I was drained, and haven't really filled up again. I suppose you could say that I feel more than a little dead inside, but I don't want to have to scrape out the dead cells and, you know, ""deal with stuff"" anytime real soon. I think I'd be better served by relaxing as much as possible. That's my main problem anyway, I tend to wind up over time until I'm almost rigid. Tough luck, big pharma... I don't want your pills. I think I'll just get one of Dr. Nick's swell earthpulse.com devices, and synchronize my brain or somesuch. What could possibly go wrong? 

I still have to get a dryer (I have a washer - but no dryer. Not real handy) which I should be able to pick up from Mike The Drummer For Matt White - he has 2 dryers and a washer, hoarder of clothes-processors that he is.  (His house came with a dryer, but no washer... people! These things are meant to be PAIRED.) 

LOL; lol.

Once I get my mitts on the kitchen table & chairs from Uncle Bob's House of Storage Stuff (you know who you are - and ok it is my fault but only recently have I stopped being ridiculously busy, don't h8 yo), and bother to clean up the last of the boxes, then indeed I shall (as has been suggested) have a housewarming of sorts. You're invited! Because you make yummy food, don't you. Oh yes you do. And you have to bring it over.

"event","Long ago, the great Frith made the world. He made all the stars, and the Earth lived among the stars. He made all the animals and birds, and at first, he made them all the same. 

Now, among the animals in these days was El-Ahrairah, the prince of rabbits. He had many friends, and they all ate grass together. But after a time, the rabbits wandered everywhere, multiplying and eating as they went. Then Frith said to El-Ahrairah, 'Prince Rabbit, if you cannot control your people, I shall find ways to control them.' But El-Ahrairah would not listen. He said to Frith, 'My people are the strongest in the world.' 

This angered Frith, and he determined to get the better of El-Ahrairah. And so, he gave a present to every animal and bird, making each one different from the rest. When the fox came, and others, like the dog, and cat, hawk, and weasel, to each of them, Frith gave a fierce desire to hunt and kill the children of El-Ahrairah.

"event","<i>Sports group stops raffle with gun prize
Associated Press

WEAVERVILLE, N.C. - A youth athletic association stopped the sale of raffle tickets for an Uzi submachine gun after parents complained that the tickets were being sold at a concession stand.

Gary Chandler, commissioner of the North Buncombe Youth Athletic Association, said his group didn't approve the raffle tickets, which were sold Saturday during football practice at North Buncombe Park.

""It was a parent who was doing soliciting out in the community,"" Chandler said. ""This individual or parent did not think it through.""

With a few exceptions, it is illegal to possess a machine gun.</i>

*sigh*

1) Raffling off guns is nothing new, I bought raffle tickets from a local high school a couple months ago where one of the prizes was a Benelli shotgun. This is not news. In fact I'm disappointed I didn't win the shotgun, or the Xbox, or anything for that matter. 

2) Personally, I can't confirm one way or another that this Uzi was in fact full-auto. It could have been a semi, easily... the press is notorious for getting this detail wrong ""accidentally."" If it was a full on full-auto Uzi, then whoever was raffling it off had damned well better have been asking for $100 a ticket or more. Those things don't come cheap and they're not a lot of fun to federally transfer, not to mention the fact that it has to be a 1986 or older model to even be transferrable to civilian hands. Plus, they're increasingly rare because civilians can't get anything newer than 1986 models, so the prices are RIDICULOUS. I think they're literally worth their weight in gold. If I had to guess, I'd say it was a semi, and probably one of the ugly useless 16-inch barrel models. Not much of a prize, there are far better carbines to be had. 

3) It used to be that nobody cared who procured what gun in NC because we all pretty much had guns, and we all knew it, and we were by and large a polite society. When I went to summer camp as a kid, we practiced shooting with rifles and had a tournament at the end of our stay (which I always won.) No freakouts, no injuries, no AP stories, nothing. My how things have changed. ""Not news"" becomes news, if you put a perfectly legal gun in it. ""Ice cream being sold at the GUN SHOW! Children lured to GUN VIOLENCE! Film at 11.""  

4) Hey AP: With a few exceptions, it is <b>quite legal</b> to possess a ""machine gun."" It is, however, quite a hassle. And next time if you'd be so kind as to tell me about it while I can still buy a raffle ticket, I'd appreciate it."

But it leads me to provocative nuggets like this one:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods

""According to James Bamford in Body of Secrets:

    Operation Northwoods, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing, they needed to launch their war. ""

Huh. Sounds familiar... and those videos of the Pentagon getting hit by something just... never really show a plane. For, uh, whatever reason. 

I don't know if this is really really true... it is Wikipedia on the internets, after all. However, I don't think it runs against the grain of our government to do something of this type. And that makes me sad. 

I know, historically, that we've done bad, government-sponsored things to our populace. Wiki again, but I've seen other sources. Wiki's just convenient. This I do for you, the dear reader. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKULTRA (I think Rummy & Cheney were in on this one too, based on some stuff I saw on the good ol' TV.) 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzanar_Japanese_Internment_Camp

Here's one of my favorites - the forced government ""purchase"" (paid confiscation, really, as it wasn't optional) of privately held gold. FDR at work again. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102

It utterly, utterly baffles me that anyone would want, in any way, to <b>expand</b> the power of our government, when at every turn it demonstrates that it abuses the power it already has, and is hungry for more."

So I'd gone home over lunch to check that my new Michelin tires had been delivered. FedEx has been, shall we say, less than 100% successful in delivering things to me of late, so I felt that it was important to check. 

Tires arrived, so I put them in my little q-hut and headed back to work. On the way back through downtown, I spotted a crusty at the bus stop ahead, in fashionable ""fresh mud brown,"" clutching a guitar. When a guy on a bicycle went by the crusty, the crusty gesticulated wildly and gave huge exaggerated ""thumbs-down"" motions to the cyclist as he rode past.

Being me, I decided to gather another data point. I moved from the left lane over to the right lane so that I, too, could go by the crusty. I wondered what he'd do if a motorcycle went past. 

Well, sure enough, I got the crazy gesticulations and thumbs-down. Oddly though, the crusty had accosted both of us silently. I would have thought there would have been some good ol' hollerin' to go with the frantic display of disapproval. Two wheels bad! Anyway... 

The USGP is this weekend, so tune in your cable boxes. If you miss it, ABC will whow their coverage the following weekend. Current theory on the R1 board is that Rossi's unearthly talent is, in fact, unearthly... because he's really an alien (blowing Scott's ""why aren't they here yet"" theory all to pieces.)

Sean Johnson, you were just a flat-out good guy. Fun and funny, we always had good times. I haven't seen you for years. I guess I'm not likely to, either. It's unfair but so is life and you knew that... but you had fun anyway. Go easy bro. 

I love cars and bikes and things that go fast but... I've lost so many people to the devices. No, I'm not going to have a knee-jerk ""ban cars"" reaction. It suuure would be nice if we had better driver training in this country though.

Anyway.  He died abruptly, I'm dying slow... or so says my oh-so-fancy new scale. It tells me All The Things(TM) and the combined data says that I have pretty much fucked up my health real extra good. 

I'm not past the point of no return, or at least I don't think so. Saw a lot of Discovery Health stuff about morbidly obese people. According to them I'm morbidly obese; however I am in no way a bed-ridden, sore-covered pancake person and don't intend to become one. I don't know if the pancake people intended to become pancake people, either... 

I considered posting the figures here but... frankly I'm embarrassed to. 

I'm still alive, unlike others I once knew. To me, that means I need to make the most of what's left of my life. I think no longer being classified as morbidly obese would be a good start."

It's bad when your vision is so blurry in the morning that the digital clock's readout looks like 8:45 but it's really 9:45, and it's darker than normal outside which doesn't help. *ahem*

Oh, and the iPod Shuffle isn't mine, the guy at Jamba Juice gave it to me so I could listen to the new Tool album. It's nerd-style heavy rock basically... mixed meter = nerd rock. Deal with it. 

Fable is fun but stressful. Should I marry Lady Grey? But she's a bitch! Tourist Trophy is a far more pure experience. You race bikes; you win, or lose, or crash. Throttle, brake, hang off or tuck under the bubble... that's pretty much it. You can wheelie too, and stoppie, and have spectacular crashes. I dig it. 

Supposedly my BMW wagon is on its way from Colorado to Austin via truck. When it arrives is anyone's guess. I'll take peektures when it gets here. 

I'm thinking about going kart racing- I have to gather more details but it sounds very do-able and relatively cheap. I'm also slooowly gathering gear for track time on the bike, and I got the full ""hold the warm puppy"" treatment at Lone Star 'cause I ended up seated on a brandy new Triumph Daytona 675 which is one holy hell of a bike. It's really pretty, it's sexy, it's light and sharp, and it accelerates like an R1 up to 120. Ye gods. I like the ""graphite"" one, mainly 'cause the ""scorched yellow"" looks like monkey pee and the red one, well... nothing says ""pull me over"" like a screaming red sportbike.

http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/04/17/spacecraft.mishap.ap/index.html

LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- Saying the information is too sensitive, NASA announced Friday that it will not release its report on the failed rendezvous of two spacecraft in what would have been the first such maneuver without human intervention.

NASA plans to release a summary of why the DART spacecraft did not complete its mission last year, but the full 70-page document contains details protected by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, space agency spokesman Michael Braukus said.

Launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in April 2005, the 800-pound Demonstration for Autonomous Rendezvous Technology spacecraft successfully located the Pentagon satellite it was to rendezvous with and flew within 300 feet of it.

Sucktacular. It was JUST YESTERDAY that I was thinking ""man, this phone has worked brilliantly. I wonder if I should back up all the numbers in it... naaah, it's all good.""

head --> desk --> repeat
 
phone = pone = pwn = OMGWTFLOLPWNXORED!!!!!111!!!eleven!!!!!~~~~~~~~~

Edit: OK, fine, sod it, this is why I have savings I guess. Now I get to go up to the Cingular store and wade through flaming tar pits of hell and beg someone to retrieve my data while I contemplate whether or not to continue service with Cingular, or move on to a different provider. 

But, I have to do this now now now, the celly is my only comm device and as I'm in the final stages of getting my car, I HAVE to have this working now now now. 

*clenches teeth in frustration*

Edit 2 Electric Boogaloo: I broke down and got the Razr V3, oooh so shiny pretty. I am now officially BMW owning, Mac using, Razr-toting yuppie scum. But at least I don't own a 9mm Glock. I think that would push me over the edge straight into Yuppie Demon of Starbuck's + 4."

"event","So it is that I reflect with fondness upon my misspent youth, wherein my old boss Jimbo P would tell me about the ""girl cars"" we had for sale, at the foreign car place I worked at in Raleigh. 

""Oh, this one's got all the toys... CD playah, sun-ruff, automatic transmission... it's such a guhl cah!"" (He was from Massachusetts.) 

Apparently, a car with lots of gadgets and an auto tranny is a ""girl car,"" but in this day and age, pretty much ALL cars have lots of ""toys"" and slushboxes. You have to do some research and be patient if you want to row your own anymore, and with regard to modern cars, you'd be hard pressed to get one without A/C, airbags, ABS, CD player, and power everything.  

However, the notion of a ""girl car"" came up again in conversation recently, so I'm going to proffer some truthiness about such things... and no, I didn't do any ""research,"" because ""facts"" get in the way of the TRUTH, you buncha liberals! ;) I'm defining ""girl car"" basically as ""a car I'm likely to see a girl in,"" which in no way denigrates females... it's just... you know... cars you see girls drive. 

Away we go... 

10 - Ford Mustang Coupe (1965-1968) - ""THIS CAR IS SO COOL!!!"" 

From Sissy in ""Urban Cowboy"" (remember how she'd park it, REV the engine, and immediately kill it? Every redneck I knew did the same thing) to Jude Harrison in ""Instant Star,"" the ladies love an old Mustang. I have a whooole lot of history with these cars, and though they're certainly not exclusively girl cars, I have to say... they get more than their fair share of estro-ttention, far moreso than their GM and Mopar equivalents. Basically, they look cool, they're simple and sporty, and fun to drive. Ford knew this from way back, when they first introduced the car, and had the famous ""Six and the single girl"" ad campaign to get ""secretaries"" (in their words) to buy the six-cylinder versions. Seriously. I guess it worked, they'd sold a million Mustangs by 1966 (2nd year of the model!) 

09 - Pretty much any domestic SUV - ""I am NOT a soccer mom! I swear!"" 

Favored heavily by soccer moms in denial, because they're NOT minivans (which they'd be much better off with) and because their bubba husbands insist on buying domestic. Always eyed suspiciously by motorcyclists because the pilot typically has a cell jammed in one ear while the tots leap around in the back like players in an online WWII shoot-em-up game. (Ask Rog.) It's essentially a way to pretend you're a rugged, sporty individual while you're buying pallets of Spaghetti-os from Sam's Club. 

08 - BMW 3-series - ""Daddy says I'M the best kisser!""***

The eternal choice of the spoiled princess. Possibly offering the least bang for the buck in the BMW lineup, the price point is tolerable for well-heeled daddies who wouldn't want their child seen in something as pedestrian as a Corolla, and who also realize that SUVs are sick creations from the pit of hell that will flip their precious princess into oblivion, given half the chance. It never fails to astonish me how YOUNG the girls who end up driving these things are, either... you can't get into a new BMW for less than 31 large, folks... and that's MSRP so call it 35.  Trips me out. 

07 - Volkswagen Jetta - ""Where's the Starbuck's?"" 

The #1 choice of Lincoln Park Trixies. Astonishing in their popularity and their ride harshness, this seems to be the vehicle of choice among the middle class gals with euro tastes. Distinctively styled (well, up until the current model, which looks like it took a trip through a Toyotafier) it's basically a Golf with a trunk. Essentially, a reasonably-priced transporation device with mildly sporty intentions, but nothing too scary or macho. Goldilocks would probably drive a Jetta. 

06 - Honda Civic - ""I hate driving, and it shows."" 

I admit, even though I'm something of a transportation enthusiast, there are days where I dread traffic. 'Cause, you know, commuting sucks, by and large. But what if you hate driving anywhere, at any time? If so, Honda has the car for you: a car for people who hate cars. Apparently engineered to eliminate any driving character, this car just takes you places, efficiently and blandly. It's the transportation equivalent of a toaster. As such, it is wildly popular with women who only have a car because you have to; in this country, it's damn near impossible to do without one. Sure, you can rod it out and make it raspy and quick, but 99.99% of owners will just drive it, and probably a good 30% will drive it 100,000+ miles with the oil that it came with from the factory. (You'd be surprised. Really.)

05 - TIE - Volvo Wagon/pretty much any minivan ever - ""I'm a soccer mom and I can live with it."" 

Yes, it's a tie, and SCREW YOU for questioning my infallible methodology! I have a certain respect for mommies who choose minivans - they know what their mission is and they picked the right tool for the job. SUVs have far less cargo capacity and ride on truck tires... minivans are caverns with good ride quality. It's an honesty of purpose that verges on punk rock. Volvo wagons, the minivan of the 70s, are another far more practical choice. Volvo, at one time, was THE scourge of the motorcyclist... apparently, people who think they're safe from harm in their cars stop caring about anyone else on the road, and it shows in their driving. Nowadays, the #1 scourge of bikers is the SUV, so the Volvo can return to being the sensible choice. Ladies in Volvos and minivans get the thumbs-up. By the way, it makes sense to me that the womenfolk would want a Volvo... take a close look at their logo sometime. :) 

04 - Infiniti FX35/45 - ""Ashley, Tyler.. stop kicking the back seat! Mommy's on the phone! I MEAN IT!!!"" 

This is sort of ""SUV, special case"" in my mind. I'm picking on them because, moreso than Acura MD-X's or Lexii, people who drive these seem to be HELL BENT on driving like cock gobblers. And you know... I'm actually a Nissan fan. But JESUS. I thought Porsche drivers were assholes... they got nothin' on the FXers. OK, yeah, your SUV is quick and FEELS sporty, but a high center of gravity is a high center of gravity. At some point you're going to twist the car into shiny, flaming Japanese origami that they can't extract your corpse from, for love nor money. Go back to Westlake and take your ridiculously-named children with you... and slow down!  

03 - TIE - Mazda Miata/BMW Z-roadster/Porsche Boxster - ""I always wanted a convertible...""

Another tie SHUT UP SHUT UP. I don't begrudge anyone for wanting these cars. They're sexy, sporty, and speak to many budget levels. Practical? Oh hell no. Pretty girls and convertibles go together like... chocolate and puppies. Or something. Oddly enough, the people who I hear raving about how cool these cars are... are guys. But I see girls driving them. It leads me to believe that these cars are probably at or near the top of the list for ""gift cars"" that guys buy for the ones they love. I rarely hear a woman rave about these cars. I always see them driving them, though, instead of guys. Then again, ladies are also less likely to kiss and tell, the crafty devils. :)  

02 - Volkswagen New Beetle - ""OMG it's so cute!!!"" 

This car is cuter than a puppy bucket of cute things, smothered in adorable sauce. It makes the old Neon look like a wharf rat. As a former Bug-head, I was enthused when VW announced that it would produce these things. I think, however, that I was more enamored of the concept than the reality. With shit for trunk space, rear headroom verging on the dangerous, and front headroom that the Cat in the Hat would enjoy, this is basically a Civic for quirky gals with a taste for fun and the slightly bizarre. Yeah, they could have bought a Golf. But this is just wackiness on four wheels. Comes in a wide range of pastel colors that only Germans would dare to create, including a wide assortment of Bauhaus greys. 

01 - Volkswagen Cabriolet - ""THE girl car."" 

There can be... only one. Why this is the ultimate girl car, I have no idea. But honest to Pete, no other car screams ""girl"" like this one. If you're a boy and you own one... you, sir, are rock-solid in your sexual orientation... whatever it might happen to be, because you're driving a GIRL CAR and there can be absolutely no denying it. Maybe it's because it's like having a Jetta and a Miata in one? I don't know. But if there exists more of a girl car than this, I have yet to see it. 

OK I'm done handing out my iron-clad logic now. Please enjoy, and feel free to make additions in the comments... it's a lot of fun in there!!!

"event","Just sitting here this morning in my favorite chair, listening to music and thinking about how thankful I am for my life right now.  I also noticed how the name of the song really kind of summed up a lot of my interests, and it made me laugh.   I just turned 40 about a week ago, and I am actually enjoying being 40.  It is my time now, and I am really loving making my own decisions and leading my own life.  I haven't posted here in a really long time, so I'll just catch up a few things that I'll journal about more later.

My son Gav is going into 6th grade this year.  I had to fight the school and the IEP team to let him move forward because they wanted to keep him back.  He is in summer program now for a few weeks, that is 9-noon, Monday through Thursday.  It isn't much, but at least I get three hours of peace.  When he is not in school, he is hanging around here, usually trying to pick a fight with me because I won't let him play his video games until he cleans up his room and does his laundry (which he hasn't done in weeks now).  So, it is his decision, and he's all out of joint because I keep telling him that as soon as he does it, he can have the games back.  All I know is that I have a *lot* more patience than he does, and if he never gets the PS2 back, it's okay with me.  lol

My disability was granted back in December, so I am finally getting a sense of some financial stability.  I am looking into improving my credit score so I can apply for a mortgage and buy my own house.  In the meantime, I am beginning my third year here in this apartment, which I love, but it's not mine to really decorate and fix as I like.

My singing career has taken some twists in the last year.  I quit the group that had the CDs out because of some personality and artistic differences, and although it was really hard to let go of that, I am now very glad I did.  It was far more stressful than I realized because I had gotten myself into a situation where I couldn't really be myself, and it wasn't fun anymore.  I wasn't getting anything out of it but stress and frustration, unfortunately, so I let it go.  In the meantime, I am now singing Madrigals professionally at renaissance faires in the New England area, and am absolutely LOVING IT!!!  Our group is called Myschyffe Managed, and this is our second year booking faires.  Our website is still under construction, but our pics and character bios are there at www.myschyffemanaged.com .  We are all great friends and we have a complete blast!  And, Gav loves running around with his wooden sword, challenging anyone and everyone to a swordfight.  lol  What better environment to raise a child who is always in a fantasy world, but to take him to events where all the adults are in their own fantasy world?  LOL!

I still attend the UU church in Manchester, but there have been some frustrating things there for me.  We now have no RE director (as a result of the annual meeting and us not being able to get everyone to vote for a higher hours and pay, our part time director has resigned), and we still have no choir or music department at all, except for me, the Music Director, which means that I schedule the accompanists.  <sigh>  I am completely flabbergasted that this fellowship thinks it is okay to not have a music program.  I understand that funds are limited, but in order to raise funds, we need to attract new members, and who in their right mind would attend a church with no music and no childcare?  Not to mention that I am the only single mom in the whole congregation.  Geez.

In my spare time, I am working on my degree in Metaphysics.  When I am finished, I will have a doctorate.  I am considering offering spiritual counseling services along with teaching classes and doing readings.  We'll see how that works out.  A local shop offered me a job reading Tarot, and I am considering it, but I haven't seriously pursued it.  Besides, with the disability, I can't earn much before it starts affecting my benefits.  I want to work on my channeling skills some more, and do some of the stuff that John Edward does on TV.  I have done that before spontaneously, for some people I am close to, but I want to learn to be able to do it more consistently.  Many of the classes I am taking for my degree are helping me to refine those skills, so I'll see where it takes me.

So, on a regular day, I enjoy taking care of the fish, the cats and the snake.  Our baby snake is getting so big, I can't believe it!  He just turned a year old, and I think he's put on a few inches since we got him and I first measured him at about 18"" long.  He is a cute little ball python named ""Apollo"" and I am surprised at how much I have grown to enjoy him.  At first I got him because Gav is fascinated with snakes, but he is kind of my pet now because I am the one who handles him and feed him, etc.  He is very calm and low key, and actually quite cute!  So, I put the cats behind a closed door and get Apollo out and play with him every once in awhile.  He likes looking for warm places, and will go under the hair at the back of my neck and just sit there.  It tickles, but I don't mind.  I always keep a hand on him so he can't get away and he stays safe.  Who knew I would enjoy having a snake so much?

I bought livebearers (Mollies) for my fishtank, thinking that it would be cool to breed them later on, but I found out pretty quickly that they were way ahead of me on that.  I think at least two of them were ready to pop when I bought them because within two weeks, I found teeny-tiny babies in there, trying not to get eaten by the adult fish!  I managed to save six of them and get them into a breeding net so they could be safe.  Two weeks later, I spotted some more that were so tiny, they almost looked like an eyelash!  So, now, I check very carefully every few days to see if there are any more that I have missed.  Luckily, I had put lots of plants in there, and I think they hide in there until they are big enough to mix with the bigger fish.  As long as they get enough to eat, I guess that's okay.  I have yet to figure out if I have male or female adults though, so I don't know if there will be more, or if I only bought females.  I am keeping the babies separated from the adults until I can tell who is what, so we don't wind up getting overwhelmed by teeny-tiny-fry!  They are cute as heck, but I only have a 29 gallon tank, and a 10 gallon tank...  and technically, I am not supposed to have any pets in here except for one cat that is specified in my lease.  Oh well.  They all keep me company during the day so I don't wind up talking to myself while Gav is at school.  

Three weeks ago, I finally, got up my nerve and went and got the tattoo I had been planning on for 15 years.  I went with friends, and it wasn't bad at all.  I designed it and worked with the artist to make it tattoo friendly, then went back and got it later.  I decided to give it to myself for my 40th birthday present.  It is an ""OM"" symbol in Sanskrit, filled with colored paisley designs, and centered in a lotus outline.  I am really happy with it, and I can't wait to get more!  Now I have 3 more planned and I just need to get to designing and saving my money!

I had this funny thing happen to me Thursday morning, which made me think I ought to post it here, to give you a bit of local NH small town flavor.  lol  I had to drop Gav off at school because he missed the bus, so on the way back home I stopped at the little grocery store across the street from my apartment, to get some cereal for breakfast.  The guy in line in front of me was probably in his 50s, a little heavyset, with a long grey beard and hair, and I could see some pretty interesting tattoos peeking out from under the white t-shirt and leather Harley vest.  The teenager at the register finished with the customer before him and said ""have a nice day"", as she finished the transaction.  He stepped up to the register and handed over his purchase and said, ""Don't tell me to have a nice day, I already made plans.""  The poor kid didn't know whether to poop or go blind (as my father would day), but he smiled a second later, and we all had a good chuckle over it.  When I went out to the car, I saw him sitting on his bike (motorcycle), finishing up his bakery-bought cinnamon buns, then he roared off into the mountains.  I just smiled and shook my head.  I love New Hampshire!"

"event","I haven't posted here in a long time, but I was talking to my friend onyxhealer a few minutes ago on the phone, and she asked if I was on LJ.&nbsp; I had been thinking about doing some more journaling lately, so that was the nudge I needed.&nbsp; Thanks girl!!!

In general, life has been pretty good to me lately.&nbsp; I am reading a *great* series of books right now by Christine Feehan.&nbsp; Anyone interested in vampire smut will love them.&nbsp; LOL!&nbsp; 

Goofnut is actually doing pretty well in his last few weeks of school and will be attending middle school next year!&nbsp; (middle school???&nbsp; How did *that* happen?)&nbsp; We are having all kinds of meetings with the special ed teams at the current school and at the new one, and hopefully we will be able to work out some good solutions for his benefit.&nbsp; I think we may have had a really good breakthrough with his therapist this week too.&nbsp; We may finally have a good grip on what he needs in an academic environment.&nbsp; Now we just need to figure out how to get it for him.&nbsp; 

I am currenly in appeal for my disability claim.&nbsp; Hopefully I can have my hearing by the end of the summer.&nbsp; In the meantime, I am picking up a little work doing genealogy by the hour, and may get a part-time position working at the church.&nbsp; My lawyer says it won't affect my claim, so I'm currently in talks with the personnel committee to see if it would work out for them and for me.&nbsp; 

In the meantime, I had one of those interesting moments of synchronicity on Thursday, when I was making calls for some of my own family history research, I got in contact with a nice man who is working on a project to restore a train that my great-grandfather was the engineer for before his retirement in 1954.&nbsp; After an hour and a half of very enjoyable conversation on that and many other subjects, we already had planned two occasions to see each other (having to do with the train project, of course).&nbsp; I couldn't help but wonder if this might be a way for the Universe to help me find Mr. Right.&nbsp; &nbsp; I just had a kind of feeling...&nbsp; Realistically, I don't know anything about him at all, even what he looks like.&nbsp; But, we did seem to make a connection during this call.&nbsp; I joked with my Mother about it the next day, and wasn't really going to take it seriously, but I logged into my email today and he had sent me a nice note within a few minutes of hanging up with me.&nbsp; It seems he may have enjoyed our conversation just as much as I did...&nbsp; And, Friday, he called me to ask a question about my great-grandfather, and left me his cell number on the message he left.&nbsp; Wow...&nbsp;  You never know.&nbsp; I have plans to attend his talk about the project on June 13 at my Grandmother's assisted living facility!&nbsp; I had promised to email him some information about our local historical society, so I better strike while the iron is hot.&nbsp; (so to speak)

<i>Commitment may be difficult for you because the experience of trauma can make you feel hopeless and helpless.&nbsp; But to make a commitment to developing spiritual resources is to keep saying ""I think I can!""&nbsp; --Dusty Miller, Ed.D.</i>

This comment surprised me with its reference to feeling hopeless and helpless.&nbsp; Maybe I really have been far more traumatized that I ever realized.&nbsp; I have always been afraid to make commitments--I find that in my life I have made many that I wish I hadn't, and not made others that I wish I had.&nbsp; Still others I made with hope, but failed to follow through.&nbsp; I suppose the biggest commitment I have never really made is the one I need to make to myself.&nbsp; Perhaps I am afraid of making that one most of all.

In my marriage, I feel like I made that commitment against my better judgement at the time.&nbsp; Because I didn't have a primary commitment to myself, I have now experienced 10 years of an unhappy marriage, and the trauma of having to extricate myself emotionally and legally.&nbsp; Maybe all this is the lesson I needed to teach me that I need to come first.

As I type that, it feels somewhat selfish, I have to admit.&nbsp; But, I think one of my survival strategies has always been to do what others want, or expect of me.&nbsp; So, anytime I think of myself, it feels like I am being selfish by not considering everyone else first.&nbsp; So, one of the things I need to promise myself is that I will consider my own wants and needs first, before anyone else's.&nbsp; That doesn't mean I have to disregard everyone else's perspective.&nbsp; But, I do need to be sure I feel secure before I can offer myself and my talents to anyone else.&nbsp; Otherwise, I wind up feeling taken for granted, and become angry and depressed.

I suppose the next step in that process is to always commit to honesty and communication.&nbsp; Respecting my own boundaries involves clear communication to others of what those boundaries are.&nbsp; If I don't communicate how unhappy I am, nothing ever changes because nobody else knows I am unhappy.&nbsp; I also need to ask others to be honest with me, so I can really know what they are thinking, instead of trying to constantly figure out what is going on.&nbsp; That way also, I can only act upon what they tell me, so I am not responsible if they are not being honest with me.&nbsp; Without open and honest communication, I trap myself in a cycle of isolation and frustration.

Also, I really need to not only listen to my inner voice, but also to heed what she is saying.&nbsp; I find that my instincts are generally very good, but I have a long history of doing things against my better judgement out of fear or unhappiness.&nbsp; When I hear that voice telling me something, I need to promise myself to listen and act accordingly!!!&nbsp; When I act against my inner voice, I know that I have dishonored myself and my own needs, so I perpetuate an inner feeling of failure and regret.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I need to be happy with who I am.&nbsp; The more I trust myself, the more I like myself.&nbsp; The more I like myself, the more I draw happiness into my life.&nbsp; If I can't be happy with who I am, I can never get away from that unhappiness, and if I can't love myself, I can't expect anyone else to be able to love me in a healthy way.&nbsp; Because, I am who I am no matter what.&nbsp; The nice thing is that I like myself more and more these days, but I can still commit to loving myself.

These few things seem simple, and maybe for others they are.&nbsp; But for me, I have survived by *not* making these promises to myself.&nbsp; It is now time for me to focus on building my strength, and so:&nbsp; 

I promise to myself that I will always:

Consider my wants and needs first.
Communicate openly with honesty.
Cherish and trust my inner voice.
Love and honor myself for who I am.

This topic reminded me of the poem/book ""Imagine a Woman in Love with Herself"" by Patricia Lynn Reilly.&nbsp; My dear friend Moon gave me this poem years ago, and I have never forgotten it.&nbsp; Although I bought the book, I never read through the whole thing.&nbsp; I just got it off my shelf, and I think a lot of it will really help me now.

Also, there was a book I saw some time ago that was about having a commitment ceremony with yourself, maybe even by the same author.&nbsp; I had a copy of it before I moved to NH, but I can't remember now what it was.&nbsp; I loved that idea, and maybe I am ready for it now.&nbsp; If anyone knows what that book is, please let me know!

"event","This book was recommended to me by my Counselor, and I decided to work through a lot of it in this journal.&nbsp; This book is subtitled ""A Spiritual Workbook for Coping with Trauma"".&nbsp; My previous post on Willingness was my answer to the first question.&nbsp; 

When my counselor first recommended it to me, I flipped through it and liked it right away.&nbsp; But, the word ""Trauma"" caught my attention.&nbsp; I told her that a large part of me didn't really feel like I had been through a ""trauma"".&nbsp; Bless her heart, she laughed at me.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I mention this because I think I am still trying to really comprehend how traumatic many of my experiences have been, especially the last two years or so.&nbsp; For so long, I have just miserably plodded through my life, dully and stoically accepting everthing that came my way.&nbsp; I always said ""You do what you have to,"" and tried to keep my head above water in all the chaos.

I have realized how truly powerless I have felt throughout most of my life.&nbsp; I feel I am still just learning to make my own decisions.&nbsp; It is frightening, and exciting all at the same time.&nbsp; Some days, I feel like I am taller--really standing up straight and breathing deeply for the first time.&nbsp; And, I still have days where I wish I could let myself be that powerless again, because I am afraid, and I want to have someone else to blame in case things go wrong.

I have often wondered how ""normal"" people live their lives.&nbsp; This sense of alienation has been with me since childhood.&nbsp; I wonder if there are people out there who are happy with their lives--content to endlessly move through a daily routine of meals, work, television and sleep.&nbsp; These simple things have always been so difficult for me.&nbsp; Could it be that I am traumatized by the simple day-to-day life?&nbsp; Or, perhaps I am traumatized by the lack of simple routines.

For a long time, I had this feeling that something inside me was missing--like a core of something, deep inside.&nbsp; The best way I can describe it is by comparing myself to the heroines from those historical ""bodice-ripper"" romances that I read in Junior High.&nbsp; These women are always beautiful, determined, strong and relentless.&nbsp; During the course of one book, the heroine can get raped, kidnapped, fall in love, get kidnapped again, be in a shipwreck, be abused, fall in love with her abuser, almost get killed, rediscover her first love, get married, become widowed, be kidnapped again...&nbsp; well, you get the picture.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp;  Through all of this, she always is determined to survive, fight and win.&nbsp; When reading these books as a teenager, I always wondered why I never felt like that.&nbsp; Maybe I was already in a state of depression at that age.&nbsp; I suppose I had already survived the trauma of childhood abuse, and also a rape when I was 13.&nbsp; I always felt like something in me was missing, and I wondered if these women were realistic characters, or if everyone was like me.

So, most of my life, I found myself just going with other people's decisions, even though they may have gone against my better judgement.&nbsp; I always figured ""Maybe things will work out okay.""&nbsp; These are the words that were running through my head during my brief marriage ceremony.&nbsp; So, now I find myself almost 10 years later, and I have finally had to take the reins guiding this disaster of a relationship and yell ""WHOA!""

I am only beginning to realize how traumatic my life has been.&nbsp; But, through it all, I have survived somehow.&nbsp; So, I think it will be really helpful to work through the questions in this book.&nbsp; After all, I do have a surviving spirit, and it is time for me to really explore my strengths and be proud of my accomplishments.&nbsp; Sure, I have spent the last 30 years or so in an ever-worsening depression, but the bottom line is that I *have* survived it.&nbsp; Thinking of it that way does make me feel stronger.&nbsp; And, it makes me want to develop my strengths, because I have a feeling that will help me avoid much of the trauma that I continuously seem to draw into my life.

One of the songs that I have learned this week for my new singing group is called ""Unfinished Tapestry"" and it is really speaking to me lately of my own life and changes.&nbsp; It was written by Vic Schneider, our Director, and it is a beautiful and haunting reminder of how amazing and complex life is.&nbsp; I remind myself that I am the weaver of my tapestry, whether I pick the colors and do the work or choose to let someone else.&nbsp; I also like to think of myself as the tapestry because it reminds me that I am made from all different qualities that weave together to produce a beautiful whole, which after all, is still unfinished.&nbsp; 

<b>Unfinished Tapestry</b> by Vic Schneider
Sung by <b>Aksara</b><i></i> on the Album ""You are With Me""&nbsp; www.soundbodyconnection.com

Unfinished tapestry, days of my life for all to see
Unfinished tapestry, deep map of love for me
Unfinished tapestry, stories in thread our history
Unfinished tapestry, windows of time for me

Threads of red, threads of blue
Woven points in every hue
Childhood memories etched in colored strands
Images of yesterday
Spun to life, relived this way
Stories told, the mem'ries of our hearts

Unfinished tapestry, days of my life for all to see
Unfinished tapestry, deep map of love for me

The stories pass through time
Our hearts are all entwined
Connected by the strands of daily living
Silence overcome
The tapestry is sung
The weaver weaves on and on her life in fabric imagery

Unfinished tapestry, days of my life for all to see
Unfinished tapestry, deep map of love for me
Unfinished tapestry, stories in thread our history
Unfinished tapestry, windows of time for me"

I have spent most of the day asleep so far.&nbsp; Great long nights' sleep and then lovely little naps.&nbsp; We had our final performance of the play last night, and then a cast party afterward.&nbsp; Lots of Chinese takeaway and Yellow Tail Shiraz to drink, and lots and lots of laughter.&nbsp; What a great crowd of people!&nbsp; And, I am very happy that they consider me a friend.&nbsp; The last 5 months with them have really been wonderful.&nbsp; At first, I was really shy and nervous, but all the work and rehearsals really paid off in more than just a great show!

This is a link to our advertisement on NH Public Radio's website
<a href=""http://nhpr.org/calendar/eventdetails.php?cid=24&catid=&eid=3555&d=22&m=4&y=2005&s=""></a>


I was kind of bummed that it was all over--&nbsp; I really have been enjoying all the activity, and suddenly we were done.&nbsp; So, the cast party was fun but bittersweet for me at the same time.&nbsp; Pam came up to me at one point and asked me if I would be interested in joining Aksara--&nbsp; an a capella women's singing group that performs all over New England, and currently has 3 CDs!&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.soundbodyconnection.com/""></a>Apparently, they really need a strong Soprano, and since all of them had seen me in the play over the last 2 weeks, I would not need to audition!&nbsp; Too cool!!!&nbsp; Pam was thrilled that I was interested, and I was thrilled to have been invited to join.&nbsp; So, tomorrow is my first rehearsal for that, and I can't wait.&nbsp; 

In the meantime, I still have the Manchester Community Chorus on Wednesdays, directed by the director of the very successful and popular NH Gay Men's Chorus&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.nhgmc.com/""></a>, and Pam and Rick have asked me to help them begin a CUUPS chapter there at the Manchester UU fellowship!&nbsp;  <a href=""http://www.uumanchester.org/""></a>

So, it all goes back to me taking a chance at attending the first rehearsal of the Manchester Community Chorus.&nbsp; In the midst of some of my worst depression, it was still my love of music that enabled me to work up the willingness to get moving again.&nbsp;  The first night I went to MCC, I met Bruce, who happened to be recruiting for his play.&nbsp; I said it sounded interesting, and whaddaya know, suddenly I was on the cast list.&nbsp; LOL!&nbsp; So, in both groups, I have met and gotten to know some really amazing people, and am truly feeling like part of a community.&nbsp; I felt like I needed to make some friends, and attending the choir would be a good way to go about meeting like-minded people, but I had no idea it would work out so well!

<b>Willingness</b>

I have been studying some Tantric philosophy, and thinking about the concept of ""willingness"" lately, and this is a great example.&nbsp; Depression is a very isolated and closed off way of being.&nbsp; There is no healthy flow of energy-- instead all the life energy is blocked up and becomes stuck and compressed in areas of the energy body.&nbsp; I have been imagining the yin/yang and how it represents the flow and ebb of energy.&nbsp; There must be movement in order to have balance.&nbsp; Depression feels like the lack of movement--&nbsp; the repression of the energy flow, and the unwillingness to move.&nbsp; It has to do with being stuck in anger, fear,&nbsp; and anxiety, which I feel are the major contributors of depression, not to mention strong forces against the healthy flow of energy.

So, I was in probably the worst depression of my life.&nbsp; My first step was to become willing to get out of it.&nbsp; With the help of some wonderful doctors and counselors, I began to feel like I might be able to ""move"" again someday.&nbsp; I read about the MCC and realized that I had become stuck in the sadness of missing my wonderful choirs at ERUUF-- Singing is such a transformative experience to me-- It felt like I had taken that sadness and compressed it all into a hard rock in my chest, so that I would not have to experience it all the time, and and I could try and deal with my new life here.&nbsp; My counselor really encouraged me to attend the rehearsal, and I really wanted to sing again, but I was afraid of the audition, and very nervous.

With a little willingness, I promised myself I would try to remain open to the new experience.&nbsp; I could always not join, but if I didn't even try, I would never know what opportunities I could miss out on.&nbsp; So, I gently tried to keep myself open enough to allow a tiny bit of energy to move me toward the audition.&nbsp; I did have to fight through my depression and fear, but I managed to get there the first night.&nbsp; I just kept thinking how much I would like to make some new friends, and how much I would like to sing.&nbsp; So, with the willingness to take the small chance to attend the audition, I could possibly begin to move forward and open up my energy to new people&nbsp; challenges.

Today, I feel a wonderful openness in my heart, and the joy of being a valued member of a few different communities!&nbsp; Even though I did really have to force myself to attend, even for weeks and months after my audition, the flow of energy got a little bigger and freer each day.&nbsp; I feel like I have been able to open myself up and gently let go of a lot of my depression.&nbsp; I had to feel it again to release it, so some days are hard when I feel like I am just fooling myself.&nbsp; But again, I am now able to move through those feelings of fear and doubt with a little willingness to believe that it really is just fear and doubt, and not truth.&nbsp; Each time, it seems like the willingness is stronger.&nbsp; And, I have discovered that willingness is a very nurturing feeling as well.

I have been able to develop a really amazing and wonderful relationship with a very special man too, thanks to a willingness to communicate, and to move through a lot of my fears...&nbsp; more on that later.&nbsp; 

So, I sit here today, very happy and very content.&nbsp; And, it was all because I was able to muster up a little willingness.&nbsp;"

"event","David called me yesterday and told me that he has received a new position, and it looks like it will be remote, so he can still move up here as planned.  Of course, I still don't know what the plan is or anything, but I feel better about it anyway.  All that Prozac really makes a difference!  Hopefully it will be a promotion and a raise, but he doesn't know yet.  I am keeping my fingers crossed.  He is planning to come up here for a week on July 2nd, a week from today, so I have to get my room clean!  LOL!

Gavin had quite a meltdown tonight on the way to dinner.  We decided suddenly to go out to Shorty's (www.shortysmex.com), which is just down the road into Bedford.  Of course Gavin was playing his $%*&@# Playstation, and didn't want to go.  I talked to him calmly for a minute, but he said he wasn't going anywhere.  I told him we were all going and I was going to leave first so I threw on my shoes and headed down the stairs.  That got his attention enough for him to start yelling at me, but he didn't budge a molecule away from the game.  Mom, Dad, and I all made a big deal about ""getting in the van first"" and loudly ran down the stairs into the garage and slammed the door.  Dad started up the van and was pulling out of the garage when Gavin came tear-assing down the stairs, swearing up a storm--yelling and spitting at us all.  I realized that I had forgotten his medicine and went back inside to get it.  Of course he followed me back into the house and stood there harangueing me while I was getting it together.  Then he decided to prevent me from leaving and blocked the door so I couldn't get back into the garage.  I locked the garage door over his shoulder so he couldn't get back in that way if he left, and I dodged quickly for the front door, ripped it open and nearly got strangled when he grabbed the back of my backpack purse as I tried to get out the door.  I managed to drag him out the door (attached to my purse the whole time), and closed the door behind him, which was already locked.  He realized that he had been tricked, and when he couldn't open the front door, he started running for the driveway.  Mom and Dad were sitting in the van with the engine running, and the garage door was still open because they had expected us to come out that way.  I was laughing to myself as Gavin ran into the garage, figuring he would run back up the stairs and go back in the house, but Dad hit the garage door remote and it started coming down while Gavin was in there.  With much shrieking and flailing, he got out under the door as it was coming down, then finally got into the van.  Then it got nasty.  

So, for the whole 15 minute drive to Shorty's, he called us names, swore, spit, hit me, hit my purse, hit his gameboy box, and even hit the car window several times.  During the course of this outburst, he called ""Grandma"" a stupid bonehead, so she took the Playstation (privilege) away from him for tonight.  Then it got uglier.  He screamed and spit, then hit me, so I took it away from him for tomorrow too.  He was telling us that he hated us all, and that we were stupid, and even making up swear words that I think seared the air they passed through.  He even said that we were the ""Three Stooniches"" and used a few other choice names that were cracking us up.  We were just about imploding trying not to laugh.  He wouldn't calm down or be quiet, so we decided to ignore him (which of course pisses him off even worse since we don't respond).  I started singing the Star Spangled Banner at the top of my lungs to drown him out, and ""Grandma"" was whistling--even ""Grandpa"" was saying ""LA LA LA LA"" at the top of his lungs.  We were all laughing, (even little mr. evil), and it just got louder and louder.  Gavin didn't know whether to hit me or crack up.  LOL!

We finally pulled into the parking lot and Gavin was still pretty fired up, but at least he wasn't hitting me anymore.  He ran up the ramp into the restaurant and hid in the hallway to the bathroom while we got on the waiting list, but strangely enough, when we were seated a minute later, Gavin was right with us, sliding into the booth.  He was still pretty pissed, but within about 2 minutes was working on the kids' menu with his crayons.  As soon as the pineapple juice came a minute later, he took his medicine, and had a nice time until we left.  Sheesh.

I had the Jerry Garcia Quesadilla, which was wonderful!  It is an herbed tortillia with fajita chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, hunks of fresh avocado, spinach, tons of melted cheddar-jack blended cheese and a mayonnaise-like dressing.  Wow!  We were all so stuffed, we didn't do dessert.  Probably a good thing.  Although, their peanut-butter passion dessert is a complete FOODGASM!!!  <sigh>"

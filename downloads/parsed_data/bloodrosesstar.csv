and I was disgusted... because she's so naive and dumb, and he's just a poser annoying fuck, that you know what the deal is there... he wants to fuck a hot blonde, and she'll believe him when he says ""i love you""... blah blah blah-

so anywho, Tuesday night who was in the audience... Constantine, and granted there were other previous idols there, but he was sitting next to the one and only Ryan Cabrera... talk about ""sitting fags"" (instead of ""sitting ducks"") for trash talking... ok, I digress...

So if Constantine was with Ryan and dating Kellie, I have a funny feeling-
   and here's the conspiracy-

that MR. SIMPSON is trying to yet again market a ""dumb-blonde"". 

It's all politics... Ryan's dating or was dating Ashley, so he'll use his lil' fame to ploy in Constantine, who in turn will tell Pickler whatever she needs to hear to get what he wants-  but it's really Mr. Simpson playing ""Puppet Master""-

I wonder how long it took for him to devise such a scheme???? 

Pickler, I predict, will be the next ""dumb-blonde"" sex symbol in the pop culture world....

if she can keep her mouth shut for 5 goddamn minutes!!!

and although you probably never think of it, it's been over a year that I've been trying to woo him... 

To this day, anytime he walks into my work I still get the crazy butterfly school-girl crush feeling ... even though we practically live together. 

Even though I get paranoid or insecure, it's comforting knowing that feeling is still there- 

it beats out all of the anxiety by miles. 

Last year I never thought it would have happened... now I get to see him for the better half of the day. 

I once thought of a quote that expressed my feelings-
   ""I can't wait for the day that I no longer have to look forward to seeing 
     you, because you'll be there by my side.""

I never actually thought it would happen! 

But the truth is, even when I'm on my way to see him I couldn't get there soon enough- I always look forward to seeing him, even if all I have to do is turn my head. 

It's a nice day today."

It's quite odd to picture a life... then see it become reality. 

When things are so good that they feel surreal, insecurity is sure to rear it's ugly head. The part of it that is difficult to deal with is that there's a lack of things to be insecure about. Which makes the situation that much more surreal. 

I wonder sometimes where my programming came from- 

why when things have gone arye I wasn't ""rebooted"" so to speak, 
memory is one of my biggest problems... the lack of memory from things that have happened to me as a child, and memory of bad things that have happened in the recent past. If I could remember one, I could assess the other... but I don't have it like that. 


I'm sure everyone would like to be self-confident and assured, 
I certainly have been given many reasons to be within these last few months, 
but now paranoia is setting in, 
and I often wonder if everything is just an act,
because of who I am. 

People go through personality changes, 
when I go through mine I usually end up with a new hair style, clothes, or tattoo to match that personality....
but this time around I can't seem to find the match. 

It reminds me how things fell into place pretty much how I wanted them to, 
and perhaps I no longer need to make image changes,
because I'm right where I need to be. 

That burning desire to be some place different is growing.
My curiousity of what's out there is growing.


Why is it that when things seem so good, we get the desire for change?!"

the people who use these web-sites correctly are those of whom are searching for long lost individuals or the intelligent folks who are stirring up thought-provoking conversation....

i'm sorry, but if you talk shit about someone consistently and then they show up on your friends page on these web-sites, that makes you a fucking loser.... a cowardice as well!

if you need 300 people to be on your friends page just to make yourself feel good, you might as well slit your wrists and call it a fuckin' day, because it means that you're just a sorry excuse for an individual that this world no longer needs- 

if you can't find yourself and go out of your way to feel special by the authority of others...who have no importance on your life, besides the fact that you desperately need their approval for your life circumstance--- well, to put it frankly, you're worthless.

I'm so pale and ghastly I could be the Corpse Bride... I've never seen that movie. Was it good?

You know what movie I did see? Party Monster... talk about freaks without a leash... that's what happens when parents wear blindfolds when it comes to their kids' behavior.  Interesting movie no less... and appearantly the casting was near perfect.... everyone looked the part, and played it well. Everyone in the movie is pretty much recognizable in the very least... if you don't already know their names- which you probably would if you grew up in the last 15 years... which the majority of us did. Oh yeah, and by ""us"" I mean the people I know. Not like the majority of the country or anything... I wouldn't speak for the country... or the idiots in it.... besides I don't know how to speak ignorantly.... haha. Yeah that's right, I'm trying to say this country is ignorant---- ""I'm just playing America, you know I love you.""  - eminem

Hmm, perhaps I better research grammar a bit more, mine is a lil' off. 

So, despite spending the past two days in my bed I'm still not feeling too peachy keen. Fuzzy like a peach, yes; keen like one, no. It's all good though, cause I did want to detoxify my body and in a sense that is occurring. I'm not really eating... and if I do it's either broth or jell-o or fruit. Been chugging V-8. For some reason I can't get enough of that shit. It's so delicious to my taste buds, they ache for more and more and more. I figured if by chance I had a parasite or some sort of bacteria the acid in the V-8 could probably kill it or decrease its life span... but I'm not a doctor. That may not be the cure to my problem. But it's tasty!

If it turns out to be something else that's wrong with me... like the flu, intestinal virus, or stomach bug that's going around I should be alright within 10 days of it starting.... which was tuesday at 3 a.m.- so by next friday if I'm not all better it means death for me. haha. ok not death, but certainly not health... or not good health. or perhaps life.... pregnant with quintuplets (right ashley?)!!! haha. 

Well, to sum it all up, I'm not feeling like myself, that's for damn skippy- 

Supposedly I'm going to be getting my portfolio ( a year and a half late) - but at this point, I don't even want that shit... there are probably like 3 pics that are worth getting... and the rest are crap. Not because of the photographer but because of me.... 
                
                   DON'T TAKE PICTURES WHEN YOU'RE NOT HAPPY! 

in most of the pictures I look like a battered child... or wife, whatever. Here's a lil' secret why: because I was.... mentally- it's amazing what I let get under my skin and ruin my day. Well, it's amazing what I USED to let ruin my day. Nowadays, I get mad at stupid shit and within a few moments of logic or realism I'm over it. 

I think it's because I've now met people who have played the great game of Life, which gave me the priviledge to see that if the worst of my problems was some retard that pissed me off, I had it very very good. It's a simple fix, and no real harm is done. It's a comfort to see the hard shit that people have made it through. As bad as that sounds, it is. It's inspiration to keep moving forward with life despite what's been played. I get to learn from those experiences that they confide in me, on top of being there for the person, with that comes respect and love. 

Respect and love, not that it hasn't always been there... but it's something I just recently began recognizing as a part of my life. On a level that adults can appreciate... not the shit that you talk about when you're 14. 

Talk about blabbering...

We went to Santa Cruz for the day-

Then on Thursday night we went shopping all day and to a couple of bars at night.... we went to this new club called ""Air"", which had a WICKED sweet set-up. We walked in (3 lil' white girls) to about 20 blacks and hispanics just chillin'.... I felt kind of out of place at first, but the bartender was this wicked sweet black chick who welcomed us whole-heartedly... and mad some killer mix drinks! haha. 

Of course my sister Kate and I were the ones to start the dance party off... when we started dancing all the other people did too... and because it wasn't so crowded it was like we all showed up together. It was probably my favorite time of the trip. The men who wanted to dance with us were so sweet and they'd take us by the hand and give us a lil' spin and dance in front of us about a foot away... but doing what we were dancing so it was actual couple dancing! It was very refreshing...

Then the last day we did a ""spa"" day... we went to this place and you get a half-hour soak in a hot tub then an hour long message afterwards... the hot tub was pretty much outdoors which was awesome! Especially since we were nakey...haha.

Being back home was good too--- went to a surprise party the night I came back, and spent the rest of the night with my boo then went to Leanne's baby shower on sunday and again went and chilled with my man at night.... which brings me here... to Monday morning!

the first couple of days were fun thus far... 

i got a lil' pissy because we went out to dinner, where the serving staff were transgendered individuals- which is all good and well until you see them perform (not good) and see the bill.... between 6 of us we spend near $500. i didn't think it was worth it... considering that i threw down $80 when i really was only going to get $30 worth of food and drinks.... but because of how the restaurant does certain things and because it was somebody's birthday i end up spending much more than anticipated.... 

but you can't put a price on a good time. that's what counts- that we all had an awesome time! 

then we went out to another bar, which totally blew balls. i didn't want to drink so i asked for a coke and end up with a Jack-n-coke... not good! not a big whisky fan. 

OH YEAH! before the dinner my sisters and i stopped at a mexican place for some 'ritas and because we had time to kill we ordered the ""super"" size..... DAMN!!! that cup came out and i swear there was enough margarita to fill my fucking head and serve it that way. mmmm, coconut and pineapple margarita! haha. 

surprisingly, despite my 64 oz. rita, the three drinks at dinner, and the last drink at the bar I never even got tipsy... nevermind drunk! it's a bit odd... i don't drink, so when i do it usually doesn't take too much... but maybe on the west coast my body can handle it a bit better, because i did not get intoxicated in the slightest... but i'm hoping to accomplish that goal tonight when we go dancing!! haha. 

we were gonna check out a club that is doing a prince vs. michael jackson music party, but we're going to stay close-by instead--- i wish they'd do a party like that around us though... that would be sweet ass sweet, motha-fucker! 

other than that i'm missing my friends, and my boogs ... i can't wait to be in his arms again listening to his sweet nothings. 

ASHLEY- get your shit together girl, cause when i come back we're gonna party it up like it's 19- forty - fucking - nine! haha... i just used that number because it sounded good with the ""fucking"" in the middle...

Finding places to rent is a big pain in the arse! I find ""surfing the net"" to be frustrating and annoying because one web-site will be listed 100 different times under all the names they possibly could be under.... you know it cost money for every name you register under... so when you're registered 100 times, you're paying for all 100 of those names.... that's crazy! On top of it, all the sites have the same places for rent.... I don't know how many times I've seen listings for Bigelow Commons, or Mill Pond Village.

You know what I hate? When you care greatly about a person, but you have little effect on ways to  help them. I'm not trying to be mother theresa or anything, but I would like to offer a helping hand every now and again. Usually it's not worth my efforts... but for the times that it is, and things don't go well, I get upset. Almost as if it were happening to me. 

I guess I just hate seeing people struggle with inner turmoil... because that's shit that no one can fix, except for the person with the inner conflicts.  I can try and channel the pain, or use energy to release it, but that's the sort of thing you  have to prepare for. If you're going to release energy from one person, either that energy will end up in you, or it will end up within the atmosphere with the ability to go in any direction- including back into the person it was released from. I try not to mess with that stuff, because you don't know what you'll undo.

You know, they say that dreams are the gateways to our minds, and that's all well and good, but they still haven't been able to pinpoint dreams to an exact science. 

Dream interpreters, the books and what have you have sorted out possible meanings for items or feelings or places in your dreams, but those meanings can't possibly apply to all- the person themselves have to be intune to their subconscious in order to give themselves a partly accurate interpretation. 

My dreams haven't been making much sense these last couple of weeks. They've been quite pictoral, and in color. I've tried to interpret a couple... the ones that caused a bit confusion at least. The interpretations are conflicting though- 

one dream tells me that I will be the object of jealousy, someone will be envious of me -  (not bloody likely)

the second dream says that basically I'm trying to impress people by being something I'm not, as well as having paranoia about a certain situation. 

How can one be envious of me, if I'm not being myself??? 

Oh well, I suppose that's what happens to crazy women! haha. 

As of August I've been trying to go with the flow of things... never really planning anything, or expecting anything from others. It's been working quite nicely- 

i'm with the man I've crushed on for very long-
i think i might have made closer connections to my friends... or at least i feel i have-
i've been able to overcome some insecurities i had, and found a way to be  happy with that of which i was insecure about-
i've opened my eyes to different lifestyles, because it's the person living the lifestyle that counts, not the lifestyle itself-

basically i've just been trying to follow the signs i've been given by nature, greater phenomenon, everything. 

things have been great by doing so. sometimes there's a redundancy, but that's life when you're content. it's important to remember at any given point in time we have the power to do what we want- if that means taking a spontaneous trip, or doing something out of the ordinary, or even testing ourselves with a new activity we've never tried, so be it. 

my new activity that tests me is trying a new sexual position every night! hahahaha - just joking... i'm like the virgin mary now... haha.

think of yourself at the start of a curve, and continuous one because it's really a circle... when you walk along that line, you'd go up and down, up and down, up and down, until the very end.... which there isn't any, because it's a circle! so if we could somehow plot our starting point, and follow our life's curve/circle we'd be able to estimate how many lifetimes old we are; kind of like rings in a tree trunk! from there we'd be able to tell where we've been... and possible guesstimate where we are going....

They showed video of them beating a homeless man with bats ... now, they're probably still a lil' retarded from young age and no experience in life, but any person in their right mind would steer away from a situation like that... who needs to gang up on a homeless man three times their age???  

The best part about the story is the homeless man was fighting back!!! He didn't even need the use of a weapon. He not only managed to fight back, but he also survived the beating!! 

The story reminded me of a quote recently posted on this lj: 

 ""Sorry, sometimes you need to blow off a little steam, and when you need to do that sometime you need to take it out on the ""lower class"" part of America. People in high places just feel the need to sometime piss all over the poor. ""  - Anonymous Asshole 

Now, I don't know what drove those boys to do that act of violence... but it's the ignorant people, such as these boys , ""anonymous asshole"" and such that are the cause of uproar and violence. I mean, I'll keep it real- there's nothing more uncomfortable to me than seeing a homeless person begging for money or food... I hate that whole scenerio, no matter who it involves. However, I'm not going to go beat their ass for being poor, that's their business. 

There's two points that I'm trying to make here: 

 1. That homeless man is now going to be swimming in money because not only does he get to press charges, they have video of what happened, so it's an open and shut case- those boys will be going to jail, if not get sentenced the death penalty. I say ""amen"" to that.

 2. It's about time that all ignorant people start getting treated the way they treat others... I don't care if people can flash wads of hundreds in my face, it doesn't mean I respect them or that I'll bow down and cater to any of thier needs.  C'mon, crack dealers have wads of hundreds... should we consider them the upper class, or a person in a ""high place"" ? 

It's all very sad the way the human race has devolved ... we've become a race of humiliating , lazy, disrespectful fools. 

My man brought up a good point the other night-
He talked about the slaves of Egypt during the times of the pyramids, and said, ""yeah they were slaves, but all of them got to eat. They all had a place to sleep in at night..."" .  Here in America there's about 5% of poor people, there's 0.5% of rich people, which means 94.5% of the U.S. is considered ""the working poor""- because we work work work, and yet remain in debt. This is where living in a capitalistic society has brought us. I think I'd rather being a slave in Egypt ... cause EVERY work site had a brewery next to it; so not only were they working but they were drunk, and it was ok. On top of that, their construction was like a million times better than ours, despite the fact that they were drunk!  
Where the hell is the red light to stop us in our tracks, so that we can work on becoming what should have been??? 

Even if you were the wealthiest person in America... or better yet, if you owned America, you know how much money you'll have??? 
The answer: um... you'll be $ 30 BILLION in debt! 

I think I'll stay happy with my low-key lifestyle. I don't have to worry about shit! I get to do what I want when I want, enjoying life to the bests of my abilities.

"event","So the ladies and I shimmied out for the evening, looking good, feeling good and ready to party-

But as the night continued it became more and more lame.

Why do you ask?
Because of lame ass men who think they're the shit...

Part of the evening goes like this:

the four of us are sitting in a booth at a late-night restaurant and a couple of us may have been yelling at each other, for stupid reasons mind you... and the four men behind us, chime in to tell us to ""shut up"".... i'm not exactly sure what they said, because they didn't have the balls to say it loud enough, which is ironic, because if you're mad enough to complain then you would think they'd be brave enough to voice their opinion...but no, they were pussies... but anywho after one of us offended one of them, another one chimed in - even after i told my girl to ignore them; so the second guy continues to look at me and tell me ""we're trying to have a nice meal here, just leave you piece of shit"" ...  uh ...... 

we were at fucking Denny's- who the fuck is trying to have a nice meal there except for trashy pieces of shit??? so i think those A-holes got it all wrong... on top of it we had a pregnant one with us, which she claims the pregnancy is making her racist so of course she tells them ""if you don't like it, go back to your own fucking country..."" yada yada yada... i don't agree with that statement, because none of us are from America... Americans haven't even been around long enough to claim any kind of ownership to this land... we're all immigrants, and that's why we're considered the ""land of the free"". we should actually be called ""the land of the rebels"", because basically we all stem from people who didn't want to hack it in their native country so they fled and started a new life here.... but she is pregnant, and those guys were dicks, so i really didn't mind that she said it....and in fact i laughed out loud about it- 

something interesting though:
 one of the guys looked uncomfortable or what have you.... you can tell that he didn't think his friends should be talking to us like that ... so my conclusion would be that 1 in 4 men have manners and respect for women, and just to make it exciting- the other three probably have STD's and/or VD. 

so ladies, if you're single you have a 1 in 4 shot to find a respectful man and a 3 in 4 shot of getting a disease... let's all run out and find a husband today, chances are it won't be pretty! haha. 

anywho, good times.

TO MY ""LOVING FANS"" a.k.a. ""Anonymous asshole""- 

i'm glad to see you learned that there's safety in numbers...
here's the thing though, if it takes a plural, meaning more than one, amount of you to have the balls to post something on here then really your value is diminished down to about 1/3 or maybe 1/2 ... because any normal person can post whatever they want to say...and they can do it ALONE - 
and since you guys are obviously so chummy, why don't you do the world a favor, pull a Thelma & Louis and hold hands while you drive off a cliff-
you don't even have to hold hands ... you can diddle each other if it makes you feel better! *sparkling smile*  ...

It was so sweet it made me want to cry ... cause I'm a dork ... but an oh so very lucky one! haha. 


I'm not going to share this story with all y'all good folks, because it's so nice, it's best to keep it to myself, so I can cherish the feeling for as long as I'm capable of... but you know it has to do with my yummy delicious man! haha. 

Who's going to see date movie?!?! 

I am. I am. 

We'll see if it lives up to my expectations of hilariousness...haha...

So I checked out a different bar last night... 
it smelled like balls... gross ones... with piss, shit, sweat, and jesus juice all over them... 

the people in there looked like balls... gross ones ... with piss, shit, sweat, and jesus juice all over them... oh yeah, and they also acted like mongrels... they would literally just stare at you for minutes at a time...

um, is it just me, or are guys getting more and more lazy (as well as lame) with their pick-ups ??  

this is probably why women like older men or old-fashioned ones because they still show women some fucking respect. not only that, but they also actually TRY to charm the woman they're picking up... with old-school romance or some shit... guys these days are just fucking pathetic. 

if I considered myself single...and ready to mingle.. i'd probably be forced to become a lesbo because honestly men these days have absolutely nothing to offer- 
...and it took being with a real man to see that... a woman will never know her value until she is with a man that knows her value... a real man. 

what's funny is that the stereotypical college male will think he's ""THE MAN"" for sleeping with multiple women... but he's just doing the same shit that men have done for THOUSANDS of years--- 

i'd like to see some men start coming up with some new ideas for which they can call themselves ""the man"" for... for instance, maybe coming up with a better line than ""hey"" ... hahahaha .. ok , so sometimes it's not THAT bad, but still. i guess this is all coming out because i've been chillin' with some older men lately - friends' boyfriends and friends of the family ...and what have you, and they say and do some of the most thoughtful and cutest shit, that it's hard not to fall for them.  

we need more old-school lovin' out there!!! 

well, I don't... I'm gettin it! wahoo!!! haha... 

perhaps that's what happens when you wait for the right guy, the right time, and the right reasons....

Anywho, you know how there are people who are so conceited, that it makes you question if they're a lil' retarded?

You kind of give them the benefit of the doubt, but after a while you get tired of their attitude and kick them to the curb??

Isn't it amazing that no matter what you said, or say, to that individual they still keep the frame of mind that their god's gift...

What is up with that?! 

If I tell you ""you're an asshole, stay out of my life"" , I MEAN ""you're an asshole, stay out of my life"" ...  not anything more, not anything less. 

The problem is that people are not honest these days--- for whatever reason, they have issues with the truth. So when you have people who actually tell the truth, or tell it like it is, these RETARDS with the ego problem fuck everything up, because they hear something completely different... something that probably just makes them feel good about themselves. 

Perhaps this is such a qualm for me because of the many assholes who have come and gone in my life...
Granted there are differing circumstances to the departures, but it really bothers me that I end things on sour notes purposefully, because I want those fuckers to remember the harsh exchange of words...so that they will never have a nice thought about me... so that they wouldn't contact me or what have you anymore.

Yet I still come across people with the self-absorbed immature characteristic that has them thinking they are #1 in the world. 

What urks me even more, is that I've met a very SMALL handful of people that deserve to have a sort of conceit to them... and they don't.... but then out of all of the dumbasses out there in the world, 95 % would talk highly about themselves ....

Where and how do these people get the idea that it's ok to behave in such a manner?

"event","Last night I was reminescing within my own thoughts and something facsinating occurred to me-

When I was in 2nd grade I was going to a Catholic school in Springfield, and it was the year that we made our first confessions (Yeah that's right, I used to practice a religion!) - 

I was very excited to make my first confession... probably because I could admit to my wrong doings without getting in trouble. The sins that I confessed to were: fighting with my sisters, ""stealing"" a few bucks from my mom to buy candy, cursing and, oh no, smoking cigarettes. The priest told me to say 3 hail-mary's and and another prayer, that I can't remember in this point in time.... 

Being a kid when I stepped out of the confessional room I started playing with my friends ... and ten or 15 minutes later my mom had come out from a confession and she asked ""Did you do your prayers?"" .... I thought I was going to hell for certain because I forgot to do them. Her and I did our prayers together.

Anywho, the point of all this is that I find it a bit ironic that my greatest vices to date are cursing and smoking. I HATE smoking... or everything that comes with it, the smell, the taste, the feeling when you've smoked too much... it's just not enjoyable, but because I'm pyschologically weak and have no control, quitting is quite difficult for me. Cursing... I love it! I will use the words fuck, shit, cock-sucker, faggot (not really a curse word, but obscenity nonetheless)pussy, cunt, and dumbass for the rest of my life. It doesn't harm me, it doesn't harm the person or persons they're being said to, they're just words.

My thought is, that perhaps if the priest had a stronger reaction to my ""sins"" or implemented some sort of consequence within my head at that point, maybe I wouldn't be playing with fire at this point in time. He was a person who was of influence, and with that influence I was seeking out an impact... but there was none. 

If a 7 year-old comes up to you and tells you that they curse and smoke slap them across the head, or their ass or just beat them ---- trust me, it might save their life !!! Ok, so I'm just joking about the beating part. 

The bottom line is; we are all an influence on somebody... even complete strangers and the effects that may arise from our actions will be an impression for the rest of their lives...

Make sure you're making a good impression and leaving behind something for them to think about, so that they may discover who they wish to become and have the ability to work on becoming it throughout the years."

My body knows things are coming before it comes... for instance ear piercings- they get sore and swollen before something significant in my life ends.... I just had to let my second cartilidge piercing close Saturday night... an end is near. 

I've talked about searching for signs from my angels and receiving a few here and there ... last night, a sign came up... but it wasn't for me, it was for my man. Now I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place. I don't know what the outcome will be... I kind of figure one scenerio, because I said good-bye without having a reason to... and my reason came the next day. My need to keep my emotions in is either a blessing or a curse ... either way, it makes me feel protected.

"event","Let me explain why I'm the luckiest girl in the world!

I often talk about a sexy, gorgeous man I'm involved with...and this will be about things he's told me. 

First off, he'll admit that perfect packaged women are nice to have around...but he'll also be the first to say ""That's not the kind of sexy you want to be..."" 

""The expression 'blondes have more fun' is really a perverted statement...it's really saying, 'they get more come on their face', you don't want that""  - that's the reason you don't want to fit into the stereotypical class of ""sexy"". 

He's also said that what makes a woman sexy is her personality and intelligence... someone you can actually talk to... where as with the stereotypical sexy girls...the majority of them are incapable of having an intellectual conversation ""you don't even have to pay attention, and you'll still know what she's saying... all you have to do is smile and say 'yeah' and  you're on target"".

Another thing he's said to me:
""Your body is perfectly proportioned throughout... you CAN become very skinny and have a very tiny body, and be EXTREMELY hot... but that's not the type of sexy you want to be"".  

He's randomnly grabbed parts of my body, that I've always hated due to the flabbiness of them, and has said ""ooh, this is nice"" and I'd almost die of shock. For example...my thighs! You know that expression ""more cushion for the pushing"", well that pretty much holds true... he likes my body because it has a warmth to it, he let me know that it's there for protection...like on my bones...and his. 

He's let me know that with my looks, my brain, my body and personality that I could have any guy I wanted ... if I were just more confident, I'd be able to recognize that. --Maybe that's pushing it, but I let him know that I got the guy I wanted, so I may be able to believe that one... then we laughed together. 

I could go on and on with the compliments and truths he's given me. What I've concluded from the whole thing is that men all have different opinions on beauty, what's sexy, and all that good junk- my thoughts are that we have this idea of what's sexy that all men can agree on... what they don't tell you is that it's not their personal liking. If men started telling the truth on whom they thought were truly beautiful, they'd have to actually open up and express some emotion and thought.... which is something that they'd be judged on. God forbid they actually open up and admit to who they are! haha. 

Anyway, I'm the luckiest girl in the world because my man opens up to me... or better yet, he let's me know how and why men think the way they think. 
I'm the luckiest girl in the world because I'm with the man I've longed for-
I'm the luckiest girl in the world because I no longer feel the need to be self-conscious because of the man that I'm with-
I'm the luckiest girl in the world because for once I can be myself and the man I find to be beautiful, intelligent, and funny thinks the same way about me!

My enemies would have to be a lil' intelligent, because I don't socialize with dumbasses.... assholes, drug abusers, sluts and skanks, over-talkers, loud and obnoxious fucks... (haha)... but not dumbasses-

I've come to find that the majority of people are just, for a lack of a better term, pussies.

Well I'm finding that those very special individuals are those of whom end up being viewed as ""failures"" or ""unsuccessful"" in life- which entails, not having a steady job, not having a family, and not having material possessions that can get you into a private white-men's country club....

Anywho, my theory is as follows:

  If we didn't have the lazy-ass retards we consider teachers then maybe these special individuals would be stimulated enough to keep on track and become ""successful""--- the reason why these people end up being the black sheep of society is because they were never given the proper stimulation, mentally, to drive themselves to find a career. They probably got bored with people, schooling, and life at an early age, then started drinking and/or smoking, having some sort of addiction...either to substance or gambling or sex.

I say we start getting better educators in our systems... people who want to teach all aspects of life, people who want to see each child succeed to become the best they have to offer, people who are intellectual enough to know how to make dreams come true for their students.... We need teachers that will know where each individual should settle in life. Hell, we just need teachers that know simple education, because even that would make an improvement. 

There was some survey or some bullshit, that showed 47% of college graduates are incapable of doing simple math, such as calculating a 20% tip for waitstaff, nor could they distinguish nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs- simple grammar..... FUCKING 47% !!! And it's all shit you learn in ELEMENTARY school!

Now, because of the results they're considering teaching those things in college now.....and I say FUCK THAT! I will NOT pay $24, 000 per year to learn shit that I've repeatedly been taught over and over again, because there are dumbfucks who want to party as opposed to apply themselves to their education. These are college graduates! These fucking idiots are out in the world starting a professional career and polluting our world and country with their idiocracies! Not to mention, a good percentage of them are becoming TEACHERS! 

Don't you think that if we saved some of our brightest individuals for a teaching position our upcoming generations will be a bit brighter than the last...and then that trend will continue, making for brighter adults, that are better at their jobs...which will then cause a boom in the economy because everyone is successful in their endeavors...BECAUSE they had the appropriate education!

Just saying-

But what would I know... I'm an uneducated, unsuccessful person that can do anything....but I'm so bored with life- I do nothing."

Anywho, I gained the weight right back, and then some...

There are a few theories circulating as to why women gain weight...or people in general for that matter-

1. women gain weight when they're involved in a consistent sex life

2. people, especially women, gain weight when they're happy

3. people, especially women, gain weight during the winter as insulation from the cold

I'm sure there are others, but considering I've been eating less and more healthy, weight gain is kind of an odd occurrence. 

So, I concluded that I'm a happy woman with an awesome sex life, that happens to be blossoming during the winter...

Ice Cream

To see or eat ice cream in your dream, denotes pleasure and satisfaction with your life. It is also an indicative of good luck and success in love.

Dust 

To see dust in your dream, suggest that aspects of yourself have been ignored or neglected.  


What's my conclusion? Well, since ice-cream denotes luck in love, and the ice-cream was surrounded by dust, denoting my neglect in myself...i would say that i have neglected myself in receiving love...and now it's time that I can make up for it, because I have luck on my side...

Which is quite fitting actually, because I finally let myself go, allowing for many good things to happen with my man! haha. So even though I allowed for neglect towards me in the past...I'm ready and willing to make up for it now...and my mind is telling me that now is the time to let it happen....

At this rate, maybe I'll be married with babies by this time next year! haha. just joking! I'll just have babies without the marriage! haha...joking again!

"event","So, I'm an Earth sign....

The thing that intimidates me the most is the ocean....all oceans...because of their size, the life they carry, and their power. Maybe it's stupid...but fear is fear, and I fear the ocean.

Well, anywho, Nostradamus predicted that the U.S. will eventually consist of 3 seperated pieces of land...that the coasts were going to flood on both sides, and the glaciers from the north are going to melt clashing with huge hurricanes from the south and then the mid-west would also be flooded and under water....so if I'm ""earth"" it's no wonder that I fear water...because appearantly it will be my doom. 

Just a lil' interesting tid-bit to go along with astrology and what makes me me.

Also, I did a reading with a deck of angel cards...one of the cards I got was called ""signs"" and it means that my angels are sending me all the signs and answers I need, but I'm pre-occupied that I'm not noticing them....however for the last couple of weeks I've been asking my angels for answers...so that card let me know that the answers are present-

Last night, I was watching Leno, and a comic was performing, she's a favorite from way back in the day, when I was still like 13 or 14, and she had recently gotten married to a guy named Jeffrey- which is the name of the guy I thought was my ""kindred"" when I was 14 through to basically the present...and Barry Manelow (spelling?) was on singing ""old-chained melody""...which is the song that I always relate back to my ""kindred""...

So, those are two things that take me way back...and I wondered if they were signs from my angels...

The depressing thing is, I was in bed with my beautiful being of a lover and I thought that if Geoff was my second-half, and I had to make a decision between him and Dan, I wouldn't be able to do it...(not that I'd ever really have to)....but even so- 
I wanted to cry at the thought. 

What I know, is that Dan is a very special person... he has a very different perspective on life, and situations, and he's very very loving...always knows how to make a person laugh and feel better about themselves. Not many people have that natural ability. 

Maybe he was not put on this earth for me...but I'm certainly glad that our paths crossed, because he has made a world of difference in my life. I feel very priviledged to have received his love and affection as well as hear his thoughts. He's simply amazing. 

Perhaps this is all a bunch of gobbly-gook but isn't it ironic?"

"event","So on Saturday a bunch of ladies went to the comedy club... it was a really good time. I was right next to the stage, so it was easy to make fun of me...haha. 

By the end of the night I was a lesbian, with herpes, that liked lap dances from comedians....haha. Why do people feel compelled to rub their junk on me??? I don't know, but the MC and both comics were fucking hysterical! It was great.

Then following the show I got a special phone call from ""Daniel-son"" and I ended up spending the night with him in his hotel. It's really nice to fall asleep in someone's arms...get a great night's sleep, and wake up holding them, and being held by them. I love the way that people fit together like puzzle pieces, no matter what their size or shape is. It's even more pleasuring when it's with somebody you have a huge crush on...even after 6 or 7  months of being with them! He still makes me giddy, and that's nice!

Then yesterday I got my hair colored...it was supposed to be dark brown, but I also used a darker red with the color, so it kind of looks like a deep reddish maroonish color....I'll be coloring it again within a few days with just brown...haha. 

There's kind of family conflict arising...difference of opinions really, but it could lead to something very hurtful...or it could end up having a great outcome...it's up in the air. I guess those of whom know the truth will end up being the most prosperous of the situation. I'll have to wait to see what the outcome will be. 

Other than that I'm a lazy piece of shit nowadays...hopefully someone will set ambition on fire, under my ass so that I can get back on track with things. 

That's all folks! 
Have a peachy day."

I don't know how he got to be so wonderful...but I likey...I likey alot!

Can I just say 'holla' to Cruzan Mango Rum...and Mango Margarita Mix!!! It is so freakin' tasty...

Girls' night out tomorrow! Super-psyched for that schizzo. 

I'm making a kick-ass samurai ""welcome mat"" for my brotha from another motha...same daddy though. It's going to be so freakin' awesome! It's kind of odd how similar each set of siblings actually are...maybe it's the roles that first, middle, last children take on...or maybe it's genetics...anywho, he's the youngest of three and so am I and we're very much alike...which is pretty cool.

Been talking about moving out with some folks...that's something to look forward to in the future...then maybe I can have boys sleep over, in my bed! haha....oh wait, I already did that move...and it was fabulous! 

Gonna chill with jenn-unit tonight, probably get into some shit... hahaha...just joking!

"event","You know how like, 2 maybe 3 years ago Krista said that if you go through a yellow light, and kiss your hand and touch the roof of your car you're ""promised"" an hour of good sex??? 

Well I did that since the day she told me...and I waited, waited, and WAITED some more...and even though I was having sex...it was not GOOD sex...

I was all confused, like what the fuck? 

I now realize, that believing in that superstition, allowed me to pick out a partner that would be an excellent lover... 

So even though I had to rack up ""the credit"" for good sex over the last couple of years...I'm telling ya, it's really paid off. I chose an excellent lover...and he's giving me weeks of great sex...not hours...WEEKS! 

hahahahaha. 

Thank you Krista! 

Anywho, I've been thinking...and I didn't hurt myself, but what I've been thinking is how sometimes I get so envious of the people I know that went off to college and started a new life somewhere-

Sometimes I wish I took that oppurtunity too...but in the same breath I'm thankful for avoiding that same situation....young men are gross pigs, and young women...the great majority of them...are insecure and easily manipulated, so they end up behaving like whores... I probably would have behaved in that same manner- 

I believe that all things happen for a reason...even though it was obligation that has kept me where I am today...I believe it was meant to be. I've gotten to learn so much about myself because I had the time to be with myself and think about who, what, where I want to be. I've also met some very key people in the last year...whom I would not have met if I went off to college and done the traditional works of ""life"". I've become very close and appreciative of friends and family. 

Perhaps college seems like it's all fun and games, and getting a degree is important...but college kids will never get to experience what I have...so I consider myself lucky in that regard. 

It's good to look at all sides of the spectrum...there are colors in between red, yellow, and blue...a whole world of colors! 

I skipped over red, yellow, and blue- living in the greens, purples, and oranges--- how many people were willing and ready to do that?"

Didn't buy Jaime Foxx...not what I expected it to be...so I passed on that...but I did buy a few good books!

I recently watched 40-year old Virgin...very very funny....War of the Worlds..not super interesting...and Wedding Crashers...semi-funny.

there's a joke of the day that I have to tell...but really I'm trying to avoid all the petty shit that I once filled my life with...so I'll keep that as a verbal conversation, face-to-face shit. 

on new year's eve, came across a few problems...some dumb bitch stole my champagne...and some dumb asshole called me a bitch because he was trying to hit on me with lame ass remarks like ""we haven't met before, what's your name?"" like 3 minutes after he just introduced himself to me....why is it that when people are honest (especially women) they are turned into the bad guys....I'm sorry but I'm not attracted to 300 lb. men that slur over their words without any game or charm...and then to call me a bitch on top of it is just retarded. I wasn't even bitchy...although I wish I was now, because I had the right to be! 

anywho, even though those two retards scuffed up a perfect evening, i still had a good time! 

making plans to visit my other siblings...which is exciting! 

my man is still calling and spending time, so that's all good- i think we have a hot date tonight, as a matter of fact! haha.

2. -Watching baby Jacob grow into a walking, dancing, noise-making adorable toddler! While his parents (Cathy & Bobby) become more responsible and COOLER everyday!! I love you guys!!!


3. - Making peace with old friends...recognizing their importance and significance in my life...I wouldn't be me without them. Afterall, high school wasn't too long ago...

4. - My girls' advice in trying to win the heart of a beautiful man- thanks for the encouragement, I wouldn't have gotten him without all of your good words of wisdom!

5. - Ashley : "" Just say 'MMM, Dave...sounds yummy!'"". 
     Kelly  : ""Yeah, that's a good idea, but his name is Dan...""

6. -Driving with Dawn to the Penthouse Boutique, walk to the open door, look inside...ponder if it's open, but never go in. Only to find out it was open...and we should have gone in!


7. -My sister's beautiful wedding...nothing compares to seeing pure happiness on a loved one's face.

8. - All the bonding with Kim...slowly but surely, she's becoming the woman I've always looked up to.

9. - J j J J j Jenn-Unit!!!

10. -Finding out that my instincts were correct about certain people...now I know I can trust myself and gut instincts.

11. - All the hours and hours of video tape of me dancing...every minute shows how I grow as a dancer....and every minute expresses my happiness.

13. -Learning my value in a small family business...leading to learning how kick-ass I can be under pressure...and of course, earning the respect of all the chauvinistic assholes who have come in and have seen me work!

14. - My MAN!!! No matter the outcome, everything about him has been stupendous; he's taught me so much, mentally, emotionally, physically- such a wonderful being in a human package. Everything from his sparkling blues, to his GREAT ass...and his very soft touches...(if I had a dollar for all the times he's made me smile and/or laugh I'd be a billionaire)...all worth the very long wait...and I got him! 

15. - Last but not least, figuring out that I have matured...wanting to go back to being a child, but always looking forward to welcome whatever may come. Maturity doesn't announce itself when it comes...but one day it'll hit you, and a huge relief sets in. Almost as if someone told you a secret about yourself you'd never imagine hearing...on the positive side of course.

(***Ashley just reminded me that ""con carne"" is with meat, and ""con queso"" is with cheese...what a freudian slip! i love the meat i guess...haha! thanks girl!***)

you know who else is silly? that ridiculously sexy man whom I enjoy spending time with. he's great, i love his kisses...and much much more! 

on a more important note...since I got my tarot deck I've done six readings...well, more than that, but it was on six different heads. and thus far, all of the readings pretty much were applicable to the person's life. I'm not great with making connections because I'm never sure what the person is trying to find answers to, but I usually do a pretty good job at picking up on what they want to know by the end of the reading. 

it feels great to have people who support me in something I truly believe in...perhaps they are more or less just humoring me...either way, I like that they allow me to be me! 

i've got a cold right now...and i was pondering thru this past year, and i can't recollect another time that I was sick this year... i'm sure i was at some point...but if I wasn't, I almost made it through the entire year without any illness! go figure the last week of 2005 i get sick...but it's all good, because I'll still party like it's 1999~ haha! 

i'm looking forward to starting this new year....I get a clean slate from certain people whom I wish to keep out of my life. I also get a clean slate to start fresh with people I do want in my life. Usually a new year is just another year for me...but something within tells me that 2006 is THE year for me...there's something about my environmental surroundings that makes me believe I will be of significance this year...and I'm looking forward to the joys and burdens that may come with that significance! 

i'll always remember where i came from, and who i've been because it is what will help me stay on track in the future. i feel like ""Opportunity"" is coming in for a visit...and bringing all of his friends...

Our land was founded by a rapist, lying Spanish piece of shit-

Men in the world now, are lying raping pieces of shit...not necessarily Spanish.

""I didn't have to do that.""

Well it made me think about how, my loneliest times were when I was with someone. Probably because I never wanted to admit how disappointed I was with them.

Turns out, that his girlfriend had a baby either today or yesterday...so it looks like he was trying to recruit himself some ass, because his baby's mamma probably wasn't puttin' out during her 7th, 8th, 9th month of pregnancy! hahahaha! 

What's even funnier is that he thought I'd be saying no to him, because he figured I  had a boyfriend...maybe he should have just been thinking about his girlfriend, instead of worrying about me.

Knowing the difference between violated and cherished is a part of the learning process- or atleast in my life it has been. What I've learned is, when it's right your mind sits in peace. It does not do anything because your body has taken over, instinct takes over, and although our minds help seperate us from the animals- our animal instincts seperate the dogs from the men....the pussies from the women.

Every kiss sweeter than sugar.

He craddled me. 
Held me close. 
Letting me rest, letting me know where I'd be safe. 
As we sat there wrapped in each other's arms,
me listening to his pleasant heart-beat, 
I was never more thankful to have met him. 
A man, in every aspect of the word. 



I wish there were more of him...that way all the women out there can feel what I feel when he does what he does best- cherish."

"event","When I was 14, I thought I'd found the person who was second half to me. A very gorgeous individual, whom I despised when I was 8, but then grew on me. Not even grew...when I got to spend time with him, it hit me out of nowhere. Well, about a year ago I searched him on my travel blog. Although it was not him that came up, the man who did came up had a very special ""favorite song"" posted. It was the song that I pictured we'd make love to. By the way, I hate saying ""make love"" it sounds so corny and cheesey ... but that's what it would be if it happened. I thought it was a sign of destiny. A ray of hope for me to keep believing in him. Well, this morning, watching ""Serendipity"" the movie (which is fabulous) I thought of my second half again. I wondered why I stopped thinking of him to begin with. Why that doubt came about, and me losing the sweet love story I wanted to make my life. 

It's very disappointing to realize that I lost sight of something once so dear to me, and I don't even know why-"

"event","So, even though a certain someone...you know, that dumb faggot I wasted a lot of time on, thinks that I'M psycho...really he turns out to be. 

All of those ""Anonymous"" comments that were bad about me, were written by him, so that he can comment back and make himself look like he's defending me! HAHAHAHA--- last time I checked, talking to yourself was a sign of insanity, but I mean....typing back and fourth to yourself, that must be off the charts. Not only that, but he did it so that I would start talking to him again....since you know, he did defend me against himself. hahaha.

What a fucking weirdo! 

I think he was a lil' upset that he didn't mean shit to me in the long-run...which is probably why he would play games.  


hahahahahahaha.


You can find me in da club- at least for tonight!!!  Holla, Holla, Hollaaaa."

Me.


Been trying to clean my room...I'm making some progress...it's the big picture that counts.

I got my hair colored! It's awesome! I hate that colors fade ...  =o ( 

Let's see...what else...

Think my cartilidge needs a lil' break- how many times must I go through this??? 

MMmm that's so nice... lovin' my sweet kisses. 

Shackles have been released!! I feel like I lost 150 lbs. worth of rock off my shoulders. It feels so light and airy now; it comes with a modest peace. 

I can't believe this is what happiness feels like-"

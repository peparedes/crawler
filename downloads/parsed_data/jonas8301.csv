"event","i need to get a job making enough money so i can pay my insurance, cell, gas, and afford a place to live. today as i was laying comfortably in bed, i heard a discussion between my parents about all their ""shit"" with me, and from the sounds of it, especially my mother, they dont really want me. So i went downstairs and got my coat and keys and when they asked what i was doin i explained that they didnt want me here id leave so i did. where as they continued to call my phone but i wouldnt answer. oh how i should have killed myself all those times i really thought about it. would have been doing myself and others a favor. beyond other things, some people have made me rather mad this week. although one person getting me mad is savong me money so i cant complain in that sense. ive been playing a lot of euchre lately and i love that game. it is so good. and also another thing when i heard my parents talking, my mom was saying how she will get me christmas presents, but she isnt going to put a penny towards my trip to nyc so i now cannot go. well fuck her. i dont want any fucking presants from them any way and i am not going to speak to my parents any more. in fact i am so sick of it here i think once i do find a job i am just going to save and save and move somewhere else. prolly not though. well i am going to end my post just commenting on my madness at parents and a few other people. bye."

im gonna leave u with this:

""How stupid is it? I can't talk about it 
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart

For all I know you want me too and maybe you just don't know what to do or maybe you're scared to say: ""I'm falling for you"" 
I wish I could get my head out of the sand 'cuz I think we'd make a good team 
and you would keep my fingernails clean
but that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize 
'cuz I can't even look in your eyes without shakin', and I ain't fakin'

Another blade next to you from the ground
As the wind does pass
I notice as you feel the breath of my shout

Your words are kind
The kind that repeatedly say no
But that's alright
I'm older than you so I've got time

What have you said, reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time

We've all seen the bridge
A broken seam and a girl on one side
You think your words will work
They only work when you lay down and close your eyes

I thought of all the lines
All the right ones used at all the wrong times
But that's alright
Depression's just a sarcastic state of mind

here's to us fools
That have no meaning
I tip my glass to you
Let's toast the night away to friends
And forget about tomorrow

Everything that could have went wrong, went wrong this year. 
Nothing recently has made me want to stand up and cheer

Seeing you became a charm
And everyday, I wish I could
Everyday...

It's simple to you, so simple to lie
How many times I've tried
Blatant mistakes of your design

everything about you is a picture worth a thousand words. try as i may i try in vain. there's more to you than i could ever hope to explain. i don't think you know. i'll never be the same again. purity stood in front of me and said ""i'm clumsy and my back hurts"" and i thought ""you're about as beautiful as God's creation gets"" and i've seen oceans and sunsets that took away my breath. and you remind me of everything that's precious in His sight and i don't think you'll ever realize just how much you've touched my life. everything i thought i knew redefined in the light of you. though the white it burns my eyes. all my shadows fall behind me. i don't think you know why i'll never be the same. try as i may i try in vain. there's more to you than i could ever explain. i can't find the words for you 
-words for you by brandtson

sometimes i can't see beautiful. i need you to show me secrets. can you breathe, so i can hear you. say to me that you're not leaving. sad boy flies and comes down broken. realize that i can't without you. cloudless blue inside of your eyes. it's so much clearer when i'm with you. nowhere else is where i want to be. and when you're gone i'll always know where you are. just think of me and i will you. 
-holly park by brandtson

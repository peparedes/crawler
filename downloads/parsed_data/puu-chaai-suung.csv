"event","My Feelings on the girl that 

The way a feel about Katie is almost undescribable, She owns my heart without ever doing anything to deserve it. 

I've know Katie since 8th grade we met on a trip to Washington D.C. & N.Y.
I'm not really sure how we came to talk, I wish I could rember. I really dont even rember how we ended still talking when we came back from the trip, again I wish I could. But we continued talking, I think the first time we went out was at the being of freshman years, I rember this because I think that we where going out when the twin towers went down. I rember once driving back from seatle and making out in the back seat of her sisters car, I donno why but thats probly the earlyest and most vivid memory I have of us together. I've always like kissing her from the first time I did it though. Even though it is kinda sloppy most the time, which I do blame on her because I dont have that problem with any one else, I still have more emontions come to me when I kiss her then with any one else. I told her one day that every time I kiss her I fall more in love with her, it sounds like a line and it kinda was/ kinda wasnt at the time, but now that I reflect on it one of the truest things I've ever told her, with every kiss I'm drug into something I dont know if I wanna be in but I just cant help myself.
But we broke up sometime when I was in sprind crew, dont rember the date though. I broke up with her, I dont really know if there was a good reason or not, but its hard dating some one that you dont see very often, even more so at the age, and make something out of it. It was probly one of the hardest things I've ever done, I rember how much it tore my heart out to hear (i did it over the phone) how much pain it coused her. We didnt talk for a long time after that, I had hurt her quite a bit. I'm not sure when or why we started talking again, I'm sure I was the one to call her, I always seem to be. We talked on and off thruogh sophmore year, and then we started becoming good friends again junior year. Im not really sure when I started to love this girl who knows maby it was from the first time I met her, but it was around this time that I relized how much I love her and it always seems to be growing no mater how much I wish I could squash it some times.
It was around this time that she came outta her shell and started doing the ""high school"" thing. Going out and getting drunk, smoking some pot, doing one or two other miss. drugs. I dont know though there might be more stuff along thoughs lines I dont know about. But it was kinda funny because she was the most strait laised person I had ever met. When all this started it mellode her out alot, she use to stress about everthing. (Thats onther weird thing about us being friends im the complete oposite of her in almost all of her actions) She also decided to start her sex life around this time. I wont get into thoughs details but there was a slight problem with that for me being she didnt inform me and put me in a situation where it would have been nice to know (not that it matters) but theres a difference between taking some one you loves v-card and just having sex with them, she didnt see this I guess. But we have just with the last few months had sex together the first time we did I really wish I could take back because I just dont really feel all that great about it, but then as I think about it Im glad I did for my own personal reasons I wont get into because there kind of a cruel self justification. We also had sex one other time. I'm not all the pleased with my performance either time because I know I can do way better.

I really wish I could put into words all the things I feel for this girls, and after writing that it seems like for the most part there all good, but really there not I have alot of...hate...(it was the first word I thought of to describe it so I'll use it) for her that acompanys the love the whole way. really when it comes down to it she treats me like shit alot of them time she just pulls stupid ass shit on me that I wouldnt put up with from any buddie else, But I always at the end of the day think god I wanna call and just talk to Katie just to talk to her. I mean how many people or friends with some one that says ""yah I cant beleive your still my friend after the way I treat you either"" I mean fuck I hate it. I'm trying to think of all the things that make me mad about her but I cant its just alot of little small things that cute deeper and hurt more then the big deals I wish for so I could hate her and get her outta my head. She 

Saturday night Laysee (sp) told me that me and Katie would get married some day, and for the first time in a long time I found myself doubting it, I didnt really have a reason, I know in my head I was thinking she probly wont ever marry, that was my reason for saying it probly wont happen, but deep down in side it was for a reason I couldnt figure out I just felt it wouldnt happen.

I dont know why I feel so much for her I know and have had sex with girls that are way better looking, but im still atracted to her. I mean dont get me wrong I am physicaly atracked to her, and she is a beuatiful girl. 

This is the way I feel towards her though so If any one reads this and thinks im abosest with her I'm not. This is my example: Like when I saw her saturday night, I wasnt jeuoles and I never really am of the guys shes with. But the when I saw the guy she was with and from what I had heard of him I just thought you know she could find some one thats better for her(who knows i donno know the guy)he looked like hang out with him was hangin out with a high school fucking meat head, and hes what 20 I think and still kickin it at hight school partys and shit I mean come on. Shes a fucking smart girl with a good damn intellect, which he didnt look to have much of. So I guess what I'm saying is I dont mind her being with other people and it doesnt make me all the jelous (i wont lie though i mean some times it does.) I just dont like seeing her with guys I dont think are good anuff for her. But I know its not my place to say anything. 

But hell I donno guys what to think boyd i wish i could just sit down and wallo in self pitty and bitch to you for a little while about it.

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK I have so many thoughts about her That I cant even fucking write them all down I just wish I didnt fucking have any for her I hate her as much as I love her and its been that way since day one I wont to grab her up in my arms and hold her and keep her safe for ever and at the same instance that I'm thinkin turn your back on her your the one who calls her who keeps her your friend its one sided she doesnt want it walk away and leave her to the wolfs. I've been so close to that fucking point with this girl and yet as I open my arms to let her go they close just as fast. WHY DOES ONE STUPID FUCKING GIRL MESS WITH ME SO GOOD DAMN MUCH, I HATE IT I FUCKING HATE EVERY THING ABOUT US GOD I JUST WANT TO FORGET SOMETIMES THAT I EVER HEARD THE FUCKING NAME AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!

Sorry If some one really read all this it was for myself I had to get it out theres so much more I just cant get out over this compture and so much emotion that I cant express. Sorry because this entry is just my ramblings on one stupid girl, but seeing her saturday when I hadnt planned on it through me off gaurd, it didnt help that she looked so good either. I hads thought that a realation ship was all but at end because I had finaly called her on her bullshit and was trying to push her outta my heart, but now after seeing her its no longer my heart again."

But I never wrote about endfest so I figure I should. It was sick eco and the bunny men was probly the only show I didnt enjoy, Yeah yeah yeah's fucking rocked, Idiot Pilot was so good probly my fav. just because it was on the seattle stage. Muse put on a really good show it was just to early though. Smoke alot of pot it was intense. Thats about it.

So yesterday I bought a Jones because I walked past them and I was like I should drink one in boyds memory. It was good.

I saw Katie saurday night, it was after her home coming, she look so amazing it made my heart hurt. Her date kinda looked like a meat head dumb ass with not a lick of intelect, but what ever if she likes that kinda guy. I really just dont know how I feel about this girl any more, I dont like that some one has so much pull on me when they dont really even deserve it. It scares me because I know I'd do anything she ever asked me to anything, and I'd do it without question.
I just really dont know what to fucking think of her I wish I had boyd here to help me right now he has always been the guy I talk to about girls and it always seem to be the right advice. Theres just so many pros and so many cons to her that I cant even being to think clearly on the mater some times I hate you more then anything Katie and at the same fucking time my hearts breaking because I'm mad at you. Fuck I hate myself sometimes.
I hade a pretty good time with katies friend Laysee (sp? i donno but thats how its pronouced) shes a cool girl I've met her a couple of times but never really talked to her, but we hung out satuday night for a bit. Didnt really do anything all the exciting hung out with some of her friends that I've met before,it was fun.

I started working at the hockey games this weekend it was fun saw alot of people i know so that was cool i think that i'll be able to find something to do after all the games just because of the amount of people i see there that i know.

Thats about all for now I guess I'm going to try and update everyday so If I dont get on me about it guys."

I'm kinda fucked right now I dont know how I'm going to graduate, But I'm going to do it fuck going to school for any longer.

"event","<P>So I havent really been up to much latly schools almost out for me, but its just the same old story all over again passing a few failing a bunch. For some reason I dont really care though, you may think that I dont care because I dont understand the consiquences but I fully do, more then most people who do good in school understand them. For some reason I just dont act, its not that I dont care....i guess its just that I'm indiffernt about it. <BR>Today was pretty stressfull I've been reading this 400 page book since friday (didnt read on saturday had to work) and it was the slowest I've evere read it took me an hour to read 20 pages, but I fully understood what I was reading it was just slow. Its a good book though its called <EM>The Moonstone. </EM>Its writin kinda weird but good book. Back to the point though I was reading for my step-bro so he could graduate and had to have it done by today, and I still had 100 pages to go. It all worked out in the end but a few people almost died by my hands while I was trying to finish it.<BR>I was sober this weekend which isnt a big deal but I thought that I would point that out to the person who informed me that my life was going to hell. Thanks but I'm good. Havent smoked for a few days and havent smoked tuff for even longer then that. It's weird my heads pretty clear, but I'm led to believe that I have A.D.D. because I've had way more engery for stupid shit then I do when I smoke. I need a 20 bag damn.<BR>Schools out friday and I'm outta Everett on saturday night or sunday morning till the weekend after that. And then thats going to be my schedule for the summer. If any one wants to go to the most relaxing place that I know of come spend a week with my up at my grandparents and you'll never wanna leave. Let me know if you wanna, there on a lake, theres horse riding, shooting...ect. hella fun stuff to do and some of the prettest places I've ever seen. They got like 20 beds in there place and love to have company. And when there gone its the best place to have a party. Almost done I donno if I'm coming back after this year, so we should all hang out this summer and become good friends because if not we might never speak again.<BR>I got a new car&nbsp;today (new to me) its an ok care kinda ungly but it runs good. Any one wanna hot box it with me just let me know you know I'm down. I gotta go get insurance tomorrow on it I hope it wont be to much. We'll see.<BR>Boyd we still gotta hang out some time you fucking bitch, you've been back for ever and I havent even really talked to you.<BR>Katie I think that you read this and if you do when we going to have sex because you told me that we where going to so....dont lie about more stuff. ""When we have sex...not if, <U>WHEN</U>"" those where your words not mine. haha just giving you shit, but we do need to hang out, also you are coming with me to my grandparents for a couple of days this summer even if I have to kidnap you. love you kid.<BR>P.S. rember the turkey that I got you in Mexico, we have one at my house and my mom calls it Katie's turkey. I think that my mom likes you more then me, but thats ok because yours likes me more!</P>"

We'll this phone call was from the last person in the world I was exspecting to call me. It was Kristin, yes thats right the girl from Kenowick. She called me and just seemed to want to talk to me...weird...yes very weird. She told me about her boyfriend and how there not going to get married now, she was like how come you never call me? You took my verginity and now you dont call me for 5 months. I was think hey wasnt it you who broke up with me. I think she mostly called because shes sick of her goody goody boyfriend because all she pretty much did was bad mouth him to me. Then she asked if I was going up to the cabin this summer and shit like that. I was just really weird to hear from here like that, but then again she is morman by choice. Who know maby she thinks shes going to get a summer flig again...I dont think I would go through it all again, but then again I am week to the flesh."

I wish that I updated more, I think the reason I dont is because I'm not home very much and when I am im tired and dont feel like writing much.

I'm hopefully going to get a new car this week sometime and then get insurance on friday when I get paid. I wanna get a kinda nice car, that is nice on the inside it can be shitty on the outside because then people will think its crap and not fuck with it.

I need to find a girl that I can be chill with hanging out with alot, I dont really need a girl friend. I just want a girl that doesnt act like a fucking high school bitch and...being in high school I havent been able to find one. I think that I'm just use to hanging out with older people. I want a girl thats down to chill without talking about a bunch of high school drama, and or gossip about whats going on there. I fucking hate when people talk shit about other people to me if its not warrented, why do people need to talk shit just to talk shit.

I sad because all my friends at LSHS are outta school soon and then it'll be back to knowing no one again. I guess they'll still be the girls though so that wont be so bad after all.

I think that im going to put some pics on in a bit.

Friday night I got really drunk and for the first time dont rember the whole night...kinda weird beings how I've drinkin like 3 4 times as much and not been so drunk. I think its because I didnt eat much all day. I had to 40's of OLDE E, probly the grosses beer I've ever had. It was a fun night though from what I rember. Found out Becca's a good kisser. I guess I was standing out in this guys yard taking a piss talk to Oliva but I dont rember that...good times. The shitty part to all this is I wake up the next morning to go to work and I'm still drunk (which isnt that bad) But I get to work and then start feeling like shit. I cant say its the worst hang over I've had but working with a hang over fucking sucks! I felt like shit till about 3 (I started working at 10) when I walked out the back and puke in the parking lot which made me feel like 100% better. I found out last night I puked in my bed to which I really dont rember. But it was only on my top blanket so I washed it today. I feel like a pussy getting so fucked up so easy though."

I need to get a car that works I dont know how I ever live without a car I think that I'm going to go crazy with out one. This is because mine is broken if you didnt know, and the more I think about it the more I dont want to put money into getting it fixed because theres abunch wrong with it. My mom said that she'd give me $1,000 for a car though, which was kinda outta the blue. I dont know if I wanna take her money like that though, plus its alot of money and i'd kinda feel bad, but I think that Robin makes good money at his new job so... I donno I'm going to think about it. I dont know if I wanna go to my grandparents for the summer or stay here, wait I want to go up to my grandparents for the summer but if I stay here I think that I'll be able to make more money, that would be about the only plus to staying here other then the fact that Boyd will be here. I could list things all day for going up to my grandparents, but theres still things about staying here that way heavy in the decision. I was talking to my mom and I said I wish that I could be a little kid and grown up all at the same time, and she looked at me and said ""I'm 45 and I still wish that."" I love my mom to death but I dont wanna be saying that when I'm that old. I wanna be happy with being old I hope that it comes and soon anuff for me to enjoy it. I think that I want to travel around the world when I get out of high school, I was reading what Boyd wrote about the more you know the more ignorent (spelling) you become, I think that it is the truest statement I've ever heard because the more I see and learn the less I feel I know its like the more knowlegde I try to get the bigger the vode of what I see I dont know grows and I hate it. I want to get out and see what its like out side of my ""bubble"" I want to just buy a one way ticket some where and get off the plane and just loose my self and come out again reborn into something that I want to be. Right now I dont know what that is, I dont even have an idea of what that is. I wont let myself get stuck in some job I hate raising a family (that I hopefully love) hating what I've made of my life. I'd reather die trying to find what it is I want to become, then to live and be what I dont want to be."

Friday night just kinda kicked it got laid so that was nice thats about it though.
Saturday: kicked it during the day, My mom took me out to dinner which was nice. I got a dig. camera and it takes pretty nice pictures, but we'll see how they print out. Almost got towed in Seattle and had to pay my $140 to not have it towed which left me with 0 dollars. 
Sunday just kinda kicked it at moms and then came home at like 9.

"event","So its been a while since I've updated sorry guys. I dont think to many people really read this any ways so its all good. I havent been up to that much latly, I've got alot of friends at Lake Stevens now, I finaly meet a group of kids that I like to hang out with. Been working a bit latly not as much as I'd like but oh well I guess. I've been fucking off to much at school so this week im going to work my ass off and get ontop if it. Still no girl friend. I think that mine and katies relationship is now perinatly fucked. I think we'll still be friends but I dont think that I'll ever be able to hold her in the same regaurd any more. 

Story: So last night I called Katie and asked her if she wanted to spend the night with me (she comes over once and a while and spends the night with me its never been any sexual though) and so she comes over and what not (oh side note Alison came over to my house in everett before Katie came over and we smoke. Lake Stevens kids can not find there way around a city its sad.) and we hang out for a bit and talk then we lay down in bed a chill for a bit and then we started making out (not a huge deal it happens with us from time to time.) but she had made some comments earlyer that with what was going on with us at that time made me relize that it could progress alot ferther then making out. So totaly against every action I've ever made, I stop. On the grounds that Katie is a virgin and I dont know if I should be the one to take it from it. (again never had that problem before, If you know me you know I like the vergins.) So we get to talking a little and I make the comment that she so inocent and I feel kinda bad. She goes how am I inocent and I say for one your a vergin, and then informs me that she is not. Now note that I've know her since 8th grade and I koncider her one of my best friends. So is it not alright for me to be a bit pist that she didnt inform me that she wasnt a vergin when she knew full well that I was almost 100% sure that she was. Because she couldnt fucking figure out why I'm mad even after I explained it to her. Now I wouldnt have a fucking problem with having sex with her if I had known that she wasnt a vergin. GOD DAMNIT what a fucking time to care about some one see if I do that shit again.

On another note I dont think that I'm going to make my goal of 10 by 18 now but you never know I still got 5 days.
I'm really scared for Boyd at his school ""violence begets violence"" I think the saying goes or close to. And it just seems that ever violent act at his school goes unchecked giving the agreesor more power every fight at a time. I know that Boyd under all his calm and peacefulness is tuff as me, if not more so when it comes down to it.  I only hope if anything happens Boyd will have the upper hand I wish that I could be there to have his back and if there was any way possible I'd be there with a fucking arcinal.

Well I'm going to try and update alot more from now on I just havent been at a comp alot latly.

I hope that a certan person doesnt forget a promise for what there supose to get me for my b-day but they probly will so I wont hold my breath. I guess you find out what you really mean to people some times.

I'm almost 18 hell yah its going to be fun."

So I come home from work today to find some pictures on the kitchen table, there of a baby, I'm like oh hey guys whos kid is this, there like Jess's (my bro) baby, me ""bull-shit"" them ""yes"" me ""bull-shit whos are they"" you get where this is going. So I'm an uncle now. CRAZY.

So on the way home guess who I happen to see. JUSTINA. I was going across across 92 and I look over (like always to check out the girls) and who do I see, so I honk and she looks over. We met up and talked for a bit, sorry things are shitty. Then came home where the above stated events happened. Jess came over and we talked for a bit, It was cool. I have respect for him hes getting his shit together and I think that hes up to the challange. Its weird I've known him longer then any one else, though it doesnt really seem like that.

Got my tux today for prom. I hope that it goes well. Hopefully Rebecca's still cool because we havent really talked. Shes got my # and I dont really feel right calling her....because shes has a boyfriend...yah. I think I mighta jumped the gun on this but all I really want outta the Prom is to have a good time...that doesnt include sex..if you where wondering...its just an added bonus.

Some stuff that seems weird to me has though but I dont feel like writing about it. I'm going to ask this gitl named becca to prom, I'm pretty sure shes going to say yes, its kinda weird though because she has a boyfriend, but so far that hasnt seemed to be a problem, I feel kinda bad about that. I got her a little present to ask her with, I think that she will like it, its kinda a funny gift and to otheres it might seem kinda stupid, but we'll see how it goes. So we have late start for the next to weeks at school so thats tight. Works been work, I have to be carefull about how I talk about people though, because peopel bitched to my boss, but he was cool about it to me, he likes me I'm one of the hardest workers there so he really likes me. Schools starting to get alot better because I'm starting to get in with the ""cool"" crowed, and so I'm getting to know alot more people. Proms going to be on the 8th of May, so I really gotta start saving my penny's. Hmm...maby I'll be able to get a six pack by then, it would be a plus for after the dance. I think that I'll be working alot because I asked for more hours so I can have a big check so I have money for prom. I need to find a girl that I can have a realationship with...hmm sooner or later I guess."

We started drinking about 8:30 at Vickeys house, we where there for like an hour and then the sober one drove us to seattle. There for like an hour I thought it was tight but no one else really did, hot collage girls there. So we went back to Vickeys house, and drank alot more there where a bunch of people there that I didnt know and a few that I've met before. I was alot of fun. Smoked alittle bud which was VERY nice. Then just chilled/slepted from like 3:00am to 5:30am and then got a ride home to sleep some of the drunkness off. Got up at about 8:30 and finished off being drunk as I got ready for work. Got to work about 10:00am and worked till 8:00pm long ass day. plus tips SUCKED!
Then got some bud from a new found source from.... Saw Anna which was tight I havent seen her in forever. She looks pretty good, shes in pretty good shape I was suprised. ;) and today I cut the grass at my moms and helped the neighbor lady dig a garden, I made 15 bucks so thats tight. Then I worked and that was not to bad. I got Bannana flavored joint papers they are the coolest things ever."

Saying something and wishing you hadn't?, or 
Saying nothing and wishing you had? 
I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say. Don't be

>If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs. 


Have u ever decided not 2 become a couple because you were so afraid of 
losing what you already had with that person? 

Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't. 
You can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own.! .......when you 
least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to. 
Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other 
person was too afraid to let you? 

Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too 
much...for fear< /SPAN> that the other person does not care as much, or even at all. 

Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection 
was too hard to handle? 
We tell lies when we are afraid! ... afraid of what we 
don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found 
out about us. 
But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger. 
Life is all about ! risks and it requires you to jump. 
Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would 
have done, or could have had. 
What would you do if every time you fell in love you had to say good-bye? 
*What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be 
there? 
*What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to 
tell them how you felt? (even if it is that you don't care anymore) 
*What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't! have 
them? 
*What would you do if you never got the chance to say I am friends with all 
of my fam! ily and they know I love them? *

Went to every class but 6th because I was supose to work out with a certain some one who cancled on me, but its my fault because I didnt check my phone before I left because she did leave me a message. So I worked out a bit by my self. Then my dad got ahold of me and told me to come home because he got my progress report which I dont think was that bad because I was only failing one class and that was because I missed a test in that class which I get to make up. Sweet. Then my dad said I couldnt drive and I was like im leaving peace and left. Went and hung out with Lindsay for like 45 and gave her back her sis's hat, which I want because its pretty tight. Then I went to the Alderwood Mall and got two new shirts and a hat, there pretty tight. I had a $25 off a $50 or more purchase so that was tight. Missi was working and when I was buying my stuff she took her break and got a prezel, I'm starting to think she eats alot of them...hhmmmm. We talked for a few and then she went back to work. In less then 2 hours shes going to be 18, crazy. I've know her since she had just barly gotten her lisences, and now shes all grown up...haha. I still dont know what her tattoo is going to be, I bet it'll be cute though. That girl confusses me way to much for my own good, some times. So my dad said that he wasnt going to let me drive tomorrow and I laughed and told him that I wasnt going to school then because I'm not taking the bus, I dont think that he liked that all that much, but what ever I could really fucking care less because hes being pig headed. I'll probly drive tomorrow, I'm sure I will I gotta work lol. Still looking for that ""ONE"" girl if any ones found some one yet let me know..., or if any one is that one PLEASE let me know.

So I went to the beach for a bit and saw a few people that I new there. Then I went and got Jack In The Box and went to EHS to get some stuff outta my locker. Then it was off to work...fun times since I was supose to work 3-7 and ended up working till like 9:10 and they had me clock in 20 min early. So I had to work hella today, but its all good because that means more money in my pocket. I didnt get to work out today so that kinda makes me mad but I dont have to work tomorrow, so I'm going to work out tuff then. I think that I'm going to go up to the alderwood mall also and go to Pac Sun and use the 25 dollar thing I got for there. fun fun. Missi needs to let me know If where working out tomorrow. If you read this give me a call and let me know. Well thats about all the fun of my day. I'm starting to get a good tan, and yah its real thats right all you fake tanners out there."

I stole a really cool hat from this girl though I dont rember her name I think its Linsay or something I donno all I know is that it starts with an L. That was about it for schoool. Oh wait Kathy brought me and Jess Qizno's for launch that was good I like that place, I use to not like it but now I do. Then after school I went into Everett and talk with my sis for a bit, shes back living with me mom, I dont really understand all the reasons behind it other then her boyfriend got tired of living together, what ever not my problem. So then I went for a run came home took a shower and went to work. Work was alright closing kinda made me mad though because Keylee is hella slow at closing now I know why she doesnt do it much. She was like an hour late to she thought that she wasnt working today. So Jay covered untill she got there, hes fun to work with preson to work with him and Job (Joeb) are both really fun to work with. Im dreading working saturday its going to be so long I havent work for 8 hours in for ever.

"event","I just came to the pot induced relization that I NEVER talk about boyd! I only talk about whats going on HERE. I miss boyd hella. Every time that I go near his house I think hey I should swing by. And then I'm like oh wait I cant because theres no Boyd there (this is the same Boyd that hasnt so much as had a new phone number since I've known him) is no longer there. I've almost gone by a few times to say hi to his mom. I always thought that she was really nice to me, even if all she wanted to do was get rid of me. I some times wonder if she new more about what was going on then she ever let on, and when I think this I wonder if she is just a very un understanding person in un understanding situation. (spelling, im high) If that makes sence it does to me lol). But even though I miss Boyd I'm kinda happy that he's where hes at to. Dont take me wrong I wish that I could have my best friend here to talk to and hang out with. It will just be something aswome to be able to look back on later in life. Hey and you never know it might be better to live there in a few years with the way the this counrty seems to be going. I think about him every day I had some of my funnest times with that kid, and some of the stupidest times. (smoking movie stubs ring a bell?) I found some pictures of Boyd, Jeremy W., and me at camp silvertin in like 5th grade. It made me laugh. I had forgoten all about going there."

"event","And now for today: Today was a long day I was really tired for some reason, I think yesterday was just a long day. School was school, but I found out that there not excusing the bomb threat day, FUCKING GAY who want to come to school if they might get blown up! But what ever. So after school I went and worked out with Missi again. She seems to be a really good work out partner which is kinda suprising, She doesnt let me rest long she just keeps going and going which is a good way to work out. Maby its just because shes using 8 pounds and I'm using 35 pound weights. hmm that just might be it.  ;) j/k kid. I did alot of abs today so I'm that much closer to a 6 pack. But I didnt have to work so thats all that happend today so far."

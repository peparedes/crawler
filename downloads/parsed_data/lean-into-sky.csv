I've been sleeping in my head. I'm not feeling. Lost teacups, no love.  Phase shifting is something I never thought I'd miss. There are places and certain kinds of people you never thought you'd want back, but I want them back; I need them. Why is it that I ruin good things because of fear? Humility is pathetic and it's what I'm made up of. There's a consistancy of where I end up everytime the temperature drops. And I can't say it's typical when nothing has really changed. Lacking in everything and everyone I need, I dream too much and I create different lives. With different people all characters of comfort, even my own. Capible of laughter, of talking, of taking care, of love.

pretty pretty weather, we danced together, under the sun, just for fun.
walk along the path; we sing. to dance. we bring the happiness.
""<i>Dolor</i>ance!,"" we'll say, ""come join us, come play!"" and then be on our merry way.
we'll trade stuff, until we have enough, never fret, never puff.
""What's this?"" she'll bring the finer things. like linen made all up in Purple.
and so we do, what we're meant to, and turn her frown, up-side-down.
and sing, and sing, and sing.



i love you, i love you, i love you, i love.

"event","it&#39;s been a couple of years since i last read my previous journals(keeping them for moments like these) i have significantly aged... haha kidding. i thought it was really amazing that i &quot;happened&quot; to read my old xanga today. (inverted commas cos this isn&#39;t a mere coincidence) went for allsouls bible study today and what impacted me most(haha the whole prog is called impact, witty) was being really excited and thrilled for God. and my many years ago self is the epitome of that. i really couldn&#39;t recognise myself through those blog posts, it&#39;s like i&#39;m reading some girl&#39;s life as a third person, and she&#39;s really really on for God, which makes me kind of... jealous hahaha... k not really jealous, more like envious. and encouraged too, to see such child-like faith, so close yet so far. so close cos it&#39;s personal, so far cos... it ironically doesn&#39;t feel like me, at all. so it gave me this weird feeling. and i&#39;m abit embarrassed that i&#39;ve had more than one post which go along the lines of &#39;ok i will start anew and this will hold me accountable&#39; but i strongly feel that i&#39;ve progressed thus far, maybe not in terms of starting anew with God but.. in other ways like growing in character and a deeper understanding of my mighty saviour. probably hasnt been the most ideal path to take, always going back to square one with my r/s with God, but i want to hold onto the belief that every step i take is what God uses to mould me and it is never wasted. i may have deviated somehow but it&#39;s just another, stormier, way to God. let me digress slightly: i watched &quot;whip it&quot; and &quot;hanna&quot; on the way to London abt 5 weeks ago and they really inspired me to be a stronger person, in general. mental, emotional, even physical.

"event","I think I am not someone who easily accepts others' authority unto my life, whether God-sent or not. Especially when he/she hasn't earned my respect, and usually in my terms. I&nbsp;know this isn't how I&nbsp;should be but I really can't help it. And with all the supremacy that our society has created, it makes loving the unlovable exponentially hard. It has really caused me to zoom in on every flaw of these people (authority in my life) and only their faults (which most of the times you have to agree, outweighs the other qualities that I've conveniently missed out). I learnt something new everytime i read a chapter of The Shack and two days ago, it was on this topic of leadership, hierarchy, etc. God said he didn't make us to live in such a hierarchical system. No such thing as a more dominant figure in a group, not even in a relationship (marriage was specifically mentioned, and for the many reasons I can understand why). When you love each other with God in the centre of it all, who needs a leader? This is how we're made to be, perfect beings who love God and love people perfectly, before the events in the Garden of Eden that is. It's quite revolting how we can thwart God's intentions to such an extent. Anyway that was some digression, so the main point was my problem with submitting to authority... I'm trying.. still!"

"event","It really shocks me (flabbergasted ahaha) when I see how time can so easily/effortlessly take away some of our most beautiful moments/quality/etc. How passion can become a dying flame, more often than not becos it's been trampled on again and again. But passion, zest, is the test of this trampling and beating, isn't it? I'm not even talking about years, it's just a mere few months that the tables are turned, and against who I really want to know. And with all humility I'm searching for the answers to all the doubts that are flooding over me right now, knowing full well time has taken its toll on me once again. No shit I'm trying on the outside, everyone sees it. But really, do I believe, do YOU believe? Right now I believe that the journey is still the crux of everything, not really the ultimate result, nor how much we've fared as compared to _______(fill in the blanks) It deeply saddens me to see that we're not taking the process into our hands, the process that will be the one that I will hold close to me when I've played my last hand. It frustrates me to see this zeal dying, this<em> love</em> dying. ACUltimate, we are a family, we are a family. Why think abt the results when we're not even holding each others' hands."

It also shows me how God goes to all great lengths to reach out to every single lost soul out there, at the same time growing and nurturing His tool of reaching out. I went one big round to realise that I can save this soul, and it's worth it, every single soul is worth chasing after. This is my purpose now, I want to fulfill His purpose for me. <em>I will run the good race that I've trained for</em>"

And that is if you're like one of those Japanese people eating sushi preventing cancer living healthy. 80 years seem like quite a lot but the number of days, not so. Siewluan shared with me today about her calculations and it was really quite a scary thought and, we've lived quite a bit of that 29000 odd days already. But anyway the teaching was about joy in God every single day, and that's not really what I want to comment on right now(feeling a lack of joy right now and quite lazy to move out of this state, at the mo) so, that's just sort of a fun fact for ya'll, not really fun though....

Kind of embarrassing:(<br />Reminds me of Lit class today (not really related but...) we wrote thesis statements and one of them was about childhood, etc. Haha, think about my adolescence. I&nbsp;think it's kinda harrowing to a certain extent, of course not in ways that involves abuse and traumatic experiences of sexual awakening. But it sure did seemed rather depressing from my accounts on previous blogs/written journals. Why haven't I&nbsp;recalled many joyful moments of my life? (That's excluding the period when I first accepted Christ in Sec2, oh that was overflowing joy though) Those recorded were always unhappy moments and tormenting emotions. I&nbsp;was probably a budding teenager who just wanted to let the world know I&nbsp;am &quot;sophisticated&quot; too with all those feelings stirring in my tangible heart, not realising how stupid I appeared to be. And I guess, this is the new age adolescence which is subtle but very real as well. And you could be sooo consumed in it you don't even know what true joy is anymore.<br /><br />Omit the above if it's too long, well I'm glad that part of my life is over? I am. And I'm on the next phase, perhaps I'll look back again, and learn more about myself some few more years down the road. Well, at the meantime, I&nbsp;want to capture happy moments in my life and embrace even more happy moments:) And God? I'm sorry and I want to stop putting you on hold. So, I am going to try (again!). Thank God(You) I am never lost to You.

Well, neither one of us deserves the blame, 
Because opportunities moved us away. 
It's not an easy thing to learn to play 
A game that's made for two--that's you and me.
The rules remain a mystery. 
See how it's easy?

I don't think I've been up to much lately besides Unstoppable Youth camp and Ultimate camp right after that. Haha this is kind of a pointless post because I realised I don't have a reason to post I just had to click the post button. So kiddos, it's a Sunday, and what's a Sunday without some csi?? Seeeeeya"

"event","&quot;but before you do, you must be the best in everything. that's the minimum requirement to quit life.&quot; -Favourite!!(Louisa)<br />and we are all imperfect, therefore i am not the best at everything, evidently... and thus i am not qualified to quit this life. and tell me, who in this damned world is??<br />i've come to think about it and in general: youth, they say, is a struggle. (then when we all get older into life, it'll be: life is a struggle) i've never had so much power struggle, so much struggle to learn, so much struggle to strive, so much struggle <em>not to be second</em>. so much so i'd like to withdraw from this race called life.<br /><br />then i thought about quitting itself. quitting, i've done it so many times i can barely remember. quitting on passion, quitting on drive, quitting during prolonged tennis points, quitting during painful runs, quitting on god, quitting on hope, quitting on giftings, quitting on..... look at it, my life is full of disqualifications, and i still don't learn the lesson on quitting.&nbsp;<br /><br />i still hate being second btw."

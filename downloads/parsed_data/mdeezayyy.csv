"event","mannyy manyyyy things;

vegan=no more, how my body is and due to my arthritis i need alot more protein and that. so im gonna have to put veganism on the back burner for a few months to a year. but i will end up being one again. i felt alot better about that.

School= senior year, and im confused on what to do. Nurse or cosmetologist. either one is something i know i would be good at. i just wish i knew what would exactly be best for me and my future plans. Fashion design would be way too hard to get a job around here. and i want to stay in MI. so either i'll be doing hair or I'll be drawing blood...Maybe Both

Friends= first of all. don't screw them over. and lie to them, when two other people know exactly what you did. to put it nicely i hope you choke. =)


Enemies=DAMNNNN i got alot of those now. i quit on being the girl that takes all this shit. i don't give a fuck anymore. and People are obviously getting to know that. =) 

Health=i gained weight. no big deal i suppose. as long as i can still fit into size 5 jeans and wear small clothes. im good. =) 

Past- Ten Bucks said you never would have known in 8th & 9th Grade i Weighed 180 something pounds. and 5 more bucks says you think i have an ed. truth is. Excercise Bulima. Just work off all the calories after eating them. i still do it. i know its still and ed. but not as hardcore as others. I hate my past. and i hate who i was. I never deserved the teasing and all of that. nice people who are quiet and fat never get the right kind of attention. but its my past. i can deal with it.

Love-Victor is My Life. my soulmate. i love how we pretty much have our future decided. like were we are going to live. and how big our house will be. im excited for all of it. I Love Him so Damn Much.


but enough of rambling. this made me feel better. =)

i loveyou hunny.

im doing my hair tommarroww yay!"

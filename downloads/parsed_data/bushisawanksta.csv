Huh? What's the deal?"

"event","<strong><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""3"">Yo!<br /></font></strong>Haven't really posted anything lately, but ya know what? GET OVER IT! .... yeah....<br />Right now it is raining outside, I'm at the&nbsp;desk in Curves, listening to Cher crap remix music, but trying to listen to the rain instead. I'm listening to my thoughts and all those things going on in my head&nbsp;too, but I try to block them out so I don't start crying. I never realized how much&nbsp;I love living here and how&nbsp;amazing some of the people are. I'm going to miss so many of them&nbsp;so badly I don't&nbsp;dare think&nbsp;about it. Especially in public,&nbsp;because I might just&nbsp;burst into tears and then people would think I was some crazy schitzo&nbsp;lady or something. I love this area and&nbsp;it will always be part of my life.&nbsp;The people, the weather, the driving, the&nbsp;sites, everything. All of it I will miss with the deep regret.&nbsp;I <u>think</u> I know&nbsp;that if I don't move I will&nbsp;go back to being bored and depressed and&nbsp;missing Washington again. Except lately I've been thinking to myself, why am I moving? Really, what is the reason? What is&nbsp;my excuse?&nbsp;And to tell you the&nbsp;truth, I have no idea. When I think ahead to when I'm settled in Shoreline, I&nbsp;want to cry because I feel that I will be lonely and bored and out of place. I will not fit in with my family there. I am not a Christian and I am not someone to be molded to fit. I feel that if I refuse to&nbsp;do something I will make it completely miserable for myself and my family. If I refuse to go to church I will have no where to stay, I will have no way to get to work, I will have no one. No one except Catie and she has work and&nbsp;school. I won't have my&nbsp;Mom, I won't have my Maddie,&nbsp;my Alana, my Pader, my Teddy. No one. I will&nbsp;be alone. Completely alone and that's what I feel like right now. I feel that everyone is trying to distance themselves from me. I&nbsp;decide to move, it's a week before I move&nbsp;and I am making new friends and a guy&nbsp;tells me that he wishes I wasn't moving and kisses me. What am I to&nbsp;do?&nbsp;Say ""HEY EVERYONE! I'm not moving!"" Then they'll just see me as&nbsp;some poor&nbsp;undecided fool who has nothing, who can't stick with one decision, and then&nbsp;things will go back to the way they were before I made this fatefull decision to leave this place. It will all&nbsp;go back to me sitting at home, doing nothing.&nbsp;I won't have a job, I won't have school. People won't pay attention because, hey, I'm not moving. So what am I to do? Huh? What? I don't know, I don't think I'll ever know.&nbsp;<br />How do I say that I miss you already. And when I think of leaving you and&nbsp;possibly never seeing you again, it makes my&nbsp;heart hollow and my head spin, my eyes tearful and my breath fast.&nbsp;If I visit will I see you?&nbsp;<br />I wish I could forget it all."

"event","&nbsp;So today I woke up at about 2 it was nice. Then I ate some food and vaccuumed or however you spell it. That was cool.....
Then I took the dogs for a little walk. Came home showered super fast and got my shit together for some halloween parties we went to.
Then we left.
First&nbsp; we met one of moms friends and we were supposed to go walk around Fort Mason or somewhere. Moms friend had told us she would be staying in a youth hostel neat there, but what she ment is that she'd be staying there next week and she was actually staying in a hostel way far away in the down town part of SF so we drove everywhere trying to find it. While we were driving all around we drove past this guy walking&nbsp;up the sidewalk and I swear to god it was&nbsp;RYAN GOSLING! I wanted to stop but there was no where&nbsp;to pull over and there were a bunch&nbsp;of cars behind us. Sad huh? He was so hot.&nbsp;
So we got there and moms friend was a bitch and quite annoying so we didn't hang out with her long...thank goodness. And she isn't really moms friend because mom doesn't really like her. Well not anymore now that she's spent more time with her.
But while we were there I met this gorgeous german guy named Dierk(probably spelled that completely wrong) who has an internship somewhere in SF and had a friend visiting and staying at that hostel. He was so hot and I think he thought I was too so that made the visit with the crazy lady worth while.
Then we left and went to Laura and Toms party. Again it took us forever to find their place and we drove all over the other half of SF trying to find it. We finally found it and parking and it was a lot of fun. But then we made the mistake of leaving there early and going to Sinems party. It took us about an hour to find it and when we finally did, it took us another 45minutes to find parking so that was awesome. Then we had to walk about 30minutes to the location adn when we finally got inside it was really fucking lame. We didn't see anyone we knew so we used the bathroom-which was a toilet in a closet-and left. Then we came home and now I'm sad and bored =("

It was an issue that she really wanted because it had several interesting articles in it, but she never got it. We were puzzled to why she never got it because she had sent the subscription card in early enough. We thought maybe mom had forgotten to pay for the subscription so she renewed it. She was going to backorder the issue which would have cost $10 plus shipping or something, but they decided against it.&nbsp;<br />Today I wake up...late as always around 1 or 1:30...and I'm about to go for a walk in the pooring rain when I see that there's an issue of Scientific American on our patio completely soaked through. I go out, pick it up and set it down on our carpet inside the door and think how pissed Maddie's going to be when she gets home and sees it. Then I think nothing more of it.<br />Then when mom gets home I point it out to her and she asks what month it is. I hadn't checked earlier so I did. Oh and what'd'ya know! It's AUGUST!<br />So mom and I look at eachother and she says ""Maddie is going to go up there and rip Owen a new asshole!""&nbsp; Or something along those lines. Mom called Tom our landlord and talked to him and since we all know Owen is an aggresive asshole he told her to tell Maddie that if he does anything like reach for her, hit her or even gets in her face that Tom would be there within an hour with an evidtion notice. And the same for Maddie if she starts something. Blah blah blah. I don't want to type anymore. I'm going to go exercise.<br />yay.<br /></font>"

Mom and I are on our way home from a movie (Pan's Labyrinth)and we're talking about people getting stabbed with broken bottles(you'll just have to see the movie to know why or I'll tel you later) and she just casually mentions that she dated a guy in high school who had stabbed someone with a broken bottle. 
Not only that, but she was with him when he did it. She didn't SEE him do it, but she was in his truck while him and his friend went and faught some other guys after a kegger on some road in the middle of the woods....interesting huh?
YEAH! Sheesh!
She said at the party there had been some tention between her boyfriend(Jim) and this guy. 
After a while at the party they decide to leave. Jim's driving, my mother's in the middle and their friend Joe(one of crazy grandmas crazy nazi ex-boyfriend's sons) on the other side of her. The guy her boyfriend was not liking pulled up behind them with some friends. So Jim stopped and told mom to stay in the car, grabbed a bottle and him and Joe got out of the car......hm? I wonder what happened next?
While Jim and Joe were out fighting these guys mom just sat in the car and waited. I was just like ""WHY?! HOW!?"" I don't see how someone could just stay in the car when they knew that their boyfriend was outside fighting some guy. Wouldn't you, like, atleast stick your head out the window and ask them to stop or something? When I asked mom this, she was just "" Probably because I was half ass drunk...and because I didn't want to see guys fighting."" 
I was laughing soooo hard! 
But, if you are asking ""If she wasn't out there with them, how does she know he stabbed some guy with a broken bottle?""
Well, smart ass, she saw him take the bottle and the next week when she went to school Jim wasn't there and someone told her he was in Juvenile-whatever-you-call-it. 
So yeah.
My mother has dated a guy that stabbed some other guy with a broken bottle. And her best friend's dad was a Nazi...and his brothers were big huge scary BIKERS! No. Not Bicyclists. Bikers. As in Motorcycles!
Sheesh! My mother is crazy awesome and I love her."

Then when we were outside she was over by our neighbors van and I looked down too pull her away from it and I was just all ""HEY! Is that money?!"" 
Pretty fricken sweet huh?!!!
Now I have coffee money for like 3 or 4 days...depending on whether I buy a cookie one day or not! hahaha! I loves me my daily coffee! ; )
YAY!
THANKS CATIE! for letting us take care of Frida while you're away! : D
Tomorrow mom and I are going into San Fran to this AWESOME! fabric store to get some fabric for my Ren. costume! Then we're going to this really cool looking tattoo/body piercing place called Braindrops to look at the things they have for gauging your ears. I want to do it so badly, but I don't even know if I could get my ears pierced.....REGULAR STYLE! Mom wants to gauge her ears. She wants spirals. 
slate y'all
haha!
I just said ""y'all"""

"event","Yesterday we went to the Northern CA Renaissance Faire! It was SOOOOOOOOOO much fun! There were tons of people and like 95% of them were in costume. There were some really nasty looking people(by 'people' I mean whores), but it was fun seeing all the different costumes.
There was this little kid who was about 10-yrs-old who had a little dalmationy colored mouse with him. It was so adorable! He walked up to me and mom and was just all ""Good day madames! Don't be afraid, she won't bite. You can pet her if you want to!"" Then he put the mouse on his head and the mouse just sat there and let me pet it. It was so cute! The kid was in this really cool peasant boy costume. It's so funny because all the kids that grew up going to the faire or with parents that participate in it are called ""faire brats"". There was also lots of pirates and lots of guys in kilts.
We didn't get to the jousting and that's kinda sad, but we didn't exactly know where it was and when we realised that it was going on it was like 20 minutes into it already. The lady that played Queen Elizabeth wasn't that great but it was still cool. 
On a super duper awesome note!
I GOT A BODICE!!!!
Mom got it for me for my birthday! YAY! It's sooo pretty! It's suede! It was one of the nicest ones there and it was the cheapest one too! Cheapest as in price; )
They had corsets....real corsets! for only $73!
They were sooooo pretty! I almost bought one but I didn't have enough, and plus the one I wanted was too big. There was some really nice clothing there, but there was also some really crappy-polyester-halloween-costume clothes too. It was so much fun!
I hope we get to go next year! : )"

I make really weird sounds when I try to smell something and when I'm in public I don't want to breath because I don't want to get anyone sick. So then I try not to breath so much but then I feel even sicker and as if I will pass out. Yeah, I know, I'm an air head for trying not to breath so much. But whatever. 
On a...nother note...
I made the mistake of Googling Camel Spiders and severly grossed myself out. So I felt even sicker then I already did. hmmm...stupid...
I'm supposed to go to class with mother tonight but I don't think I'll make it through the evening if I do.
So I guess I should probably tell her. DAMN! She's already teaching though! SON OF A BITCH!!!!

It's so clean and they don't use a gun. So yep, I'm going to get my ears pierced and then gauge them. I'm not sure if I can gauge them today or if I have to wait until the regular piercing heals. I'll just have to wait and see. Super excited and kinda scared! : ) : |"

We leave in 15 days for WA! I'm so excited! I thought we wouldn't be able to make it up there this summer, but Maddie and Heather have just gone and decided to move in together so YAY! yay for everything! I woke up at like 6 30 this morning and Maddie and I went and sat at Starbucks and read. I had my first white mocha in like 2 months. It's crazy. I couldn't even finish it. Of course that's probably because I got a grande. I used to be able to finish a grande but that was a while ago. Real interesting huh? We're renting a mini van and we're going to tie stuff on top and....on the side....gypsy style....according to mom and maddie....? Straaange...

Maddie just made the best hummus in the world! She made it with fresh, hand shelled(by me and herself)garbanzo beans from the farmers market! I finally bought UNDERWORLD!!! Just the first one though. I want the second one soooo badly! But I just didn't have enough to buy both of them today. One's good enough for now though. Scott Speedman is still in this one so that makes it all better! Yeah well I don't have anything else to say and I have to take Frida the furry sauage dog out before we go to bed.

So you can see that my weekend was busy and exciting. I did have thanksgiving dinner with part of my family. We ate food and more food and things like that. It was also my birthday on Wednesday so I didn't go to school. A couple of my friends came over and we watched TV, ate cuopcakes and opened presents. We had loads of fun. I'm having another birthday thing....... i'm pretty sure atleast."

"event","Hey,
I'm back from Nevada. It was awesome. It was atleast 95 degrees outside, but most of the time it was like 98 or 99. I had sooo much fun. We went to this water park called Wild Island, it's just like Wild Waves in Seattle but better. There were a bunch of hot guys there and there was this one lifegaurd that looked like Shia Labuaf. He was hot. We went to Lake Tahoe. We went to this thing that was set up by Extreme Limit Ministry, there were rock bands, skate boarding. There was a skate contest, there were some proskaters that did a demo and that judged the contest. One was named Elijah something and the other proskater was named Lucas something. I can only remember two of the bands names, they were ZEROTHEORY and Strategery. ZEROTHEORY are from  Reno NV and Strategery are from Fernley NV. Ferneley is this REALLY small town with nothing in it. We did a butt load of other stuff, but me sis is talling me that she is going to kick me in the shin if I don't finish. So I'm gonna go. BAH!"

"event","I hate it when friends act totally different around people that are a few years older or people that smoke and drink. those particular people will be talking about drinking or smokeing or whatever they do and my friends will be all ""YEAH! I wanna do that too!!"" ALL of my friends do that. It BUGS THE CRAP OUT OF ME!! Then when my friends aren't around people that do those things or atleast don't talk about smoking, drinking or doing drugs, they'll be totally different. I~~HATE~~IT!!

~ The other day I was in Olympia and I was walking around with my sister and one of my friends when we saw this guy that kind of looked like a hobo,but I'm not sure if he was. I'm pretty sure he was though. well anyways... he had a stick with a piece of string tied to it and a pen tied to the string. He told us he was fishing for integrity or something like that, and that he was also going to rewrite the book of the dead, but this time he was going to write a good book. Morgan couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't even look up because it was so funny."

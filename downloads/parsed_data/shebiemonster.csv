"event","My <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/_velvet_/"">roomate</a> put up some post or something, so I'm not about to be outdone!

Things have been pretty good lately. Still curling up with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/kitsune_13/"">Mom</a> and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/langsuir/"">Dad</a> before they go to sleep, still knocking the occasional thing over, still hiding their stuff. I can't get fur all over them anymore, but, cest la vie. You take what you can get. I'm still kickin' around and if Velvet thinks she can take over my territory, she's got another thing comin'! The top of the scratching post will ALWAYS be mine! Bwahahaha! That way I can still keep an eye on the place.
I think I'm finally getting used to this corporeal thing. I can go anywhere and I don't even need a harness to go outside anymore. I still miss the furrberts and wuzzles, but I think I'm gonna be ok.

Much Luv,
Shebie"

"event","It's dark in our house..Mom & Dad have to keep the windows to outside closed during the daytime, and the blinds down because the sun shines in from 3 sides. There's a cool breeze machine that is noisy, in our house but it isn't getting any cooler.

My roommate <lj user=""_velvet_""> is usually really noisy, but all she's doing now is trying to escape the heat, and lays on the couch like some kind of film star. I don't really get along with her much, but I understand how horrible this feels. I'm too hot all the time with my thick plushy fur coat. 
Mom said something about ""feeling sorry for us, and maybe she should shave us"". I think I'll have to throw up in her shoes for that comment, but it would be much cooler."

"event","Mom just dropped an entire container of yoghurt on the floor, I guess it was an accident because of the growly noises she made, but <lj user=""_velvet_""> and I helped clean it up for her.

I don't think she's feeling very well..she sleeps most of the day, blows her nose and sneezes a lot, and doesn't want me to sit on her lap, saying she's too hot.  How can she be too hot? She hasn't got any fur?

<lj user=""_velvet_""> is running around the living room making weird bagpipe noises, trying to cheer Mom up I think.

I think I need to have a quick wash, and then go lay in the sun."

"event","Mom and Dad brought a tree into our house last week and they did the strange thing they do every year..they put little toys all over it, and lights too. Then they put the round balls and the paper birds on the bottom that we can play with. They don't seem to care about those ones, but if we try to climb the tree to get the shiny toys and balls up top, they yell at us. It's not like I'm stuck in the tree or anything!! And they put water under the tree..I don't understand why the tree 
doesn't share the water dish, like I do with <lj user=""_velvet_"">. 
Mom and Dad do some funny things sometimes.  Humans are weird. 

And Mom and Dad keep bringing home lots of krinky bags with stuff in them. The day before yesterday they came home, fed <lj user=""_velvet_""> and I, gave us our nasty tasting pills, 
had their dinner, and then went out again.  When they came home, they had lots of bags full of good smelling things..bacon, cheese, and yogurt, and even lots of green stuff that I'll eat if it's all dried out (but it's not grass...Mom calls them Un-yons, whatever that means) and fruit (which doesn't smell so nice to me).
I tried to get into one of the bags that smelled like salmon, but Mom picked me up and gave me a ride on her shoulder to go sit on the couch.  I could smell treats in there..those good ones that come in the shaking bag that we get when we're pretending to be good, or when we take those nasty pills without...what does Mom call it? ...""fussing?"". Anyways, they're my favorite! 
And I could smell them, but they wouldn't let me find them in the bag.  Why?? They're for us, right?

During this cold time outside, they spend a lot of time doing whatever they do when they should be letting me warm their laps for them, and they always seem busy. 
They come in from outside, and they're all cold. And smell like smoke and lots of other people, always, dragging home those krinkly bags full of stuff. What is it all for?
They seem to not be home as much, don't nap enough, and don't want to get out of their nest in the morning. I don't blame them, it's cold outside, but it's nice and warm in here.

I don't know why they do this, but every year, Mom & Dad have all these strange smelling people in shiny clothes come over, and they drink this horrible smelling dark water that they keep warm on the dinner making counter with the knobby things. They let us patrol the house and smell everyone until too many people start coming in, and then they make us go under their nest into a kind of prison for the evening, until everyone goes home.
Our house gets full of people and noise, and smoke, and they all drink that weird smelling dark warm water and get silly...maybe it's dark catnip juice?
There's lots of krinkly paper and ribbons all over the place, but we can't play with them until everyone leaves.  But by then, Mom and Dad are tired and don't want to play, and don't want us to play either because the krinky paper noises keep them awake. But something special must be going on because it's warm, and there's always new treats for us, and new collars and toys the next day.

But it's not our birthdays yet....

They give us both that tasty bird meat I think they call Turkey..mmm...and then they fall asleep on the couch.

This time of year isn't too bad I guess."

"event","They are going out again...do they never stay home? <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/kitsune_13/"">Mom</a> and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/langsuir/"">Dad</a> are going to the place they only go to once a month. Mom's wearing her shiny stuff that I can't cover in fur, so I have to make sure I lay on her coat before she goes. I'll be really nice and warm it up for her, because it's really cold outside...much colder than the floors when the heat is too low.
I joined LJ and beat <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/_velvet_/"">the ever sleeping roommate of mine</a> her by five minutes. She never really complains tho about me going first for anything, whether it's first at our meal dish, first for a treat, or first for ""pets"" when Mom & Dad come home. I wonder if she's a zombie? All she does is sleep. 
Doesn't she want to have skritchies or paper ball toss games with them? They may be far too tall, but they're useful..they can open dinner, turn on the taps for drinks, and not have to carry stuff in their mouth.
Plussssssssssss, they can open the top of the fridge..the cold cold part where the crack treats are...they call it catnip tho', and it's my favorite.:>3 And even tho they always are yelling at me to get out of the big round white drink thing I can sit in in the litterbox room, I'll still be nice to them.

Oops, they're getting ready to go..gotta go warm up that coat of hers. She doesn't have enough fur to keep warm, and her shiny stuff doesn't cover very much."

"event","Hey everybody! Saw Louise last night waiting for her mum around 6.15pm. In normal clothes so must have done geog trip into Hull. She jus completely blanked me wich wasnt very nice but i deserve it and i was quite glad cos i did the same back. Stayed for senior drama comp (Well, one play dosent really make a comp but they won by default). Quite good, funny bits but too repetetive. More teachers in audience than actual parents and pupils. Tinnion laughing so loud i tink the eskimos in the arctic heard him. Playing rugby after school-me,julie,hughes,danny,doug,bates,boothy. Boothy laid on hughes bad shoulder, hughes went pyscho and properly laid into boothy. Boothy laid on floor nearly paralysed. Boothy said next time he would have hughs but hughes jus laughed and walked away. Bye!"

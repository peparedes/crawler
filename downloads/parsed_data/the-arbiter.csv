"event","I'm glad they didn't assassinate Hitler. If they had there would have been about 50 things going worse for the allied cause. You see, Hitler was a stubborn man and he did not like to change tactics or listen to his top Generals. If he had [been assassinated] the Germans would have had x2 of their airforce, instead of 2 frontlines about 20-50 smaller easily defendable frontlines, more machine-gun nests, Omaha and Utah beach would have been defended better, etc...

Kind of interesting to see that the man I loved to be dead so much for so long is the man we all needed to be alive throughout the war. Even till his very last moments alive. Here's what they were like:

Hitler spent his last moments alive with his new wife Ava, his German Shephard and a small pistol. The sound of hundreds of Russian forces could be heard not a mile away. And in this allied grace, Russians closing in on their despicable enemy, through the gunfire, tankfire and explosives, one single shot rang out above them all."

""We're fortunate in being Americans. At least we don't step on the underdog. I wonder if that's because there are no 'Americans'--only a stew of immigrants--or if it's because the earth from which we exist has been so kind to us and our forefathers; or if it's because the 'American' is the offspring of the logical European who hated appression and loved freedom beyond life? Those great mountains and the tall timber; the cool deep lakes and broad rivers; the green valleys and white farmhouses; the air, the sea and wind; the plains and great cities; the smell of living--all must be the cause of it. And yet, with all that, we can't get away from the rest. For every one of our millions who has that treasure in his hand there's another million crying for that victory of life. And for each of us who wants to live in happiness and give happiness, there's another different sort of person wanting to take it away... Those people always manage to have their say, and Mars is always close at hand. We know how to win wars. We must learn now to win peace... If I ever have a son, I don't want him to go through this again, but I want him powerful enough that no one will be fool enough to touch him. He and America should be strong as hell and kind as Christ."" Letter from Lieutenant Thomas Meehan(101st Airborne Company Commander) to his wife, WWII."

The only good part of war is the end.

The point of war is not to die for your country, but to make the other bastard die for his.

If only he can shun warfare.

A silly man lies awake all night,
Thinking of many things.
When the morning comes he is worn with care,
And his troubles are just as it was.

A paltry man and poor of mind
Is he who mocks all things.

Brave men can live well anywhere.
A coward dreads all things.

Man is the joy of man.

No man has nothing but misery, let him be never so sick.
To this one his sons are a joy, and to that
His kin, to another his wealth.
And to yet another the good he has done.

None so good that he has no faults,
None so wicked that he is worth naught.

Moderately wise each one should be,
Not overwise, for a man's heart
Is seldom glad.

Cattle die and kindred die. We also die.
But I know one thing that never dies,
Judgement on each one dead.

The mind knows only
What lies near the heart.

A greater than all.
But I dare not ever to speak his name.
And there are few who can see beyond
The moment when Odin falls."

I took a ghost tour with some crazy guy wearing a jedi robe. I think I'll tell the story he told us about a hurrican.

About 50-100 years ago a Hurricane hit St. Augustine. Now back then this was the only way to unvcover history in the ocean, so a bunch of men rowed out to an island near St. Augustine to see if any shipwrecks washed up or bodies or anything. They found none of these things, but they did find something....something that didnt disappoint them.

A grey body with no eyes and long arms. When stretched out the arms spanned like 40 feet. It was examined by a scientist and determined to be a new species of jelly fish. From the pitcures taken and tissue samples, our modern day scientisit have determined that it was a new species of jelly fish, but in the past 50 years only 5 have washed up all after hurricanes.

In ancient greek mythology there is a monster which lives under the sea. It only comes out during hurricanes to feed...fact or ficition? I saw the picture for myself...the thing is creepy looking."

wtf is wrong with me? Shit like that seriously never makes me wanna drive again. There were a bunch of cars stopped across the intersection from me at a red light and I remember thinking ""why are they all pointing at me?"".

There were clumps of its flesh embedded in the asphalt and a random leg laying on the white dividing lines making them red. A few feet behind those was the actual body. The hindquaters were completely missing and intenstines were spilling out where it's hind legs should have been. Dark purple. The eyes were rolled back and halfway closed, and it's tongue was hanging completely out of its mouth and glistening in lovely afternoon sun. Of course, traffic was moving painfully slow which enabled me to see every.last.detail as my car rolled by. 

Its amazing how the details of every beautiful thing I've ever seen fail me right now and all I can see when I close my eyes is that lifeless bloody thing. 

It was wearing a brown leather collar."

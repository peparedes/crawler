First I want to give an update on whats happening in my crappy life currently. I did not get the pixar internship this summer, so I will be traveling around as usual

I rented out my room to a fantastic girl named Jessi, and we've all been hitting the town this week for a little farewell chicago / hello chicago festivities. Last night we went to Kerryman bar in the gold coast, ducking in the bathroom a few times to quench our thirst from a flask filled with vodka and crystal light, and dancing a little carelessly in the midst of annoying, middle aged gents. We got out of there and walked down the street with the hilarious intention of going to Excalibur, only to be stopped by more middled aged men hanging outside a classy looking piano bar. Silly enough, we decided to check it out and see if the pianist was still playing. After wandering around and being directed to different rooms in the hope of finding the musician (but entering a few rooms disturbingly filled with groups of older men listening to Shakira and drinking martinis) we finally found him packing up. High tailing it out of there after we realized there were maybe 3 other women in the entire place (who were at least twice our age) we were once more harassed by the men out front who promptly made fun of us for intending to go to Excalibur. They predicted we would be out of there in a matter of minutes and head over to the Red Head, like all the other predictable tourists in the area. Still, we jut wanted to get the heck out of there company, so we did just that: Excalibur (though we got in for free) wasn't very fun, but totally not as bad as I thought it would be. We looked around for a bit, then headed out. On the front steps the two other girls chatted with the manager and somehow got a card for free salsa dancing lessons while I was harassed by a super old guy with a creep mile who grabbed my arm and proceeded to pull me back in the club. I barely escaped. 

The Red Head was awesome. We sat right in front of the pianist, and dodged the girl who came around to take drink orders (none of us wanted to spend any money) After telling her several times we were still thinking about it, finally we decided to order one drink to share, when she said there was a 1 drink per person minimum! So we were about to get up and go, when this middle aged, beer bellied man grabbed my hand and started dancing with me, telling me about his wife and kids and how he was visiting from Texas. At the time, it honestly didn't seem creepy. On the train home a drunk guy started talking to us, and we somehow convinced him we were at the same how as him. And we saw a mallard duck sitting on a roof. Fabulous."

I am finally going to go into the animation room tonight and catch up hardcore. I should have my demo reel finished, and sound to my projects so I don't fail my class, and so I can also apply for this Pixar internship in california. I really would like to go there this summer. Chicago, you are great, but I need a break....

"event","I have spent the past couple of years suspended in the cold realm of the unknown. Was I a Rabbit or a Tiger? Now, upon first glance, you might automatically assume I was in fact a Human, but because my insatiably thirst for constant entertainment and stimulus, I have decided to compose a sort of rant expressing the similaritie and differences of each Zodiac sign as well as their relation to my own personality. (....Wikipiedia most likely being my main source.)


 Let's begin with the animal I identified with the most since childhood, and was raised believing that it was my Zodiac sign. Every Chinese Food Establishment I went to had the same misconstruing information on their place mats. Underneath the stylized icon of each animal were 2 to 3 year dates. My mom and dad are the horse; independent and energetic while overflowing with ideas. My older sister is the Ox; Fair, dependable and modest. Younger sister is the Snake: Subtle, mysterious and charming. This girl is subtle for sure. Hardly ever leaves her room. Then, it was my turn. The Rabbit. 1987. Classy, modest, and creative. It also says that they are very conservative. Now, some of these things are me to the T, but it also says that rabbits abhor change, and I can't stand living in the same place for a prolonged amount of time. 
 But I accepted it. It wasn't too different from my personality. I was reading a book one day (like ya do) and it said that the dates of a Tiger are February 7th, 1986 to January 28th, 1987. Shocked and dismayed, since my birthday fell exactly on the 28th of January, I was beside myself, having been living a lie since childhood! I hurridly looked up the horoscope of a Tiger. Apparently, I was actually a born leader, with a positive attitude and a love for challenges. Also, I am a loner...but I am cool with that. Hmm. 


I am off to change my liiifeeee wooo......also, i got really bored with writing this entry halfway through.....damn my job is boring. Some guy just came up to me and asked how much a smoothie was, and upon hearing my answer, swore at me and mumbled something about getting a whole meal at McDonalds. Good for him. Whoaaaaaaaaaa...........letter are funny looking."

I was freaking out because there was no hand rail or gaurd, and I almost feel between the levels and down to the city thousands of feet below. Then I complained to one of the staff members who seemed to not care whatsoever. So i left to go back to chicago. Its dark and i am waiting for the train. There are a bunch of people around that I know, and it feels like we all just got out of a concert and are hanging out in a very industrial area. Then, I see a huge star in the sky and stare at it for a while. It gets bigger and bigger and soon i realize its actually a meteor falling to the earth. I watch it and point it out to everyone, but no one cares. When it hits, there is a huge explosion miles and miles away which everyone freaks out about and thinks it's terrorists or something. I try to tell them it was a meteor but they think i am crazy. A huge cloud of dust hits us and I dont breath for a really long time. 

When I woke up it was 3.30 am. I had gone to bed at 7.30 pm last night with the hopes that I would wake up around the time I did and do some work. I however immediately fell back asleep and didn't wake up until 8.30, thus getting 13 hours of sleep."

I was very excited about it, and suddenely realized that my studio was direclty in front of a former students that was in my class last year who I admired a great deal. I was suddenely very self conscious and went outside and it was filled with vendors and booths and tons of people and I had to find these children with magical powers who were lost in the crowd. It was too choatic so I ran away and decided to go to Dubai and visit my mom but the transportation I took was a mix between a plane and a train. I got off shy of the airport, by a place called Spinny's (a common supermarket in dubai) and everything was not built yet. There was sand everywhere still, as if the place was deserted and the sand blew over everything. They had built a rollar coaster on the shore line, and it was extremely intrusive of the landscape. I was upset at it, but then road it and it was fun so I accepted it.

So we traveled down the shoreline and suddenely we were in a jungle. Our new house was there and it was huge and our neighbors were franz ferdinand. I was really excited (obviously) to be their neighbors, but apparently there were like 50 fangirls who lived near by who would come by and bother them a lot while they were practicing, so i was trying to be cool about it but it just didn't work....hmm."

It began with me on the bus, and I didn't know where to get off. The bus driver told me to get off at the next stop, so i did, but it was the wrong stop so i waited for another bus. I could see in the distance that a storm was coming in. The bus stop shelter was coming apart and a group of people came by to fix it. They told me that a huge storm was coming and they needed to secure everything so it doesn't blow away. I tried to help, but ended up making things worse. One of the men in the group just laughed and said something like ""Oh trina, you are so cute"" and fixed my mistake, but I had no idea who he was. The storm was getting stronger and the group all dissipated but the one man got on a helicopter and asked me if i wanted to come with him. I leaned into the helicopter and said maybe but before i could make a choice, it lifted off without me knowing until we were very high up and there were clouds below my feet. I screamed and he pulled me in and we both laughed, mine being uneasy. I turned to look outside and the storm was rolling in, but the clouds had metallic circuitry and alien like technology fading in and out within them. Before I could determine what this meant, the man put his hand to my face and turned it towards him. I asked what he was doing, and he said he just found me attractive and wanted to look at my face. I became really uncomfortable and regretted getting in the helicopter. He pinched my elbow until it bleed, but I didn't want to confront him about it, so I didn't say anything. We flew to a foreign land and I suppose we got married, or lived together. Our house was very elaborate but small and dark. He hung a contemporary painting of the crucifixion above the fireplace. One of his friends said he didn't like it, and I didn't like it either, but the man I lived with got annoyed. I began to like his friend. I didn't say anything, but went out to buy a different painting to put near it. When i got back, the mantle and surrounding area was covered with religious art and symbols. I hung the painting I bought next to the crusifixion and the man came in. He said something like ""that friend of mine is an idiot, he doesn't know what he's talking about and this will show him."" I asked him if he liked the painting i bought and he didn't, but said I could leave it there if i liked it. I was unsure if he meant that or not. I left again and everything was very dark and had no color. I thought about his friend and wondered why my husband-thing didn't ask me why i was acting unhappy. I went into a shop that looked like my house that had lots of trinkets for sale and i was amazed at how cheap everything was. I bought a ring and a plastic bracelet that was uncomfortable and went back home. The mantel with all the religious icons was still there. Everything was extremely dark and even so I wore sunglasses. I stared at the fireplace, then turned to leave the house but woke up before I stepped out the door...."

The whole time, these two kids, about maybe 15 or 16 years of age, were making out on the beach. This wouldn't have been too disturbing, except they were drunk off their asses. 3pm on a sunday afternoon, two underage annoying brats trying to hide a bottle of jack under their beach towel being obnoxious in super rich suburbia. Basically the definition of brighton. Siigh. 

Anyway, hung out at a different beach today and saw basically the same thing, only more of it. It was fun though. Later we saw Knocked Up. Funny and disturbing. Even later, we hung out at the park, which closed at 10 pm. We were there until 10.30 pm, and just when we were walking to our car, a cop pulled up and yelled at us.

"event","I made it to Oshkosh. I bought my train ticket thinking that it was also my bus ticket, but I discovered while I was in Milwaukee that it was indeed...not. Before this realization, I had spent most of the cash on lunch and had not the 18 dollars to pay for the bus ride which was in 3 hours. My bank account was overdrawn but 10 dollars and would not let me take any money out. My mom wouldn't pick up her phone (typical) my sister had just gotten back from the casino (typical) and my dad was over seas (very typical). So I was stranded. And I must say it was hilarious fun indeed. It started as a brilliantly sunny day, and I walked the 7 blocks to the Wicked Hop pub to have lunch, because I love that place. Spent my money, bought coffee and walked back to the station. Went to the guy to ask him where the bus was going to stop and he told me I had to buy a ticket from the driver. ""Ah-huh-wha?"" I ran to the post office next door to try and get money from the ATM. I spilled coffee all over my white shirt (remember the white shirt thing as it will help you to understand a later delemma of mine). The machine basically laughed at me. After calling everyone in my family, and panicking a tiny bit, I look out side and Milwaukee was thus transported under Niagara. I ran next door to the train station and arrive as if I had fallen into the lake. I had to wear my backpack in front. So yea at this point I was coming to terms with the fact that I was basically screwed. 

An old grandma slowly walked up to me as I stood there pondering my situation. She said she had overheard my conversation with my dad, and offered to give me money for the bus. The sunshine literally came out at that moment. She paid for my ticket and refused to accept any sort of payback. Magic! 

So I got to the hotel, settled down and enjoyed the most stress free night ever! yaaay! everything with the sublet went well, but stressful. I was at the in-process training classes all week, skillfully avoiding talking about the fact that I was going to be working for my father, as I was going to class with about 30 other people all for different jobs who had to go through interviews and the like to get the job. I got a tour of the oshkosk truck plants and almost got killed by 3 forklifts because I am a ding. Tomorrow I get on a flight to Detroit and spend the weekend in brighton mi, then on the 12th I go to italy until the 20th. Then I start work in Dubai. 


wish me lots of luck and send me flowers."

Today equaled the realization that I am no longer friends with my friends here in my home town. Sure, they call me, we hang out, I listen to them chatter on about inside jokes, old high school occurrences and every once in a while add my voice to the conversation only to be discarded over and over again. Le siiiigh. Plus, they are not interesting to me anymore. Why wont it thunderstorm already? 


Look out chicago, here I come....again! See you in a few days FOR a few days. I hate the radio. I love the train and driving but I hate cars. Why am I going to Milwaukee? Why does my mom keep the pilot light on in our fake little fireplace? We will all explode!"

Then I will go to Amsterdam on August 7th and see what my buddies Mariel and Jacob are up to. I should be back in Chicago on August 15th then to start the new school year. That is all."

I hate walking the halls. Particularly that one long white, locker lined path to Sunny's.

You will notice eachother from each end, and for some reason the entire walk is awkward. Please oh please let them turn down the photography hall. If they dont, what if you sort of know this person? Is it a cute boy? Should you make eye contact? Is there paint or clay on my face? Do i walk all funny? Oh em gee, lookit that something interesting on the floor, better look at it, oh they passed?

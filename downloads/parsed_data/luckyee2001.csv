not just the wishing that people weren't and school and such.  i just had life figured out then, everything was happy and swell.  everyday now i feel like something's missing.  and i know that it's my fault.  and i know that i can't change it.  and that makes me really annoyed with myself for messing up my balance.  cause now i'm alll out of whack, and there's no quick and easy fix."

"event","I don't know what to do.  I hate to see you pained like this, but I can't think of any other options.  I can't keep leading you on like I used to.  It's weak of me and you deserve someone who will love you back just as much as you loved me.  You know that right?  Honestly, I don't know what happened to really end it all, but I feel like at this point, it's too late.  I'm almost accustomed to life without you.  I wish we could still be best friends like we used to, but I just see that as me leading you on again.  And I want you to get over me because I do not want to look at your face and just feel terribly guilty anymore.  No shit, it's my fault.  But- what am I to do about it?  I can't do anything.  So I get mad, or I avoid you. I lie to you ""all the time"" because I feel like I don't want to lie to you if I do hangout with someone who you wouldn't like.  Would you rather me flat out tell you that I went to sushi with another guy?  If yes, then I will. In the beginning I had serious doubts about the end.  But you're not like how you used to be- you're mopey and sad all the time, so I don't really have those anymore.  I know why you are, but I can't get around it.  You are/were my best friend and I enjoyed what we had while we had it.  I just don't see anything happening again.  And I don't think we should hang out because it makes you dwell in the past.  And we aren't in the past anymore.  I'm all right with being #4."

"event","So I got on to livejournal today for one of the first times in about a year.  I was just checking out mine, when I came across one of my closest friends.  It made me cry.  I can't even imagaine how cute and happy we were in the beginning of our relationship.  Now everything just seems so monotonus and repeated that nothing is exciting, and we always fight.  Especially this last month.  We've been going through some rough/tough stuff and I have no idea how to control or change that.  I almost broke up with him yesterday and almost today, again.  Seeing his lj and how ecstatic he was about everything we did together, made a flood of memories come back.  Back from when the times were happy and cheerful, and relatively easier going.  Now it seems to be so hardcore.  And I don't like it this way.  I didn't realize the excitement that happens even in the 1st year goes away after time.  I see my other friends who start relationships and are bouncing-off-the-walls-happy, but did not really comprehend that it was any different than my relationship now, until I read his lj.  I wanna go back in time like none other."

This is prolly only the best song ever (or at least right now)...

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppie girls never looked at me
Why should they?
I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket
Beverly Hills

That's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Rolling like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between 

I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
'cause I'm the next big thing
Beverly Hills
That's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills

Rolling like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills
The truth is I don't stand a chance
It's something that you're born into
And I just don't belong
No I don't
I'm just a no-class beat down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play
Beverly Hills

That's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills

Rolling like a celebrity

"event","Bah.  Not in the best of moods.  Actually, in a fucking terrible mood right now.  It was Dave and my 1 year yesterday, and the day (after about 4 pm) was awesome.  He's the most amazing person there is.  And he got me the prettiest roses ever, which makes me insanely happy b/c I love roses.  Gah, but prior to that, we got into a depressing moment/period b/c I was being stupid and getting all upset regarding myself, and I didn't want to tell him because I didn't want for him to be like ""oh, don't feel like that..""  There's just some times when you hate that.  So, I didn't tell him, but he asked me if it regarded him, and our relationship and I said yes, and so when I wouldn't tell him what it was about, he figured it probably had to do with breaking up.  So he was all depressed, and I was all depressed.  Basically, I feel like a bad gf because I'm always the one making mistakes, and I'm always the one who is asking things of him, and I'm always the one having the doubts.  And he's always there for me, and always extremely patient with me, and extremely calm, and willing to listen.  That's more than I can say.  And I am afraid that there IS someone better for him than me, because I don't want there to be because he's the best thing that's ever happened to me.  So bleh... That's no fun.  Not to mention the other shit that I have plauging my head these days.

There've been better days, than today, this Easter.  Much better. (Like yesterday evening)"

With major extremities and all.  Found out some interesting information.  Watched ""Down with Love""= really cute.  Getting my wisdom teeth taken out in the beginning of mid-winter break.  That sux.  Gonna die my hair again too.  Maybe bright, maybe subtle, not sure yet.  And I'm gonna get my tongue pierced when my birthday rolls around.  I'm psyched.

Right now I'm in one of those really relaxed moods.  Today I realized even MORE that I'm crazy in love with Dave today.  It's not a questionable thing.  There's such a powerful connection there.  He's the best thing that's ever happened to me.  And as weird as it may sound, he's whats saved me too in some ways.  :-d

I hate how I'm a suckup 
I hate how I am a bitch to some (probably most) of my friends  
I hate how I'm not some perfect fucking chick
I hate how I can't be someone with no cares in life.  
I hate how just when you think everything's made, you let life roll on, and suddenly
WHAM!
Everything hits you like a brick and you realize 'fuck, i don't want this anymore.'"

It's a natural plant that grows in the dirt. 
Do you know what's not natural?
80 year old dudes with hard-ons. That's not natural.
But we got pills for that.
We're dedicating all our medical resources to keeping the old guys erect,
but we're putting people in jail for something that grows in the dirt?

You know we have more prescription drugs now.
Every commercial that comes on TV is a prescription drug ad.
I can't watch TV for four minutes without thinking I have five serious diseases.
Like: ""Do you ever wake up tired in the morning?""
Oh my god I have this, write this down. Whatever it is, I have it. 
Half the time I don't even know what the commercial is:
people running in fields or flying kites or swimming in the ocean.
I'm like that is the greatest disease ever. How do you get that?
That disease comes with a hot chick and a puppy. 

The schools now: It is all about self-esteem in the schools now.
Build the kids' self-esteem, make them feel good about themselves.
If everybody grows up with high self-esteem, who is going to dance in our strip clubs?
What's going to happen to our porno industry?
These women don't just grown on trees. 
It takes lots of drunk dads missing dance recitals before you decide to blow a goat on the internet for fifty bucks.
And if that disappears, where does that leave me on a Friday night with my new high speed connection?

Masterminds are another word that comes up all the time.
You keep hearing about these terrorists masterminds that get killed in the middle east. 
Terrorists masterminds.
Mastermind is sort of a lofty way to describe what these guys do, don't you think?
They're not masterminds.
""OK, you take bomb, right? And you put in your backpack. And you get on bus and you blow yourself up. Alright?""
""Why do I have to blow myself up? Why can't I just:""
""Who's the fucking mastermind here? Me or you?""

Americans, let's face it: We've been a spoiled country for a long time. 
Do you know what the number one health risk in America is? 
Obesity. They say we're in the middle of an obesity epidemic.
An epidemic like it is polio. Like we'll be telling our grand kids about it one day.
The Great Obesity Epidemic of 2004.
""How'd you get through it grandpa?""
""Oh, it was horrible Johnny, there was cheesecake and pork chops everywhere.""

Nobody knows why were getting fatter? Look at our lifestyle.
I'll sit at a drive thru. 
I'll sit there behind fifteen other cars instead of getting up to make the eight foot walk to the totally empty counter.
Everything is mega meal, super sized. Want biggie fries, super sized, want to go large. 
You want to have thirty burgers for a nickel you fat mother fucker. There's room in the back. Take it!
Want a 55 gallon drum of Coke with that? It's only three more cents.

Sometimes you have to suffer a little bit in your youth to motivate yourself to succeed in later life.
Do you think if Bill Gates got laid in high school, do you think there'd be a Microsoft?
Of course not.
You got to spend a long time in your own locker with your underwear shoved up your ass before you start to think,
""You'll see. I'm going to take of the world of computers! I'll show them.""

We're in one of the richest countries in the world,
but the minimum wage is lower than it was thirty five years ago.
There are homeless people everywhere.
This homeless guy asked me for money the other day.
I was about to give it to him and then I thought he was going to use it on drugs or alcohol.
And then I thought, that's what I'm going to use it on.
Why am I judging this poor bastard.
People love to judge homeless guys. Like if you give them money they're just going to waste it.
Well, he lives in a box, what do you want him to do? Save it up and buy a wall unit?
Take a little run to the store for a throw rug and a CD rack? He's homeless.
I walked behind this guy the other day. 
A homeless guy asked him for money.
He looks right at the homeless guy and says why don't you go get a job you bum.
People always say that to homeless guys like it is so easy.
This homeless guy was wearing his underwear outside his pants.
Outside his pants. I'm guessing his resume isn't all up to date.
I'm predicting some problems during the interview process.
I'm pretty sure even McDonalds has a ""underwear goes inside the pants"" policy.
Not that they enforce it really strictly, but technically I'm sure it is on the books.

"event","Well, this year has been an interesting year so far.  I got drunk on New Year's Eve with my friend, and then I went over to Dave's house to chill with some of our friends.  And Dave got upset with me because I told him previously, that I would tell him if I was going to drink, and I had told him that I would let him come too.  Well, I didn't do either of those.  I honestly didn't remember that he had wanted to be there.  And I didn't think the other thing through.  I didn't tell him what we were gonna do when he asked me, and so he was disappointed, and I was officially an ass.  And to make matters worse, I got fed up with his attitude (disappointed and mellow) and so my friend and I waited till about 5 minutes after the ball fell and New Years was officially here, and then we left.  We left to try and go get some more alcohol.  We ended up not finding any, but the intent was still there.  And I told Dave that we were leaving and pretty much left crazy fast, and so he kept calling my friend's cell to see what the hell was up, and we didn't pick up.  But then I called him after I got home that night, and we worked things out. Or at least so I thought.  Then, the next couple of days, he was sad again, and I hated to see him sad, and I couldn't do a damn thing about it.  And he didn't want me to feel bad for what had happened, so I REALLY couldn't do anything.  Finally this Tuesday, I was in a crazy mood, and I broke down and sobbed, cuzz I REALLY just didn't want to see him hurt anymore, and I had slowly felt things going downhill for the past month, maybe a lil more.  So, I broke up with him, mostly because I didn't want to hold the potential to hurt him anymore.  God, I was in such a fucked up mood.  I thought of just crazed possibilites.  And the first thought when I got off the phone with him, was what the hell have i just done?  And I didn't know... 

I'm someone who's ALWAYS been able to fall asleep easy, and still physically function when terrible things occur (for example, when my cousin died).  I couldn't fall asleep for 2 hours and I couldn't eat.  

That brings me to Wednesday.  After 1st period, I walked up to Dave (he had the saddest face I had ever seen on anyone) and I told him that I was sorry, and that it just isn't right being without him.  And we got back together.  Crazy huh?

Out of all of that, I have learned that I am really going to tell Dave when I drink, and not make crazy impulsive decisions when I'm in a horrible mood (like breaking-up with him)."

"event","<P>I just spent over an hour writing in my written journal, and I wanted to post some of it in here, cuzz I wanna get your guys' opinion on it. So comments are extra welcome here. Maybe kinda random. Recently I've not really been able to pick out specifically ugly things. Yeah, I know that sounds like a good thing, or just that I was a snob before, and it may be true for all I know. It's kind of been hard to explain though. Yesterday, one of my best friends put it in words for me though. She was talking about one of her insightful friends and their strong belief that something cannot truly be beautiful on the outside, unless they are beautiful on the inside. Basically, beauty is built from the inside out. If you're a good person, that's knowledgeable about life (not book-smart, but wise/insightful/thoughtful sort) on the inside, it's surely going to radiate to the outside. All this ""social foreplay"" (as one of my friends says), popularity, and drama is like a twister that people can SOOOOO easily get sucked into. It happens to basically everyone, or at least, they sense it. The twister looks like it would be fun, and different, and first, but in reality, if you get sucked into the twisting, spiraling tornado, you're traveling down a dangerous path. And if you can get out, do. Or at least, try your hardest to. If you do get out, you can step back and realize that you ARE the unique ones. In a good way. You are ""special"" (as your elementary teachers kept trying to reinforce in your head. Within the dangerous twister, everything is fake. There is no true beauty, not true love, no true friendships, or relationships between people. No true appreciation for life. But with all those good truths, come the painful truths. You can feel more, so if someone betrays you, or breaks your heart, they <EM>truly </EM>do and&nbsp;it&nbsp;<EM>truly</EM> does hurt.</P>

That was a lot of fun.  And it got me into this deep mood that I'm in now.  I really feel like writing a bunch right now.  Filling pages upon pages with  my thoughts and my feelings and my emotions, yet at the same time, I feel drained and emotionless.  I've been thinking about a lot of things today.  I think I'm gonna write some letters to Ray and Dana (good letters, not angry letters).  

My life, my choices, my beliefs, our relationship, my friendships with people, what I want from my life, why I feel self-concious about certain things, why people are so anti-sex at a young age.  A wide variety of things have all been topics of thought today.  

They've been neither bad nor good thoughts.  More neutral thoughts.  I'm thinking and it's not about the fact that things are not or are going as planned, but more like unfolding them.  

Don't have much more to say.  I'm taking an evening for myself.  It's crazy how that works.  A number of people I know spend the majority of their time, at their house, whereas, I tend to spend every waking moment either with someone, or on the phone with people.  I always try to keep myself preoccupied because I don't like to be alone, for usually my mind will dwell on depressing things and not be happy.  But I'm starting to get better with alone-time with myself.  Kinda weird thing eh? Not being comfortable with yourself so much to the point that you fear down time..."

I have had a decent week, and not terribly too much homework this week. *KNOCKS ON WOOD* I start piano back up again this week= YAY! I haven't taken lessons for about 6 months now, cuzz I had too busy of a summer and then I was doing 2 sports at a time.  But now, those have ended, and I am left getting back into yet another one of my passions.  XC is having their state competitions currently- as I write this.  I wanted to go, but I couldn't get a ride to Pasco, where are being held.  I managed to land a few jobs with my neighbor: running/walking with her dog and simple tasks like that.  She's gonna pay me 10 bucks an hour, so it's pretty sweet.  Not to mention, I'm also having my name put out in the ""Babysitting Co-op"" of our neighborhood saying that I'm willing to work for decent pay.  There's around 40 people in that group, who all have kids, and may need some kind of assistance.  I'm getting excited because I haven't had much of an income and have been drawing from my savings, and have depleted a lot of it.  We have a 4-day weekend next weekened, which I am psyched about.  Dave gets his liscense, and I'm gonna have a few of my close school friends over to my house too.  Lol, it's such a big deal.  WE have our last soccer game tomorrow, and I'm pretty pysched about that :-d.  I'm actually playing in it because it'll have been almost a month since I've been off it, and I'm gonna try to run next week probably about 3 times a week at first, so I don't over do it.  

SNOWBOARDING SEASON IS ALMOST HERE! EXCITING!"

"event","Everything is so blah right now.  I don't even know where to begin.  I'm so just annoyed with everything right now and yet, I don't want to be.  I keep trying myself that it's my choice to be this way, but I'm just not believing that.

I realized today, that when I'm around my friends even, I get really self-concious and self-loating because my friiends are so perfect and have so much going for them, and I don't see even a slight possible chance that I compare to that.  AT ALL. I never have been and never will be able to see that.  

Basically, the theme throughout these last weeks has been that life sux ass right now."

"event","Ugh, everything sux.  I feel really productive these days, but then I realize that I'm getting basically nothing done in comparison to everything I SHOULD be getting done.  Plus, I just haven't been feeling well.  And then, I've been being short-tempered with everyone, and bleh.  Also, I haven't been able to chill with Dave in a long time, and it's been really frustrating for me, because he's one of my closest friends, and plus my boyfriend, and I've been missing hanging out with him.  Not to mention, I've been feeling lacking in the hangout time with the rest of my friends too.  I just want not as much stuff to do or something.  I wanna be healed, so I don't have to spend 2.5 fucking hours going to go work out and such, so I can just go running for like 45 minutes, and take a shower for like 15 minutes= 1 hour, SAVING 1.5 hours of my day.  Gosh darnit.  So frustrating."

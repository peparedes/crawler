"event","you know what I don't get?! Why people bother to show up to class late. I mean not like a few minutes late but I mean class is 3 hours long and you walk in with an hour left, why bother coming? It really bugs me. I&nbsp;guess It's just because I'm the type who barely likes to come in late by a minute. However, its still stupid of you to walk in when you obviously haven't cared about the class during the last two hours. 

I am in no means the best student, in fact I tend to fake my way through everything I can. I make it seem as if I care as much as I can but sometimes I can only do so much...like right now, I'm sure the professor thinks I'm taking notes and paying attention but rather, we all know...I am not. It's because I'm smart, I type and look up at him while he talks so it looks as if I actually am coping every word he is saying. 

well lets just pray i get out early, i'm bored out of my mind."

"event","ok so i've been sick to my stomach since saturday morning and I also think I'm starting to get a sinus infection...yay for stress and tired sickness...you would think my body would get used to this considering it happens 2-3 a year and always around finals time. grr. stupid body.

anywho, so i have two tests today, one i've already taken and one i'm about to take. Which really I&nbsp;should be studying for, but you know me, I put off the important things all the time. Currently, I'm just trying not to throw up so yay me. 

After I&nbsp;take my test, I am getting food for the first time today which is odd for me because usually I eat breakfast but today there was no time. Then I&nbsp;have one last class to go to before I'm free for break..well not really a break when you have to write a 20 page paper, a ten page paper, a 6 page paper, and a 2 page paper, and a presentation in Italian. THen I&nbsp;have physical therapy for my wrists and hands and then i get to pack and get ready to head to RR dor the weekedn which completely sucks because theres only going to be one person there I&nbsp;want to see and I&nbsp;have to spend the whole time away from Kagun and I&nbsp;HATE&nbsp;THAT!!! But at least I'll get my stuff done, well hopefully. 

Anywho, that's about it. I just wanted to type some of this out so that maybe it would relieve some stress and make me not think about throwing up. 

Have a good thanksgiving!"

"event","So i only update when there are things on my mind now and I&nbsp;only really do it to let it out and to move on with life from that point. However there are some things in the updates I&nbsp;do for other people so that you all know what I've been up to or what I'll be up to.

I still read a lot of entries on here and observe the lives of people i don't really talk to and i make my comments few and far between, at least to them. Some people have changed far more than they ever should have and yet somehow manage to stay the same and that in its self may be why we dont talk anymore. Either way the people in my past are that, in my past, they are still oved for always being there once upon a time but they are not in my present or really my future. Harsh but true. 

Anyways.

Cassie and I are getting a good flow with keeping up with each other. Whether its text messages, a few mins online, or the far between phone call but what we really use is letters and I&nbsp;love that we can manage this relationship from so far away. I cannot wait until December 19th when I&nbsp;pick her up at the airport and we get to drive to RR the next day together. It's going to be awesome! I just can't wait to see her...I think that's why this semester is going even slightly well is the fact that there is an end goal...to see her. However I&nbsp;also think that the reason everything seems out of reach is because i don't have her here but its all a learning experience and I'm sure I'll get used to it. 

Other issues....I do have Carpal Tunnel...at 20! That's so odd to every one, including me, but its true. I'll know more soon because I&nbsp;have to go have an EMG done to be sure what all is happening, but I also start Physical Therapy twice a week this week which takes more time from my schooling but i need it so i'll have to do it. THis whole ordeal is really getting to me because it slows me down, it makes me dependent on others, and it keeps me from doing so many things. And I&nbsp;already have no motivation for anything. 

My dad is in China for business, which is kind of cool but weird all at one time. Makes it hard to talk to him. But I guess its only two weeks anyway.

Someone used my pumpkins to break my window in my bedroom of my apartment and other people's windows at my apartment. It sucks because now i have a hole in my window letting air in, ruining my electric bill and freezing my bedroom at night. Hopefully soon it'll be taken care of.

My Brother stil lhasn't found a job in RR/Austin. He is out of the Air Force, at least actively, he has one year of reserve until he's free but yeah. He's having a tough time with being a first time home owner and dealing with not finding a job yet. He's upset that he didn't take the path I'm on but he doesn't see how far he has actually come from where he was when he was my age. 

Kagun and I&nbsp;are doing well. Yesterday was actually the 2 year anniversary of our first kiss and pretty much marks the point that I stopped thinking about other guys :) I'm happy with him and one day in the future we will be getting married. I&nbsp;have a promise ring and I&nbsp;love him so much.

School is falling apart on me. I have nothing under control because I just dont care anymore. I haven't had a break in 3 years. and I'll be graduating in August with two BAs, one is Psychology, one in Sociology :) and then I'll be joining the workforce. I'll also be moving from&nbsp;Denton to Dallas to be closer to Kagun when he goes to Parker Chiropractic College. I'm excited for a new focus and new life.

Anywho, I was going to go more in depth on school but my wrists are getting sore so I must stop here.

Hope everyone is doing okay."

"event","ok although this is probably going to mess with my wrists and make them hirt entirely too much I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;may need to address it, if anything just for my own sake. Because right now I'm either emotional due to my period or maybe it is just built up from everything this semester. It has been a very quick and exhausting few weeks and I&nbsp;really can't imagine what else is going to be thrown my way.

lets just start with I&nbsp;miss cassie! I miss here an insane amount. I&nbsp;find that I try to just put it in the back of my head but that it piles up and then something goes wrong and i cry because i miss her and not so much for what is actually going on at the time. I hate school without her here. I&nbsp;hate that there is not a chance of me running into her or getting to see her during the weekend when we can share about our hectic week. I&nbsp;love and hate that she is in Purchase New York. I&nbsp;love it because i know it is perfect for her and because she is following her dreams and taking advantage of all the amazing things she is capable of. BUt i hate that we have to be so far away from each other. Honestly it just sucks. I&nbsp;know we got an exstended time together than most friends do but we've been through so much more than most and we've been together longer than most. this year marks 9 years of our friendship and although we are both extremely strong on our own we genuinely enjoy each others' company and enjoy seeing and talking together. I&nbsp;know we can talk via emails, messangers, letters, and phone, but its just not the same and this week we have barely been able to coordinate our schedules and we havent been as busy as we will get so i'm scared and worried about not being able to keep in touch as often as i would like us to. I mean we don't have a lot to say when we talk and really we just tell each other what all we've done but i like talking to her for long period's of time and i like seeing her and this week its been maybe a text a day just saying hi and not really getting to talk. we were supposed to have a phone call but i got too busy and so did she and then our phones were dieing so it just couldn't happen. so i just am having a tough time adjusting to this i suppose or maybe my emotions are just heightened and thats where i'm displacing them and letting them go to because really its the only thing really wrong with things right now. 

but i hate that feeling of being on the verge of tears and i hate even more when you start crying and you don't want to be comeuse you're in a public place"

But yeah slight pain as my numbness wares off and i can't take pills until the bleeding stops and i can take out the gauze that are back in my mouth.&nbsp;<br /><br />so i just had nitrous and some local injections and thats it but I got lucky because i only had to have my upper two done and they were already fully in my mouth so it was a realy simple thing. so yeah, I'm just resting until I can eat something and spending the night at my parents house before i head home tomorrow morning to finish healing in my own apartment.&nbsp;<br /><br />other than that, there's not much else going on today.&nbsp;<br /><br />no pain, lots of pudding, and good recovery<br />Kim&nbsp;</p>"

I don't really know how to tell you this, but our romance is over. I think I realized it when i changed tenis shoes in your closet and I saw you sit on Donald Duck. I'm sure you're open enough to understand how awful i felt. I'm returning your ring to you, but I'll keep your left ear as a memory. You should also know that I was interviewed by the times about a new life as a clone.

"event","&nbsp;so I may be getting a new journal one of these days since no one really reads mine anyways and it'll probably just be for me but if you add it that's cool too. I'll be sure to update this one with the new name. I also may just edit my friends on here or something to those who update and read mine and that I read theirs. no hard feelings if you don't read mine and sorry if I don't read yours but we all know how it goes.&nbsp;

Anywho. .. to the point well sort of....to the random thoughts in my head that I am caring enough to express.

I think my mom dislikes me strongly...i think she always has. I know my dad and brother love me :) so that's good, right?

I'm basically living with my boyfriend. I bring a suitcase and stay for like a week at a time :) This keeps me happy, but without him...I am homeless because my place sucks massive ass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Listen to Kate Voegele on Myspace, or see her perform on ONE TREE HILL, she is awesome! her name is Mia on OTH but that's her actual name above^^^^^^^^^^^.

My brother's wedding is this weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am a bridesmaid. The dress which used to fit perfectly, if not a bit loose....is now quite snug...fits, but is difficult to zip. I gained a few of the pounds I lost back which is definately my downfall and things are being taken care of to fix this issue but the whole dress thing really upsets me....I want my bro's wedding perfect...those of you who know me well know how much this wedding means to me because of the first time he got married and how much that broke him and how big a step this is for him to plunge back in....luckily this time around, the girl is much better! Back to me feeling ugly, fat, and did i mention ugly. The dress is already a size that isn't me but is the size dress I needed in this style...yeah,&nbsp;definately in the other dress i tried on at the shop, I was much smaller than the dress i am wearing's size. Which I am actually smaller than both so I shouldn't let it get to me, but it's hard. Some of you understand where I'm coming from on this, and some of you don't. I'm not looking for sympathy on this issue or even any one to tell me I'm beautiful. I am learned that I am beautiful! I&nbsp; know this now, that was a big step for me to take and I have learned not to take a step backwards but it still doesn't help me with the dress and the few pounds I put back on. I know I'll lose the weight again, but it won't be quick enough to look amazing in the dress by saturday. though everyone I show the dress to on me says that they love it and that i look great so maybe I should just focus on that and ignore the rest....besides the only place that doesn't look so great, in my opinion, is the upper back and my hair will be down and straight (my hair has gooten really long) and that will cover it so why should I even fret over this. Yes, I need to keep working out and eating better, but no I don't need to worry about one dress one time even if it is my brothers wedding because no matter what I am seeing....I know others are seeing something better. I'm glad I am working this all out while sitting here typing, but I am sorry to any of you who actually do read this and have read through all of this. You know me, I post rarely and don't care about cutting it :)

well that's the main thing in my head but I think I will talk about a few other random things before moving on.

school is not great. I mean so far my grades are fine, from what I know, but I have no motivation for going to class which as we almost all know....is BAD! But anywho, I'm just kind of burnt out, which happens when you're only on the second year and you are already a junior when you only came in with 6 credits...meaning I did most my work...54 hour of work here. But see my reasoning is I don't want to be here forever and this way I will graduate in 09 and star grad school, if i get in( don't even get me started on that worry) and I will be done with my masters in like 2.5 or less years. Then I can get a job and start a family (hopefully with Kagun, but we'll see).&nbsp;

moving on.....

Kagun and I...we're good. even with me living here, we haevn't fought much this week and we've been careful about the whole living here thing because we don't want to step on each other's toes and we don't want to over do it. We are almost to 7 months of dating....I'm so excited. This is my longest relationship as most of you know and I just don't want it to go away. I love him so much. More than I have ever loved anyone....or at least in a different way.&nbsp;

and again....

V-day.... I have no idea what to get him. I've only had one guy on v-day before and well it was James....if you remember, it also ended that day(call me heartless all you want, but he made me want to gag at that point as my boyfriend...I'm sorry). The only other male valentine I had was actually Kagun last year...i told him I loved him, he told me he loved Laura(the ex)...this was not a highlight, obviously and honestly I'm a bit scared of this...I know it wn't but part of me is still shaken. anywho, gifts....any ideas? besides chocolate...no more chocolate, that's all that i ever get him with his gifts or as his gifts, etc. I want to get him something good, not too expensive, because i'm broke, but something decent.&nbsp;

......

I think that's all I will rant about. at least for now. Listen to the music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ignore me or read me, your choice.

"event","<p>Seems I only update when I need to procrastinate about doing something else. Currently, I am avoiding unpacking and cleaning my room. The sad thing as some of you might have realized is that I have been home for exactly a week...and have yet to unpack. Well love, the reason is...I hate it here and spent my time at Kagun's. :)<br /><br />However, I am in the process of preparing for school which starts monday and he is at his parent's house cleaning out his old room, thus I am here. Soon as I do at least a little something productive, other than my shower, I will go to the store for the rest of the items needed for dinner tonight. I had fun last night cooking for him and am planning on making dinner again tonight. What can I say, I like playing house. Though, I have to wait and see if he's even going to be home because he has one of my ingredients in his car.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moving on...Christmas and My birthday have passed. They were ok. Could have been a hell of a lot better. I had one phone call telling me my friend's mom had passed away (please take a moment for Mrs. Raju, Natasha's mom) .........and I had a call from Kimmy, telling me she was in the hospital ( and as of this morning she is still there) {side note: Seaton Northwest in Austin/Cedar Park area room 439}. So chritsmas and stuff was kind of a bummer.<br /><br />Good note: Kagun came and visited me while I was stuck at home!!!!!!!!!!!! I love that boy! and even better he loves me. Our 6th month anniversary is this month; granted that's our official anniversary but really we've been together for over a year now..but that's just complicated to explain if you don't already know.&nbsp;<br /><br />(Rant Beginning)<br />Small Rant: Stupid bitch of a drunk slut roommate apparently welcomed herself into my room and shower while I was gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />(Rant over)<br /><br />Thanks to the lovely Cassie, I finally got to download some more music. I got:<br />Jordin Sparks-Tattoo<br />Baby Bash- Cyclone<br />Avril Lavigne- When you're gone {no comments people, it's a half decent song}<br />Saving Jane- Girl Next Door<br />Superchick- One girl revolution<br />Paramore- Misery Business<br /><br />I'll get more soon, I'm just trying to figure out what else to get.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'll probably update next week with schedule and thoughts on classes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Heart, Stars, and Horseshoes.<br />Kim<br /></p>"

It's finals week and I only have four final...However, I have 3 tomorrow and 1 on wednesday, so if you thought your school life sucked, i've probably got you beat.

"event","<p>So as most of you know, I went home this past weeked. I tag-temmed home with Kimmy to make the drive a bit more fun. I stopped when we got to Fort Worth so I could say goodbye to her and then continued on to Denton. Once home, I went to the dorm to see Talie and give her a present. Then I went to my apartment and made dinner, cleaned my room, emptied part of my car, and cassie came over for a bit before I had to come to Kagun's to work on my paper since my microsoft word would not open for some reason. I wrote my paper and typed my homework and then went back to my apartment and took a bubble bath before updating my women's studies blog, which is on another blog site. I went to bed and then Kagun came over around 4, because for some reason he wanted to be with me and I of course am always willing to let that happen. He drove me to class this morning, early, so that I could finish the homework since my book has not shown up yet and I have to keep going to the bookstore to copy problems, which really sucks by the way. Then I went to my classes. I got my italian test back and I made an 85, so that totally rocked my day. Then I got out of W.S early and came to Kagun's to take him to class and then return to rewrite that paper since she gave us an extra day to change things as we would like to. I just finished and some time to pass before I go to the optional conversation class for Italian at Art Six, local coffee shop :) I figured I might as well stay at his apartment because I have nothing better to do and I can use it as a break from homework for a little bit.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have a test tomorrow in Environmental Science which I also need to be studying for, but I figure I can do that tonight because I've been in class everyday but one since I was in the hospital and I think I know enough for a multiple choice test.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well I think I'll go relax, maybe do algebra homework, and watch tv :)<br /><br />Ciao!</p>"

"event","ok so I'm at work. Its way too early to be awake and I have to sit here for 8 hours...hopefully less if I can convince James that I should leave earlier.&nbsp;

Carly and Peter got here last night and we unloaded my car which was full of stuff and moved my bed into my apartment. Then we went to dinner with Kagun and then back to his apartment to sleep. I didn't get to bed until about two...which sucks when you have to be at work by 8 and you were exhausted when you finally did go to sleep.

Today, I'm hoping to finish moving everything, maybe start cleaning the room and then go to sleep so that tomorrow we can finish cleaning and then go shopping for the rest of the things I need for my apartment :) Unfortunately, Kagun has dance tonight so he can't help me move but him letting us crash at his apartment is wonderful of him. He makes me so happy.&nbsp;

The RAs are all at breakfast and the football players are either at practice or asleep, so I really have no point in working the front desk. I think James is going to have me do things later but other than that I have to just sit here and worry about haveing 25 hours after work to get everything out and to make the room sparkle.&nbsp;

I'll be home at the end of the week...so we need to have a get together and do something to celebrate the end of summer. Granted for me its the only summer I've had. I've been working and going to school all summer.

Well that's about it for now. I'll keep everyone posted and I'll take pictures of my apartment when I'm fully moved in and when I'm technically allowed to move in since that isn't until wednesday.

My uncle Dave on my dad's side died yesterday. My grandmother has Alzeimers.&nbsp;

I'm working on moving and packing.

I'm really excited for Carly to come help me move.

RLT is starting for the RAs (Residence Life Training and Resident Adviosrs) which means most my people I loved throughout the year are moving back in as I move out :)

I work one more time monday and then I'm done. I should have close to 30 hours pay on my last check.

"event","Just found out that no one is coming in at midnight...meaning I need to work until 4am....however I htink I may have found a way to get it covered so that I can sleep.&nbsp;

Currently my back is killing me, though the stomach pain has disappeared and thank goodness for that.&nbsp;

I'm wanting to write a lot lately, but have not had the inspiration for the correct themes or diction. I got a really awesome notebook at the store today, although I really don't need anymore notebooks to write in.

Things are going okay. I need to find boxes...badly, I need to start packing. I need to study for my finals. Most of all, I need to relax because my mother may be right in that the pain in my stomach could be the start of an olsar* Yay me. Right?!

Anywho, I guess that'll be about all for tonight. I'll probably update tomorrow when I work again as it seems to be the only time I really sit down bored at the computer anymore."

"event","So I havent slept much in the past two days and I've been feeling sick to my stomach. Still haven't fixed my tire, need to do that this weekend at some point between actually trying to sleep and working. I'm working extra this weekend. I'm working today for four hours, I'm half done actually, and saturday and sunday 4-12. Plus I have finals this week. Oh and I have to be out of the dorm by the 14th at 5. Lease starts the 15th at 12....sounds fun huh?!

Anywho, I've been slacking on talking to people because I've been spending a lot of time at a friends apartment which doesn't have internet yet, so there hasn't been a way for me to talk to many of you.&nbsp;

Well there's not much else to tell you all about, so I hope you're all having a good summer!

"event","so i got a flat tire, which sucks because I can't really get it fixed up here without the paperwork and my dad....

I've also realized that my car is another subject that easily stresses me out when something goes wrong.&nbsp;

Anywho...i'm going to cry"

"event","so it has been awhile since I updated and since I'm on a break from my government class I will update quickly about things. 

I have not been able to sleep or relax in almost a week which is really taking its effects on my body and my health. That's no bueno, that's for sure. Plus I just found out that I'm getting paid crapily because I'm not an RA...which is not what my job is so it is completely rediculous, but it's alright, I'm just going to basically screw over the system by not working as hard as I have been and by only doing the bare minimum. I don't really need the money, that's not why I took this job. I took is to live in Victory and I can do basically nothing and still live there, so that is what I intend to do. 

TOday is my first day off in a very long time and I have class until 4 but then I should be hanging out with Kagun and hopefully getting to relax and have some fun. I have bascially told everyone that if they call me to work they will get no answer because there is no way in HELL I am doing anything today but school and free time.

I need to make sure I tape SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE though because I probably won't see it. Plus ONE TREE HILL is on, but they put those episodes on the website so I can watch that during my shift this weekend.

well, back to class I go.

But by the way...with my new, not going to do much attitude...I can come home more...at least once a month :) which I probably will since there are some important people having birthdays soon ;)

have&nbsp; good day all.

I want a new tattoo.

"event","<p>Just an update about what's been going on.<br /><br />Wednesday night I got in an accident, I'm alright and now I have my mom's car for a bit. Thursday I had lunch with Kimmy and Natasha before going by the school to see people and then over to Alex's house to see him and Kevin. I watched So You Think You Can Dance and I was very excited for the new seson. I got up early friday and met u with Carly and Kathryn at Graduation, where three of my four boys graduated :( So proud of them by the way :) Then drove back up here with the girls, saw Pirates. Which was even better than the first :)!!!! Met up with Kagun and came back to the dorm :) Saturday morning we woke up and got ready for Scarby, which kicked ass. Hung out there all day! (ps. Kagun is totally adorable) Then came home and met some of the staff with the camp, hung with Talie at the front desk, took a shower, and then went to bed. Now it's my first day of working the desk and I have to admit I'm a bit worried but I know it won't be bad. :/ The dorm is quiet right now because all the cheerleaders are at the gym but in a few hours this will be a scary place :)&nbsp;<br /><br />Well that's my update for now.<br /><br />Hope everyone is having a good summer!<br /><br />Hearts, Stars, and Horseshoes!<br />Kim<br /><br /></p>"

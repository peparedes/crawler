"event","I LOVE ANIKA-ROSE. DO I? I DO I DO I DO I DOOOO-OOOOOOOO..

ANYWAY, I MISS HER A LOT. I REMEMBER WHEN SHE USED TO MAKE ME LAUGH ABOUT MY -[aZn]- LOOKING BOYFRIENDS AND I USED TO MAKE FUN OF HER AND HOW SHE'S FROM THE LBC WITH HER TIMBZ AND HOODRAT CLOTHING.

I MISS HER. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY. SHE HELPED ME DISCOVER MY FOURTH HOLE. SOMETIMES, I WISH I HAD THREE LIKE HER. BUT YOU KNOW, MY FOURTH HOLE MIGHT BENEFIT ME ONE OF THESE DAYS. 

ANIKA ALSO TEACHED ME HOW TO LOOK DOWN ON THE GROUND WHEN I WALK. BECAUSE ONE TIME, I STEPPED IN DOG POOP IN MY HIGH-TOP CHUCK TAYLOR'S. AFTER I GATHERED A NICE CLUMP OF FECES ON MY KICKS, I STEPPED FOOT IN DENISE CONWAY'S GRANDPA'S OLD SCHOOL, TAN COLORED, MERCEDES BENZ. IT SMELLED. I SMELLED. I MADE EVERYONE SMELL. I MADE EVERYONE SMELL ME. 

ANIKA IS THE PERFECT CHEF. HER&I LOVE TO MAKE MAC&CHEESE SOUP. WHAT EXACTLY IS MAC&CHEESE SOUP? IT IS MACARONI & CHEESE, WATERED DOWN. AFTER WE FINISH MAKING THIS EXSQUISITE DISH, WE LIKE TO FEED IT TO THE HUNGRY (AKA DENISE, KATIE, & KATRINA).

MISS ANIKA-ROSE MAKES ME A BETTER PERSON. WITHOUT HER, I'D DIE.

PEACE, I'M OUT. 

YOURS TRULY,
MICHELLE JOY CARNERO"

i'm sick of finding the velocity of a fucking duck.
i'm tired of stupid spanish her unorganized teaching that just screws everyone over.
i think 1000 words on a hard news story as a project grade on ""is religion a priority to teenagers"" (a last resort topic) is stupid.
i'm tired of reading a book i know holds a disappointing ending. and looking for & analyzing quotes.
and last, but certainly not least...
I'M TIRED OF (or at least trying..and then failing) ANALYZING MATH. SERIOUSLY. WHEN ARE WE GONNA EVER SIT AND THINK, ""GEE. I WONDER WHAT THE HEIGHT OF THAT RIPPLE IS. GOOD THING I KNOW THE EQUATION. AND I THINK AFTER THAT I'LL FIND THE FIRST AND SECOND DERIVATIVES OF THE EQUATION OF THE PARABOLA STARTING AT THE COORDINATES XY.""

my gosh. this year makes me feel stupid. i spend half my classes clueless thinking ""what the fuck did he/she  just say? what are they talking about?""

and its really cold."

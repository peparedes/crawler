i have to clean like a mother fucker. my room is a diiiisaster! 
i have to go to bed extremely early, as well, 5 am rolls around quickly.  friday's my walking day. buses dont get to the mall at 6:30 am. booo! it's a niiice walk, though. i love it. i wasted so much time last friday, as i was walking. taking pictures, being slooow, i was almost late. but i haven't been getting nearly enough sleep the past few weeks. i need to start being responsible. woooo-wooo! it's hard to get back into that habit. i haven't been in it for a month, roughly. i haven't really been workin' too much. but it's definitely picking up again. i'm so glad. i love my job.i hope tomorrow goes well. should, anyway. i'm pretty organised. i gotta do non-ads as i'm signing. whoop. 
ok. enough procrastinating. offfff to cleeeaaaaan!

"event","life is a big puzzle. and i love it.
i may be starting school in may. i've got to find my transcripts. my parents don't really know anything that's going on, but they definitely think i'm rushing into things. apparently we need to discuss. hah. whatever. i ain't discussing shit until i've figured it all out. then i'll let them know. i'm out here living, they don't help me with my everyday choices and decisions. i may or may not call them tonight, we'll see.
anywho.. school! i was at st lawrence yesterday with tam, and i thought i'd check out what school's were where again, for the massage therapy. and recently, oshawa has been brought up around me. three times, in the least, it's been brought up in my presence. and there was trillium college on the website, so i got there, to find out there's a campus in kingston! whaaat?! in kingston! woot. so then i check out where it's at, and like.. the website sucks, it's very uninformative. it has a map of where the campus is, says downtown, but when you click on the thingy for the exact address it says frontenac mall. but.. frontenac mall isn't downtown, it's actually down the road from me! so i called, and then i find out that they will be offering massage therapy starting may 28th. and it's not too late to sign up! so i made an appointment with the director of the campus for today. so i did that today. we talked some, she gave me a tour. there's an information session on monday. and BMO is going to be there, and apparently they're good for students. soooo. ah! it IS fast. not so much rushing on my part, but that seems it's just last minute with the school? i'm not sure. but i want this. it's 88 weeks, 2200 hours, two years(roughly). that's IT. that's it!
i also figure.. why pick up and go? why spend so much more money, i'm ok here. i'm having fun. it gets rough, but i'm happy right now. i just want to get school over and done with and get my life on. and this is so perfect. seems so perfect.
i asked her if i could get denied, she says any student could get denied, but they primarily run by first come first serve. she likes me, too. so she'll be rootin' for me. oh god. i would love for this to work out.
ok! enough!
adios!"

one of the sales manager's asked me to do an announcement, for her. because she really liked the announcements i was doing last week. and she's so nice. haha. she's kept saying i was the best, and i have to call her before i leave so someone else can take over, but they just wouldn't be as good as mine. it was a little mean, but it was funny. she's great.
at some point in the day, we somewhat crossed paths, and made eye contact, like we kind of wanted to talk to each other.. but nothing was really coming out, it was a little awkward, then she kind of blurts out ""i just want to tell you i think you have a golden voice."" my heart melted. awww. thank you! 
i love my work. really hard. they are grade-a people. i'm glad i can be part of that, and express myself that way. and then there's the drama. oh boy! it's not perfect!

i'm in the midst of making hemp! yay. it's gonna look nice. it's serbian hemp, it is so different than regular hemp. it's wooly, and scratchy.
ohman. night before last we went to the bar.. it was a fun night. two dollah tall boys. i dont really drink beer, usually. well.. the past like three times i kinda liked it. i used to hate beer so much. like grossed out by it, almost. and for some reason, i like it now. weird. but yeah, first time drinking beer all night. i drank lots, and fast. and like, i kept getting them. you drink faster when it's free! hahah. oh it did not turn out well. i dont know if i'll get drunk off beer again, unless i have two days to recover. it's funny though. i always get sick my first time trying out new alcohol.
i have the apartment to myself until 6:30. wooot.

my brother is still here. we'll be leaving at some point today. well, he will. i need to do laundry before then. i just want the guest gone, or up, so i can move around and make more noise. turn the music up a little.
i dont want to be just sitting here, but currently it's all i can really do. i don't really want to go back to sleep, and i can't really go into the living room to sit, there's nothing there, 'cept my brother sleeping on the couch.
i think i'm gonna make coffee today. i didn't have any yesterday, i don't think the day before, either.
my side of the room keeps shrinking. tam put her tent up. it's takes up a lot of fucking room. i had to move my desk back. indoing so, we managed to spill my zen garden, i got fucking sand all down my shirt. and now my seat is right up against my BED! YAY! i'm not pleased. ugh. whatever. it probably won't stay up too long. i hope not, anyway.
although, it is killer for hot boxin'. hehe.

my computer is FINALLY in my bedroom. i love it so hard. i need new speakers. i wanna get a subwoofer and jazz.
i kind of feel like today's a day, i should be at work. pat isn't in all week, so i doubt my stock will get dealt with. I didn't get a lot yesterday, at all. maybe i'll get more today and tomorrow. apparently there are a lot of CIP's that i will receive. oh boy! reductions, markups, reductions going back to the original price. that's the worst. because i have to scratch off all the reduced tags. grunt work! oh well. i still have old cip's that i haven't finished closing. it's impossible to do one this and follow through on it. shit just keeps coming up. oh well. such is life.
i'm ecstatic, there is food! we went grocery shopping. woot. but now i don't know what to eat. it sucks ass.
oh shit, we went to liquidation world. i picked up a few things. one of which was a six dollar shit. she rings it all up the order comes to 6 something. it was nuts. there are mad discounts! i should pick up stuff i need. but i don't want to go outside today. it's apparently going to -36. it's -20 right now, feels like -30. it'll be cold up until thursday. not THIS cold, but still cold enough.
today would be perfect if a few people were online. boo you!
two of them aren't working today! (nik and deb!)
anywho. i should find something to do, otherwise this post could go on forever!! ah!

"event","it's sweet because it's sunday and i'm home alone.
i was pissed off when i got up, though. so the girls went to ottawa to go swimming. and i wasn't invited, which is fine with me, until this morning..  and you can't even call it being invited.. it's the way things have been happening lately, and it's pissing me off. it goes like this ""are you coming tomorrow?"" ""going where?"" ""Well, we're going to so and so bar."" ""Oh... uhm, i don't know."" (holy shit, i just got bombarded with messages on msn.. this is sooo strange.) anyway.. or, if it doesn't go like that it goes like this ""hey, we're going out here.. you can come, but you gotta call and ask first."" and that is what happened this morning. i was like 'fuck that'. i don't want to have to ASK permission to go out with my friends. because we're all supposed to be friends, right? whatever. it's just really annoying.
oh, i made the PERFECT omelette today. mmm. it was sooo good. i went to produce town, got mushrooms, peaches, an orange, eggs, i think that's it. mm. i had ham here, i fried the onions and mushrooms, the ham, too. oh god, it was so good.
anyway.. it's beautiful outside.
i have to clean and shit, but i think i'm gonna skip it and go outside.
it's too nice!

oh. i have to shower tomorrow! (reminder)
holy fuck a lot happens in a year. crazy, massive things! ouch. it huuurts! haha.
yay. it was good. haha. minus six months of it! three months of it. (being sad and depressed is not good.)
but alas! i have survived! wooooowooooo! yay! haha. i'm a nerd. 
i haven't posted in forever. it's crazy. but i haven't been around, at all. yay! i like not being on the cooooomputer. i liiiike it. (haha, i had my msn on for like three days straight, and i got all of like two messages from people (H)) well.. i loved the past week. loooved it. it's really fucking cold in here.
i'm going out to the bar tomorrow. i'm so excited. i'm totally wearing my red, blak, white skirt. with FISHNETS! yay! i love wearing them. i just never have a reason to. woowoo! i'm gonna freeeeeze :D
we're gonna have fun. woot.
ohmygod. modest mouse's new single. i don't know. i don't know. maybe because i'm high. but i did NOT like one part in it. i looove the rest.
hm. new cd! NEW MODEST MOUSE CD! OHMYFRIGGINLORD!!!!
alright.. on with the show.
<lj-cut text=""cd listings!"">
it's my pickings for the year's cds! haha.. well, the ones i've listened to. (which isn't much...)

<b>The Sufferer and the Witness, Rise Against.</b>
I was completely attached to this cd. Incredibly, emotionally enthralled with it. Amazing cd.

<b>Open Your Eyes, Snow Patrol</b>
Currently in love with it. In LOVE. Whole heartedly..  Perfect.

<b>Louder Now, Taking Back Sunday </b>
Definitely listened to this cds a few times in a row. Great cd. Well done.

<b>A City By the Light Divided, Thursday </b>
Good cd. Much more to the likes of their first, <i>Full Collapse</i>. Very well put together.

<b>The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me, Brand New </b>
Eeeexcellent cd. Much advancement in their sound. Maturity, oh wonderful! 

<b>Black Parade, My Chemical Romance</b>
This cd definitely took me for a loop. Excellent choice of style. Great music. Sounds great. 

<b>Billy Talent II, Billy Talent</b>
Good cd. Sounds a lot like their first. But I really liked their first, so I ain't complanin'. Just lookin' for a differentish sound, and stuff  next time 'round.

<b>Dusk and Summer, Dashboard Confessional</b>
Fun light cd. Not in love with it. Nothing overly passionate. Good eaaaasy listening.

<b>The Red Tree, Moneen</b>
Pretty good cd. I listen to it here and there. But too much of some things is not a great thing.

<b>B'Day, Beyonce</b>
Heard a couple songs from this cd, enjoyed them. Thought I'd enjoy the cd.

And that's that. I didn't plan on laying it out like that.. but that's how it happened. Good stuff.</lj-cut>
Oh, tonight was good. I got home, felt shitty. Had people over. Wrote a little in my journal. Smoked some pot, got mad happy! And chipper and shit. Yay!
Not so good things have been happening.. or not happening.. heh. Relationships are lame! Yay!
Oh. I'm excited! Yay! Because! It's only 11.26, and I work at 11 tomorrow! I went to bed at 1.30 last night and got up at 7/30. Today was crappy, too. I felt like absolute shit. My body was aching. And it was slow-going. Like sloooow. Stupid Mensware! Damn you CIPs! But yeah. I'm done with that now. Three days is enough. (People are doing more tomorrow.. well, more. They have to finish it.) I'm in luggage tomorrow. Crazy shit! They changed the Sales Managers around in the store. Sweeeeet! I get to work under BOTH Supervisor's I'm not working under. I'm excited. This whole debacle happened pretty perfectly. I think working under Deb was the best training ever. She was a great Boss. The other two are more laid back. Not so in a rush all the time. It'll be a nice change. Except we'll see about my hours and plans for luggage and accessories. I'm gonna weasel my way in there and do good shit. Then I'm outta there. School next year! WOO! I have to look into that shit. See if I need any credits or something. Mhmm.
Anywho. I could go on probably for hours longer. But I'm headin' to bed.
I'm excited to sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!

"event","Honesty would have been nice. Especially from someone I love so much. And care so much about. It has affected our friendship thus far. I'm going to bring it up, so I can get over it. Because I tried to just swallow it, and well, I don't even feel comfortable enough to be as friendly and nice as I've been. It sucks.
Christmas was amazing. I love my family so much. They're fantastic. I totally got a dress form for Christmas. I'm so excited about it. I got a lot of books I had asked for. (Not the postsecret one, though! Booo!) Political and social issues books. One of them is called ""How to spend 50 Billion dollars to make the world a better place."" I started it, it's really damn good. Well written, in layman's terms, of course. Haha! But it's been postponed for another book. The Hobbit! It's so captivating. Lisa sent it home with me. She's great.
I picked up a shift tomorrow. I'm keeping my job at the Bay. I'm happy about that. I love it there. Except, I think I want to find a real job. I'm probably going to work at the Bookstore, too. I love it there. I want to manage to be Head of Luggage and Accessories. I can do it. It won't be hard. I could almost take charge of jewellery. Well, not really. But shit, I'm a really good worker, and I picked up on everything faster than anyone else that's there. Muahhaha! But yeah, getting luggage and accessories won't be too hard. The only problem is there aren't enough hours. I'll probably be juggling between Jewellery and Luggage. Which is ok. Maybe find a second part time job until hours pick up. We'll see. We'll see how things roll out.
The girls were supposed to come home today. But they left a message.. They won't be in until tomorrow.
Of course my parents got on my case about being anorexic. Ugh. As if. I was so insulted. And yeah sure, they're worried, but please. I lost 50 pounds in something like 6 months. I'm pretty happy with where I'm at, though. So yeah. 
I don't want to be home alone. 
I want company."

"event","my dad is hilarious.
i went home this weekend, my parents are so good to me. they picked me up in Toronto, dropped me off at Lisa's. We went to Phil's, I slept over there. I told my mom I'd be home in the afternoon, but I didn't end up getting home til like 5:30ish. They weren't mad or anything.. nope, not mad, in fact the first thing my dad says when I walk in is ""Did you get laaaaaaid??!?!"" ""*griiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin*"" ""Wipe off that sex smile!"" it was hilarious.
Yep. Then we had dinner and went shopping. I didn't really buy anything. I have no money for Christmas presents this year. It's really shitty. But I'm gonna be making stuff for people. I really need to actually start on that. I don't have too much time left. I don't have too much time period. i work everyday until the 24th. I'm off at 12:15 that day.
i'm so friggin' excited, man.
i think lisa will be hanging out with us on Christmas night. i'm so excited. yay!

i think that if i lose any more weight, people will really start to worry. the only thing is... i have no idea what i'm doing, but i like it. i wouldn't mind losing another ten pounds. i would find myself attractive, but i don't think anyone else would.. i probably will definitely put on weight though, since i'm going home for longer than i had originally planned. and there's goddamn christmas baking! booooo-hiss!
anywho.. i'm gonna probably get to bed. (first night of not smoking pot in a looooong time, strangeness!)

I started a post this morning, and it didn't save the draft. AND I didn't copy first! It's lame!
Oh well.. You know how you do something you already know the outcome of? Beforehand... you know? But you do it anyway! That's what it was.
I love pictures and photography. I wanna take a class pretty badly. I want a cooool camera. I want a film camera with an lcd screen.
Yep. I have to work tomorrow! Boo! I wanna stay hooome!
Oh well. Life goes on.
My internet is back up! YAY! I can post freeeely!
My internet busted, somehow. Out of the blue, after almost two months, it stops working. So I called up Cogeco, no luck, they gave me the number for D-Link, so I call them. Then we find out that there is an essential folder missing from another folder. So they told me to call Dell. So I call the only number in the Dell book.. which is clearly stated in it that's it's a U.S number. But.. there is no Canadian number. So I called it anyway. I'm talking to this guy explaining everything I've done, all that's wrong and blah blah. So we get some leeway, but then he figures out that I called the wrong section or whatever. He transfers me to another department. Then the guy in THAT department starts talking to me, or maybe I blurted a bunch of shit out (I tend to do that). Then he's all ""Well, I see here you're in Canada.."" ""Yeah! I am! But there's not Canadian number in the book!"" ""Oh, really?? I'm sorry about that.."" ""Oh, it's ok."" hahaha. It was funny. I was having so much fun with those guys. Funniest part.. they were ALL foreign. I have a hard time understanding accents, makes for fun when troubleshooting.. I seriously, couldn't understand a thing the guy from D-link was saying. It was funny. I made him repeat himself so many times. (There was a lot of background noise, too.) It was nuts. But yeah, so he gives me the Canuck number, call them. And like.. I had already tried everything he suggested, so finally the outcome was, I had to download something from my roomies computer to download on mine. And now my net is fixed. It's good times. I went three days without it. It wasn't even that bad. Granted I was working most of it. But still.  I missed just being able to post in lj, whatever is on my mind.
But yeah. That's a blurb and a half!
I don't even think I'm done.

"event","i LOVE my day off!
It's been amazing. I woke up around 10. A little earlier, talked with the girls for a bit, before they left for school. Social! Yay! Then I .. did something for a bit. I was lazy, probably mopey. The I decided to make breakfast! Oh man! There was an egg left. I was so excited! And there's bacon! AND CHEEEESE! That's ALL you need for the perfect breakfast. Seriously. Anyway, so I cooked up breakfast. All the timing was off, so I had cold bacon with warm eggs (but melted cheese),a cool toast, and hoooot coffee. I sat down and ate it ALL! Oh, it was insane. I even had peanut butter on the toast! It was crazy. There are actually crusts still laying in my plate. That was awesome. Then I started to budget my money. Don't like what it's coming out to. Goddamn! S'ok! After that, I divvied up the laundry. (I also made a plan of action.. it consists of 
""Get laundry money
booze
do laundry
make some hemp""
that's hilarious, man. That's exactly the order it's going to take place, too.
So, while I was divvying up the laundry, I was talkin' to my cousin Eric. He's the cutest kid, ever. We talked about a few things, but the most important part was this ""Your parents suggest that I stay [he's going to my place for new year's] and do my semester there. If it's ok with my mom."" OHMYGOD that would be so good! For him AND my brother. I know it won't happen. It's the ""if it's ok with my mom"" part. But I like the thought of it. It'll keep Dom out of pot for a while longer. That reassures me. And it will be awesome for Eric. He needs to get away. He's such a good kid!
Anyway, yeah. After that, I got stoned. And I'm so happy. It was such a tiny bowl. I'm glad I didn't smoke more. Now I have some left for later. I'm saving it for laundry. I love doing laundry stoned.
What I love most about this day.. I'm not rushing anything. It's taking as long as I want it to take. And I love that. MMMMM coffeeee. I want another cup.
And now we're here. The story continues. Haha, I'm so high. I love it.
I'm gone, kids.
Remember : Music makes life!!!!

OHSHIT, the reason I posted in the first place was for this statement: ""HOLY FUCK IT FEELS LIKE ITS TWELEVE AM!!!!"""

Oh. I am so disappointed in myself. Like.. extremely, aside from feeling like a piece of shit lately. I now find out that I really like jewelry. Yeah, man. It's fucking crazy. I totally want jewelry. Lots of it. And I also found out, my ring finger is 7 and a half. Hahaha. Not that I need THAT measurement, it's still good to know. I kind of want to buy a ring, anyway. Hahah. I'm so lame. I'll probably buy a ring I like and wear it on that finger, anyway. I don't really like rings on the other fingers. It's because my fingers are big.
My mom is trying to convince me to move back home. I'm so thinking about it. I really don't want to. It depresses me so badly. I am in somewhat of a rut. It's shitty. I kind of don't really like it here. I mean, it's ok. But I don't feel comfortable. I kind of want to find my own place. Or move in with someone that isn't my best friend. Then there isn't a friendship to lose. Or something. I don't know.
I gotta email my sister about my mom's Christmas present. I'm totally excited. Oh, and my brothers. Woot. 
Anywho, I'm bored outta my wits. There are no boys to flirt with, boooo-hiss!
I'm gonna find something somewhat productive to do. (hemp)

I can get a plane ticket to Louisville for 277!! Craaaaazy! Hahaha, I forgot I had signed up for some bullshit thing to warn me when the prices change. Oh well.
In other news. I start work today.
Some asshole is in town. Some asshole that I do not want to see, or encounter again. Why the FUCK is he here? It's fucking crazy. Following me around?! GO BACK TO KITCHENER! It made me sick to my stomach. It was weird.
Kelly called, they had a job for me. Working weekends. I said no. Sadness. It's for Rona, telling people about air miles. I'll pass, thanks.
Christmas is around the corner! I'm so excited. I hope I get a lot of hours at this job. Man, this company would be so perfect for me, had it not been bought out (JUST RECENTLY) by some Americans. Taking as it's part of our heritage, and history. The Hudson Bay Trading Company. Now, not owned by us. Can we not keep anything true? goddamn! I don't even want to be Canadian anymore. I don't wanna be anything. This bullshit planet. I take that back, I'd much rather be a canuck over many other nationalities.
I just don't fit in anywhere, is all. Sooner you learn to accept it, the better off you are.
But I love English Beat.
I'm gonna go rock out, now.

I gots ta do laundry today. We haven't done any since last time.. haha. it's been almost two weeks or something crazy. All our clothes is dirty. Not so cool.
It's so chilly. I think last night I passed out and did not move at all. I woke up in the EXACT position I fell asleep in. That happens a lot when I go to bed burnt out. Probably every time. It's crazy. It's an incredibly deep sleep, too. Craaaaazy.

I'm getting a job today, and tomorrow. At the goddamn mall! It's ok, I definitely won't be dealing with rotten kids (teenagers). So it's ok. I only applied at two places. And have interviews at both.

"event","Last night was definitely an adventure.
The girls got home at around 5:30-6ish. I was just finishing up my cookies. Then Tams and I went out for a smoke, when something got in my eye. It may have happened inside, I'm not really sure. It was itchy and stuff. But I left it, no big deal, it's red and itchy, it's happened before. Then we have dinner while watching Roseanne. At some point I notice there's this huge water pocket ON my eyeball. Every time I look by my nose, the pocket scrunches. It freaked me out. So I called telehealth, and got some guy with a pretty thick accent, he got my information and all that, and told me to wait for a phone call from a registered nurse. So we decided to watch a movie. (I got one from the Library! Pretty weird, though...) And at some point the nurse calls. She asks her questions and blah blah, and I interrupt, because that's what I do. I interrupt everyone, it's a bad habit I need to break. So turns out that I need to go to the Emergency, because who the fuck knows what could happen if it busts or whatever. So I freak out. I don't WANT to go to the Hospital. I don't like it. I don't mind going for other people, but I do not want to go for myself. Boo! I just don't like it. So the girls convince me to go. We call Nancy, see if she can pick us up, since the bus has stopped running at this point. She says she'll be here in a half hour. Meanwhile, I'm trying to get a hold of my parents. Turns out they're in Sudbury. So I call their cell phone, no answer. Call my aunt, she gets my uncles number, call there, no answer. FUCK. I tried their cell phone again, finally worked. Talked to my mom. (which reminds me, I have to call and let them know what's going on..) She told me not to worry and get to the hospital, everything should be fine. So ok. Then Nancy arrives. We get our asses out to meet her, we start driving, got out of the parking lot, her muffler falls off. We pull off across the street, and well.. I figured it was a sign from God saying not to go to the Hospital, so we came home and smoked pot. I still think sex would have helped more, but I can deal with just pot. But yeah, my eyes was gradually getting better. From the time we decided to go to the hospital to the time we went to bed. It was getting better but weird. Oh well. I could and can, still see fine out of it.
It was fucked up, man. Fuuuucked up. But funny. I was all not in such a good mood. I tried to lighten up. I wasn't in a bad mood or anything. I just wasn't happy chipper Nat.
But I do love marijuana. I'll post pictures of my pipe this weekend.
My sister and Kyle are coming over tomorrow!! I'm so excited! Oh man! They're only coming for the night. They're leaving for Ottawa early in the morn.
I'm excited. Anywho, I gotta jet.
Get some stuff done today."

"event","Finally, somethin' positive to write about!  I've nailed down where, when and with who I'll be recording my CD - this January I'll be heading to Mushroom studios with the boys, and Winston on board to produce.  We have a nice tight schedule planned - I don't want this to be one of those projects that drags on and on...I want to get it done! (right!)  I can't wait, I love the band I have, and I'm confident with the songs I've chosen - it'll be good times.

After 5+ weeks, I saw Brendan again for 2 nights, only to have him leave again for another 12 days.  He's been touring Canada with Kent McAlister, and it's been an odd time without him around!  Soon enough they'll be back for good, though.  

I've been living the bar life - workin' late nights and sleeping in as late as possible - which I much prefer, compared to the other extreme.  Unfortunately, it's just barely paying the bills, in a time where I'm still trying to save up.  I'm just so tired of switching jobs though.  (Well, part  of me is.  The other part couldn't care less, and really wants a change of scenery often.)

So anywho, that's things..."

"event","As I come out of a nap in an extremely groggy headachey state...

Everyone keeps saying they don't know how I do it, (work one job till 1 am then get up at 4:45 for the next), but somehow, I'm managing.  (knock on wood).  The occasional naps do help.  And the evening shifts aren't every night, I do get closer to 6 hours sleep from time to time ;O)  But really, it's watching the savings account dedicated to my CD project grow that makes the hard work worth it.  

As a taste-tester for the studio, and also to create an application for good ol' Factor Money, we'll be going in to record a song or two next week.  I'm definately psyched - it will help keep me excited and therefore motivated to keep working my ass off!  And we really need some recordings as a band so I can start trying to book some more gigs.  

With this kind of a schedule, I can't say I'm getting out too much (not that I really did before :O/ 
That is, aside from seeing early shows for a certain movie from a certain series about a certain boy with certain powers....OK IT WAS SO GOOD!!!      just had to get that out.  ahem.

Ok one more, Chris Cornell was amazing too, I got up close and personal in the front row, but decided to get out of there about half way through once I was being squished into a ball the size of my cat.  Bruises were obtained, along with really wicked photos that I'll put up on my flickr soon.

All for now!"

EEeee so tonight's the ""finals"" for the ""vocalist contest"" I'm in.  I had hoped that my cold would be completely gone by now, but a stuffy nose lingers on - I hope I still sound ok.  It'd be great to win the studio time - I want an album!!!

YAY for a hair cut I like!  I'm blonder and bob-ier, and when I left I wasn't sure but after styling it mysef I really like it.  Even though it cost a little more than I planned....so I decided to go with it and also spoil myself with pretty new shirts that were full priced but look so good...(I always buy stuff on sale, or second hand, but income taxes just came back soooo,....)

My silly band is taking soooooo long to come together, I'm a patient person but I'm pissing myself off!  Well, not really, it's my own doing, I want to have good new songs to do with them and that takes some time.  Yay band!

Yay Media Club!  I love being a door-girl.  I was thinking about it while working last night, and I'm so used to watching shows in a corner by myself that I have a ball getting paid to do it!  (OK, I'm exaggerating my patheticness a bit there, but it's true about the getting paid to watch music part). 

Boo office work.  It's soooo boring, and yet at the same time a little part of me enjoys the slight responsibilities, and the feeling of knowing what you're doing within a system and doing it well.

I was in the same emotional state in September, had a plan to change, but fell back into the exact same - state.  I quit my job to pursue things I enjoy, and so far haven't come up with much joy.  I have no idea what's wrong with me.  No matter how hard I try to be positive,  negitivity always wins.   I'm really not sure why I'm writing this in an online journal...too lazy to scribble, I guess.

"event","It's been a while, but I feel like writing.  

It feels great having left my job.  Even though the security of a paycheck might be missed, I in no way regret the decision.  Things are happening for me, one at a time, but they're like little seeds.  I've been given the opportunity to plant them, but whether or not I do that and how well they flurish will be completely up to me.  I need to accept that the universe absolutely will put fate (or whatever you want to call it) on my side from time to time, but  after that, I'm on my own to see it through.  So, I just need to stay focused and remind myself to do a little hard work too, and it will pay off.

Physically, I've been giving myself time to excercise, even if it's just 30 min inside streching and stuff.  I know it's better than nothing!  yesterday something I ate really rocked my system, so I figured now's a good of a time as any to do the cleanse I've been thinking about since I got back  from NY.  I decided to go with the Master Cleanse, wich is basically a liquid diet, the energy coming from a lemonade-type drink.  It seems to have some medical backing, so I thought it would be worth a shot.  There's program kits you can buy, where you take suplements and they outliine a specific meal plan, but I really don't think I'd stick to it.  (and yet somehow I think I'll stick to no food at all....?)  

I'm debating now if I should go to Cortez at this point or not.  The few things holding me back are 
a)wanting to finish charts and meet with piano man John again so he can confirm he wants to do his Lounge act with me, 
b)wanting to confirm with the Extras agency that I'm into it and get my contract back to them, 
c) now I see there's auditions for TUTS, for Grease, with a director that I know from high school, and my instincts and the little performing child inside of me are screaming AUDITION, DUMMY!!! And that's next weekend.  

Maybe I need to put off my trip until I have more time, although I'm afraid that I will only be getting busier from here on out....or maybe just a shorter trip, right in the middle of the week.  I've put a lot of weight on going away, like that's my time to really solidify within myself who I am and what I should be doing with myself.  Can that be accomplished in 5 days?

Grr, I better decide soon...."

I had my first gig in Vancity last Saturday and got invited back for this weekend, except that Diego can't make it.  So I had to scrounge up another guitar player to learn a set of songs in less than a week...Mark to the rescue!  (and sidenote, the reason Diego can't make it is because he'll be on the island for what sounds like a killer birthday party, and I'm choked I can't make it!  Sunday morning work meetings sure are a bummer...)

Also, I got into a women's choir that I auditioned for.  That will keep my Thursday nights busy, and hopefully my technique in check!

Yesterday I shopped all around town for the perfect pair of (affordable) boots, and I'm glad I held out till the end, because that's when I found them!  If you're ever shopping downtown for shoes, hit Spring on Robson first, they have the best prices...

Hmm, on a personal note, should I feel guilty for having romantic dreams involving friends?  It's kind of cool, like exercising the curiousity hormone without actually being unloyal.  Hehe.  But hopefully awkwardness won't be a problem the next time I encounter said person.  Man, kind of get goosebumps thinking about it..."

It was hilarious - full of dancing latinos dancing sexier than I could ever hope to.  Even the older ladies get their groove right on.  Although, with my trusty bottle of wine by my side, I still had a good time, especially in the jam - I held down the shaker like no body's bussiness.

Oh and good stuff, Stef got hired at my work, so she'll be around the store in the next couple of weeks.  At work, I've basically decided to stop taking things so personally - meaning not caring if my ideas are heard or if I agree with the decisions made.

"event","So, yesterday my goal was to scan & upload a bunch of my photos to start a photo journal.  I searched Craigslist, found one for 5$, got on the bus and went.  The guy was really nice and also gave me a few things from India that he was clearing out.  So I was feelin great, then I got it home and realized it's so old I can't even plug it in to the mac-ie (yes that's what I call my computer :O) so I ride my bike arond town to find an adapter, which didn't fit, and then I see it says it's only windows compatable.  Well I guess that's what you get for 5$.  So I didn't exactly accomplish anything. 

Although while on Craigslist I saw an add needing some kind of musical act and I was trying to pimp the bands that I know, then I thought maybe I should throw myself in there too, as an option.  I told Brendan about that and one other potential thing where I'd need a guitarist, and later that night our friend is over and Brendan says he's my new guitar player.  (he sure is trying).  So maybe today I will put together some charts and see if that space is available.  I can hardly avoid it know, B would not be impressed  ;O/

Yesterday night I tagged along to a rehearsal (no, didn't really play along). I should probably try and be social somehow tonight."

"event","To get a little philisophical on your asses...

I realized the root of all of the small details that don't seem to be in place in my life can be traced back to one underlaying fundamental uncertainty - is it all fate?  To elaborate,  is there really a specific path that one is meant to follow?  Because if there is it would seem that every decision, down to the smallest choice, is not actually a matter of choice or free will, but a pre-determined set of actions that will lead you to your final unmistakable destiny.  Now, I simply don't believe that every decision I make is the way ""it was supposed to happen"".  I believe that people fuck up, make bad choices, and miss out on opportunities all the time.  So, if after a number of screw ups, your path must enevitably change, right?    If you go through life not grabbing all the opportunities you can, the outcome would be different than if in all those small seemingly unimportant moments you made a different choice.   I would definately like to believe that we each have some general purpose for being here, but how definate can it really be if our small choices can alter it?  Or Maybe, we simply all just have the potential to fill some kind of purposefull existance, if we suck it up and realize that there might be a greater point to ourselves than living our day to day meaningless lives.  Or, perhaps there's no plan at all, and those who hold on to a dream or positivity or whatever gets them through the mud, and have tons of ambition and work hard, these are the only ones who make it anywhere and seem to have had a grand ""path"" that was greater than their own, which is just an excuse us lazy asses come up with to make ourselves feel better about not accomplishing anything.  If that was their path, then it was meant to be.  It makes sitting on the couch every night seem like less of a waste of life when you put the blame/credit on a higher power who controlls where your life should go.  

So that's sounding kind of synical, and that's funny because I really do try to believe that there is something deeper to life than just a bunch of randomness, but I'm just not convinced that it's completely etched in stone.  There seems to be some kind of energy that some people are able to tap into, that just makes things flow.  It's like a wave,  when you're on you're on and one with the water that created the entire ocean  that raised that one bit of water for you to be a part of.  I suppose you fall off, from time to time, no one can ride it forever, but I guess there's some who are just to scared to even try to get up on their board.  (sorry for the surfing analogy, sounding kinda flaky I know).  But god, it's freaking scarey, if you haven't gotten up to ride in a long time, and you see that wave coming, it can be absolutely terrifying, and much easier to stay laying on that board.  So, here's the point of the rambling, for the writer to come to their own realisation - that's me, on the board, not in touch with the ocean or any of the water around me cuz I'm too damn comfortable staying safe.  Getting up will mean falling at some point, and I'm obviously way to unsure if I'll be able to stand right or balance  to even give it a try.

Anyways, back to the fate part...If you're not sure one way or the other, you end up stuck in nothingness .... If I believed that what will be will be, I would stop trying and worrying and just put my faith in something that it will all work out.  But then I feel lazy.  If I believed that I have to make my own fate, I would be more self assured, make decisions and get things happening.  But then I feel ignorant.   So instead, I'm unsure, and without giving myself over to one way or the other, I end up in a constant state of unrewarding uncertainty."

What I mean by this, is movies that have a really good idea going, something unique or captivating, with little moments that 
make you think certain things, where you're just waiting for the end so you can go OOOHHHHH and put all the pieces together and reflect and say wow, that was good, only to have all those thing lead to an ending that makes you go WHAT?

Why are there so many bad scripts?  even the ones that should be good aren't.

Well, here's another Christmas away from home.  It's not so bad, it kinda sucks to have to make all the food and at the same time not be able to make the food half as good as your expectations are, I feel worse for B because I'm sure he kinda misses the turkey and all that.  But I love being here in a white Christmas, the cold air is actually growing on me!  It's so refreshing and energizing.  Sure, not for long, but still....

I hope we find something decent to do for New Years, that's another event that never can live up to its own expectations.  Most of our good friends will still be out of town at that point.  We'll see....

Ah yes, and the New Year will bring New York!  It's still a touchy subject around here since Brendan decided not to go.  I tried to convince him but the money issue is kinda tight I guess.  But it will be so fun to be there with a dozen other friends, good times good times!  

I've really been struggling with the musical identity thing....(as I have been for like the past 2 years, but anyways...)  I really can't figure out exactly what I want to do.  I mean I know I don't have to put limitations on myself, I could be involved in several projects that exercise different parts of my musical self, but when it comes to my songs even, they're still so fucking eclectic that we still don't sound like a band, we don't have a sound that can be identified with, and I know it's all me.  Lately we've been doing so many rock shows that we've had to really lean in that direction, only playing the fast stuff and playing it hard.  It's fun, but it seems a little put on, as individuals none of us are outgoing showman, and after listening to a live recording, I think I sound like shit when I'm trying to push too hard.   So do I admit defeat and give up the rockstar dreams and tone it down a bit?  I do really want to push forward with the band in the new year, finally try to get something professional together (and a name!  We need a name!).   Hopefully I can see the reality of what direction we should go and just do it, no looking back.  

Joyeux Noel et Bonne Annee mes amis!"

It's nice to be back, although it's almost hard to call it home because it's really not my home right now.  I totally understand the saying home is where the heart is, because even though I love seeing everyone and everything, I feel like I dont really have a purpose here right now...all my energy, responsibilities,  are in Montreal.  

On a sad note, we'd only been here a few days, and we got called to the hospital.  Brendan's grandma had a heart attack and died that evening, but only after all her family had time to get there to see her.  Even though it was an act of fate, there's a definate, *something*, about the fact that it happened in the 10 days Brendan was back in the city, and after the whole family got together for a nice day out together.  The heart knows...

Anyways, it's been a thought provoking time.  I miss my little kitty!  Yah, I'm pretty tired now."

"event","Ok, after a nice, quiet zen-like day, I'm ready to mention what makes me really happy.  

1-Being underwater.  Any body of water would do, all my life I've just been so freakin happy to be in the water.  Indescribable feeling, the suspension and quietness and seclusion from the rest of the world...

2-Eating or Drinking my favorite things.  Yes, it's up there pretty high, I absolutely love pleasing this sense. It seems to be the only sense that serves only for pleasure purposes.  For me, anyways.  

3-Singing.  That may be an obvious, although it's one thing that doesn't ALWAYS bring joy, it depends on the situation.  School + singing can lead to more stress than joy.  I'd say the most elated I've ever felt is singing in choirs, there's something about being part of that collective of sound that feels bigger than yourself.

4-Lastly, being back-tickled by my lover.  If you've never experienced this, I strongly suggest it (by YOUR lover, of coarse, not mine ;O) Just lightly draw on the back with your fingertips, I promise shivers will follow."

Know what I hate?
-the trend for girls to be stupid and bitchy (ahem paris hilton etc).
 There is nothing cool about being a rich arrogant stupid bitch, and the fact  that people are buying into it being cool pisses me off.   When will people value intellegence over sex appeal?

-people who are pushy.  If you ask/tell someone to do something more than once, and they don't want to, shut up and deal with it (ok I need to take this advice sometimes too)

-Venues that are bothered by the fact that I call back to see if they've even listened to my demo. Sure, they get lots, but I'd be stupid not to be agressive with it.



I'll come up with a list of things I DO like soon."

Your birth on the 11th day of the month makes you something of a dreamer and an idealist. 

You work well with people because you know how to use persuasion rather than force. 

There is a strong spiritual side to your nature, and you may have intuitive qualities inherent in your make up, too. 



You are very aware and sensitive, though often temperamental. 

Although you have a good mind and you are very analytical, you may not be comfortable in the business world. 

You are definitely creative and this influence tends to make you more of a dreamer than a doer.</td>

Hmm, interesting.  Do these things always just seem to apply because they mention only one aspect of a personality?  Like if it said all that then said, 'and you have commitment problems and love meat'...then it would be covering more groud and something would have to be wrong.  (lol I guess I think those things are the most opposite of me :O)"

"event","Yay, 
this weekend I had my first show of all originals!  I was opening for another singer/songwriter, and got to do a whole set (which is really all I have right now).  There were enough of my friends to make it feel like a show, but all the people he invited (the other singer) didn't come until my set was done, so I didn't get to expose my music to too many new people.  Although it was the first time my friends have heard my music like that, so it was still cool. 
Me and Brendan were moving last week too, so I didn;t have any internet and totally forgot to post about the up-coming gig for people. *oops!*  But our new place is freakin sweet...our big balcony looks over the outdoor pool, and we have acces to an indoor pool and gym too.  We painted the walls a deep tan and teal, it's so nice lookin.  
So, hopefully more gigs to come soon...I'll remember to give a heads up for the next one..."

  You are a visionary with courage and enthusiasm if a little hasty at times. Your ambitious nature can be satisfied when you apply wisdom, patience and self-discipline to your vitality and zest. You have wonderful way with words and may be drawn to the communications arena where there is the potential for great success. Your generous and warm nature attracts many friends and loved ones.    

 

This one was pretty on the ball, figured I'd copy it to look back on once and a while...""if a little hasty at times...""  Ah yes, the procrastinator (sp?)that is me.

"event","Hmm, I have a serious lack of personal posts lately.  And I kinda feel like rambling at the moment, so who needs another excuse?!

I found a job! Yay!  Although it won't start till next week and I still won't be paid util mid-june, so I'll have to continue to be stingy until then.  
I feel lucky to have gotten the hook-up from a girl from school, and I was thinking about the one night we were all at a mutual friend's house and she mentioned the job.  I really didn't want to go out that night, but if I hadn't I'd still be searching...but fate like that has been not always in my favour lately. It seems everything I've been searching for myself doesn't turn up, and the good news comes from other people's connections (getting a job, getting gigs of my own, blah blah).   

But anyways, I have been trying, and I'm sure it will eventually pay off.  

I just got a hair cut at a trendy place on St Laurent, and I hate it. It looks like a female mullet, and it's soooo thin.   People say it looks fine but I think they could just be being nice.  I'm gonna put it up and wait for it to grow out.  At least it will be cool for the summer (meaning not as hot) (but I won't be as hot either lol).

I need to see more music!  My Jack (Johnson) isn't coming to Montreal and the Toronto tickets are totaly sold out. Serious tears.  Although I will be seeing Bela Fleck in Ottawa soon.  Should be good.

Well, better start being productive soon. Wish me luck."

To be specific, I am looking for maybe some good listings in the city, perhaps beyond the 'telemarketer' ads that fill the papers.  I am very familiar with the performing arts, and it would be fantastic to find ANYthing to do with entertainment.  Places to look?  Is there hope?  ;O)"

I enjoyed the time off, but I realize now I need to get to work and make this move pointfull (that word really should exist).  I have a band somewhat together and enthusiastic, with connections to a studio and gigs appearantly,  I signed up for ""power yoga"" for only 30$ through the school,  and I need to think of a money-making scheme for the  summer.  I say scheme because I figure the amount of money I need to make can only be obtained in such a short amount of time can be nothing short of a scheme.  Cruise ships came to mind, but I really don't want to leave this city once it finaly gets nice.  It hasn't been unbarable, but it's been pretty miserable.  But really I don't mind the snow that much, it's a nice change.

So here we go.
I've gotten deeply re-emersed  with my Smallville roots.   I've began from first season, first episode and am quickly making my way through downloads.  I don't feel all that guilty about TV downloads, they are always free to watch anyways.  Regardless, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna  have a DVD set under my tree this Christmas, the hints have been anything but subtle around here lately.
And believe it or not, Brendan has actually gotten into them.  I'm sure it had nothing to do with showing him the episode where Lana gets sneezed on by the mutated flower and strips down to her skivies in the pool.  No, that had nothing to do with it.

And the bloody cold has begun here...I can officially say I've never experienced these temperatures before in my life, and it's only going to get worse before it gets better.

My Sammy's in Cali, Eh?  Well enjoy the *warm* because relatively, you're in the tropics.  And say hi and a very ""joyeux noel""  to your lovely family!

Yesterday I went to jam with the band who advertised for a singer,  and was pleasently surprised by the type of music they were playing.   It was just jamming on ideas, but they were very laid-back, groovy rock things that I was TOTALLY diggin.  Being myself of course, I didn't sing my ideas nearly loud enough to be audible, but I got a few  things out here and there.  They liked my song (I scribbled out the chords to Motivation) and it seemed to go well.  We'll see.

Speaking of Motivation, I just entered it into the canadian songwriting contest which works by radio stations in most big cities choosing their favorite entry and forwarding that winner to the Canadian finals.  I don't have a mix that I'm 100% happy with, but hey, what can ya do.

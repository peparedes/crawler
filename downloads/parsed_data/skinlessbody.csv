"event","Okay so yeah, have you ever had people just start talking shit and then they're doing exactly the same thing they say they hate? Well anyways, according to some people at school Jamie's new hair color looks too gothic for her.. and I'm evidently rubbing my goth-ness off on Jamie.  Which, for one.. I don't see how Jamie's hair is ""goth"".. and for two, I don't see how I'm goth.. and for the third.. I didn't tell her to dye her hair or dress a certain way and stuff?  It's weird.  Anyways, and then a certain person was all calling her hair ugly... You can ask like 90% of our high school and they'll tell you opposite.. 



Well anyways.. Back to the subject.  So she said Jamie's hair was ugly.... and I mean come on, I think it's hot as hell.  And this person said that, and I quote ""We all grew up and got normal boyfriends"" meaning, unlike Jamie(My girlfriend) they all grew up and got normal boyfriends.  Which is why they party and alla' that shit.  And how am I not normal?  I mean, i didnt know a sophomore dating a 28 year old with a kid was normal... 

and shit, she probably has to get him drunk just for him to lie to her and tell her she's pretty!



Oh and this person is also one who hates ""Two-faced people"" when yet she talks shit behind Jamie's back...



i think there's a case of jealousy up in this bitch.  That and a case of egotistical fat ass whose tits hang to her knees... whilst she thinks she's hot shit, because she's got cock from like 8 different guys in this county.. Again, being two faced, WHILE she was dating ONE guy.



so come on, haha.. maybe her opinion would matter if she wasn't so two-faced and ignorant.  Okay, yeah, hopefully I've made my point.. Oh and this isnt' just about one person.  It's her and her little ""posse"" of followers.. Which is pretty stupid, WHY would you follow a slutty ignorant peice of shit like her... I mean damn.  Go join the army if you want to follow a dumbass peice of shit.



Okay points proved:
Jamie's hair is hot.
""This Person"" is not... but thinks she's hot shit.
Tits that hang to your knees aren't hot.
""This Person"" needs to grow up.
and get a normal life, stop being so egotistical and jealous, and get a grip on reality... and how much everyone else hates her except her brother and her little followers.

Oh and she needs to lose some weight before she thinks shes hot shit, then you'd probably still have to get a guy drunk before they at least THINK she's pretty.

And This Person needs to realize that just because Jamie isnt' shoved up her ass 24/7.. it dosn't make Jamie anti-social.



Which is another thing, How is my girlfriend anti-social?  Personally I've seen her talk to and be friends with alot of people.  I mean how many people are around her locker at break talking to her?  It's not just me ya' blind bitch. 

haha



god.

two faced ignorant egotistical fat asses are so funny.



wooo

look at me

my tits hang to my knees

i'm hot

durr durrrrrrrr



haha enjoy it michael n angela.  i'm sure you'll be the only people to read this until it goes myspace(gotta get jamie's permission to do that.)

I wish things would be okay.
I wish she would believe me
I wish i wasn't going fucking insane.
My eyes are wide open, but I'm dead inside...

"event","I haven't updated this bitch in forever, but I haven't really had the time... yeah I guess it's 'cause I'm a myspace whore.

but the past two days have been so awesome, minus being sick.. and not including the first part of today which I'm still going through and it sucks so far... 
but yeah
Thursday was Jamie's birthday so we picked her up around 10:30 and she came up to my house and we chilled, we made her birthday pizza rolls and had a candle in one... here's a picture of that, it's kinda cool: 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Skinless_Body/PC220019.jpg"">

might be super huge though, it was being a douche on myspace. 

Anyways, after that we just layed in my room, 'cause I haven't been feeling that good at all since Monday.  I've been sick as hell and my medicine isn't working.. so yeah.  Anyways, we layed around and talked, joked around and just chilled until her mom came and picked us up.  We went to her house and as soon as we got there she was begging for her birthday present from her mom.  She got the Family Guy 4th season on DvD.. so naturally we started watching that as soon as she got it.

Ate supper.. all that jazz.
And kept watchin' Family Guy.. duhhhh.
Well, we stayed up watching that and jus tlayin on the couch talking and I got to hold her in my arms until like 1:45 when i couldn't stay awake any longer 'cause my throat was fucking killin' me, and my medicine wasn't working.  So... we just layed there for a little while before I went to bed and I held her in my arms.. and I really didn't want to let go.

So we woke up friday morning, and got ready to go to my house.  We got to my house and went back to sleep.  She slept 'till like 11 and I only made it to like 10:30. So I wake up and come in the living room, and get on the computer for a little while and next thing i know one of our dogs runs in and just starts licking Jamie all over the face.  it was funny, and jamie was just laying there taking it 'cause she was sound asleep. I got a good laugh out of it... She woke up around 11, about ten minutes after the dog licked her face off. 

And we sit on the couch and drank our coffee. After that we layed around again.. what can I say?  I just like to lay there with her in my arms.  It's just one of those feelings you know?  I love her so fucking much, and I never want to let go of her...

Anyways, we had to get up and go to Mick or Mack around 2:30 then go to The Hunters' Den and pick up dad's christmas present, we baught him a new rifle.  So we get home, unload the groceries and then gave dad his christmas present early.  He liked it, well, I'm pretty sure he did 'cause that's all he talked about.. and he's still talking about it now. hahaa. 


So yeah, back to chilling and holding Jamie some more... did I mention I love her?

yeha I think i did.

Anyways.. She left around 4:30 yesterday and even though she didn't go far far away, I've missed her.. I want her back here to hold on my arms.. 

And today I can't
i dont want to get my face near her.
I've got pink eye now, to add to the shit that I've had.
and the shti that i have is getting worse&worse&worse.

and I dont want to get her sicker than she already is.. 'cause she's been sick too.. and no don't think that I got her sick because she was sick before me. .so hah!

anyways, i'm gonna get offa here.  I'm waiting on the antibiotics to get here.. I need to feel better.

Then it's off to pick Jamie up and we're goin to my grandmas for dinner&presents :-D

so yeah.
Later guys, I'll update it more."

"event","So here I am.  Cold as shit and still trying to warm up.  But yeah, it's worth it.. 'cause today has ROCKED.
Anyways, I'm going to start with yesterday.  

So I got up around 7:30 and went riding, I walked up through some thickets and fields and shit trying to jump a deer, but didn't see shit.  So I get back around 10:00-ish.. Talked to Jamie for a minute and then went and helped my Grandma put up a shelf and shit, and carry some stuff up from her basement for the dinner that night.  Around 11:30 I took a shower and washed my dirty ass, got ready and drove down to Jamie's. Her mom cooked us a dinner down there and we ate.. Then around 3 we came back up to my house.  We hung around for a little while and then went to my Grandma's which is like 50 yards away... We ate like hell, and played with my little Cousin's Sam & Cam... They're so fuckin funny! hahaha.  We took Jamie home around 8.. Then I came home, talked to her for a little while and fell asleep around 9. 

So I wake up this morning around 9ish, got up.. got dressed and went hunting.  I saw 4 does on the other side of the creek and I jumped a little buck walking through a thicket.  Came home.. took a shower adn then left to get my haircut.  It looks like shit, blah... 
Went from the haircut straight to Jamie's...
Today's our 7 month... I love her so much!!!!!!

Around 2:30 we went to Pine Top and ate with Stephanie Skipp.. Then went back to Jamie's house.. bullshitted till about 4 and took Steph back to Pine Top.  Went back to Jamie's and I had to leave around 4:30.. Today's been fun as shit, and I got to spend it with my baby.  i love Jamie so fucking much, I don't think any of you can imagine.  

Well... I guess I'll talk to you guys later on... Peeacceee."

well
Theyr'e calling for snow this week, I hope it dosn't snow.. If you don't get out of school CAUSE of the snow.. It takes all the fun out of it.  That and, most importantly, i've been planning on hanging out with Jamie the next couple of days and snow would ruin it.  I really want to see her, 'cause Friday is our seven month. I love my Jamie Lynn Paxton so much. We might go out to eat, too, after I go and get a haircut... Don't worry though, It's not getting cut short.  It'll just be an inch off MAX.

So.
here I am.. a little less than an hour before school starts... I need more sleep, and if I can't get that I need more fucking coffee and more patience.

I get to see Jamie after school... but i'm still blah on the subject of us.. don't ask, it's nothing.

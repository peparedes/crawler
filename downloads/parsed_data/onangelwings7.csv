Content. What a word. Describes exactly how I feel. I'm happy but I'm not as happy as I have been at times in the past. When David comes home then I will be happy. But right now, I'm content with being who I am...and that's a really good feeling. It's also a feeling I haven't had in about a year and a half. I like where my life is going...I've made enough mistakes to balance me out. All I need now is for February 24th to come along and then my life will go by day by day as if it were second by second. I love my truck. It's so me. If you ever see it even if it's your first time you will know it's me. That's exciting. A lot of money went into it but working to pay it off will be the best thing to happen. It feels so nice to finally be at a point in my life where I am excited to wake up in the morning. Thank you god for anwsering my prayers. :)"

"event","So this past weekend I did a lot of stupid shit that I thought I would never do again. And in the process I hurt someone I care about so much. I never thought I could be used. I thought I was smarter then that. I thought I could choose a guy who wouldnt do that to me. On Friday I was on top of the world...right now I feel like the lowest person I have ever been in my life. And it really really hurts. Shit. 

I want David to come home. I want to be with him."

"event","So survived another week of school. Life is starting to get really hectic. Dance Mania, Ten Tones, work, school. It's gonna kill me by xmas and its only gonna start getting worse when competition season roles around. Last night I went to see the movie ""Without a Paddle"" with adam, mark, kate, and david. It was really good, I liked it a lot. It was funny-stupid as I've determined. :) Today I just sat by the pool, waxed the boat, and ran some errands for the parentals. Anybody who is intrested I need to sell my boat to make room for the truck because i can't park it outside anymore because of ""suntree"" rules. It's a Sea Ray jet boat with pink and turquoise stripes. Found out that David isn't coming back to be with me...he's enlisting in the army up in SC... :( Really upseting. My fostgate P2's and punch amp are on order! :) :) :) they should be in by late september. good stuff! Nothing much else to say. Hugs and Kisses."

"event","So on Friday Jon Arellano brought me an apple croissant for breakfast! :) He woke me up and saw me allicky looking but who cares its jon. He told me Rachelle was going to pick me up and her, me, him, and jane were going to go see Liscum and then head down to Stuart! Stuart is where Rachelle now lives a little past Prt. St. Lucie. So we went to go see Liscum because it was Rachelle's last time seeing him. Nothing big just chilled out in his office. We then went to Panera so Jon could get us the discount so lunch would be cheap. When we got to Stuart we watched the 6th season of friends and then Night at the Roxbury. Then I broke the old school DVD... :( so we couldn't watch that either. Then we went to sleep which I miraculously ended up sleeping on the floor...not a big deal. We drove back today because I had to get back for Dance Mania costume fittings at 1pm. After that Kayl and I went to see The Village...SO STUPID! I mean it was weird and it was okay but I mean just plain stupid. After that her and I went to the mall to get her some notebooks for school and then she took me home. I helped dad weed out in the front a little and then we decided to go out to dinner. I was trying to get ready and I got so depressed because my hair looks really really bad. It is sooo blonde and the bangs look so stupid! :( :( :( Sad because it looked really prettty before and then I had to FUCK IT UP! No longer looking forward to school. Mom and I might just dye it back a light brown and go from there with highlights. oh well... leaving for dinner. LOVE YOU!"

That you toss and turn from side to side
That it's my face you've been seeing
In your dreams at night

Tell me that you wake up crying
And you're not sure exactly why
Tell me that something is missing
In your life, in your life baby

[Chorus]
Tell me that you live for love
That forever is never enough
That you've waited all your life to see
That you want so badly to believe
Tell me that it's not just me

I could have sworn I saw you smile at me
Standing in the poring rain
At a loss for words and running out of time
I said this crazy thing (crazy thing), I said

Hold me now and tell me that you do believe
In a soul, a soul mate
And tell me, and tell me, tell me

It's been a really good day; Mike and I went to Cracker Barrel with Kayleigh and Jeff this morning. They calmed me down about the audition I had tonight at Dance Mania...which helped a lot I love you guys! Then all I did till my tryout was run my triple, my fortes, my allusicones, my switch leaps...i haven't danced for quite awhile. Then I went and it went really well! I can't wait! After the tryout I came home and Mike took me to Walmart hahaha he said it was a ""celebration"" and he needed school supplies. Haha. Couldn't have thought of a better way to celebrate myself.

"event","I finally did it. I said goodbye to my past. I put it all in a box and I burned it because all my past consisted of was material things that I thought mattered to me. It was quite the bonfire as you can imagine. I cleaned out my room, vaccumed, shampooed the carpet, and made a big poster the i will see every morning as I wake up... ""Live everyday as if it's your last..because one of these days it will be."" I dated someone who made me realize it isn't always gonna be all about me leading to my internal reason for breaking up with him. It's good that we aren't together anymore because as much as I have learned that it's not all about me I have learned that you can't make anybody else happy until you are happy with yourself and your life. Jumping into a relationship with someone isn't going to make your life any better in the long run...it will actually make it worse. So I've said goodbye to the part of me that thought I always needed a man to make me happy. And I'm 15! I'm barely going to remember any of my ""relationships"" that I had when I get to college. My mom and my dad came from very poor families to where they are now and they have all the right virtues. I want to be like that. I don't want to have it easy. I'm sick of it. My dad bought me my car. That was an incredible gift! All I want to do now is help him with everything. I'll clean the house, I'll make him dinner, I'll help him outside, I want to pay my insurance, my gas, and for my system. I don't need too because ofcourse my parents have money but like I said...I don't want it easy! Everyone says have fun when you're a kid, you don't need to be worrying about all of this now. Well all those people in my eyes are wrong. If I just had my parents pay for my car, for my gas, and for my insurance and I sit on my lazy ass at home instead of getting a job and paying for it then to me that puts me in an even worse position. That guy, I loved him more than I have ever loved anybody else...I need to put that love into something that is a lot more steady than a relationship at 15. Like my grades, saving my money, not going out to the mall and blowing $100 of my parents money, my extracurriculars, and loving my family and friends...who will ALWAYS be there for me. A lot of people don't need to agree with me or even care for that matter I just wanted to state my opinion and show a certain someone how much they made a difference in my life and then to show somebody else that I'm not a spoiled bitch anymore...everything is going to change. And I can't wait."

Those are pictures that me and my friend Jon took at this free booth at Warped Tour...they were quite exciting. The concert was really great, best part was walking around and getting free stuff since it was incredibly hot. Story of the Year and New Found Glory were my favorite. We missed anti-flag because we didnt know it started at 10AM... :( I got my phone ""punked out"" at the samsung tent and paid $4 for a bottle of water. We saw Jane, Clint, Kiah, Josh, Jon V., Lynn, and I went with Jon, Kate and David. ROBBIE was RETARDED and couldn't find ME...gosh darnit. Oh well...nothing else happened yesterday. Gonna try to get to Pleasure Island tonight with Adam but ofcourse my mom is gone so I don't know if my dad will take me. Sick of her not being here...sick of my father being here...can't do anything about it anyways."

Then there is a flat LCD Screen in the shower. It's insane. Quite exciting. David leaves tommorow... :( I saw him yesterday but not as long as I wanted. Double :( He was always there throughout the whole stupid Jon drama. I just wanted to tell you how much I'm gonna miss you. Love You! So yeah I get to go to Robert DeNiro's Sushi restaurant tonight! $30 for a Rainbow roll! YUMMY! I have to get all dressed up! Yay! Going to go workout! Talk to you later! Wivia! Muah!"

"event","So I just got home from Chicago...I feel like the airplane is my new home, something like what my mom feels like only hers is ten times worse. I leave for Miami tommorow...Will I ever be home? No. I love Chicago! I think everyone needs to understand what a great city it truly is. It's clean, it has a beautiful skyline city, it has a beach, it has mass transportation, it has Wrigley Field, it has the best food in America...all around the best city in America to me. It made me in such a good mood! Just what I needed to get away from all the drama. I talked to David every night for about an hour...He is still leaving me :( and I didn't realize how much I am gonna miss him. It's almost as if me and him are an example of opposites attract. His leaving is good in two ways; one- he will get a car when he comes back, and two- I can focus a lot more on school so I can get a good head start. My father has been all over me about my final grades...it was a 3.7 so I don't qualify for the highest bright futures...BIG WHIPTTY DO! He actually just might have to dish out a little of his retirement for me to go to school. Our flights got delayed today and it was a real pain in the ass. I still had first class but not that big of a deal on hour flights and were delayed for like 3 hours. Off to Miami tommorow with Mother, thank god after that i have a week and then Erica and I might go down to Key West or something for our ""Annual Trip""...exciting stuff. Kay well I can't wait for my summer to begin with all my friends when I get back on the 10th. Call Me! I love you!"

"event","So I'm in Idaho at my grandmother's house. The town she lives in, Ashton, is a square mile. No joke or exaggeration...it's incredible. I like to come here to get away...or at least thats what i thought was gonna happen. The exact opposite. All I do here is think...think about all my mistakes, everything thats happening at home, trying to think of solutions to problems that are unsolvable. Flying into the little airport was so amazing because we were so high up that you could look outside and feel like you were in the stars because the sky here is so clear about 5 times better then in Melbourne. It made me think of Jon...how me and him used to just be content with staring at the stars with eachother. It's so stupid...dreaming of something that will never happen again. Sigh..."

"event","So here goes the very long journal about Kate and I's Excellent European Adventure...

May 28th, 2004 Plane Ride / May 29th, 2004 Venice, Italy

Kate and I leave for Europe. We both get to sit in first class! The chairs are fun to play with and we get our own television! :P We got fed really fancy food and watched ""Monster"". That movie makes me never want to commit a sin again! We couldn't sleep at all until our 2nd flight from London to Venice. We ate and then passed out. When we got to Venice we got in a taxi and went to the ship! Boy is it big! We didn't have a lot of time to get situated into our room since we had to get out and use the 4 hours we had to see Venice. I felt like I was in the movie The Italian Job. We stood in the middle of St. Mark's square with all the pigeons, saw a gorgeous church made of tiny gold squares, and walked around all the little shops. We sadly didn't have time to take a ride in a gondola. :( We came back to the ship and passed out until dinner time. After dinner Kate and I went to the teen club and were sadly disappointed so we went up to the real club and met two pretty cool guys Chris and Kyle. Danced with them for awhile then went back down to the room. We got a little homesick so we stayed up all night long talking. We finally went to bed at 7AM.

May 30th, 2004 Day at Sea

So Kate and I didn't wake up till around 4pm from our ""all nighter"" Walked around exploring the ship and got ready for dinner time. It was a formal night so we got all dressed up and got a couple pictures taken. We had an 8pm dinner and got done around 10pm. We went and saw one of the ship's broadway style shows called ""Da Beat"" It was actually quite exciting. We met up with Kyle after and went up to the club. We met two other guys Ben and another Chris. We decided to name Chris, Vamps, (because he had vampire teeth) so we could tell the difference between the two Chris'.We stayed up in the real club till about 3am and then went to the buffet and went in the Jacuzzi till about 5:45am. It was exciting...two ""all nighters"" in a row. We decided we were never going to get our body clocks right so we formulated a plan of Sleeping, Eating, then Clubbing for the rest of our cruise.

May 31st, 2004 Day at Sea

So Kate and I once again slept till 1pm and then went up to sit on the deck with my parents. We found Vamps and went to the Internet Cafe but found that it was down because we were at sea and they couldn't find a signal. So we hung out in our room till ofcourse dinner came around. We then went and found Vamps and Ben in Shooter's having a cigar. Kate and I decided to go change for the club and that we'd meet them up there at Midnight. We found Kyle up there also. The club was really boring and dead that night so we went to the buffet and then all of us went to hang out in our cabin. They all stayed till about 3am and then left because we all had to get up early the next morning to go see Turkey!
June 1st, 2004 Kusadasi, Turkey 

Kate got sick sick and couldn't get off the ship today...:( I felt so bad about leaving her but I promised her I'd come back after we went shopping and see if she felt better to come to Ephesus with us. I've never had so much fun shopping before. Every price is up for bargaining. It's awesome! My mom got a $2500 Necklace for $750 and I got a $550 ring for $125. It was sooo awesome! The funniest part was a guy came up to my mom and said ""How many camels do you want for your daughter? My offer is 500!"" I ran very far away hahaha. Then later on came 1,000 camels then 3,000 camels, then 5,000 camels and 5 jewelry stores. I swear my mother would have sold me if she got offered 7 jewelry stores. My god! They had so many knock off purses in Turkey. They don't have the law that a little something has to be different and that it could be the exact same. I'm not into those LV bags at all but my mom got a Burberry one. After shopping I went back to the boat to see if Kate wanted to come see the ruins but no luck she still felt terrible. So my parents and I went to see the Ephesus ruins together. I felt exactly like I was in the movie Troy...I was running around the ruins yelling ""Brad where are you?!"" The best part was when we were about to start walking through the ruins an English tour guide person asked if we wanted to take a tour with him and we said No that we had a book and that we would be fine. He replied, ""Well you know you are going to look at the rocks and the rocks are going to look at you."" As my dad replied, ""Thank goodness because that's exactly what I wanted to happen, god forbid they start talking to me!"" Haha. At least my dad is happy when we're on vacation. So we came back to the ship and started getting ready for dinner around 6pm. Kate felt good enough to come to dinner and then we went to see this guy sing a bunch of cover songs...How exciting. We went to the club for a while but then came back to sleep around 2am...early night for us. 

June 2nd, 2004 Athens, Greece

Toga! Toga! Toga! Hahaha. Today was such a long day...We walked probably about 7 miles without exageration. We came off the ship and walked to the Metro station...took about a 3 minute ride to a street that was about a mile from the Acropolis. After the long walk we got to the bottom of the Acropolis and I swear when you looked up at it it looked like it was part of heaven and that the gods really did live there. We had to walk up 70m of mountain to get to the top. We took many pictures and saw lots of old rocks. We saw Chris who was on a tour so we couldn't hang out with him. After walking back down we went to a very expensive part of town to have lunch. We walked into an authentic restaurant to have lunch. I was craving a greek salad since I was in greece so I ordered one. HA! What a laugh. What came out as a ""greek salad"" were raw vegetables with no dressing except oil. Ofcourse, I ate it with no complaints but wasn't really what I was after. Haha. After lunch we walked around looking at store for about 30 minutes and then started looking for another metro station to take us back to the ship. After 15 minutes of looking we found one, took it back to the boat, then Kate and I yet again slept until dinner. We had dinner with a greek salad that I was after and went back to our room. Tonight up in the disco they had Toga night! Everyone had to put their bed sheets on like a toga. It was so exciting lol. After 2 hours in the club Ben, Chris, and Kate and I went to Ben's room for awhile and then to the buffet. At about 4am we retired to our room to sleep. 

June 3rd, 2004 Day At Sea

I woke up around 11:30am this morning and went and worked out for about 2 hours...it was quite exciting. Then I came back and took a shower. It was about 4pm when Kate woke up and it was another formal night and we wanted to take a lot of pictures so we walked around for about 45 minutes then came back and started getting ready for an early dinner of 7:30. We wanted to make the 8:45 Broadway show on the ship and we were suppose to meet Kyle and Chris and Ada for the show at 8:30. Well dinner was running late so we tried to find Chris and Kyle and Ada but we didn't see any of them so we ate the rest of dinner and then took more pictures, changed, and watched the 10:45 show. we stayed up in the club till around 3:30am when they shut it down and came back to sleep. Our plan of Sleep, Eat, and Club was working out perfect

June 4th, 2004 Naples/ Capri/Sorento/Pompeii, Italy

Today was my favorite day yet! Even though I got totally sick this morning lol. We met some friends of ours that we made at dinner at the port this morning at about 8:00 after a 7:30 breakfast...I had frosted flakes. Haha that is an important fact of the day. We walked about 2 blocks to the hydrofoil station to go to the beautiful island of Capri. For those of you who don't know what a hydrofoil is, it is a motorboat designed so that it skims the water at high speeds, thus making the ride a very up and down kind of experience. Livia and Kate found out that it isn't good to eat frosted flakes and then ride one of these hydroplanes because you WILL get sick. So after using the restroom and getting off the hydrofoil we walked around the little town of Capri. What a GORGEOUS place! All the beautiful people ofcourse live here. We took cable cars to the top of the mountain to see an amazing view of the Messina Straits. Kate and I decided we will take monthly visits here when we move to Barcelona. At about 11:30 we left to take another hydrofoil to Sorento which is another lovely city not to far away. We had the most delicious meal I have ever had there. Kate had a mushroom and sausage pizza and I had Gnocchi. YUMMY! God I would gain probably a 12987394287498231 pounds if I lived here. From Sorento we took the train to Pompeii which is a city of ruins that back in 79 AD was completely rained over with lava and ash killing all forms of life in its path. It is so amazing to see the buildings that were excavated that still have detail on the walls of paintings. The funniest thing Kate and I saw was the ""Whore House"". WHAT A SIGHT! They had a bunch of rooms with stone beds in them and on the walls a sort of ""Menu"" we called it which was different photos of different positions and different deeds that could be done. Hahaha. It was the best. The club was sooo awesome tonight although Livia almost got raped...seriously...but we won't go into that. We stayed up till at least 4:30am which is really bad because tommorow is going to be the longest day of all....

June 5th, 2004 Civitavecchia/ Rome, Italy

So today was really lonnnng. Saw so many more OLD ROCKS. It was really cold too. Since we stayed up so late I was sleeping everywhere I could. The first thing we had to do was take an hour long bus ride to get to Rome...then we stood in a 45 minute long line to get into the Vadikin which was worth it. I got to see the ceiling to the Sistine Chapel which wasn't as big of a hype and I thought but still worthwhile to see, and then I saw a bunch of dead priests in a basement and around other things. Not as cool as the ""Whore House"" but I mean what you see is what you get. After that we shopped a little and got some Gelado which is really yummy Italian ice cream! :) The best part of the day was walking through the little town of Civitavecchia and Kate and I found real leather 4 Row Studded belts...They're awesome! So after this hefty day of walking through the most ""ancient city in the world"" we got to eat the most delicious 27 course Italian dinner at Sabatini's! It was soooo good. After we stayed up in the club till about 3 with a bunch of new people we met the other night; Natalie, Matt, Corey, Ada, Australian Dude, the Ohio dudes....I'm really bad with names...Eeek! 

June 6th, 2004 Livorno/ Florence/ Pisa, Italy

So today we took a lot of trains. Like real trains on train tracks it was exciting! We first took one from Naples to Florence...Kate and I slept the whole way except for the part when the train guy person wanted my tickets and had to wake me up and hes like Madaam! Madaam! Wake Up!"" quite annoying actually...but then went right back to sleep. In Florence we went to the main square where they had a remake of the statue of David...we were with the friends we met at dinner again. We had lunch in the main square also...SO YUMMY! The best part were the Diet Coke Fishbowls! They had asked my dad if we wanted regular or large diet cokes and he thought what the hell get the large...there had to be at least 50 oz. of diet coke in each one. it was sooo exciting lol. I wasn't really feeling well so I ate a slice of Kate's pizza and was done. We walked along the cobblestone road to the very first bridge built within a city. Really beautiful, then I saw the most GORGEOUS dress in a store that was definetly an Italian designer...since it was Sunday they weren't open and my dad saved about $1,000 because I couldn't buy it...It was that gorgeous...it looked like something Charlize Theron would wear to the Oscars. Had some more Gelado and walked back to the train station to go to Pisa. That's where I started to feel really sick...I was so bummed because I didn't feel good enough to walk up the Tower of Pisa...now I probably will never get the thrill of doing that :( I didn't even get to take one of those pictures that all the chinese people were taking that you put your hands up to look like you are holding up the tower from falling on you...such a disappointment. I felt like I was gonna die when we got to the ship so I took a really really hot shower took 4 Motrins and passed out until ofcourse...Dinner! It was sooooo Escargot night so I knew I had to get better...I had two plates full of them and then I found out something I'M ALLERGIC TO SNAILS! Such another disappointment. Tonight was Rock N' Roll Night up in the club but my sickness came back so I went down to the room and Kate stayed up there till about 3am and came back and got me and we went to the hot tub and stayed out till about 5am. Tommorow isn't gonna be that bad.

June 7th, 2004 Monte Carlo, Monaco

This is such the town for the beautiful people! Oh My God! Kate and I saw sooooo many nice cars; Ferraris, SLR Maclarins, Vipers, Bentleys...lets just put it as if you <didn't have a Benz you shouldn't be there...even Lexus' are looked down on! Aghhh! So we went to a private beach that was made of not sand but....pebbles! The beach were little rocks...Pretty cool if you don't want to get it all stuck to you but it hurts! So I put sunscreen on my back and passed out for 2 hours till my mom woke me up saying ""You're gonna get burnt if you don't turn over...haha. So after that we walked around and went into really fancy malls....I ofcourse was in my bathing suit and shorts and felt very much like i had a disney hat and sunscreen on my nose but yeah it was a lot of fun...Since I had soaked up so much sun I had become dillusional and started planning out my life in Monte Carlo...I would come marry a very very very very rich french man, drive a bentley like J.Lo have my Pink hummer that I always wanted, we would have a huge yacht, a condo right on the beach, and I would have 3 pocket pomeranians; The daddy, FuFu...the mommy, FiFi... and the little boy, FuFi...And if i really wanted a little girl she would be FiFu...Eeek! So exciting! Tonight was LOBSTER night at dinner! All the lobster tails you could eat! Eeee! I had 4 lol. After that we saw the most awesome show called ""Dance!"" It had so many cool things in it, I wish I could do some of the lifts they did in Ten Tones but I'm not as talented. Then it was ALL NIGHT DANCE PARTY and really the last night on the ship because we were all going to a club in Barcelona that night. So we stayed up in the club for a lonnnnng time! It was much much fun. Hehehehe.

June 8th, 2004 Barcelona, Spain

It was the last day of the cruise, we had to get off the ship tommorrow! :( :( :( :( :( Kate and I spent the entire day sleeping because we had stayed up all night and we had 4 more days in Barcelona. The farewell dinner was really yummy...and it was really sad, the last night of being served Chilled soups. It was also sad because we lost everyone and ended up staying on the ship with Vamps and Ben the last night...which I thought was a lot better because it was our last night of seeing them and they were our favorite people and it was just like chilling in the ship that we loved sooo much...we ate a lot and made so many inside jokes...it was awesome. Best night

June 9th, 2004 Barcelona, Spain

Kate and I cried as we drove away from the ship :( It went by sooo incredibly fast, we had met sooo many awesome people, clubbed every night, ate the best food ever and saw a lot of old rocks. The best vacation yet! We still have 6 more days so we weren't hysterically crying. We got to the hotel and what a beautiful, modern place it was! We got a suite with a $3,000 stereo in Kate and I's part of the suite. It was quite spiffy. And you know how in hotels they usually give you shampoo, conditioner, and a bar of soap...this one gave you those, shower gel, bath salts, toothbrushes with toothpastes, shaving kits, shoe mits, sewing kits, and all this other shit...I was all over it! So all of us took a nap for about 2 hours and then we got up and walked to the metro station...one thing I love about Europe...there is mass transportation EVERYWHERE! It's awesome. So we took the metro down to Las Ramblas, which is a shopping/clubbing part of town and I spent lots of $$$ and Kate did too...hehehe. You only live once! I didn't really buy anything for me while I was on the ship so I had to make up for it. After that we were still pretty tired so we walked back to the hotel and chillaxed till dinner which we just went down to the mall and at a restaurant at the bottom. The food here is sooo good no matter where you go...its awesome. Ben called and wanted to go to a club but we made plans for tommorrow night! Yay!

June 10th, 2004 Barcelona, Spain

I LOVE BARCELONA! I am so living here for 5 years after college, no wonder my aunt never wanted to leave! It's soooo beautiful. We started off the day by going to the Cathedral...it was upsetting because they had a bunch of construction going on so you couldn't see its beauty :( So we took Cable Cars up to the top of a mountain to see the old fort...You could see the harbor and you could see our gorgeous ship being bombarded by new cruisers who were going to be in OUR club that night...yet again we cried. From there we went to the Forum which is this Peace thing they hold like ever five years in a different city around the world with exhibition sites and fun stuff...we <didn't really go in but we went to the mall they had built just because of the Forum...They had my favorite store in the world there H&M...my daddy found it about 5 years ago when they only had two stores; one in London and one in Paris...They have the best clothes with the best deals...its awesome! I love it! They just opened one in Chicago and boy i cant wait to max out my credit card on school clothes EEEEK! back to europe...After shopping we ate and I got to order everything in Spanish! Felt very proud of my two years in Spanish...and then we went back to the hotel and they had a grand opening of Starbucks...FREE STARBUCKS! Anything you wanted in the store was FREE! It rocked my socks! So to end the perfect day was the perfect night...Mexican food! and partying. My dad took Kate and I, Ben and his sister to the number one club in Barcelona, Danzatoria...its this 5 story renevated mansion turned into a club...when we got there they told us that it was a private party for a movie premier...my dad did some bullshitting and he got all 5 of us, underage and all into the club! WHAT A BLAST! I felt like the most beautiful person alive! It was the best day of my entire year! It was soooo awesome. I LOVE BARCELONA

June 11th, 2004 Barcelona, Spain

Today we went to the beach just to relax on our last day in Barcelona. There are sooo many topless women over in Europe it's disgusting I felt like I was in a Grease Porno or something...Ewww. I am so glad I am american when it comes to that. We went back to the mall and ofcourse I got more stuff but its all good...shopaholic over here. It was an easy day today because we had a long ass day ahead of us...So we went back and packed all of our stuff so we didn't have to mess around with it in the morning at lovely 6AM.

June 12th, 2004 Barcelona, Spain/ London, England

This morning was freaking HELL! OH MY GOD! MY DAD IS ONE INSANE MOFO! He made us carry all of our 14 pieces of luggage through both airports through the underground up god only knows how many fucking STAIRS oh my god I thought we were all going to die! and then we had to fucking WALK to our hotel...WITH OUR LUGGAGE! People looked at us like we had 5 heads! So after that we needed to take a nap because we did all that and had like 3 hours of sleep and a long flight...So then we went to Leicester Square to get half priced broadway tickets...we ended up seeing some ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" it wasn't actually that bad but I wanted to see Fame so badly even though I had already seen it...it was the best. So then I had to have a Crepe. Crepes are like pancakes with stuff inside them...You cant have them anywhere else but this one vender right by Big Ben right before you go over the Westminister Bridge...they are the best thing you have ever tasted...I usually get butter and sugar...yummy yummy yummy! After the Crepe we went back to the hotel, took yet another nap, got up and got ready and went to the play... then we got to have dinner at the VERY FIRST Hard Rock Cafe! It was soooo awesome! We saw so many awesome things that they had displayed...the perfect ending to a perfect trip...

June 13th, 2004 London, England/ Melbouring, FL

Plane Ride home was gay and long. 

YAY SO THATS THE TRIP! IT ROCKED OUR SOCKS! IT WAS THE BEST EVER! NEXT SPRING BREAK WE'RE GOING TO BRAZIL! CAN'T WAIT! ROCK N' ROLL! DRIVE SAFELY! YAY!"

"event","Today was exciting! Worth Updating for! Kate and I went to Orlando at around 12 to finish shopping for the cruise...which is in 2 Days!! When we got there all these freaky guys were staring at us and made us feel really uncomfy and then these mexicans drove up in their rice burner and were honking...I hate rude guys like that...! She got some really cute outfits that yours trully picked out at Forever 21. She looks so pretty with her new hair color that I did on her. Then we went to Charlotte Russe and I got a dress thats really short and looks like one of those french maid whore outfits...Exciting! After that we headed to Sephora which I swear is the best store ever. We had to take my grandma to the airport also so we left around 4:00. We came home after that and then the best part of the day came! we decided to go see the movie ""Troy"" at the Oaks with the ""Davids""...almost exactly like old times. I hadn't seen David R. in a long time because he moved away without saying goodbye! :( lol but I forgave him. He looks different now but still ofcourse really cute! ;) I'm glad he came because he made the movie 3 times more fun then it would have been with anybody else. Old times just might come around again...Going over to Kate's tommorow for the Bon Voyage party! Can't wait! Post tommorow...Promise! Love You Guys!"

"event","Today was the last day of school...nothing exciting. Went in late just to go to the Ten Tones Party. I'm still really excited I made it again for next year. One more week before Kate and I leave for Europe. Exciting Exciting! Came home, got into an argument with the infamous Jon, talked to David R. for the first time since he left without saying goodbye, and went to the beach for the beach party at Coconuts. Saw a couple people I knew from Cocoa Beach, how exciting. Nothing too much better to write."

"event","Whoever made Bubblicious gum is genius...my random thought of the day. Today was pretty boring. Ran errands with mom; got my AP Summer Reading Books, got candy, went to the mall...normal stuff. I also decided that it is time for me to get boob implants because I tried the cutest dress on in the mall today and it didnt look right because I couldn't wear a braw with it and my boobs were too small. I don't mean like the kind of boobs that Pamela Anderson wanna-be on MTV got I just want some 38C's...those could be nice. It could also help me in the bathing suit department.
   I think I find out tommorow if I made Ten Tones or not...aghhh. Scary! I rocked my dance audition but my singing audition was terrible. I wish I had had the right music to go with my voice. Shit! That's really embarrassing to go down from Ten Tones to Women's Show Choir but Oh well...if only he had call backs...I'm gonna hit myself everyday over summer if I don't make it. That's gonna suck.
   I have to start studying for finals right now..."

"event","All my friends that are seniors graduated tonight. I can't stop thinking about how much things are going to change once I graduate. No more school shopping in the fall, no more getting lockers next to your friends, or even worrying about what spot is going to be yours in the lunch room. A lot of things are going to change and if you know me well enough you know I hate change. That's why I stayed with Jon for so long. My life is pretty much based upon routines. I hate that. Life shouldn't be lived like that. It's boring like that. 
   KT and I found out last night that we are going to Europe together. A 12 Day Cruise, 5 Days in Barcelona, and 2 Days in London. While we are in Barcelona I really wish we could meet up with Kathleen. I miss her a lot. She was my very first friend at HTA. We walked to Pre-Algebra togheter the first day of 7th grade. She's a real person with no superficiality. I wish I and so many more people could be more like that."

"event","It seems that every time I come back here, I wind up having to change up my journal cuz the layout and style I had when I left is always out of date. =P
For the most part when I want to post a journal entry, I just post on my DeviantArt journal. lol =P

I'm kinda sad that I almost never post anything to my LiveJournal.
Problem is I never know what to talk about in these things. =/
I also have a blog on BlogSpot, but I only have like two entries in it. D=
Just about everything I want to talk about pertains to my art, and so I pretty much cover all that in my DeviantArt journal.
I almost never have anything to talk about besides that. =/

Although going by the lack of comments on all my previous entries, it doesn't look like it really matters. lol XD"

That was like a year and a half ago! O_o
And now that I'm finally finished with it, I find myself incredibly bored.

Bored enough to come to my long-neglected LiveJournal and spruce it up a bit.

Boy did it need updating!"

It's a lot easier to gt an LJ than a DJ. No stupid serial-number-ish codes to retrieve from friends and junk.
The bummer, though is that I was forced to use a password I'll probably never remember, because the password I normally use for everything has letters that repeat too close together, and LJ didn't like that.
Other than that, I'd say it's about the same as DJ, accept it's Live instead of Dead... I'm tired. I think I'll shut up now..
I guess this'll be it until I can do more with it."

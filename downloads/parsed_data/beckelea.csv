"event","I'm SOOOO TIRED from the long week, and my first class is 8am! SUCKS. Oh well. I just took about an hour long nap, should probably head back to the house to finish cleaning my room/hanging up pictures and do a load or two of laundry if everyone else isn't trying to do theirs! We only have one washer in the house - again, SUCKS. So I really should get off my booty and go get something done, eh? Lots to do tomorrow too, fun fun.
AHHHH!!!!
As soon as next weekend is over, then the football game on Thursday night, then, maybe then I'll get a break.
Funny, all I wanted to do was be busy again and now its a little too much, especially for my recovery. I'm surprised I've been able to make it this far. Watch out though, one day I might just collapse in the middle of everything.
Maybe I miss your loving, maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit. Maybe I miss your body lying right next to mine, maybe I miss your touch; a little too much."

"event","In the middle of spirit week - fun fun! Actually, it hasn't been bad at all. The few times that I am supposed to be 3 places at once (RA training, guard camp, and sorority stuff) isn't all that fun, but otherwise, its going well. Got another meeting now, so I guess I better go. Chandra got engaged this evening!! Ryan proposed in front of at least half the house, it was so sweet! Congrats to her, happy birthday to little Laura, and hugs to Courtney. Spirit week does make you closer to your sisters!"

"event","Back in Tulsa. Glad to be back, but its sooo hot! Nate's currently cooking me chicken and spaghetti!! I'm rooming with Bridget for another 2 nights, perhaps I'll actually sleep there tonight. heh We rented a movie yesterday, but then I ended up talking to my mom for almost 45 minutes during the movie and then Virginia called and wanted to go to Smitty's with me, so I ditched Bridget and Katy (I hope they didn't mind) and went out for about an hour before Nate got off early. It was fun. My first experience in a bar...I'm so innocent O:-) 
Thats about it. I'll let Somelea fill you in on any trips she might be taking at the end of this weekend. Yey for moving in to my room tomorrow afternoon. My car is SO FULL!

"event","So I got back to NM this morning around 10am, took a shower, grabbed food with my mom then went to my grandpas. Talked to him for a bit before going out to run errands with my mom, aunt, and cousin. My mom and I are running on about 4-5 hours of restless sleep from driving all night - we're quite irritable. So we get home around 3:30, exhausted, rest of half an hour then my mom took off to visit her parents. Nate flies in tomorrow morning (7:30am!) and we've already got most of the day planned visiting people - sigh! And nothing in this room is packed - oh, except the suitcase that I just brought here! AHHHH!!!! I'm so GROUCHY! 

And this ridiculously fat and lazy woman (I'm sorry, but its true. I don't discriminate unless you're lazy and dumb like this person must have been) waited in the middle of the parking lot aisle at Wal-mart for a good 5-10 minutes (no, REALLY) with us behind her just wanting to leave, because she wanted a parking spot in the second row. We had to wait for a really old man to load groceries in his trunk, put his cart away, walk back to the car, get in, and pull away before she could pull in and park her car and get out of our way. I jokingly suggested to my highly irritated mother driving the car that she should bump this lady and she really almost ran my car into her huge truck. GRR. 
We were angry, we'll put it that way.

Anyway, back to packing. 

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

I'm REALLY TIRED AND GROUCHEY!"

"event","1.When you look at yourself in the mirror, what's the first thing you look at?
funny, I've never noticed - eyes?

2.How much cash do you have on you?

Rest

4.Favorite plants?
For me, ones that are hard to kill

5. Who is the 4th person on your missed call list on your cell phone?
I don't have a missed calls list, only a recent received calls list AND it keeps the last 10 people, not calls, so although Nathan has been my last 4 calls, he only counts as the top one, which actually bothers me, I wish I could keep track of my calls more, but whatever...my fourth most recent received call was my brother when he was at the airport ready for us to pick him up

6.What is your main ring tone on your phone?
Classic ring for people who don't have their own special ring, however anyone who calls often has their own ring, so I hardly ever hear the regular ring - kinda nifty

7.What shirt are you currently wearing?
A tie-dyed Taylor Mustangs t-shirt!! Give me a break, I didn't bring but a weeks worth of clothes home, didn't expect to be here 3 weeks 

8.Do you ""label"" yourself?
eh, I try not to...limits yourself

9.Name brand of your shoes currently wearing?
Well I'm not wearing any but the last ones I had on were Arizona Jeans brand...funny, they were shoes :o)

10.Bright or Dark Room?
bright please

11.What do you think about the person who took this survey before you?
I like her :o)

In more than one sense of the phrase...

I think that was about the time I fell asleep on my phone

14.What did your last text message you received on your cell phone say?
Goodluck Darling! Love you! (I love my Somelea too!!!)

15.Do you ever click on ""Pop Ups"" or Banners?
Not on purpose

16.What's a saying that you say a lot?
Good-NESS

17.Who told you they loved you last?
I believe it was my significant other...or my dad. I hear it a lot - I feel very loved :o)

18.Last furry thing you touched?
One of my dogs, I think the one thats still scared of my brother

19.How many hours a week do you work?
Currently - none at an actual job

20.How many rolls of film do you need to get developed?
Digital Camera had no roll of film AND I just recently printed tons of pictures, so go me

21.Favorite age you have been so far?
*shrugs* either when I was very little or 18, last semester of high school and my first semester of college were pretty good

22.Your worst enemy?
SICKNESS

23.what is your current desk top picture?
MY computer, which I haven't seen in many weeks, has a cute picure of Nathan on it - I am not obsessed/weird

24.what was the last thing you said to someone?
2 seconds ago - ""What IS dad doing?""

25.If you had to choose between a million bucks or to be able to go back in time to fix all of your mistakes, which would you pick?
Not that I'm into money, but I agree, no point in going back in my life. Experience is life's greatest teacher.

"event","And they've done all the tests they can think of, at the moment, and it was all negative, leaving them with one solution which they gave me pills for. For my sake, and others around me, I hope it works. Today was really cool after I got home, part of the sedatives hadn't worn off yet and I was happy-go-lucky Becky! My brother laughed because after 2 weeks of never feeling really good, I was dancing around singing...and losing my balance just a bit. Much like getting tipsy off alcohol *laughs* However, it seems that it has mostly worn off now, pity. I figured out where Tiffany was registered and pretty much did all the hard work for my brother getting her a wedding gift - I'm such a lovely little sister. :o) I really want to fly back to Albuquerque now so I can hurry up and pack and go to TULSA!! T-U-LSA! T-U-LSA!

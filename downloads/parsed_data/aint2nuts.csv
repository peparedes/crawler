"event","Worrying my broken front tooth with my tongue, I lined the white aspirin on the counter in front of me in groups of 10. There were 56 of them. With any luck it would be enough to do the job. I flipped my long bangs out of my eyes, and stared at the lines marching across the counter like soldier of death. 

My name, Angela, means 'Angelic Messenger of God'. It also means trying to give and giving until I have no more to give.. My parents call me Ang or Angie, I hate that. Trying to live up to my name by being good and not causing problems is a very trying proposition. 

My life is staying out of the way of people who want to hurt me.  My parents, random men, other kids. Right now, I want to die. I am tired. Life is futile. Living is overvalued, and I want to die. It is the day before my 14th birthday. The year is 1979. It is July 30th. 

We live in Colorado Springs, at the Air Force Academy. My Dad is in the military and I am what is called a Military Brat.  We move every couple years, and sometimes every year. My Mom works at a real estate agency in town, and I babysit my brothers. Deal was, I babysat for the summer, and I would be trading my hours babysitting for my parents for a 10 speed bike.  Just yesterday I found out that they were giving me my bike for my birthday. I worked the entire summer for something I was getting on my birthday, tomorrow. It is my first bike, ever, and I really feel cheated. 
That isn't why I want to die though. That is really no big deal. Just something unfair that always seems to happen in my life. 

I have tried filling up my life with solitary activities that don't require other humans. Where I can be alone or with kids. Or in control. 

 On the weekend, I work as a Candy striper and volunteer at the hospital. My Dad says I need to be at home, not working for someone else. ""Charity begins at home"" I still go, somehow managing to defy my Dad. Some days it hurts to defy him. It really hurts if Mom isn't home. However I go, mostly on the weekend, when they don't want me around anyway.  Usually I am not part of the family when my parents are home. I am excluded from family stuff a lot. Sometimes by choice, but for the most part, because I have been rebuffed so much, it hurts to keep trying. 

Being a Candy Striper allows me to be alone, surrounded by people.. I have more hours than any other volunteer at the hospital. I have to walk there, almost three miles uphill, coming back to the house was much easier, downhill most of the way. My parents won't take me. They never take me anywhere if they can help it. That is why I had wanted a bike. Freedom.

All day, all the time, I sing and hum to myself. Since I was little, I have loved to sing and there is always a song running though my head.  In 5th grade, Junior High, I joined choir. Each time I perform in front of an audience, I have loved it. We have concerts several times a year. I have to find my own rides to the school. Somehow I do. My parents have never come to a concert to see me. You know what that says to me? That I am so not worth it. Somehow they manage to go to all of my brother's (there are three of them) activities.

Ice skating is my passion, moving alone and fast as I can over the ice. I earn the money babysitting so I can go on Sundays. Eye candy in the form of cadets was nice too!  I walk up and down the hills to the ice skating rink. It is farther than the hospital. I have two friends I sometimes go with, Olivia Hastings, and Linda Pence. They are the first friends I have had in years. 

I know I will never have a boyfriend. I have a chipped front tooth, wild unkempt hair which I try to tame and can't, I haven't gotten a hair cut in years. It flops in my eyes and I get teased about it all the time. My Mom will sometimes sit me down and cut it, but she does a terrible job. I have a lack of clothing, nice or otherwise. My clothing comes from my mother's hand-me-downs, my stomach is flat, but my Mom's pooches out from four kids. So do the pants I have. Polyester pants. Looks like I am pregnant. A lot of the teasing and bullying I take is from other teens about my clothing, hair, tooth and weight. I am now overweight. Years of being told I would gain weight have taken their toll, I eat for comfort now and to keep people, especially men, away. 

 Skiping school is something I love. Being alone hiking in the woods or watching old movies is the highlight of my days No one harassing me, no one teasing, no one beating me. In the fall semester I skipped school 23 times and only got caught once. My Dad caught me, and I thought he would kill me when he caught me trying to sneak out of my window. 

Despite skipping, I was still on the dean's list all of last year. I managed to keep my grades up. School is boring. Moving so often has made it so that some years I am ahead, and some so far behind I can't catch up.  So far I have attended 8 schools. Or 9, I forget. 

Reading is a passion. I love to read.  Sometimes as many as 7 books in a day. Everything I can get my hands on. Especially biographies, fantasy, science fiction, westerns  and romance. Escaping from my life into another world that I would like to live in. I didn't used to like to read. Really couldn't read well until I was in 5th grade and my social studies teacher read us Shane.  Not caring to wait until he finally got to the ending, I went to the library and finished the book during lunch. 

Taking care of kids is fun. Babysitting. Little kids are innocent. They don't care how I look, just that I pay attention to them and play with them. So I babysit when I can get the work, and I have for a long time.  Now I am making $1.00 an hour. it adds up to being able to go ice skating each week.

My brothers are like brothers everywhere. A bother, a pain in the neck. Love them, a lot, but don't always like them.  I love my brothers Mikey who is 3, Bobby who is 9, and my brother Sammy, 12. They are all younger than I am. I am 'in charge' all the time. when my parents aren't home, I am the go to person. Problem is, Bobby and Sammy won't listen to me, ever. Sam and I fight a lot. Knock down fights. Me being in charge aggravates them. They don't help in the house, and I have to get things done before Mom and Dad come home. When Mom and Dad aren't home, I am 'in charge'  Cleaning, laundry, starting dinner.  It gives Mom and especially Dad, someone to blame if things around the house aren't done, or if something goes wrong.

All that is over. I want it to be over. Not just because of having to help around the house. For the other stuff. The harder stuff.  The secret stuff we don't talk about. That I am not allowed to bring up. The skeletons that are me, in the closet that is our family. 
****
Three year old brother Mikey comes into the kitchen for a drink. After he gets his drink, I get mine and I send him back outside to play with my other brothers and his friends. 

I put my drink on the counter, scoop the pills into one hand, my drink of water in the other, and head to my room. Ignoring the dishes in the sink, laundry in the hall and the boys crap everywhere, I walk slowly up the stairs to my bedroom. My thoughts tumbling around to flashes of my horror of a life. Putting the pills on my dresser, with the water, I start thinking about different times that led me to here. Why do I want to die?. 

One of my earliest memories was falling out of a window. I wasn't yet three, probably closer to two. I had climbed onto a table in my room, then looked out the window. I leaned on the screen, not thinking it wouldn't hold my pushing on it. I fell 5 feet to the ground.  I wasn't hurt. I just sat there, stunned and not crying at all. Crying gets me in trouble, and spanked. ""Shut up unless you want me to give you something to cry about"" Is a motto in our home. Even today, at 14, I still get walloped. 

When my Dad found me, I was sitting in the grass, in my diaper, with my legs held high to keep them off the grass that made my skin itch and tickled. He swooped me into his arms, and started yelling at me. He turned me over and spanked me for going out the window. Most of the spanks landed on my diaper and but the ones that landed on my back and legs hurt a lot and his yelling hurt my heart. I have always known I was ""no good"" and a ""trouble maker"", ""stupid"" and ""worthless"".  Those words rebound over and over in my head and in my life. I still hear them, over and over, echoing in my brain, because I have heard them over and over all my life. 

 I was put back into bed, crying, I was told to shut up. It was late afternoon. He got my brother Sammy out of his crib and took him in the living room. They played together until my Mom came home. I had to learn. To be better. To not get in trouble. 

I was alone. Seems like I am always alone. 

When my Mom needs to go somewhere,  I am taken into the base day care. I am very little, still in a diaper. The daycare is dark and shadowy. I am afraid. Each day I am taken in there and each day I cry. One time, a big dark skinned woman there becomes impatient and throws me to the floor. She puts a bin in front of me.  I sit in front of a bin of wooden animals with paper bodies plastered to the wood. I sit alone, crying silently, not trying to interact or play with anyone. 

When you are left by yourself, with strangers, you are alone. 

It is the late 60's at some point. I am little -- two or three. My Dad is overseas. In a war. I know it is a war because someone told me, while I was watching television of people shooting each other, that my Daddy was there. I start having nightmares. I can't sleep. 
At night when I cry from fear, my Mom gets angry and sometimes spanks me. She takes me to the doctor and they give her medicine to give me. I can't tell her in words what I am scared of. What the nightmares are about. Mom is grumpy all the time, and I am by myself dealing with the fear of the unknown. 

I was still two, maybe almost three. I was walking with my Grandpa G. Grandpa lives in Virginia. That is where we live when this happens. Grandpa is my Dad's father. He is old and smells disgusting. Dirty and I realize now that it was the Whiskey or booze on his breath that smelled, and his mouth was just rancid. 

On the sidewalk outside of his house, there was a rusty brown brillo pad on the ground and I started to pick it up. Grandpa yelled at me to not touch it. Told me it would eat my fingers. His loud yelling scared me, and I didn't touch it. I walked a long way around it, and have never touched a brillo pad again. I can't stand the feel of them. They scare me. In a weird way,  what I feel about brillo pads is all tangled up with what happened next. 

We walked back into the house. We were alone. He is drinking alcohol from a big brown bottle. He walked me into the bedroom, and began undressing me, touching me in between my legs and making it hurt. Then he took off his pants.. 

He laid on top of me, and I started crying and fighting to get him off. I couldn't breathe. He put his penis in between my legs and started moving up and down. Suddenly there was wet all over me. Then, I wet myself and he started hitting me, I think because now, the bed was all wet too. 

Laying on the bed crying, I felt bruised and couldn't catch my breath.  Returning with a cloth, he roughly wiped me down, changed the sheets and my diaper, dressed me and told me to take a nap. He yelled at me to shut up and be quiet. I wouldn't stop crying so he hit me over and over.  Then he left.  I laid there smelling the urine odors and the smell of him, and cried quietly.

I was alone. Sometimes it is safer to be alone. 

My Mom used to go to my Grandma's (her Mom's) apartment complex. A huge place called Concord Village. When I was at my Granma's house, I really wanted to go to the park. I was 3. No one would take me. I didn't know the way and the apartment complex was huge. I started out, and got lost. Very lost. I was found by some people who knew that a little three year old shouldn't be alone.  A tiny lady who seemed like she was older than anyone I knew in my lifel gave me some vanilla ice cream, in a blue bowl, not a cone and someone else went to find who I belonged to.  My Mom finally came and she was furious. Mom grabbed the ice cream bowl from me and spanked me. The people there tried to get my Mom to realize she didn't need to be angry. It didn't work. I couldn't finish my ice cream, and then when we went to the apartment, Granma was angry with me. I wasn't allowed to go to the park again until the summer I was 9 and stayed with my Granma for the summer.

At some point when I was 5 and 6 we were living in North Carolina, close enough so that I could see my Granma a lot. I remember Mr. Constantine being my first 'dentist' and pulling a front tooth with a string. He was a neighbor of my Granma's and good friends. When I was 5 I was dared by Mr. Constantine to spit on his car window. So I did. So did my 4 year old brother Sammy. Suddenly Mr. Constantine was no longer joking around and having fun, he was furious and went to tell my Granma. 

We ran. Sammy hid and so did I. In one corner of the apartment complex there was an area we would one day use as a fort. Blocked by bushes, if you pushed your way through, it was built on a hill, surrounded by bricks, with a balcony area overlooking the hill. It smelled of the berries and holly that grew in a line by it and dry dust.  For hours we hid, with my Granma calling for us. When we finally went home, she washed our mouths out with soap, and then used a wooden spoon to spank us. 
Running away just delays problems and punishments

Before I was 6 we had already moved more times than I could remember. We had by then moved more than seven times, between four different states. We were back in Texas, in an apartment complex. My Dad is overseas, in Korea or Vietnam? It is 1971. My brother Bobby is just a year old. My brother Sam is 5. I am 6. 

Each day I walk alone to and from school. I am in first grade. On the way home from school each day I walk along the side of the apartment complex, next to a closed-down carnival. I had never been taken to the carnival, but it was a dream for me to go to ride the rides. Mom never took me, though she took my brothers a couple times in the afternoons while I was in school. 

One day a man approaches me and asks me if I want a Bunny. He asks me my name and tells me he can catch me a bunny if I come with him. Unconvinced, I ask where his carrots are. I tell him to wait and run home to get carrots. When I come back, he is gone.  

A few days later, he is back. Again I run to get carrots or lettuce, and again he is gone when I get back. 

The next time I see the man, he has carrots, and I am with my little brother Sammy. He tells Sammy to leave that he is going to catch me a bunny rabbit, but Sammy tags along he wants a bunny rabbit too. He leads us into the wooded area next to the side of the apartments. Deeper and deeper we go, until we are out of sight of the apartments. I am worried because we aren't supposed to leave the playground area. The man stops and pulls out his pockets and he begins to laugh. He says the rabbit is in his pants.  
At the time, I don't understand, and I don't see what is funny. 

I start getting worried and scared. He tells us to take our clothing off. Sammy is wearing a one piece khaki outfit, and he takes it off quickly. Sammy is naked, and I refuse. The man forces me to touch him. With my mouth and hands. I do it, then self preservation kicks in and I get up, and start to run, fast, towards home.  I get home and all my Mom wants to know is where is Sammy. Fear keeps me quiet about the man. Sammy walks in a little bit after me, and he doesn't talk either. We know we would be in big trouble. I get the belt because I left my brother alone, and because we were supposed to be on the playground. 

I start having nightmares again, they continue to this day. About bad men hurting me making me do things I don't want to do. About being naked in school. About being alone, with no one to protect me.

Running and being alone. The keys to safety. 
My brother and I go to the playground to play. There is a girl there, about 11 years old. She is a mean person. I play alone and stay away from her and her friends.  Not trying to make friends, or be with others. She comes over and tells me to get off the swing. She and her friends want to swing. I tell her no. She starts hitting me, and pulls me off the swing and I attack her. She grabs me by my hair and pulls me away from the swings. She keeps pulling me, across the grass, across the parking lot, past my building. I am kicking, screaming, my body is twisting on the ground ruining my clothing. There are holes all over my pants. She suddenly stops and kicks me. She tells me to never come back to the playground. She leaves me laying on the ground. 

After I caught my breath. My Mom comes over to me. Sammy had gone to get her. Mom makes me march over to the girls apartment, and a man with no legs and in a wheel chair answers the door. She tells him what the girl has done to me. Then he yells at my Mom. Asks her what can he do about her? ""Nothing"" he says. She is wild. Stay away from her. 

My Mom doesn't let me go to the playground after that.  She doesn't want to have to be there to watch me, so she doesn't let ME go. Sammy can. I can't. I am to 'stay away' from that girl. Suddenly, somehow, it is my fault that I got dragged by that girl. For the next few weeks I am made to stay inside. Play alone in my room. Mom is busy, she can't be bothered. She reads, does crafts. I play. Alone.

My 7th birthday, my Mom throws me a surprise birthday party. Mom makes me a strawberry cake with pink frosting and plastic pink flowers on top.  Kids I don't know are invited to the party I don't want. They aren't my friends. I don't know their names or who they are. They are kids my Mom knows through her friends.  They are strangers. I get angry during the party because I don't want to be around all these people. I want to be alone. My wish was granted. I had to go to my room. No cake and ice cream. No presents. Just my room. 
Alone. 

When the party is over. The belt comes out. I didn't act nicely. I wasn't polite. I misbehaved. I was bad. I got a spanking. With the belt. The belt is a thick leather, There are cut outs of circles on the belt with grommets every other hole. They leave circles, big and little on my legs, back and butt.  it is summer time, so no one sees. 

Each time, after the belt, there are bruises in a few days.  It hurts to sit, and when the fall comes, teachers see, because I wear dresses all the time and can't sit. They never ask me about it, they just shake their heads. 

Even in a crowd of people, I am alone. 
[shop lifting by Sammy, getting caught]

My Dad is almost always gone. He works long hours, and he has served two overseas tours, while we stayed behind. He plays softball all the time. He smells like Grandpa a lot after softball games. When he is home, he plays with the boys, watches television and doesn't want me near him. He never hugs me. Never picks me up and swirls me around like he does the boys. Any time he is wrestling with the boys, I have to leave. I can't play too. One thing I dread is when my Mom says ""You wait until your father comes home"" Then I know I will be getting beat with the belt. 

I am almost 8, and Dad is home from Vietnam. We are living outside of Randolph AFB. on Straight Lane. Dad and Mom bought a house.  There are boys down the street that want to play with me. They are from Mexico and speak Spanish. They are 11 and 12. They  take me to a drainage pipe in the park and we play hide and seek. It is the first friends I have tried to have since I was 6. One of the boys catch me, and pulls me into the drainage pipe. He wants me to show my privates. He lays on top of me with his penis out, and humps me. 

I start crying and try to leave then the other boy does the same things.
I spend the summer trying to avoid them. I stay in the house, or the backyard, alone. Every time I see them I get scared again

Had a new Grandbaby. Had found the love of his life and was getting married. He was a big flirt, and flirt outrageously with anything in a skirt. He was the Llamanator. He was <lj user=""jerris_darkrun"">. He leaves a big hole in my life, and in my heart right now.  He was too young to die.

"event","Well my little darlin's all have journals now. All fit their personalities. 
<lj user=katy_unicorn> because she collects unicorns. 
<lj user=tya_the_dragon> because she collects dragons. 
Last... <lj user=rick_tnt> because he is explosive. His choice of name, completely and totally. 

All this means is that each day for an unknown period of time I will have a hot sweaty little body sitting next to me writing in their journals. They will dictate, I will write. It will be interesting to see what their lil' minds come up with to write about. 

Katy already has a couple friends. The rule is, they aren't allowed to read their friends page, I have to read it to them. Katy protested and said she could read well enough and I told her that sometimes people used curse words in their journal. She said, ""That is okay, I already KNOW all the cuss words there are"" @@ (she doesn't) Then I told her that sometimes people dealt with adult content in their journals that I didn't want her knowing yet. She didn't have an answer for that, so it is all good. I will read their friends pages to them and edit heavily as needed. 

I know they all want a journal because Katy has one.  Maybe they will lose interest after a period of time. Rick and Tya are followers but aren't interested enough to use their tokens to buy a live journal account. Good thing, I have 4 dollars left until the end of the month. So it would have to wait anyway. 

We didn't have time to do more than create the journals tonight for Rick and Tya. Rick made a short post. I decided that friends only is the way to go for them, then forgot to make his post friends only. I have to go back into his account and change it. I am bad about remembering for myself. I wish posts would go friends only until you changed it to another default. It would make it easier for me. I often have to go back over a couple days and change my choices to friends only. 

Now, what I really want right now is a nice cold bowl of icecream with sauce on it. Yummy. But, alas, the kids are in bed, I only have four bucks, and Ice cream is not high on my list of priorities. In fact the four bucks has to buy a gallon of milk for this weekend."

"event","101 ways to say I slept all day. Consider the article written, cause I know I have over 100 entries in my journal. But hey, on the up side? at least I am sleeping. That is going to be in doubt when summer arrives and I have the kids home all day. I can't sleep the day away with 6-7-8 year olds in the house. 

So the day has arrived that I have dreaded for 7 years:

My children want to be on the computer as much as I do. 

This creates a rather unique problem, because I DON'T WANT TO SHARE.

My daughter has a journal, and now, my son's therapist thinks it would be a great idea for my son to journal online as well, so that he can read it. Uh huh. Well what if I don't want all my kids online so I can't be online? What it really means is some fairly good quality time with my kids one on one with them, listening to their day, asking questions and writing with them. So on the plus side I guess it is going to be okay. I still am very selfish and DON'T WANT TO SHARE. So THERE. :::::foot stomp:::::

My computer is still doing the crash and burn daily. If I had the money I would go and buy a new computer but I don't have it. :::deep sigh:::Then I could let the kids have the crash and burn computer -- nice Mom aren't I? 


Oh another thing. Sometimes it looks like I am online and really I am sleeping. I walk away from the computer forgetting to put my 'away' sign on and people IM me. Sorry about that. I honestly would never ignore someone when they im me if I was there. So, if I get am im, I answer it. Even those really annoying sex fiends and autobots who im me several times a day. I open them too. 

I haven't eaten yet today, decided to just have one meal tonight. Not the way to lose weight obviously: Looking down at my very well padded body. I am making mini pizzas with the kids choice of bagels or English Muffins. Easy to make, quick, and I can use the meat sauce right out of a jar for the sauce. Yummy. I really want one now, but I will wait. 

I went to the store and spent the last of our money day before yesterday. So now it is pizza tonight. Then, things like mac and cheese, and top ramen. I do have some shrimp in the freezer as well as some chicken. I hate making chicken though. I can never eat meat I have cooked. Ick. 

Okay, well there, I have done it. Updated my journal and whined my way through yet another entry. 

What are you up to? Something more exciting then me I hope."

"event","I took my son to see his therapist. 

Remember last night and Ricky's shit fit? Wow. Did I find out something that made me feel horrible. 

Earlier that evening (right before he came in for dinner) Ricky had someone threaten him saying they were bringing a shotgun to the park to 'shot and kill me'. When I put the chain of events into perspective between what happened earlier then his fit, I feel bad. 

Obviously he was running on an adrenaline high after what happened. He said he and a friend of his hid away from the person who threatened them and his friend ran home to tell his Mom. Apparently when I called him in, he was still hiding from the person who threatened him. 

He doesn't know why he didn't tell me about it. He is straight on that point now. He knows to tell me if someone EVER threatens him, brings a gun to the playground or threatens to. 

What would make a 7 year old threaten someone like that? Sick world we live in. My son better not ever make that kind of threat. I will wash his mouth out with soap."

Dinner is all cleaned up and put away. Woo hoo for me. That is something I rarely get done the same day. LOL

I read my journal/friend's entries. Have replied to what I could. 

Angel is on tonight so I will be back at about 9 to read again. Hopefully more people will have written so I have something to read. 

I am feeling better. As better as one can when they are hit with mega doses of allergies and asthma attacks all at once. I am hoping to sleep again tonight, but I slept the day away too, so it isn't likely. 

I don't know what the pollen count is here today, but whatever is in the air today, I am so allergic to my eyes were running, bright red, and I have a sore on the white of the eye. My sinus' are so congested and I am blowing my nose every other minute, gobs and gobs. Just what you wanted to know I am sure! 

So, to recap. I slept last night from 8-7:15 this morning. I slept today from 8:15 to 3:00. Which means I have been awake all of 5 hours so far today. 

Feast or famine. Too much or too little. The Hypnos, the God of Sleep needs to balance things out for me."

We have a rule in our house. It is simple, but I want it to happen everyday. You take ONE BITE out of anything served. ONE BITE. So tonight I served the kids chicken, potato salad and coleslaw and my son just ate the chicken and without saying anything to me, got up and threw away the rest of his food. Not taking his one bite. 

I told him to go to his bed (for a timeout). He started kicking and throwing things in anger. (He does have a hell of a temper on him). I went in and told him to stop or I would be spanking him. He didn't stop, instead he yelled at me, I spanked him. 

What I should have done is told him he was going to be paying me for his temper. I didn't think of it because, well, I was too ticked with his temper. I should have put myself in a timeout before dealing with him. Not feeling good isn't a good excuse for spanking out of frustraition. 

I am not anti-spanking. I am very anti-spanking in any kind of emotional angst and usually there are other ways of dealing with your child than spanking them. I tend to fall back onto how I was raised. I hate that, so I have been trying to not spank. 

So, now I am feeling rotten, he is in his room cussing me out (in an eight year old kinda way). I am out here writing this. 

Update:
My husband called and talked to my son. My son apologised for being rude, and for backtalking, and for throwing away good food. He went into his room to pick it up (the things he kicked) and hopefully he will be calmer going into the rest of the night."

What is for dinner? 
Burritos for dinner. Yummy. 

Today I am wishing that I:

Went to the library
Went to the grocery store
Called my husband for money (still might do that, wish me luck)
Went to Target for a keyboard
Went to Payless to buy a pair of shoes for me. (although, if I never leave the house, I will never need a pair of shoes right?)
Cleaned the house.
Did the rest of the dishes.
Cleaned off the porch. 

Things I did do:
Took my daughter's money from her birthday to buy her a LJ account (she wanted a pretty page and more icons... okay... pay me)

Talked to <lj user=BlkMysticalRose> while she and Katy designed what her journal looks like. It is going to be really pretty, exactly what Katy wanted. 

<lj user=tsita> made some great icons for my daughter. Really cute! 

Called <lj user=dashhula> at her home in Denver Colorado. Thought I spent my last few minutes of long distance that I had left on my month, but actually have 15 minutes left still. Anyone else want a call? My month starts over tomorrow. 

That was my day, and my wishful day. Busy little person wasn't I? *G*"

Just this past November I started letting my kids go outside with me not being right there watching them. They are 6-7 and soon to be 8. 

There are some parents that let their children out of the house at age 3 or 4 or 5 and let them wander, never checking on them until it gets dark. I am not one of those parents. I check every 20-30 minutes and they have to check in every half hour (they have watches). 

Seems like I gave them an inch (letting them go outside) and they have grown up so fast and far. Doing so much on their own. 

I told my daughter there was a new law. She isn't allowed to grow up any older than 7. She can't get older and leave me. She told me ""You aren't the President"" and ""Show me the law."" She is reading over my shoulder and laughing about it. ""You act like the Mom's are the President"". 

Yep I am the law. Parenting is a dictatorship, not a democracy. Just call me Heir Mommy."

I told the kids they could watch cartoons this morning. It is 1:39 and cartoons are still on. My son is still watching. I am about to cut his drug of choice supply off. 

My daughters are taking a bath. All of my kids love their baths and beg me to be able to take them. If they could, they would take one everyday or twice a day. I let them take one every other day. They can take a shower on odd days. They will play in there until they are cold and shivery. I have to make them get out usually. 

Needless to say, the picnic didn't happen. I didn't sleep last night and was able to sleep this morning. I might do an evening picnic, but most likely we will just hang around here today.

"event","Oh I see how you all are. All those comments generated over a pretty pink penis. The most comments I have ever gotten, all over a stolen image that my children said looked like an umbrella. None of them got what it was. I need to educate my children better. (No, I didn't enlighten them)

Took the kids grocery shopping. Bought us a watermelon. Promised the kids a picnic in the park with watermelon, cold fried chicken, potato salad, cole slaw. We bought everything we needed for a picnic in the park. I forgot milk though. I also bought a box of pancakes (I know, waste of money -- go ahead, kick me) for tomorrow and forgot the SYRUP~!! Ack. I don't have anything but strawberries to make into syrup so strawberry syrup over pancakes it is tomorrow for breakfast. 2.50 for a large container of strawberries. I splurged. This year if strawberries go under 7 for a half flat I am going to be freezing them. 


Then we went to play at McDonalds. (Yeah, I know, we spend MUCH TO MUCH time at McDonalds). So, I am sitting there reading, and my daughter (6 year old) comes over to me and smiles and her bottom tooth is just hanging there ready to be pulled. I told her to go get me a napkin, and I said, ""Let me jiggle it"" and pulled her tooth. She told me in a firm voice ""MOMMY I don't WANT my TOOTH PULLED!"" she went to feel where her tooth was and got a shocked look on her face. She then looked very serious and said, ""I better get a dollar for that"". It bled briefly and then stopped and she went off to play. She didn't even know that I had pulled it. 

While I was standing in line for icecream (10 cent kid cones) a wee little girl came and stood right next to me with her hand on my pants. She looked like she was about 18 months old. Her Mom came running over, totally shocked that her daughter would adopt another person. As she was being taken away the little girl said, plain as can be ""Icecream for me!"" I told the mother I was getting kiddie cones for the kids and she must have figured if she stood right next to me, I would mistake her for my own and feed her an ice cream too. It was really funny. The mother said she never goes to strangers. I said, ""Honey, anyone with ice cream is never a stranger"". 

Got home tonight and the wind was blowing to beat the band. I got the mail and found out that I am worth more to my children dead than alive. Listen to this. If I die, my kids can recieve 293 dollars (up to 587 a month) until they are 18. However, I don't qualifty for disability benefits. I do however have money coming to me if I reach retirement age. If I retire at 67 I will have 189 a month coming to me. All the more reason to keep my marriage intact until I have been married to my husband for another two years. So what it all boils down to is that I am worth 30 bucks more dead than alive. :-) Makes me wonder what my husband is worth. 

I wish I could collect my husbands disability benefits. 

So, here I am bored, Saturday night. Someone come on and entertain me. I have a pale pink penis and know how to use it! ::::waving pink penis in the air [in vibrating mode] in a threatening manner::::: Visions of Lorena Bobbit come to mind."

"event","It is close to midnight. I am a little tired, but not sleepy. Hoping for a good night's sleep tonight. Let me start off by saying, I am lucky. I have three beautiful healthy children. While I am not healthy, and I am often in pain, I am also not dying. I know that. However, sometimes I just want to sit back and wish you know? Wish that things could be different. That I could have more.

The house is quiet. The kids all asleep. It is the first time the house has been quiet all day. The lack of sound is so nice. 

Tonight I started getting introspective wondering what life is for and why I am on this planet. The only reason I can see is that I have three children who will need me for the next 12 years. Then, all bets are off. I really have to find more of a reason to live than that. My children are important, but they shouldn't be the be all and end all of my life and living. 

SO, I started thinking about what I wanted from life. What I have. What I would like my life to be like and what I could do to make my life how I want it. 

It gets really frustrating knowing that the things I want from life aren't things I will be able to achieve. Not easily, not at all. 

So, my ideal world, if I could craft it would be different from what I am living now. 

In my idea world, I would like a house with a yard for the children. A craft area for myself with space for doing scrap booking and for printing out pictures. Nice cameras to take pictures. 

Three bedrooms for the kids. So they each have their own space. 

For me,I want a king size bed, with a quilt on it. Roses on the fabric. Angels and roses on the decor in the room. Take my collection of angels and demitasse cups out of the box and put them in the dining room in a breakfront. 

I want an area with a place to put books. A library with a place to read. A back yard with a place to sit and enjoy the day or evening.

I want a computer that works so I don't have to worry about it crashing all the time. Something I can complete my book on. With a printer so I can print coupons, pictures and worksheets for the kids -- and my books out. Ideally I want one for the children too, so they can write and do their homework. 

Homeschooling. I want to be well enough to home school my children.  I did it for 6 months with great success, until I got too sick to continue. 

I want to be well enough to write full time for money and well enough to get my book done and sell it. 

Sleeping at night would be nice too. No pain from chronic fatigue or arthritis. I want to be able to walk each day without pain shooting up my spine, in every joint, or down my legs.  I want to be able to breath without having an asthma or allergy attack. Go places without panic attacks. Leave the house to do simple things like shopping without having to gear up for the trip out of the house for a couple days. I want to go a couple months without a migraine. Sleep knowing I am not stopping breathing 20 times an hour. Awake knowing I have gotten a good night's sleep. Last, I would like to NOT be bipolar. I would like to not be depressed, or manic or swinging one to another in little swings that drive the people around me nuts. 

I would like enough money to take a trip once a year to someplace. I want to travel in an RV and see the rest of the US. I would love to travel overseas. Take my children to see the wonders that the world offers. 

Last, I want someone to come in afternoons, clean the house, make dinner and be a help to me. Someone who knows how to organize and can help me keep it organized, and I want to be able to pay them to do it. 

Short of winning a miraculous Lottery (I don't play) and some miracle that I will get well, I know this will all never happen, but it is nice to dream isn't it? 

What is your ideal world like? What do you want from your home and life, your community and world?"

""All this dreamcatcher catches is DUST"" 
My daughter (7) tonight on the subject of the dreamcatcher that apparently isn't working for her. 

My daughter Katy has an interesting theory on Night'mares'. It started when she was 4. She believes that a black horse comes in the middle of the night and brings bad dreams. Mind you she is 7 so she hasn't read books that might lead her to believe or develop this little theory of hers.  I have told her that horses aren't allowed in the house, cause they aren't potty trainable... she doesn't buy it. She says it is a magical horse and it doesn't need to poop. Okay, I will buy that."

Now my kids are wanting me to judge a coloring contest. Devide that baby in half, choose between three kids I love, make one happy and two sad. I hate their coloring contests and refuse to judge them. They still have them. Fine. K' leave me out of the judging. 

Today has been a weird day. Probably because there are things I SHOULD HAVE DONE (Like, remember, go to the food bank?). That I was too freakin agoraphobic to do. 

Ah well. What is for dinner in your neck of the woods? We had deep dish apple pie, mainly because I had the fixings for it. Then I made some rice with peas and chicken seasonings. Not really all that balanced, but it was good. I made the kids pasta with cheese sauce.

"event","I had a LJ friend (someone I met on LJ and considered a friend) who suddenly and without warning removed himself from my journal and from all the bipolar forums. He made some comment about a 'line' I had crossed and made a negative comment about some comment I don't even remember making to one of his posts. 

I think it was in response to him using <lj comm=bipolarsurvival> as a place to hold a flame war. I had removed his post (flaming someone)from the forum because I don't hold with flaming people no matter what the provocation, and especially on a forum he was supposed to be helping to MODERATE!!! (I moderate there too... see we were supposed to be good friends). 

So, when he withdrew, I sent him several emails asking what was up. No response. I got one email asking me to remove him as moderator. Done.

Today I removed him from my friends list, which apparently so enraged him he posted that I had crossed a line (what... again???) and please remove him from my journal. (Uhm Hello.... knocking on your wood block head ... I already removed you). 

I wish I knew what his problem was, but really, life is too short to dwell on this bullspit for more than a few minutes it takes to write this post. 

Onwards and upwards.... vent over. Oh except this.... 
*************************************************************

Bear --- I don't know what line you think I have crossed, but consider yourself removed. Actually I removed you before you posted, and got a heads up from someone about your post. 

I am sorry you feel so casual about throwing friends away without communication with the person. Sad really, and your illness is not a valid excuse. I emailed you several times to ask what the problem is and I won't be wasting any more time on this. 

I wish you luck in your life. 
God Bless."

"event","I am thinking about buying the mobile home I am in. However it is going to take me a couple years to save up what they want for a down payment. 

They want 29,900.00 for the mobile home. 
2900 dollars down. (I have 710 down now, in the form of my security deposit)
9% interest, 10 year loan. 

The good thing is that they might be willing to get the things that need to be repaired (holes in the walls, missing screens, exterior wall deteriorating, linolium torn, needs painting on the exterior and repairs on some cosmetic items outside) before I purchase the mobile home as part of the deal. I am also asking that they put rock down in the side yard as promised two years ago. 

My living room area is big enough to put in an extra bedroom or office in what would be a formal dining area and is now my office area. I am thinking about having that area eventually framed in and finished to make another room. 

I already know I won't have the money to buy another place for at least two years, so I am going to start painting and getting the place I am living in up to speed. It is the first time I have been even a little interested in a project or activity. 

My only (and biggest) problem is going to be saving up the money. I might lose all my benefits in trying to improve my way of life. Catch 22. Saving the money means I don't need money. See? Eventually that will be true. Buying will lower my 'rent' payments by over 100 a month. Eventually it will lower my payments to lot rent (currently under 300 a month). When that happens, I will be able to go off public assistance completely, other than my disability payment. :-) 

Anybody gotta buck to spare? <G>"

"event","I am putting this whole mess behind a cut, no sense in ruining someone else's day. <lj-cut> Well after having to get an advance on my direct deposit to make it through the month, I have to get another to make it through the week. Next month is going to be mega tight and we will be eatting a lot of top ramen for dinner for days on end. 

My tire got a big bulge in the side of it. Couldn't be repaired. almost 100 bucks down the drain for a tire. I don't have it of course, so I need to get onto my bank web site and request the advance. 

Add to that, I am going to have to take the car in to find out what is wrong with it. Dang. When it is cold it makes a very high pitch engine running noise. When I turn it gets worse. When it warms up, the noise disappears. Strange. Watch, I will take it in and it won't do it for them. The noise is DAMN LOUD let me tell you. Then it just disappears after running the engine for more than a half hour. Which means I am making a huge racket going to and from my kids school in the morning. :-(

Took the girls to girl scouts tonight. Took a half gallon of ice cream for snack. They let the girls (four of them, all 6 years old) eat an entire half gallon of ice cream. Is it just me or is that just way too freakin much? I mean, I can see a small scoop or two, but 1/4 of a gallon? Yowsa. That is a pint of ice cream EACH. 

Then coming home from their meeting, the girls had made ornaments for Christmas. Okay, I can deal with making ornaments, but at least make them out of something NON Breakable? They made them out of GLASS BALLS. So guess what happens? One of my daughters drops and breaks her ornament. In the driveway, UNDER the car, in a place I can't reach until I back the car out of the drive (narrow driveway). Many tears of course. 

Funny thing is I know EXACTLY how she feels. I told her what happened to me when I was 6 coming home from Brownies. We had made Chex mix in jars, with pretty jars and pretty ribbons, and the canning jar top that we decorated with felt and fabric and lace. Getting out of the car, I dropped the canning jar on the ground, smashed to smithereens. I can still picture me in my uniform, with my present in my hands, getting out of the car, then the jar slipping. Standing by the white nova, like it was yesterday. . . 32 years ago. I felt horrible, and cried and cried about it. My Mom even let me call the leader to ask if there was any more left over that I could have to give to my Mom. (Of course there wasn't). Amazing that that feeling comes back to me, complete with the feeling of wanting to cry whenever I smell Worchester Sauce or Rice chex. I had a flash back so vividly when she dropped the ornament I wanted to cry with my little girl and protect her from life's unfairness. 

So here I sit, totally broke. Can't buy a cake this week for my daughter's birthday. I might have enough spare change laying around in pennies that I can buy a cake mix and sugar for icing it. I am thinking that I should have her party the following weekend and make the excuse that with Thanksgiving it would be better to celebrate it the following weekend. I already got her a dollar store baby doll and a little princess dress up kit. It is actually a nice little doll that you can wash for a dollar, dressed in a diaper and tshirt. 

I feel horrible that this is all she gets for her birthday, when her sister got a 'new to her' bike this year. (Yard sale, 20 bucks, in great condition). Tya needs a new bike, hers in too little for her, but I can't afford another one and haven't been able to find one at the yard sales. 

Damn I hate being poor. </lj-cut>"

In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames by ropes.

It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that for a month   
after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his new son-in-law      
with all the mead he could drink.  Mead is a honey beer and because their  
calendar was lunar based, this period was called the ""honey month,""        
known today as the ""honeymoon.""

In English pubs, ale is ordered by pints and quarts.  So in old England,

own pints and quarts and settle down.  It's where we get the phrase        
""mind your Ps and Qs.""

Many years ago in England, pub frequenters had a whistle baked into the    
rim or handle of their ceramic cups.  When they needed a refill, they used                         
the whistle to get service.  ""Wet your whistle"" was inspired by this       
practice.

In Scotland, a new game was invented.  It was entitled ""Gentlemen Only

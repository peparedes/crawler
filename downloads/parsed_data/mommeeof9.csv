"event","They told me recently that any medications that are taken long term have to
be filled by their mail order pharmacy or they are not covered. So Hubby's
dr faxed in prescriptions for his heart meds to them. We receive a shipment
and open it to find out the medicine is full price, almost $800 for a 3
month supply. When I called them and asked why, they stated we had not met
our deductible yet. I sent the medicine back, as they have in our file that
they are not to fill any prescriptions for over $100 without calling us and
getting our permission. They still want us to pay for the meds, as they did
not authorize me to return them. They stated they have received the medicine
I sent back, and can ship them back to me if I want them to, but I have to
pay for the medicine regardless of whether I have it or not. Is there anyone
in the state of Virginia who can help me?"

"event","Where to start? Each of my little nurslings has had their own style of nursing. The oldest was so laid back. She was happy as long as she was allowed to nurse when she indicated she was hungry. The hospital experience with her labor and delivery was the best. I had just finished my 4 yrs in the US army 5 weeks before she was born (3 weeks before her due date). My hubby was able to get transferred to Virginia, so we were nearer our families. Th dr didn't want me to drive across the country 37 weeks pregnant. My hubby drove and I flew to NYC, where my parents picked me up for the 3+ hour drive to their house near Binghamton, NY. Anne's due date came and went. My hubby drove down to the DC area and stayed with my oldest sister and her husband while he was looking for an apartment near his work. He stayed down here during the week and drove up to NY every weekend to see me. He had just driven back to DC 24 hours before I went into labor. The phone in our apartment wasn't hooked up yet, so my Aunt and Cousin drove over from their house 5 miles away to tell my hubby I was in Labor. In NY, it was a clear night, cold but not much precipitaion. Down here, they were having an ice storm. My hubby drove for less than 60 miles before he decided to pull off an exit and rest until the weather cleared up. He finally got to the hospital in the afternoon. I had a short labor-less than 6 hours from my water breaking until she was born. Thankfully, my mom was there with me. As an experienced mom of 7 (she nursed 5 of us) she was the best person I could have had to encourage me. She held Anne while my episiotomy was sewn up. Then she encouraged me to nurse her early and frequently. Anne was 21 1/4 inches long and 10 pounds even at birth, 9 pounds 7 ounces when we left the hospital, and a little over 11 pounds at her 2 week check-up. She loved to nurse. Now at 16, she is 5ft 8 inches tall and 140 pounds.

I thought I knew everything when I started this entry in early January 2006. September 9 brought us #9, my first c-section. He was as easy to nurse as the first 8, though the recovery was harder. Then, April 3, 2009 Ms Rosalie was born 5 weeks 4 days before her due date. She spent 3 weeks in the Nicu until she finally learned how to eat from a bottle. Though I am usually opposed to a bottle for a new baby, I could not be with her 24/7 so I could try to nurse her for every feeding. I thought it would be easy to train her to nurse once we were home. It took my entire Family medical leave to teach her to nurse well enough so I did not have to pump after every feeding and then supplement her with a bottle. She still has a not so great latch, but is getting more efficient with age and her mouth getting bigger."

"event","from <lj user=morgangallagher> Many people get upset at me, when I talk about formula risks.  It's as if by telling parents the truth about bacterial contanimation in formula, and how babies lives are at risk - in the West - I'm on some sort of guilt trip for mothers.

People rarely see it for what it is - a desperate plea for people to find out the truth, and to make informed choices for their beloved newborns.  A stand against misinformation and profiteering.

A mother and father in Belgium, are today reaping the costs of the lack of information available to them.  When their precious five day old baby died from bacterial contamination in the formula given to him in hospital, they took the decision to sure Nestle, and the hospital, for not letting them know the facts of the risks.

Today, they lost their case.  Why?  Because the judge ruled that bacterial contamination of baby formula was a known and accepted risk.  Therefore, you can't sue after the event.

Is it a known and accepted risk in your world?

Do you see formula fed babies, and inform the parents of the life threatening risk they are undertaking on behalf of their newborns?  Do you make sure pregnant women you know of, know and understand these risks?

Or are you too scared to mention it, in case you are seen as being one of those nutcases?

Are you too scared to tell people that they run the risk of their baby dying from meningitis, from using formula?

If only someone had had the courage to tell this mother.... she may not be standing at her son's graveside, forever blaming herself for not knowing the truth, for not understanding the risks.

Protect formula fed infants - TELL THE MOTHERS WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW TO MAKE THE DAMN THING AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE.  Do not tell them not to boil the water as it will ruin the bacteria you've put in from harvesting ground bacteria for cheap omega 3.  YOU HAVE TO KILL THE DAMN BACTERIA OR YOU RUN THE RISK OF KILLING THE BABY.

A risk so well known, that you can't sue when your baby dies.

.<lj-cut text=""his letter""> Mrs Dorothy A.

Dear Mrs. 

Thank you for your email of November 28 in which you expressed your discontent with Warren County School Board's policy on breastfeeding in its schools and inquired about Virginia laws on the subject.

Your correspondence with Superintendent McInnis was appropriate and her response was accurate. Public schools are not owned, leased or controlled by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and so she is correct in stating that the statute providing the right to breastfeed does not apply to schools such as Warren County Jr High School. I have enclosed the statutes pertaining to the right to breasfeed. (Copy was not in the letter).

Local school boards are constitutionally provided with the right to establish their own policies including those which regulate breastfeeding practices. Accordingly, your concerns most appropriately should be addressed to the school board.

I hope my response is helpful to you in understanding the reasons why state law regarding breastfeeding does not apply to property not owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Thank you for taking the time to write to me. If I may be of further service, please do not hesitate to contact my office.

With Best regards,
Very truly yours,
Mark D. Obenshain

Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to make the Warren County school system aware that one of the staff members violated state law. On Friday, October 20th, 2006, around 1:50 PM, I was sitting in the main office of Warren County Junior High School with my three youngest children waiting for my daughter's triennial IEP (Individualized Education Plan) meeting to start. My six week old son was hungry and screaming. I latched him on to nurse. Within five minutes, one of your staff members walked over to me and insistently requested I move to an empty office to feed him. She continued to stand over me and stated her requests at least three times. She said that her teenaged male aids were uncomfortable seeing me nurse. This was despite the fact that I was wearing a nursing shirt and he was in a sling, both of which covered my entire upper body. In order to avoid confrontation, I complied with her request. I was made to feel like there was something wrong with me providing the best nutrition to my baby. However, Virginia law Code 2.2-1147.1 (2002), allows me to nurse in any public area where I am otherwise authorized to be. This includes, but is not limited, to schools, public buildings, parks, shopping centers, etc, etc. 

I am requesting a letter apology from your school for this incident.
This type of harassment could result in me consulting my attorney.

Sincerely,
Dorothy </lj-cut>"

I've had a few during the day, but not enough to convince me this is the real deal. The dr says by the ultrasound Samuel is due on the 3rd of September. By dates, I say he was due yesterday. Of course, they believe technology and not me. I was there- you think they would believe me instead."

I love my little munchkins, but they can cause major frustration sometimes. Besides, my hubby promised to do housework if I had a paying job and make sure the kids did their chores also. I'll be working nights, so I may not have to pump much/often. I don't know how much my little one will need, as she has only had 2 bottles of EBM in her 10 months of life. Argh. Decisions, excitement, pure terror. ;)"

<font color=""#FFFFFF"">Trolls aren't quite as badass as their Orc counterparts, but that might be attributed to their preference for warmer climates.  Sometimes, it's just too hot to destroy everything.  Nonetheless - a pissed-off troll is not a pleasant thing to encounter... As a troll, you might want to watch your tempter, lest you wind up in a bad, bad place because of it.<br><br>As a hunter, you prefer to be on the sidelines.  You would rather see all angles of a situation - probably to find the best position to shoot from.  You like animals, but mostly because they (might) do your bidding.</font><br><br></td></tr>

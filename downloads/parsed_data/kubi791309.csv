<P><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;So right after that we went over to the broken down Amaco station.

<P><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;It was getting really cold so we had to go home. Sam stole Tim's sk8board and booked ass home.

So then we walked home and hung out...basicly. THen we went online and sent gay porn to these guys. ;) What a night. Can't wait for tomorrow.</FONT> </FONT></P>"

(keep in mind we're walking with the pizza box in our hands and people are staring at us) so we get to the gas station and i buy a cherry coke and starburst. sam gets a mountain dew. oh, and before we left we gave justin 3 pieces of our pizza, because were nice. then we went to duncans and i got the chocolate neccos and sam couldnt get nething because she has thriteen cents. <STRONG>thats right, thirteen cents</STRONG>. &lt;-&lt;---god i love that kid. </P>
<P>So then we went over to johnny's house. he was grounded so we sat outside his window til we couldnt feel our asses then went to sun laundry, where we sat there for an hour. <STRONG>So, here we are in sun laundry. im eating my chocolate neccos and their powdery. sam decides not to tell me that i have white powder all over my face so all the people in there were staring at me because i look like a coke dealer.</STRONG> Moving on! So me and sam went to MY ID for like ten minutes then started the long trek home. Oh yeah i got a blister from my god damn coach shoes. </P>
<P>So we get home then we go downstairs and go on the computer. Sam decides to put some chap stick on. <U>pardon me, alot of chap stick on.</U> so shes sititng there putting on this&nbsp; flava-craze for like twenty minutes. no lie. so she finally gets done with moisturizing her lips then she declares that her lips are burning so she grabs a piece of paperand&nbsp; scrapes her lips for like ten minutes. keep in mind im staring at her like shes licking a frog. she turns to me and says,<STRONG> ""what? youve never done this before!?""</STRONG> and i repley, <STRONG>""no, samantha, i have not""</STRONG> &lt;&lt;&lt;---once again, a priceless moment brought to you by samantha bubb. loves it.</P>

"event","Today was up and down. I went to soccer practice, then i went down to the lake on the snowmobiles with sam for that fire and ice thinger. That was fun. Esspecially the fireworks. Then we went out to dinner...that was alright. And to top it off i came home and went on AIM and to my surprise everyone hates me. I quit. What the hell happened? Why did everyone change? Did i change? I dont know whats going on. Its such a waste--all of it. My moms calling me. God i hate her. And almost everybody else.


I almost wish i didnt meet you and i almost wish i didnt like you. then again, id never wish that. you gave me one of the best summers of my life. thank you.

it's bugging me, grating me
and twisting me around
yeah i'm endlessly caving in
and turning inside out

'cause i want it now
i want it now
give me your heart and you soul
and i'm not breaking out 
i'm breaking out
last chance to lose control

it's holding me, morphing me
and forcing me to strive
to be endlessly cold within
and dreaming i'm alive

'cause i want it now
i want it now
give me your heart and your soul
and i'm not breaking down 
i'm breaking out
last chance to lose control

and want you now
i want you now
i'll feel my heart implode
and i'm breaking out
escaping now
feeling my faith erode"

When you were here before, 
couldn't look you in the eye. 
You're just like an angel, 
your skin makes me cry. 
You float like a feather, 
in a beautiful world 
I wish I was special, 
you're so fucking special. 

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. 
What the hell am I doing here? 
I don't belong here. 

I don't care if it hurts, 
I want to have control. 
I want a perfect body, 
I want a perfect soul. 
I want you to notice, 
when I'm not around. 
You're so fucking special, 
I wish I was special. 

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. 
What the hell am I doing here?. 
I don't belong here 

She's running out the door, 
she's running, 
she run, run, run, run, run. 

Whatever makes you happy, 
whatever you want. 
You're so fucking special, 
I wish I was special, 

but I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. 
What the hell am I doing here? 
I don't belong here, 
I don't belong here."

"event","today, was such an awesome day. yeah i was way beyond exhausted but...it was just plain cool. first period we didn't do anything really, so that was cool. second period was tolerable, like we didn't do anything that i couldn't handle and my grade is an A in that class which makes me even happier (considering it is english). third period, i acutally knew how to do the work which makes me basically exstatic. fourth we took notes but then talked for the rest of the time about mrs. bartholomew's upcoming baby, and all of her struggles during her last pregnancy. plus we are doing a lab this week with dry ice and that is awesome! lunch, i had a blast...i laughed so hard! math, i mean...there is no way math can be fun...but, it was easy and i got an A on my quiz! leadership was awesome because just coming off of sadies dance, i was tired and mrs. weeks was actually nice to me. i got 35 1/2 hours from one week. then, i laughed twice as hard because niki said so many things that were just histarical. so, that means i don't need anymore hours for leadership to get an A. but, if i want to waiver the final i need like 50 more hours. and then, i went to track practice and i threw so well today. my first throw was 100 feet. i have never hit 100 feet! and i was so happy. my shortest throw was 95 feet. all i need to do is just keep that same mentality, technique, and stature in my meets. well, i need to get my homework done before practice. bye for now! i will tell you how soccer turns out."

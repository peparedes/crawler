I HAVE A LITTLE STORY FOR YOU:

the tale of the insane bananna man...

umkay, so sarah and her mom and i where at the salvation army one day and we were waiting in line to pay and this old guy wearing a bright yellow spandex shirt was in line behind us. he was bying a pair of shoes and he was really rushed so we let him go in front of us and then he was so happy he tried to give us money and then when we declined he insisted we take his banannas. when we once again declined he insisted that they were organic trader joes banannas (what does that have to do with anything!?!?!)
this aparently made the offer undeniable. so we took the fucking trader joes banannas and we left. then we went to whole foods to get something or other and just as we were coming out there was bananna man with his little bicycle and he told us ""if you ask the bagging people in the whole foods place to not put yur stuff in a bag you can save 10 cents""...okay then....so the long and the short of it was that he was stalking us on his little bicycle and we threw out his organic trader joes banannas because we feared for our lives...phyco or what!?!?!

ok as you can tell we're really tired and hyper so yueah..."

Some good song lyrics:

BLACKBIRD (Beatles)

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life 
You were only waiting for this moment to be free.

Blackbird fly, Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird fly, Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arrive
You were only waiting for this moment to arrive
You were only waiting for this moment to arrive"

MAKE IT OFF THE ISLAND

There were three people stranded on an island, a brunette, a redhead, and a blonde. The brunette looked over the water to the mainland and estimated about 20 miles to shore. So she announced, ""I'm going to try to swim to shore."" So she swam out five miles, and got really tired. She swam out ten miles from the island, and she was too tired to go on, so she drowned. 

The second one, the redhead, said to herself, ""I wonder if she made it. I guess it's better to try to get to the mainland than stay here and starve."" So she attempts to swim out. The redhead had a lot more endurance than the brunette, as she swam out 10 miles before she even got tired. After 15 miles, she was too tired to go on, so she drowned.

So the blonde thought to herself, ""I wonder if they made it! I think I'd better try to make it, too."" So she swam out 5 miles, ten miles, fifteen miles, and finally nineteen miles from the island. The shore was just in sight, but she said, ""I'm too tired to go on!"" So she swam back.

BLONDE FLYING FIRST CLASS

There is a blonde on a plane to New York. She is sitting in the first class section, but her ticket says that she should be in the coach section. A flight attendant realizes the blonde's mistake and asks her politely to move. The blonde won't move. All she says is, ""I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, and I'm going to New York."" 

The flight attendant goes and tells all of the other flight attendants. They all try to persuade the blonde to move, but she won't move. All she says is, ""I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, and I'm going to New York.""

The flight attendants go and tell the pilot about the obnoxious blonde. They tell him the only thing that she says. He puts the plane on auto-pilot and whispers something in the blonde's ear.

Immediately, she gets up and moves to her normal seat. Then the pilot goes back to fly the plane. The flight attendants are all very curious about how the pilot made the blonde move so quickly.

They ask him and he says, ""Oh, it was easy. All I had to do was tell her that the first class section wasn't going to New York!""


OTHER RANDOM JOKES...HAHAHAHA


THE RULES OF CHOCOLATE


1.	If you've got melted chocolate all over your hands, you're eating it too slowly.

2.	Chocolate covered raisins, cherries, orange slices & strawberries all count as fruit, so eat as many as you want.

3.	The problem: How to get 2 pounds of chocolate home from the store in a hot car. The solution is simple: Eat it in the parking lot.

4.	Diet tip: Eat a chocolate bar before each meal. It'll take the edge off your appetite, and you'll eat less.

5.	If calories are an issue, store your chocolate on top of the fridge. Calories are afraid of heights, and they will jump out of the chocolate to protect themselves.

6.	If I eat equal amounts of dark chocolate and white chocolate, is that a balanced diet? Don't they actually counteract each other?

7.	Money talks. Chocolate sings. Beautifully.

8.	Chocolate has many preservatives. Preservatives make you look younger.

9.	Q. Why is there no such organization as Chocoholics Anonymous? A. Because no one wants to quit.

10.	Put ""eat chocolate"" at the top of your list of things to do today. That way, at least you'll get one thing done.

11.	A nice box of chocolates can provide your total daily intake of calories in one place. Isn't that handy?

12.	If you can't eat all your chocolate, it will keep in the freezer. But if you can't eat all your chocolate, what's wrong with you? 


WHY EMAIL IS LIKE A PENIS

1. Those who have it would be devastated if it were ever cut off. 

2. Those who have it think that those who don't are somehow inferior. 

3. Those who don't have it may agree that it's neat, but think it's not worth the fuss that those who have it make about it. 

4. Many of those who don't have it would like to try it, a phenomenon psychologists call ""Email Envy."" 

5. It's more fun when it's up, but this makes it hard to get any real work done. 

6. In the distant past, its only purpose was to transmit information vital to the survival of the species. Some people still think that's the only thing it should be used for, but most folks today use it mostly for fun. 

7. If you don't take proper precautions, it can spread viruses. 

8. If you use it too much, you'll find it becomes more and more difficult to think coherently. 

9. We attach an importance to it that is far greater than its actual size and influence warrant. 

10. If you're not careful what you do with it, it can get you into a lot of trouble.

11. If you play with it too much, you go blind.

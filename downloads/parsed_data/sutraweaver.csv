"event","I had a visit from Hawk today. I seem to have an affinity for hawks, and he comes around usually when I'm getting back on my path or have strayed from it.

I don't know much about animal totems or animal guides, but I feel that when animals cross our paths in noticeable ways they have something to tell us. Usually Hawk seems to tell me to keep a higher perspective. I usually see him gliding gracefully above or beside me.

Today he had a different message. I was driving down the road, and he shot out of a try and soared at eye level right in front of my car. It was close enough that I thought I might even hit him. He went traight across the street at a fast speed and shot down an alley. I realized he had probably seen prey from across the street and was going for it regardless of the danger the cars presented.

His message this time was for me to identify my goals/dreams/desires, and then go after them without fear and with the full confidence that I can reach them. He also showed me that you have to be ""higher"" than what you're going for in order to see it in the proper perspective. You can overcome a problem or situation if you're in it, focused on it and can't see past it."

"event","I've been exhausted and not myself from being sick, so this will be a short entry.

About a year ago I was driving in my car and was slipping into that hypnotic (and oh so safe) state that we call get in often when driving. I glanced at the car in front of me. To my surprise I realized I could see, in my mind's eye, a microscopic view of the paint and metal on the car. For awhile I thought this was my imagination. As time went on (and by on, I mean around and around of course) I started playing around with this idea of 'throwing' my awareness. What I found out was that I could put it into any texture and see it vividly at small levels.

For awhile I didn't tell anyone about this because I wanted to know what I was doing first. One day I told my (now) ex. She told me she heard that's one of the things that helps doing energy healing. With that, I realized I was able to sense when people had headaches, backaches, etc.

I still thought I was probably imagining it. I now know I'm not! I've experimented with it long enough, and several people have said they also have this ability.

Stuart Wilde talks about this in his book Infinite Self. He describes it as feeling something out. He says we are all feelings and that we can feel our way into anything. It works with physical objects, the past, the future, the present, remote distances, questions and problems. I recommend trying this ""feeling around"" and see what you think of it. Try taking a simple object like a blank piece of paper. Money might work well for this because of the color variations and the inks you would be able to see. Look at the paper, but don't see it. Allow your mind to open, your awareness to slip out and merge with the paper. Just be open in your mind to whatever images you receive. If it works better for you, try something audible, tactile, etc. Use whatever you are comfortable with. It's a fun experience and can be very useful."

"event","I realized today just how much our expectations effect each other. It's widely accepted (though rarely acknowledged) that our expectations in a direct encounter with another human being influence them. However, I'm learning just how much even indirect expectations effect others. This seems blatantly obvious now considering the fact that thoughts have no limits of time and space.

Here's an example of direct expectations to illustrate what I mean. Imagine yourself in a situation where you have to ask someone, who's opinion you value, for money. Let's pretend this happens a lot, and in the past you haven't tended to pay them back. This time when you ask for money, they give it to you. You respond with ""Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back tomorrow."" They scoff with ""I doubt it. You never have before."" They have now placed a direct expectation on you as to how you are with paying back borrowed money. Now, even if you fully intend to pay it back this time, it will be far more difficult to.

An indirect expectation would be the exact situation, except the ""I doubt it"" expectation would be done silently in thought or maybe out loud but behind your back to another person. These indirect expectations carry just as much power as direct ones. In fact, they're quite possibly more dangerous because the issue isn't faced. You fully intend to pay them back, but you just can't seem to follow through with that intention. You have no idea why. They can't understand why you don't either. At least with a direct expectation you can ""Hey buddy! Lighten your expectations of me and I just might surprise you.""

It's hard enough for us to be mindful of our direct expectations, let alone our indirect ones. Here's a strategy that might help. Anytime you find yourself thinking an expectation and wondering if you should say it, do so. If you are already thinking it and cannot quickly release that thought and transform it into support, then speak it directly to the person so it can be brought to light and dealt with."

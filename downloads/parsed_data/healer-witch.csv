You have many friends and<br>they all enjoy you as much as you do them. You<br>are skilled with your hands and would be able<br>to last in a more remote home.

You have your feet on the<br>ground and are in touch with reality. Some may<br>say you need to lighten up, but you are just<br>not that way. It's not that you don't enjoy<br>having fun, you only find it in more calmer<br>activities such as writing or reading a book.<br>But before you have your fun you always make<br>sure your work is done. You are considered the<br>reliable one among your friends, you would<br>never betray anyone just like and are not<br>influenced on peer-pressure. Friends and family<br>can always come to you for guidance because you<br>are wise and smart. You know what is right and<br>what is wrong and you study hard to become<br>something big in the future. The bad side is<br>that your friend/s feel ignored when you spend<br>more time with books and papers rather with<br>them. You are not such a people person and are<br>sometimes a question-mark on how to behave<br>around them at certain times. Luckily it always<br>works out, somehow. Love is not really desired<br>in your world right now, maybe in the future<br>when you've got a work and so on under control.<br>After all, you are a perfectionist. Rate and<br>message!

You're the bewildered heroine of the story, a timid<br>little Flutter Unicorn.  (Your father was a<br>Unicorn and your mother was a Flutter Pony and<br>your heritage tends to confuse people.)  People<br>see you as ethereal, delicate, and holy, but<br>really you're just a naive and confused little<br>Pony wandering around lost in the darkness of a<br>Gothic tragedy that's too complicated for you<br>to comprehend.  It isn't your fault that your<br>colouring and your symbol and your wings make<br>you glaringly symbolic.<br>
Your father promised to send you the Angel of Music<br>when he reached Heaven, and you pinned all your<br>hopes on the dream of the Angel's coming, and<br>the promise that he would help you become the<br>great opera singer you always wanted to be.<br>When that Angel turned out to be the Phantom of<br>the Opera himself, you had a bit of a shock,<br>but when you learned to love him, you saved his<br>soul from the darkness it had descended<br>into.<br>
Being glaringly symbolic has its benefits!

Selfless, powerful, and<br>divine, you are one blessed with a certain<br>cosmic grace. You are unequalled in<br>peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of<br>Light your wings are massive and a soft white<br>or silver. Countless feathers grace them and<br>radiate the light within you for all the world<br>to see. You are a defender, protector, and<br>caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver<br>of the wrong, chances are you are taken<br>advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often.<br>But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in<br>everyone and so this mistreatment does not make<br>you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will<br>try to help misguided souls find themselves and<br>peace. However not all Angelics allow<br>themselves to be gotten the better of - the<br>Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting<br>for the sake of Justice and protection of those<br>less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever<br>change - the world needs more people like you.

And the tips, ah, sweet tips. $90 in tips - nice. All of the tips I get are going into the puppy fund. Yeah, it's official, I'm getting a dog. Can't wait. I figured I could use the company - my place does get rather lonely at night. Besides, Mom and Dad aren't here so they have no say in the matter. ::snicker::

Ah, Cornelia's talked in me into hosting one or two drawings I did of her dream guy. Yeah, that one. She described him - I did some sketching. I have to say he is cute but like I mentioned earlier - he strikes me as my age. And yeah, it's so squicking me out.

It's not my problem - but I'll have to deal with it eventually, knowing my luck. ::massages temples::

I, ah, live by myself since my parents are out of town - constantly. They occasionally come home but those are few and far between. I don't remember the last time they were home to tell you the honest truth. So I occasionally stay at the Hale's house so I don't feel neglected.

Cornelia's been dropping by the house lately, telling me of these dreams she has about this guy from a different world or something along those lines. I worry about her - something feels utterly wrong about that.

Anyway, I better run - I need to get my homework done before I go babysit next door.

Dear God,

Please give me the strength and discipline to stop smoking... and if i can't do that.... then baby steps to 3 cigarettes or less per day.

Sincerely yours,

Nancy Soon Kim

PS. I didn't realize that Relient K was singing about you.

""Getting into you""

When i made up my mind
And my heart along with that
To live not for myself
But yet for god, somebody said
Do you know what you are getting yourself into

When i finally ironed out
All of my priorities
And asked god to remove the doubt
That makes me so unsure of these
Things i ask myself, i ask myself
Do you know what you are getting yourself into

I'm getting into you
Because you got to me, in a way words can't describe
I'm getting into you
Because i've got to be
You're essential to survive
I'm going to love you with my life

When he looked at me and said
I kind of view you as a son
And for a second our eyes met
And i met that with a question
Do you know what you are getting yourself into

I've been a liar and i'll never amount to
The kind of person you deserve to worship you
You say you will not dwell on what i did but rather what i do you say
I love you and that's what you are getting yourself into

He said, i love you and that's what you are getting yourself into"

The first doctor said ""nope you're fine, its just your sternocleidomastoid"" but i didn't believe him and went to my regular doctor who said i had swollen lymph nodes ( i mean come on, i'm a student but they are pretty darn prominent, bastard wasted $100 of my freakin dollars to tell me i had a muscle problem...

No, it wasn't that i got trashed ( i did get drunk) but couple that with sunny weather...  not so good. I fell asleep 3rd quarter.. woke up in time for the 4th, but apparently i missed a great comeback and a 15 minute review. But i did get to see LT in action.. hes the man...

I was looking back on some pictures and old entries, and i came across a picture... funny... i just talked to him today... just pouring salt in the wound as i reminisce about the summer. Despite the fact that things didn't work out quite the way i had hoped... this past summer was a blast. I only hope this coming winter will be just as fun (LOOK OUT MAMMOTH AND CANADA!)

The move is this weekend... i wish i was rich and i could just pay someone to pack my stuff and move it and decorate and arrange my room.

I was at the crafts store today and they were having a frame sale... so i thought to myself ""PERFECT, I CAN PUT THE IDEA IN EFFECT"" so i bought 4 18x24 inch frames, simple black metal rim with a glass top... debating whether or not i would use the glass...

so i'm at home, cutting up some boards, and i step ontop of my wooden board, which ended up not being my wooden board, but the wooden backing to the frame and i hear a large CRACK.... and yes.. i shattered the glass to the frame. and of course i recently threw out my vaccuum because it was not functioning properly. so i thought... well, i wasn't planning on using the glass... so i take a sample cut out, look at it in the frame with and without the glass.. and yes... it looks a lot better with the glass on... DAGNABBIT!!!

currently a patch of my floor has a wooden board on it so i don't step on the glass underneath.

I usually come and go from my parents house with a LOT of stuff, bags, laundry basket, books etc. My parking spot is right by the elevator which opens up to my hallway. I was extremely ticked off to find someones car parked in my spot. WHO THE FUCK DO THEY THINK THEY ARE. So i left a note on the car and it said:

""someone (me) pays for this spot so please don't park here""

I had managed to refrain from writing ""someone (me) pays for this spot so DON""T FUCKING PARK HERE!"" 

If i see that car again my note will read something like this ""Someone (me)pays for this spot, if i catch your car here again, something will be missing from it""

no joke, it may be tire caps, screws underneath the car, windshield wipers, something they wouldn't notice was missing at first.

""because deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are serious medical complications for inpatient rehabilitation clients, studies have been conducted to identigy the usefulness of screening procedures in asymptomatic clients. A noninvasive test that has been used in rehabilitation setting is impedance plethysmography (IPG). It is condiered to be cost-effective and save. Katz and McCulla conducted a study of this test in 483 rehabilitation clients with varying fiagnoses. IPG was conducted within several days after admission in each client. Routine <b>use of this test, however, showed that it had poor value as a screening tool</b> for deep vein thrombosis. Additional conclusions were that anticoagulant prophylaxis is a better method and ultrasonography is a better assessment tool. 

WHY THE F* DID THEY INCLUDE THIS IN THE BOOK, THEN, IF ITS A WORTHLESS TEST?!

(jk cuz)  Both seem to think i have gastroenteritis (ie stomach flu). Apparently it can take up to 10 days to completely resolve (alex says 4-7 days... see alex and his twin below) This is day #6.

So friday.. my friend was going to the korean market in SD. I had a dream the night before about going to the market and i saw the street sign that it was located on. So my friend calls asking where it was and as I was looking it up on the internet, I thought to myself ""i think its on Mercury St."" Guess what.. it was on Mercury St. WEIRD.

Friday at 6 pm ish.. i was on myspace. I was flipping through my friends and saw Leo's page and left him a message hello because i hadnt seen/talked to him in over a year. Later that night I went to Ocean's (again) and guess what... i ran into Leo. WEIRD.

Ok, the picture is a little hard to tell... but i think these two doods look TOTALLY alike (except one has mad tats).

Ok...when people say that... i know they are lying because it is not possible for your liver to hurt. But, if it could hurt, mine is probably enduring some sort of ""cramping"" feeling. 

I had a fun weekend.. did you? oh well, i don't care because this month its all about me. 

Friday:
Woke up randomly at 900 am. What the hell? Got my car washed (for the 3rd time this month due to pipes leaking above my parking spot and sprinkler systems). Found the tree i was looking for for the past week. Went to the bank.

If someone texts you ""do you know where there is a green thumb?"" what do you think they were asking?
L. text me back ""first you're an alkie, not you're a green thumb? I don't know anyone at this time of day but at night yes.""
i was thoroughly confused by this text and disregarded it. Dwen text me ""a nursery?"" BINGO!!! AFter looking back at my texts, i realized that L. was thinkin i was trying to score some of the Mary Jane. I thought ""FUCKING STONER"" and made a mental note to self to give him crap about it. Later, after talking to several people... it turns out most of the people i had text that message all thought i was looking for weed. I had forgotten the infamous Cypress Hill song Dr. Green Thumb.  

Had lunch at Cheese Cake factory with Jr. and Anh. 

Ocean's at night again. I love that place. best Dj. =D   and i have not yet had a bad night there. What is better than no cover, pint sized mixed drinks that are strong as hell and cost 5-6$. Check off another fun friday night.

Saturday:
Woke up at 8 am randomly. Terry had left the TV on the NFL express station. I was too lazy to get up and change the channel so I watched the history of the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburg Steelers for about 90 minutes. In that time, i learned how the Cleveland Browns failed to win the AFC championship 3 years in a row. Kosar was a great quarter back. They played pittsburg twice a year so everytime they play its a big deal because of the rivalry. The last game of the franchise was bitter sweet. Amongst a packed stadium of cheering fans, they won their last game EVER. It was very sad. 

Went to eat at a Pilipino restaurant for the first time in my life. I never knew where there was one even though i love the food. Only ate lumpiang and pancit before. I went to eat with Jr, Lowell, and Terry. The food is sooo freakin great ,but beware to feel like shit post eating. Ate a bunch of BBQed chicken, squid, beef, and pork with garlic fried rice. Lots of grease. I bit into my lumpiang, and, no joke, grease dribbled down my lip and onto my chin. We food comaed on the way to Proper. Finally went to the store of a friend http://www.apropersite.com/test_site/index_r.html to get some new kicks. They got the best shoes! Oh man... i bought 2.

Went to the golf range in 85 degree weather + humidit with the sun beating down. Bad idea. Got a few good ones in however. I realized, the 9 iron is my favorite club right now.

Went to Sutras at night. I don't go to meet people, or have any expectations, just to support the local DJ  =D and to kick it with friends (over a few drinks of course).  however, met a cute japanese guy there. What is wrong with me? Why can't i build up the courage to ask a guy for his number? I'm chicken shit, thats why. Turns out he came with a female friend who is a girlfriend  of a dood that went to high school with my friends. Get it? small world.

Ate a boat load at shorehouse cafe at 3 am. Oh shore house, you never cease to make me happy at 3 am and then make me feel like shit at 10 am. Thanks

Sunday:
I haven't been to church in a while so i made the effort to go today. I hate going by myself but i sucked it up and went. I woke up at 1115 so that i could be there for the 12 o clock service. I got there at 1215 which was ok, i only missed the singing. I get there and they were still singing. I ran into Charles (Mike Ko's cousin) in the back of the church, he was standing against the wall. 
Me: Lets go sit down
Charles: (looks at me weird) nah.. i'll just stand right here.
Me: (look at him weird back) Just come sit with me
Charles: Why? It's almost over.
Me: WHAT?!
Charles: Service starts at 11 now. 
DOH!!!!!

My weekend in a nut shell. =D

Edit... i had a different entry, but i decided to change it because it sounded like i was a  raging alcoholic. But i am not.

So what will i do on vacation? Chill, drink (possibly... who am i kidding.. most definitely) hang out with friends without the worry of  ""what do i need to study tomorrow.""

I think its funny, i have these friends that have been joking around with me and each other about ""theres something wrong with nancy... shes been going out a lot lately."" i have 2 things to say to them

1) You bastards that have been calling me a lush... you've been drinking with me every weekend! WTH!
2) I don't care, i'm on vacation

List of things to do for the next month...

1) Go to SF
2) Go to Catalina
3) possibly go to Vegas
4) read a book: i haven't read a leisurely book in a while. The only books i've read are the school ones which are pretty dry. I've got on my shelf... the chronicles of narnia, which was given to me by sarah. I've read them when i was younger, and i started again but never got around to finishing it. Then there is East of Eden which the ex. tells me is great. I've had it for a while now, just got side tracked. Then reread Watership Down. i <3 that book. So GREAT!! Oh Fiver... what would they do without you?!   (though i have a feeling the reading thing is not gonna happen)
5) BEACH!!!
6) Get my computer reformatted by my personal tech support... his name is dwen. =D
7) since i have become a permanent guest at the Wen-Attoh-Oak household, I kindly told them i would clean the house for them. But i refuse to touch the bathrooms.

Pizza night at dwens this sunday =D

I am home. Its sad cuz i have no cat to talk to anymore (yes i used to talk to my cat). *sigh* its been almost a month now. =*(

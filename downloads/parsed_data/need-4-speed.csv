As you can all see, I kinda forget to keep this updated.  So, just so everyone knows, I'll probably be using myspace instead as most people I know are using that.

Check it out...

"event","Well, I haven't been writing in a while, so this one should make up for it:

I've been having a bad week at work (last week).  My boss wasn't really pleased with the way I've been running things.  He brought up stuff that happened like two months (or more) ago and expects me to remember every little detail now.  I think he should have brought this up when it first happened.  But he isn't the best boss in the world - he's really demanding and not very good at motivating his employees, etc.

To make a long story short, he's not in the best mood at the moment.  He gave me a list of things to try and change and I've done some things and am fixing the rest.  He's really pushy in this area.  He asks people to basically change their personality to make his life run smoother.  Like for example, he told me a couple times to ""use my head"" and ""use common sense"".  Then right after he said that, he said I that I'm a smart guy but I just need to change a few things.  He's really a jerk for lack of a better word.  I think he's trying to attempt to be my role model or something.  He's saying that this is my first time working 9-5 and there are a lot of things that you need to learn and it will take some time, and he keeps going on and on.  He's acting like I look up to him and he's trying to make things better for me, but he's really just overwelmed with his work load and wants to take it out on everyone else.  That's what it boils down too, really.

Some of his points were valid and I could see why he said what he said, but some things (like saying I should use my head and some common sense) he went to far.  I know I'm a smart guy and I'm not letting him try and shape me any different.  Honestly, how can someone use the phrase ""use your head and some common sense"" and then right after that say ""your a smart guy"".  He really needs to get his facts straight before yelling at someone.

Like, the other week he accused me of abandoning Radio Shack.  (Radio Shack is also owned by him and is in the same building as Cascade Graphics and the Slave River Journal (aka SRJ) - where I work.  He owns several different companies and they're all in the same building:  Radio Shack, Cascade Graphics, Slave River Journal - the local newspaper, and Cascade Computers.  I'm officially employed under Cascade Graphics and the SRJ but I answer the phones for all these companies as well as send/recieve faxes, file paper work, etc.  I'm also expected to work in Radio Shack when it gets busy.  Half of my job wasn't even on my job description really.)  So, he accused me of leaving Radio Shack without anyone being in the store.  I would never do something like that anyways.  To make a long story short, he yelled at me first and then explained what happened from his point of view.  I then corrected him and told him what actually happened and then he just kinda sighed and then left.  He doesn't know how to be an employer really.  Normally, you'd think that you would get your facts straight first and then yell if necessary but he does the yelling first - which makes things worse because I was wondering why he's yelling at me.  He was yelling things that I didn't even do and accusing me of things that didn't even happen.

HE'S JUST PLAIN FRUSTRATING."

Anyways, don't really have much to say.  Just felt like writting.  Oh, my aunt and uncle got a 27"" TV for Christmas so no more little tiny TV.  And my uncle just went and bought a DVD player too so they've finally started to get up-to-date.
Well I'm tired so ttyl."

I took some photos of the northern lights last night and the actually showed up.  I expected them to but at the same time I was a bit shocked that they did.  It's just really cool.

I LOVE IT!

1. It's taking FOREVER to finish this website.:(
2. It's been two years now and I still haven't gone on one ""real"" date yet!:'(
3. AND,... finally, my new camera won't let me download my photos on to my computer.  Probably cause it's so old!!!lol :D

My cousin just came home the other day.  So, it's tons of fun.  My other cousin comes home this afternoon.  Should get busy really soon.

Well, I can't wait for Christmas! Only a couple more days.  Gotta finish my Christmas shopping.  Procrastination is the best:)

Time for bed so I can actually be awake tomorrow when I meet all the new people who come back for Christmas.

So, he's like ""Well your not working so why should you get paid?""  It's so unfair.  But neither is life!"

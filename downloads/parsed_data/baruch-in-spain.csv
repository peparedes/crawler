"event","AAAAHHHH SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED

Sorry this entry has taken so long. My computer was broken for the better part of a week.

<lj-cut text=""Read if you're interested."">OK, so weekend before last: Friday night was fun, a bunch of us met in front of El Corte Ingl&#233;s (this chain of department stores) and went out clubbing. &#161;w00t for las discotecas! The name is mildly deceiving: they don&#8217;t play disco. Thank god. Though it would be sort of amusing. However, the section of town we went to, nicknamed &#8220;La Zona,&#8221; was pretty deficient on the good-clubbing front. plus drinks were ridiculously expensive in all the places we tried. Then we split up somewhat, and I went with Elena and Elsie to this cool bar named Lucas, which a couple of Spaniards had recommended. a very nice alcohol-to-money-spent ratio, which is rare around here. After a while Elsie took a cab home and Elena and I went to this really cute little bar which had life-size sculptures of Jake and Elwood (the blues brothers) sitting at the bar permanently. We had these amazing sorbet things. mine was pi&#241;a and hers was melocot&#243;n. got her home and then got what turned out to be quite a surprisingly good sleep. don&#8217;t remember what I did Saturday&#8230;probably something relatively uninteresting. por la noche I went with Jess, Jin Su, and Emmy to a different (and significantly better) district in town called El Rollo. LOTS of fun clubs with pretty good music of all varieties, and most importantly, LOTS of Spanish kids to meet. A lot of them are drunk, and they&#8217;re fun to talk to, because they tried to speak to us in slurred English and we responded in extremely poor (and sometimes slurred) Spanish. A few SYAers got way too drunk, which just seems silly to me. I mean, throwing up just isn&#8217;t fun. I&#8217;ve never thrown up as a result of alcohol, but I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;s about as fun as the normal kind. That is not at all. And the entire not remembering what the fuck happened thing doesn&#8217;t seem so great either. All in all, if one drinks, it should be fun. Tipsy can be fun sometimes. SickDrunk is not fun. That&#8217;s how I see it, anyway. A few girls and this guy had a lot of random makeout escapades, which was amusing and quite facepalm. They were all quite drunk by the time we got there, even&#8230;ack. Anyway, that night I hung out with Cheyenne, who&#8217;s pretty awesome. She reminds me a LOT of Aster, actually. But also somewhat of Sarah. Hm. She was pretty tipsy, and definitely needed me to walk her home. It worked out just fine. Sunday I woke up earlyish because I couldn&#8217;t sleep, and I was pretty well rested then too. Wasn&#8217;t so much looking forward to a day with the family&#8230;was kind of sick of them at the time. In some ways I&#8217;m still not such a fan, but that day they were particularly bothersome. The padres came back in time for lunch, and my dad and I commenced the cooking of these beef thingies as well as ham. Mmm&#8230;ham. Ok, I&#8217;m going to explain something here: my family&#8217;s position on drinking. At dinner, when my mom tentatively brings up trying a little bit of the wine they made with the grapes in their back yard, my dad says something along the lines of &#8220;No. He can&#8217;t drink. He&#8217;s not allowed to have any alcohol at all.&#8221; Of course the mom wholeheartedly agrees, and that&#8217;s that. But on that Sunday morning, sitting with the dad cooking the ham, he asked what my favorite drink was. I asked him what he meant, and he said he meant what kinds of things I had when I went out drinking with friends. I said I liked vodka, and he said he agreed, but liked rum better. Later, alone with the mom, she had me try a couple glasses of this great wine from La Rioja, una comunidad en Espa&#241;a. But when they&#8217;re together again, alcohol is forbidden again. So what else has happened&#8230;hm&#8230;. My classes! I&#8217;m taking Advanced Precalc, English (the only two taught in English) Art History, Cinema (essentially a Spanish history class&#8230;we haven&#8217;t watched a movie and won&#8217;t for a while), AP Spanish Lit, Lengua (We&#8217;re going to be taking the AP&#8230;but the course itself is &#8220;advanced study&#8221; or something like that, as in slightly more than AP&#8230;no idea what the deal is, nor do I particularly care). The math teacher is CRAZY, as in really weird, and not particularly good. But he&#8217;s a fun guy. English is ok, and the teacher is usually good. It&#8217;s a lot like my English class at home, but I liked Mr. Holmes better. Also, in comparison to my most recent teacher in the same general category, Eden, is only the best teacher ever, so it&#8217;s hard to live up to that standard. Art History is ok, very simplistic as of now, but that&#8217;s probably because we&#8217;re studying prehistory and Egypt. However, knowing as much as I do about Egypt thanks to AcDec, the material seems a bit rushed. Cine is ok&#8230;kind of boring right now since we&#8217;re really just going over geography. Though Oriol, the teacher, is AMAZING. He&#8217;s such an awesome guy and good at communicating with us kids. He&#8217;s also my advisor, which is good. I can&#8217;t wait until later in the course where we mix history with movies&#8230;it&#8217;s described as like the normal Spanish History course but from a more cultural and literary perspective, which is what interests me. So yay. AP Lit is, as of now, the bane of my existence. Not only does the teacher speak ridiculously fast, but the material is IMPOSSIBLE. We read this cuento in middle Spanish. Half the time I couldn&#8217;t tell which words were antiquated Spanish ones, modern ones spelled differently, or which were actual words I just didn&#8217;t know. Aaaah. Lengua is pretty good, as the teacher is hilarious. Marta is my favorite Spaniard, ever. She&#8217;s pretty ADD in terms of running the class though, lots of random vocabulary she&#8217;s just reminded of and teaches us. Hopefully it&#8217;ll get more organized as the year goes on&#8230;vocabulary I can learn outside of school, what I need is more detailed advanced grammar stuff. Later last week I went bowling with Elena, Elsie, Kate, and Isabel, which was fun. It&#8217;s INSIDE this mall, on the second floor. Gran Casa is a pretty incredible place. I got zeroes for the first two frames, a seven the third frame, and proceeded to get three strikes, a spare, and a 12something overall, kicking everyone else&#8217;s ass. That&#8217;s what they get for making fun of me ^_^. That Friday morning we got on this fucking AWESOME double decker coach bus to go to Alqu&#233;zar, a little pueblo in the north of Arag&#243;n, the comunidad of which Zaragoza is the capital. That place was beautiful! We walked around the city in our advisor groups, went to this 1500 year old church, sat on the edge of a cliff looking at the foothills of the Piranees, and generally just enjoyed being there. Lost a game of pool to Elena because I called a pocket for the eight ball and got it in another one (she plays where you have to call the pocket&#8230;bah humbug). We stayed in a hostel, which was cool, but also odd because the 15 guys slept in these two really really long beds, so it got kind of hot and smelly over the course of the night. In the morning we got up and hiked into this valley, which was gorgeous. Of course, I forgot to bring my camera, because I&#8217;m smart like that. Other people took lots of pictures that I can steal. There was this FREEZING cold natural pool thing created by a waterfall, and the brave ones among us swam in it for a while, the result being every one of us got sick. But it was fun anyway. We took the same bus back and stopped by this little town called Huesca, which was ok, but not very interesting. Then we got home Saturday afternoon, just in time for everyone to go out and party. Had a good time, but it was kind of scary Sunday afternoon when I was told that apparently one girl got really sick. Like, REALLY sick. Silly alcohol abuser people. She ended up ok, though, and there weren&#8217;t any serious repercussions, which I found odd. But oh well. This past week was rather uneventful. Last night was a movie night thing organized by the school and there were some Spanish kids there, though I wasn&#8217;t able to get through the huge crowd to talk to them. And there was a lot of pizza, most of which Miguel (Mike) and I ate. And he got kinder eggs, and I put together the toys for him, because again I&#8217;m cool like that. Afterwards was some rather boring wandering with Elena and Elsie, because apparently most Spaniards don&#8217;t go to clubs on Fridays, only on Saturdays. Who knows what they&#8217;re doing on Fridays.</lj-cut>

I apologize profusely about my horrible keeping-in-touch ability, everything&#8217;s just so busy here, schoolwise and citywise and languagewise. I very much appreciate the two letters I&#8217;ve thus far received, and they both made me exceedingly happy. I&#8217;ll be replying to them over the course of the next week. And I do remember birthdays, I swear, and those letters/packages will be in the mail over the next week as well. I love you all, and thank you for bothering to read all this."

"event","Today was busy. Actually had to get up early to go to school, but, of course, se me olvid&#243; to turn on the alarm clock after setting it. Blech. Anyway, I still got there on time, and saw a couple de mis compa&#241;eros que subieron al autob&#250;s conmigo. Llegu&#233; al cole (escuela), and a very long day of orientaci&#243;n began. We divided into groups, and grupo numero dos was told about the upcoming trips first. We&#8217;re going EVERYWHERE en Espa&#241;a, es incre&#237;ble. Al sur, visitaremos ciudades de Andaluc&#237;a&#8230;como Sevilla (where I plan on getting my hair cut just to say I&#8217;ve seen el &#8220;peluquero de Sevilla&#8221;, Granada y C&#243;rdoba, donde ya he visitado, y otros sitios distintos. Vamos to Barcelona, claro, and tons of other great places&#8230;vamos a hike in los Pirineos! Anyway, despu&#233;s, two teachers of art history spoke to us about las familias espa&#241;olas. Very. Quickly. Creo que they didn&#8217;t know las palabras &#8220;m&#225;s despacio, por favor.&#8221; Pues, afterwards caminaba por las calles with some friends, and that was pretty fun. We went to a caf&#233; y ped&#237; un cordado. Es como un espresso. La caf&#233; aqu&#237; es MUCH MUCH MUCH more fuerte que en los EEUU. Anyway, after el descanso, we went back to our groups and learned more about the city itself and about various health safety instructions. Pish, liability. Lots of longass orientation stuff, descriptions de las varias clases (voy a post mi horario), and so on and so forth hasta las dos menos cuarto de la ma&#241;ana (en Espa&#241;a las 13:45 is still the morning). We then went out en &#8220;parejas&#8221; (we clumped together after we left&#8230;Sr. Morse (el director) wanted us to be in pairs so as to not seem so touristyteenageryamericano) para almorzar. We went to this ok and cheap Greek place. Yummmmm. Despu&#233;s, &#237;bamos de compras para school supplies.
Lo siento si no ten&#233;is mucho inter&#233;s, but it&#8217;s what&#8217;s been happening in my day. And, as estoy seguro que you understand, it&#8217;s all EXTREMELY exciting and nuevo para mi.
After some more speeches, etc. by los profesores, we had to take three tests. Ew. The Spanish written was superf&#225;cil, and the Spanish oral went well, despite a couple moments of hesitation when I had to remember el pluscuamperfecto. The math pensaba que I was going to BOMB. I went into the room, checked off the box que indic&#243; that I was looking to get into the lower level of precalc. So I take the test. Remember some of it, make a lot of guesses. Turns out I got quite a bit more right than I thought, and the math guy recommended calc AB. Huh? No. Dude, I haven&#8217;t even TAKEN the second half of precalc, no recuerdo much of the first half, and I suck at math. Well, apparently Sr. Wharton (mi profesor de matem&#225;ticas en los EEUU) recommended me for Calc. &#191;C&#243;mo? Anyway, the math teacher here doesn&#8217;t speak a word of Spanish, and he&#8217;s this anciano muy simp&#225;tico. So yeah, I ended up in precalc honors. ::shrug::. Enough with the math. It&#8217;s boring.
SO! Once most of us hemos sacado los ex&#225;menes, a group of us (this group is getting pretty consistent&#8230;I don&#8217;t want cliquiness, but it seems to be the direction this is taking) walked around a bit to get more supplies and para comprar m&#243;viles. Era. Muy. Complejado. The mobile phone plans in Europe aren&#8217;t so much different than those in the US. The problem is, that I had to a) barter, b) understand what the fuck I agreed to, c) understand how to set up the phone, all en espa&#241;ol. But the end result is me. With a cell. Hoorah.
Unfortunateness, a little bit. There&#8217;s this girl who was talking to me a lot the first couple of days but I didn&#8217;t really have the energy to truly befriend, and as of yesterday I realized how interesting/entertaining/smart she is. Claro, as soon as I start paying attention and actively spending time with her within our little groupymabob, she gets all disdainful, or at least I perceive it as such. A bit of avoidance, etc. People are weird. I don&#8217;t think &#8220;LET ME BE YOUR FRIIIIEEEENNNNDDD&#8221; would do such a good job. Anyway, it&#8217;s only the fourth day or so. Plenty of time for everyone to get more amiable.
Got home after getting el m&#243;vil, and started preparing for la cena. &#161;Porque Mario, Elena, y sus novios visitaron! I think Mario&#8217;s girlfriend se llama Nata, pero no estoy seguro. Anyway, it was absolutely wonderful, meeting the whole family at once. Everyone&#8217;s so close, even Elena&#8217;s relatively new boyfriend, and they all treat me as if I&#8217;d been there since birth. They my Spanish is a lot better than those of the other SYAers they&#8217;ve hosted at first, which is very encouraging. I think if my Spanish were much worse I&#8217;d be a hell of a lot more afraid to go out there and try to speak. I was able to get in on the conversations very well, de los EEUU, de mi altura, del gobierno de Espa&#241;a&#8212;de todos. I also made several jokes and puns etc. en espa&#241;ol, which I&#8217;m very proud of. I feel like once one can tell a joke in a language, they have a certain level of competence which is extremely useful. Mario&#8217;s girlfriend is great&#8230;very cool. She&#8217;s patient and helps me when I need it, and she doesn&#8217;t dumb down her language ever. She lets me figure out new words or expressions on my own (y aprend&#237; algunas palabras tacas &#9786;.) We were able to have conversations about food, music, y varias cosas que no pensaba que I could talk about fluently, coherently, and quickly. She brings out the best in my Spanish &#9786;.
I forgot to mention. The other day, I had to console my host mother, in Spanish, over the recent death of her grandfather in a car crash. It was una experiencia muy rara. And explain the not-so-alive condition of my mother.
It&#8217;s interesting how my Spanglish in these posts eventually recedes to almost all English. I really need to start writing my entries only in Spanish at some point. Como Marie Antoinette, &#8220;They don&#8217;t have knowledge of the Spanish language? Let them use online translators!&#8221;"

"event","Today was nice, for the most part. Got up pretty late again, had some breakfast of yogurt y melocotones, and had a discussion with mi madre sobre the different barrios de la ciudad. Watched a &#8220;Formula Uno&#8221; race con mi pap&#225; por la tarde, y un hombre espa&#241;ol, who is ranked number one in the world overall, came in second behind some colombiano. A bit of waiting around, something for lunch y de postre, and then I headed over to the school for an orientation meeting. Mi madre me dice que no era necesario llegar al colegio EXACTLY a las cinco, that it was muy informal y we could arrive any time from five to six. Of course, we get there a las seis menos quince, and lo and behold the meeting was almost over. Cuarenta y cinco minutos tarde, said Griffin Morse (el director del programa). Dios m&#237;o. Just goes to show how tranquilos these espa&#241;oles really are. Mi pap&#225; says that a lot, &#8220;tranquilo.&#8221; He&#8217;s a pretty laid back guy.
	Anyway, despu&#233;s del reuni&#243;n, I got to hang out with los muchachos for a little bit. Got a small group together, Auri (miss outgoing), Mike, Thayer (como la calle en Providence!!!!), Eliza, Mella, Salvy, Ashley, Dana, Elsey, and a few others. Anyway, camin&#225;bamos por las calles, we went into a centro comercial, got some caf&#233; which was VERY strong, and I bought a child&#8217;s version of &#8220;Don Quijote de la Mancha.&#8221; Oh, snap. I&#8217;ll have pictures of some of this in a bit. Also, note, I&#8217;ll upload CTY pictures when I have time. Jeez, on the second day there are already couplybits going on! It&#8217;s nuts! I mean&#8230;teenagers we are, but necesitamos couple off so soon? Anyhoo, my opinion stands that most of the kids here are most definitely de calidad CTY. OOH! And los autobuses aqui son excellentes. Very fancy affairs, and they go exactly where I need them too. Plus the people are very nice&#8230;I had a pleasant conversation, if un poquito despacio, with this middle aged guy who lives in my neighborhood. I found my way home the very first time, tambi&#233;n! I didn&#8217;t get lost once. I&#8217;m very proud of that.
	Dinner era excellente, calamares y lomo de cerdo. Damnit, I&#8217;m developing a taste for all of these kosher foods &#9786;. From talking to the other kids today, I gather that the food and the conversation in their houses is not as good as here. I&#8217;m becoming more and more grateful for mi situaci&#243;n by the minute. I had a great full speed conversation about Zaragoza with mi madre&#8230;I&#8217;m very happy with my progress, even over the course of two days. Imagine what my Spanish will be like in nine months! I get into a groove and, with the exception of some vocabulary, I can communicate with much facilidad en espa&#241;ol. Mis padres de los EEUU called today. They apparently miss me a lot. Meh. Maybe I&#8217;ll miss them later ::shrug::
	My spell check hates me. There really needs to be a &#8220;Spanglish&#8221; option in the languages menu. Vale, my first full day of school is tomorrow, and I have a bunch of placement tests to take. Hasta luego, chicos!"

"event","Primero         
	Went to bed the night before the big trip way way way demasiado tarde. Woke up a few hours later at 9:45, having to leave at noon for the new land dubbed the Old World, headed to rejewishize the land of la reconquista and the inquisition. Still had a lot of packing to do at that point, so I did it while Bonnie got a nice book with pictures of RI for a present for la nueva familia. Two of the hardest goodbyes, then, to my perro, Astra, and Shan, mi gato favorito&#8230;posiblemente mi animal favorito. Certainly along with Astra my favorite living things in the house. In fact, the only actual picture I took with me (not counting all the ones on my computer) was of Astra, when she was a bit younger. I remember my mom stood to the side of me holding a treat up in the air so Astra would sentarse and pose for the picture. The ride to JFK was extremely short compared to what we had expected, so I arrived plenty early to worry about my new family, my new friends, mi nueva idioma. Needless to say, I first got to the airport reasonably apprehensive. Made the rounds more or less with the kids que ya estaban. I made a good first impression, which I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of these days, oddly enough. Fancy that, a personable Baruch. Pues, una chica who was EXTREMELY striking came around. Not stunning physically or anything like that, her personality was just extremely out there. No era overly talkative or too cheery&#8230;just extremely memorable. Tambi&#233;n, habl&#233; con una chica que estoy SEGURO que ya hemos conocido. I&#8217;ve seen her somewhere, and I&#8217;m not sure where. She agrees&#8230;we ruled out Model UN because she only goes to Montreal with her school&#8230;not CTY either. Hm. And a pair of girls out of texas who are very nice. In fact, I don&#8217;t think I met a single person there who I didn&#8217;t find it perfectly pleasant to be around. One of the guys is mildly sketch, and a couple of the girls are un poco ditzy, but all in all I think they&#8217;re going to be an excellent group of people to spend the year with. OH, AND I MET A CTYER THERE. She was wearing a 2003 staff shirt. That is all on the people front.
	So after a while waiting in our little corner of la aeropuerto, we moved over towards seguridad. I had a box of cheez-its with me, and, claro, I had to put it through the x-ray machine. Radiation soaked cheez-its in hand, I walked towards what I know now to be a three hour wait. Most of which was spent standing in a long line waiting for information as to the status of the airplane. Hah, I forgot to mention when I said goodbye to dad and Bonnie. I guess it shows you about how important an event it was to me.
	So: el vuelto. Era LONGASS. Usualmente, I can sleep on anything: trains, planes, automoviles, you name it. For some reason this was not the case, and the seven or so hours seemed their actual length, and then some. Because I slept JUST enough to feel like it was a couple hours later when en realidad it was only a few minutes. Gar. Pero I had a nice conversation with said outgoing girl, who seems to be interested in a lot of the same aspectos de ling&#252;&#237;sticas that I am. Coolness. Es interesante, porque posiblemente va a mover con su familia a Boston como yo. Made good use of my brand new iBook, thanks to the sudden death of the old&#8230;MUY ANTIGUO, Powerbook G3 that my dad had used for a while. I remember one day in something like sixth grade getting really excited about how new it was with the late Eric Jacober. He, and this will seem obvious for those of you who knew him, of course flaunted his knowledge of electronics in praising this great piece of technology. So that gives you a sense of how old it was.
	Wow, I&#8217;m good at this getting off track business. So after an extremely long ride, we arrive in Madrid. We didn&#8217;t see much more than the airport, as we unloaded our bags directly from the luggage conveyor to el cami&#243;n, y fuimos al autob&#250;s para our newest trip: the four hour ride to Zaragoza. That one was a lot shorter, as I was able to sleep almost all the way. The little I was awake for was a bit disappointing: lots of barren rocks. Quite deserty, actually. We stopped for lunch along the way, which is what made the trip four hours instead of three, and I had paella y una tortilla. It really wasn&#8217;t very good, and I&#8217;m quite glad now that all Spanish food isn&#8217;t of the same quality as that little rest stop. Spoke to this girl who I understand is from Korea, goes to school at a boarding school in the US, and is now taking a year of that and going to Spain. Jeez.
	So we&#8217;re within a couple kilometers of Zaragoza. It looks like the least interesting town in existence. Lots of squat apartment buildings, and one cathedral in the middle. That&#8217;s it. No skyline whatsoever, no surrounding greenery, nada. It all seems sort of depressing, this being the place where I&#8217;m going to be living for six months. Sorry about all the tense changes, but I like living in the moment when it isn&#8217;t actually the moment. Funny thing about that.
	We arrive to see the families a little while later, and I was nervous as hell along with everyone else. Would my family be full of smokers? Would they have a hard time understanding &#8220;Soy al&#233;rgico a los frutos secos y a los cacahuetes?&#8221; So I get there, am chosen as one of los chicos altos y fuertes, and help get all the extremely heavy baggage off the truck. I drag out my share, and when I finally find my own baggage we&#8217;re organized into groups, with whom we&#8217;ll be the rest of the year as advisory clusters. Our advisor is Ana, the school secretary, who seems like a perfectly nice lady in her 30s. Didn&#8217;t get much chance to talk with her, though, as we were soon sent towards the main attraction: the crowds of older men and women with little kids or older sons and daughters, with sisters and brothers and aunts and uncles, none of whom spoke una palabra de ingl&#233;s. Vale, dos o tres palabras, como &#8220;Cheekehn.&#8221; I was introduced by Ana to my new family, this youngish couple and what seemed to be a sister.  Besos a los tres, y a minute passes before Ana approaches me and asks &#8220;You are Frahnk?&#8221; I say yes, and she points to the sheet. Frantz, it says. More than a slight bit of embarrassment to go around before I get to meet my real family: A short, oldish couple, both slightly rotund, and what seems to be their son and daughter, Mario y Elena. I&#8217;m introduced as &#8220;Barooch,&#8221; which is easily as close as any of the American students got, and I find out that it&#8217;s Mario y su novia, and Elena is in Bronchales, en el sur de Arag&#243;n province, getting set up for the first week of elementary school there. She teaches the wee ones. Conversation is slightly strained as we head to the car, but I make do and eventually get m&#225;s c&#243;modo with the small talk en espa&#241;ol. We drive the two kilometers or so back to la casa, and I&#8217;m again slightly disappointed. It looks perfectly nice from the outside, really, sans the incredible amount of graffiti on all the houses in the neighborhood. Once again, I judged too early. The inside of the house is muy bonita, a small middle class deal. It has a BEAUTIFUL porch in between the first and second floors, with flowers and all. I&#8217;ll be posting pictures of the house, so there ends my description. Except for the garden. This, really, is the centerpiece of the house, even though it&#8217;s outside. Mi familia grows EVERYTHING. They have una granja peque&#241;a, tambien, outside of the city, but even in this small little jard&#237;n they have so much. Vines above you grow hundreds of grapes, pots grow herbs like lavender, mint, parsley, and several others I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out. They grow tomates, pepinos, melocotones, guisantes, y everything else. They have hens, as well, out at their farm, as well as an orchard. It seems as if they work ceaselessly to make this garden work, and their work pays of so, so much. Every meal has fresh fruit&#8230;oh God, the meals. I capitalized God, for once, so this must be important. Everything is homemade, everything is perfectly fresh, every meal is better than the next, which was itself the best meal I&#8217;ve ever had. Paella con gambas y pollo, homemade tortilla de patata y de varias verduras, mejillones y almejas con a little bit of mayonesa (which I&#8217;d always thought I&#8217;d hated with EVERYTHING), y a veces bombones y siempre frutas del jard&#237;n de postre.
	We have a cat, named Pecas, who seems very sweet. Pictures of Pecas and everything else to come. I went to bed bastante temprano, porque I hadn&#8217;t slept well enough in days. Woke up quince horas later, got myself a little bit of leche, y went out exploring with Jos&#233; Antonio (mi pap&#225; nuevo. We walked over to this parque cerca de la casa, which is pretty big, and has a library and this amphitheater thing where bands can perform and there are dances on weekends. This week there&#8217;s a fiesta celebrating la independencia de Arag&#243;n or something like that. They have carnival rides and prizes and a huge stand marked &#8220;COWBOYS&#8221; que has these automated bulls which you get on and ride. Everything looked like quite a bit of fun, including and especially the bumper cars.  There was a parade which came through, marching bands and people on stilts and guys in drag and dancers and people in Spanish looking hats and costumes, and one guy who tried talking to me in extremely slurred Spanish, beer in hand. There are lots of quite attractive people around here, so hurrah. No, that was not related to the guy with the beer. Anyway, we then moved on.
	I encountered an SYA girl with her family in the park, said &#8220;Oye,&#8221; as I passed, and Jos&#233; Antonio had the obligatory chuckle and nudge and &#8220;Es muy guapa, &#191;no?&#8221; before I had us move on towards Calle La Milagrosa, and home. After another superb meal, we went back towards one of the boulevards to see la &#8220;Milla,&#8221; apparently a running competition. Lots of middle aged guys and young chicas running in circles, which, as interesting as it was, seemed a hell of a lot less compelling than another walk through the park. I did meet some friends of the family though, who spoke much much faster than I was used to, and made my Spanish ability seem slightly less than superb. There was this particularly gorgeous girl who, I admit, I was ogling for a bit before I looked away and later made eye contact for a moment before turning back to the race. Afterwards, I met a friend of Angelines, mi madre, y the friend&#8217;s daughter, who teaches ingl&#233;s en una escuela en Barcelona. Claro, it was gorgeousgirl. It was MUY raro hablar en ingl&#233;s, because I&#8217;d been only communicating in Spanish for a couple days. I seem to forget which language I&#8217;m speaking in, until I&#8217;m forced to speak the other right away. Anyway, I really should be getting to bed now. &#161;Buenas noches! Thanks for reading all of this, it means a lot that you&#8217;re taking an interest. Especially since this thing is damn long."

"event","Hola, chicos! So yeah, this is my first Spain post, even though I haven't left for Spain yet. I'm leaving on a jet plane from JFK tomorrow night at 10, I think. I'll be posting pictures and thoughts and all sorts of fun stuff here, if you're interested in my year in Zaragoza. Not much else to say for now...I'm nervous and excited and pretty much everything else.

That's my address, so you can write if you'd like. Or send care packages, preferably not consisting of explosives. Or hate mail, or something. So, hasta luego, and next time I post it'll be from across the ocean!"

"event","So i'm FINALLY done with my A.P.Psychology exam! WOOOOO go me! its such a releife to be done! Its kinda like a big weight off my shoulders. it felt so good i had to get ice cream! me, sarah, kayla, amanday and mellissa went to khops after to indulge and rejoyce for having been done offically with a.p. psychology tests. yay! We still have some paketeering to do, but for the most part we have nothing to do but watch movies unitl the end of the year. rock on. 
    so i'm supposed to be doing my econ presentation, but i just don't feel like it. i don't care that its gonna be late, i really don't at this point. all together now, senioritis! 
    I am however currently working on my present to everybody for graduation. i have to tell you all i hope you appreciate it, cause it sucks! i've been doing it for like 3 hours and i'm still not done with this part. ITs all good though, cause its gonna be PHAT when i'm done. remember that word phat? i think we should bring it back. it could make a perfect addition to my list of words that are fun to say. i also think we should start saying solid again, just cause, but we can talk about that after we add phat to our vocab again. one at a time you know. Toodles

brignoles are here! to keep my mind off things! and i played like 8 rounds of solitare against joe..and a bunch of round sof poker too. it was great i had alot of fun. but hes not gunna be here this weekend..i was really counting on him..and bridgy cant come anymore..gah...was gunna be great...

"event","i have come to the conclusion that even though i wasnt satified with the camera i hhad chosen given my begetary limits...i not have to limit myself even more. i cant get the one i want for as cheap as my dad will pay for it. soo..its back to the drawingboard. i am so sick of reading reveiws and comparing cameras. there is no such thing as the perfect camera and every one has its flaws. but those flaws tend to piss me off. and seeing the cameras i could get getting piss me off even more. i dont no what im going to do. i dont no what i want. i dont no what i want to do either. which is another problem. my mom keeps asking me if iw ant a party or anything..i kinda feel like i should be celebrating a little more. but who am i supposed to invite. in order to have a good party you need to have your guests happy and a party at my house including maybe 5 people will not keep anyone entertained. parties are to stressful too. i could never deal witht hat shit.i dont wnana be stressing about my birthday. im already stresed enough about my godamn present. *sighs* my birthday is on a <b>monday</b>. a fucking monday!!! a BIOLAB MONDAY. onethat storm will probly be working...and my mom said well you can celebrate it on the weekend. id love to..but its not the same. i cant see anyone takeing me seriosuly when i tell them, ""shut up its my birthday"" just kidding..but thats kinda what i was pictureing in my head. i woudlnt even be able to convince mylself. though, i was also thinking, it could be like a practice birthday, so if anythign goes wrong we can jsut say, eh..its not really your birthday, well try again on monday. which is a good and bad thing. thats the reason i think it would go wrong. cause i myself and no one elts would really care enough to make it a good day. not liek it will even be any more special of a day. i dont have anything to do..maybe me and storm can go to breakfast. OH YEA! we cant. i forgot about the whole monday thing for a second there. gagh.. i realy did think that maybe i should plan some thing..like some sort of specail thing that will make this, my 16th birthday stick out in my memory, but i can think of anything. 

i cant concentrate. my fucking brother and his fucking friend are down here..i only get to go on when hes eating. he seems to be done. he makes me turn my music down, so he can yell and argue over my music. god!!! i am angry."

<a href=""http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/kodak-easyshare-dx6490-reviews.html#professional_reviews"">camera</a>

-or-

a bunch of cd and t shirts and little things.

kkay you may see me as insane for even debating this, but heres the thing. if i were to get the camera i want. the expensive gift, i would feel extreme pressure to use it..not saying i wouldnt use it..its just that would be insane pressure on me to <i>do good things with it</i>. dont question me, just go with it. the cameras i want..are kinda..good. like i feel they are too good for me. seeing as i am not good, i dont intend to make this my future, just fun. but i wont be settled with a more ""just for fun"" camera like the one i already have. i dont no. i just.....really want that camera. i really think i subcontiously long to make it a big part of me, but feel i cant. so getting this camera is therefore a bad idea. a bad bad bad..i want it so muhc. 

so on the other han di have a list of cds i need..so i coudl be happy with those perhaps..
-seether
-staind
-cold
-tool-opiate and salival
-finger eleven
and the first endo one..
and i could use some new band tshirts since i no longer listen to the music on pretty much all mine rite now..

see im gettign so muhc more money out of my parents going the camera way. its sick to say, but noing i could be gettign a 300 dollar camera..and just settling for 100 or so dollars worth of cds na dtshirts would be kinda depressing. and i really want a camera. okay. this is stupid. im gunna go for it. ill totally use it and i no it. *sighs* just ahve a bad feeling."

"event","my nasty white shirt that caused my first bad day after a block of unusually good days was destroyed in the laundry. its like i wasnt trusted to never wear it again. as if me saying never again wasnt good enough, it had to make sure it was compuletly <i>unwearable</i>. its weird too cause i was dissapointed. meaning it was right. i would have tried to wear it again. its odd how that worked out.

i want to frame it and whenever i even think about changing my style or looking nice, look at it for warning."

i just want him to be here right now. i want him to just hold me and tell me everything will be okay. iwhs he still read these. then maybe hed make the effort to help me an talk to me. caus ei cant do it. the fac tthat i feel so responsible when i bring up problems and he ends up mad or something..i just cant bring myself to do it.  

i wish i was strong. i want to be storng enough to deal with my problems, and <i>not</i> look to him to solve them for me all the time. just like i want to not lok to my mom to get me out of uncomfertbale situations and my dad to make phone calls for me... i want to be strong. i want to be able to handle myself, then therefore be in more control of my life. right now, i dont run my life. the events in my life run it. thats not the way it should be. <i>i </i>should run the events in my life and <i>i </i>should determine whats going to make me cry, and what will make me happy or feel good abut myself.

i dont see my psychologist for another 2 weeks cause of the damn snow. i feel like a complete fuck up by saying that is really bothering me. i dont even leave the place feelign like it helped, but i look foreward to it like shell just suck up all my problems stresses and concerns and replace them with something more comfortable. i live days by thinking well ill tell her about it..but then i remind myself, uhm what good will that do? i guess its better caus eim on my period now so id probly end up crying or something..those florescent lights in the office intensify tears..so much."

"event","i am discusted with myself. im back to crying all the time. ive had a good couple of days. i felt it coming today too with this huge emotional urge to be with storm all of a sudden. those kinds of uncontrollable urges (thogh that one wasnt a bad one) are not a good sign. science was terrible. apparently mr harrington had turned to me to make erin mikan do work casue he cant find many people that can work with her and i let him down 100%. we did nothing. i sat the whole class and freaked out about how i will get this donw. i can t handle that zero. i cant do that i am so embarrased. so he made me stay after and tryed to talk to me but i started crying and my face got so red i really dont think its ever been redder..now i have to do it on my own, present it on my own for a grade of my own. can it get much worse??! i dont no what im going to do!! i have no idea. math was pretty bad too casue i was still trying to get over that deal, then me and storm didnt make a good goodbye undoubtedly as a result of my stress. he just doenst understand. i dont no how to make him understand. its just so hard. holy shit i feel so misunderstood. i am. he doesnt understand at all. whatever i say just makes me out to be some uptite bitch who cares more about school than him. <font size=10>its not that.</font> not at all. i have a <b>problem</b> right now that he cannot comprehend. mostly because i cant explain it. i dont no why its ahppening. i dont no what to do about it but it is ruining me. it is making me miserable. but it doenst have to be this way!! if hed just try to see form my point of veiw..and respect me and my needs and just <b>try</b> a little harder to understand, it wouldnt casue all this <big>shit</big>. i see his point of veiw. i see why hes mad, but thats not helping us at all!! the way for us to get through this is for him to accept it!! or if he absolutly refuses it than at least help me. try and figure out what to do <b>with me</b> instead of expecting me to do it all on my own. i need him. i ned him so bad right now.i need him to help me through this. but hes not listening. hes not listening to me. 

and storm. please dont get mad at me when you read this, and decide you're going to hold a grudge. plesae jsut help me. i just need you to not hold a grudge on me. i need you."

"event","my period is coming.i feel it. i could start bawling right now as if the world was ending and everyone i loved was dying in from of my eyes if youwanted me to. so eyah.i know it wasnt that big of  deal. obviusly it wasnt. it was jsut i was realyl stressed after no knowing what ever doing all day and then find out at th elast nminute, not have things be my way, both of us be in a negative mood, i was uncontrollably stressed about a bunch of things no even worth writing about. and still am. i cannot calm down. last night i had this too. an unnerving feeling like i coudlnt keep still and i coudlnt get comfertable i coudnt stop sighing and i was just complelty adgitated to the point i accually wanted to go to sleep during that movie. and i did and storm said i twitched in my sleep. whihc is rather unusaual for me cause to our knowledge ive never done that before. though its rare that im asleep and hes not. so i dont no. i need some anti anxiety pills.

oh an di found like a big family sized package of zoloft trials under my moms cabinet today. i swear to god they could so spare them an di coud quit seeing this lady and be happy. maybe throw in some of those little yellow ones i get when i have panic attacks that make you relax. oh god i wish i knew where those were. then again.... im glad i dont."

if that line really was ironic, and not just sucky suck suck...then you would understand why i said it. me and storm. we seem to go back in the most ironic of ways. when im not dependant, he is. when i need him to death and feel like i cant be awake if i dont no what hes doing or when he wants to see me, he is too busy. were back to the beginingg...no not he begining. its just kinda what ive been associating with the begining lately, casue i barely remember the period when we both needed each other equal. the begining has kindachanged to the longest most painful therefore most memorable period when i needed him in order to breathe and he had to fit me into his schedual. and im afraid were back. i want to go to sleep. becaus ei odnt no what hes doing. but im going to be under such torture tomorrow cause i dont no when hes working, the chances of him clalling me in the morning and telling me we can do something are like nothing, and i probly will have no idea what hes doing or where he is till like dinner time tomorrow. i cannot dealw ith even the thought of that right now. i am freaking out right now. i have a problem. i cnat relax anymore. never. i am a terrible person for it an di feel like im going to explode with emotion.i think ive pinpointed it to a name too. OCPD. not OCD. obsessive compulsive personalitly disorder. the only thing it has to do with ocd is it is a less intense version of the problems and emotios. ocd is where your mmind gets caught up in a <i>complustion</i>, such as washing your hands. due to an <i>obsessive</i> uncontrollabe emotion such as fear of germs. your mind makes you have to repeat the motion over and over again even though you know your clean. your not insane, its as if you mind gets stuckin  loophole. OCPD is (def) a personality pattern that involves a preoccupation with rules, schedules, and lists; perfectionism; an excessive devotion to work; rigidity; and inflexibility.
explains my need to be on time. my need to do homework. my analness when storm doesnt focus (and you have no idea the immense stress it puts on me. i cannot even explain it.)my ""uptiteness"". my devotion towrds school, my respect for elders. i have an 8 page printout that i have so far decifered the first page using dictionary.com and a highlighter, and im convinced. 

and i am not a hypchondriac. if i were, i would have diagnosed myself with OCD which is what i first looked up and what lead me to OCPD. 

idk. if iifnish ;decoding the article and still am conviced, then ill dealw ith it. though of course theres no medication for it. just wonderful. 

i need to be put out of my misery. 




and by that i just meant sleep."

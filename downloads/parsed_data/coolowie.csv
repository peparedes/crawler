"event","man, i drank more beer than i think i ever have in my entire life this weekend.  sunday morning i woke up and just felt like i had gained about 20 pounds of pure flab.  one of those times where you just want to lay around on the couch and go ""uhhhhhhhhhhh"" all day and watch tv.

it's always funny to me to go back to the ranch bowl, no matter how long in between visits, it's the same thing, same people.  but it was fun.  honestly i don't remember much of the show, but i remember seeing people i haven't seen forever and missing them.  the 2 minutes and 30 seconds or so i was on stage are a complete blur.  i honestly don't remember it at all, i don't know how i remembered how to play hobo joe, so i'm sure it sounded AWESOME.  but oh well, no pain no gain.  

in other news, school starts again next week and i'm really stressed.  i'm taking 3 classes and trying to work full time too.  it's going to be really rough and it's times like this where i kinda need some kind of release again.  something creative i can do to burn off some energy and not be so strung out all the time.  I have a couple of musical ideas...i have talked to a couple of people about starting a fun, not serious band that would practice once a week, maybe play once a month.  i have also talked about starting a....get ready for this....a cover band.  that's right, a cover band.  i think it'd be fun, i could make a few bucks on the side to support my meth habit.

that's all for now, i kinda have a case of the ""mondays"", so excuse the drab tone of this post.  i'll try and make it a little more lively next time."

"event","man, 3 fucking days in a row, how about that....
i've been listening to this cd-nativity in black, a tribute to black sabbath the last couple of days, and it still kicks ass.  i got it in high school when i first started getting into heavy music.  they have made a sequel to it since then, but i haven't heard it yet.  it was kinda interesting listening to it, because i haven't in about 5 or 6 years probably, and i heard a lot of songs that i subconciously borrowed ideas from when i used to play in 8th Wave.  i think pretty much every band, whether they know it or not, is somehow influenced by black sabbath, even ""gay ska"".
summer kinda sucks for me lately because i've really gotten addicted to tv and there's nothing really new on.  the last ""shield"" was on last night, adn the sopranos is over for like two years, so all i have is last comic standing to keep me occupied, oh yeah, and beavis and butthead reruns i tape each week!

more later!

"event","I've become quite the kevin smith fanboy lately.  i got into his movies starting with clerks because when it came out i was working at a concession stand at a pool, and had to deal with questions very much like the douches that randall and dante have to deal with.
for instance, we had hot dogs for $1.50, and polish dogs for $2.25.  the polish dogs were much bigger than the hot dogs, but they're fucking POLISH DOGS, so they are worth more, duh.  
so one day this girl comes up and looks at the board and says ""2.25??  shee-at, how y'all gonna charge $2.25 just to polish a fuckin hot dog?""
similar to this was a time that i worked at super kmart.  they had this icee kiosk that was frequently left unattended, pissing off a barrage of unfriendly motherfuckers when they wanted an icee.  so one day this thing has a line of about 5-10 people who are getting really impatient, and we can't find the girl that's supposed to run the thing.  The ringleader of this horde is stomping around, acting pissed, yelling at everybody, when the icee girl finally shows up.  she apologizes, tells him she fell in, whatever, to make him happy.  Then, the guy comes up to me as he's leaving, shaking his head, and says ""All she had was excuses!  When you go up to Wal-Mart, you don't get excuses, you get RESULTS!""
anyways, about kevin smith.  he was supposed to write/direct the upcoming green hornet movie, which i was excited about, but kind of dreading, because i was afraid he'd get away from what he's great at, his ""talkie movies"".  where guys sit around and bullshit about, well, working at kmart and polish dogs.  now he says he's pretty sure he won't direct, but will write the green hornet movie, and has a new movie that's been cast already, with a budget of only $250,000 and ""familiar faces"".  he says it will be more in line with his other stuff, which is awesome news for me.  BTW, i just saw jersey girl, which was really really good, nothing like his other movies, but still great, and if he can make a movie like this, he can pretty much do anything.
more later...."

"event","well, i decided that as much as i fight it, i DO want to be just like everybody else, so i went and got myself a live journal.  I don't have much to write about today, but i will make sure and write at least once a week.
nothing much is going on for me this week, just work and school as usual.  i'm taking two summer classes, right now i'm in engineering statics, which is like a physics class studying systems that do not move, like bridges, or um, picture frames, you know, important stuff.  so far i'm kicking ass at it, i have a 97%.  if i keep that up, i don't have to take the final.  after that i have differential equations, which is really gonna suck squeezed into five weeks.  but i'll be fine, don't you worry about me!
oh yeah, and i found a cool band that i downloaded, called ""h.i.m.""  they sound like type o negative with love song lyrics.  not the best band of all time, but definitely one of the most original i've heard in a while.
3 months till the clerks 10th anniversary dvd!"

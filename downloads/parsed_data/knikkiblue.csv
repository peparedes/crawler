"event","what do you do when the person you are falling for has cancer? and theres not the option of stopping liking him cuz you are beyond gone. further than you have ever been before. i see him and i cant help but get this big smile on my face. my friends say his name and im grinning for what seems like ages. i cry at his misfortunes and jump up and down *literally* at his joys. ive dont think i have ever felt like this before. small versions of this, yes. but nothing to this magnitude. and i have no clue what to do. things were going great until he went home.........    now after three weeks hes back, but hes leaving again. im so scared of what the tests are gonna say.   I wish i knew what to say to him to let him know how i feel. but i can barely put it into words for me to understand. all i know is ive fallen head over heels for this guy and i would do anything for him, and im gonna be a mess if the cancer starts taking his life. ::shudder:: I try not to think about that. i dont even want to know what would happen to me emotionally.   Ive always been told that all my heataches were just preparing me for the right one.   how do you know when the right one is in fact that??     do i keep holding on and just wait through this? do i let him know how i feel? or do i ignore my feelings and move on in life?     oh please God, give me a hint at to what your will is. I am so helpless right now....... i just need your guidance."

So for now Ill stand back and not say a thing, hoping youll notice and not give me a second glance. Ill stand and watch as they all flock and talk to you. Ill turn and talk to others so you wont think I was staring at you or wanting to talk to you. But can I really do those things? Can I just turn away? I dont think so. But what other choice do I have? None. I wont be one to try to get your attention, thats not me at all. I wish you knew me well enough to know this about me. But you dont. Cuz I dont know what to say to let you know."

I cried again last night. That seems to happen a lot whenever I talk to him. Or attempt to talk to him.  Gah! I cant believe he let a GIRL change him this much. One that keeps screwing him over. each time I really talk to him, things seem to be a lot better. but he keeps going back to her. I dont know what to do. Im tired of taking his crap but at the same time, hes my best friend, and im not about to ditch him just cuz things get rough..... man, i wish i knew what to do."

"event","I really don't know how to explain things with Ben. Basically he's just changed since Angel entered the picture, and not for the better. Jessie, Ive been trying so hard to like her cuz I know she means a lot to Ben, but its not working too well. Like last night we were driving home from Edgefest *which totally rocked!!!* and it took everything not to punch her in the face. Which is really sad, cuz I don't usually want to do that to people. Ben said that you called her a ""princess"" haha, thats great! She made some comment about it on the way home, and Ben just had to bring me in the conversation and ask me if I thought she was a princess too. Oh man, it took everything not to let loose with what I really think of her. I think she is a self centered, self absorbed, has to have everything she wants or she throws a tantrum like a two year old, bitch. Sorry, I had to get that out. IT doesn't help any that I know she doesn't like Ben and mines relationship, and it seems like shes doing everything she can to not let us be close friends and hang out alone. She like flaunts that she has him whenever Im around. Argh! And he doesn't seem to see how badly she really treats him and how much hes changed. I don't really feel like I can go to my best friend anymore when I need him, cuz I know she'll throw a hissy fit. And Im really tired of trying to be her friend, but Im gonna keep trying because it means a lot to him and Id do anything for him. Ok, sorry, Im done ranting. I just spent way to much time around her yesterday. I could keep going on, but I have a feeling Im getting redundant."

I hate this. i hate not knowing how you feel, i hate your mood swings! I swear you have PMS!!! you need to make up your mind, even if it means taking a HUGE risk. Cuz I know it will. Part of me wants to believe that you just are too afraid of me leaving..... and thats why you are doing this, but wait, that would be too easy. you piss me off only because i care about you. you have no clue what an effect your words have on me.

"event","<P>So I havent written in here in forever. The move went really well. Im enjoying living here a lot. Infact, Ive actually been thinking about staying.... Weird, I know. Ive been wanting to go to SNU for years and Ive just been waiting for the past two years, and now I kinda want to stay. I know if I stay I could make some big bucks. all these families have been calling me wanting me to babysit, and I get paid $10/hour! But I know that God wants me at SNU, so Im gonna go and see how things go. Its gonna be so hard though. Cuz even though I know a lot of people up there, Im gonna miss certain people a LOT. Like Ben, man we have been through so much together. Everything with Angel has been really hard on me and i didnt realize until today how hard its been on him too, me not liking her and stuff. Then theres always Nathan.......... good-ness. I have no clue what to do with or about that boy! I love the guy so much, but at the same time he frustrates me beyond all belief. Ive been spending a lot more time with him since we got back from Lubbock. What a trip! I was floating on cloud nine, until we got home and he decided to be a looser. ""You know it would never work"" ""We're too different."" I know we're different!!! Do you honestly think I could handel being with a person like me??? No way! But whatever. It seems like everytime we're together things are perfect, but then when I leave, reality hits. Like when we were at the pool and Starbucks the other night; it was great, especially the hug goodbye.......&nbsp; *dreamy smile* but then I got in my car and remembered ""oh hey! hes with Charissa...."" Not anymore, but still. Its like I can never just be happy with him. Which i guess is ok since Im leaving soon and I dont want to be attached my first semester of college.... but it still is really hard. Hes gotten to be such an amazing person. When we went out during school I always thought how much better things would be if he just quit his habbits and got God in his life. I was right. He is amazing. We can just sit around and joke for hours, he constantly keeps a smile on my face, and hes gotten to be really sweet. Even when he gets in one of his moods *which is rare now* he realizes it and becomes more enjoyable. Ben has tickets to the Rangers game on Friday, which he told me I could go to. Then at lunch he said i cant go without a date. Which I know means Nathan. So i guess Ill be asking him tonight if he wants to go... Gah! Part of me wants him oh so badly, but then another part is too scared to risk it. I just now honestly looked at my feelings and i dont see a single part NOT wanting to be with him. Which is way wacked out! *haha had to put some funny stuff in ;-)*&nbsp; I just want him so bad......... and it terrifies me. I dont want to feel this way, but it wont stop. Doesnt help any that I live with his brothers girlfriend, and that hes so amazing now. </P>
<P>Then theres the whole Kevin thing....... I dont know. I missed him while he was gone. I really missed talking to him that is. But now that he's back....... theres just nothing there. at all. The first night we hung out after he got back, he was just grating on my nerves! :-( I dont even know why. Probably since I had just gotten back from Tech and had Nathan on the mind. I feel bad, cuz I know Ive put Kevin through a lot this summer, even though i never ment to. I think I was ust trying to make something that wasnt really there happen. Hes an awesome guy, but not for me. I had hoped that he would realize that things are no longer there, but when I was at Jeffs a lil bit the other night, I realized that that is not the case. So I need to go clear things up. Oh I hope I dont&nbsp;hurt him :-/&nbsp;</P>
<P>I also need to find a counselor to go to. I think Im gonna go crazy one of these days..... </P>
<P>Ok, thats enough. Now Im gonna get ready cuz I get to go see the amazing Nathan tonight *giddy smile, with a nervous look in my eye*</P>

"event","I found the picture on my Xanga while searching for stuff on line. I really like it because it reminds me to always thank God for everything he brings me. Lately things have been really rough for me, but through my amazing friends he has shown me to be thankful and have a willing heart for I know not what my future holds. People keep telling me that what I go through is put before me not to make me stumble but to make me stronger. Ive turned away from God lately, but he has shown me that he hasnt left. Thank you to everyone who has offered a word of encouragement and a prayer. Im not in the clear yet, but Im working on it. Satans been working hard to pull me from my true Father that loves me unconditionaly. All I have to say is NOT GONNA HAPPEN! I am learning humlity and learning that I cannot handel everything myself. For the first time in a long time I actually am having to go to others for help. Something REALLY hard for me. For those of you who are going through a rough time in life, turn to God and allow him to direct your path, for he will never fail you!

"event","I am so freaking emotionaly drained. It sucks majorly. Everything with Ben is taking a LOT out of me. :( Gah! I just want him to be happy, but i cant help but feeling like Im taking that away from him..... Maybe I just need to leave him and Angel alone and stuff, back completely out of the picture.... but I dont think I could handel that. I cant just bail on the best friend Ive had in a long time just cuz things get a little rough... Things have changed though, and I know this. They will never go back to the way they were before which sucks beyond all belief! O crap, here I go again. I wish the tears would stop. I hate this so fucking much!!!!!! Ive lost my best friend. No matter how many times he apologizes and no matter how many times I talk to Angel and try to like her, things are just fucked up now, and they cant be completely fixed. Its like when you drop a crystal vase. No matter how much you want it fixed, and no matter how much super glue you use, or how much time and effort you put into fixing it, it will never be as beautiful and wonderful as it once was. And it tears at my heart. It figures that the one person I could always count on, disapointed me. Just goes to show that ppl arent perfect. I want so much to hate Angel for all of this. Is she had fucking stayed away......... But I know I cant, its not her fault. And truthfully I know it wont make me feel any better. Man, I was trying so hard to not give Ben such a hard time about her cuz I knew he really liked her. And what happens? Freaking bites me in the ass! And to top it off, I had/have no fucking clue how to deal with this, so Im sure Ive made things worse by the way Ive treated him. Christina warned me not to make him choose, which is good advice. Not only would it not be fair to him, I truthfully am scared to know who he would choose.....:-/ Maybe thats what is killing me the most. Why is this happening? Was I that crappy of a best friend? I hate this! I hate that I had been so busy. I hate that I just gave in because I didnt want him to be mad at me. I hate that Ive lost my best friend. That is why it is 2:37am and Im working and writing this. I cant sleep, I know what my nightmares are gonna be about again. I wonder if he ever really knew how much of an impact he had on my life. How I wouldnt have been able to deal with half the shit if he werent there for me. How much better life was knowing that I always had him no matter what. He was the best friend I could have ever asked for. And now......... now thats not there anymore. :( How is it that this seems to hurt more than losing Adam????"

I've come to the conclusion that my puppy is the coolest ever!!! Freaking guys need to take lessons from Koda. Heres why:
~He is ALWAYS happy to see me
~He is always willing to give me a kiss 
~Even when he wakes me up for breakfast, he's nice about waking me up, and then lets me go back to sleep
~He's fun to snuggle with
~He can play rough, and have fun, but he knows when its time to calm down
~He'll sit and watch the rain with me :-)
~He listens

Ok I think thats enough"

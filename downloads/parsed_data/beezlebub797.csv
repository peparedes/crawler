"event","AHHHHHHHHHHHHH, I'M 18!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wow, so today was totally awsome. It started at 6:15 in the morning, I had to wake up and straighten my hair because otherwise it's all poofy like and stupid looking. Then I drove to school and dropped my car off around 6:45 because I was going out to breakfast with Brandon, Alana, Hannah, and Andrew. Andrew drives up and starts circling my car with his car and he keeps circling and circling around. When I get out of my car, he drives away, and then spins around and drives right up to me and opens the door. A bunch of balloons fall out (which I later counted and there are 11 balloons) and he says that he was pretending to be a shark and attacking me. Then he tells me that I can look at my present, but I can't have it yet, so I looked in the bag he was pointing to, and it's a partially knitted scarf. He said that he took some lessons or classes or something on how to knit and that he was knitting me a scarf for my birthday :) Then we drive to Millie's and we go in and sit down, once everyone is there, he says that he has to go to the bathroom. We all order our food and are talking when all of a sudden, our waitress comes out holding a coffee cake with a candle on it. She comes to our table and shouts out something like, ""EVERYBODY, TODAY IS ABI'S BIRTHDAY, LET'S ALL SING HER HAPPY BIRTHDAY"" and the whole restaurant sings Happy Birthday to me. As I'm trying to sink down into my seat, I hear the base that the candle's in playing Happy Birthday. I look over at Andrew and he's grinning, and I asked him ""Did you go back there and tell them that it's my birthday?"" and he said, ""No *still grinning* I went to the bathroom, what're talking about"". So after breakfast, we go back to school and he drops me off at the Crafts room and I knock on the door and Gavin comes out and blocks the door. He wishes me a happy birthday and hugs me and then lets me in the classroom. Andrew calls me to ask if the crafts room is open and when I said yes, he said, ""Well, then again, I think I'm going to sit here in my car and knit..."" So that is how Andrew made my day wonderful. I love that boy :)

Now, after all of these Andrew shannanigans, Meredith comes around and bangs on the crafts room door. I answer and she has a whole posse to help her carry everything she has for me. She got me a Winnie The Pooh Balloon, a Happy Birthday balloon, an oreo cake (delicious), and flowers. She says that they're from her and Lexie, but I know that she was the one who picked them all up and paid for them. That is how she made my day lovely.

AFTER all of the Andrew shannanigans, the Meredith treats time, Nicole busts into class late with a Safeway bag for me. She gives me the bag and I look inside of it and there's another balloon, a smaller one this time, and something wrapped in red plastic. I opened the plastic and it turned out to be YUMMY DELICIOUS chocolate chip cookies!!!!!!!!! She's too good to me that slag... That's how Nicole made my day awsome.

And throughout the day, I kept getting phone calls and texts from people to wish me happy birthday. Yesterday, Julien whips out a handful of change, and pulls out a Susan B. Anthony dollar coin and gives it to me ""to go buy myself something pretty"". He's so amusing... Tamara texted me during breakfast and that was just lovely :) Then we cross paths in the hallway, and she tells me to stop and whips out a bottle of Martinelli's Sparkling Cider (one of my favorite drinks that I like to steal from her house). Her quote from today, ""Well, I was going to take the label off, but then someone came up to me in the office today and asked if I had a bottle of alcohol, so I decided to keep the label on..."" I <3 TAMARA!!! Yar, so today at school was pretty awsome...

THEN, when I got home, my parents decided they wanted to take me out for a birthday dinner, so we went to the Japanese restaurant in Orinda. Afterwards, we came home and they gave me: a really nice horse pillow, two comic books (Fone Bone), the last two books in a series that they had given me over xmas (Ramses by Christian Jacq), The Corpse Bride, and The Pretender Season 3. This is on top of my new digital camera which is my big birthday present.

THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR EVERYTHING FROM THE PHONE CALLS AND TEXT MESSAGES TO THE BALLOONS AND CAKE AND FLOWERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Today was absolutely AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Oh what fun. The front end of my car is smashed up because I got into a car accident with two other cars. I was driving down Mt Diablo Blvd, going to get lunch, and this little old man decided to try and turn in front of me. Unfortunately, I was a couple of feet away from him when he decided to pull out in front of me, and I slammed on my brakes, but I hit him and another car. I took off his bumper, and then my car swerved because I lost control of the wheel and my glasses flew off, and then my car swerved into another car. Nobody is hurt though, that's the good part. Plus, the accident isn't my fault, so I don't have to worry about getting sued or anything. But my poor baby, little Bella is sitting in an auto body shop, waiting to be fixed.

100. Put out a plate of cookies at night. Tell your roommate that
they're for the Sandman. Take a bite out of one of the cookies while
your roommate is asleep. The next morning, accuse your roommate of
having bitten one of the cookies. If he/she tries to tell you the
Sandman did it, insist that you know what the Sandman's teeth marks
look like and that those are, in fact, not the Sandman's teeth marks.<br>
<br>
101. If your roommate has a pet, offer to feed their pet for them.
Start taking bottles of glue and white out from your desk before your
roommate can answer. <br>"

""Existentialism On Prom Night""

When the sun came up,
We we're sleeping in,
Sunk inside our blankets,
Sprawled across the bed,
And we we're dreaming,

There are moments when,
When I know it and
The world revolves around us,
And we're keeping it,
Keeping it all going,
This delicate balance,
Vulnerable all knowing,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, kill for this

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, you would...

Sing me something soft,
Sad and delicate,
Or loud and out of key,
Sing me anything,
we're glad for what we've got,
Done with what we've lost
Our whole lives laid out right in front of us,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, you would....

Sing me something soft,
Sad and delicate,
Or loud and out of key,
Sing me anything



""Stories""

I found a line and then it grew
I found myself still thinking of you
I felt so empty and now I'm fine
But still it's burning, when will you be mine?

[Chorus:]
Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think it's time for change, don't you?
Too much of the same stories in our lives
(I think it's time for us to walk away from here)

Stories in our lives, we keep them all inside [x2]

Look at me still in your mind
Our memories so intertwined
Well you broke through and found your way
And so did I no need to stay
The same old picture, tried and true
Been through there, let's look for something new

Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think it's time for change, don't you?
Too much of the same stories in our lives
(I think it's time for us to walk away from here)

[Chorus]

Do you remember lying on the beach so late at night
Do you remember running through the sprinklers that night
Do you remember all the songs that I have wrote for you,
All the songs that I have wrote for you
(For you)

I remember,the way you made me feel when I was with you
I remember,the smile that always brought me back to you
That look in your eyes, I never thought that this could be untrue [x2]

Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think it's time for change, don't you?
Too much of the same stories in our lives
(I think it's time for us to walk away from here)

(Untrue
Do do da da
do do da da
do do da da
do do da da
do yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus]



""You And Me""

What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time

Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here

Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

What day is it?
And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive


""Grand Theft Autumn (Where Is Your Boy) (Acoustic)""

When I wake up, I'm willing to take my chances on the hope I forget
that you hate him more than you notice I wrote this for you.

You need him. I could be him...
I could be an accident but I'm still trying.
That's more than I can say for him.

Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman.
Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of town.

Someday I'll appreciate in value, get off my ass and call you...but for the meantime I'll sport my
brand new fashion of waking up with pants on at 4:00 in the afternoon.

L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one i see
V is very, very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone that you adore can

Love is all that i can give to you
Love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it
Take my heart and please don't break it

Love was made for me and you

You take a while to fall in love with someone. Trust takes time.

You give and take equally in relationships.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>

With a birthday on the 15th of any month, you are apt to have really strong attachments to home, family and domestic scene. 
The 1 and 5 equaling 6, provide the sort of energy that makes you an excellent parent or teacher. 
You are very responsible and capable. 

This is an attractive and an attracting influence. 
You like harmony in your environment and strive to maintain it. 
You tend to learn by observation rather than study and research. 

You may like to cook, but you probably don't follow recipes. 
This number shows artistic leanings and would certainly support an talents that may be otherwise in your makeup. 
You're a very generous and giving person, but perhaps a bit stubborn in ways.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>"

"event","""A Dream Within A Dream""
    Edgar A. Poe

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow-
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand-
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep- while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save 
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?"

It's leather bound and I love it, it was my mommys, and before her, my mommy's great aunt :) So yes, last night was really fun, even though I died and am now extremely sore. Tamara, you know I want to lick out your brains...or your ear :) I'm currently burning a cd for Tamara (MSI) and reading poems from E.A Poe...

   ""Romance""

ROMANCE, who loves to nod and sing,
With drowsy head and folded wing,
Among the green leaves as they shake
Far down within some shadowy lake,
To me a painted paroquet
Hath been-a most familiar bird-
Taught me my alphabet to say-
To lisp my very earliest word
While in the wild wood I did lie,
A child-with a most knowing eye.

Of late, eternal Condor years
So shake the very Heaven on high
With tumult as they thunder by,
I have no time for idle cares
Through gazing on the unquiet sky.
And when an hour with calmer wings
Its down upon my spirit flings-
That little time with lyre and rhyme
To while away-forbidden things!
My heart would feel to be a crime
Unless it trembled with the strings."

This<br>allows you to stay in the water as much as<br>you'd like. In good purposes it can save<br>drowning victims. In evil purposes it can help<br>you drag down a person to the depths and have<br>them drowned. This power helps you escape the<br>world, if even for a bit, since you have grown<br>to despise it so much.<br>You have been a beaten dreamer with aspirations<br>crushed. Now you try to control your hopes<br>because you don't want to get hurt again. You<br>feel there is no hope for you in the future and<br>have no real goals. But unlike the Controller<br>of Time you do still feel, even if it's mostly<br>negative emotions. You have few friends, if<br>any, and feel you are unable to speak about<br>your troubles. And unlike the Transformer, you<br>don't feel happiness nowadays. All seems to be<br>filled despair whereever you go and you are<br>bitter becaue the world has failed you. It<br>didn't turn out the way you wanted it too and<br>you feel betrayed. It is also likely the<br>feeling of betrayal comes from past<br>relationships where you were left alone in the<br>end.<br><b>Negative aspects:</b> Since you are highly<br>depressed and not letting out your emotions<br>properly there is a possibility for cutting, to<br>let the emotions out. Also, if the feeling of<br>despair grows to strong you might consider<br>taking your life.</p>

Ugh, people are so annoying, they make me angry and I want to kill them!!!!!!!!!! Oh Tamara, we need to get away, go on a roadtrip together, maybe we should join the army together, that would be amusing. We'd be in boot camp, and then we'd randomly break out wrestling each other :) ARGHA, he makes me so fucking frustrated, but I know that if I could just get him alone and talk with him, I could sort a few issues that I need to talk to him about.

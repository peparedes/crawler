"event","I personally will remember ORBH for a long time to come.  One of the main reasons I will remember it is for the simple fact that it is so different than your typical class.  It seems like since so many classes are structured the same that they all seem to run together and none of them stick out.  If you don't remember the class then how are you supposed to remember what you learned?  The grading contract, learning plan and live journal were very unique things to have in a class.  The fact that the class was more focused on yourself instead of a bunch of equations or formulas makes it seem much more important.  I felt that the class was very rewarding and I think it should me a requirement for all undergraduate students at Case."

"event","Tuesday's session on coaching and mentoring was valuable because it is something that is done on a daily basis.  We are constantly either asking advice from other people, or helping people ourselves to deal with a certain situation.  A lot of the time this is going on even though we do not realize it.  I also think it is valuable to get an opinion from someone you do not know, because their opinion will be unbiased.  Since they do not know anything about you it sometimes will make it easier to be more truthful.  I did think it was awkward to have someone you don't know read your learning plan because they it is a very intimate and personal paper.  I did feel that it was still worth it to realize that a lot of the goals and dreams that you have for yourself are very similar to other Case students, which be very encouraging."

"event","I found today's class very important.  I feel that the evaluation process is an important process.  It is important for all of us to get feedback on our strengths and weaknesses in a team environment.  We are all going to be in teams in the future whether it be for a job or here at Case, so it is important for us to realize what we need to work on and what we are already good at.  I felt that my particular team has done a great job.  Everyone has worked hard throughout our project and we did not have any weak links.  I thought it was very useful to get direct feedback from another team member.  This had a lot to deal with the Chris Argyris article where he talks about how important it is for professionals to receive feedback and to not put blame on other people.  He said how professionals need to accept that they did something wrong instead of just saying it was someone else's fault.  The professionals usually put the blame on someone else because they feel that they are already competent at their jobs.  It is important for us to realize although we are have done a great job in our teams, it is crucial to receive feedback and determine what you need to work on in the future."

"event","The presentations on Thursday were great.  All of the four organizations seemed like very interesting places to get an internship and possibly a career.  I found the handout for the Gund Arena Company very interesting because it actually gave you an idea of how they hire people, and what they are looking for in their interns.  I thought the IMG presentation was probably the most interesting for me, mainly because it seems like such a fun place to work at.  The fact that they only accept 70 out of 1000 people for internships really tells you about the competitive nature of the company.  It was also nice to hear about Price Waterhouse Coopers since they are such a big recruiter of undergrads.  I also thought the fact that the CEO of National City Bank is a Case alumnus was pretty cool.  All of the presentations were very informative, and it actually made me want to hear more about the organizations.  I wish it was easy to find the information that was presented because this information can be so helpful while searching for a career."

"event","I also enjoyed the presentations.  I thought it was very interesting hearing about very diverse companies.  There was a nice contrast between a large organization like accenture and a smaller, entrepreneurial type organization like TGS.  There was also the contrast between the non-profit organizations and the for profit organizations.  All of the teams had a lot of useful information, that at times seemed overwhelming. The information I enjoyed the most was about the rewards and benefits.  Salaries for various employees of an organization are not easy to find out, so to be able to be given the information was pretty nice.  Good luck to all of the presenters on Thursday."

"event","I feel that the most important aspect of empowering is the fact that it can actually take the pressure off of the manager's responsibilities.  If a manager has to continuously assign tasks to their employees and evaluate their progress it can be very cumbersome because they have to always be looking over their employees shoulders.  If a manager can empower their employees then the manager can have more faith in the employees work habits.  I think it is important for an organization to be able to continue to run on an ongoing basis whether or not its CEO or other top managers are present or not.  The employees need to be capable of handling their own tasks as well as going above and beyond that and doing whatever is needed for the organization to keep running, and I think that is the key to empowerment."

"event","The long-term goals that I have in order to realize my dreams are important but not urgent.  The goals that I have set are in Quadrant II ( not urgent but important).  The goals are very important but there is a lot of preparation and planning that needs to be taken into consideration.  If I fail in the preparation and planning of my goals it is most likely that I will end up in Quadrant I (urgent but important).  This seems to be the last stage before goals can be completed.  Unfortunately if you end up in Quadrant I with your most important goals it may be too late.  Once in Quadrant I odds are that your long-term goals(which have now become short-term goals) will not be achieved to the quality that they need to be.  If your goals are not achieved to a high degree your dreams may not be realized at all, and if they are they may not be to the extent that you were hoping in the first place.  It is ok if your subgoals are in Quadrant I because they are just short barriers toward your long-term goals.  The most important aspect is to keep your long-term goals (such as a dream job, wonderful marriage, family health) in Quadrant II so you can keep yourself focused and prepared."

"event","The one thing that I noticed about my 25 dreams was that they all seem very related and interconnected.  The aspiration to own my own business and to be able to spend time with my family and friends when I want to compared to having to do everything on my boss's terms is motivation for me.  The other main dream of financial security and the ability to buy neat toys for myself like a nice car and a boat.  But while trying to formulate actual goals to accomplish my dreams it seemed that I could not come up with more than one concrete goal.  My dreams all seemed to be based one the idea of whether or not I can be successful with my career and therefore be able to buy what I want and spend valuable time with the people I care about.  Did anyone else feel that the outcome of whether their dreams would happen or not is based on career success?  Or could you accomplish your dreams regardless of your career?"

"event","I think LiveJournal has been very beneficial since you can receive and respond to questions that are brought up in class no matter what day or time it is.  I also think that after leaving class and you have had more time to think about what was discussed, and one is more able to respond with an even more meaningful and thoughtful response to the day's class.  It is also beneficial because you might have missed something during class, but on LiveJournal you can't miss anything because you can just go back and read the person's response over again.  I think the drawback maybe that it seems like a lot of the time it is people giving their opinion on an issue that sometimes may be separate from what other people have said, I don't think it is always an actual conversation that is taking place, just people randomly saying things that are on their mind.  I think the best way to get people to respond is to respond to other people's journals, so hopefully they will respond to yours.  I also think the standard for acceptable journaling is adequate.  The only change I could envision is for people that missed previous weeks of making journals could possibly have to have an extra comment or two from other people in the class to make up for it."

"event","Artifacts:  The main artifacts are the Juniper Residential College (JRC) logo that can be found on sweatshirts, the JRC news sheet, and the carving of the name Emma Raymond by the entrance.

Subcultures:  Subcultures exist between which floor you are on, the 2nd(women), 3rd(men), 4th(men).  There is also a subculture of the floors depending on which side of the bathroom you are on because each floor is divided by the bathroom.  Majors can be a subculture as well, because you will go to the people with the same major as you for help.  RA's and LA's are a subculture as well.

Values:  The most important value that exists is that everyone is willing to help everyone else with homework and studying, also with any personal problems that may arise.  Students also help other students while deciding what classes to take and what to major/minor in.  

Assumptions:  The main assumption is that the students that live in the dorm are first-year students, unless you are an RA or an LA."

"event","I personally feel that there is a never ending battle between a person's real self and their ideal self.  A person who strives continuously to succeed at everything they do may have an ideal self that is never attainable.  If a person constantly raises the bar of what they feel they are capable of, a sense of true accomplishment and happiness may never occur.  Instead of constantly striving to become your ideal self, one may need to accept their real self for what it is.  Instead of always wanting to be something bigger and better, a person may need to just fine tune a few extremely important things in their life and accept themselves for who they are.  If this can be accomplished a sense of true identity and peace will be in store."

"event","I feel that people who end up at the top of the ladder that is leaning on the wrong wall may not notice for a while.  The people who become very focused and driven on their goals and aspirations will sacrifice many different things such as important relationships and time with their family for these career goals.  Once a person is at the top of the ladder it may be too late to go back and fix certain relationships or bring back time that was lost.  It also may take a person a long time to realize they are on the wrong wall, and once they finally do it is simply too late.  Instead of going back and trying to fix past mistakes the only path would be to take what you have learned and apply it to relationships and events that are presented to you in the future.  A good way to accomplish this would be to take a few steps down the ladder and find more balance in your life."

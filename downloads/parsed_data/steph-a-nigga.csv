"event","So today school was stupid like always i hate it so much.
But I got to bowl again finally b.c im switching out of that stupid hard math class. I had fun today i saw bobby he makes me smile sometimes when hes nice.
I gave him my numbaaa. =X
But yeah so i was on the way home on the bus i was thinking about a lot of stuff. like Michael and everything we used to do and it made me sad =[
And how i like Sam a lot and i wish things would work out with us.. but he is 20 and like he would probly expect a lot from me and i don't know if i can deal with that again. I'm afraid to fall for someone again i guess. i just don't want to fall in love and then get fucked over again. i just cant deal with that shit and the pain and blah blah. But hes supposed to take me to the movies Sunday so we will see how that goes =]]

I hate when people have to be bitches to me for no reason and bad mouth the boy i like. i don't fucking take that shit. its pisses me off. so if you have a problem with the boy i like then fuck you.

My mom couldn't order my phone today. so we have to call it in missing so i can get my chocolate...my babyyy!

So yeahhh i have to download big e songs for bobby and put them on my i pod lol.
k night"

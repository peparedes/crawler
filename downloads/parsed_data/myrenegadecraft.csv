<i>In our fourth incarnation at the Art vs Craft Fair, Vainglory still is going strong with fashion-inspired accessory creation. Mainly focused on felt hair clips and a variety of wristcuffs made from recycled leather and cloth, we also offer a smattering of items crafted with love from the depths of our obsessions. Cat tents, beaded jewelry, anthropomorphic felt magnets, and PVC pipe didgeridoos have all made their appearances. We are anticipating another very successful run at this spring's fifth Art-vs-Craft fair. Thank you for considering us!

 We have been busy creating wonders that astound. Here are just a couple of pics from the archives.....

<img src=""http://img449.imageshack.us/img449/3272/bombs25nv.jpg"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"" />
These are made with high quality Almond oil, baking soda, corn starch, and (sometimes) fragrance and color. I get to use the non-perfect ones on myself and they fizz and burble in the most amusing fashion! Truly, these make bath time so much fun.

"event","i tried my first bath bombs today! 
<lj-cut>
The 1st ones I made were too wet and started to sprout warts and sagged into odd lumps rather than staying put in nice orbs. I mashed those into some more dry ingredients and all was well. I separated out some of the mixture and tried a ylang ylang aveda oil for scent. It seems to be working really well. The scent is strong with these ones. 

In a bit of the rest I put a concord grape concentrate natural food color. I had to really mash it into the dry ingredients to get the color right, and still it was very pale or speckly (kinda cute...) these ones ended up with a concord grape scent.

Here's some pics of the finished products:

<img src=""http://img372.imageshack.us/img372/9674/bombs25jd.jpg"" alt=""bath bombs"" />
</center>
You can't see the speckly color at all in the pics. The ones with the weird leeches on the tops are the ylang ylang scented ones. These are approx. 2 oz each.  I will be making more for the Art-vs-Craft fair this June!"

"event","MILWAUKEE OSTARA FESTIVAL 
Saturday, APRIL 1, 2006
HART PARK, Noon to 6pm
With Special Guest - Isaac Bonewits on Sunday evening (tickets for sale now!)
<lj-cut>
The Milwaukee Pagan Unity Council is holding its fifth annual Ostara Festival this year. MPUC is a local non-profit that hosts the Ostara Festival every year, and is a supporter of Pagan Pride Day. We attempt to build community among all Milwaukee people, and open up opportunities for education about the pagan community as well as events that welcome all walks. 

We are in full swing for bringing in vendors, workshops, performers, and more. We have some tarot readers, chair massage, and possibly even reiki practitioners as well as many local vendors from organic coffee companies to Herb stores to new age stores. Performances will include bellydancers, Nia, trancedance, and hopefully more! What are we missing?

We are looking for more people to be involved. Please contact me directly at irondawn@gmail.com to get forms and information, or send me your email address and I'll forward that information. Or if you prefer to have it mailed to you, send me your mailing address (always kept private) and we will send you information in our next mailing. (We never sell personal information.)
</lj-cut>
<b>Vendors:
We are open to all sorts of vendors if you think your wares will be of interest to the community. We've had past vendors such as booksellers, new age stores, Moonwise Herbs, clothing vendors, henna artists, reiki masters, tarot readers, bellydance costuming, jewlery dealers, artists, and much more. If you think the community would be interested, why don't you give it a try? 

Contact irondawn@gmail.com, or revonatah@yahoo.com for more information on how to be a part of this great event.

"event","I have not updated our site in a realy long time. eeek!

The Art vs Craft fair was great! we did fabulously and had a lot of interest. I sold kitty tents and fred sold digeridoos! I wasn't sure if the higher prices on these items would prohibit buyers, but they sold and i was so happy. :) They will be reappearing, for sure. 

We have applied for a booth at the upcoming Bayview Bash! The Bash is on Sept. 17th. No news yet, but the deadline is Aug 28th, i think, so we should know soon. 

We have also applied for the 3rd incarnation of the Art vs Craft Fair. We will know Sept 1st if we have a spot there. It will be a 2-day event again, in November! glee!

Pics coming very soon (i promise) of the craft fair and our current projects.

Thanks for your support!

We are heartened by the response to our creations and can't wait to do another fair. I was so impressed by the amount of creativity and sheer volume of the other vendors and by the size of the crowd.
Friday night was extra fun, what with the easy access to beer and other adult beverages from the Turner Hall restaurant downstairs."

"event","wassup readers..well i told ya'll i was goin to citywalk and I did..what a night!!..I got to see my babii i was happy as hell..It wasnt that many ppl at citywalk but it was a coo amount.At citywalk this gurl brandy tried to hollar and she wanted my number,she was coo but she had on fake contacts not the B.I...and some ppl told me she was a flip but I dont know,I think she was mad at me cuz i was ignorin her and talkin to other people.im sorry didnt mean it

after city walk me,my cousin,brazii,brazii's bestfriend,nia,and nia's homegurl we all went to hollywood and highland to get something to eat at Mcdonalds..my meal $7 for some damn 10 piece nuggets.never again.I will be lookin at that dollar menu 4 now on.I got pics but i'll put them on later and since the library is open now i can update my journal more ofter so all the readers look out.anyway so after that damn Mcdonalds we went to get my cuzin at burger king and then we kicked on the sidewalk.Me,nia,and kenesha*I think thats how u spell it*we tried to get some free pizza we told him we hadnt eatin all day and we didnt have any money,his bitch azz told us to come back in a hour.Later on me,my cuz,brazii,and shirley was at the bus stop and this weird azz lady that was drunk came to us and was jus talkin out her azz..it was funny az hell i should of took a picture of her but i didnt want her to get mad or some shit so I left her alone..I wish i could say the same for shirley cuz she was about to knock the flip out.this man was about to give her $50 to hit her..If she wasnt goin to hit her i know i was for $50 dollars and the nigha was serious he had the cash out and everything..The lady kept sayin that she didnt want to fight and she had cancer her eye and she was goin to die in 3 days thats something you would only hear in something like ""The Ring""...lol.""u got three days to live""..lol..anyway after that dumb lady tried to shake my hand and i was like hell naw she walked home and we caught the bus..imagin all that happin'n while we waitin to catch the bus..Later we went to the park and tried to play some basketball but this man was bein an azz and didnt want to share the damn ball..Imma remember that.Well me and miesha got home like at 4 in the mornin i was tired and cold..but the night was worth it..if u wanna hear more or other versions of our night read brazii's,my cousins,or nia's journal if she got one."

"event","Thought i would chuck in a random update as i sit here doing PBL and am getting seriously bored. Started at the Royal properly this week. I am on the Urology ward this week. Its not as much fun as it thought it would be mainly since our consultant clearly does not like students. Whilst waiting outside his office for nearly  an hour he saw me, blanked me knowing full well why i was there and disapered as i went chasing him. Still his SHO and F1 are great and they sort of looked after us and so as the day went on things picked up and now i am once again looking forward to another week there. Got surgery in the afternoon this week as well. Yay!

Moved in to my house on Smithdown with Rob, Richie and soon to be Carl and Paul. Odly enough i am having a great time. Its always interesting and when i ask for quite as i need sleep, they actually listen to me, thank you guys. The house may be a tip but its prety fun being there.

In other more serious news my car was smashed into yesterday. I had it parked up whilst doing my CCT and when i came back the front had been smashed up. More the likely a taxi swung in, hit it and left as the look of the damage would suggest. Thankfuly the damage seems more cosmetic, it looks bloody awful with with the front panel out of place and bonnet sticking up but there was no mechanical damage. Was able to drive it home easily. Micra's are great, they fall apart upon impact and since none of the parts are bent or really badly split its a simple case of a mechanic piecing it back together so shouldnt cost too much. Still pissed at having to pay out though.

Oh and things with Esther are going really well as well, been on a few dates now and i think we are getting along pretty great. Still, early days i guess.

Back to work"

"event","So second year is under way. Its not as bad as i thought it could be, but its still a hell of a lot of work. I will be working in the Royal now on rotation but am still waiting to see what GP i get placed at. Could be somewhere as far a way as the Wirrel, the thought of traveling makes me ill.

Still not moved into the house yet and wont be for another week it seems. With no matress and having to shift a weeks worth of PBL in 3 days thanks to the Bank Holiday last week i just wont have time. Well at least i will be out their hair for a bit longer.

Introduced Ho-man to the Raz on Thursday. He seemed to like it and now beleives that all the horror stories he had heard were a bit OTT, though i think i kept him there longer then he wanted.
 
My new PBL group is cool, we actually do work in this one and thankfully i knew some of them quite well before hand which is always good news. 

Was great seeing everyone again at Burge's sit off on Monday. He even has a new car now, and its better then mine. Well it was nice having the coolest car out of my mates for a while but all good things must come to an end.

Seems to be some drama going on with some of my local mates involving two of my best friends and of course a girl is causing all the trouble between them. Its getting pretty bad and i am terrified they want me to take sides. 

I think thats about it really for news, back to PBL i guess...oh the thrill of learning about Angina and Heart Attacks, makes me ever want to eat KFC again."

From theft, to random complaints lodged against me i have seen it all these past weeks. Dont you just love retail work and the great British public.

In gaming news, Super DBZ rules and thats all i will say as most people who read this...infact all probably do not quite hold DBZ in the same light i do. But it does rule.

Finally got the keys to my student house. Its not too bad, bigger then i remember anyway. Oh and i certainly feel safe behind my steal bared window in my room. Wish i had known the house was in Toxteth. As Louise put it you can tell a girl has never lived there as it was a tip, with a random tree stump in the main hall. Still a bit of cleaning later and all is right, big thanks to Louise and Richie for helping with that. I wont even get into the saga of the gas and power, but that should be solved soon. I add gas providers to my list of business that i hate.

Been gearing up into revision mode again for my resit, a little nervous but i feel i should be ok this time. 

Looking forward to the birthday bash in London as well, although shopping for the birthday peeps isnt easy. May have to recruit some help."

So i wont even get it tomorrow, probably wont see it until MOnday. It was the only thing that was keeping me going through my 14 hour shift.

Ah well its only a game...i guess.

Here is a strange flash movie with oddly catchy music. Apparently the popularity of this song on 4chan has caused the Finish group whose song it is to consider touring Europe. That's the power of flash it seems.

"event","Busy week this week. Spent the usual extra hours in work although i have been doing some of the night shifts this week. This usually involves us rushing to put out over 30 cages worth of stock in 5 hours between sometimes 8 and sometimes 4 people. I think i have the most fun actually during the night shift since all we do is mess around. For example the Thursday shift ended about 9.30pm with us playing football in the middle of Bold Street, nearly smashing 2 car windows, smacking some random guy in the buts (he was drunk, its ok) and Fuad trying to do something stylish but nearly breaking his back.

Other things i have done, random road trips to Southport at 11pm, that was fun. Picked up my clinical skills feedback, i failed by some stupid amount all cos of one school boy error. Well i learn the hard way it seems. 

It was both my friends Aaron and Burge's 20th Birthday this weekend and so we ventured out to town Saturday evening. Wow that was a busy night. Havn't been on a pub crawl like that in maybe a year i think. Thankfully i knew when to quit considering i was in work at 9am the next morning. However, Burge and Howard clearly did not, my my they where so drunk. Bumped into Dave to as well and met one of his other mates. Nice guy. 

Work the next morning was interesting, i guess i was perhaps a little drunk still, considering i got home at 4am and was up again at 7.30 and actually didnt sleep. Thankfully no customer abuse today so all was good.

In other more sad news my friend who ran the local barbers where i have been going to get my haircut since i was about 2 died last week. He only took over the buisness when his father bought it a few years ago. The guy was only 18 and as yet i have not been able to find out how he died. People keep giving me different stories. It all just seemed so sudden, will visit the shop tomorrow which has closed and had a sort of memorial placed in front of it. Really did make me think how you must enjoy life as much as you can. 

That will do for now i think."

"event","So there i am minding my own business leaving the Post Office after having picked up my new Tax disc. I pull out and dirve along down the narrow road that with parked cars lining the street leaves one lane free. I am travleing passed the cars with about 3 cars behind me when some guy comes speeding round the corner, decides not to wait and plows down the lane. He mounts the curb a little to get past but it isn't enough and he hits the front of my car and sends himself further onto the curb, good thing there where no people on the side at the time. Now i had no where to go with all the parked cars and had to slam on once i saw he was not going to wait, which at the speed he was going wasnt long, as well as controlling the car after the impact so i didnt go spinning into the parked cars myself as i hadnt even come to a complete stop when he hit. 

Somehow i got off with only a scratched bumper. It was a hard impact but there was no damage at all. The other driver on the other hand had damaged his wheel before the crash when he mounted the curb and scratched his body work on a wall as he futher went on the curb. Course he blames me and i blame him but the people in the cars behind me and some random kids that had stopped after seeing the crash to wait for a fight where all shouting at him saying it was his fault. So he got back in hsi car, and drove off. I a little shaken got back in my car and drove off as well.

And thats my tale for the day."

"event","Well lets start off with the positive bits. My exams are done, the written papers could have gone far better but the OSCE and comm skills seemed ok. Guess i will find out for certain at the end of June and having to resit wouldnt bother me as it is incentive to learn the work better. 
 
Laura cooked a roast meal for us all Friday evening, was very nice. Then we where joined by Marianne, Emma, LauraHat and Izzy who came to sample and add to the mounds of cake that had been aquired at the fangirl faction HQ. 

Went to Alton Towers with Laura, Becci, Saz, Cate, LauraHat and Simon on Saturday. Was great fun. We went on Air, Rita, Nemisis and all the other rides you would go on there. I even got to go on one called Enterprise that i enjoyed for the name alone. Sad yes but there you go. I managed to be the only one who stayed mostly dry on the rapids to, with Becci coming off the worse. Her face as that wave hit her was priceless. Though the rapids did cost me my candyfloss bucket which i didnt put the lid onto properly so once i got off the ride i discovered water was in and all i had was a red mess. Towards the end though the park seemed to have a technical fault with the power that meant none of the rides worked. Was only in the last 30mins so wasnt too bad and could have been a lot worse. Oh and yay for me for having driven the furthest i ever have on the motorway and survived.

The next morning was the hard part. Saying good by to Laura, Becci and Saz. They left in that order and it just seemed to get worse as teh day went on. I know i havnt known them for a great length of time, only really since i started going out with Laura but they where still good friends and great people who i will miss greatly. They had best show up for my 21st. It was heartbreaking to watch each of them drive off. Its going to be the same when i watch some of my other friends leave this coming weekend but at least i know they will return to liverpool. I guess thats Uni for you.

Laura and I will be having a go at long distance, with the fact that its only 2 and a half hours on the train it wont be that hard to go see her. I at least will attempt to make it work and i am really looking forward to seeing her again for her bday in just 2 weeks. 

Now i must go busy myself, i have so much to do."

"event","Another revision break, so another update. 

I seem to have collected a fair old amount of anime to watch once these exams are over. I have been downloading them for weeks but just not watching. Lets see i have Eureka seven eps 14-26 to watch, the rest of Turn A gundam, the last 5 eps of Gundam X, that strange Yuri mecha thingy that Ho-man told me about, lots and lots of One Piece (like 50eps), Dr Slump, Legend of the Galactic Heroes (better then it sounds) and tons of other stuff. Also downloaded an episode of some new sereis called Simoun recommened by Emma. Decided to watch it as it was only one ep, felt dirty just from the opening and decided to delete it there and then. Its more then even i can take.

I actually feel as though i may survive these exams, just barely. If i can pull it off so only one paper is a resit i will feel like i have accomplished my goal. Oh and these anatomy flash cards are a god send.

As for my activites this week aside from revision. Went to Burge's BBQ on Friday, was fun seeing the gang again. Was worth it just to see that my mate Aaron has been forced to have his hair so drasticly cut just so he can get a job. He now plans to get the job then re-grow his hair even longer to rebel. He is crazy. I made a quick exit from that around 9.30ish to get the train, discovered the back gates where locked, missed the train and stood in the rain for 30mins. Arrived at the Wetherspoons where much crazyness was had. A new society was born and Dave went where he is never going to go again. Saturday i went round to Laura's to watch the Eurovision Song Contest. You know its going to be tacky but your never quite prepared. Though i discovred two legendary bands that night, the gothic rockers Lordi and some Lithuania pub band who as good as Lordi was clearly should have won. I should have forced eveyone there to vote for them. Bald guy spazzing out on the dance floor gets the British vote i think.

The remainder of the week will be spent in the library of a day and crying into a book at night. Wish me luck people, first paper 10am Thursday."

It would seem exam stress is getting to be as i am starting to feel real out of sorts. I am still feeling very bitter over when my OSCE has been placed. True there have been many times when i have had exams one day and then more the next day but its the fact that the rest of the medical school get at least another 5 days after me to revise for the OSCE, some even get another week and a half after i have done mine. True noone ever said life was fair but it doesn't mean i can't feel bitter about it, god i am turning all Emo in my old age.

There are some good things happening at least at the moment...eh there is a new DBZ game out in June, thats good at least. 

At least once the exams are over i can start working full time again, i am even looking forward to working in the park again. Getting to do some out doors work and playing in the sun with the kids there. Whihc usually involves us trying to organise games and them hurling abuse at us. Still makes a change from book work.

Looking forward to going out tonight, BBQ at Burge's then off to town. At least for one night i can forget my worries and enjoy the company of friends.

"event","Hmm, so what have I been upto since i last posted. Well on Monday i met up with the gang at Fi's room for the post Easter reunion. That was cool. It was there i was introduced to the wonder that is 2 player Guitar Hero (Despite me sucking at it) as well as the desire to once again learn to play the guitar after all these years of no practice. Means i need to buy a new one though as my old one is a little small for me now. Damn, more money i must spend.

Tuesday in PBL i got given a hell of a lot of learning objectives to do, which i should still be doing instead of typing this. Kinda unfair that we get given so much to do when i still haven't totally learned the old stuff. Ah well. At least lunch with Laura was fun that day.

Thursday i met up with Burge and Emma and looked at the photos from our trip to Looe. I now have a shiny disc with over 100 photos on from it and i look a prat on every single on i am on. Might post some of the better ones on here later for your amusement.

Friday i went to pizza hutt with some of LAS after they had been to see Silent Hill. It was so much fun, much madness and crudeness happened though its possible i did get a bit carried away with the jokes. Food was good to.

Saturday i went to see Ice Age 2 with Laura. Now people have been slagging that movie off in reviews and true it wasnt as good as the first but it was still a very funny movie. Got to love Scratt and his acorn. Life is so unfair to him. He finally makes it to Acorn Heaven with its golden gates, fields of Acorns and even one giant God acorn and then Sid brings him back to life. Isnt life or in this case afterlife i guess cruel. 

Sunday in work i once again had to play security guard but nothing much happened this week thankfully. I am prety sure someone nicked something but unless you clearly see them do it you cannot challenge them. Ah well. Went out the pub with  Burge and Emma when i got home. Was fun, we talked about random stuff and bumped into two former associates from Sixth Form. One has gotten really big but still very friendly, and one has gotten weirder. He scared me a little. 

Today was a day of work despite being a Bank Holiday and a random trip out with Carl for lunch and chat, as well as buying some manga. After 2 years of saying i will my quest to own all the Dragon Ball manga has began with me buying volumes 1 and 2. Now to decide whether or not i feel upto Double Vision tonight. Emma wont be happy with me if i don't go but with this headache and work load i probably shouldn't."

 Well i learned to take temperatures today in clinical skills. The cynic in me thinks it was a waste of time but apparently it's such a basic thing that people always screw up. Watch me do that now in the OSCE.

Went to Laura's last night to drop off the Sailor Moon musical i downloaded for them and see the girls again. Its evil and i only watched a brief bit while the girls did. Making Becci download the rest as i dont think i could live with myself if i download any more. Anyway I like going to the fangirl HQ, they fed me which i did not expect at all. Thanks again. Course they got their own back with Descendants of Darkness some and some rather questionable manga that they showed me. Simon was kind enough to bring over his chipped PS2 so i can finally play those import Gundam games i bought that i can not play. 

Encounters in Space, a Universal Century game featuring 0079 and 0083 Gundam is awful. I had heard it was like ZOE but its not. Maybe it would get better if i played more but i am not as disappointed at not being able to play it as i was.

Gundam SEED Destiny: Generation of CE. Once we finally worked out how to move the units (its in japanese unlike the other) it was fun. Its a turn based strategy game so isnt exactly one you can pick up and play. This i really want to play more so will defo be getting a slide card so i dont need to rob Simon's PS2.

Now its off to do revision before traveling to Carnatic."

"event","Hmm, well i have this thing so i guess i might as well update it a little more then I do. Its not like i have anything else to do with my time and it makes a great distraction from revision.

Well thats the Sailor Moon Musical thingy downloaded for Laura and Becci. They will have no idea who is who in it, sadly i probably will, but i promised them ages ago i would search the net for this and finally i have.

Had the grandparents over for tea today. Was fun. I dont see them half as much as i should with Uni and stuff. Need to make time for the family over summer.

Job hunt continues. Here is hoping GAME give me something again, this time at a point in time when i am not starting Uni or have found another job whihc they seem to keep doing. Would love to work in GAME over the summer, then again what geek wouldnt."

"event","Eventfull week. Lets start with the bad stuff. Firstly my CCT family that i have to study and present a case from in order to pass first year medicine have left the country. This leaves me and my partner Sayeed high and dry. I just hope that some how the GP clinic can get me a replacement in time, i mean its not our fault at all. Anyway, the main bad news was today. There was a time when i used to enjoy going to work, yes i did like working there. Now i hate it, i dread sundays there. The new management in their effort to only have to pay smaller wages are attempting to reduce the staff to nothing but under 18s. How are they doing this, by victimizing the over 20s, me included. I wont go into details but lets just say by the end of just one day one person was fired, 6 given warnings and 2 forced to quit cos their hours where slashed so badly. Their plan seems to be working. I will be leaving there pretty soon i think. 


Now the good news, or fun news anyway. Presentation on Wednesday went well. Was given nothing but positive feedback and general applause so that was a win i think.

 Modos was on Thursday. Yet more drunken fun. Each one seems to be getting better and better. I had so much fun. Only bad thing was that Laura was feeling very under the weather and i opted to leave early to take her home. She would have easily done it herself but i felt better making sure she was ok.

Now paintballing, so much fun despite the few negatives.  It wasnt the best paintball site i have been to, but could have been much worse and did have free tea. Most games where just capture the flag, the marashals where both crude and cruel, but mainly useless. Becci and i sat behind cover screaming for help but non came despite their original promise to come fix broken guns on call. Some how she managed to fix her gun but i had to leave the battle to get mine fixed. Went to one marshall, got to told to see another. Went to the next marshall, got to told to move on. Was finally given a new gun and returned to the fight to cover Simon for one of his famous dynamic dives into action. Other stuff that annoyed me was how there where a few people cheating, sometimes stopped by the marshal overtimes helped and the masks sucked, no combat hoods or anything to protect teh back of the head. Oh and some guns kept jamming.

For me it was the people i was with that made the day. Covering one of the last games with Becci despite the broken gun, being pinned down for a whole game with Carl, lying behind a whole 2 tyre high cover with Kev, attempting to look up on Nick's advice only to be shot in the face from like 2 yards away. Yeh there wasn't much advancing but there was alot of sitting and muttering of ""we are so screwed"". I loved my ballet dive of death that lead to the only really visible marks i have. The Role Players even behaved far better then i ever thought they did, i openly admit, for the most part i was wrong about them. In this sense anyway.

I leave a whole paragraph for the free-for-all though. See here you get to shoot anyone and use your remaining ammo. So we formed two lines that moved away from each other then turned and fired. I managed to hit becci in the back of her head (unprotected) and possibly somewhere else but i forget. She will no doubt remind me at some point. I then somehow managed to blast up Laura's leg, realized my mistake and ducked so she didnt see who it was. Deciding to confess later think it wasnt that bad only to find that she had rather enlarged bruises that i believe are getting bigger. To both i am sorry. Still Simon managed to also blast Laura in the mouth as well as leave Carl cowering in fear. So i dont have all the guilt. After a lovely meal at pizza hut as an apology Becci received a large drink and Laura got cake from Simon. I must also buy manga and chocolate for Laura and all will be back to normal.

So ups and downs but still a good week. Now for the baby clinic this week and yet more PBL, oh the fun. Oh and one day i will learn how to use LJ cuts."

"event","Well i am that bored i might as well put something in this. Lets see what has happened since i last posted.
Well there was Modos a few weeks ago, that was fun, drunken fun in fact. Lots of random conversations, guys sitting on laps (sounds wrong) and random soakings by a few friends getting too excited when wetting their hair. Only bad thing was some random guy on the way back to the Fangirl HQ that decided it would be fun to pick on Kev then dig me in the arm, i just love this city sometimes. 

What else, well i finally arranged my CCT GP visit, been looking forward to this for a while. It will be fun to see some medicine in action, even if it is only really a baby clinic thingy. Took long enough to get things going, the Universtiy only arranged things with the surgery a few days before i was meant to arrange times with them so they didnt have enough families to assign to the students coming, but that seems to have been taken care of now. I hope. 

Went to town with Carl, Dave, Amy etc last Thursday. Was a fun night although Amy took revenge on me for beating her so badly at pool last time (she only beat me half as bad as i got her). Didnt end to well when Rob felt the power of Stella and threw up on the club floor, wasnt too impressed at the dude who tried to make Rob clean up even though he clearly was not with what was going on. Think Rob felt quite embarassed, dont worry, happens to us all and at least you know now.

Saw Mikey H and Aaron again for the first time in months, i really have been neglecting them and my other pre Uni mates lately. Feeling a little guilty over that so i will have to make up for that.

Fondue party at Tim and Simon's was fantastic. So much crazy stuff. Watching 80s and 90s cartoon intros while fun made me feel old, and sad. Playing cards with these guys is dangerous as when Becci is allowed to make rules, men seem to loose clothes. Or in mine and Kev's case, our pride with being made to do the fusion dance. All good fun though and made all the better with ending the evening off with Truth of Dare (only truth, noone was made enough to pick Dare).

Plan for the week, actually do some PBL, go to the GPs surgery tomorrow. Party at Howard's thursday evening, LAS friday and if i can convince her a big posh dinner with Laura on sat, as i havnt been to a nice restaurant in ages and want to get dressed up and go. 

Wow that was longer then i thought, and done while sort of half watching Atlantis. Well, time for some more late night PBL."

"event","Guess i should update now i acutally have some free time. Well finally the pain is over as my SSM is finished. .Standing at 3230 words of total crap i feel rather pleased. Even managed to get it in 30mins before the dead line after some rather unsafe driving to town. So what if that if the light is red, road is one way, old lady wants to cross, i got a project to hand in. 
    
Sad days in work, my buddy John has been forced to move. My shop will seriously never be the same again, that guy was the life and soul of the place and our evil area manager with her grudge against him had to make him move. Still we had a great last day and gave him a good send off. If there is a God, he will be moved back soon, assuming he actually does some work in the new shop. I should point out though that the new shop is Lord Street so is only 3 streets away from our current shop but thats 3 streets too far.

This week is back to PBL, which i acutally had today with a rather cool new group. Though i miss our tutor Fred, he was great, he let us do what we wanted whilst still sort of working. Our new bloke will make us work real hard now it seems. I guess i can only benefit in the end. Got my clinical placement to, its in Ormskirk. Typical, i pick 4 that are close to my house and a fith one that is a fair distance off and thats the one i get. Still i am looking forward to it, a chance for a medical adventure in the big bad world. For the rest of the week i have more PBL to do as well as Modo's on Thursday and LAS on Friday. Shouldnt be a bad week overall i guess."

"event","Been a pretty good couple of days. My SSM is in full swing now having finally gotten the hang of searching for Journals with pubmed. Just a case of reading them now and writing them up. So much to do, so little time. 

Chris' 20th Birthday party was yesterday. It was fancy dress with the theme of rockstars and movie stars. Loads of people turned up and, amazingly, all in costume. Standout cosumtes where Mr Incredible, Mr T, Xena and about 6 Blue's Brothers. Oh and of course my Obi wan costume, it rules so much. Was a good night all in all just a shame i had to miss LAS to go. 

After a nice lie in today i did some work and popped over to the halls to see Rob. We played Gamecube. A little bit embarassed that he took me apart so badly when playing Wario Ware. I still think he cheats at that somehow. Still, we played Gundam vs Zeta Gundam and Naruto GNT 3, both of which i kicked ass at. 

Tomorrow i got work and a stock take, oh the fun. Think i might go kill myself."

"event","Well with Rob shoving his Live Journal in my face I guess its prompted me to set one up for myself. Not like many people are gonna read it but still when you have free time i guess i should put it to some kinda use. 

Gotta say today was a good day though. After going to the self marking session in Uni I find i have scored far better then i thought i had on the written part of paper 2. 39/50 isn't too bad at all, as long as the moderators don't knock it down a few marks. Though that still leaves all the multi choice questions, all of paper 1 and the evil OSCEs. Having heard a few horror stories now from some of the other medics about the torment that exam brings i cant say i feel good about it at all. Still, tis only a mock, thank God. Guess tomorrow is gonna be revision mixed in with some time on Timesplitters: Future Perfect, assuming it comes in the post tomorrow."

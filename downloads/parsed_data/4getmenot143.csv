A lost cause two years gone <em>bye</em> for aheart that breaks twice for everytime it heals and a tear that drys everytime it hits the cheek of a girl with a bitter sweet melody to her life and like a song she sings to the beat of <strike>cheats</strike>, <strike>lies</strike>, and <strike>lovers</strike> who loved everyone else but her and her faith is nothing more then her belief in failure to really <em>""forgive and forget"" </em>because after all who could love the girl with the beautiful smile and the soul that hides a thousand secrets behind her deep brown eyes. Tell me why we reach for the stars knowing we can't touch the sky? Are we trying to fly or trying to fall? And with one foot in the gate to heaven and the other in the pitt of hell do we seek to redeem outselves or seek to forget reality in exchange for eternity. So what would we be if we never knew <strong>pain</strong> and <strong>suffering</strong> and <strong>love</strong>? We would be 6 feet under the ground, thoughtless, unremembered, cold and bitter ""but atleast if i was there,"" she whispered, "" I would'nt have to fight over you.""<br /><br />...just needed to do something to get my mind off of other things.<br /><br /><font size=""3""><strong><em>we will live to love another day.<br />even if it takes forever.</em></strong></font>"

Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passin' through
So hello Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you

When I don't feel like company
You make yourself at home
Even though you know
I'd rather be alone
Love walked out on me
And didn't even close the door
Next thing I know I'm starin'
At your shadow on the floor

So hello Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
or only passin' through
So hello Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you

I wish that I could say it's nice
To see you back again
We're not exactly strangers
But we're not exactly friends
You know you're not invited but
You keep on comin' round
The last thing that I need is you
To kick me when I'm down

Come in and wear your welcome out

i gained amazing friends.
lost touch with old friends.
met my best friend/bf ryan.
*fell in love with him too.
got friendships back that i thought couldnt be mended.
got my heart broken.
broke a heart or two.
let myself love someone unlike anyone i had ever met before.
got into the longest relationship of my life.. almost a year now..
grew up a little.
sadly watched a good person leave us for heaven. R.I.P. heather<3
made some mistakes.
met a ton of new people who continue to influence me in positive ways.
finally got a nice part in the musical.
realized im not perfect and i like it that way.
realized i cant control a lot of things that some how seem to comtrol me, but i can control the way i let them effect me.

i love u.. happy new year
i wish u were here to kiss me at midnight<3

its a new year - leave the past in the past and get ready for a new beginning 

&HERE'S TO THE FUTURE BECAUSE IM OVER THE PAST."

<FONT color=#ccccff>When you start falling
Who's gonna catch you
I'm willing to bet you
It will be me
Who's gonna love you
Like there's no other
Search and discover
It will be me

When all the others
Have gone and hurt you
Who won't desert you
It will be me
Weighing the options
So much to think of
But when you think love
It will be me

You may not see it now
Love is strange that way
Someday somewhere baby somehow

When you've been broken
And dreams don't oblige you
Who's that beside you
Oh, it will be me

You may not see it now
Love is strange that way
Someday somewhere baby somehow

Who'll be your only
True romancer
You know the answer
It will be me

What will it take to
Bring you to your senses
And finally convince you
It will be me

Baby i've been drifting away
I've been dreaming all day
Of holding you, touching you
The only thing I wanna do
Is be with you, as close to you
As I can be

Lets make love
All night long
Until all of our strength is gone
Hold on tight, just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Lets make love

Do you know what you do to me
Everything inside of me
Is wanting you, needing you
I'm so in love with you
Look in my eyes
Lets get lost tonight
In each other

Lets make love
All night long
Until all of our strength is gone
Hold on tight, just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Lets make love"

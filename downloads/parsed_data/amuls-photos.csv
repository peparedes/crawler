"event","<p>There&#8217;s a term I&#8217;ve borrowed from the IT industry: <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving"">yak shaving</a>, and this blog entry is a big hairy yak that I&#8217;m going to shave for a few minutes.</p>
<p>See, it&#8217;s time for me to order more inventory. I&#8217;m finally starting to come to grips with the fact that while I may spend my days living like an artist, I actually earn my money by being a retail shop, and part of accepting that reality means worrying about things like overhead, profit/cost margins, and the popularity of my products. Gah, I hate that term: products. </p>
<p>When I first started, I sold nothing but 8&#215;10s of my images, and didn&#8217;t even bother to keep track of which individual images were selling. Then, I started caravan&#8217;ing with other artists to these shows, other people who make their living doing nothing but art sales, and I began to realize that if I wanted to be serious about this, I would have to treat it seriously. I expanded my &#8220;product line&#8221; to include Original Size Limited Editions, 20&#215;30s, 13&#215;19s, 11&#215;17 poster prints, as well as my old 8&#215;10s. I took those options directly from my good friend (and erstwhile business mentor), <a href=""http://www.nigelsade.com/"">Nigel Sade</a>. </p>
<p>Nigel is an oil painter, and this creates some pretty major differences between the value of our originals. His original work are paintings on various types of hard panels, some large enough to require easels, others small enough to fit in his satchel while he goes on his frequent walkabouts. The reproduction process he uses is inherently an analog-to-digital conversion (his originals, after all, are analog). </p>
<p>By contrast, my images convert to digital sometime before the finishing process. They may start as digital images, or they may start as analog film which gets converted to digital in order to be processed. It&#8217;s sort of obvious, really, that they get turned into digital images before they are done &#8212; my medium of choice is digital, these days. Oh, I still love making Black and Whites (though I prefer using the French term for such analog darkroom work: <i>Argentine</i> Prints, after the silver halides) but they&#8217;re expensive to produce and the audiences I sell to won&#8217;t buy them for the prices I need to charge, because they think of photographs as inherently reproducible. </p>
<p>But this really only makes a difference to those unicorns of the Artistic Forest, the Collectors. For the main body of my income, I depend on selling the reproductions, not the originals. And since this is, after all, a retail shop, and the size of my shop is dictated by my vehicle&#8217;s carrying capacity, my income is dependent on making wise inventory choices. Simply put, if I don&#8217;t have a 20&#215;30 version of an image, I&#8217;m never going to sell one for a hundred bucks. But which 20&#215;30s should I bring? Which should I hang up?</p>
<p>I recently calculated the total sales numbers of each image, regardless of print size, to try to get an idea of which images I should show in the larger sizes. There are a huge number of flaws with this theory, and my artist side screams bloody murder at the thought, but I&#8217;m trying to be all business like here.</p>
<p><b>Number 1</b><br />
<img src=""http://amul.biz/d/577-13/archetys_big.jpg"" width=""300px""/></p>
<p><b>Number 2</b><br />
<img src=""http://amul.biz/d/1800-2/Auriel_35-035.jpg"" width=""300px""/></p>
<p>Now, right here I have a major problem. I&#8217;ve been selling copies of <i>Geminatrix</i> since 2007 or earlier. <i>Raver Lady</i> has been on the market for something under a year, I want to say. (I don&#8217;t actually <i>know</i> because my records look like an artist&#8217;s records). On the other hand, I knew exponentially more about *selling* when I first produced Raver Lady. As a result, Raver Lady has actually earned me more income, because I sold it in a greater variety of (more expensive) sizes.</p>
<p>Regardless, I&#8217;ve got both of those in stock, and so I shouldn&#8217;t shave that part of the yak before ordering stuff.</p>
<p><b>Number 3</b><br />
<img src=""http://amul.biz/d/1865-3/Jayda05-33.jpg""  width=""300px"" /></p>
<p><b>Number 4</b><br />
<img src=""http://amul.biz/d/1881-3/BreadWinners.jpg"" width=""300px""/></p>
<p>My 3rd and 4th most successful pieces both have, to my mind, obvious target audiences. But since I knew instinctively what demographic they would have appealed to, I feel like they should have outsold the other two. There is some kind of Inherent Awesomeness Vs Inherent Audience math at work here, but there are too many complicating factors for me to figure it out. What&#8217;s more, <i>Bread Winners</i> was only ever popular at its <i>first show</i>. Ever since then, it&#8217;s sales figures have been below average. </p>
<p>Also, while I&#8217;m counting things out, I&#8217;ll note that my <i>entire night photography collection</i> taken as a single item lot, ranks below these in sales. Now, is that because I haven&#8217;t stocked them in a variety of sizes, or displayed them properly, or is it because they&#8217;re so different than the rest of my work? Either way, they take far longer for me to finish (perhaps because of my unfamiliarity with the subject matter) than the rest, and cost more to produce initially. Because of these various factors, I&#8217;ve been subconsciously phasing them out. Should I add them back in, and do it properly, to see how they&#8217;ll work?</p>
<p>As a convention vendor, who spends a scant 4-8 days a month with an open store, these are dangerous questions to flirt with.</p>
<p>These images are count as &#8220;clear winners&#8221; in my fine art sales portfolio. But what about images like this one?</p>
<p><img src=""http://amul.biz/v/FineArt/Archetyped/Taina01-034.jpg.html"" width=""300px""/></p>
<p>When I finished <i>Depths of Desire</i> and showed it to my friends and colleagues, we all thought it was going to be clear seller. Yet total sales of that piece, both in quantities and profits, has put it among the lower half of my images, even after taking the relatively few number of shows it&#8217;s been to into consideration. Did I misjudge the quality of the image? Or merely its sales potential?</p>
<p>This is where being an artist gets tricksy. The last thing that I want to do is produce images simply because they&#8217;ll sell, but I have to balance that with the need to be shrewd about the business aspect of my self-employment. Finding that balance is usually painful, often terrifying, and a regular part of my career.</p>

"event","<p>I haven&#8217;t thought about the term <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing"">Satisficing</a> since my days as a programming major at Carnegie Mellon, but the topic came up again and I realized that I lean towards a satisficing strategy most of the time. </p>
<p>In a nutshell: Satisficers are content to make less than optimal decisions, on the theory that most of the time any decision will be good enough, and the cost in time to produce an optimal result is higher than the risk of making an insufficient choice.  Maximizers seek as much information as possible before making a decision, with the confidence that the decision will be better than it would have been otherwise.</p>
<p>I realize now that much of my frustration with the people who frequently give me business advice is that they are maximizers and I am a satisficer. But this doesn&#8217;t answer the more important question: is satisficing a valid business strategy for the art sales aspect of my business? In the commercial world, photographers usually need to bid on projects, and that seems to imply that maximizers will be more successful. </p>
<p>This tangents into the larger question of whether my career goal is really about maximizing profit. The very term suggests a preference for a strategy which is foreign to me. I can&#8217;t imagine many investors would be willing to support a company dedicated to satisficing their profit goals. On the other hand, I&#8217;m not a corporation, so does this really apply to my business?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big question, and one deserving of far more thought than I currently have time to give it.</p>

<p>As a result, I spent my afternoon saying things like, &#8220;Look over there! Is that love? Yeah, look at it closely. It <i>could</i> be Love, but it looks kind of grimy. Sorta wilted. Forlorn. Look, it may be Love, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to stick it in my pocket, you know what I&#8217;m saying?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m spending the evening talking to myself. &#8220;Whoa. What&#8217;s he looking at now? That doesn&#8217;t look like any Love I&#8217;ve seen. I think he&#8217;s found an Infatuation. Yeah, infatuations look like that sometimes. Hey, now! What&#8217;s that? Oh, that&#8217;s not Love. That&#8217;s&#8230;.that&#8217;s&#8230;.I dunno what that is&#8230;.but it ain&#8217;t Love, that&#8217;s for sure!&#8221;</p>

"event","I've noticed recently that the internet sometimes seems so big to me that it becomes almost self-defeating. When seeking pro-photo communities, for example, the number of options are overwhelming and strangely deceptive.

To start with, there are so many communities where people share images and talk photography that I could easily spend all my time reading them. Ideally, I'd like to limit myself to communities that are strictly professional for my shop talk, but contain potential art buyers for the display of my work. Or perhaps I should find a community that is multimedia, but shares my interest in subject matter. Then, too, I need somewhere that keeps me abreast of the technology and equipment news, without getting sucked into the mindset that my equipment determines what sort of photographer I am.

</lj-cut>

Even among my social and hobby-based online communities, there is a tendency to get stuck in the trivial details. One hobby-based site I am generates at least <em>200 messages a week</em> arguing over terminology.

I recently attend <a href=""http://www.wppionline.com/index.tml"">WPPI</a>, a pro-photography convention focusing on Wedding and Portrait photography (two areas that I spend a lot more time thinking about than involving myself in). I picked up a number of memberships in the heat of the moment, and now must evaluate exactly how much time I have to spend reading all these conversations. Several of the books that I picked up also have online communities built around them. Should I even check them out? What value could they provide to me?

I have been traditionally hesitant to join art-based communities like <a href=""http://www.deviantart.com/"">Deviant Art</a> and <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/"">Etsy</a>, or participate heavily in networking sites like <a href=""http://www.modelmayhem.com/"">Model Mayhem</a>. My dubious reasoning for this is that I would prefer people to come to MY site. Yet, all of these places provide a built-in audience much larger than I could ever hope to generate on my own.

My purpose for joining these websites, taking part in these communities, is to build what I refer to as My Army Of Dreamers. I'm seeking friendships that will encourage my own creativity, push my efforts, and support me in those moments of self-doubt which plague all creative professionals. Yet, I am often reminded of a parable from <em>Art and Fear</em> by David Bayles and Ted Orland:

A pottery class is divided into two groups. The first group is told that their grades will be determined entirely by the quality of the single best pot they make. The second group is told that their grades will be based entirely on the quantity of pots produced, regardless of quality. The first group spent the entire semester debating the nature of The Perfect Pot, and while they had many nice theories, the work they produced failed to live up to their own beliefs about such perfection. Meanwhile, in addition to producing a large number of pots, the second group made better pots, faster and more consistently. The moral to the story is obvious: talk is cheap; doing it is what makes you good at it.

(Tangent: Whenever I quote that book, I have to include my other favorite anecdote. A frustrated young piano student complains to his mentor, ""It just never sounds as good as it does in my head!"" The mentor sagely replies, ""What makes you think that is ever going to change?"")</lj-cut>

This, then, is the dilemma: I want a community to support my endeavors, but I worry that I'd be better off spending all that time just taking some darn photos."

I&#8217;ve really enjoyed working with the M2I guys (that&#8217;s <i>Mesh 2 Internet,</i> a translation protocol) and look forward to sharing more of our work as it goes live here on Tellus. Er, Earth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still sort of odd to make that distinction.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a twitter person, you can check out the twitterfeed for the <a href=""http://twitter.com/mediators"">Port Outreach Mediators</a>. It&#8217;s sort of typical of Continuous Labs, and most of their clients from what I&#8217;ve seen, for somebody like the Mediators to bubble up to the top of the project list. It&#8217;s the guys who care <i>right f&#8217;ing now</i> that get their stuff done. I bet there&#8217;s a lesson in that. </p>
<p>Thankfully, the M2I wordpress plugin isn&#8217;t my baby at all, since I heard they just came discovered a basic paradigm barrier. But you can check out the <a href=""http://portoutreach.com/"">Port Outreach Tourism</a> site in the meantime.</p>

<p>&#8220;People often ask me why I paint so many women. The answer is that these are not simply paintings of women. They are paintings of emotions. Men are taught to not show their feelings, to project a certain preconceived idea of masculinity. Women express a far more subtle range of intimacy and vulnerability.&#8221; - <a href=""https://www.artifactsgallery.com/art.asp?=A&#038;ID=640"">Steve Hanks</a></p>

"event","<p>An attendee from GenCon, where I set up a last-minute booth to sell my photos, suggested that I check out <a href=""http://www.worth1000.com/default.asp?display=photography&#038;filter=f.format_id=1"">Worth 1000</a>, a daily photography contest website. They also have daily contests for 3D rendering (for some reason labeled &#8220;Photoshop&#8221;), Illustration, graphic design, and writing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the site doesn&#8217;t allow image merging or collaging, so it doesn&#8217;t have a strong appeal to me right now. While the advanced photo contests allow for a wide range of image manipulation skills, and their copyright usage rules seem reasonable, the entries I&#8217;ve seen for the non-photo contests seem fairly slipshod. Many of the photos are very impressive, but are almost wholly tabletop photography, given the nature of the contests. Still, for those who need that extra push to practice their art-making skills.</p>
<p>Certainly, I&#8217;m now thinking about buying some cheap tabletop lighting equipment suggested to me by <a href=""http://www.aubryphoto.com/"">Daniel Aubry</a> and taking a crack at these, just for the sake of motivation and tabletop work.</p>

"event","<p>Spent a little time today working on the workshop I&#8217;ll be giving at <a href=""http://www.dragoncon.org"">DragonCon,</a> entitled &#8220;Photographic Truth, Myth of.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are many thoughts that I&#8217;m trying to see if I can work into the conversation. While I was talking to <a href=""http://www.galindorf.com"">Liz Galindorf</a> about this, we got into a heated discussion about the validity of digital manipulation. Liz suggested that while digital manipulation is a useful skill to know, it is not generally needed. I, on the other hand, argue that the very act of photography is already a manipulation, and so you have a duty to finish manipulating it until it achieves your intention.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought initially to include an argument for performing manipulations in the first place, but it seems like a good thing to include. </p>
<p>It seems to me that the first question we should ask is, &#8220;Why are you taking a photograph?&#8221; Why not draw it in pencil? Or paint it? Or record it as video? When the daguerreotype was first invented, it&#8217;s appeal was the degree of realism which it rendered. As additional technologies were developed which rendered a photographic image, the one which allowed for the greatest ease of reproducibility has consistently been the technology which became primary over other techniques. From the daguerrotype to the platinum print to the palladium print to the salt print, and all the way to the digital image. Another choice which has driven photographic methods has been portability. The civil war was photographed with cameras as large as a man which took ten minutes to set up. The most popular modern camera is so small it fits inside a device that has absolutely no relationship to visual imaging.</p>
<p>Are you taking photographs because you want to create images which are the easiest to share with others? Because it&#8217;s more portable than an easel, canvas and paintbrush? Because it is easier? Faster?</p>
<p>While there are many possible answers to that question, I think I could safely suggest that regardless of your &#8220;default&#8221; answer, that reason changes with each image you create. If that&#8217;s the case, then it stands to reason that there are times when &#8220;precisely recreating the scene as it was laid out&#8221; is not high on your agenda.</p>
<p>In those images whose purpose is other than attempting to reveal a &#8220;photographic truth&#8221; (a term I still think presumes far too much), why would we limit ourselves by what was laid out before us? It is a restraint we lay upon ourselves because we have a false belief in the inherent inviolability of the tool we have chosen to use.</p>
<p>This dovetails nicely into my original starting point, which is that when you make the effort of taking a photograph, you have limited your audience&#8217;s perception of the scene to only what is in the picture. The viewer assumes that you intended to make this image, and therefore supposes that every element of the image was intentional. </p>
<p>This, I think, is a strong argument for performing digital image manipulation.</p>

"event","<p>A blog article by <a href=""http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php"">Kevin Kelly</a> discusses an alternative model to the naive &#8220;Rock Star or Bust&#8221; business model which most professional artists work towards. Kelly&#8217;s model is referred to as &#8220;1000 True Fans&#8221; or the micro-patronage system.</p>
<p>The basic argument goes like this: if you can find 1000 fans who are willing to spend $100 per year on your work, then you&#8217;ll earn $100,000 gross income that year. Seeking that goal will actually generate more income, because for every True Fan (eg, who spends $100), you&#8217;ll have found other fans willing to pay less per year.</p>
<p>In seeking this goal, as opposed to the mass-media goals of pre-modern technological paradigms, a different set of marketing, development, and production technologies can be used quite efficiently.</p>
<p>This leads me back to my constant question of whether to pursue fine art or commercial photography. It seems like it is far easier for me to find fine art business models which I think I could effectively employ.</p>

<p>How important is intellectual property rights? Well, let me put it to you this way: They&#8217;re part of the US Constitution. Not the Bill of Rights, but the original document itself. In other words, the Founding Fathers thought that owning what you made was more important than Freedom of Speech. </p>
<p>That is why it pleases me that organizations like Pro Imaging are already leading the charge on the issues I wish I had more time to contribute to. They&#8217;ll review photo contest submission rules, and contact the organizers if they feel their terms and conditions are unfair to the photographers the organizations are trying to promote.

I've finally finished the Kitchen Fairies piece, thanks to some stunning insights from a watercolor artist I met at a party. I'm not entirely happy with the piece, since in the process of making it, I learned a dozen methods of initial image capture which would have created a better final image. Still, it looks pretty good on the small screen.

Therefore, you need to calculate your <a href=""http://www.nppa.org/professional_development/business_practices/cdb/cdbcalc.cfm"">Cost of Doing Business</a>, and the NPPA has a very useful online calculator for doing just that.

Once you know your CODB, you also need to know what a reasonable amount of time to earn that bare minimum is. Conventional wisdom suggests that a full-time commercial photographer will spend 100 to 120 days ""on set."" The rest of the time is spent getting work. Conventional wisdom (and this time I mean it as a sort of pun, as it is the wisdom I learned from the convention I attended last month) also suggests that working more than 120 days is a surefire way to give yourself a heart attack or a divorce.

So take your CODB and divide it by 100. This is the price you should set your ""Creative Fee"" at, and if you end up working 120 days, you've just earned 20*CODB profit."

During the <a href=""http://www.asmp.org"">ASMP</a>&#8217;s Strictly Business 2 tour, she gave a presentation on <i>Seven Steps to an Effective (and doable) Marketing Plan</i>.</p>
<p>Step One is to create what she calls a Vision Marketing Statement, which is basically an Artist&#8217;s Statement for people who want to actually make money with their art. With her permission, I repost certain segments of that speech here for the strangely large number of people who seem to be coming to my site looking for advice on writing an Artist&#8217;s Statement. For more tips, check the tag <a href=""http://www.amul.biz/news/category/photographic-philosophy/writing-tips/"">Writing Tips</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The following questions are designed to help you find a verbal method for describing your vision. Don&#8217;t over-think &#8212; answer them honestly and make sure they resonate with your own individual Truth. Don&#8217;t worry about being judged or sounding crazy &#8212; honesty in marketing goes a long way with persuading clients. You must tell your own story. How else can your business be any different and thus valuable to your market?
<ul>
<li>What do you love to shoot?</li>
<li>How do you love to shoot it/them? Maybe you love to shoot in existing/natural light or maybe you love highly-produced environments&#8230;or what about your approach, etc?</li>
<li>What do you bring to a project? Think about things like a sense of humor or conceptual thinking or connecting with your models, etc.</li>
<li>Who are your dream clients? Be very specific and list at least 5, like &#8220;American Express&#8221; or &#8220;New York Times Magazine,&#8221; or &#8220;Apple.&#8221;</li>
<li>Why did you become a photographer? What was the first spark that lit the fire?</li>
<li>List 5 words that describe your work (like &#8220;ethereal&#8221; or &#8220;hyper-real&#8221; or &#8220;clean&#8221; etc.).</li>
<li>List 5 words that describe you (like &#8220;energetic&#8221; or &#8220;intense&#8221; or &#8220;funny&#8221;).</li>
<li>What makes working with you different from working with any other photographer out there?</li>
</ul>

<p>I really enjoyed Leslie&#8217;s seminars, and continue to enjoy her podcast, <i>Creative Lube</i>, which you can find on her website along with her blog. Once I get a few hours to catch my breath and finish digesting the incredibly deep well of information that was SB2, you&#8217;ll be seeing my own answers to these questions, and the resultant VMS/Artist Statement.</p>
<p>If you are not a commercial photographer, and are having trouble converting these questions to apply to your own situation, leave a comment and I&#8217;ll try to help you out (although I think Leslie would tell you that it&#8217;d be better to ask some of your own friends to help with that process, since she&#8217;s always egging us creative professionals to get out of our studios).

<p>In Episode 12 of <a href=""http://www.photocastnetwork.com/2008/02/13/focus-ring-12-wear-a-low-cut-blouse/"">Focus Ring</a>, there is a really interesting conversation about the McNugget-style layout of image sharing sites like Flickr and Deviant Art: namely, every image is presented to you as a thumbnail before you can find the larger version.</p>
<p>On a site which hosts thousands, if not millions of images, then there&#8217;s a very real possibility that your images will primarily be seen at resolutions under 100&#215;100. If it does not strike a person&#8217;s interest in that size, they will most likely not click for the bigger version (which is still pretty damn small, as my preferred print size is twice the size of my already-large monitor).</p>
<p>Anyone who has created images will instantly understand the implications of this: there&#8217;s simply no way for such a small image to properly express the same sort of nuanced subtlety that a larger image can. The only way to grab anyone&#8217;s attention, the metaphor runs, is to wear a low-cut blouse. In other words, if your thumbnails aren&#8217;t provocative and alluring, then no one is going to look deeper at the larger scope. Extremely intricate work simply can&#8217;t compete on this minor scale.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by the larger implications of this. As artists earn greater hits and more numerous comments on their least delicate, most simplistic work, they&#8217;ll view this as encouragement to move in those directions&#8230;..</p>

"event","<p>A <a href=""http://www.amul.biz/news/2008/03/09/photoshop-certification-aids/"">few weeks ago</a>, I posted about the new study aids I&#8217;d found for the <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/support/certification/ace.html"">Adobe Certified Expert</a> Exam in CS2. I didn&#8217;t want to take a course, which would spend 90% of the time covering the things I already new, and I didn&#8217;t want a book for the same reason.</p>
<p>The test-based preparatory software seemed like an ideal solution for me. I didn&#8217;t need a refresher course on everything I knew, I needed to isolate what parts of my knowledge were insufficient, and aggressively target that knowledge. What better way to do that then to practice with questions that cover the exam objectives with questions in the same style as the test?</p>
<p>Between the two study aids of this type that I&#8217;d found, I decided to go with <a href=""http://www.ucertify.com/exams/Adobe/9A0-054.html"">uCertify</a> for three reasons: <a href=""http://examaids.com/progs_pscs2.html"">ExamAids</a> is listed in British pounds and I worried that there may be differences between the British and American versions of the test, uCertify offered a pre-purchase option on the CS3 exam (at a discount, no less), and then, to my delight, they <i>also</i> offered a &#8220;bulk&#8221; purchase discount when buying more than one program at once. End result? For less than <i>half</i> the price of one test, I could buy prep material for <i>both</i> the CS2 test and the CS3 recertification test. (<i>note: the CS3 version has now shipped, so that discount is no longer available</i>)</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a bit of full disclosure: shortly after making my purchase decision, someone from the uCertify PR team found the above-mentioned blog post where I debated between those two options, and emailed me, offering to let me try the software for free in exchange for a review. As I&#8217;d already placed the order with them, I agreed, but warned them that I&#8217;d give an honest review &#8212; so while I am writing this with that in mind, I am trying to be unbiased, if not downright antagonistic.</p>
<p>And as I said, I&#8217;d already made the decision to buy their software before they offered.</p>

"event","<p>Episode 18 of Paul Giguere&#8217;s excellent podcast, <a href=""http://paulgiguere.qb1.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=315365&#038;comments=on"">Thoughts on Photography</a>, does a great job of summarizing the primary points to consider when writing an Artist Statement or a Project Statement. Even better, he concisely explains the difference between the two.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to Paul&#8217;s podcasts practically since the first episode, having discovered him through the <a href=""http://www.studiolighting.net"">LightSource</a> podcast. His podcasts have a gentle, open and unabashedly reflective nature to them which makes them really worth listening to. I often struggle with the question of just how much of my artistic passion should I let show when talking about my photography, and I really think that Paul is an excellent role model for that question: he doesn&#8217;t let his passion consume him, but nor does he deny it. With his every spoken word on the subject, you can hear the comfortable acceptance of his love for what he does.</p>

"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"">For lack of more pressing things to do, I'll babble for a bit. <br />The carpet cleaner is here right now, I'm tired of hearing the drone of the damn cleaning machine! I'm confined to the living room, as all the carpeted rooms in the house are wet. I haven't done much of anything today, except read and cook a bit. I woke up, made some waffles (that turned out to be basically cookies made in a waffle maker) vacuumed the whole house for the carpet cleaner, read, made some damn good egg salad, and that's about it. Oh, and Teresa called me in her usual awkward manner and stammered about how she was wondering if I had written the article she had asked for yet. Of course I hadn't, she gave it to me about two days ago, but I BS-ed that and told her I'd have it sent in an hour. Apparently she liked it, according to her reply of exclamations. <br />I've been reading a lot lately. I finished The Elegant Universe, which was the best non-fiction book I've read in a while. I've been on a real non-fiction spin lately, right now I'm reading One Size Fits Few, by Susan Ohanian. It's completely random, but I figured it might give me a better sense of my mom's education jargon. So far, it has-to a point. It mostly talks about California and the school administrators there who are apparently all a bunch of morons and ass holes. The author actually makes what I thought would be a mind numbing subject somewhat humorous.&nbsp;<br /></p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Quote""><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Quote[I finally figured out how to do an lj cut]"">""Male baboons exchange greetings by yanking on each other's penis. I don't know how Fortune 500 CEOs, media pundits, and politicians greet each other, but I do know that only one percent of their DNA differs from that of baboons and that ninety-nine percent of what they say about public education is hooey. And worse. And if one hundred baboons sat in a computer lab, they'd produce <em>Moby Dick</em> sooner that one hundered CEOs would tell the truth about the relationship of their advocacy of one-size-fits-all educational standards to upsizing/outsizing their own salary packages, the sideswiping of middle- and working-class America, and the subsidy of state-of-the-scam sports stadiums with their corporate luxury suites, and the push for tax-supported vouchers to private education.""<br /></div></div><p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"">I only have about 25 pages left of that book, and my reading list for this summer keeps growing. I recently raided my mom's bookshelf and realized that she actually has very good taste in books. I took a few to read, and there are about 10 more that I will come back for. So far, my reading list for the recent future includes finishing My Ishmael, and reading: Radical Reflections by Mem Fox, The Golden Ratio by Mario Livio, and Jihad vs. McWorld: Terrorism's Challenge to Democracy by Benjamin R. Barber.&nbsp;<br />I really need some new music, my cd collection in my car is growing boring and my ipod converter for the car doesn't work well. I have a gift certificate to Barnes and Noble from my birthday, I think I'll probably go soon and spend it. I want to get The Only Thing I Ever Wanted album by Psapp, and Fidelity by Regina Spekktor. I also want to get a book on the Manu in Peru, I'd like to do some reading on where we are going&nbsp;before we leave.&nbsp;<br />Summer has been really great so far, a lack of urgent things to do is a luxury I lost for a while.</p>"

Actually-that's all I ever do here. Except for the ocassional shopping trip. The boys are hilarious as usual, and Alex is pretty funny too. Our meal last night was so funny, there's something really nice about sitting at the kids table. At our family reunion the boys made nicknames for everyone, they like using them a lot now. Madi is fatty madi, Harry is Scary Fairy Harry, and I am whorin' lauren, or borin' lauren? It's funny because they don't know what a whore is. Alex and Henry don't have nicknames. I'm reading freakanomics, it is very good. Goodnight."

"event","I love how music can change your mood in a moment. I wonder what my life would be like with out music. I mean, considering that I pretty much constantly have music playing, except for when I'm at school. I go to shows most weekends, and I've met a ton of my friends through shows. I love the way music can make you feel. Like, it can change your mood from one extreme to the other, even when nothing really has changed. I love how you can listen to a song you loved years ago and it brings back tons of memories. At least that's what it does for me.

I'm really going to miss writing while I'm in China. I am taking a travel journal though. My parents both do whenever they travel. And it's cool, they have an easy way to remember now what they did each day in Peru, Africa, India, and Australia. (Yes, my parents travel A LOT) I'm not sure how much time I will have to write though, on this trip. I think we are going to be running all day, and then coming back for only a short time before they have ""lights out."" Thats dumb that they have a time when you have to have lights out. I mean, if I turn the lights off and just sit when I'm not tired, it's almost a guarantee that I won't be able to sleep. For some reason, I just have to wait till I'm almost asleep and then shut off my light.

I'm really going to miss everyone around here too, friends and my parents. Not seeing my parents for two weeks won't be a big deal, though. For most people it might seem like it, but they are always traveling for long periods of time. When I was in like 5th grade they went to Hawaii for two weeks, 8th grade Peru for two weeks, 9th grade Africa for almost three weeks, then this year India for a little over two weeks, and my dad also went to Australia for three weeks. So I'm used to them being away. But it will be weird being away from everyone(including friends) for this long. I mean, it's only two weeks, but I don't know anyone who is going. It's not like I'll have anyone I can rely on except myself. I'm sure I'll meet people, but it will be really hard to fly a 14 hour flight and not know anyone on it. I'm really happy we are flying through Tokyo now though, Even if I just get to see Tokyo through the window, it will still be cool. I got good seats on the plane, an aisle from San Fransisco to Tokyo, and window from tokyo to Beijing. So I can sleep for the boring ride, and look out the window when there is something to see. I'm almost done packing, and things are looking good that I will have enough space to pack what I want. They changed the limit once again so I can now only bring 40 lbs. for my main suitcase, and a 10 lb. carry on. They said we can't do laundry there, so it should be interesting. I'm going to have to do some laundry in the sink in the hotel, my mom gave me this soap stuff for handwashing. I don't want to wear the same thing two time without washing it, especially since it is going to be super hot and sweaty there.

If anyone wants a postcard- be sure to give me your address before I leave. I will hopefully be able to send mail while I'm there.
Sincerely, 
Lauren"

"event","I leave for China in 9 days. I just recently realized that it is not infact two and a half weeks untill I leave, but just over one week. I am most definately not ready at all for the trip. I need shoes and a bag to bring-apparently the bag I was going to bring as a purse isn't good enough because it doesn't have a zipper. 
I am super nervous for the plane ride. If I actually suceed at getting to San Fransico by myself, which will be interesting as I'm flying through Chicago which has an enormous aiprport, I have to find the baggage claim there(in SF) and find the people who are taking me to University of California-San Fran. Then I go and check in there and start meeting people. We stay at the University one night before we leave for Shanghai. The plane ride is 14 HOURS. The longest I've ever been on was to Hawaii which was only about 8 hours. I hope I can get an asle seat on the plane, otherwise I'm going to die. My legs are always skwished in all the seats, but at least an asle seat is a little better.
This is the itinerary of what I will be doing: http://lead-america.org/conferences/wylc/china_itinerary.html
This summer is going so so soooo fast. After I get home from China, there will be just one more month untill school begins. And a week of that I will be spending in Vermont for my Craftsbury camp. The camp should be really fun. We have 14 on the water sessions over the course of 5 days. The camp is on this great lake with smooth water. I'm excited to get better at sculling. 
Last night I went to Ihop and Barnes and Noble with Emily, Jaci and Sean. It was really random. We showed up at ihop, realized none of us had money to spend, and then left to go to Barnes and Noble. We went there and Emily saw a car that looked a lot like hers-but she was driving the van that night. And it turned out it was her sister, Stephanie. We went in and Emily called her. We got coffee and a brownie there, and Stephanie and her friends were on their way to leave. Matt came back in and was like ""The van isn't starting"" So we all went outside to see what was the problem. The engine wasn't even turning over, and we couldn't figure out what was wrong. Steph called their parents and her dad got all mad thinking that she did something to mess the car up. Long story short I completely missed my curfew. But whatever, my mom didn't really care-she was pretty much passed out.
Today I am hanging out with Abby and Aubrey. It seems like we don't hang out nearly as much anymore. It kind of sucks. Later tonight I'm going over to Brittany's house for a party. It should be fun. 
I have a bunch of bugbites, eww. They are almost all from the fireworks at Elkhart. We attempted to watch them, but after the first few there was an accident and they all blew up in this giant cloud of black smoke. The boat they were launched off of was spinning around like crazy! The fireworks injured 6 people, and one flew into the crowd at a Rehersal Dinner at Seibkins. The bride to be got sever burns all over her hands and stomach. She was supposed to get married the next day, but now she's in the hosital. That's horrible."

I just looked at my computer calender. I thought it was 2 and a half weeks. I am not ready at all. My grandpa also wanted me to help him with sudoku. Dammit there's no food in the house except brownies and deviled eggs.

"event","I was supposed to go to Brianne's cabin tommorow. I told her I couldn't. I guess I could have, but we leave Thursday or Friday for Elkhart for a week, and then on the 15th I leave for China, and I NEED to start getting ready for it. I need to start shopping for clothes that will be comfortable to wear in 90 degree China weather, that are also addherent to the dress code for the trip. My mom is so tired of shopping for China the other day she was just like ""Who cares if you ever wear them again? I don't really give a damn anymore, we'll donate them after you get back.""

We are leaving for Elkhart Thursday or Friday, I'm not sure how that will go. It's fun for the first few days...but then it generally gets old hanging out with Maggie and whoever she brings along. Last year I swear we went to Wal-Mart or ""Went to Wal-Mart"" at LEAST 3 times a day, no exageration. And then the'd drive like maniacs-one time they decided to see just how fast Maggies car could go-she didn't even have her license yet, and she went 150mph! It was scary. Madi and I were in the back seat, and I think we both thought we were gonna die or something.

I got back last night from Madison. I was there for the Badger State Regatta. It was really fun-Lars, Linda Gruber, Anne, Cora and I drove down Friday and met Maggie to stay at Linda Maier's house for the night. On the way, Lars car overheated and we had to stop. We stopped at what we thought was a gas station (The entrance and sign were facing away from the highway) It turned out to be a bar. The bar was called ""Kinda Country"" and it was pretty weird. As we got out of the car these ""biker boys"" rolled in on their Harleys. The bar had this giant ""Bikers welcome!"" sign in the front. We popped the hood to Lars car, and the coolant was bubbling through the overflow. We used the contents of my water bottle as temporary coolant, and went inside to wait for the engine to cool. We walked in, and only one of us was actually 21 (Cora) but they didn't check our I.D's. We had nothing better to do so we played darts.....and found out just how amazing I am at darts(not very) We finally got back on the road, and got to Madison ok. There were a lot of earwigs on the floor at Lindas, but Maggie and I stole the beds so it was ok. The races went pretty well. I was in the Novice 4, the open womens 4, and the open womens 8 and mixed 8. I stroked all of them, so it sort of sucked. We got 2nd in our Novice 4, and the mixed 8 took 3rd, which was really good, especially since Allison from Appelton rowed with us for Katie because she was sick. Steve coxed our womens 8, or ""Stephanie"" as we called him. It was really funny, he wore a tiara for the whole race. At the start line everyone was laughing, he looked ridiculous. 

That's all JAMIE."

My plan for next year is to disappear off the face of the earth for the last few weeks of school. Or something like that. I have a regatta on the 12th in Waterloo, Iowa, and I have another on the 26th in Madison. I haven't been to morning practice in about 3 weeks, and the races are only a week and a half away...I don't even know if I'm going to Waterloo anymore. I hate long car rides. Ugh. I'm not going to Boston anymore, and possibly not New york, because my schedule is dumb. I guess we are spending some extra time in Boston instead in October when my dad goes there for the Head Of the Charles race. I'm excited to watch the race, it should be fun."

"event","The past 3 days have been like a friggin hell. I haven't really slept so it has just felt like some giant shitty super super long day. I really hate school lately...I've been counting down the minutes practically. I only have 7 more full days left, though, and 7 more half days. Thers 2 days of senior exams, 3 days of hours, I miss half a day in milwaukee, and dai la bai fest. Concert under the lights is next week. I just realized that spring week is next week. I'm going to miss part of it when I'm in Mikwaukee, and I think I'm going to have to miss the Concert under the lights to do service hours, I still need like 6 more. I did 4 at St. Vincent the other day and I thought I was going to die. Maleeka Cross is such a sweet name, she's like the manager at St. Vincent De Paul. She looks like she's in some latino gang or something, haha she has all these crazy tatoos. She was really crabby at first but I guess she started to like us, she gave us a fifteen minute break from working and let us go up into the workers lunch room. We had to go up in this weird old elevator. It made me feel insane. It looked like something from some scary movie in an insane asylum. Then when we got up there we were like ungodly thirsty, and Maleeka gave us popcorn and bought us both sodas. 
Tonight Jamie, Ryan, Jennifer and I went to the show in Shawano. Jamie and Ryan both played, and mostly the rest of the music was like these wanna be metal bands. In one of the bands the like grandpa or father or something played the bass because their usual bassist wasn't there. He looked pretty ridiculous playing. Jamie gave me a birthday present-Joanna Newsom-The Milk Eyed Mender, A mix tape, and a sweet drawing. I'm listening to the music right now. 
My eyes really itch, and my one eye hurts-ryan threw a paper thing at me and it hit me in the eye.
I'm tiredish ughhh
I don't want to go to bed, tommorrow is going to be busy."

I decided that this summer is going to feel about as fast as a week, and junior year is going to suck. I have no clue why I signed up for impossible classes, honestly. I'm taking CC Calc 1, Honors History, Advanced Bio, Spanish3, Theo, Pyschology, and Honors Chem. I don't quite understand why they fired 7 teachers but added a hockey team. But that's just me. 
It feels like I'm going to be home about a week this summer. And school is almost over. Theres 19 days left, including finals. I'm going to Coheed and Cambria next Tuesday with Jennifer, and missing Tuesday and Wendnesday of school. Then on that thurday I'm going to Waukesha for this college thing for Brown and Columbia or something? I have no clue why, considering I'm only a friggin sophmore. Then on the 23 I take my driving test, then finals then schools over. I'm pretty much not going to be home at all this summer, The weekend school gets out is Celebrate, then the most likely the day after memorial day we're leaving to go to New York, Providence, and Boston, again pretty pointless because I'm only a sophmore and all the schools were going there to see are the hard-core impossible to get in type. My mom is crazy gungho on college. The words ""You should look at Harvard for fun"" have come out of her mouth. When we get back theres Warped Tour on the 17th I think, if I actually end up going unlike last year ughhh, and then Badger games on the 26th, and then were going to elkhart for the family reunion for the 4th for about a week. A week and a half later I leave for china for 2 weeks! I kind of have mixed feelings about it. Like....I really wanted to go in the begining and I guess I will be excited when it's closer but I'm flying out to San Fransisco by myself, which will be interesting. Unless of course the other girl from Wisconsin who's going flys out with me, which should also be interesting because she sounded like she's already traveled the country. Her mom called my house and told me her life story pretty much, for about 20 minutes. Then I'll be in vermont a week in august, and then school starts a few weeks later. I can't believe in 3 weeks sophmore year is over, and I'll be half done with highschool. It's crazy. I never see Aldo people anymore either. That sucks. I see Abby, and Aubrey when she's not at her dads. But I haven't seen Amanda, Amber, or any of those people in forever. The only times I see some of those people lately it seems like is at shows. A little over a week ago was when I had a bunch of aldo people over. That was when everyone still hung out a lot, I think they should more. I think it's weird that in 2 years a lot of people will go to college all over and I won't see them ever. I think it's weird that the people that I spend a ton of time with now, I probably will see them barely ever in just a few years. 

I hate when people treat you like your obviously retarted if you're not in college yet. 

This was pointlessssssss."

"event","I decided to join the new trend and make a new livejournal......we'll see if I actually use it.

Today was so long. I woke up at 6:30 for practice and decided I was going to skip, went back to bed till 9, then went to St. Norberts to do service hours. They had bagels so big they fit around your wrist there. I was supposed to babysit the ""crazy neighbors"" with Jaci till 6, but only 2 kids were there so I stayed home. The kids are crazy, the one girl-Chloe- strips people. She like...pulls peoples pants down and pulls their shirt off. And she's 7 years old. The 3 other kids are just normal devil kids. I ended up going to Abby's for a while before Sami's party, to see her and Aubrey-who I never see anymore. I finally got to give Aubrey her Christmas present. Yeah, in April. 2 of Abby's friends came over, Kendra and Tiffany, and we went to Hansons. They went out partying and I went to Sam's at about 8, and realized I am ridiculously good at poker. Haha, not. It was a good time, we randomly played pretty much every game possible, and then Katie, Jaci, and I drove home. I got to walk home from the edge of the road, because Katie was afraid she'd end up in the ditch.(This has happened before) 

I think I have asthma. All day I've been wheezing. Like I can't exhale fast and it makes this scweaking noise. Ughh. I wish I could've gone to the show tonight, Patterns won't be back untill May, I believe.

I've been listening to 95.9 lately. I have no clue why. Rap is funny.

Someone come to my house tommorow and eat my cake. I have a ton of cake at my house. Like, a giant cake and a half of another. 

So this entry is pointless, but I have decided-It is now cool to ramble about your day in Livejournals.

I'm all confused all over again, thanks to KATE. Asldkgjfldk."

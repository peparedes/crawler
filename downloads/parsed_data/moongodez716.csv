"event","hello world.  how is everyone?  where do i start...i dont think i will start as in start to pour out my life story and what has happened every day of the last 6 months or so, but I will start by saying a lot has changed.  i have changed.  i am happier, heathier, more alive.  it has all done a full turn from the last journal entries i used to suject you too...sorry.  but i'm thinking i'll update occasionally because some of my greatest friends have expressed that they'd like to keep up on my life and do it through the LJ.  anyway, i'm single.  it's by choice but i dont know who or what or how i want to be with anyone anymore.  all my feelings have flipped and these days i seek independence, happiness within my self, and enjoy being alone with myself and having my alone time.  i'm not to broke and have been praticing the art of shopping!  my family life is wonderful and my parents are the most precious things to me in my life.  i love my room mates, my apartment, my room, and really my life right now.  thats all i'm going to write for now so see ya.

"event","wow, i am very much in love.  although, the difference this time is i'm loved sucessfully in return.  i believe that boy loves me more than anything in his life, which at times seems burdensome, but when i step back and look at things from a overall what i want in a relationship angel, things seem to good to be true.  he listens...to me cry, ponder life while trippin on shrooms, to my stupid pointless stories, to my stoner thoughts that go no where, to my insanely high pitched excited voice, to me complain about being zitty and fat and all he says is: ""erica, i love you, you're perfect, and even when you're not i still love you.""  i dont have to wear make-up infront of him, i dont have to smell good, i dont have to do or be anything i dont want to do or be, and i love him.  sometimes i want to kill him for being jealous and over-protective and time consuming, but i love him regardless.  when thsi whole thing started, i was head over heals.  as we progressed, i had my doubts.  when looking at what an awsome weekend and time we have together when he's close, i'm so happy.  and now, when i think of him far away, i want to cry.  i'm probably annoying those who have read this far, so thank you and i'll stop now.

"event","i have to say this:  the blackout, sweet.  my brother and i treated it like it was a two day hippy camping trip.  from the minute we found out what a big deal it was that the whole block/city/east coast was involved, we went straight where everyone else in detroit thought the most important place to go was: the corner liquor store.  we got a six pack each and a pint of jack and well, figured we had nothing better to do but to get drunk, smoke bud, and go swimming.  and this my friends, is what we did.  the night time was shitty though cause it was WAY hot and we were not drunk anymore when we woke up at 3am...4am...5am... yea.  well the next morning chris and i awoke to a case of beer chillin in the cooler that my dad scored from our neighborhood bar.  this was not random, Cals bar is like a major part of the handloseres history, its where my mom and dad met.  so the owner hooked my dad up with ice and beer, which were the two biggest things in demand and once again...we drank and smoked and cured our borem with a nice crunked day in the sun.  our neighbors hung out and drank wine with us, we threw a combined backyard bbq and the food was damn good.  when the power went back on around 7, i have to admit, i was upset our vacation was over.  as a family, especially the handlosers, we could have turned against each other in the hot and drunked state we were in, but we didn't.  we all bonded and went into survival mode with lots of laughs and ejoyed the outdoors together.  also, having a puppy when you have nothing else to do is WAY amusing.  i also finished a book: swimming sweet arrow.  its a soft porn, but a very interesting coming of age story.  my reaction when the lights came back on:  damn... i was really ejoying myself.

on another note:  i have yet to talked to rory and bethy which i've heard have moved into our new apartment.  i've been applying for jobs and OH MAN HELL YEA in the process of buying a cell phone.  i'm very excited i will no longer have to ask anyone for:

a) a ride
b) if they have free nights and weekends
c) if i can even use their phone

exciting.  

all is well.  love you guys.

my puppy:  i dont know if he's cuter than jimi hendrix handloser was, but he's SO DAMN CUTE.  jimi was just a work of puppy art so i cant even hold charlie up to those standards, its cruel.  he's an english springer spaniel and lab mix and he looks like the pokey little puppy.  as of now, he sleeps with me and loves to be held like a baby.  he's only 8 weeks so he still likes to cuddle and be held.  HE'S ADORABLE AND I LOVE HIM!

kevin and i had the most bad ass weekend in myrtle beach.  we went miniture golfing, to a haunted house, and he cooked me dinner, MEXICAN FOOD, all in one fuckin day!  he bought a pint of jack, a pint of captain, and a 6 pack of killians and the plan was to eat a lot of good food and get crunked.  the plan was executed immediately and successfully.  we went swimming in the ocean, swimming in the pool, swimming in the jacuzzi...ahh, i could talk about this weekend forever.  the hotels, the city, him, all the little things that were said, the pictures, the dinner, the card exchange we did...everything was perfect.  so i'll stop making you ill now...lol

my brother:  we're cool again but its different.  he's really angry with himself or life or something and just snaps like a crazy person when ever he wants and i cant handle that.  we smoke and chilled last night but not a lot was said, just a lot of talk about the puppy.  i just want him to be happy so i think i'll pray for him a lot.  

i move up to the mountain on the 22nd and i'm excited to decorate my room and the apartment.  i have so much to do thought its gonna be rediculous, plus work as much as possible so i have money.  

thanks for listening

SOMEONE SHOULD TELL HIM TO BE CONSIDERATE OF OUR MOTHER SINCE HE'S BROKE EVERY SINGLE REQUEST SHE ASKED OF HIM THUS FAR BEING HOME.  SOMEONE SHOULD TELL HIM TO COOK HIS OWN FOOD, SLEEP IN HIS OWN ROOM WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONING, DRIVE HIS OWN CAR, COME UP WITH HIS OWN SOURCE OF INCOME, PAY BILLS, GO TO SCHOOL, HOLD A JOB, BE A MAN NOT A BABY.  ABOVE ALL:  SOMEONE SHOULD REALLY FUCKING TELL HIM TO NOT SAY ""HATE"" TO A LOVED ONE BECAUSE ITS ALMOST UNFORGIVABLE.  FUCK MY FUCKING ASSHOLE DICK OF A BROTHER!!!  WELCOME HOME PRICK.

"event","i'm really anxious tonight.  tnt's romantic comedy movies aren't helping much either.  they got me thinking too much about love.  and fairy tales and all those dreams little girls have that some how get washed away as we get older...or maybe just pushed deep down inside due to our generations tendency of over loading on reality.  well, i know i've lost my male readers attention...lol  but it kinda sucks not being in love, or thinking about the possibilty of being in love, or thinking maybe you are in love but cant do shit about it, or stuck in a love with someone you should not be loving, or so many sernerios that whether they feel wrong, right, good, or bad, at least you're feeling.  passion possesses you and it becomes almost like a friend.  when it's not there, you notice and wonder where its gone and when it'll be returning.  especially me, a girl who loves to love and be in love and is even learning how to deal with lost love with hopes of new love.  it's not even a person i want, its just that feeling or having your friend back.  now, i'm not going to make some stupid and needy attempt to fill this void.  i'm just recognizing its there.  i feel like i'm just standing still.  and maybe thats a great thing for me to be doing right now in my life because i get lost when my heart is going faster than my head, but standing still at times can be quite empty."

talked to rors a lot today
rory and i and company are going to have a BAD ASS vacation in 8 days.  8 days.  oh man...nothing but glee shooting from this smile when i think about how fun its going to be and how much alcohol i'm going to consume
canada has new pot laws *lets pause and take a moment of refelection and gratitude for canada*  i actually did it...
i bought something tiny, red, and sexy for my birthday and wow, i'm in love.  
i miss boys.  being around them.  their smell.  contact.  their humor.  yea, and of course...sex...blah blah i miss sex, whats fuckin new.
i was just about to type like 3 other thoughts but i realized i would have put my foot in my mouth big time with 2 out of 3 of them so i think i'll stop here.

babysitting bull shit.  cancelations!  do i get to stay or do i have to go home???  do you want me to watch your kids or what???  what time tomorrow morning??? cancelations?!  a mouth full from my mom, then having to calm her and everyone else down in between dry heaving over nastiest toilet ever!  it was work...  but all worked out in my favor because i got to keep being hung over instead of pushing myself to drive home due to the flakiness of my employers and smoke and take a nap.  

last night was incrediable.  actually the last couple day have just been incrediable.  see, i dont get out much...lol  but the last couple nights have been just jam packed friends and my brother and of course partying with a id that says i'm 22 that i got to use with no problem.  i got to see parr and kat for fireworks, old friends from msu, new people...good times.  and i've been talking to...

gotta end this.  just got asked to puff a bowl

anyway, it was great to see you parr and kat.  i love you both and it made my night.  i woke up this morning and i was like, why do i feel so bad? and then i was like, OH MAN I DID A KEG STAND!!! lol

"event","I post in this thing like once every two years. Normally when I'm really upset. Today, I was just dicking around online and have decided to post? Fuck it, its 5:34 and I'm watching shin Chan. So my pc is fucked. My hard drive is busted, and can't be fixed. I did get a loaner for the time being. I can honestly say other than that, not much else in my life at the moment is bad. I mean, since my last post (roughly two years ago or so) I have achieved an associates degree in animation, and enrolled in a new school to get my bachelors degree in game design, and will hopefully be getting that accomplished soon, and be able to start my own company (if I can't do that without my degree.) I've also been considering trying out music, with a hip hop group, because I used to like to write rhymes alot, turns out I can't do it as well as I used to. I've also been considering trying sketch comedy, because I think that could be fun. And I've been considering trying to start a podcast. I know that one seems stupid than the other ones, but I've always enjoyed listening to talk radio, and that's all this is. I can talk for an hour about nothing. Plus I think I'm funny, and fuck you if you don't. Who knows where life will lead. I'm engaged to be married to one if the most amazing people I have ever met. She's great, and I couldn't in a million years think of enough words in the English language to describe her. We recently got an apartment with one of our closest friends, who (for the two days or so she was here before she left) seems to be a good roommate so far. While I have my worries about the apartment(like being constantly broke now, or not being able to support my woman), I enjoy being here. I enjoy the area and the actual apartment is really nice. Hmmm.. Other than that, I would like to quit smoking. I don't like doing it and I don't like the way it makes me feel. Feeling dependant on a substance to feel ""normal"" isn't a good feeling. Not to mention having lost three major people in my life to cancer and knowing what it puts the family through as well as yourself, is another reason I want to quit. Bah. I feel like I've said a lot, and also not said enough at the same time. Well it seems as if I have been typing for over a half hour on my phone and its killing my fucking fingers. That and I'm chubby tired. So good night world?"

"event","You were right about posting all of those entries about me not needing you.
But it's not why you think it is. 
Go a head and blame me getting a girlfriend if that makes you feel better.
When honestly your constant inconsideration is what did it.
It was pretty bad before, and I was willing to ignore it to an extent when it was stupid little shit like going to eat somewhere late at night and not inviting us or going to the movies or something. It didn't bother me because Mel and I would go to the movies and not always invite you.
But then when I got into the car accident and told you that my Melissa was hurt, and you didn't even call or text her to ask if she was okay or how she was feeling, or just to say what's up for so long. That is un-fucking excusable. 
You're the most self-centered person I know and you drove me away because of it. 
God forbid I didn't see you for a few days a week, because I'd have to feel your wrath the next time we hung out. It's not that I didn't like hanging out, it was that I do have other friends and shit that I like to do that doesn't always involve you. 

You say you hate me, You're disappointed in someone, you miss someone but the old them.
It's funny how when you don't like someone they have changed, yet someone who i've spent every day for the last year and a half around hasn't noticed a change in me. Nor have any of my other friends. 
I'm not fucking stupid. Sorry I finally was able to stand up for myself. Sorry I have a life not revolving around you, and that yes, I will live on without you."

"event","Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Where the fuck should I start with my amazing weekend?.. Probably Thursday.. So Thursday.. I hung out with Dave Tina and Mel for a while cause it was Dave's birthday. We hung out and eventually went and got Jake, and went to Mel's to go and eat Fajita's, which were pretty damn awesome :), and watched American Idol, then started to watch Are you Smarter then A Fifth Grader.. Which was amusing. We went to Tina's and finished up the show, then went to jake's and dave came over again. We started watching Futurama, and I died on the couch.. Like.. Just passed the fuck out, until about four in the morning, then got up moved couches and went to sleep until ten. After I got up, bunch of non-sense went on that isn't necesary to be typed. Went to guitar center and shit and went to jake's for a while, went and got mel and went to see black snake moan which was a pretty good movie :). We then proceded to walmart for a while, then went to meijer met up with dave, and at about 230, we went to Ram's Horn, where we stayed, were loud and obnoxious, for about another two hours.. not wanting to return to my home at 430 in the morning, Mel and I went and stayed at Daves house, where we went to bed at 7, got up at 8.. then all passed out until 230ish :) Got up, took mel home, and went to my aunts.. came home, did some homework, then went got mel and went to the mall.. ended up back at my aunts house, and watched a movie.. now i'm at home doing nothing as always :) I dunno.. This past weekend was just great.. I really had a fun time and I really look forward to what may possibly occur next week and or weekend... :)"

"event","So the past few days have been soo awesome, it's almost surreal. Friday, I went to the mall with Jake Tina and my cousin and her friends. I bought two cd's.

Dir En Grey-The Marrow Of a Bone
Dir En Grey is a metal band from Japan. A lot of the cd is in japanese, but the music is still absolutely fuckin' amazing. The whole cd is just fuckin' great. :) 
The Showdown-Temptation Come My Way
The Showdown are Christian Cock Rock. That's how it was described in revolver.. so I'm not going to arugue. Favorite part of that cd is the cover of Carry on My Wayward Son.

Anyways, after that I showered and got Mel after about three episodes of Futurama, and went and got Mel :) and we went to go see the Abandoned. Which was a pretty bad ass movie, unless you fall asleep and blood curdling screams ensue. After we went to Rams Horn for an hourish.. and had a lot of fun :0) 

Today I kinda just sat around all day. I went to the grocery store with my mom, then went to get mel. We went to the mall and walked around for a bit, then went over to Best Buy where i happened to run into the Threat Signal cd..

Threat Signal- Under Reprisal
Cd is pretty fuckin' sweet. Sounds a lot like Lamb Of God with actual vocal melody.. It's pretty awesome.

We were going to the movies but ended up renting one and going back to dave's house instead. :) it was fun. These past few nights have just been great.. :)"

I didn't realize how bad it was until I had spent a night in the hospital with her.. it was a really bad night.... ummmmmm Finally done with the fuckin' bitch i dated for three years, Left me again for another ""Friend"".. I tried to maintain some sort of friendship with her.. but it never would have happend.. Ummm.. since then, i have come in contact with someone from my past... someone that i really like... someone i spend ALOT of time with, but i'm okay with that... Nothing really exciting has happend other then what was stated.. other then the current talk in progress... doesn't really matter though.. Life is getting better, because I reached lows i never thought possible... Only way to go is up.. not sure if i'll post regularly or not.. but i may.. so WOOT i dunno :)"

Full Blown Chaos-Strength Within

There comes a time for everyone
To fall back or stand your ground
Fight or flight - Do or die
You never fail if you try

Everyday we rise and fall
Sometimes we lose our way
Never bend to another's will
Courage is all we need

STRENGTH WITHIN

Make every second count
Lost time can't be reclaimed
Live every day like it's your last
And regret will have no meaning

Leave mistakes in the past
We live to learn and overcome
Yesterday has come and gone
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow

STRENGTH WITHIN
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow

Everyday we rise and fall
Sometimes we lose our way
We take a chance with every breath
How can we win if there's nothing to lose

Leave mistakes in the past
We live to learn and overcome
Yesterday has come and gone
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow

SHOT HIS OWN FUCKING SISTER.. OVER ICE.... and.. fucking cops.. NEW ORLEANS POLICE.. shot at the fucking contracters comming to fix all the shit... is it just me or can anyone else see that the Apocolypse is at hand?.. Look at all these devastating things that have come about... all these storms... too much more as well.. oh well.. if the world comes to an end.. at least i dont need to get a job =) anyways.. after that i feel much better.. i just felt so fucking.. angry after seeing shame on bush... i seem to forget that the man in control of the us controls the weather.. ugh.. and it isnt that i dont like bush.. i have nothing against him... just fucking ppl.. stupid fucking ppl... when something goes wrong blame bush... ooops i broke a nail.. fucking bush... fuck ppl.."

Bury Your Dead was on.. they were good.. Wicked Wisdom went on.. but they got booed off.. meh.. well.. i dont remember alot of the other bands.. but Soilwork rocked.. Arch Enemy.. Excellent... Trivium...(shoots again) dear jesus.. they are awesome.. and i cant wait until november... Trivium and Children Of Bodom... oOoOoOoOo.. then KsE...

Mastodon had to cancel at our show.. but its oaky.. they had a good reason... death in the family.. then Rob Zombie.. he was excellent as always.. he covered Cat Scratch Fever.. sweet.. then In Flames was on main stage.. we headed that way and Lynn needed to meet up with her sister and mom.. so she wanted me to go with her.. and i did.. so we went and got them.. and went back to the hill.. we watched them.. and BLS.. and then Shadows Fall came on.. They were great.. 4th time seeing them.. they were sweet.. and we waited for Mudvayne to come on.. :) they were excellent.. and i found my first tatoo.. their new symbol or something.... its a spinal chord.. with two heads on the top.. it has cross bones on the bottom of the chord.. and one head has devil horns and the other head has the thorn crown.. it was so cool.. anyways.. they put on a good show.. i sat down cause i didnt feel good.. but i still listened... and i almost cried when they played Forget to Remember.. the lyrics.. remind me of cort.. during that song.. Lynn asked me if i was a depressed emo boy.. but i said no.. even though i was about to cry.. i dont care about the comment.. she didnt know.. and i didnt want to tell her.. so its okay..:) anyways.. they put on a good show... then Iron Maiden went on.. they were really good.. i was kinda suprised.. but i wasnt.. i was more suprised at the fact that they have three guitar players and a bass player.. they put on a good show.. and then Sabbath went on.. they were good for the three songs that we stayed.. then we left.. anyways... everything is oaky. and i dont like it.. i dont know why im okay.. but things.. i dont know.. i just dont know.. ehh.. i think im just lost.. i need to figure out who i am.. i think that im going to just tear myself down peice by peice and figure me out again.. i need to know who i am.. things are just confusing to me at the moment.. i need to get my shit together.. and get my life back on track.. :-/ ah well.. ill figure it all out.. sooner or later.. i just dont know.. meh.."

Whenever i think my life is going to be fine and i might make it through, I lose all hope and will. I just dont understand. I just once dont want to make the comment that fucks up everything, i dont even want to think it. I want to be numb. Not the way i was, but like, almost mentally handicapped. Ignorance is bliss so they say, well i want to be ignorant to EVERYTHING. So this way, i wouldnt make comments, i wouldnt have an opinion, nothing. just nothing. which is what im going to amount to be at this rate. i feel like such a fucking loser. no job, no school, no ambition, no will.. im just a  waste of fucking life with little will to carry on. On the Brighter side i guess... i just found out that at Sounds of The Underground, almost all the bands will be having a meet and greet... SO i will get to meet some of my musical influences.

Was loads of fun, with the exception of the few cock sucking friends i had who left to go watch a movie.. so that was cool. made some good green there too.. my uncle got plastered and we all wrote on him. anyways getting side tracked. back to the good things in life right now.. i graduated, dont have a job, have a girlfriend whom i love and loves me back... and almost everything else is.. okay in my life at the moment... yet i feel so discontent... like nothing is where it belongs... i feel so... angry so much.. like i once used too.. like my freshman year angry..like.. put two more holes in my wall in less then a week..... just things havent been sitting well with me.. i mean.. is it normal to ram your head through the wall.. i mean litterally?i also punched my wall on a more recent freak out.. things were not good at all that day.. for some reason me and cortney started fighting.. and it was bad.. i was walking around.. just HATING my very existance.... and just feeling stupid, which is a word i use in place of suicide or suicidal, because those very words have absolutely no meaning in todays society. but the thing was.. i had no real reason for feeling that way. we started fighting about her getting a camera. i didnt want her to get one.. and it is really stupid as to why.. jealousy. anyways, i was in a generally shitty mood.. and we just started fighting after my mom left... it went on almost all night.. i felt kinda like she didnt care about me.. she made a comment about me not wanting her to get the camera.. anyways.. i went into my room and wanted to be alone.. so i could think and stuff.. and she came up.. she started bugging me and i made a comment about my wanting to do something stupid.. and she pinched my arm fat...i got angry.. asked her to get off of me.. wont lie either.. i was so upset at this point i was crying.. and as i begged for her to leave me alone.. she wouldnt.. i became frustrated and threw her off of me...that made me feel like shit.. cause then i knew i had freaked her out.. it was really bad... then i like broke down and cried harder then i have before...especially in front of someone.. at this point she tried to ask me what was wrong and i punched the wall...i just dont like the way things are going in my life at the moment.. i hate me for some of the things that i have done.. and some of the things i wont do, like be serious about getting a job..... Blah.. i am exhausted.. i might go to bed soon...anyways.. got about two weeks before sounds of the underground.. excited.. probably will post after that.. peace love niggas!!"

I am already dead... to far away to be saved, not far enough away to be actually dead... i just exsist.. im no longer here... dead inside... oh well.. that's my life..people move on... nothing to see here.. not that what you see isn't entertaining.. 



Sorry.. just not in a good mood.. read a live journal that upset me.. about my ex... she reads other peoples journals.. but not mine.. not that she has to.. but she even told me that she never reads it... when i read hers every day.... oh well... i dont know if i want anymore human contact.. i think im going to just find a hole and crawl in... i cant deal with people anymore... and in the words of the great band Lamb of God, "" I'd rip out my own entrails by hand just to be all alone."" Sometimes that seems like a good idea........."

Scott's GF Sara and two of her friends, jenny and tori, came over and we all sat down and watched The Happiness of the Katakuri's. That was the most emotionally disturbing, fucked up, happy thing that i have ever seen... it didnt matter what was going on there was always this overly happy music playing... it was weird... and a musical.. anyways other then that not much has been going on.. picked up a couch myself yesterday. getting rid of it cause the dog ate it. anyways nothing else to post at the moment..

"event","I havent posted in like over a month now... so lets see where do i start.. I think the last time i posted was the friday or thursday before i went to see slipknot... well that was a kick ass show.. Shadows Fall was great.. they started by playing the intro to ACDC for those about to rock.. and rock they did... Lamb Of God was SO ridiculously great.. they were consistant... recognized every song..then slipknot played.. although not much of a sliipknot enthusist as i once was...they still put on a great show... and were really sweey anyways.. but one member had family emergency so he wasnt there... and Chris, the guy with the dildo looking nose broke his leg.. or injured it at least... so they still put on a good show.. they were just as good as LoG just they had more theatrics... then a few weeks weny by... and me and my gf were working on some issues.. and still are.. but we are okay.. we were off and on for a while and we have steadied and are working on our last few things... anyways.. a few weeks went by and then i went to see Blood Simple, American Head Charge, Life Of Agony, and Mudvayne.. Mudvayne and AHC were fucking great.. blood simple were decent.. and life of agony.. what a fuckin shitty band.. i fell asleep during their concert.. it was boring.. and then mudvayne came on.. they were so awesome... and i found out last week that they are the last headlining act on Ozzfest... with Shadows Fall and Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, and BLS...oh godd.. im so going though.. i think MIke and Scott are going... as well as hopefully the girlfriend and my cousin.. so i think thats about all that has been happening.. we had spring break last week.. spent all but two days with my gf. we played video games like the whole time :). went and practiced at mikes yesterday, trying to see if either of us can sing.. like metal style... and i cant scream well.. but i was singing All That Remains-Focus Shall Not Fail, and there is a good melodic part in there.. and i sang it kinda under my breath and mike heard me.. and he was like.. i think you almost got it.. and then i sang it louder and he was like wow you sing well.. and it was good.. so i shall sing any melodic parts for our songs.. so that was sweet...well anyways.. i got not much else as far as i know... so ill post later... Love Peace and Chicken Grease People~Bryan"

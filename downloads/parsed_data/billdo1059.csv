"event","Wow....Been a while since I have updated this thing so im gonna summarize the last few weeks for ya. 

We got hit by a fucking hurricane! Me being the dumbass I sometimes am decided to go driving down 419 while the wind was blowing 70 plus mph in my truck. Let me tell ya my 250 is a bad bitch, it didnt even get pushed off the road a lil, I was proud of her. Chulouta got fucked up bad...well preety much oviedo geneva and all of central FL did. 

I got a new job, where do you ask? This lil Itialian restraunt called Papa Joes. Its a preety badass job and I make decent money.

I bought a surfboard! Well acually I still owe Buck some money but it was a great deal. Its a Matt Kechele board with some minor damage but hey its a good first board and since I'll be going to Peru with my rents in the fall and I always wanted to learm to surf, then why not now. 

I ride at station 42 in Geneva tomarrow.....SO EXCITED. I get to ride 24 hrs too so it should be fun. Mabey some dumbass redneck will light a field on fire and ill get to go out in the woods truck.

School starts next wednesday and I can actually say im excited to start even though i know itll get old fast atleast ill be one step closer to finacial stability.

Well im Outty, and remember never eat yellow snow! LATE!"

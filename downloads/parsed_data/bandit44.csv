"event","i dont hate anything more than people who think oh woe is me suck it up and make it better for yourself
i mean honestly if u need to make people feel bad for you and they dont already feel bad then shut up it cant be that bad i mean i kno a kid who has prob the worst life in millbury and he lives it to the fullest and never once do i here him complain i mean honestly wining because you have to do one thing or u got dumped or the person u like doesnt like you get over it i mean honestly most people in millbury dont have it that bad you are middleclass people you have a nice house and you have a good meal every meal
and the people who think they are fat or to small or to tall get over it there is really nothing you cna do unless you are fat then you can diet an exercise but in most cases you are jsut born that way so make due iwht wat u got

thanks to lauryn i have a point brought to my intention some people cant help it and im sorry if i affended you this is geared towards the people who just want attention so once again im sry but that was not dirrected towards you people wiht sicknesses"

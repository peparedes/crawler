"event","I am having a lot of days that feel like numerous days rolled into one, or it might just be one day.
I found a real life catch-22 and my mother didn't find it as interesting as i did so here it is...ok so minors are allowed to have cigarettes but they are not allowed to buy them and adults are not allowed to buy them for the minors yet minors still have cigarettes...hmm...so in order for the minors that do have cigarettes to get them an adult would have to buy them but that is agaisnt the law so...catch-22!! But hey this is america..whay would anyone want to follow the law?
Oh and for the people who like regular livjournal stuff...i woke up this morning brushed my teeth ryan and I got upset at eachother b/c I wasn't allowed to go to his hockey game and i bitched at him. He called back apologized, i apologized and we went to the mall. He went to practice/evaluation with Billy and his dad and now I am lonely and have the urge to set things on fire (my sister's hair)...so cynical was the best mood for me..
PS this was for Seth and Bobbie...we don't hang out as much as we need to! I heard Bobbie got a cellio phone! Yay! And this is also for other people who thought I dropped off the face of the Earth b/c of the obsession but into a website. You are making the founder very rich. I saw him and the guy from Ebay spending all our money! ha ha... I love you guys...most of you guys!
Have a great and safe summer.
And this summer Heather P and I were supposed t back pack around Europe with another friend..it fell through a few years back as does most of the other friends plans...good luck in your life (other friend)...oooh cryptic..BITE ME! 
I am off to find matches damnit!"

Tomorrow
tomorrow just another day
another way 
to spend my day
all by my self
starin at the tv screen
flipping through my magazine
everything is unclear
i need you hear do

and i wake up
put on my make up
pick up the phone
nobodys home
i need to break out
give me some take out
standing side the crowd
i wanna scream out loud 
i'll be ok
i'll be ok

walking down this whining road
raining days are all unknown
i have hit the ground 
staring up into the sky
countin all the reasons why
my mind is spinning around
i need to breath dooo

so,i wake up
put on my make up
pick up the phone
nobodys home
and i need to break out
give me some take out
standing side the crowd
i wanna scream out loud 
i'll be ok

get off from the floor 
i just can't take anymore
leave that all behind 
just get along

nah nah nah nah 
nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah oohhh

oh,i wake up
put on my make up
pick up the phone
nobodys home
and i need to break out
give me some take out
standing side the crowd
i wanna scream out loud 
i'll be ok
i'll be ok

oh,i wake up
put on my make up
pick up the phone
nobodys home
and i need to break out
give me some take out
standing side the crowd
i wanna scream out loud 

i need to break out!!
were ok were alright
were ok we'll be alright

tomorrow just another day
another way 
to spend my day
So when I have a bad day this is nice to know. Thanx Lillix!"

I feel very strongly about this song..,i dont know why. I just do. I feel like shit and do not want to be asked about my ensamble tomorrow. If you have to ask start praying for a better understanding of life and why people wither. I am withering so when you find out. Tell me."

This one states that after a star explodes in a supernove it will become a black hole and dissapear. Well...I wonder what the 2nd stage is after the explosion in a supernove. Wow what a helpful little book. Then more idiocity. We have like 75 mins to finish this 1 section. i was finished with it and sure of my answers before the stretch break which was 35 mins after we started. Wow. The smell of grease is overpowering. okay but anyhoo. I want some french fries now....Dern. Welp I will sit here making wedding dresses and rings b/c that is what came up on amazon.com and it is fun. I just finished the worlds cheapest looking ring that I am almost 100% positive taht someone will buy in the next month! weee...spinning chairs are fun!"

"event","So boredome in the library again! weee....I got yelled at in class by the sub for having my glorious Marilyn cards out. (TY Daddy for getting them) I did the play last night and had a decent time. I got to handle a shit load of money. I only think 1 person got in without paying. Stupid hoe in the red buttong up top from probably TJ Max! I will get her later. Oh well..I took my cards with me to the library so that sub doesn't get a boner from the hottest firstest playmate ever! She doesn't have to be naked to be hotter than anyone. Take a lesson skanks who come to school wearing swim suit material for shorts that look like underwear! I am in a good mood. I have been all day. I am not sure that Terance is though. I have tried to get him to smile all morning and he hasn't..well I got him to a little. anyhoo that doesn't matter now. He is coming to the crapalicious play and it will be crapalicious again. I might just bring back the orange soda from last nights play. hmmm... *ponder* eh if I want one I will just go after my shifty thing and get one before intermission and be back when it is Act 2. Nice! you know Marilyn Monroe weighed over 160 lbs... and she was still fine as hell!
   this gets me thinking about significant/ famous characters that have meant something to me. Like Dale Earnheart. those bastards wanted to put his autopsy on the net! They will burn in hell. His family must have died on the inside just looking at it. Their dad/ husband pretty much blown up on the inside form the impact. Augh! and people had the guts/nerve to try and post it on their sites. sick fucks! He was always smiling. You find me one damn pic where he isn't and well...dern on you! but he was always a happy guy and if some of his fans, i mean die hard fans had seen that...They would have dies on the inside too.
   Then Marilyn...Poor girl. I don't know if Norma Jean was fed up or Marilyn was. she was great. One of the greatest. So was James Dean. I want that pic of James Dean sitting on the floor while Marilyn lays on the bed. It is great. I want to paint my room in a hollywood theme.. yay.

   I know what Heather was tempted to do for me was really truely sweet. But that is between us.
   Right now I am just trying to stay out of everyone's way. I am just trying to focus on what is really important..No it isn't friendship. That is just the icing on the cake.. I eat plain cake...I am studying my ass off b/c when I had friends they got in my way. I will be in NHS I will do what I want in life and I cannot let teenage drama get in my way. So maybe this is the only apology any of you will see. I am sorry for your emotions, I am sorry you feel pain, I am sorry I won't apologize for the things I said. But too bad! Deal...
   I am sorry people think I am just a attention grabber..hmm that is why I left my school for so long... But that is between me and my doctor. 
   I can't say where my state of mind is at. I feel I dunno...kinda better...hmm....

The Reason
I'm not a perfect person
as many things I wish I didn't do
but I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
and so I have to say before I go
that I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
to change who I used to be
a reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
it's something I must live with everyday
and all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
and be the one who catches all your tears
that's why I need you to hear

I've found a resaon for me
to change who I used to be
a reason to start over new
and the reason is you
and the reason is you
and the reason is you

I've found a reason to show
a side of me you didn't know
a reason for all that I do
and the reason is you 
                                -Hoobastank
I love you and all the fights we have just know taht I think you make me a better person and I am sorry for the pain you feel. I have cried for an hour now for these falsehoods now I am in the market for blood and repention.
Terance I love you..know that...Forever and ever amen."

"event","okay my rabbit scratched the shit so I wrote this poem.....
Servitude

My flesh burns
I sit in my corner licking my wounds
I cry alone in the dark
In the depths of my fears
I hack up the blood of my being
As I choke on the smoke of your hatred
One day I will win
I will be the triumphant
But that day is not today
My day is long awaiting
I still linger in the darkness 
Waiting for your approval
					-Julie Dawson
It is cheesy and written about a rabbit scratching me. I wrote it after I stopped crying of course. Well tell me please.. I went through actual pain to write this and tomorrow I will look like a suicidal psychopath. But hey it is all gravy baby."

"event","You know I am cofused about a lot of things a lot of the time. I know one canstant..a few and that is he people I care deeply about. On this playing field I am the bad ass. I take that stand when they can't. I most of the time just cannot do this for myself. Say if a dog bit you 5 times in a row..do you trust him to not bite that 6th time?? I am. I am not saying that this person is a dog I care a lot about this person. I am just...unsure. (hints the title). 
     It is amazing how many druggie friends I can have without ever taking a hit of ANYTHING. I tend to care too much about getting them out and I ahave seen way too muchoness to get into that crap. I have watched people die. I had to comfort my friend who had to go to NY to get her trial reveiwed b/c her best friend died while high. So that shit freaks me out a whole damn lot. If you have to sit and watch your friend scream and a dead body to try to get them to wake up...I would like to think that has some impact on people. Some it won't affect at all. I am sorry. But maybe now this aforementioned person can see where I come from. 
    Hey on a softer, less intense note..I took my writing FCAT today....whoop-di-doo! I had the topic ""What job wouldn't you like?"" I had to explain my reasons for not wantning it. I chose ""Cubicle Worker"" yay!! I said things like I want to be acknowledged by my name not what job I have orwhich coffee cup is mine. I also stated that I would hate my fat boss to sneek into the office refridgorator and steal my twinkies and pudding cups just b/c his wife was too cheap to pack him anything good...unlike my mommacita who packed me a beautiful twinkie and pudding cup and...can't remeber. But yeah!
     Oooo... I am reading this wicked good book right now. It is called ""Gingerbread"". That is the name of this 16 yearold girl's doll that her daddy gave her. She is a sexaholic like myself and found her soulmate...like myself it is just that her soulmate broke up with her over another chick. I talk to mine about when we get old and wrinkly and that nice cute new couple moves in next door to our beachfront house we will make them an apple pie and say sorry up front. When they question our apology we will justsmile at eachother like old people do. REally in the back of our heads we grin a big ass grin knowing we might be the ones waking them up with our screams of pain and pleasure.... I am  a kinky freak okay!!!! get used to it. Btu in the book she gets to go to NY after her ""Blank"" dumps her b/c she was chrushing on his older hotter surfer babe brother.  She hangs with this old lady who reads the tarot (like I do) and loves Sugar (hints her name being Sugar Pie). Everyone has their own love troubles in this book and Cyd Charisse's only began.. Bum bum bum.. 
     Hey I could write reviews on books. It is just that I don't want to read the crappy books..I am only in for the long haul with good books..
   I have a complaint...Some people have whined about being the third wheel. STOP WHINING!!! these same people shamelessly neglect and make others feel like the odd one out or the last picked on a dodgeball team. Well....poo on you!!! This Anonomys person was all sappy and like ""I hate it when people leave me out purposefully"" well Sweetheart I hate to tell you .. you do it too. Telling other peole how cute they are all the time and gawking over them to get them to like you is a load of crap! Then I am not cute, am not worthy to have my picture taken with you, and definitely not worthy of the air you breathe!!!!! I am the third wheel in this case. It is all your fault.
     Okay to the ummm druggies ^ No breaking of the legs I promise not matter what happens. I will just keep to myself about it all. Shhhhh."

And if anyone takes him away from me...I don't even want to think about it... just think along the lines of a pit bull gone rabid. I don't care what it takes they will feel what I feel and I will most definitely fight to keep him. I love Terance and no one can argue with that. Not now not ever. One day we will be like Molly and Dustin and just chill all the time until we don't have to say anythingwe just kinda...know! lataz guys it is my bedtime plus i got to take care of my 3 bunnies and my goat...!!! yay

"event","Hey I was reading a cheesy email my mom sent but about the middle of it all I was like ""wow! this is so true""...""So...while we have it... it's best we love it.... and care for
it.....and fix it when it's broken.....and heal it when it's sick. This
is true..... for marriage..... and old cars..... and children with bad
report cards..... and dogs with bad hips..... and aging parents.....and
grandparents. We keep them because they are worth it, because we are
worth it. Some things we keep. Like a best friend that moved away
--or--a classmate we grew up with. There are just some things that make
life important, like people we know who are special.....and so, we keep
them close!""
  I was thinking about Terance and maybe I should treat him better because I wanna be there and stay with him...when he is broken and sick and old . I want to take care of him through all of this and I just want to take care of him for always and always!"

"event","So today I thought about it and had a good long talk about it and I have decided while I loathe what Jon and Ryan did I cannot hate them as people. Jon my apologies for calling you a jack-ass. Ryan my apologies for not wanting your happiness. I understand that all humans want to be happy and that was all you were looking for. Heather does not attend Newsome nor shall she ever attend Newsome. She will move and you would be that guy that got left because we all know that long distance relationships don't work.
  Heather this does not mean I do not support you in your sorrows right now. I am honest to goodness telling you there is someone better out there for you. He might even be a snowboarder. I know you have committment issues..in a sense we all do. Guys running out without telling us why scares us. It terrifies me. A lot of things about guys do, you and I just jumped into this hole not knowing what is there but you found the bottom of that hole. It isn't very pretty, I know. But guess what...There is more than just one hole to jump into and maybe next time you will have someone who will hold you and you can jump together. I know one day he will be perfect for you and you and him will be the envy of the party.
  Ryan you and Alexis will have to grow on me. I know many people will never really forgive you, but for now I hope you accept the fact that I will try to not hate. I don't hate. Oh goodness, I could never hate you. You are my teddy bear. I only want to see you happy even though it hurts my best friend. You are also very close to me so yesturday it tore me up to hear you didn't care that I was upset with you It felt like I lost a part of me. Accept or don't accept my apology at least I know I apologized.
  Terance, yesturday you complained about not being in my journal at first when I said I would fight for those people. I hate seeing or hearing you sad. I want to die knowing you are sad and you won't let me help. I broke a promise to you too last night. I almost didn't want to tell you. I am sure by the time you read this I might have told/shown you what I am going on about. I was stupid and caught up in my emotions. I couldn't cry I couldn't be happy all i knew then was raw emotion that I didn't know what to do with. I love you to death and you said the only way you would ever be mad at me is if I did something stupid...well I did. Please I need you to forgive me. I would be worse off without you. The thought of you has stopped so many bad things in my life and now I need you. All of you. I need your love, I need your sole to complete mine, i need your body to hold me close. Without you I would not have our Felix or our house. I will even have your babies...you don't have to have mine. I love you so fucking much it almost scares even me.
  Faith, augh you know I would fight for you too. If you meet me ever in the street and something comes up I will be there. Tomorrow I might get in trouble for sticking up for one of my friends.
  Ashley...I know she doesn't have a LJ but still this part is for her. Tomorrow I am going to meet you outside of 4th. Something happened today that has to be set straight. She is a vegetarian. I love her to death... I love everyone to death but back to the story. Today they made pizza in food prep. Her group is all freshman and to top it off they are all freshman boys! They decide to make a meat lover's pizza. Great job jerks! Well as manager she looked in the oven to make sure everything was going smoothly when a boy from her group comes up and says, "" get off your knees bitch."" I was appauled. Tomorrow I plan on making this young man apologize for A.) disrespecting his elders and B.) being a snot nosed kid!.
  So to the masses of today and tomorrow...I got new shoes. No sandals for Julie. ha ha. This is like a revelation! Paty for me! whopp-whoop! Oh crap I am in the library at school and the 3rd lunch bell is about to ring...

"event","So the papers today tell a grim story...loss of friendship loss of love. I hate to be behind most of it but I will admit to it. I have enevr cried for another person but today I did. I cried for my bestest friend in the whole widest world. Well if you are reading this you know all the culprits so I am going to use names. It started with a prank....So Ryan and Heather found eachother again *yayness* I was thanked many a time for their introduction. I was one of the happiest people on Earth all b/c my best friend was happy. But she knew she had commitment issues...so they decided to ""date"" until they knew it would work out. In his LJ she was hailed as the best person in the world.
  The other day was the first downhill day. We found out Alexis had an infatuation with many people from the group. She narrowed it down to Ryan..Well Nicole and Ryan thought it would be funny to kinda screw with her..so...Nicole called Alexis on 3 way while Ryan didn't say a word. After Nicole said she got off the phone with the man of the hour...Ryan. The whole ""no way.."", ""...yes way"" thing went down..Then Ryan pipes up with ""Uh...Yeah she did!"" Silence...Total embarrassment...leave on main male character.
  I thought this all to be cute and well..So Friday I saw him and her standing together waiting for the ride to subway. Eh..not ok so far anymore. What I don't know is that Jon was pushing this relationship counter to my pushing Heather's. Great job jack-ass! Well Ryan and Heather talked for a good long while yesturday. Ryan and Alexis sucked face for a good long while too. Heather has never heard a thing about Alexis until I said something today. I hate having to tell her but Ryan has a problem with telling people that need to know things the things they need to know. Ryan mentioned nothing to Heather at all. I don't know what the hell he was doing..seeing if he could play both..uh I think not! They are hardly in different area codes this time buddy! I never would have know but he had to rub it in by cutting in front of Terance and I befotre 1st prd. holding hands with Alexis.
  I was heartbroken for my friend all day. I got confirmation today in 4th prd. I was livid. I did not want to see him less talk to him. I went to Mrs. Baker's class after I was done in the library. I was told tht neither my opinion or the fact that I was upset was taken into their ( Jon and Ryan's) consideration. That shows a whole hell of a lot about our friendship doesn't it.
  I got to 5th prd and wrote this in the first couple of minutes....

Bleed For Me

Silent snickers
Sideways glances
Love forever
Changed in the moving

Take this heart
It was leant to me
I'll bleed for her
You better bleed for me

Through me she'll die
Your folly kills us
Murder for the other

Tears I cry for her
Tears I cry for me
Loss of a lover
Loss of a friend

Hatred for the other

-Julie Idana Dawson

That was my poem to the culprits. Heather I love you and if anyone hurts you ...you know I am the next Xena when that happens. I can hardly stand up for myself but if anyone touches you or Molly or Kyra or Tiffany, I will kill to make y'all happy. Oh and Terance I would kill if anyone touched you.
  Oh *change of subject* yay for molly I drove behind her b/f and her taking her to the orthodontist for her braces getting removed...I better see you smiling tomorrow!
  Ryan Jon I am sorry you didn't value me as a friend/ person at all.
  Tomorrow is a new day and to Heather may Colorado be a new beginning away from jerks here. I will visit I swear!
  Have a Day!!

No matter what comes up...If I want to run away or just get away from something I don't have that option any more. My mother say I will never move again until it is my choice. Well, it is difficult to run from gossip when you are standing still. Someone told these girls I wanted to ""cut"" them. Yes I did/ do I am not sure anymore. Everyone goes through bad times...when they happen and you finally get over it..you want to be over it and not really ever think about it...ok new point but i swear they all tie together at the end..I think it is stupid to smoke pot....i will finish it later but yeah it has to do with death and my family and i want to die i hate my mom"

"event","I am kinda tired right now so if there is something on here that makes no sense just think about in the mindset of a tired person...it will all be good. okay I suppose I will talk about last night because it was a rollercoaster of people and emotions.
  Okay...I will start at the beginning of the night. I left my sis alone, I hate doing that...she is only 11. So I run down my driveway b/c Heather had just called and I hate making her mom mad at me b/c I am horrible with being punctual. So me and my out-of-shape self are panting until we get out of the car. I am happy so far.
  We see Ryan, Chris, and Phil. Okay still happy. Then about the same time we got out of the car Amber Gortman and Madi get out of their's.. Augh I hate Amber with a passion. So I am happy but still want to go on a murder rampage. Right...finally we don't have to hear her god aweful voice, they left. So we stand around talking for a bit and then we head over to the dollar tree for Ryan to have his 8th soda stored in his freakishly tall body. (Hyperness coming on soon) right then...they are there so I make Heather stay with me looking at the cheapo kids stuff. Right, time to go back to the theater...Heather and I got hungry.
  We go back and the abomination follows. Okay we have to look at the facts.. I love Madi and Phil to death but they were with the skankiness...so...on with the story. WE go in to buy a pizza and see Brian Spears ""Balls"" so we have him hang with us for a while. All the while I am sandwhiched between 2 guys I think like me and I am just waiting for Terance. I kept looking at the bench where he said he would be... Okay...sitting outside still...Now the 4 of us are sitting outside just wating for the pizza and hey wow! Justin/Paco comes up. WE talk and then his date asks questions about Kyle.. It is over..""how did you put up with him?"" I dunno I just did! "" He wasn't faithful"" I know that  I was told everyday by random people. Great!!!
  Finally go inside and eat. We found Terance so our seating arrangement changes...Terance, me, then Chris. Sandwhich. Heather was the same way with Ryan and Brian. But then everyone got into a footsie war. Then  we ditch and leave Brian with 2 slices left. lol!
  We saw Along Came Polly but I didn't know that until the title came up. I want to see Starsky and Hutch...okay the movie was great it was hilarious. I was a ferret and Chris and Terance want a blind ferret..Augh boys!!! okay I am better so far..Danced to the crribbean music in the credits.
  We went back outside after frolicing in the theater and jumped on planters so I was tall again. I bounced the bouncy ball some and saw way too many people I know so it was cool.
  Okay Heather left and then Ryan took Chris and Phil so Terance and I left the plater spot thingy. Right I was getting cold and nervous. I was so happy to have a lone time with him but I needed to be home. We couldn't find his mom so at about 10:00 ,when I was supposed to be home, I left the movies. Heather lost something else..Sorry Heather. And I was just being heartbroken in the backseat of Terance's van. While loking for his mom he said that he wanted to die... People have told me I am the reason they want to die so this was different but obviously my mind made it the same way.It hurt a lot. I wanted to cry. Then he tried saying sorry but by then I was in that state of mind where I get to thinking about everything anyone has ever said to me. plus Justin's date from earlier wasn't helping my thoughts. So Terance's step-dad asked if I was sick and I just said I was tired, which wasn't completely a lie. His mom was about to call mine which would have been worse than me coming home late b/c Terance wasn't supposed to be there in the first place. Confusion. Hate. Love. All at the same time!
I love Terance but I didn't know what to do last night when he said that so I was kinda just going through all the right motions but my heart couldn't be in it. Not then anyways. I know he didn't mean it the way it sounded but it hurt real bad.
  Okay enough about last night..what to complain about now?...hmmm..... How about my Driver's Ed. class...It isn't so bad but I hate being kinda...well just there. My group is ok.. Allison is the only person I really kinda know. I feel kinda out of place there. Everyone is having a good time and I don't know what is going on. So I stay to myself and do whatever they want. Jaclyn is popular without knowing it. Nikola just kinda sits in the back..I should be back there so at least Jaclyn could talk to someone. 
  This is the longest entry i have had without putting a poem or song in it. Cool. I guess.?! But yeah I just rambled about last night. I really have nothing to say. I just didn't want to write all that in my diary. My hand would hurt.
  I am going to go back to sleep and see if I wake up in a different mood.

But if I knew that poeple would be after me and ask me funny questions so I stay here in my pit of blah confusion. I am not really confused but I just am well....not. That is the only way to put it. I watched ginGer Snaps today...goood movie but it pointed out some things. I am a girl and I have very different needs though. I am not like most girls you find in high school. Most are those pretty ones. I am not saying I am unfortunate. I find myself very attractive some days. I don't shop at Ambercrombie or Hollister anmd to a lot of guys that makes me un-pretty. I know that at least one guy likes me.I hope he likes me for a long time. I am sorry to thiose unfortunate people who decide to read this. I don't want you in the mood that I am in. I am just venting so no one else has to feel this nothingness I feel right now....You know sometimes ( I know he doesn't know this yet) I want to crawl into Terance's lap and cry. For no good reason. And I know he doesn't like me crying but I hope he turns out the way I think he would. I think or hope he would talk real gentle like and whisper in my ear that everything is ok and he would just hold me and play with the tips of my hair and he held me tight with his other arm. I want to just cry into his shirt and just be there. I could die there. I love him so much. Sometimes I forget who I am and I actually think we will be together for a long time. But I am Julie the queen of destroying things. I ruin perfectly good things. I want him to want me for a long time to come...later guys
I love you Terance...please know that
Forever and ever....
Oh yeah I have had this song stuck in my head all day...""This Could be Love"" by Alkaline Trio

I've got a book of mathes
I've got a can of kerosene
I've got some bright ideas involving you and me
i don't blame you for walking away
i'd do the same if i saw me
i shat the bed and laid there in it
thinking of you wide awake for days

and i found you tounge tied
in my twisted little brain
you couldn't crack a smile
i didn't catch your name
i don't blame you for walking away
i'd do the same if i saw me
i swear it's not contagious
in four short steps we can erase this

step one: slit my throat
step two: play in my blood
step three: cover me in dirty sheets and run laughing out of the house
step four: stop off at edgebrook creek and rinse those crimson hands
you took me hostage and made your demands
i couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers
one by one"

""Know Me""
Love at first sight, hardly
Love on a deeper level, intimately
Before our walk along the beach
Hush darling, there is something more...
I want you to know me,
Tattered and torn,
Broken and bruised,
Used and wasted.
I want you to know me,
Inside and out,
Dressed and undressed.
Wait still, I'm not quite done...
I want you to know me,
When I am happy and sad,
Angry and defeated,
Strong and weak.
I want you to know me,
Just me              -Julie
...That was for my love, Terance.
this next one is well I am not quite sure where it came from.....
""Murderous Love""
AS we sit here
You are dying
You say it is my fault
Then I pull you close
Press my lips to yours
Cold and dying
I whisper in your ear,
""Die again sweet lover,""
And you are gone

Days go by
I smell you in my clothes
I feel your lips on mine
I hear your whisper in my ear

You won't die
But your dead
Stop haunting me
Stop this torture

I want you back
Your arms around me
Your warmth engulfing me

I cannot have you I know 
So let's make a deal here and now
Dead to undead
Stop visiting my grave.

   Okay I know a lot of you won't understand that last one...So let me try and explain..In the beginning a murder happens and you are led to beleive the girl kills her boyfriend or lover. Later the victim's spirit haunts the murderer. But by the end the girl is the one who died and is haunted by the presence of her murderous boyfriend visiting her grave day after day.Okay that is what was going through my head when I wrote it.
   So yeah today is Sunday and we have one day of freedom left. I really don't mind too much. I get to see everyone. It feels like we have been gone for summer break and are just now getting back. Heh...shows you how smart I am.
   I am excited though... I had no clue that Allison had a LJ but she does and she has a wicked awesome picture of her for her icon or main picture. She is in my homeroom. So yeah I am a loser.
Catch ya lata kiddies...

"event","I am mad at my mom and I envy Terance for his bravery. I hate my Mom for thinking no other way than... "" ...my daughter is a slut and cannot change."" That is all i am, ever since I was almost pregnant. I can change II have a boyfriend who is one of the most beautiful people I know.. I don't care if he is cute or not, I don't care if he is rich or not, I don't care how he dresses,I don't care if he fucking dances like a reject. He loves me and would never hurt me. I have had abusive boyfriends. Some so bad that I have been scared of letting myself love anyone. I am scared of losing again. I hate the empty feeling of being alone. Today I don't know what...maybe I was the only one scared.. But Terance wouldn't touch me and that was the one thing to settle me and I couldn't have it. I went inside and for the first time in a while now I cried. I love him so much and I can hardly see myself without him. I know a while back I promised myself to be independent...but if that means I cannot have Terance then goddammit I will depend on him. And we will take my truck and run away to Cali where we will have a big box, with lots of windows, and everyone I love will be there, Heather and Ryan will live next door in another very big house, and Kyra and her boyfriend on the other side of Heather with Jon's corpse in the car. Terance and I will have a black and white great dane and we will have nice parties and we will never know hate ...only love. See, the whole point is to run away from the hate I have here and only be with the people we love therefore I am always happy. But I have a feeling this cannot be. I have to have the pain I will carry around. I have to have pain to feel the love from these people. Sometimes I wish I were stronger.. I cry too much. It is late I have to go. Maybe now I am sick/tired enough to go to bed. Maybe the praying thing might work tonight. If I pray today didn't really happen then maybe I will wake up on my beach tomorrow. I will get my beach...even if I don't see it till I die... I will get it."

   But Terance is still in Jacksonville. :( He will be back on Sunday so it will all be better. His family likes me..his mom gave him money for a phone card but his brother lets him use his cell b/c after nine he gets free minutes. His brother left his phone with him..yay! His Dad is a tid-bit nutty. lol i talked to him last night for a little while and well...it was unique. Yeah unique is a good word. 
   I am so excited.. tomorrow is Christmas and I know I am getting Brand New's CD ""Deja Entendu"" and Alkaline Trio's Cd. Yay. I will have a day full of music listening. 
   I am not sure but I think tonight my uncle might take me shopping like last year. That was fun I like hanging out with him. No, not b/c he will buy me an entire store if I asked for it. But b/c I don't see him much. He lives in Antartica! I couldn't live there, I would worry about having a tanning bed too much. lol. But hey that is me.
   I have to go make cookies and get too much dough stuck to my fingers by accident...yeah accident..lol accident my ass! Then I suppose i will just lick it all off..

I am always happy when he is around. He makes me smile just by standing there. He wrote me a note and it was kinda my Christmas present because neither one of us had enough time or money to go shopping yet. I wrote him a poem. If you want to go see it go for it. It is posted on www.poetry.com then you type in my name. And it is called ""Where I Belong"". Righto. I might think of something else to say laters but for right now...nope. Sry Fans. :("

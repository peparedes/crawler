"event","Yes that's right i'am back in ireland. Just to recap, i spent a month in the philippines... I went to the beach, shopped like crazy, got to hang out with my cousins and made some friends. It was bliss except for the fact that traffic was hell. Anyway i had fun and wished i had stayed longer. Then after that we spent 2 days in singapore and met up with my aunt from malaysia. Singapore was awesome the weather was great and the place is so clean and organized. I didn't have to worry about drinking the water. while in singapore we went shopping (of course) and went on the night safari, it was pretty cool. I would love to visit singapore again and stay longer than two days. HA! can you believe it i came back with a tan! it's pretty funny. Anyway back to reality, I sent all of my friends post card from both places. I would have sent you all one from london but it was too damn expensive. Well that's all for now.  HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL AND A VERY LATE MERRY CHRISTMAS."

"event","Okay so this is the hickest town I've been in except for the town I've lived in. Okay, I've been spending most of my time with my slammin' cousin Victoria (who by the way is hella gorgeous ;-) ) and she took me on a tour of Ferndale today. I drove. We went to Sandy Point, (which is a local hang out and party spot during the summertime) but nobody was out because it was an ugly day. So we drove downtown for no freakin' reason and I got stuck in some rush hour traffic. Yesterday we went and saw a movie. I was very dissapointed in the lack of ""hotties"" at their mall. Victoria was going crazy because she found two juniors from school that love her. Heehee. I'm so cute. Everyone was looking at me. We saw Old School yesterday, and Bringing Down the House on Friday. We also rented a couple lovely movies yesterday, My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Inventing the Abbotts. Joaquin is sooo hot. (Joe-quan). Oh baby. So I'm excited (in a way) to get to Ireland, but will I make friends? Maybe I should start a poll on who thinks I'm friendly or what. Anyways, Victoria's brothers' best friend is a cute guy who wants me, and he's stopping by tonight after work. He works at the movie theatre and said that he would get us in free sometime, but the college bum hasn't been working when we've been showing up. Ahh I'll get him this weekend, I'll get him, my pretties. Wellp...that pretty much summarizes my Fun in Ferndale, it's been loads of fun because I've been bonding with Mrs. Krauss and Victoria. Hope you all liked reading about ME AND ONLY ME.

Love,
Your Precious"

So we decided to go back to dawson because we knew that graham would be there visiting. Anyway we got to dc and we called graham but he refused to visit us. It was very disappointing, i mean we came back just to see him! how very disappointing. So Anyway we went back to chetwynd and chilled at home and spend quality time with the parentals. Oh and good news, i will be going with my mom for sure to ireland and also i was sort listed for that canada world youth challenge. But it doesn't start until february so i said forget that, i'm not gonna wait another month just to see if i pass the preliminaries or not. So only a few more weeks until my last days at the dorms, with friends, and canada. In a way i'm sadden because i will miss friends, family and all of the memories i've had in the 10 years i've spent in this country. Till tomorrow. P.S.

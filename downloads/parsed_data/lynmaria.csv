<P>But I'll start with yesterday. It was Friday and I took Maureen's bus home and we hung around her house all night with Mike and Tim. There was <FONT color=#009900>poker and pool</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff6600>gorilla bites?</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>the classic truth or dare, which turned into truth</FONT>, <FONT color=#cc6600>seizure dancing</FONT>, <FONT color=#3366ff>'good games'</FONT>, and even greater pictures...it was a lot of fun. <U>A lot of fun</U>.&nbsp;And Mike even came out of the closet. (Literally, not figuratively)</P>
<P>Well this morning we got up around noon and hung out..and now me and Mo are at Staci's house. But she's going to work soon, so me and Mo will probably just go back to her&nbsp;house because it's kind of cold outside. </P>
<P>Edit: Alright so, we walked back to Maureen's in the freezing cold and just hung around with the bubby-loving babies till I left around 11. <3</P>"

"event","Alright well, school's going okay. We can't talk english
in la clase de espanol anymore and even though it's going to be hard, I
think it will be fun. I can't believe it's Wednesday already. Hm,
nothing really interesting happened today, except that <span style=""color: rgb(153, 102, 51);"">Kelsi fainted, Jimmy broke his nose, Britt was in tears, and my arm is severely bruised.</span>
Alright, so the first part of that sentence was sarcasm. It was a very
interesting day. Most of the junior class got their blood drawn for a
lipid profile. We all had to fast since 8 last night; so by the time we
got to school we were all starving. Kelsi, Melissa, and I were
scheduled to get our blood drawn at 8:30, and by the time we were
weighed and measured and our blood pressure was taken, it was about 9.
So finally the three of us were in line to get our blood taken; and I
was so scared. Kelsi was first, then Melissa, and finally me. Well,
when I got behind the curtains, Kelsi was lying on a mat and was as
white as a ghost, so I thought she had already passed out, but the
nurses figured it would be best for her to lie down, that way if she
did faint she wouldn't fall over in the chair. Just as the nurse is
done pulling the needle out of me, Kelsi hits the floor. I thought she
slammed her head into a table..but thankfully she only hit the ground.
Anyway, <span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 0);"">they had to snap one of those ammonia sticks to wake her up</span> and the hilarious part is...she didnt know she fainted. We all ate, well they ate,<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""> <span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0);"">I gorged myself with poptarts, cinnamin buns, and apple juice.</span></span> And the drama ended there, or so we thought...<br>
<br>
So before lunch, Meliss comes running up to me at my locker, and starts
rambling about Jimmy fainting after he got his blood taken and getting
rushed to the hospital and Britt crying, and I'm thinking that this is
one of Melissa and Jimmy's schemes to make me believe something they
totally made up. So I'm like, ""Yeah right. I don't believe you."" But,
then she started getting convincing, so I believed her. Andd turns out <span style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 204);"">Jimmy did faint and hit his face </span><font style=""text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(102, 102, 204);"" size=""3"">head on</font><span style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 204);"">, had a seizure and broke his nose!</span>
He was passed out for like 3 minutes! I felt so bad for him. Well I
called him after school and he's going to go to school tomorrow. <span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">Geez, if I broke my nose, I'd milk it for all it's worth.</span> I wouldn't come to school until my nose had made a full recovery and you could never tell it was broken."

"event","So, of course we lost the game on Friday. But atleast we had a good
time. Melissa came over right after school and we hung out until we
left for the game with Tiffani. We met up with Maureen and watched the
game, but it wasn't long until we were bored. We walked around and ran
into Rachel and then me and Rachel came across Ashley and Brandon, so
it was a cute little Costa's reunion. Hmm. Well after the game, Meliss
drove me home, but we think it would have been cooler if she had her
license.<br>
<br>
I went to Maureen's on Saturday. And we did a ton of walking. We
probably lost atleast 5 pounds. I got there, and we got bored right
away, so we went for a walk. We met up with some guys and walked to the
park with them. We really didn't want to be there with them, and thank
the Lord, that Tim called Maureen. We made up an excuse that we were
going to hang out with our other friends, so we finally got to leave.
We walked straight to Maureen's house to cover the stench of the
cigarette's that the guys were smoking...and then we went back down to
town, to find something to eat. It was really humid out so we figured
that icecream was a good solution. After that, we met up with Mike and
Tim at the Chinese place. And after <span style=""font-style: italic;"">that</span>
we all went to Tim's. But before me and Mo could get there, one of boys
we met on the way to the park spotted us. How annoying. Well we hung
out at Tim's for a little bit, but Maureen I got bored, so we went back
to her house, ate some food, and then went back down to Tim's. A little
while later, Mike and Tim were going to watch a soccer game so me and
Mo left for her house a final time. We hung out with Mary for a while
and then watched the babies for a little bit. And when Mike got home we
had a hilarious time, laughing at the pictures and<span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 0);""> </span>videos. I left around 10ish and went straight to bed. It was a long, exhausting day.<br>
<br>
And, all I've done today, is gone to Walmart, but I'm really tired. So
I think I'm just going to finish some homework and go to bed.<br>"

"event","So I think you all deserve a decent update. And since I had fun today,
I'll write about that.
Well, I woke up this morning, and was running late since I really did
not feel like getting up early. But when I got to school, everything
was alright. Spanish was review work; Wellness was so very boring; Chem
was long, and then she tried to get us to start a lab 10 minutes before
class was over; and english was boring and going over homework and the
rest of our introductions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Well after school was the fun part of my day. I went to Staci's
around 3:30 and we walked to Maureen's. You might need to be reminded,
that this is a<font style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"" size=""4""> long</font> hilly walk and it was <font size=""4""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0);"">veryy-very hot</span></font>.
We got there and hung out with the little kids and took lots and lots
of pichassss. &lt;333. Then we thought we'd walk to the library to get
some homework done, but you know how that goes...it's a struggle to
leave Mo's house, the kids beg us to stay... Well, we got there around
6:30 but the library closes at 5. Nice job. But I don't mind, none of
us were in the mood to do homework anyway. So on the way back to
Maureen's we stop at Joe and Lorenzo's and ate there. And took more
pictures. Haha. After a full mean, we walk back to Maureen's, and stay
and chat for a bit, and then me and Staci walk all the way back to her
house. And her mom took me home around 8. Andd, then my parent's
weren't too pleased, because I was supposed to be home at 6, so I can
eat dinner with them...but oh well.<br>
<br>
Well, Laguna is starting now...and I still want to put pictures up so, I'll give you a link soon.<br>"

ipod with me, because he's going to use it too. But I'm so happy I
finally got them. I've wanted a digital camera for so long and an iPod
since before I can remember.<br>
<br>
After coming home from Scranton, I went straight to the bowling alley
with Melissa. And we met up with Kelsi, Jimmy, and Staci. Andd took
lots of pictures &lt;3. Which I will put up soon; hopefully.<br>

"event","Yesterday was the first day of school and we're juniors this year, so
we got the ""junior year"" speech about how colleges look at this year
and it's the hardest academic year; and we better start looking at
colleges; and blah de blah. And Dr.Hudak also talked about the
construction and parking and ya know, the basic rules and first day
speech.<br>
<br>
Speaking of construction, the hallways are packed full of people, and
now that we cant use that lakeside hallway, its just too crowded. But
my schedule is pretty good and goes like this:<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Spanish IV</span>: I have Mrs.Petrillo, and I loved her in Spanish II, so thats good. And Melissa and Britt are with me &lt;3<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Grad Project on A days</span>: This class is really going to suck. I have basically no one to talk to and I really don't know what I'm going to do.<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Gym/Health on B days</span>: This is pretty much my grad proj class. I really don't know who I'll partner with. Ugh, I don't talk to anyone really.<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">A lunch</span>: This is a good lunch, I sit with my soulsister Britt. <br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Chemistry</span>: Maureen sits next to me <span style=""font-style: italic;"">and</span> she is my lab partner &lt;33<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">British Lit Honors</span>: I've got a good class there too, and Melissa's there. But I still haven't read my summer reading. Uh oh.<br>
<br>
So right after school yesterday, I went to Salina's to babysit, and
stayed there till about 10. So that sucked, and then I had to come home
and read some stuff for Chem.<br>
<br>
And tomorrow is the first friday, but I'm working so I haven't got any
other plans. And Salina will probably call me for Saturday, so there
pretty much goes my weekend...<br>

the Keane Family.</span></font> So I headed to Maureen's yesterday after work and we
hung out there with the family till about 8. Kelly and I were having an
in-depth conversation about Chuckie (that freaky doll from the movie)
and Charlie (from Hide and Seek) and she was telling me a story
of&nbsp; how one time Chuckie was in John and Matt's closet and she was
sitting on the bed and she heard a noise and she said to herself, <font style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 0);"" size=""5"">""holy
friggen crap, what the hell was that?!""</font><span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 0);""> </span>and I was hysterical laughing
because it's just too funny to hear these words coming out of a
six-year-old's mouth. And she's dead serious about it too, which can be
a little freaky sometimes. Later on Maureen's dad took Maureen, Mike,
Ed, Joe, Patrick, and me to the new Pizza Hut. It was really nice and
the food still tasted the same. And that's good, because I would have
died if they changed anything about the wings &lt;3333. After pizza and
wings, we went to the halfway house for icecream and headed home.<br>

<br>

So this morning, I was awoken by Kelly turning on the light and jumping
into bed and before I know it; all of the little ones (Kelly, Kimmy,
Matt, and John) have <font style=""font-weight: bold;"" size=""3""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 0);"">swarmed</span></font> into the room. So for an hour or so, we
just entertained them and watched Rachel too. Then around noon, we all
left for L.A. (as in Lake Adventure). We spent most of the day there
just hanging out in the club house and talking to everyone that
vacations there and such.<br>

<br>

And now I'm home; sulking because<font size=""4""> I reallyy have to read my summer
reading.</font> I got my schedule yesterday and I have english 4th block;
first semester. And all I've read is my choice book. Geez, why do I
wait till the last minute?! And speaking of waiting till the last
minute, I'm finishing shopping tomorrow before I have to babysit at 3.
Which means I have to get up early to be at the mall when they open.
Ugh."

Alright well, I worked 10-4 yesterday, and it was so slow. After work, Maureen called to see if I wanted to hangout. So around 9, Maureen, Staci, Mike, Tim, and I went bowling till they closed at 11. 

I worked at golf today and I love working outside, it's just a lot easier. The golf team stopped by, and since like half the golf team works at Costa's...I just kept handing out free baskets to most of the guys. But when they left, my manager told me to make sure I was only handing out free baskets to employees..which I was...pretty much.

Tomorrow, I have to get up early so I can go with Kaylene to freshman orientation cause she wants me to show her around. And then work at 10. And after work, probably hanging out with Staci and Maureen."

"event","Sunday was the MTV Video Music Awards so Britt, Melissa, Kaylene, Tim, Joe, and Staci came over. Anddddd Jimmy was invited, but aw, he had to ice his ankle, so he couldn't come. The VMA's were stupid this year, and Mariah Carey was a fat cow as usual. I heard she ripped out all the size 12 tags on her jeans and sewed in size 6's. HOW PATHETIC. Jennifer Lopez wasn't even at the VMA's so that sucked. But Kelly won 2 awards, and performed last...and they always save the best for last..even though she didnt perform as well as she usually does. But it was fun at the house. 

The girls stayed over and we went bed really late and then had to get up at 7; so we'd be at dorney when they opened. So everyone was really tired. When we got there the weather wasn't that bad, it's was kind of hazy and hot. I actually went on Talon and Hydra, my first ""loopies"". And the pictures were hilarious. We did some water rides and on one ride there was a lady with man feet. Ugh gross. By the time we had to go everyone was extremely exhausted, and everyone fell asleep on the way home. Overall the day was really fun.

Today, my boss called at 9:30 to tell me that Costa's wouldn't be opening today. So I'll probably just hang around the house and procrastinate against my summer reading. (Is that even how you use that word, I don't think so, it sounds really weird.)"

"event","I worked 3 hours on Friday, and finally found out why there are such
things as a 3 hour shift...it's to cover people who are on breaks. So I
worked outside at baseball and then golf. I like working golf a lot
better, because I dont know how to work baseball... I just give out
change. And at golf, it's less lonely..<br>
<br>
After work, I went straight to Staci's. We watched a movie, and ate super spicy wings...they were <span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;"">burning my mouth</span> and <span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;"">bringing tears to my eyes</span>
and I look over at Staci and she's practically swallowing them without
a care in the world. Now, Staci has tears in her eyes because she's
laughing so hard as I jug down about a gallon of water.<br>
<br>
We woke up early the next morning, so Maureen could pick us up, and
then we went to the mall. Have I mentioned how much I love her little
brothers and sisters? They're just too fricken adorable. Maureen,
Staci, and I shopped from the mall opened, until 3. You would think
that would be enough time, but we're still not done. After that, I hung
out Maureen's and then she came over here...we ate and hung out, took
pictures by the black light (<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">&lt;3</span>) and watched <span style=""font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 204, 255);"">The Notebook</span>. Took her home, since she had work in the morning.<br>
<br>
Today I slept late, which I haven't done in oh-so-very long and I've
just been lounging around the house ever since. I go to work at 5 and
leave at 9. So that's gonna suck. And tomorrow, I have off. I work 2
days this week, so I'm hoping I can go to the mall again or something.
Next Sunday are the VMA's so I made sure I wasn't working that night,
because Staci, Melissa, and Kaylene are coming over to watch and
sleepover and the following day we're all going to Dorney Park And
after that, it's like 10 days left of summer. TEN. That's all, and I
haven't even started Wuthering Heights and Pride and Prejudice. But I
have spanish first with Britt and Melissa, so I'm looking forward to
that.<br>"

"event","Babysitting last night was <font style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 102); font-weight: bold;"" size=""4"">AWFUL</font>!
Ugh, horrendous. I watched all four of the kids, ages: 2 months, 2
years, 3 years, and 6 years old. The girls, (the 2 and 3 year old) are
supposed to be in bed by 7, 7:30. I got there at 7 and they were still
awake, the baby was crying so I couldn't get the girls to bed at the
same time. Finally I get the baby to be quiet. But the girls wouldn't
go to bed. And it wasn't until 10:30 that everyone went to sleep. Then
I didnt get home till about 2:30, and didnt fall asleep till 3:30.<br>
<br>
I woke up at 10 today, and couldnt fall back to sleep; I layed out in
the sun, but it was just too hot. Came inside, showered, and hung out
till I had to go work at 4. Work was unbelievably hot. We have air
conditioning but it was busy, so with the doors constintly opening, it
wasn't really cool inside. Then it got really dark, and windy, and it
was lightning and thundering and<span style=""font-style: italic;""> baboom</span>,
the power went out for like 5 seconds.. It started pouring and
everything outside closed. We were really slow...so I just hung outside
for awhile, getting paid to do nothing.<br>
<br>
I work tomorrow, 6-9, but really what's the point of going in, just so I can work for 3 lousy hours...<br>"

Just as good as the cd. I wishh I could go back again. Ughh; I can't

screaming. I didn't hear Jimmy scream or even sing. But it seemed
like he had a good time. Haha. When it got quiet I would just scream
again. ""AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! GO KELLYY! WHOOOOOOO!!!!!!!"" My stomach aches
from screaming so hard.&nbsp; Ohhh, lord, it was tooo much fun. The
Graham Colton band opened for her and they were really good too. We
couldn't understand much of the words, but they were pretty good.&nbsp;
After the show, I bought a poster of Kelly. And the Graham Colton band
was there to sign autographs and such, soo they signed the back of my
poster. After all that we slept at Melissa's and that was really fun
too. We played taboo and it was hilarious.<br>

Then we went on the go-carts..for free. I had the faster cart but I let
Staci get ahead for a little..just to be nice. Staci didn't know where
her brakes were..so when we had to stop she nearly ran over Brandon and
stopped in the middle of the track. Hilarious. Inside for some
ice-cream andd back out to the go-carts..for free. This time I had <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 153, 102);"">thee</span>
crappy-est one there. Wayyy slow and I thought the tires were like
gonna come off. Staci almost lapped me, but with my swerving she wasn't
able to..We left a while later and went for a quick ride on her boat.

a good meal..she nearly gave me a heart attack..and I refused to put my

<P><BR>So we left for FL Thursday night at 1 am. So I guess that's really Friday morning.We drove down. Andd don't ask why we left that late/early 'cause welll...long story. Anywayy, it was an extremely long ride.</P>
<P><BR>Let's go over the highlights of this trip so far::: We finally got to FL, Saturday, and it took us <FONT color=#00cccc><FONT size=5>3 hours</FONT> </FONT>to find a hotel that wasn't booked up. Yeah, why didn't my parents just make reservations?! No idea. Anyway, this hotel is nice and I like it and best of allll...I'm on the computer.</P>
<P>Thennn last night..guess where I went. Just guess. Hooters! Yeahh, and I thought you had to be pretty, and skinny and have big boobs and all that, but some of the waitresses there..weren't. Anyway, I gotta shirt. haha</P>

<br>
After laying out for a couple hours; I took a shower, and then me and
my mom picked up Staci and we set out for a grand adventure at Walmart.
I bought a few things for Florida, and she bought the first season of
Laguna Beach, and <span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">seat covers for her car</span> &lt;33. Well, I was gonna buy Laguna Beach, but then decided against it, maybe when I get back from vacay.. pero yo no se.<br>
<br>
Well, I leave for Florida tonight <font size=""5""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">in our car;</span></font> so we'll be driving for like <span style=""color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"">an entire day</span>.
And, it's not so much as a vacation even. The whole reason we're going
down is so my parents can look at a motorhome..yeahh. Theres this big
rv dealer down there, so that's the main reason. Of course, we'll visit
a beach one day. And maybe a park or two but we did <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">the Disney/Sea World scene</span> last year. I really wanna hit Dorney on the way back, because I haven't been there in like 2 years.<br>

was extremely busy at Costa's.&nbsp; I don't mind when we're a little
busy, but on holidays...it gets out of control. After work, I went to
my cousins' in ny and saw fireworks there, which weren't spectacular.<br>
<br>
Yesterday Staci came over. We bought our own fireworks, and those
entertained us for a while. Maureen called with good news. And then
Staci and I went to Cinemark to see <font size=""6""><span style=""color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"">War of the Worlds</span></font>. It was such an awesome movie, but it was <span style=""font-style: italic;"">really scary</span>.
I mean if that ever happened, I would be the first one to die, because
I would first like faint of fear, then they would come and vaporize me.
And if I didn't faint, I would be too scared to move, and then they'd
come and vaporize me. And anyway, as you've probably seen in the
previews there's like this lightning storm in the beginning of the
movie. Anyway, when we left the movies, we were in a lightning storm,
so that was kind of freaky.<br>
<br>
Soo I work today, and my cousins are coming up tomorrow and staying till sunday...<br>
And I really wish it was sunny, so I could my morning off to tan.<br>"

"event","It's so early in the morning but I can't sleep; so:
 
<br>
<br>
Yesterday, morning I went to Staci's and we watched Billy Madison. Funny. Then we walked down (<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">in the sweltering heat</span>)
to Joe and Lorenzo's and ate some cheese fries and warm soda. Called
Maureen and walked to her house. I love it there. Then we walked back
to Staci's house (again in the heat; and<font style=""font-weight: bold;"" size=""3""> </font><font style=""font-weight: bold;"" size=""3"">the walk from Mo's to Staci's is <span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 0);"">not close</span></font>.)&nbsp; Danielle (Staci's sister) and Staci were ahead and they locked us out of the house (Me: <font size=""4"">""OH MY GOD! LET US INTO THIS HOUSE; BEFORE WE HAVE A HEATSTROKE!!!""</font>)
so we had to run around to the kitchen before they had a chance to lock
that door too. Then it was a mad dash to stand in front of the air
conditioner. Funny stuff. Then we watched Never Been Kissed.&nbsp;
After that me and Maureen told Staci we'd meet her later, and we walked back
to Maureen's. And let me tell you,<span style=""color: rgb(255, 204, 0);""> <span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 0);"">the cutest, funniest kids live there.</span></span>&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(255, 204, 0);""></span> So we walk into the house, and Maureen's older sister (Mary) is yelling at Maureen's 6 year old sister (Kelly): <span style=""color: rgb(255, 204, 0);""></span><br>
Mary: ""KELLY, IF YOU EVER FRICKEN DO THAT AGAIN, I'LL FRICKEN PULL YOUR HAIR OUT!""<br>
Kelly: ""Shut up."" <br>
...like it didn't even phase her. Well, I definatly found that funny.<br>
Then, an even younger sister pulls down a picture from the
refrigerator, she says to me, ""that's Ed. that's Mike."" (pointing to 2
of the boys) ""Ed thinks this is Mike....he's an idiot"" And I was
hysterical. It was thee funniest thing ever.<br>
I saw the new baby, and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">she's adorable</span>.&nbsp; We left with 3 of the boys; but not before Matt gave me a cute little hug. I love him; soo cute.<br>
<br>
We met back up with Staci, her sister, and her sister's friend, and all 8 of us, headed to that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">stupid</span> Hawley carnival. I didn't go on many rides because I<span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);""> refuse</span> to go on anything that goes backwards. <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">A slice of pizza</span>, <span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 255);"">a bottle of water</span>, <span style=""color: rgb(153, 102, 51);"">a funnel cake</span>,<span style=""color: rgb(192, 192, 192);""> a powdered sugar fight</span>, and about <span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">20 dollars</span>
later, it was time, for one-last-ride. So everyone but, me and 3 of
Maureen's brothers got on that stupid backwards wheel, while I felt
sick, and we'll say ""ruined a chance""?<br>
<br>
After the carnival, me, Staci, and her sister and her friend, walked back to Staci's house (notice this is the 4th trip I've made.) and her mom drove me home.<br>
<br>
Overall, the day was fun, a night to remember, and let's hope that we all get together again, and have a blast.<br>"

I am the first one in the van so I go to the very last row, and slide <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">alllll</span> the way over.&nbsp; Melissa's next. She slides in right next to me.&nbsp; Then two other kids fit in with us...so I'm <span style=""font-style: italic;"">squished</span> into the window. I casually turn my head towards the window, and screeeam, ""<font style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 153);"" size=""4"">MOVE OVER!! EVERYONE!

Melissa has no idea what's going on, until she sees the wasp, being my
friend, she understands and doesnt make me sit near the window, but
that doesnt solve the problem of the kid on the floor, so I scrunch
down inbetween the sits, so Melissa may move closer to the window and
the kid can get off the floor.&nbsp; I think everyone on the van thinks
I'm crazy, <font size=""5""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 0);"">but atleast I wasn't stung.</span></font><br>

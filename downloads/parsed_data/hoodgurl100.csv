"event","Yesterday was a bad day for me becuase i left my grandma house and i was not going to leave until today so that was one thing that made the day bad then we was going to go to the drive-in and then when we got home my mom said we are not going and i think the only reason why she said we was going to the drive-in is becuase she didnt want to speed another night at my grandma house and she didnt want me to ask her if we could spend another night becuase she didnt want to stay down there. For some reason my mom and her brother does not like my grandma and that makes me feel really bad becuase that is there mtoher and i beat if me and my sister and bro9ther did that to my mom she would be really upset and i think when i get order im going to see my grandma more then my mom just to show her how it feels.

"event","The other night was the crochester party and it was fun. when i thought about it i had some doubts   so i just decided to go becuase there was nothing else to do, when we got there it was wierd because the wood chopping shit was there and we thought that we couldnt stay but we did. Some people came like carolAnn and spring. Then we saw these people getting like swords and shields and all this other shit. it was cool becuase carolAnn, Spring, and i went and asked some quistions and they got there gear on and started fighting. it was a cool night and we played frisbee and ate and drank pop.   Sorry i havent updated my journal in a while i have been busy modifing my computer.  umm. so in conclusion,(haha) partrys are fun.

"event","Today was a thursday and it was a good day. Right now i am watching ""steve harveys big time."" Its a joke because the only thing that they do on this show is show off peoples talents. Some people are pretty good but some are really dumb like the one that I'm watching now which is a chicken wing eating contest. Another talent was a sumo wresaling and one guy wieghed 740 pounds and the other one was 440. You can guess who won (this might require some thinking).Tommarow is a friday and the last one of the school year. This weekend i have to work both days and I have to study for finals. OOO. sweet come just came on (current time=9:oo )

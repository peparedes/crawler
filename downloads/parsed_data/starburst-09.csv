Nikki, I have been playing the field so to say, I was just curious to see what was out there, you havent seemed interested in me romantically in the slightest and i dunno I was just curious. Something good came of all this though. I realized that there is no one out there. You cared about me when no one did and believed in me when no one else would. I miss you nikki... I want to talk to you when i get home from blacksburg on the second.

What do I do? Help....I found out that this guy at work has it really bad for me. He came over last night because neither one of us had anything else to do and we ended up drinking so he stayed the night and we had a great time. He is not the normal guy that I would go for but he is such a sweetheart and a good guy. I think I like him but I just started to get to know him and I would like to  get to know him better. Like I have said before I am not ready for anouther relationship right now. I don't want to lose Mike as a friend but I have a feeling he is going to want to get back together with me and I just don't want that. He also said that if I started seeing other guys that he is not going to hang around and watch that. I should have never started dateing him in the first place, we should have just stayed friends. So why did I stay with him for so long? And how do I keep him as a friend even though I want to see what is going to happen with Scott (the guy at work)."

We have been getting along great, granted I have only been here for one day and most of that has been me moveing in. I'm just really excited to be here and not have to be at home listening to my parents argue all the time or to deal with all the crap at home. Anyway, just wanted to give everyone an update about what is going on over here. :D"

"event","I don't know what to do, I've been feeling like a complete ass with how I ended it with Mike. I don't know what to do, I feel this need to message him and tell him if he is ready I would like to sit down and talk to him. Explaine things like I should have done the night he came down, but Matt would not quite calling and he wanted to come out side so bad I couldn't say the things that I needed to say. Maybe I did fall for Matt too quickley, maybe I am just feeding off the feelings he has for me and takeing them as my own feelings for him. He is living in my dorm right now, and I don't see him makeing any moves to get anouther apartment. He has stopped talking to me about us getting an apartment together but he hasnt talked to me about him getting one without me either. He does know that my parents are comeing down this weekend for Junior Dad's and the he needs to be gone Thurday night, but he is not makeing any moves to get gone. Also, I think liveing with him so soon is not the best of ideas, I was just getting cought up in the whirlwind of having someone pay so much attention to me and all that after being with Mike who stopped paying attention to me. I just don't know what to do. I want some alone time, I pretty much right now have a roommate and I am not getting any work done. I can't tell him he needs to go because he doesn't have anywhere to go right now. But if I don't then I will continue to not get any work done and I can't afford that at this point in the semester. I want to tell him he should go to California, where he dreams of going to live with his brother and become a cop. But he says he wont leave without me. Well it may take me a while to leave, also I have this whole modeling thing that I want to see what comes of that and I may be traveling all over the world persuing my dream. How is he going to deal with that? He has already told me that there are some photo shoots that he does not want me to ever do, and I am sorry but that is my call not his and if he can't deal with it then we wernt ment to be anyway. He needs to understand that I am not going to put my dreams on hold for him just because he is willing to do the same thing for me. I never asked him to, I told him that he should go and chase his dreams that I will be here. I mean hell if Anja and Alex can make it work with the ociean between them why can't Matt and I make it work across the country? He says he will not leave the state without me, well I may be leaveing the country with out him if I do get signed to an agency. I just don't know what to do. The only thing I know is that he needs to be out of the dorm before my parents get here this weekend. And he can't really come back because I am leaveing for Thanksgiving break after this weekend and then we have finals and then Winter break after that. So he better figure out something."

"event","I know my parents will not be completley happy with this but Matt and I are serously thinking about getting an apartment together. I know that people are saying that it may be too soon, but when you know you have the one you are suppoused to be with forever it is really hard to wait to be together. It's not like I'm giving up school or running off to get married right away, we just want to live together and be together. He understands that school is what I need to be doing right now and he is completly supportive, I mean he has even helped me with my algebra and I actually understand it when he helps. I love him and I want to be with him, and I can't wait to get married one day but that wont be until I am done with school. But yeah, we are looking at getting a place maybe in Staunton or Waynesboro and me moveing in after this semester. Daddy was the one who was all happy and supportive about me getting an apartment with Evie, i think the only problem will be who the apartment is going to be with. Not the fact that I'm getting one. Wish me luck, cause I'm gonna need it."

"event","I can't wait till we are all back at school, I need my girls so much right now. Mike and I are having some problems. He thinks sometimes that he may be holding me back from finding a great guy who is good enough for me, someone who is more settled with their lives someone who is more like me. Also he thinks that when he goes away to school that we are going to have issues with the long distance relationship thing (he is most likely going to go to JMU, not that long distance!) He is worried that we are going to break up when he goes away to school, he is baseing this off of Drew and Rachel because their long distance relationship didn't work. First of all we are not Drew and Rachel, and second of all I am not as crazy as Rachel is not even a little bit. I never really thought about his going to school being a bad thing for the relationship, not until he brought it up at the beach last night. I still think he is crazy. But what has been bothering me is that the more time we spend together the less we have in common. I do love him, I love him a lot; it's just that for all the time we spend together only about an hour a day is he truly acting his age. He acts so immiture (probably spelled wrong), especally when he is around Drew. He's just been really annoying me lately and he has been noticing it too. Last time he noticed me getting irritated with him he freaked out and broke up with me. I almost thought he was gonna do that last night while we were talking on the beach. I don't want to break up with him and I don't want him to break up with me, but I think something needs to change or maybe.....I don't know, I just don't know what to do."

Also I will finally be getting my car back, hopefully, by the end of this week, which means I will be getting a job. I am curious if I will actually get a roommate next year at school since my roomie wont be comming back. I was thinking about not comming back to Baldwin next year myself. I havent been really happy there and everyone has heard me at some point say how much I hate school and I hate being there, or how much I hate being home. I was thinking I would get an apartment in C-ville and getting a full time job and just takeing a couple classes at Piedmont; but I don't think I will do that. So far things have cooled down and this summer is starting to look like I can get through it and next semester is the first one I have been looking forward to since I started college. I think I just needed to get out of the slump I was in. Although I did take a step back in my personal achievements, that I overcame this past semester, the second week I was home. But that's ok, it all worked out in the end. So for now things are going well. I really want to get together with some people from school before the summer is over. I miss you all."

"event","So, I just finished my final and I think I did pretty well. I am sad to be leaveing Baldwin, I'm gonna miss it here, and the people....well...some of them.  It has been a interesting year, filled with tears, pain, love, happiness, all the usual stuff.  School could have been better but oh well, I'll make up for that later.  I don't want to be going home, I kinda pretty much hate Buckingham but it's ok becuase I'll be getting my car back as soon as possible. :D I can't wait.  This summer is going to be fun though, I'm planning on getting a job again (I can't wait!!!) I have missed working; also, I'm going to be spending a lot of time with Mike (as usual) and the rest of his group.  It's going to be an awsome summer...you know, except for that whole Buckingham thing. But I'm staying positive and excited about it all.  The Rents are comming down tomorrow to help me pack and move out, then only three and a half months before I get to come back to Baldwin. I hate packing, It's not that packing is hard, it's just annoying. Moving in is so much better than moving out. 
Well, I guess thats it for now. See you all next year, hope you all have wonderful summers and all that good stuff. Love you all.....well most of you :P"

Becuase they are talking at full volume, and since our library only has students working in it there is no one to tell them to shut up. There are six people working here and they are all too busy playing on the computers to do anything about the noise. Oh and what the hell is up with talking on cell phones in the library? They should have a no cell phone sign. People are idoits! I have been trying to write a paper for about an hour and I have less than half a page because it is too loud in here. The funny thing about all this is that my paper is for my philosophy class and I have to decide which philosopher I most agree with about human nature. And the longer I am in here with these stupid people, who don't understand that people come to the library for quite to do their work, the more I am leaning toward Schopenhauer who has a very pessimistic view of human nature. So my paper is going to be all ""Humans suck! For the most part they are so stupid! They can not even follow simple rules. We should restrict breeding so only the smart ones are allowed to have children. And that cuts out the people with whom I share the library tonight.""

Oh, my baby, when you're older
Maybe then you'll understand
You have angels to dance around you shoulders
'Cause at times in life you need a loving hand

Oh, my baby, when you're prayin'
Leave your burden by my door
You have Jesus standing by your bedside
To keep you calm, keep you safe,
Away from harm

Worry not my daughters,
Worry not my sons
Child, when life don't seem worth livin'
Come to Jesus and let Him hold you in His arms

Oh, my baby, when you're cryin'
Never hide your face from me
I've conquered hell and driven out the demons
I have come with a life to set you free

Worry not my daughters,
Worry not my sons
Child, when life don't seem worth livin'
Come to Jesus and let Him hold you in His arms

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Believe the healing of His hand
Here in Heaven we will wait for your arrival
Here in Heaven you will finally understand
Here in Heaven we will wait for your arrival

""One Moment More""

Hold me
Even though I know you're leaving
And show me
All the reasons you would stay
It's just enough to feel your breath on mine
To warm my soul and ease my mind
You've got to hold me and show me now

Give me
Just one part of you to cling to
And keep me
Everywhere you are
It's just enough to steal my heart and run
And fade out with the falling sun

Oh, please don't go
Let me have you just one moment more
Oh, all I need
All I want is just one moment more
You've got to hold me and keep me

Tell me that someday you'll be returning
And maybe
Maybe I'll believe
It's just enough to see a shooting star
To know you're never really far
It's just enough to see a shooting star
To know you're never really gone

Oh, please don't go
Let me have you just one moment more
Oh, all I need
All I want is just one moment more

Oh, please don't go
Let me have you just one moment more
Oh, all I need

Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

How you could easily take my man

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

~Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm~

Once there was this kid who
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
But when he finally came back
His hair had turned from black into bright white
He said that it was from when
The car had smashed so hard

Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm

Once there was this girl who
Wouldn't go and change with the girls in the change room
But when they finally made her
They saw birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just been there

Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm

But both girl and boy were glad
'Cause one kid had it worse than that

'Cause then there was this boy whose
Parents made him come directly home right after school
And when they went to their church
They shook and lurched all over the church floor
He couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just gone there

Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm


~The Ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead~

Peter Pumpkinhead came to town
Spreading wisdom and cash around
Fed the starving and housed the poor
Showed the vatican what gold's for
But he made too many enemies
Of the people who would keep us on our knees
Hooray for Peter Pumpkin
Who'll pray for Peter Pumpkinhead?
Oh my!
Peter Pumpkinhead pulled them all
Emptied churches and shopping malls
Where he spoke, it would raise the roof
Peter Pumpkinhead told the truth
But he made too many enemies...
Peter Pumpkinhead put to shame
Governments who would slur his name
Plots and sex scandals failed outright
Peter merely said
Any kind of love is alright
But he made too many enemies...
Peter Pumpkinhead was too good
Had him nailed to a chunk of wood
He died grinning on live TV
Hanging there he looked a lot like you
And an awful lot like me!
But he made too many enemies...
Hooray for Peter Pumpkin
Who'll pray for Peter Pumpkin
Hooray for Peter Pumpkinhead
Oh my oh my oh!
Doesn't it make you want to cry oh?

<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Moon is all about visions and illusions, madness, genius and poetry. This is a card that has to do with sleep, and so with both dreams and nightmares. It is a scary card in that it warns that there might be hidden enemies, tricks and falsehoods. But it should also be remembered that this is a card of great creativity, of powerful magic, primal feelings and intuition. You may be going through a time of emotional and mental trial; if you&nbsp;have any past mental problems, you must be vigilant in taking your medication but avoid drugs or alcohol, as abuse of either will cause them irreparable damage. This time however, can also result in great creativity, psychic powers, visions and insight. You can and should trust your intuition.</font></p>

"event","So i go to class, yes i actually went to class, and my teacher comes in with her usualy bad attitude and snotty comments. and ya know what she does? she kicks me and like 4 other girls out of class. ok so we didnt have our drafts done, but we all had legitment excuses for not doing them. ok so mine wasnt completley legit. but it does stem from real problems. anyway, so now im sitting in the library trying to work on my paper which i have no clue how to write cause i am really bad at takeing on someone elses perspective and trying to figure out how they would respond to something, thats waht i have to do for my paper topic, which i think is stupid. i have never been kicked out of class before, well, one other time but that was in high school and the teacher was just being stupid and the principal sent me right back. prof. turner sent us here to the library to work, so that is why im here instead of going back to my room or something, and she better not mark us absent cause we went to class, she is the one who kicked us out. well i guess i better try to write something about this paper so i can show her that i am trying to get my work done even though she piles it on us like we dont have anyother class in which we have work to do, and i dont think she realizes that we actualy have lives outside of her class. cause i dont know about anyone else in that class but i have other things that dont have anything dealing with school that i am trying to deal with and her attitude sure isnt helping me with my trying to force myself back in to the whole school thing. and ya know what else bugs me? in high school all my teachers told me that i gotta be responsible for myself and get to class on time and actually go to class, because in college the professor wont care whether you go to class or not, ect... FUCK THAT!! attendence counts more in this COLLEGE than it did in my HIGH SCHOOL! WTF!! i really want to transfer and it sucks that i cant, over half of my english calss is transfering either after this semester or after this year. they are smart little freshman. bah...."

"event","So today I turned 19 and all I wanna do right now is go home. My dad would have cooked me a great birthday meal, anything I would want, most likely STEAK (yum). My mom would have made me a cake with candles and everything. The whole day would be about me, god I miss being at home. My girls have been great today about it being my birthday, having everyone at lunch and dinner, but there is nothing like a brithday at home with all the traditions of home. 
~
Life is moving on, very fast. It seems like yesterday I was beging my Senior year in high school, hanging out with Steph, James, and Charlie all night (and getting in so much trouble doing it). Then I had turned 18, talk about a mile stone in someone's life. I had lived 18 years and seen so many things, been through so many things in my life. And before I knew it I was graduating from high school. Everyone knows how important that is. I still can't belieave that they actually let me graduate. Summer flew by and bam it hit me....I was starting my freshman year in COLLEGE. I was so scared, I didn't know what to expect. I was sure that I wouldn't make any friends that no one would like me. But I was wrong, I made 5 of the best friends anyone could ever ask for. The are more like my sisters instead of my friends. We do everything together, god do we have fun. We will be friends for a long time, and the memories that we have made this year will last us forever. I will never forget them or what we have been through this year. I finished my first semester in college, and did ok. I could have done a lot better but give me a break it was my first semester. I have gotten in to trouble, been to clubs, met guys, and gotten drunk. So, now I'm 19. Looking back this has been a very busy and life altering year. I have learned so much about myself and the world around me. And with all the headachs, heartachs, and tears, I would do it all over again. I loved every min. of it, and I can't wait to see what is to come in this new year of my life. What I do know is my sisters will be there with me to celebrate everyday of it."

"event","I had the best morning ever!! It started out with a fun night out, with Drew, Anja, Evie, and I. We went clubbing, which is always fun, if you can find a nice guy to dance with, and Evie and I did. Well really they found us, Brian and Chad. Well we dance with them, we lose the guys in the club (too many people). Then when the club was closing we saw them walking (we were in my car), the guys and all of us agreed to meet up at SHEETS. Well the next move was theirs, they invited Evie and I to go ridding with them (we were gonna go 4-wheelen, but there wasn't enough snow). Any way, Evie and I agree (after makeing sure it was ok with Anja and Drew, Anja and Drew took my car back to the dorms, and Evie and I went for an amazing adventure. We had alcohol, two cute boys, and we were sitting on top of a mountain (with a beautiful view). We had so much fun, and I am pretty sure we are gonna see Brian and Chad again, soon........(I hope I will see Brian again). Brian and I got along really well, I usually have a hard time talking to guys I first meet but it was easy to talk to him (maybe because I was a little wasted at the time). We didn't get back to the dorms till 7:40am this morning, since the boys drove us back they just crashed in our rooms. :) I only got about two to three hours of sleep this morning so when I went to work at two this afternoon I was so tired. I almost fell asleep at work when I was learning the menue. Even worse, I almost fell asleep driving to AND from work. But at least I had fun, I needed that. Now I am very tired, and hungry, lucky me I got chicken fingers and fries from work...... :P  

P.S. 
Evie and I know the decisions we made last night and in to the morning could have ended up so bad, but the didn't. We are big girls, and we understood what risks we were putting ourselves in. We took a chance and it ended very well. Yes, we were lucky that Brian and Chad are nice guys. And we were careful, we keep in contact with Anja and Drew all morning (kinda, when they wern't asleep, and when they were we left messages), also we looked after eachother. And on top of everything we had good feelings about these guys, like I said we are big girls and we can make our own decisions, and we did this morning."

"event","""GREAT ADVICE""

Don't date because you are desperate.
Don't marry because you are miserable.
Don't have kids because you think your genes are superior. 
Don't philander because you think you are irresistible.

Don't associate with people you can't trust.
Don't cheat. Don't lie. Don't pretend.
Don't dictate because you are smarter.
Don't demand because you are stronger.

Don't sleep around because you think you are old enough and know better.
Don't hurt your kids because loving them is harder. 
Don't sell yourself, your family, or your ideals. 
Don't stagnate.

Don't regress.
Don't live in the past. Time can't bring anything or anyone back. 
Don't put your life on hold for possibly Mr/Mrs Right. 
Don't throw your life away on absolutely Mr Wrong because your biological clock is ticking.

Learn a new skill.
Find a new friend.
Start a new career.
Sometimes, there is no race to be won. 
Only a price to be paid for some of life's more hasty decisions.

To terminate your loneliness, reach out to the homeless.
To feed your nurturing instincts, care for the needy.
To fulfill your parenting fantasies, get a puppy.
Don't bring another life into this world for all the wrong reasons.

To make yourself happy, pursue your passions and be the best of what you can be. Simplify your life. Take away the clutter. 
Get rid of destructive elements: abusive friends, nasty habits, and dangerous liaisons. 
Don't abandon your responsibilities but don't overdose on duty.

Don't live life recklessly without thought and feeling for your family.
Be true to yourself. Don't commit when you are not ready. 
Don't keep others waiting needlessly.

Go on that trip. Don't postpone it.
Say those words. Don't let the moment pass.
Do what you have to, even at society's scorn.

Write poetry.
Love Deeply.
Walk barefoot.
Dance with wild abandon.
Cry at the movies.

Take care of yourself. Don't wait for someone to take care of you. 
You light up your life. You drive yourself to your destination. 
No one completes you - except YOU.

It is true that life does not get easier with age. It only gets more challenging. 
Don't be afraid. Don't lose your capacity to love. Pursue your passions.

Live your dreams.
Don't lose faith in your God.
Don't grow old. Just grow YOU!

"event","I guess it finally dawned on me you've gone 
Well maybe I can make it on my own 
I don't stay up wonderin' if you'll call 
And some nights I don't dream of you at all 


Your memory's still hurtin' deep inside 
That's something I'm still learning how to hide 
Though this heart of mine has lost an ache or two 
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue 


CHORUS: 
Lookin' down the line sometimes 
I think I see a change 
But then I think again and think of you 
Here and there I've turned a stone 
But the mountain hasn't moved 
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue 


I'm still afraid of turning out the light 
And it takes all my strength to face the night 
Cause that's the time I face the bitter truth 
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

"event","I love being at home, but I just can't wait to get back home (to school I mean). I miss everyone so much, there is really no one here to hang with. Steph is with James all the time, I can't get her to do anything without him. God I just want her to find someone better. All I am doing lately is working at IHOP and hanging out at home. My sis and I are going to a SPA next Thursday (Christmas present from Trey, her husband) I have had enough of being home for a while. I just need to get out and do something without my parents and I don't mean going to work. Don't get me wrong I love my parents and I don't know what I would do without them. But I had forgotten how annoying they can get. 

I do have good news. I found my cat, she had been missing for almost two months, and I found her last night!!!! My dad let her stay in the house last night, so she wouldnt run away again. The reason why she left in the first place was because of our dog Shadow. He attacked her. Stupid Dog!!!!  

I was able to see my sister already. She is doing good, I had more fun seeing her for a day than I have hanging with my parents the whole first week I was home. Now that is sad.

I am sitting in the public library right now, no internet at home. :(  But I can deal, I had a dentist appt. today. Oh, that was fun (not). And then I have a doctors appt. at 2 this afternoon. And I am starving, I think I'm gonna head on over to Subway after my doctors appt. 

All in all, I can't wait for school to start again. Not because I wanna start the classes. I just miss seeing my girls all the time. I really didn't realize how much time I spent with them till I couldn't see them. Also, I didn't know how much I love them till I got a chance to miss them. Whiplash, Hot Shot, Tink, Sling Shot, and Pyro you girls are my best friends. Since I was an Army Brat I never allowed myself to get close to anyone growing up, I knew we would move soon enough and I would have to leave everybody. Till Middle School I don't think I ever had a real friend, I always used to hang around my sister and her friends, instead of making some of my own. Even in middle and high school I didn't have any really good friends. I had the kind of friends you hang with only if you have a class with them or you have lunch together, not the kind you go out of your way to hang out with or that you would see after school. Ya'll know the type I'm sure. Even Step Maysymiuk is not a best friend, we hardley see eachother. And she lives two min. away from me. We both can drive and we never see eachother. I love you girls, and I don't know what I would do without you all. College would deffintaly not be as much fun as it is without all of you. I miss you all so much and I can't wait to see you when school starts again. I love you girls like whoa!!!!!"

"event","It is a weird feeling when you suddenly see everything you wanted start to faid away. I know what I dream in life and I have always been really optimistic about reaching my dreams, but now I can't see them so clearly now. I don't know what my future holds, I don't know what I am going to do about anything. I want to be the same person I was before, but that is not possible. I feel like I am losing myself, I don't know what to do. I want to see if I could make it out there in the world, but I everything I try to do just doesn't come through like I wanted it to. Nothing turns out right. I have always said to hold on to your dreams, but now.... Not so much anymore, it is to hard to see that it could never happen. That I have always dreamed too big for me. I was trying to say I could do anything, but now I am growing up and I see that there are things that are just not possible. Things that I saw myself doing in the past, I know I will never get the chance to do. It is not worth the effort anymore to dream. My hopes just get to high, and everytime I could see how something could work, it doesn't come through. I want so bad to be a model, an actress, and a singer, but I know that it will never be true. I will never be anything that I used to see myself being. Only by a merical will I get to do anything of thoes things. As it is now, I don't see me being anything special. My dreams are faiding away and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to bring my dreams back. I don't know how to react to what is going on inside me. I don't want to lose my hope, but I can see it leaving....very quickly. Why is it when we get older, all our dreams leave us? I don't want to know the truth, that the possibility of me being famous is slim to none. I want to have the faith I used to have. I want to be the old Nicole again. I don't want to be the person I see now. I want to be someone else, I don't know how to deal with the person I am now. I see me and I don't see how I became this way. I have had terrible things done to me in the past, things that are truly unfair and that I shouldn't have had to go through, and I keep pushing those thing further and further back in my heart and head. As if they didn't happen or that I just can't deal with them anymore. The strong person who I used to be is faiding away fast. I used to be able to handle my family and make everything better, now I don't know what to do. I am lost, and I can't seem to find my way back to me. I want to be whole, but I have lost a vital part of Nicole. I don't feel like Nicole anymore. What people see everyday is just a shell. A shell of what I used to be. I am changing, and with what I can tell, it is not the best kind of change. It's not fair, I was just starting to like Nicole, and then I lose her. I have so many feelings inside me that I can't show, no one would understand. I just want to be someone else right now, I don't even want to be the same Nicole I used to be. I don't think that I could ever be the same again. Too many things have happened, but I don't want to be who I am becoming. I'm loseing too many things about myself. Too many things were stolen from me."

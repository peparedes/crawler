"event","who are my friends? who do I want to be my friends? I have friends I think but I don?t
have a group of friend I guess that is what I want. but not all of my friends get along so well so to be in a grope of friends, I would have to louse some friends and I know I don?t want to do that. It would be nice if all my friends where friends (why cant we be friends why cant we be friends) heh. sorry IM not to good a singing. specking of not being good at things reminds me that IM not overly good at anything really, and this might be why I don?t have a grope of friends. there is not really anything that I really like to do I don?t have a hobby. how sad. so I don?t have a hobbies to do with friends. but it not true that a rope of friends has to share the same interests, though ppl that skate tend to chill together and ppl that are in theter then to act together and so on. to know how my friends are I must know who I am... right easier said then done."

      <p>There is a reason why Nintendo tried to limit my involvement to giving out clues and various other insignificant tasks. That is because I can't last a whole game as the center of attention without smoking some pot. I am pretty fun to chill with, as long as no one makes snide remarks about my height, but I am not suitable for young children. This doesn't bother me too much. I don't crave the spotlight like others do. I have my friends, my bong, my weed, and a constant paycheck so I can get more weed. Being Toad rocks muchly.</p>

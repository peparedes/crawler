"event","<lj-cut text=""The article""><i>When I sat down with Justin Timberlake (Robson) and Wade Robson (Timberlake), the two were anything but popstars.  They were both humble and very much into letting people know who they are as fathers, musicians, and people.

As I sat around for hours watching their photo shoot, the joy and love the two had for each other was plainly seen as they goofed around during pillow fights or rolled around in the bed sharing sweet kisses.  These two are very much in love with each other as well as their little boy Jeremy Randall Robson/Timberlake (They argued over which it would be, and never did decide on it.  So it depends on who you are talking to on the last name of their son.)

Justin spoke highly of his love for Wade, ""I knew when I saw him that I was in love.  It wasn't something that just happened.  It was a process that started the day I met him, I was just scared he didn't feel the same.  Had I known he felt the same way I wouldn't have waited as long as I did.""

Now we've heard from Britney how Justin's surprised her with spelling  her name out in roses on her bed on an anniversary, Wade explains how Justin, over the years, has kept small mementos.  ""When we first got together he told me the night we first kissed, he took a napkin from the club we were at.  Then when we first shared a bed, he took the pillow case.  The list goes on, but that's just an example.  I thought it was absolutely adorable.  And the thing about it, is he'd been doing it even before that.""

The two know that when it comes to today's society they don't have it all that easy.  ""We know it's frowned upon.  But it's who we are.  We've both said that we wanted to be as honest to our fans as possible.  I'm not gonna lie about who I love.  If they can't like me because of it, then that's their problem.  It may sound a bit rude, but my sexuality doesn't make me who I am.  It's just apart of me.""

Wade nodded in agreement as he smiled watching Justin.  Even now as I watch the two, the love between them is strong.  I have to say that I got a bit teary eyed as I watched Wade craddle Jeremy to him and start feeding him a bottle.  It was a very adorable sight and started to get a bit distracting at the interview went on.  I just wanted to watch him with Jeremy.

""We don't want people to treat us any different.  And we hope that if anything this helps people out there that are afraid to face their sexuality.  It's difficult, to admit it to yourself, much less someone else.  But when you do, no matter the outcome, you feel like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders.  Homosexuality, in today's world, isn't that big a controversy as it was 5 years ago.  You have shows about it like Will and Grace and Queer as Folk, that speak very openly about homosexual relationships.  Something that wouldn't even grace the presence of speech 5 years ago much less tv.  Times change, and it's not that great a deal anymore.""

""I believe our fans will stick by our sides no matter what.  If they don't then that just proves they aren't as true as they say they are.""  After speaking Justin reaches over and squeezes Wade's hand softly.  It was then that I realized he'd been doing it through the whole interview.  The two lean on each other very much so when it comes to strenghth and courage.  As long as they have each other they can pull through anything.  

As time goes by, Justin and Wade both know that things will get hard.  Justin and his solo album, Wade and his tv show (which airs next year on MTV).  They both know that time together will be few and far between.  But their love stands strong and they know the other is only a phone call away.  No matter where the other is, the other is close behind.</i>

"event","Is soo beautiful right now.  It's freezing, so we can't do much with Jeremy.  Don't want him to get sick.  Justin just got over the flu.  God I pray I don't get it.  It's possible with that shoot.. *slowly smiles* That shoot we did the other day.  *shakes my head* Let me start from the begining.

Justin had promo's to do in New York.  It started off with a sit down Q & A session with New York Times, New York Post, SevenTeen, People, and TeenPeople.  Of course I was there, watching from the sidelines as usual.  It's the spot I like.  Because I'm seriously the type of guy that likes it in the background.  Sure I've had my face shoved in front of a camera and I've been caught on tape.  Done photoshoots and what not, but that wasn't by choice.  Trust me.  If it were my choice I'd be in the background away from the public eyes as much as possible.

Anyway, I got pulled out of the darkness when Justin started talking about Jeremy and I.  It was very clear how uncomfortable I was, but Justin kept giving me reassuring smiles, and squeezing my hand.  Jeremy's just as much a ham as Justin.  He just sat there all chum and smirking around his thumb.  It was quite adorable.  And it just so happened that Justin had dressed him that day.  He had on these blue leather pants, and this white little button down, with these silve frammed baby sunglasses with blue lenses.  *shakes my head* Looked just like Justin minus the curls.

He had the next day off, but he was supposed to do this interview and shoot for Out Magazine.  But Justin was too delirous an just, sick to go.  I had a doctor come see him and he was diagnosed with the Flu and I wasn't gonna let him go out in this weather, sick.  So I called and cancelled.  Went and got Justin's medicine and his coloring book he asked for.

The next day he was doing much better.  I let him talk me into going to the interview and shoot for Out Magazine later that night.  He forgot to mention that they wanted me to do the shoot and interview as well.  He also forgot to mention that it was a very much naked and exposed shoot.  He told me, just later right before we left.  I was very skeptical and very self conscious and, well afraid.  Even if Justin was there, it was a great comfort that he was there, I was just.. I just wish I'd been told and warn ahead of time.. not a few minutes before I guess.

But it went really well.  *slow smile* Better then well I think.  I think the reader will see a side of Justin no one sees but me.  And I don't mean his nakedness when I say that.  I mean you can see his affection as a husband/lover, his charisma as a father, and the Justin that no one but me knows.

You get to see him acting as a kid while playing around of pillow fight or the playful tickle fight we got in.  

You get to see the love he has for only those close enough to know the real Justin, while he's resting in a bed smiling down at me.

The gentleness he has when it comes to love, affection, and passion, yet the rawness and need he has when it comes to his desires and wants.  

*talks all about Justin, and not a single thing about myself.*

*slowly smiles, remembering just how far things went with that photoshoot.  giggles thinking about that girl who was obsessing over Justin's package.*

When it was all said and done.  When the photo session ended, the last picture that was taken.  *looks to my copy frammed next to the hotel bed.  Smiling* Just said it all, what we are.

*The picture of Justin and I dressed in thick white robes our names on the left side.  stretched out on the bed, which is fixed up with navy silk sheets and comforter.  mounds of pillows surrounding them.  Our heads pressed together looking straight at the camera.  Standing between us with the help of myself is Jermey in his baby blue fuzzy feeted pj's.  his head leaning towards Justin, his thumb in his mouth, his other hand reaching out and resting against my neck his little arm resting against my shoulder.* 

A family."

But just one touch is more than enough to understand 
There's a master plan And although 
I know I don't believe in destiny 
Maybe it found me 
Now my world is filled with so many things 
But nothing compares to the touch of your skin 
There's a symphony 
And a melody that plays whenever you're around 
I think I've been found
 
I can see the sun 
And I can feel the rain 
I can hear the wind call your name 
I can feel your love 
But there's one thing I can't do 
I can't ever get enough of you
 
Now I know that in the past 
I've been much too keen 
But your eyes are the kindest that I've ever seen 
I guess there are some things you just know 
There's a voice inside telling me to hold on 
And never let you go 
There's a tune that plays 
It's a sacred sound 
It's a symphony I hear whenever you're around 
Now my world is filled 
With a whisper of love and a promise of tomorrow 
I can see the sun 
And I can feel the rain 
I can hear the wind call your name 
I can feel your love 
But there's one thing I can't do 
I can't ever get enough of you
 
When we make love I lose track of time 
I can't count all the colors I see in your eyes 
And while your heart beats in mine, it's true 
I can't ever get enough of you

when we first found out, things were hesitant, and not so great.  but now that he's here, it's incredible.  he's incredible.  both my husband and baby boy.  my family.  *sighs contently.  looking over my shoulder at the two curled up in the bed.*

"event","Some very strange things have happened over the last few weeks.  Things that have caused major changes in my life as well as Justin's.  Things I can't really get into, things you don't really need to know.  *slowly runs my tongue over my right canine.*  I'm not really sure about all this.  I know Justin is a bit uncomfortable with a few things.  So I have to try hard not to do those things around him or at all.

One thing I know that hasn't changed is I love my husband very very very much.  He's just so sexay.

I love you baby!"

"event","*sings with Muppets take Manhatten, still thinks it's the best despite Justin and his Muppets in Space.  nose scrunches up a bit, then goes back to watching the movie*

Justin is the cutest thing ever.  

Let me tell you what he's been doing.  And now that he told me, I realize that I saw him doing some of these things, but I didn't realize exactly what he was doing.  Or just thought him weird.  Kidding kidding.

Anyway..

The first night we went out, night after my birthday, we went to the Viper Room.  He took a napkin I had used.  I wasn't completely sure as to why, then he told me it was because that's where we shared our first kiss.  *smiles slightly*

When we were in Russia, he took Lance's pillow cause because that was the first time we'd slept together.  Like you know shared a bed.

Then on the way to Hawaii we um.. he umm yeah and well when we came back from the bathroom this lady was laughing and smirking at me and making me blush.  And Justin leaned over and told me I had toliet paper on my shoe.  I died.  I hid, I was soo embarrassed.  Justin and that lady both laughing at me.  But Justin took it off and put it in his back.  I was quite curious as to why, I later found out it was because it was the first time.. well umm yeah..

When we got to Hawaii the first thing we did was get married.  It wasn't anything to special.  It was just us, and it was the best expierence of my life.  He took the ministers collar *snickers* Then we went to the hotel.  I swear I saw him packing the sheets away in our bag earlier.  I'm not sure.

We're on our way home now.  Justin has to be in NY tomorrow for TRL and 106 and Park on Tuesday.  I'm going with him.  I took off a month because I didn't know how long we'd be in Russia.  

Anyway that's all I have to say.  Oh wait..

I LOVE YOU JUSTIN RANDALL ROBSON!

WEEeee!"

It's nice to see a true smile on Justin's face.  We might have to stay here for awhile if it means him being happy.

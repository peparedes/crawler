"event","Well now I have been to my doctor and had all kinds of tests done, she finally said I am anemic so she did a ultrasound on my abdomen, why? To see if there was a reason why I am anemic. Well there is a fibroid tumor in my uterus of all places and it is large at least 5-6cm, but my ovaries are fine. SO I just came back from seeing a ob/gyn and they examined me there too even if I am on my cycle. Now I have to have a vaginal ultrasound to see how big it is and if I have more than 1 inside or outside. I told them the image showed 1 and my ovaries are fine, you think they would listen. Now they give me options on keeping my uterus, but these fibroids can grow back and if I want to have a baby I have to get pregnant in 6 months once they take this one out. I DON'T HAVE OPTIONS FOR HAVING A BABY NOW!!!! To make things worse my other cousin is pregnant with her 3 kid!!! I should have killed myself a looooong time ago."

"event","Well my Tokyo Story Soo doll arrived today and after the kind of work week I had, I am really glad she made it home. She is just lovely in everyway! At my job however they are doing some dirty things. First we had a bitch grip meeting on Tuesday and they fired my co-worker, guess those cameras in the job really work after all. Then another girl quit on my 3-11 shift as well. SO the administrator put a girl from 7-3 shift onto our shift and she is pissed off like a mug! I told Carter what was said in the meeting and she could not believe what I was telling her. The administrator basically was saying if you don't like the work there's the door. And if she fires you she would make sure you can't get unemployment cause she will tell them you did not do your job. So not only was she making threats but when they needed someone to come in, who do you think they kept blowing up to call? ME! No way in heck was I going in there after the comments they made on my shift and my crew! Carter agreed that I should not do any extra shifts in there on my days off. I tell ya what, it did not make any sense whatso ever! Now we have the Supervisor for 3-11 working on my unit and the other med tech on the other unit. I tell ya what when you do dirt you get dirt and when they need help they won't get it from me. I'm doing my job and when it is time to go home I am leaving, and giving them the silent treatment too since they are trying to get rid of folks too. They don't have that many people there now so I don't know why they are tripping out like they are too."

"event","So Jose's b-day was this week and not only did I get him a watch yesterday, but also God of War 3 for the PS3 too. He was going to get it, but I got it for him and he is really happy. I think he loves that watch too. I have been using my camera and finally had uploaded some pics on the computer. I still have to learn how to use it properly, but I am getting the hang of it! I have a set work schedule now and I love it! I just dread working 4 days straight, but at least I do have weekends off and 2 days off in a row. I am only part time, so I really can't complain. I did order another doll, but I also got the bill from the Hospital too. So now I have to work out a plan of paying it off. I'll be glad to get health insurance with Jose. I did pay the initial payment and now I think he will pay the next time, it will only be $115 for both of us and that's not too bad. I can't wait to get my health insurance card so I can go to the doctor and get checked out this year. I have not been since I left Riverpointe. That place is going to blow up one day and when it does I'll be watching on the news. I hope my friend gets all the money she is owed from them too, they did her and me and others wrong over the years and payback is a bitch!"

"event","I think I am about done buying my BJD's, so far I have 1 doll head to send overseas to Germany and 2 that have not arrived yet. Now I will just get clothes, shoes, eyes, wigs for them and I need 1 more doll bench. I am having a hard time finding one and at the right price. I have more health problems so I don't spend as much time with my dolls as I once did. At least the lawsuit I had with a drunk driver is over and everyone got paid and I had my final surgery on my right knee which was needed since it was messed up like the left. I will also be back on 11-7 shift so I can sleep all day and work all night. At least I won't be on my feet as much and re-injure my knees. They are both bad, but what is even worse is having TMJ and I thought my wisdom tooth was causing me problems, but at least that was not the case according to the doctor. I hope it goes away and won't come back, I don't want to see a oral surgeon and such."

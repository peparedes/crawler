When it always feels like autumn
When the wind is slowly turning to north and the flowers die
There is rain falling in my dreams
I must travel again and search for comfort
I must search again for the voice of affection
I must travel again till next autumn
The continuous travel
Till next autumn
When I'm walking on the rocky road throughout life
When it feels like
I'm carrying a sorrow
Then the sun is slowly hiding in the clouds
And the word is goodbye
Soon snow will be falling in my dreams
I must travel again and search for comfort
I must search again for the voice of affection
I must travel again till next autumn
The continuous travel till next autumn"

"event","Ambivalent thoughts consume my daily life since.......well it's been a while. I don't know if it's a product of confusion and frustration or the state of breaking through my spirit's hard shell. If there's one thing that I've learned from my experiences is that love and beauty are prevalent in every person, thing and thought whether they are as black as tar or as white as snow. Although this can be masked by hate, greed, envy and turmoil. Without this creating driving force of existence (love) we wouldn't be here today, in fact NOTHING would so that's why it really pains me to hear people speak such utter tripe such as ""love is a lie"" or ""i have no love in me"" when I hear that I just want to pick that person up and shake them to their core because the one thing most humans do is take for granted this divine force. Love is used so much yet do you understand what it is? how it works? and the different forms it takes on? I heard a person once say ""love is the unrequited feeling of caring for someone without any conditions."" I'm sorry but that is just CARING, it's not love. It's quite an elusive and cryptic concept this thing is.....love, but damn it! don't you see it in everything???? It's in the air you breathe the water you drink (if you can get by the  sodium flouride which kills your brain) the flowers you smell and the animals that bring you warmth and companionship. Have you ever taken a step back and just listened to the wind? or have you tried and listen to the plants that you have a symbiotic relationship with? These plants love you and are grateful for the gift you provide to them, the gift of life (carbon dioxide) and in turn they reciprocate this love back and provide you with oxygen that you feel with every deep breath.


We take for granted this great benign she wolf.....this planet....Gaia.... she is so magnificent in all in splendors and nuances. She is alive and in tune to us all, do you hear her? feel her love? do you love her? Her love is unrequited for you yet you don't care to open your hearts to it, and hell I've been guilty of this as well, I am no better. But I am opening my eyes to this, I'm becoming more aware of her. I feel her pulse, I try and make my heart beat to the sound of her drum for she is the epitome of love and life, for these spew from every one of her orifices to replenish us with our most basic needs. The mass doesn't see this though, all they see are ipods, plasma TV's, Wii's, big cars, big houses, and worst of all...money. Have we been manipulated into prioritizing our thoughts and desires to these materialistic and foolish ""things""? The answer is yes, but I won't go into this here....I'll save that for when I have more time and energy. It really isn't the fault of the people, but it is their responsibility to take care of themselves and be responsible for their every deed and thought. Life is soooooo grand and magnificent that what you think is real, really is not. Truth is stranger than fiction, that's all I know. Ever since realizing that we (the human race) are connected and really one in the same, I have put so much time and feeling for what we do to each other and what the overall mindset of my fellow man is. Some will and have said that this is bad and a waste of time and that I should just focus on being happy and focus on myself. But I beg to differ, THAT is the mindset that is responsible for us being so damn selfish and materialistic. It pisses me of beyond belief to hear people say things like ""I don't care as long as it doesn't affect me"" please people, realize that EVERYTHING affects you, whether you think so or not, it DOES. I feel angry and sad for those with that kind of mindset. The meaning of life isn't to just be happy and care about yourself, it's much much more expansive than that. So much so that I don't think our brains could comprehend such a subject. Our thoughts are very powerful forces, more powerful than words and physical action. Thoughts create possibilities and realities, human speech is just a waste and just slows us down. Just imagine how things could be if we only communicated by thought? telepathy is quite a gift, and it's innate in all of us just like many other gifts. If we could just open our minds and spirits to one another and uniting rather than segregating and closing ourselves off then we would be much better off and really begin to raise our consciousness. What I do affects you and what you do affects me, so please take off your mental blindfolds and realize the true nature of your reality.

I could go on and on but I've babbled enough.

Just remember I love you, all of you. I love you for the hate you hold, the selfishness, the greed, the ignorance, and the un-caring. But I also love you for the love you have, the creative nature of your being, the depth, the uniqueness, and your caring.

Thank you for being you, even if it clashes or blends with me. 


'Cause YOU are a part of me."

My soul died a thousand deaths by the hands of the ""I""
My wishes are dirty and untrue 
My desires are sick and twisted
My countenance reflects your pain, with a crooked smile

My spirit breathes
My essence is intact 
My love never left

There are times I go insane, my frustrations, my resentment toward certain things have really torn a hole in my soul. I've reached a better understanding, a better direction I am now walking in. No longer will I delve into the oceans of sorrow and swim the river of contempt. I'm a shining piece of sterling silver....tarnished and scraped. My wings have been butchered, my halo turned askew. But my essence, my soul, my spirit, my ""I"" has remained the same. Matter can not be created nor destroyed. This love has not been destroyed, this love is here.....in the pits of my endless well.

I'm looking forward to Sweden next week, hopefully that goes well! I NEED TO STOP BEING SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, and get out there and get a job, internship, something related to my major. Erica, you know what i'm talking about. that discussion we had in your car the other day really opened me up more. These things just don't fall on our laps, we must take the initiative and get out there and do this shit for ourselves. No one cares about us, its survival of the fittest in this dog eat dog world. There's so much going on i know, you are such a strong person with out even knowing and believing it. I love you to death and everything will be fine with time trust me sweetheart, i will never let you fall. Thats the wonder of life ya know? we go through tough things, and at times it seems as if there is no end in sight, life won't let you down it just can't. I'm sitting here with the fan hitting me but it's just making me hotter ehhhh. I'm starting to get my inspiration back somehow and it feels good. I was driving to go get some food and i got the chills out of no where, i mean the CHILLS in this 120 degree heat wtf is that? lol but it was a good chill, a chill of hope and inspiriation. I can't really put a finger on it but it was a fairly content feeling. I remember saying I had a feeling that something huge is going to happen this year, i still stand by that. I do feel something big is going to happen I just don't know what it is, good or bad? essential? most likely. We'll see, I'm hot, humid, but not frustrated like yesterday. Yesterday I felt like i was in Hell, it was bad. Fuck global warming, and fuck all you who don't realize it and are aware of the effects it has. Al Gore opened my eyes on that ;) Go see ""An inconceivable truth"" its a great documentary, and spread the word!!"

Our lives do have little purpose. Until a god gives us a 'meaning of life', which I presume could only be a philosophy, as, if our lives had true meaning, we wouldn't be asking a fake creation figure what the meaning was would we? When I was young (like a toddling dribbling oath - About 6 lol ) A teacher asked us what the meaning of life was, and my ignorant mind said ""To have as much fun as possible while we can"". I think it takes a blissfully ignorant 6 year old to be able to see that. Problem is, not many of us are having fun, are we? Humans have made too many systems, and rules. I really want to become a minstrelle, so I can live by the simple ""Have fun"" Philosophy. Perhaps if you asked a god our meaning he'd say ""You ungrateful cunts. You have souls and eyes and mouths and thumbs and cocks and the power to create art and practicalities, and yet you still stand before me confused as to your purpose in existence. As the most capable and complex organism in the galaxy you should realise it's to just chill the fuck out, kick the fuck back and enjoy the powers you have. Of course now you can't because everythings been fucked up, you've all created systems that imprison you, or as unequals, have to climb a social ladder before you can forfill the only goal you have. Savour the taste of life, be good to your family and just be yourself!""

"event","What a misunderstood album. Simple? Ha. Less complex than past Meshuggah albums? Um, no.

_Nothing_ is full of illusion. Things are not as they appear. Here, you will find rhythmic techniques never before applied to metal -- ideas likely to be seen in Indian classical music and African music, yes...not metal. For Meshuggah, the Rhythm is an entity on its own. The musicians are an extension of the rhythm. One must study the rhythms to see the light.

People complain that _Nothing_ is very slow. This is largely true, but maybe even Meshuggah would find it tough to play this music any faster. The rhythmic techniques implemented here are much easier to play at a slower tempo, and they are easier to hear for that matter. ""Nebulous"" is an slightly different example -- it's SLOW in quarter-note 45 bpm. And it is exactly for its dearth of speed that I figure it would be extremely challenging to play live. The polyrhythm is extra twisted at this laggard speed -- these drum parts are very tricky precisely because they are so slow.

_Nothing_'s music warps the mind. Rhythmic chimeras distort one's perception and confuse, until one deciphers the real technique involved. In many cases, Meshuggah makes groups of sixteenth notes sound like quarter-note triplets, and the feats they accomplish with this is remarkable. Apparent changes in meter are actually the same time signature. Sometimes a ""new"" riff appears when actually it is the same group of sixteenth notes. 

Following the 16-beat cycle sometimes makes it easier to see what is happening. ""Straws Pulled at Random"" is a good example of this. The last riff of this song (you hear it before the solo at the end) is SO sick. While it sounds like it is based on subdivisions of quarter-note triplets, this is not actually the case. This creates a very strange effect, since these imaginary triplets are slower than real quarter-note triplets should be. Psychoacoustically speaking, this makes the riff sound like it is lagging behind until it comes together with the 16-beat cycle (it adds to 64 sixteenths, which equals 16 quarter notes). I was really confused about how this worked until I broke it all down. Very interesting stuff.

Another good example is ""Nebulous"", which I mentioned above. There is a riff that comes in at 1:58 that is very confusing. The riff (which presumably breaks down in short sets of eighth notes) doesn't fit with the 16-beat cycle, so the progression which *seems* obvious must logically be incorrect. The actual progression (in sixteenths notes) I can't quite figure out yet, but interestingly -- 20 seconds later -- the next riff kicks in and it appears to use the same primary units of sixteenth notes grouped in 3s -- 8(3+3+3+3+3)+(3+3+2) (in sixteenth notes). However, it sounds like a completely different riff.

Other people complain about a lack of structure on this album, and sometimes with Meshuggah's music in general. The songs are difficult and strange to a new listener, but to claim they have a lack of structure is just false. Plus, the structures are often very inventive and clever. ""Closed Eye Visual"" is one of my favorite songs on this album. The main riff's permutations of the phrase in relation to the 16-beat cycle is stunning. Even more interesting, one probably knows that Meshuggah had a knack for creating the illusion of playing in odd-times when they were not actually doing so. In ""Closed Eye Visual"", they expand this concept to other areas. During the soft part, as Fredrik plays a repetitive texture, the counter melody on the second guitar is derived from earlier measures (during the guitar solo, I'm quite certain). This is quite ingenious, in my opinion, because it makes one think that there has been a big change in the song when in fact the same musical elements are being applied. 

The REAMS AND REAMS of complexity in this album has made it not only my favorite Meshuggah album, but also one of my favorite albums ever. In fact, this album has inspired me to get back into studying rhythmic technique, because I can't live without understanding this more fully. While others wanted faster, more overtly technical songs, I value _Nothing_ for its deeper evolution."

No one really seemed to be in the mood, I didn't talk to anyone really and no one really talked to me. I was just there, but it wasn't horrible. Today I saw Erica for an hour and gave her, her gifts. She got me a sharp black collard shirt, like what i've been wanting to get I really like it, and some ""black"" soap which was really funny lol. I feel good about what I did, because it came staright from my love filled heart, never mind the actual gifts themselves. They are just a representaion of my inner feelings for her. So much in me. Afterwards, I went to my dads place for my dads side and it was alright. I really enjoyed seeing my baby cousin, he's awesome and he really likes me, which makes me feel good. Food was good, but that just adds to my fat. Then I came home and here I am doing nothing, alone. Even though I was with people this weekend, I still felt alone, and still do. I envy my baby cousin, he is so carefree, hyper and happy, all without a care in the world. Being two years old is great, I've never seen a living thing as happy as he was today. I hope you all had a great holiday and got what you wanted. I got some cool things including an ipod. But I never was too fond of material possessions, they really don't mean much. There is only one thing I truly honestly want, and it is not a material item, it has to do with the heart. Just gotta keep the faith and NEVER give up. It's all about perserverance and love. Love conquers all. The new year is almost here, hope its a good one for you, for me, and everyone. Take care."

"event","This isn't biggie and tupac. We're different. Metal has long been a creative release of energy, be it fun, be it scared, violent, upset, what have you. Its a form of expression that most people just don't understand. its NOT for EVERYONE. We take our music and philosophies VERY seriously.

But its not evil - and its not satanic or any of that other horseshit. Metal makes some of us who we are. it identifies us. I personally feel that many of us of the metal fandom are some of brightest and smartest people that i know. People like us that are individuals that don't buy into every last thing, have a really good sense of humor usually and deep down are generally good people. Metal people have the best personalities on this planet.

My teacher doesn't test us on the stuff she covers in class, which is fucking stupid....oh well. Better luck next time ya know? I should take winter session somewhere, but I need a break. For sure im taking summer classes though. I need to, can't afford to fall behind. Other than that, things are okay I guess. My headaches haven't gone away completely but they have been diminishing, so thats good. Well, hope you all are doing well.

"event","Life really isn't fulfilling without challenges. I think we are all brought here on this planet to prove our worth to the cosmos. As we are just a speck of sand in time. A life without turmoil, without dissolution, without worries, without responsibilities would be a bore. We must leave our mark, make our points, and clear these hurdles we encounter. Of course the ultimate goal is to be happy and make happy, but this can not happen without a fight. I think a middle class working person has a more fulfilling and pleasureable life just barely making ends meet, and having just enough to survive and appreciating the feats they accomplished and the rewards earned for the struggle, than an upperclass person who has really nothing to work for, nothing to look forward to, no tough challenges, no fight, everything just handed to them on a silver platter. No matter what we must be brave enough to stand up to these challenges and most of all stand up to ourselves. Terrible pain eventually turns to happiness with time, thats why we must fight this fight. We can't let ourselves remain stagnant and be left to rot in the sun. Life's greatest rewards must be earned and valued to the greatest extent. Don't go quietly into the night.

...I am not one to play with feelings or emotions. I've never been like that, as my feelings have been fucked with in the past so I know how that feeling feels. Any feeling I have is out of sheer honesty. I don't lie about the way I feel for someone. I want to be taken seriously, because I am a very serious person. I do have alot on my mind, I think about everything. I do get sad, and depressed (alot actually) I do cry, I do laugh, I do smile, I do frown, I do get angry, I do apologize. But most of all, I do care..."

"event","I hate when I am alone. Just makes me sulk here and makes my mind start up. I don't even know what to think, what to say. My mind is so active, yet so inactive it's amazing. I think alot. At night I listen to the sound of the animals. I understand now that there are no limits to what you are capable of. You don't even see it yourselves, and the news anchor on the TV set talks in a neutral voice about rape, murder, and this weeks weather without change of tone. It seems that nothing matters in this world of ignorance, greed, and manipulation. Violence and commercial breaks have become the opium that used to be religion. Whatever happened to beauty, love, and compassion? Maybe I am delusional, but that is what matters to me. Sure, I may listen to blasphemous, angry, hateful, gory, and negative music. My writing may be the same at times. But that is not what I am. Not at all. I am the ultimate contradiction to all of that. I delve deep in my soul at night, and I know what is important to me. Not material possessions, not getting good grades(although important to my future), not my appearance, not the TV, not the computer, not any perks or hobbies of mine, that stuff is all trivial, means nothing to me, to my soul. What is important to me? Love, compassion, caring, thoughtfulness, awarness, acknowledgement, clarity of thought, satisfaction. I know you will probably say that this is what is important to everybody. But thats not true. Take a look around, take a look at the world. This world burns. This world only cares about appearance, money, and material possessions. What's the point of life, living by those rules? How does one keep sane? For me, it's in a poem, a book, a song, a thought, a person, a moral, a smile. 

Alot on my mind. what to do, what to say? Confusion clouds my mind, but I know what I want. After the rain, I told that rainbow what I wanted. I wished for my desire. Will it lead me to the pot of gold? To my happiness? I hope the fog on that freeway is cleared, so things may be clear and destinations may be reached, without much turbulance.

"event","In the dawn an angel was dancing
sorrounded by an aura of light
But in the shadows something was watching
and with patience awaiting the night
Angel whispers: ""Mournful night, attractive night,
your dark beauty obsesses me""
An angel bewitched by the shadows
Seduced by the whispering lies

A spell was cast an the sky turned red
The angel's heart froze to ice
The blackness that falls is coming to stay
Under the snow lies angels so cold

Dusk has passed and a cold morning breeze,
is sweeping all over the plain,
On the ground lies an angel with skin so pale,
On her face an image of pain,
Snow is now falling to the frozen ground,
The angel is covered by white,
Frost is spreading across the plain,
to welcome the eternal night.

The dress is white with crystals of ice
and frozen roses so red
Roses of blood from an innocent soul
On the plain lies an angel dead"

2 midterms over and done with, R S 100 (ehh! don't know about this one) and History, I think I did fairly okay on it. Much better than I anticipated. Same with Erica, I guess that studying paid off huh? :D (well, hopefully)

Got a new phone!!! yay!! It's an LG VX 7000. It's pretty cool, better than my old one, which would die every damn 2 hours. Now i'm just sitting here playing around with it, taking pix of everything. 

Saving up for a lap top, and drums. 

Started writing again, it hasn't been too long since i've written but between school, work, and midterms there hasn't been much time to appease my passion. Been inspired alot, by Mr. Doctor(the genius behind ""Devil Doll"") the guy is brilliant, crazy, but brilliant.

Wild flower in starlit heaven
Still enchanted in flight
Obsessions lament to freedom

A timeless word, the meanings changed
But I'm still burning in your flames,
Incessant, lustral masquerade,
Unengaged, dimlit love didn't taste the same

And I still wonder if you ever wonder the same
And I still wonder...""

Life is like a mystery, with many clues, but with few anwers to tell us what it is that we can do to look for messages that keep us from the truth. From rivers of sorrow, to oceans deep with hope, I have travelled them. If I was paid for disappointments I would be a wealthy man. The magic lives in sincerity, in truth, behind the thoughts I choose to stand...Awaiting discovery."

Speak to me
For I have seen
Your waning smile
Your scars concealed
So far from home, do you know you're not alone
Sleep tonight
Sweet summer light
Scattered yesterdays, the past is far away

How fast time passed by
The transience of life

Wasted moments won't return
And we will never feel again

Beyond my dreams
Ever with me
You flash before my eyes, a final fading sigh
But the sun will rise
And tears will dry
Of all that is to come, the dream has just begun

And time is speeding by
The transience of life

Wasted moments wont return
And we will never feel again

I long for you..........."

"event","Since the day I met you I could tell you were a unique and quite a wonderful person. And every moment that I am with you just reaffirms those beliefs. I really hope you do believe me when I say that you are truly everything that I've ever wanted. I know I've told you this before but I say it because it is true, as you know I never say anything without meaning it. And yeah I know you have many emotions built up inside of you and I know it's hard to come out of that shell and open up, trust me I know I've been there before myself. The past has been tough for you I know, and yeah it's hard to ignore the past and live life in the present. But in reality that is the best thing to do, hold on to your past only for guidance and remembrence and to know that the past was real. But it is not good at all to base what you do, what you feel, and how you think in the present according to your past. Everyone has demons from the past, that's just normal. As human beings, we make mistakes and do things at one point or another that we regret later in life, that's just natural. You can't blame yourself,or hold back feelings because of what has happened before. I think the best way to live life is by trial and error, such a simple concept but effective. If things don't go right then keep trying and trying till you do get them right, because they WILL go right for you eventually, that is inevitable, in the end everything evens out, for every bad moment there is a good moment, even if that may not seem to be the case at the time.

I know you are confused about alot of things right now. The best thing to do in my opinion, is to have faith in yourself, listen to your feelings, listen to your heart, even if you think you don't know anything and things are in a bind and confusing, just listen to yourself. Like i've said before, your heart and intuition are more effective than the brain. The brain has soo many thoughts and impulses, that they make everything jumbled and unclear. But your heart is pure, it will always be pure, listen to it and you shall find your answers, walls will be broken down, the rain will go away, and the sun may shine for you once again. Don't be afraid to open up though, nothing bad can come from it. You should always say what you feel, and be honest with those you care about, It's true honesty is always the best policy. I've learned the hard way. No matter what you think may happen in a situation always be honest, in the end it works out the best that way. Never run from problems, face them head on.

I care for you sooo incredibly much. I never want to see you sad and hurt, but I WILL be there for you no matter what the case is. I like everything about you, yes EVERYTHING. We all have our faults, no one is perfect, I want to pick you up when you feel down, I want to make you smile when you frown, I want to make you feel special, because well.....you are special, very specialy to me especially, I want to make you feel warm when you are cold, I want to make you feel loved, because I have Alot of love inside my heart, I want to make you feel like you can be yourself at all times, anywhere because YOU are such a WONDERFUL person, and finally.....I just want YOU.

Love,
Jeff"

"event","If my life could be summed up in a shape, it would definatly be a circle. A circle just goes round and round, and basically that's how my life has been up to this point. Especially in one particular area of my life that never seems to go my way ever. I'm hoping for that to change, really am. I hate this feeling of being put down, let down, and not knowing whats in store.

By Lacuna Coil:


What is it for?
What is sacred?
In my circle of regrets
circle of regrets

today I'm drawing circles
in my memory, in the pages of my life

That's me for a long time
I can't run away... (long time)

These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
my regrets (I don't want this feeling)

I need more
all I want is to break
my circle of regrets
circle of regrets

Is there any solution?
I want to find the way to escape... to go away"

Sebastian, a good friend of mine, and me went to see Die Krupps in Berlin last night. Although the support acts weren't that special, the whole evening was awesome. Particularly Die Krupps rocked the house. They played all kinds of old songs like ""Volle Kraft voraus"",""Goldfinger"",""To the Hilt"" and my all-time favorite ""Machineries of Joy"". Juergen Engler seemed to enjoy the closeness to the fans and often touched hands. Besides, you could see he had fun on stage playing all the great songs and the two encores really made the show an evening worth the long driving. The crowd was quite cool and the ""25 Jahre Wahre Arbeit Wahrer Lohn"" Tour is really something I would recommend to anyone who likes good old electronic music

In addition, you were able to purchase the limited cd with the new version of ""Machineries of Joy"" Douglas had told me about. He sings in German ""Arbeit, Lohn"" which is really fun to hear. Oh man, how much I love that song.
Besides, some musicians crossed my way and you were able to see Erk from Hocico and Eskil from Covenant. I got a little talk to Erk as we always meet at shows around Europe. Unfortunately, they won't do any shows this year in Europe, but I'm sure we will see him running around at WGT- as always...

What a nice start into this day. But now i'm off to get ready and meet my colleagues at work in order to bring them some cake ;)"

<b>The last weekend...</b>
Friday night was the best night ever: I still cannot find any words for that, but I guess I had the opportunity to pass one of the bestest nights in my life so far.
We went to see Fixmer/McCarthy plus some supporting bands at the Starclub in Dresden. The show was great and I danced quite a lot right in front of the stage so that my shirt was soaking wet<img src='http://www.smilies-world.de/smilies/smilies_Picture/party_smilies/2.gif' border='0' alt='comes with ByteThumb  V 1.4 &copy; Byteandi'> Unfortunately, they only had one encore...but still: I loved the Nitzer Ebb songs they played. It was really awesome!!!
BUT...As I was waiting for a friend of mine to come out of the hall, first Terence Fixmer came out of the back stage room, then suddenly, there was <b>DOUGLAS McCARTHY !!!</b>
Uhh,and there was another old friend of mine who came up.We haven't seen each other for more than 6 years or so...and he introduced me to the two guys.
They actually wanted to go to a strip club, but then decided to go get drunk and take me with them to their hotel<img src='http://www.smilies-world.de/smilies/smilies_Picture/essen___trinken/21.gif' border='0' alt='comes with ByteThumb  V 1.4 &copy; Byteandi'>
loooollll that was more than just crazy<img src='http://www.smilies-world.de/smilies/smilies_Picture/sonstige/daumen_2.gif' border='0' alt='comes with ByteThumb  V 1.4 &copy; Byteandi'>[...]
<img src='http://www.smilies-world.de/smilies/smilies_Picture/sonstige/hail_01.gif' border='0' alt='comes with ByteThumb  V 1.4 &copy; Byteandi'>
Breakfast was fun and I was very hungover when I had to walk back to the tram station around 11 in the morning.

Saturday and Sunday were just regular party events, some EBM parties in Dresden...some dancing...some talking and quite a few drinks

Yesterday was a blast. Finally got to see the cure again, this time playing at the Wuhlheide in Berlin, an awesome open air arena :) lots of international people, a great atmosphere and a set of almost three hours playing mostly old stuff.

And I'm surprised I survived that weekend so well as the others I partyed with on Saturday night made me feel so hungover on Sunday. Never again Whiskey-Coke...
Result:
Altmark-Electros = weirdos (when it comes to drinking habits) *gg*

"event","Ahhh, the week started very strange: Mr Collapse has a new girlfriend. And I really like her, so I hope he won't treat her the way he treated me and all the girls before.
Susi and me made a bet, saying that it most likely will only last about one month until he gets sick of her... Will see...I'm excited to see how it goes...

I went out to see Interpol on Tuesday night. It seems as if that was one of the only two gigs in Germany (besides Stuttgart) and I am happy that they hit Dresden. It was really gorgeous and I enjoyed the great voice of the singer together with the wonderful music as well as the pretty bass player..hmmm.... 
I took about 20 pictures with my old camera, so I'll see soon if they turned out well or not.

Today I'm just done with an exam, and in about one hour, I'll be sitting in my German class to hold a presentation. How interesting can auxiliaries be???
Ahh,I'll make three crosses when I come back tonight.

Then, the weekend is ahead and I can finally relax and look forward to go to the Vancouver-Party at the Bunker on Saturday. Old school EBM...=)

I'm hungover and totally wrecked. My throat is killing me as camping in the cold and with lots of rain is no fun after 6 days...ahhh....and I feel like stones have hit my head.

Nevertheless, I saw some really good concerts and met several nice people. Some I missed (I'm sorry,maybe we all got lost in the crowd?) and others I danced all night with...
yay... for example, until 7 this morning at the Moritzbastei: http://www.globalnoisemovement.com

Regarding bands that I luckily haven't missed, there were:
Apoptygma Berzerk, Krupps
Spetsnaz, Hocico
MS Gentur, Mono no Aware, Xotox, Kiew, Dive... (a great day at Werk 2; Unfortunately, I was pretty much all by myself as none of the others was able to get in anymore...)

Plus,met the guy from aesthetic perfection....very drunk...
and saw some ""pieces"" from welle erdball yesterday...
 
In case I find the pics on the web, I'll post them...
Right now,I'm tired and will just head for my bed and try to get rid of my cold.

They said that they really enjoyed the gig as the crowd apparently had gone crazy. At some points during the concert, you could swear that the security fence was about to fall apart...Then, they actually thought that their keyboards had broken down...
That's Dresden live, I guess!
Then we hung out in the catering room and had lots of fun listening to older stories.

I know it sounds rather hilarious, but I took part in some competition a while ago hoping to win tickets for the GREEN DAY concert in Berlin next week. Today I received an email from MTV telling me that I might get picked but they also asked me to send a picture first *g*
So I sent some from my last trip to berlin, being all dressed up with teased hair and stuff. I really wonder if they pick me, but if they do, it would be really cool.
They said that they are looking for a mixed crowd. So let's see whether they have enough punk/goth kids or if I'm still of interest to them after having sent these pictures...

I went back and read a lot of the old entries (well at least the last 20) and it's interesting to see how much things change...the way that I think about people and even just how different life was last year. I miss it. I mean, I dont wanna go back to how things used to be cause at some degree i've taken a step forward, grown up a little. or at least i'd like to think so. and well, going back would be like taking a step backwards in life. 

I just think that it's amazing to observe how fast and drastically things can change. 

anyways, i've had a good day. pretty laid back and relaxing. I've been listening to great music all day long and studio class went okay. 

I had a nice talk with my mom about next year and even beyond that. I feel like my mind is in a constant debate with itself 24/7 ""cranbrook or interlochen"". Its just so hard cause i have many valid reasons to choose both of them. And for some reason this feels like a huge decision...like if i stay here i'm signing myself away to the wolves and putting myself on a path towards one life, but then if i go to cranbrook i'll be signing myself to a different life, one where I have to give up everything that i've grown up loving and dreaming about. There are sometimes when I just want to throw in the towel and never sing another note in my life, but then there are times when it feel so right. I get goosebumps and my hair on the back of my neck stands up. It's such a rush then and deep down i know that it's right...i'm home on stage. 

I feel like if i perform then I wont be able to settle down...but if I settle down then i'll always wonder ""what if?"" and when I hear about these amazing people, that i'm going to school with now, making it big out there i'll be jealous...cause i could have had a shot at that. I feel like i owe it to myself to try...but I dont want to waste my time. 

grrrrrr

i hate making decisions. i wish that there was someone that had all of the answers. 

oh well...i dont have to decide today. 
I can just sit here listening to good music and watching the lights on my christmas tree blink on and off. hmmm i should prolly write some x-mas cards. 

9 days!"

so i might get rid of this one. and just so u know my new one is i_could_fall

fun stuff. school's ok. not having the time of my life or anything, but i'm not dying either, so i guess i can't complain. so um, check the other journal...that's the one that i usually post in.

"event","today is a great day. i've been very productive too! I scheduled all those ucky dr.'s appts that i need to go to school and signed up for seg.2 driver's ed. uh...lots and lots of chores...and wait for it....i warmed up to a high A today! a whole note higher than ever before! ahhh...but lets just see if i can still get it tomorrow. 

talked to my dad this morning. he can't come take me to dinner tonight, which means that i'm still broke for a  few more days. He bought a  new boat for the lake. A little whaler. we used to have a larger whaler, but no one ever drove it. and i never drove it cause dad and we usually got into fights when he was teaching me how. 

anyways, he kept on telling me about this new boat and how he got a smaller one thats much easier to drive. and he bought me new lifejackets. like everytime i talked to him on the phone he brought it up. it kinda annoying after a  while. I was like ""why do i need to worry about driving a boat when i have to worry about parallel parking ur bus of a vehicle?"" 

now i just found out from dara that he told her he had bought the boat for me to try and convince me to come down to the house for a few weeks this summer. at first i thought he was a jerk for trying to bribe me to spend time with him, but then i remembered what i had told him the last time i was there like 2 weeks ago.

I told him that being on the boat was summer for me. because it always makes me feel calm and peaceful just being able to cruise around the lake and see kids swimming and the sail boat races. it's where i spent my summers growing up, so I dont really feel like it's summer until i'm there by the lake. I told him how i missed the view of it all, and how you dont have to speak in order to talk when ur on the lake. everything's just kinda understood.  I could tell by his face when i was telling him all of this that he really took it to heart. so when you think about it...he did a really sweet thing, buying me a boat. so i can go out on it whenever i want and have that alone time to just think. and buying a boat is not inexpensive. i'm just surprised he did it so fast, when the summer's already half gone. mmm i love my daddy. he's given me sooo much. voice lessons, an excellent education, boats lol, lots and lots of ""we need to have a talk"" talks, lots of hugs, a new bathroom with awesome acoustics so i can sing to my heart's content, and well, as long as I work hard to his standards I have the world at my feet. and let's not forget that he gave me a huge family! now when I tell my mom she's my favorite mom, it's really saying somethin! lol 

anyways, i'd better go...my mom's takin me to look at glasses...i lost mine! ahhhh

love you all
mwah!

"event","today's theme : DONT LET MEL SLEEP!!!

since i've had a fucked up sleeping schedule lately I had thisw crazy idea that I wouldn't sleep last night and I'd stay up all day, then go to bed early. so...here i am...still haven't slept. counting down the hours until i can let myself doze off. but man, todaqy has been crazy. I stayed up all night reading...then I went outisde and layed curled up in the hammock with a  blanket and watched the sun come up. it was really peaceful at first, with the birds chirpping and having all that time to myself, but when i started to get really tired i wanted to shoot myself for such a stupid idea. eventually i couldn't read the book anymore cause my eyes got all blurry and such. but, obviously i pulled through. 

i got my josh groban tix in the mail today!! ten days until the concert!! woohoo...plus that means i get to see the campus again before i go to school, and i can hopefully meet helena for the first time. really nervous tho. 

uh yea...i've actually been really cranky today. i've decided that no sleep without adrenaline (sp?) to keep u going the next day is worse than pms. or maybe i'm just cranky cause meg didn't work today, so i didn't get a break from her at all. 

mmmmmm i really wanna close my eyes, but i have a feeling that my mom will jump out from the shadows and catch me. she wont leave the house without me with her cause she's afraid that i'll go to sleep and screw it up. but bed sounds good...nice warm blankets and a fan running. *sigh* only like 3 hours left...

goodnight, sleep tight
no more tears
in the morning
i'll be here

and when we say goodnight
dry your eyes
because we said goodnight
and not goodbye

we said goodnight
and not goodbye."

"event","Another uneventful day...

tried to play some josh groban songs on the horribly out of tune piano, but with my lack of piano skills it was just one big mess. 

my mom got home and we had chinese for dinner. the chinese resaurant by my house is so yummy, and there is this little old short chinese guy...he's so cute. you walk in the door and he always has this huge smile on his face and then he bows and takes you to your table. cutest little old guy in the world, i swear. 

anyways, eventually my mom said somethin about her not having to go to work tomorrow. and i asked why. she looked at me like i was dumb and said ""i never work on the weekends"" now that one sent me for a trip, cause i was convinced it was somewhere around like wed. night. now, during the school year this whole weekend surprise would not have been a problem at all. however in the summer there is the little thing called dad's house. I hadn't made any official plans to meet up with my dad yet, and this weekend i really wanna do things with my friends. 

So i tried to call my dad's cell phone, only to remember that a week ago a very drunk mr. east threw it into the lake. so no more cell phone. and unfortunately I dont know his new number. called his house to talk to Julie and ask her, only to find out that his new one isn't workin right. and that he was out with customers all night. so...no dad's house for me. but i'm thinkin that i can get him to come up here to the big G.R. for dinner or something. besides, i need more money. 

I got some from him the last time i went to his house with ashley, but i spent it all on books. now that is going down in history. i never thought i would ever say that! ahhhh! and now..i want more money...for more books. its funny how when i was required to read over the summer, I never did. I always hated the books we were assigned and if i went to read somethin else i would always feel guilty cause i hadn't done my hw yet! so now, i'm like a bookaholic. 

yea ok...i'm gonna go take hunter for a walk. 
luv ya!

"event","ok so things have simmered down a little. My mom and I went to Barnes and Noble and i bought another book (what a surprise!). I think i've prolly spent at least $200 on books so far this summer. anyways, we sat in the cafe and just talked for a good two hours. She helped me understand meg a little better. and we just talked about random stuff. 
   we talked about names and she was wonderin what i might name my kids when i'm ""much older"" as she put it. anyways, the conversation eventually led to me asking her if I got my middle name from my great-grandmother. we call her grandma jo, which is short for josephine. anyways, I had always joked about me having the same name as my dad's high school prom date, but I was sure that it was from my Grandma b/c surely my parents wouldn't name me after some fling my dad had...but it turns out, it was the prom date! I thought it was just a funny story, but geez...
  people usually say ""yea, I was named after my dad"" or ""this name has been in my family forever"" the only thing i can say is ""hi, i'm named after my dad's prom date."" i mean seriously...doesn't that make you wonder how significant that night was to make my dad remember to name his daughter after her? maybe i should take another look at my birth certificate! ha! jk. i already did, and my mom really is my mom. I guess I should be kinda happy that i'm not named after my great-grandma cause i really can't stand her. She has no filter in her head, she says whatever she wants to. and she never has anything nice to say let me tell you. Now i kinda do wanna meet who i'm named after. 
   She might be questionable. afterall my dad was a trouble maker when he was in high school...my grandma tells me all of the stories about him. Like how he fit like 200 people in his house on night for a party (a very tiny house), and how people would come from out of town to go to his parties. and let's not forget the time that i read all his old yearbooks. every single person that signed said somethin along the lines of ""hey billy, next time you wanna skip class count me out! i've gotten caught too many times!"" or ""Bill, nice parties man!"" or ""hi billy, will you go out with me!?!?"" 
   now i know why my dad is so strict with us, cause he doesn't want us to be like him! hahahaha! oh well...it is kinda weird tho, to think that my dad was a popular jock. i'm ashamed. lol jk
   I really do love my daddy, who else would drive two hours to bring me strawberries and flowers and take me out to lunch in the middle of the school day?! anyways, i must go...i only have a limited amout of time before meg takes over the phone line again! luv you all!

"event","tonight is night number...ummm nvm I lost count...well we'll just say that it's night number a lot that I've stayed up into the wee hours of the morning...my mom will be getting up for work in like an hour. I just can't sleep for some reason...i've been reading a lot to make myself tired, but then even when I am tired, my brain just wont shut up. which is kinda weird for a blonde cause usually a blonde's brain doesn't do anything. but that still leaves me awake at 4 in the morning. 

people (or maybe it's just me) think of some really weird things when they are sleep deprived. like tonight...i was reading this fan site in french. and it said that Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) has been rumored to be dating a girl named Melissa...me being in my mental state at 4:00 am thought...""hey wouldn't it be funny if i was dating him and I didn't even know it?!?!"" now the problem with this is that...ha it would never happen. but he is british *sigh* there's somethin about boys with accents. 

come to think of it...I dont think it's just me that gets weird late at night. Voodoo does too, cause when we were playing apples to apples or studying, one of the two, she was convinced that she was retarded becuase her mom gave birth to her when she was 36...that's not even possible. and well, she also started singng the sound of music one time, but instead of the hills being alive with the sound of music they were alive with dirty underwear. 

I think many of my greater blonde moments have happened late at night, for instance...one time I tried to convince julia that I could multi-task. not only could I pat my head and rub my stomach, but I could walk and talk at the same time, and breathe and talk at the same time as well...but then while I was tryin to figure out why she was laughing at me, I occurred to me that no one can breath and talk at the same time. hey, even if I am turning into Jessica Simpson, at least I'll still be able to have a go at a singing career...and not a bad looking hubby either. although nick doesn't have a sexy british accent. i'd be better off with the magical asshole that i'm dating without my knowledge. 


mmmm then there are the people who are really weird while they are sleeping. Once when I was stayin up to finish a paper that I had procrastinated writing until the night before the due date, I looked over when I heard Julia sit up in bed. I went to ask her a question but she didn't answer. and then I saw that she had her hand up to her ear like she was holding a cell phone, and she was talkin to thin air. it didn't stop there tho, after like 30 seconds of talkin to this ""person"" she stopped mid-sentence, brought her hand down and looked at it as if she was looking at the phone, then brought it back and said "" wait ur cutting out....can you hear me now?....i'll call you later!!!"" then she hung up and laid back down...like 3 seconds later she woke up cause I was laughing so hard...but really...i mean...wow. only julia would have a cell phone conversation in her sleep. 

hmmmm...well...i'm tired of typing, i'm gonna go read some more and wait for my famous nonexistent boyfriend to call me. hahahahaha....okay, it really shouldn't be that funny to me. *sigh* it's not the same being hyper without CK people to be stupid with me. *tear*

gnight...or goodmorning really.

"event","i'm going to the josh groban concert at interlochen on July 20th!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wooohoooo!!!!!!!!

my mom and i are going to drive up in the morning to explore the campus so i dont look like an idiot and get lost on my first day of school! hehe, then the concert is at 8pm. then we drive home after the concert, I can't wait! 

my dad pulled the ""no interlochen!"" fight again this weekend, but I won...so dont fret, i'm still going. 

he made me mad this weekend. Cause he's been begging me to come see him, and when i finally do he's not even there most of the time. the first night i was there, right when he got home from work he had a work party to go to. then the next morning he was golfing. when he came back he had to prepare for all of his friends to come over for dinner and drinks which went from 6 pm- 1:30 am. So that was friday and saturday, I had asked him to free up sunday so I could actually spend time with him. So i woke up early on sunday morning so we could like talk and then go on the lake later,but he was already gone...where you ask?  golfing with the same group of guys that had come for dinner the night before. ugh...he makes me furious. so the only time i do get to spend time with him this weekend he wants to ""have a talk"". so we ended up fighting about interlochen. I swear he only  gives me awesome opportunities just so he can have somethin to take away when he gets mad at me. hmph. anyways, that's my dad. 

my mom and I had a good talk today. somethin that we haven't done in a while, so that was really nice. and I bought some new Cd's and I've been paintin a lot when I can't sleep. It's very relaxing and lets me think about things clearly when my brain wont shut up. 

mmmm josh groban's voice is amazing...puts me in a good mood.  *sigh* i love music. I love having something that I can be passionate about that I know will always be there. Music makes me feel the most powerful emotions...
ANYWAYS...i'm  done i swear. 

I talked to Jessie and ReAnne the other day. I miss them sooooo much!!! i'll have to have them come visit. 

dinner time, catcha later

So if I dont get better by tomorrow evening there will be no concert for me, which makes me really mad. I've been looking forward to it. 

Today I was so bored that I made myself a scrapbook of all the lovely memories I made at CK. I'm happy though that I haven't missed it yet. Dont get me wrong I love you all to death, but I haven't had trouble moving on, cause i know we all had good times. 

I saw a pic of Edward with his combover. hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!! it was very amusing. 

I had a horrible dream last night. I've had it before, but I hadn't gotten it since the summer before freshman year... anyways I pretty much just get cancer and die, but it's very scary cause there's much more stuff involved that I can't really explain. looong story. 

so my dad wants us all to go out to NY as a family to visit Dara, but I was kinda hoping it would be just Dar, meg, and me. 

Meg and I are goin to Florida Aug 21st i think.

I have the house to myself allll day long tomorrow...whatever will i do?!?!? eh, prolly just call ashley and go out or somethin. I kinda feel bad for not contacting more of my friends here yet. I still have to call bart, james, jason, laurie, mary, kelsey, mandy, amber, and too many other people. haven't really talked to cranbrook people at all either, but i'm havin fun with ash, rick, and eric. 


i'm watchin Rosanne on TV, funny show. used to watch it all the time. Ever since i left for Cranbrook I dont really watch much TV, but i have the essentials. like the golden girls. best show ever!!!!

I'm already getting feasted upon by little vampires we like to call mosquitoes. grrr...and i'm mildly allergic so it really sucks. I had to tie my hands together last night so i didn't scratch them and make em worse. Even so i'm still getting big welts...i think the biggest one i have is now...1.5 inches in diameter. Chicken Pox was easier than this....grrrr...never going outside again!

actually i am because my mom bought another hammock. So at night rick and i always meet out there and talk and shit.  For those of you who dont know, rick is the guy that lives behind me and we've been friends forever. He likes to shine lasers in my bedroom window while i sleep, and set off fire crackers in my backyard. But i still love him. I still haven't seen ashley yet, must fix that. 

Saw harry potter. great movie..must go at least 2 more times. Tom and Daniel have gotten quiet cute..and i loooove accents. So i'm a goner. 

Dara left for New York yesterday with mom, which leaves meg and me alone for a whole week!!! please pray for me. 


Went shopping yesterday with dara before she left. I should prolly warn my dad about it before he sees the credit card bill...yea that would be much better for his health. hehe. 

hmmm...nothin else to say, except it's nice to be home. It's good to see hunter again.

cherry finally signed my yearbook..but i haven't read it yet cause she told me not to...

oooooooo, i had my last bus ride with Harry today, and he went behind by the faculty houses where all the speedbumps are. so hitley, cherry and I went to the way way way back and he went fast over the bumps and we went flying...good memories from like 1st grade lol


said goodbye to mr. winter today, which was sad. *mental note: remember to record somethin for him over the summer and send it* 
he said something really sweet in my yearbook...""your voice has helped lift hearts and souls to the angels..."" which is a direct reference to the little moment we had when i sang at his wife's memorial service...one of the saddest moments of my life. anyways, i'm gonna miss that guy, he was like a dad to me. 

the black lights in the gym for afterglow were pretty awesome. 

finally got a song on cd that i've wanted for like 3 weeks. 

still have yet to pack....will do that tonight while i'm procrastinating studying french. parlez-vous francais? non? voulez-vous coucher avec moi? ahhhh streetcar...some good memories there too, but i must go and so somethin with myself instead of just sit here....

"event","i have officially done nothing today..except read harry potter. I've spent the whole day alone, cause i didn't go to cedar point cause i was supposed to study, which i obviously didn't do anyways....

last night i was campused, so i spent even more time alone. 

I hate this. 

but on a lighter note, only two more exams = only roughy 4 more hours of school left. then i'm done and i only have to sing one more song at graduation and then i'm outa here.

part of me is wonderin if i should even do the whole goin to graduation parties thing...it would kinda screw up the whole goodbye process. cause friday is when i say goodbye to everyone and to everything that is cranbrook. and going to the parties would be like the Lord of the Rings...you think its over and you move on...oh and what do you know!it's not really over, there's like 10 more endings!!!! I just want to say goodbye and move on instead of lingering. 

I know people are telling me that it's not really goodbye... ""we'll still talk"" or ""you'll come visit or we'll visit you!"", but in all honesty I wont come and visit. the only reason i visit my old school back home is cause i have to go there to see family anyways, and those are people i've known my whole life, not just two years. 

eventually even talking online or on the phone will be awkward. we'll run out of things to say cause you all wont know the new people in my life up at interlochen and gradually i will forget about cranbrook, just like i've already started to forget some names at my old school. Once somethin is not in your life everyday it becomes less important, whether you like it or not.  

I'm sorry if this hurts or offends some of you guys, it's not that i dont value your friendship cause really you guys are awesome, more than i could have ever asked for. It's just easier this way and I just wanted to give you a heads up so you aren't suprised when I really do say goodbye, or if our inside jokes aren't as funny anymore, and my responses are shorter online, or when i finally stop returning your calls...

please know that i love you all dearly and that i've truely enjoyed this time with you, but this is a chapter in my life that needs to be closed. It's too painful to look back and wonder what if i'd stayed and how my life would be different. I wish you all happiness...

but now i have to go pack."

"event","so, 1 down 4 to go....tomorrow is the worst of 'em all.

math and history....icky!!!
hah that rhymes...

so...tonight was fun, john is amazing and always will be. I really and starting to get an idea of what saying goodbye is going to be like in a few days. I kept on kidding myself saying that it'll be quicl and easy...the sooner i leave the better. But i'm not ready to move on. At the recital john gave me a hug...and he didn't smell like john (he wasn't wearing his cologne) and it was so weird, but i was so disappointed. Just cause that is what i smell when i think of him...just like when i think of julia i smell Chanel. so when he didn't smell like john today i felt like i lost him, as weird as that sounds. 

and then while he was singing and i just looked around the room and saw Lee and Becka and Ariel and Nick and Cheri, and well, everyone really and all of the support that each and every person gives to one another, i just feel like i'll never be able to find that anymore, ya know? 

so then we went to dinner after and john said somethin weird to me...well no weird but it made me think for the first time in a long time about how people see me. he said that when i look sad that he can't stop looking at me...at first i didn't know how to take that...but now i kinda feel mad at myself about it, cause he said that it was cause i was dramatic and i drew attention to myself...and i dont wanna be dramatic on the outside. I dont want people to be able to read my thoughts so easily. 

I wish that i could stop time and not start it again until i was ready to leave and move on. It goes by too fast when i want it to be slow and it goes too slow when i want it to fly by. 

I can't bring myself to study for exams...i feel like it's the weekend and that on monday at 8:03 i will walk into the choir room late as usual and there will be the mads warming up to get ready for yet another concert... during the year it felt like it would never end, and now that it's about to end it feels like it never should. 

the thing that really sucks is that in another two years i have to do this alll over again, maybe i'll be used to it by then.

ok well, goodluck to everyone on their exams, and i love you all.

I was really excited for the summer but this weekend all hopes of it being cool were crushed when i saw Meg again and I was reminded of why we got along so much better when we were like 1,000 miles away from each other. 

My dog was really cute tho. 

thursday i'm supposed to sing at john's recital...part of me really doesn't want to, but i'm singing a song for my mom so it'll be worth it. she needs to know how much i appreciate her.

ok, so all week,scratch that...all month john has been kinda bitchy cause he's been in character and i really got sick of it, and so did a million other people. But hopefully now that Streetcar is over with I wont have to deal with Stanley anymore. I want John back...

but Streetcar Named Desire was amazing! So fucking hot!!! Steelllllaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!! I love you Cheri!

cast party...hmmmm...so much fun! Scott is one of the funniest people i have ever known. And the fire was fun...singing moulin rouge songs and Happiness. *sigh* i will miss my squishy

ooooo and on the way there lauren and i got lost and so we went to burger king and yea....umm...funny shit happened. By the time we got to the party i was laughing so hard that i fell on the ground. Then talked to Brad for a while. Really sad that i didn't meet him before now cause he's awesome. 

So I tried sleep around 5 am but john was whining in his sleep and cheri was kinda snoring...got sooo close to falling asleep and then a cat jumped on me...scared the shit out of me and i woke up cheri. 

So baccalaureate (sp?) was ok. our songs sucked but Nicks chant was fucking amazing and i now love him for it. I can't believe he's leaving us to go to Romania! stupid vampire!!!
I would have been really bored but i played tetris on Toro's cell phone the whole time. 

Then Mittner's party was fun. Even better when amanda showed up. Charlie Brown danced! I was so proud of him.  

Now, i really need to study. I have....
2 french tests
1 bio test
1 math test
1 history test
1 major english assignment

all due tomorrow!!!!!! ahhhh!

"event","that was the saddest concert ever

so it started out ok, i felt fine, my dad made it...my grandpa wasn't already asleep and life was good. 

then my solo comes and i wasn't even sure if my voice was really working at that point, but it turned out ok i guess. anyways afterwards ms. speck brings me back out and tells everyone about my acceptance into interlochen and how i'm leaving and just gave this really nice speech and it made me sad. 

then amanda's solo...my heart was seriously like twisting and i almost cried..not yet, but almost. 

then salvation came along and Lina was conducting and like a major flashback from last year when naina was up there doing the same thing and it was soooo sad cause i miss naina soooo much...

Movin on...that is one of the prettiest songs that we sing, and right about the time when all of the seniors sing i felt cheri's and alex's grip on my hands just tighten and i looked at both of them and we all started crying at the same time...i looked over at lauren and she was crying and it just kinda went down the line like that...it just kinda hit me hard that this was the last time i would sing my favorite song in my favorite place with some of the best people i've ever met. 

afterwards in the lobby it was just all hugs and tears. Brian (i love you soo much) was crying harder than i was and i really didn't think it was possible...then anna came over and so did cheri and we all just had one big group hug and they were all telling me how i couldn't leave...and for the first time i truely felt like i didn't want to. then john came over and we had once of the most honest conversations ever and then we just danced and he hummed in my ear...i'm gonna miss that guy sooo much. and logan...i can't even put into words how much he really means and how sweet he is. 
then i eventually got around and found my family. my grandma brought me lilly of the valley and they are my fav flower and smell sooo good. and my dad brought me lots and lots of medicine and money..thank god for him...and my mom brought herself and it means sooo much taht she was there. 

wow...if tonight was so hard i wonder what moving out will be like..and singing at graduation...

well in honor of the madrigals and everyone i hold dear to my heart, here are the lyrics for our favorite madgrigal song!

Movin on

there is a voice that has no name
it comes with evening or behind the rain
I have no time now to stop and explain
I just keep movin cause it helps to ease the pain.

the night has music that calls to me
across the canyons of an endless sea.
I seek the shadows of yesterday
today can't hold me and i must be on my way.

speak to me softly but tell me no lies
I see tomorrow shining in your eyes
I have no time now to stop and explain 
I just keep movin cause it helps to ease the pain."

"event","<P>today has to be the weirdest most fun day ever!!! so i woke up and went to go warm up for solo and ensemble only to see strangers here...then i remembered that today was the centennial celebration! </P>
<P>so got ready went outside and found myself at a trolley stop!!?!? and sure enough trolleys were running on campus instead of buses. I personally think that we should have trolleys everyday!</P>
<P>solo and ensemble was fun...i was there for 6 hours and i just talked to john the whole time! :) so then on the way back instead of takin the bus i made a huuuge mistake in riding home with nick. everyone stopped at mcdonald's...and while we were there we started a water gun fight..ended up shooting ms. speck (the hen) on the way out and got completely lost on our way out cause nick decided to stop following the freakin bus!!!</P>
<P>so i'm in the car with cheri, whitley and nick...with a water gun! nick is driving...we are shooting nick with water...haha...very amusing. we kept on makin wrong turns and ended up driving all over detroit in like four hours...was supposed to be a one hour trip..heh!</P>
<P>i think we got like carbon monoxide poisoning as well...hmmm...just a really weird day...there were a lot of funny quotes from the car ride that i was gonna put in here, but I dont really remember anything that was said...i just remember lots of water and wrong directions</P>
<P>best car ride ever!!!!</P>
<P>okay, my story is done...you can wake up now!</P>

"event","<P>today was an awesome day. I mean classes really sucked, but on my free hour i was in my room and my phone rang. it was my dad and he told me to go outside...so i hung up and went outside...and he was standing there by the car with a dozen yellowish roses with pink edges and huge yummy strawberries from papa joe's!!!! that totally made up for when i missed his calls the last time! I was so happy! I hadn't seen him for like two months! :) then we spent like 40 min just walking around campus...he'd never been around kingswood besides the building, so i took him to the oriental garden and the cranbrook house...and i showed him my favorite spots and everything...i didn't realize how much i really missed the guy until today. </P>
<P>anyways...solo and ensemble tomorrow..def. <EM>not</EM> ready. oh well...it's just like 10 min of my life lol!</P>
<P>i'm gonna miss everyone here so much, but i know it'll all be worth it in the end...i mean come on! now i get to hang out with cool people like ed (lauren shut up) and helena!!! </P>
<P>ok, must go now!</P>

<P>fried&nbsp;""hen"" on the steps to the choir room! now that's symbolism and cranbrook art if i ever saw it hehehe! and then what do you know...there was $5 right on the groud next to the dead hen. </P>
<P>three tests today (math, history, and french) and I&nbsp;was completely unprepared since i fell asleep :(&nbsp; ahhhh! but it was ok. history was uber easy. one big essay which i talked about women the whole time which should make hansinger happy. </P>
<P>In french class I got Mr. Meehan to say ""slut"" and ""mother fucker"" (in french)...very funny. I noticed today that he hasn't barked or growled at us in a loong time.</P>
<P>and i'm mad cause it was supposed to storm all week long...have we had any freakin storms yet? NO! eh, baisez-le!</P>

<P><FONT size=1>so...solo and ensemble is next weekend...i'm screwed. I haven't started one of my songs and i haven't had a voice lesson since...early early march!!! kill the hen! it's all her fault! dont get me wrong tho, she has helped a lot and she and murdock pretty much got me into Interlochen! Yay!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>And it's spring, no complaints there. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>i had the craziest week. first my tour guide from interlochen imed me, very random. then a girl from back home toured at ck on thursday (i think) and she was at my lunch table...turns out she lives like a street away from me...very strange indeed.oh..and there were koreans with guitars&nbsp;singing ""allelujia the lord has come"" all during lunch..and they dont even&nbsp;go to our school!!&nbsp;Sex-ed in Bio this week with Sam Hachmeister (sp?) in my class...enough said. Let's not forget Mr. Meehan dancing in class and telling us in french ""I feel myself ""! let me just say i share my french class with about half of my bio class...hmm...and my dad came up to see me on wed and suprise me and take me out to lunch...normally there would have been no problem. except that on wed. i decided to eat lunch at cranbrook instead of kingswood, leaving my dad in his car in the oval waiting...for a fuckin hour. I felt horrible, and i really wanted to see him for once which makes it even worse (plus i think i could have gotten some&nbsp;much needed money from him!!) ahhhh!</FONT></P>

<P>So, I def. can't wait for this whol application process to be over with. I hated going through it with cranbrook, and i think it just might be worse this time around. I finally finished my second essay and asked tejada and amanda to read it, and instead of making me feel how to better my essay, they made me feel really stupid. </P>
<P>They both pretty much said that my writing sucks, I dont know how to use verbs. Amanda made the comment ""dont worry, a least you aren't applying for a writing major there, so they won't expect a good essay"" grrrr... It's just kinda annoying cause i either get people that say ""dont change a thing,it's a great essay"" or people like T &amp; A who tell me it sucks, or tell me that something doesn't sound right w/o telling me how i can fix it. so i'm left feeling lost with a poorly written paper, just the position that i want to be in!</P>
<P>&nbsp;Oh well, i guess i'll do my best to make corrections, then send it on it's way. Well, hopefully i'll get into interlochen. I'm too stupid for Cranbrook. :( I guess on the bright side, i get to see Josh Groban in concert tomorrow. But even that doens't put a smile on my face...someone please cheer me up! ~until tomorrow luv mel</P>"

that maybe i should write about that, and how my dad being divorced for

was so angry with him, i wanted to hate him. I pushed him away...but i
eventually accepted the fact that no one is perfect, even my dad. Yes,

Now history~ yea, that pisses me off,that people are blaming this project on me...brian is complaining saying that i'm holding them back from filming, when i didn't even know that they wanted to film last night...and theresa is complaining and telling people i'm full of shit when i told her i would have something done by study hall..i had it to her within 15 min. I'm sry that everything has to be my fault...but ya know what guys, i really am trying, okay? I'm sry i'm not good enough for you theresa, not everyone can live up to you and your fucking 4.0! fuck you for making me doubt myself, and fuck you for making me feel worthless. 
 and Brian, stop being so goddamned fake!

to everyone else, thanks for being there, i know i've been really busy lately. I promise after my audition i'll have more time. 

To anyone else reading this, i'm not usually this angry, but i've been letting things build up, i've been trying to ignore everything, but i can't any longer. 

I need to get away from here, I really hope that interochen works out. At least i'll be doing something i love there."

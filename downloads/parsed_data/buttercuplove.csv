<big>I'M 20 YEARS OLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!@#$%^&*</big> Wow.
It feels so different because I'm not a teenager anymore. I actually feel older. I don't know if I like it... Anyways, Brett bought me a beautiful green amethyst ring, and it's just gorgeous. His parents bought me a bangle from Coach and it's again really pretty. My mom and dad gave me money towards my credit card bill, and that's about it.

So the last two weeks, I worked at Trinity doing summer theatre. It was such a blast. I had the best helpers on the planet and the best group in the world. I got my big monies paycheck, and went out and celebrated by putting it in the bank. Boring. Haha.

There's a lot to update about but I'm jut too tired so maybe I'll do it later.

So I need to get this scholarship stuff figured out, cuz right now I apparently don't have one... Not cool, cuz I absolutely was awarded one. I can't go to post without a scholarship. I need this.

Today I'm going into queens to pick up jenn's aunt nancy's car. And then we're gonna get some soosh. :) yummm.

I finally finished my George W Bush paper, it sucks. Haha. I've never wrote a worse paper in my life. Whatever. I don't care.

I'd really like to see a bunch of shows on broadway... It's been so unbelievably long since I've been in the city. And I wanna eat at max brenner's. :) hehe.

My birthday's on sunday!!! Ahh holy crap I'll be 20... What an old fart. HAHAHA. Omg ew so old. Okay. Anyways, I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should have a little beer BQ or go out dancing or something awesome. Idk. Help? Suggestions?

I can't wait for the Hamptons fireworks show on Saturday with Brett. :) yay. We're in love."

"event","So I'm sitting in class right now. Yea, I know. It's summer. I shouldn't be in class. Shockingly enough, I'm really enjoying my political science class. It's very interesting. And I love to debate about things, so that's great too.

So everyone should come see the ALUMinate show at Trinity on July 9th and 10th. Not only is it so much fun, but there's some really great stuff in it. Some of Long Island's finest dancers, singers and actors are involved. Don't miss out!

MY BIRTHDAY IS IN 10 DAYS! Oh wow I still can not believe I'm going to be 20. I'm going to get my second earring hole pierced cuz I was always too chicken shit to get it when I was younger. I unfortunately cannot afford a tattoo. I also don't know where I'd put it, I'm running out of room.

I'm really anxious about the ASPCA. I applied a few weeks ago and I would really really like to go over to their headquarters and talk to them about volunteering. I'm scared they won't take me cuz I have like nothing on my resume that involves animals. So I would really like to get more experience. Maybe I can volunteer there like twice a week or something, I don't know. Hmmm...

I should probably go since my professor will be here any minute. Bye bye :)"

"event","So I saw my friend Jesse's show tonight at Nassau. (He is the fat Jewish looking guy in the Little Shop pictures.) Anyway, they did Bedtime Stories by Norm Foster, and I have to say he, and the rest of the cast, did an incredible job. Hysterical. GO JESSE!! :D We all went out afterwards, which was nice, cuz I haven't seen my little shop friends in what seems like ages. I miss them. :(

Tomorrow I'm going into the city to see Next to Normal with James (my brother). I can't wait for that, I've been dying to see it since it was an Off-Broadway production. YESSS can't wait! I also haven't seen my brother since like two weeks ago maybe? He moved into the city in January, and he used to come home every weekend, but now he has a job in the city so he never has time to come home. :(  But I can't wait to see the show, and him. YAY!

Recently I applied to the ASPCA in New York City. So what I'm thinking is maybe I'll go down there tomorrow and make sure they got my application and ask them what I need to be doing, where I can volunteer and stuff. Hopefully I get this job, I want it so terribly. I've been going to pet stores like everyday just to give the puppies and kittens a friendly face to see. I just feel bad that no one is buying them, I wish I could.

I'm wiped. I have so much I want to write but I'm just too tired. And not feeling well. I have these really bad stomach pains that I get after I eat sometimes. I've had them for a while now, and I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm allergic to something? Who knows. I have my physical for Dance Team soon so maybe I'll ask them to check it out.

"event","So following that last entry...

When I finally got ""in touch"" with the Honors college at Pace, I was told that unfortunately I do not have the grades to take part in the Honors college... Um I have a 3.5, what do you need? OH last time I check it was a 3.4... COOL. Whatever. SO I got over that, because honestly before hearing from Pat again, I moved on with my life. I got into CW Post on scholarship, and made the dance team there. And I'm finally HAPPY. That's right. H-A-P-P-Y. I want to stay home, I want to go to Post, I want to work at my dumb office job, and I want to stay with my boyfriend and family.

So anyway, just wanted a quick update on that. I'm about to head over to planet fitness cuz me and Jessie have started operation KICK ASS cuz we want hot bikini bodies. SO WE'RE GONNA GET EM. Woo! I'm so pumped for summer. Summer theatre starts July 6th, and I can't wait for it cuz this year I actually have everything all planned out ahead of time. :) Mike Blais and Leah Brown(?) are my helpers, and Bobby is doing music again. I can't wait to meet my little campers.

I'm gonna go. I'm workin on ma fitness. :)"

"event","So RANDOM: I heard from Pat Woodward this week, my adviser from Pace. Which is great in a sense, but like really fucked up and confusing in another. I had e-mailed her a while back, maybe two months ago, asking if she could find anything out abut my scholarship, like if I'm still eligible for it. And she hadn't answered, so I sent an e-mail to Amy, the MT Director, and she never answered, and then again to Pat, and she still didn't answer. So I kinda took it as a way of subliminally saying ""we don't want you here,"" cried about it for a month, and finally thought, 'you know what, I've gotta get on with my life.' So I applied to locals school for next year, and kinda went on my way with changing majors. And then like a week ago I hear from Pat?! Like really? When I'm finally over it, and finally moving on, I get an e-mail saying, 'hey Trish. I spoke to the Honors college. You should call them.'?? So I called, and got no answer, so I need to call again today... Idk, I'm just like super upset about this because it would be an amazing thing for me, to get back into the city and be where I'm meant to be, but at the same time, I know I'm risking dropping out again if my dad loses his job. So I'm torn about this, but if I can get into Honors, I'd be so fucking happy. Cuz it's like the cost of a SUNY school then.

So anyway, on with typing... Brett and I are about to hit our 9 month streak, which is absolutely unbelievable if you think about it. He said that to me this morning, and I never really realized it until now. And he's right... I mean, we've been dating on and off for seven years. In July it will be seven years. And the fact that we can still maake each other laugh, and cry, and fight for one another, and have the same chemistry as new relationships have, I just can't believe that it's still the same as it was day one. :) It makes me very proud, being in a great relationship.

On Saturday, Brett and I had his Fire Dept. dinner, which was... well HARDLY memorable... I had three drinks and four shots of Patron.. In about two hours... Not good! I'll post a few GOOD pics from the night.

Tonight I have a prep class for my audition for 42nd Street. Amy Dolan is teaching it, she's the director of the show. She was in like A Chorus Line and all this fun stuff, so I can't wait for that. And it would be great to work with John again. I hope I can still tap as well as I could in high school!

Well, I am SO sick this morning, my allergies are really getting to me. So I'm gonna head out, and go back to bed. :)

"event","Wow, just reading through some ""recent"" entries in this made me so angry.

Well I'm super happy to be informing you all of my life (NOT). Today was the day from freakin hell. LET ME EXPLAIN WHY.

So this morning, I get up and everything, and get to NCC around like 9:15. I went to the cafeteria for some breakfast, and like an idiot left my phone unattended. Next thing I knew it was stolen. So I've been phoneless all day, which sounds so bratty but it seriously is like mind-boggling how I can't function without having my phone. Good news though: since I can't afford to buy a new phone, I'm gonna start my own line, and have my own bill that way I get the discounted price, So I think I'm getting an iPhone cuz it's only $199.

More good news: I got a 96 on my psych test. :) woo wooo!

(And even more, I did my Spanish homework for once!)

More bad news: I was supposed to see Brett at 6:30 today... I went to his favorite hot dog guy and bought his favorite hot dogs... Ketchup and onions... But because Lifestar sucks big donkey cojones, they sent him to NJ at 5, and I didn't find out cuz I didn't have my phone. So now it's 10:00 and he's still not home. So I haven't gotten my daily hug.

And to top it off, I just finished up a run of Little Shop of Horrors, which was such a huge success, and I miss it so much. I miss my friends and rehearsing, and costumes and everything. Even my wig!!

KAY, SO...

I'm dating Brett again. It's been almost two months (on the 15th). I am extremely happy with our relationship and it has been going really great. <3
I just did this morph thing on my computer, and found out what our kids will look like. WEIRD.

They're actually gonna be quite adorable. :)


Other than Brett though....
I got a job at Delia's... and quit soon after cuz they really are manipulative. I just miss the people I worked with.
I'm working for a law firm now, and it's really convenient for me cuz it's in the morning before school. It's a really good job, and I'm with my aunt all day.
I went into the city on Thursday and Friday night, and it just goes to show how awesome my friends are because they were just so understanding and made me feel so at home. I love and miss you guys so much!
Jenn and Katie went away to school, so two of my best friends are gone, and now I'm practically friendless, survived by Jessie. HEHE. :) Whom I don't get to see as much as I'd like... But anywho, we are going shopping tomorrow though which shall be fun.
My room is practically finished, I finally put up my stuff on the wall, and finished arranging my furniture. I got curtains, and a sheet set. It's so cute. :) I'll take pictures soon.
Speaking of pictures, I need a camera.
I've found that I've been very down lately, I think it's because of school. I just miss Pace so much, and it kills me to NOT be able to talk to my parents about it. They feel bad enough, I don't want them to know how upset I am.
Because of how upset/stressed I've been, I've also been smoking a lot. ::smack on the hand:: BAD GIRL.
And I've just discovered how awesome Brett's friends are, and Danny Coor always makes me laugh hahah.
K, bye for now. :)"

So I funneled that night, and it was sweeet. And then drove home drunk which was NOT sweet. I think I blew threw every stop sign I hit. And almost went through a red light. NOTTT safe, kids. Don't ever drink and drive. Even if you feel alright.

So that's it about Wednesday.

Thursday I hung out all day with Jenn, and we were in miserable moods because we missed the boys and wanted them to get here ASAP. Stayed at her house Thursday night. PASSSSSED out mad early. And woke up to Justin throwing a backpack at my head... GRR

So Friday was the 4th of July. So I went to my Aunt Peg's house. And SARAH LYNN TRUDEL wasn't there, therefore she's a bitch. She wanted to drink instead with Jill cuz apparently she's cool... But WHATEVER. No but we had a fun time. And we had some yummy food and then sang happy birthday in two different time signatures hahahaha. Great stuff.

So I left after cake cuz we were supposed to go to Jenn's uncle's for fireworks. Unfortunately we didn't, however!!! since we stayed home, we got a fireworks show of our own and it was awesome.

So then we went to Applebees and had some delicious yum yums, and then went home and fell asleep. :) It was a good day <3

And then we hung out at his house, did some work for him, sang some sweet duets for his mom, and then we went to his friend Kyle's. It was fun, the kids were real nice. I funneled for the first time, and I fuckin rocked! =P Yeahhh baby... Played two rounds of beer pong, and sank like 5 cups, which is HUGE for me. I usually get like one in at most. I saw Joey Bus, we had fun. He was always a good guy... But anyway, I just got home, and I'm still kinda drunk, and it's 2 AM. So yea... I gotta go to bed cuz I got LOTSA stuff to do tomorrow...

It took fucking forever, NUMBER ONE. She took 7 or 8 viles of my blood from me, NUMBER TWO. And of course, number three, I started getting foggy, gross, and sweating through my shirt in a matter of.. <big>OHHHHH I don't know,</big> 20 seconds. They had to give me a lollipop and water to chug because I pass out when I get blood tests. <b>I looked like a 5 year old.</b>

The <big>BEST</big> part of my day so far though was my mom telling me I have a bulls eye rash. Anyone know what that is?? Well, if you don't... It's what you get when you have <u>LYME DISEASE.</u> I feel like I'm gonna throw up. So now, I have to go back to the doctor today, if not probably the fucking emergency room, and get MORE blood drawn to run a test for fucking lyme disease. I'm a classy mess...

Went to see The Strangers with Mike... DON'T. FUCKIN. SEE IT. So unbelievably petrifying. We had fun, he was really sweet... Awkward ending to the night though, which really changed everythingg for me.

So since Monday, I've had my reality: Get up, hygiene it up, and go out with Jessie lol. And Tuesday and Thursday nights are spent at Trinity.

Then FRIDAYYY... I slept over Jenn's Thursday night cuz her boyfriend and his best friend were driving down for the weekend from Potsdam. So I get woken up by Jenn saying ""Trish? Wake up. We've got company."" ...And in walked Corey and Justin, the most idiotic / loving guys... Period. So Friday we didn't do much cuz they were tired. I cuddled with Justin and we went in the pool. That night they went to the city while I was at a dance recital. And let me just say: Sarah, Kathryn, Mel; you lit up that stage. Amazing job... So proud.

So then Saturday, I drove up to six flags which was funn. I went on a roller coaster... And scared the shit out of this little boy. I was screaming like a banchee, everyone was laughing at me. :) Next time I'll do more, I swear. So the drive home from Jersey took 4 hours cuz I took the wrong parkway. :( We ended up borderline Pennsylvania and it was fuckin annoying. I let Corey drive home which was stupid cuz I'm a baddddd backseat driver. But we got home in one piece. I stayed at Jenn's that night... :)

Sunday we went to Oma and Opa's house for a barbeque. YUMMMOOO. I love their food... Aunt Nancy gave me a pep talk hhahahah, and then snuck us alcohol. She's amazing. I love how I refer to Jenn's family as mine. And thennn we went home, hung out some more, more pool, etc. Then the best part..

So at like 9:30 we drove to Jones Beach. It was amazing. Until... we got home. And I had two ticks on me... Uhhh no details for that story... And at around 1:00 the boys left for home... :(

BUTTTT... they're coming back in a few days for 4th of July. (AKA my birthday!!)

So I got my nailies painted today with Jenni and they came out terrible cuz I always mess them up. But they still look pretty anyways. They're red. :o) Then we went to the mall and ate some Panera. Anddd we did a little summer shopping. And I went into Charlotte Russe and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I miss Rakeeta, shockingly. It's the other people I don't really care about. Even though she was kinda moody, she was funny. And she liked me. So she said she's suffering without me in her life (kidding, obviously). It was cute.

I'm going on another date with Mike tonight... well actually like really soon haha. So I REALLY need to go.

"event","So Jennicakes inspired me start using this again. And I've been meaning to get a blog, so here goes...

Recently I've been so NOT busy, it's starting to bug me actually. I was working in Charlotte Russe at the Broadway mall, but then I quit because they were completely and utterly ridiculous. So now I don't have a job until July 7th. Trinity's summer theatre starts then, which I'm pumped AND nervous for. I have a lot of work to do. I need to get a lot of supplies, figure out what we're doing for the showcase, and yada yada...

SPEAKING of showcase, John (aka Mr. Farrell) and I are putting together a little shindig for the end of the summer. Basically it's just gonna be a little show all about me, and it's basically the same set up as a cabaret. Hopefully we find a venue to host it cuz the show would be SUCH an awesome experience. So I'm super duper excited. My voice has gotten so different since last I left you!! In a totally awesome way though. It's new, and fresh, and I love it!

Hmmm.. what else... Well I've been going into the city a lot cuz I'm dating this guy, Mike. He's pretty amazing too I guess. And he's probably reading this, so HI MIKE!! :) Funny/awkward story how we met so let's just say we met online... And nothing more LOLZ!@!. No but really, he's really sweet (and 6'4""!! AHHH SO NOT WHAT I'M USED TO!) and for the people who actually are reading this...they're probably my best friends...you guys will love him when you meet him! HUGE sweetheart. And cute too. Good catch, ehh?

I really miss school and I kinda wanna go back. Even though my mom is saying she's not letting me go back, haha. She's funny sometimes. All because one of my grades isn't posted. Whatever, she'll get over it soon.. Haha. Love my family. Seriously though... Love them.<3

I'm supposed to go to brooklyn tonight, but I don't think my momma's gonna let me. Sorry, Nick!! But I AM going to Brooklyn tomorrow with Mike :). We're gonna walk around le city and then we're going to see THE STRANGERS. YIKES!! I'm nervous. But so is he, so I feel better. HAHA.

SO IDK WHAT ELSE... so I guess I'll bid you farewell now.
TA TA, KIDDIES!! :)"

So I've been at Pace for about 7 months. I absolutely love college, and I love my  best friends here. My roommate is awesome, we get along really great. We didn't first, but I don't think we really knew how similar we really are. My classes are awesome, I did really well in the first semester and hopefully I'll do just as good this semester. I do miss all my oldies though and I hope they're having fun at college.
So spring break starts tomorrow and I could not be more excited! I'm cutting my hair, the 'katie holmes bob.' It's for the show I'm doing.
I have an audition for a theatre company in Florida. I am SO excited for that and if I get it, there is no question that I'm going!! These people are specifically coming to Pace to see about 6 of us and Amy (my director) wants ME to go. AJKDHAJKDLH I feel honored.
And I have a boyfriend. He's pretty awesome, <3.

I think I'm actually gonna start using this again..."

Last time I checked it was 96.6 or something. I have a low body temp, don't worry haha. I have to check again though, cuz my fever always goes up around like 2 or 3. It's always in the afternoon. I'm all dressed in red and green. I feel so festive. I can't wait for Christmas, it's tomorrow and I'm so pumped to see my family. Brett's coming too. How cute are we. Haha, anyways. I'm gonna go upstairs and see if I can help with anything. If not I'm just gonna OD on nyquil and pass out.

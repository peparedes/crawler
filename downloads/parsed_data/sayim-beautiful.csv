"event","i love how when it seems everything seems to be going good in life, something just smacks me in the face to remind me that there's no such thing as ""coasting"". thank you highland park police for supplying the reality check this time. appreciate the ticket, too :)
eh, whatever. im over it. what i cant get over is the fact that i cant let this thing with you go. why cant i just accept you and be done with it? i continue to search for a flaw everywhere and make something ridiculous seem sooooo big when i hit a dead end. i have to stop this. and now.

you know, its funny how in the two or three years i have known you guys, i never got a phone call or text from any of you unless her phone was dead, but now that im 21, i get one practically every weekend from&nbsp;you guys.&nbsp;i dont mind doing a favor once or twice, but im beginning to feel as if im just being used for convenience. at first i was all, yea its whatever, but thinking back, i NEVER acted this way around my older friends just for my own pleasure. i mean, i may have done it a few times, but it wasnt like that. never out of the blue and never so consistently. i have to admit, its pretty fucked up. just thought you should know..."

but not to sound like a complete procrastinator, im gonna wait until i come back from florida... theres no way ill survive all that drinking without a cigarette."

"event","i found out tonight why i have not been promoted yet and its probably the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard in my life. apparently i cannot officially become supervisor yet because i havent been withe the company for 6 months yet. ive been in the hotel business for almost a year, but the 5 months at Dolce dont count. at least i only have like 3 weeks left until im at that 6 month mark. but really, what does time have to do with anything? if im the most qualified, im the most qualified. it shouldnt matter that i havent been here that long. i know how to do my job well, or you wouldnt have thought of me for the position in the first place. i guess i should just shut my mouth and feel lucky that i have superiors that look out for me enough to wait until that six month mark to post the job, instead of just hiring someone else or whatever.&nbsp;i need to stop stressing over this though, cuz in all seriousness, my problems wont come til after i get that position. he'll probably leave. i dont think he would leave angry at me, but thats always a possibility im preparing myself for. and as for her... damn, i dont know. i mean,&nbsp;i dont think she would leave for the simple fact she get go anywhere else, but i dont see her adjusting to all this and just being ok with the idea of working under me. shes to proud for that. a part of me hopes she'll get that transfer she wants before i get promoted, so there will be less pressure and drama surrounding their decision. but then another part, the bitchier part, of me cant wait to be her boss. i would LOVE to be the one that drove her away. that finally got her where she belongs-back on the street. but i guess well see. only 19 more days until its being posted :)"

"event","NOT GAS! Because love never really runs out. there's always someone somewhere loving someone else. and im sure love isn't quite expensive. and im sure if your car runs out of love you dont need to wait for like 2 hours for AAA to put some more love in it.... yup. i've decided to make to first ever car that runs on love. EVERYBODY WHO IS ANYBODY is gonna want it.... just you wait and see



and grr... at AAA for being jerks. i called them and asked if there was any way for them t meet me at my car at 11:15 so i wouldnt have to wait for them for like 2 hours after i got out and the asshole receptionist said that tehy dont make emergency appointments. its either oneor the other... so now i have to wait til like 11:30 when i get out of here to call them THEN wait forever til they get here...

I've been going through all my video tapes for the past 2 weeks and I only have 2 more left! Whooo! Finally. Tomorrow I'm going to make a tape of videos and other spiffy things for Rosa. Watching old Are-Oh-Vee episodes brought back so many memories. Oh how I miss the good ol' days.

I'm worried about Winz. She texted me all upset and she tried to call me, but it didn't work. I wish I had a phone card so I could call her. :( I wish I could talk to her and at least try to make her feel better. I don't like when my Winz or any of my friends are upset. Winz, let me know if your internet works again and you're on MSN. I don't care what time it is! We need to talk!"

It's alright, Chrissie and I are going to reenact it with the way it should have went down. And Coldplay was beautiful as always. They make this world a better place.

He's everywhere and I can't keep living my life as if he has no affect on me! Because that would just be wrong. 

Before I reveal who it is, I'll give my reasons as to why I love him.
-He's intelligent.
-He's passionate.
-He's hilarious.
-He's charming.
-He's very hardworking.
-He never disappoints.
-His dancing is so adorable.
-His voice gives me warm fuzzies.
-He calls ladies ""mami.""
-Music is his life.
-He knows how to dress.
-I bet he smells so god damn good.

April 1980 - My brother, Luis, was born.
June 1981 - My brother, Ismael, was born. Same mom as Luis.
June 1982 - I was born.
June 1983 - Maria was born. Same mom as me!
Around 1992 - Dora was born. My dad and mom were still together at this time. Yeah...
Around 1995 - Twins were born. A boy and a girl. Same mom as Dora.

There's also a brother born before Luis, who died when he was a baby. Same mom as Luis and Ismael. And god only knows if there's more out there. 

Look at that! 4 kids within 4 years, with 2 different moms!! And 3 of us have birthdays in June!! Get me out of the freak show. lol"

"event","Maria, my mom, and I went to visit some of my dad's side of the family, but my grandma was the only one home. So we talked to her for awhile. Well Maria and I didn't talk, because my grandma only speaks spanish and we're too embarassed to speak it, so we just sit and listen. lol My mom is all fluent though. She totally sounds like she's Mexican, but she's not. I really should just quit being shy about it and speak. It's not like my family is going to make fun of me. I'm sure they'd be so giddy if I did. I don't know. I'll start talking when I go to Mexico again. lol

So anyways, my grandma was giving us all the latest gossip on the family. Then she started talking about how she has 32 grandkids. Yeah that's a fucking lot. haha And then we started counting just to make sure. When we got to how many kids my dad has, my grandma said 7. Maria, my mom, and I just looked at each other like ""WHAT!!!!"" We only know of 5. My grandma said they're like 8 years old now and they're TWINS!! Ahhhh that's just weird. I just recently found out that I had another sister. She's like 11 years old now and her name is Dora. And now I find out about 2 more. Jesus fucking christ. When will it end!? Those 3 all have the same mom and live in Mexico. I'd like to meet them whenever I go back there. Oh god it's going to be weird. I'm 1 out of 7 kids for my dad. Ahhhh that is just so weird. I can't even describe what I'm feeling. 

It's always just been me and Maria. I've always known my older brothers. But they've lived in Mexico all their lives, so I only saw them when I visited. We always had great times though. One of them moved here with my dad awhile ago and I saw him quite a lot, but still. I always have to remind myself that he's my brother. And I haven't seen my oldest brother in 11 years. AND now I have 3 siblings (2 sisters and a brother) that I don't even know. You know, they're just something really wrong with that.

I think what it really comes down to is that my dad is a slut. lol I'm not mad at him at all. I just wish he would have told Maria and me. We found out about Dora and the twins from other people. And when we confronted him about Dora, Maria asked if he had any other kids and he just laughed and said no. I think he said that because he didn't believe the twins were his back then. But my grandma says they look exactly like him. Oi. My dad is retarded. But I love him.

I don't know...in a way it kinda hurts that I have to share him with more people. I know that sounds so selfish. But I don't want to share him. He's my dad. I know that's such a horrible thing to say, but I can't help it.

This definitely was an interesting day."

I made Rosa the coolest thing for her birthday. Well I think it's cool. I don't know if she'll like it. But I hope so! I already wrapped one of her presents, now I have to wrap this.

All y'alls parents were getting it on at the same time! hahaha Ewwwwww!

Megan and I are going to see Vendetta Red on Monday!! Oh my god I am so excited. I finally get to see them. Wow. Or am I just dreaming? Megan's going to ask her mom for the car and she says her mom won't have a problem with it. I might have to work, but they're playing last. The only thing I have to worry about now is the show selling out. Tickets aren't available on ticketmaster, so I don't know what the hell that's all about. And if we can't go til after I get off work we won't get there til like 8:30, so hopefully it won't be sold out by then. But if I don't have to work, we'll leave probably around 7, so we'll get there when the show starts and tickets probably won't be sold out then. I guess if it sells out we could just put our ears against the wall and listen. That's something at least right? Oh god I hope it doesn't sell out. This may be something I might have to pray for.

I loves me my Rancid! <3 I saw the Will and Grace first season DVD at Best Buy. Oh my god I want it so bad!!! It's $34.99. Damnit. I have to wait a couple weeks to get it. Rats! Oh!! And Pee Wee's Big Adventure is $17.99!!! Holy crap!! That's beyond ridiculous. It's only $5 at Target!! Don't get me wrong, that's an excellent movie, but come on now, that's just a bit expensive. 

I hung out with Emily last night. We went to Best Buy and Walmart. I had gone to Walmart earlier to get paint. That was the first time I bought paint. I didn't know what the hell to do! lol So I called my mommy. The guy who made my paint was way hot though. So Emily and I went to Walmart so I could show her the guy and she needed shampoo. I ended up buying school supplies, because I <b>love</b> shopping for school stuff. Seriously, office/school supplies is the best stuff ever! They didn't have any college rule notebooks though. What's up with that! I still have a month til school starts, so whatever. 

Oh! Some bastard cut me off when I was getting onto the freeway!!! So Emily and I were yelling at him and saying we were going to regulate on his ass...even though he didn't hear us at all because our windows were up. But I'm sure he could sense us yelling. I bet he was scared. 

Tonight and tomorrow I'm rearranging the furniture in my room. I'm putting a new/old dresser in my room, because I have the smallest closet in the entire world. The dresser just got painted white with pink stars. It looks so cute! I love it. And so did my bookshelf and night stand. I think I love pink too much. haha Oh well. I'm also getting rid of this wardrobe thing I have and putting my desk and computer where it is.

Ahhhhh!!! I was so giddy, my hands were shakey!! Emma saw them tonight and after the show she had them all call me. Awwwwww <3 She's so good to me! That was the best part of the day. Best part of my life!! Scott left like a 5 minute message. lol It was the best. I played it for Maria, Emily, and Rosa. They all enjoyed it. Rosa and I decided it's time to put all my concentration on Scott. Yes, I do believe that is the best plan ever. Scott saying my name = the best feeling in the world.

Then after Desiree got off work, we picked her up and Maria, Desiree, Emily, and I went to Pasadena to get my lip pierced. I was all fine and dandy until we walked into the place. Then I started getting nervous. I don't know why though! The first time I got my lip pierced it didn't hurt at all! I don't know. I guess I was scared it might hurt this time. But the guy was <b>so</b> nice. I wanted to hug him. He let Emily come in the room and watch. He asked me why I took it out the first time. Then I told him about the whole thing with Dino. And he actually told me how to take care of it, unlike the stupid guy at Inflictions. Oh I just love that guy. He's the greatest. It didn't really hurt this time. And at first it felt a little weird, but now it's fine. Good times.

And then after that we went to Amoeba. I bought Steven's birthday presents. I got him 6 CDs. I'll have to get those wrapped and mailed soon. I was going to get Chris' present, but I decided to hold off on that. His birthday isn't even til the 23rd of next month. So you know, I got time. And of course Desiree saw a guy she knew there. That girl knows everyone. While she was talking to the guy, I walked passed her and called her a slut and then she kicked me. She thinks the guy didn't know that we knew each other. hahaha Good stuff.

And finally we went driving around and ended up at Walmart. I needed to buy stuff to keep my piercing clean. I saw Gina there! She used to work at my work. I miss her. Work is so boring without her!  

So now I'm home and all tired. I have to work 12-7 tomorrow. I don't really mind. I don't have anything else to do. 

I'm so going to bed. I'll catch up on journals tomorrow before work. 

Scott was right...the hours between 3:15 and 11:15 were quite good. <3"

I went birthday prezzie shopping yesterday. I started getting Rosa's, Chris', and Steven's prezzies together. I still need to get something for Chrissie and Emily even though it's a little late. I have no idea what to get Chrissie though! And Carissa's birthday just passed too and I want to get her something, but she never told me what she wanted!! And Justin's birthday is coming up too. Oh gosh! So many birthdays! I love it.

I also bought Lilo some new toys and puppy treats. I got her a new collar in Arkansas. It's hot pink! She's getting so big! Awwww she's the cutest puppy. I love her too much!

Oh oh oh! I bought Shanghai Knights yesterday too! <3 <3 <3 It was only $12!! And now I have a DVD player that works, so you know I'll be watching that movie all the time. 

I hung out with Emily last night. It was good times. I hadn't seen her in like 5 billion years. She's all busy and junk. Whatever with that!

I'm going to Medieval Times on Sunday! I know I just went, but this is for Emily's birthday. Whoooo! I can't wait. I'm not sick this time so I can cheer my knight on without almost throwing up afterwards. hahaha 

I guess I better get dressed and all that stuff. I have to work today. : / I don't even know why I'm whining I haven't worked in over a week! haha Oh well."

"event","I'm home!!! Woo hoo!!! Although I didn't really want to leave, I'm glad to be home.

To my surprise, I had a lot of fun in Arkansas. I didn't really do much, but I still had a blast. I hated the weather though. It was so gross. The kind of weather that makes me want to cuss. lol 

Oh my god, the cutest thing ever was my 5 year old cousin singing ""Counting The Days"" Awwww it was the best! It warms my heart whenever my cousins sing.

Steven was a complete mess when I was leaving. He was crying and crying. :( It broke my heart. Then I started crying. I really didn't want to leave. It was tough times.

I don't even want to talk about the flight home. It was horrible. But my planes didn't crash because Chrissie was thinking about me. I wasn't alone. <3

So my cousin, Steven, totally loves Tony. Ever since he first met him 3 years ago. He looks up to him and he's his idol. It's actually really adorable. But since I haven't talked to Tony in 5 billion years, Steven didn't get a chance to see Tony when he was here this time. I know he was crushed. But I just kept reminding him that Tony isn't the same person he used to be. He talked about Tony all the time though. I know he was trying to persuade me to want to be Tony's friend again. lol And to be honest, it kinda worked. But just a little bit! And then while I was in Arkansas, Maria and Chrissie hung out with Tony. And Maria said it was nice. So I don't know now. I really don't even want to bother. But I guess there will always be a part of me that's drawn to him. But I don't expect him to call. And I'm definitely not going to call him. I've put our friendship behind me. And if I don't expect anything from him, then there's no chance of me being disappointed again. 

Oh!! I got a package from Winz while I was gone!! She sent me a couple CDs, which I'll have to listen to today, a letter, and the best part...a picture of her holding a sign that says ""I love my Angie""!!!! Awwwww!!! That's the best picture ever!!! That totally warmed my heart. I'm so going to put it on my wall. I have to buy a frame for it first. Awwww my Winz is the bestest!! <3

I better get dressed and all that junk. I have to go to the post office to send Winz an 18 page letter. lol Hey I wrote it on smaller paper, so it's really only like 10 pages! Oh gosh Winz, I'm so sorry. lol

"event","I was in the middle of writing this long ass entry and then the computer froze. Just my luck. And I don't really just want to list what I was going to say, because I actually have important stuff to say. So I'm going to try to remember what I wrote before.

So I'm at my grandparents' now. I had some fun times with my cousins today. We played Nintendo. Yeah old school stylie Mario Brothers. It was great. Everytime I would pass a level I'd say ""that's what I'm talking about!"" and then Wyatt started saying it too. lol It was so cute. And then we watched Gladiators and some MTV. We learned from Gladiators that real men wear purple. Then we listened to Wyatt's Kids Bop 2 and Backstreet Boys CDs. Jealous? Wyatt was singing and dancing along. It was way too cute. And then we had Taco Bell and I dared Steven to put mild, hot, and fire sauce on a chip and eat it. And he did! He didn't even drink water or anything afterwards! That's what I'm talking about.

I had a serious chat with Steven about his real dad today. Steven doesn't know his real dad at all. All he knows it what my Aunt's told him and what she's told him I know is not all true. I don't know how it all started, but Steven said something about his dad not even caring. And I told him that's not true and he doesn't know the whole story. Then he wanted me to tell him the whole story. But I just told him that I don't think his dad is a bad guy and that there's two sides to every story. I told him that I hope he doesn't hate his dad. And he said he doesn't hate his dad, but he also doesn't love him because how can he love someone he doesn't know? Which is so true. I am so happy he doesn't hate his dad. Then I told him that there was a couple years when I had no contact with my dad at all, but now he's trying and has completely made it up to me. And that all I ask of Steven is that if there comes a time when his dad wants to get to know him, that he should at least give him a chance, because people make mistakes and that doesn't always mean that they should be punished forever because of it. And I told him that I know that his dad loves him. He said that he would give his dad a chance, which I think is the greatest thing ever. That really made my day. 

I don't know why the issue of Steven and his real dad is so important to me. I guess it's because it reminds me a lot of my situation with my dad. Not in the sense of not knowing my dad, because I know my dad really well and he was always around when I was a kid. He's a great dad. But he made a mistake and disappeared for a couple years. But ever since then he's been trying so hard to make it up to Maria and I and has totally made it up to me. But when he disappeared of course that didn't go over well with my family. I know my grandparents don't like him and my mom has icky feelings towards him. And I'm sure the rest of my family doesn't enjoy him either. But no matter what their feelings are and what they said about him, it never changed my opinion of my dad. I love my dad so much and there's nothing that could ever change that. So when I hear what my Aunt and grandparents say about Steven's dad, it pisses me off, because they haven't even given his dad a chance. And I worry that their opinions will rub off on Steven and that's not right. Steven should get to know his dad and form his own opinions. I knew Steven would wonder about his dad at some point. I'm glad he came to me and talked to me about it. 

Anyways, I also talked to my Christopher today. Twice!! I talked to him on the way to my grandparents and I just got off the phone with him. I haven't talked to him in awhile. I missed him! He is such a fucking brat, but I heart him oh so much. We talked about how I'm going to start my 4th year of college and he couldn't believe it. He remembers when I was about to start college. Oh man those were scary times. I remember whining to him about how scared I was and he said I was going to be just fine. And look he was right! For once! lol  Awwww I really don't know what I'd do without my Chris. I don't even want to think about that, because it's not going to happen! He's stuck with me forever. He's going to be one of my bridesmaids at my wedding. lol How hot is that! He wants to wear a garter belt though. I don't know about that. hahaha Awwww he's the greatest. <3

Oh yeah! I watched a video of Steven when he was 5 and he was dancing to Chumbawumba, Green Day, and Backstreet Boys. Oh my god I totally forgot about that. It was so adorable!!!! It brought back so many memories. I was about to cry. After the video I ran to Steven, gave him the biggest hug, and told him I love him so much. 

Oh gosh I better go to bed. Our flight is in the morning!! I have a real bad feeling about flying tomorrow. I always get a feeling, but that's mostly because I <b>HATE</b> flying. But this time the feeling is stronger than before. Chris told me not to go, but I can't do that. So I guess I just have to suck it up. Chris is all worried now so I have to call him or email him when I get there.

So I will finally shut up and I will talk to you all when I get back. That is if I don't die! Eeek! Ok I can't think like that. It'll just make me a mess tomorrow. I hope everyone's rest of the week is spiffy! I'll miss you all oodles and oodles and oodles. <3"

So I leave for Arkansas on Thursday to take my cousins back home. Tomorrow I'm going to my grandparents' because they're taking us to the airport. I always enjoy going to their house even though there's not really anything to do there. 

I've been thinking about calling Jen while I'm at my grandparents' to see if she's free to hang out. I haven't seen her in years and I always mean to call her when I visit my grandparents. I miss her so much. 

I registered for Fall quarter yesterday. I got a shitty registration day so a lot of classes were filled up already. Oi it was so frustrating figuring out what classes to take. But I finally sorted it out. I have classes on Tuesday and Thursday. I've never done that before. I'm taking 5 classes so I'll be at school all day on those days. But it's only 2 days a week, so I don't think it'll be too bad. I wouldn't have to take 5 classes if my music classes weren't 1 unit! I hate how most music classes are less than 4 units. It totally makes everything swabbly! It creeps me out that I'm starting my 4th year of college. Ick. I don't even want to think about it. haha I don't start til the end of September, so I'm done thinking about school for now!

I'm getting all these texts from LJ right now. I think they're old texts that people sent. I got 2 from Tracey, 1 from Linz, and 1 from Rosa. Yup they're old because Tracey said something about my midterm and yeah I haven't had a midterm in quite some time. lol It would be nice if I got the texts when people sent them! Swabbly LJ! Or Swabbly phone! Speaking of texts...I have so gone over on my text messages this month. lol I get 500 a month and I think I'm at 610 right now. Oops. haha I don't really care too much because it's only 5 cents for each additional text, but I'm gonna try to cut down until my billing cycle starts again. I think that's on the 15th. So if I'm not texting as much, it's just because I'm waiting til the 15th! It doesn't mean I don't want to text you! I think there's a feature I can add to my plan for unlimited texts. I need to look into that. 

Alrighty. I'm so going to bed now. Goodnight my lovelies!"

So today we're having a wee birthday party for my grandma. My grandparents, Aunt, and cousin (Andrew) are coming over. And the goobers (Steven and Wyatt) are already here. Good times will be had.

I want to go out tonight. But I don't know what I want to do. And I don't have anyone to go out with. lol Oh well. 

The goobers just walked in and are rocking out to the Hippos. hahaha I better go."

"event","So work wasn't so bad. It was really slow during lunch, so I got all my stocking done early. Around 2:30 there was a rush, which I wasn't really down with, but whatever. I'm just glad it's over. I'm pooped though. 

I saw Pirates of the Caribbean again last night. I went with Maria, Emily, Steven, and Wyatt. Wyatt fell asleep towards the end of the movie. He liked it though. Steven loved it. He knows what's up. I love that movie. I could watch it 5 billion times and never come close to getting tired of it. 

I've been thinking a lot about visiting Seattle. I really want to hang out with my girl, Rosa. When she's 21 though. So we can get ridiculously drunk together. Although being under 21 hasn't stopped her from doing that already. hahaha <3 I can't wait. 

Speaking of getting drunk...I have a huge bottle of Smirnoff Triple Black in my closet waiting for me to drink it! AND!! Megan has my fucking rum!!! =O I bet she drank it. You know how that Megan is. hahaha

I think I should go to bed soon. I haven't been getting as much sleep as I would like lately. 

Goodnight my lovelies!"

"event","I really heart when a song does something to me that I can't explain. Whether it be the lyrics, the music, or both, I love when I connect with a song. *sigh* It's the best thing ever. And I don't care what anyone says, I love Kelly Osbourne and I think her album is fucking good. And if you have a problem with that, take it elsewhere because I just don't care hear it. 

<lj-cut text=""I <3 <3 <3 this song"">
""Contradiction"" Kelly Osbourne

<i>When I see you 
I forget all that I saw
I don't feel you anymore

Oh I need you
But I don't need nothing at all

But your kiss
That I don't miss
And you smile
That I defile
And oh your touch
It ticks me off and
Oh your way
It makes me crazy
I don't want you
Do you want me
It's an addiction
The friction
Of contradiction

I love you I love you I love you
When you go

I love you I love you I love you
So tell me no

I love you I love you I love you
Leave me alone

I hate you I hate you I hate you
I need you so

Tell me more now
But don't let me know too much
The knowledge screws me up

And I may want you
But I don't want nothing at all

But your time
When I'm busy
And your mind
To make me dizzy
I'll be fine
When you don't miss me
You'll be mine
When you don't piss me Off
Why can't you see right though me
And my addiction for friction and contradiction

I love you I love you I love you
When you go

I love you I love you I love you
So tell me no

I love you I love you I love you
Leave me alone

I hate you I hate you I hate you
I need you so

I love you I love you I love you
Get out of here

I love you I love you I love you
When you're not near

I love you I love you I love you
You're killing me

I hate you I hate you I hate you
What's wrong with me </i>"

"event","Once the decision was made, things fell into place easily enough. The jet that the Guild kept in  New York couldn't be moved to Africa, but the Guild had longer-ranged aircraft. Maybe not left in Africa, but they could have one ready if it was necessary.

There were several days filled with getting various things set up. There were secure lines that he and Ororo could be contacted through. Even though they would have communicators with them. he'd also gone out and gotten new satellite phones for himself and Ororo. Where they were going, cell phones would be iffy.

He made certain that his number was left for a couple of the students. Kate and Timothy. He'd input it onto Jono's Sidekick and sent a letter to Eddie with the number and permission to give it to Wicked. The team got all numbers for him and Ororo, including how to get ahold of them through the Guild.

There'd been the one fight to break up with Timothy. And the letter from Ian. That he'd had to sit down and read through a few times. He rubbed his hand over his face, feeling almost guilty about his choice for the first time since he'd made it.

There was a package and a manila envelope left inside Ian's apartment on the dining room table the next morning.

Inside the package was a brand new Sidekick with several numbers already programmed into it. One of them was Remy's new number. The others were marked 'Jean-Luc', 'Mercy' and 'Ororo'.

The manila envelope held a certificate for a first-class ticket to the nearest airport to Wakanda and a letter.

<lj-cut text=""Letter to Ian"">
Ian,

I wasn't sure how to respond to your letter. I'm still not sure how to respond.

I'm not staying at the school. Ororo...before she came to Xavier's, she was living in Africa. I won't go into everything, but an old friend of hers has asked for her help. A lot of people over there lost their powers. It's a bit of a mess and he's hoping that she can help get things under control again.

She's asked me to go with her. I'm not entirely sure how much good I can do, but I know that I can't stay here. I trust Scott, but I can't trust Sentinels and I can't trust the government. Funny thing, that.

You don't have anything to apologize for. There were a lot of things said and done on both sides that we're sorry for. I knew you never hated me, even though I wouldn't have blamed you if you had.

I regret all of those things as well. I regret that I didn't tell you everything that first night back, or at least let you know that I couldn't talk about it right then. I regret letting you walk out, rather than trying to talk things out.

Most of all, I regret that I didn't give you a chance to accept things. I was wrong.

We're heading to a place called Wakanda. I don't know if you've ever seen it on a map, but it's kind of small. The Sidekick has the info you need to get ahold of me or Ororo. Satellite phones, so they should work just fine. If they don't, the other two phone numbers are for my father, Jean-Luc LeBeau, and for my sister-in-law, Mercy LeBeau. Either one of them will be able to get info to me, and I should be able to check e-mail as well.

The certificate is for a travel agent that I trust. If you want to come and if you get a chance, maybe you could come over to Africa for a while. It would be somewhere more than Maine that we'll have been. And maybe we can see another sunrise together, oui?

I still love you, Ian. I've never, ever regretted that.

I'll be as careful as I can. You be careful too, all right?

Je t'aime.

I've really got to start writing in this more often. Not that there's been a whole hell of a lot to write about lately, but I really should make more of an effort.

Finals are done with. Kids have all done pretty well. Don't know if I'm offering another, more advanced French class next semester or if I'm going to carry on with French II for more indepth learning. I think I'd prefer that. There's a lot more I can get into a full year than just a semester.

There's a new school for mutants in town. MAMAs been about as nice to them as they have to us. Which is to say, not at all. I do feel sorry for those children. From hearing some of the children talk, though, I think that some of our kids are going to be transferring. Can't really blame the parents, I guess. Doubt it's all that comforting to have your children being taught by the X-Men.

Especially if you ever go looking into just how many times we've rebuilt this school.

Ah well. Just because we have students leave doesn't mean we won't get more. I have full confidence in that. Unfortunate that the kids have to look for places like this, but at least they exist, right?

Things are going well with Ian. We had a conversation that didn't end in either of us running away. It was awkward, but I think it's a good step in the right direction. We're going to come out of this and it'll all be fine. Or, close to fine.

Everything is set for me to go back to Louisiana for the New Year. It'll be useful to get an idea of just what is really needed there yet. And I'm looking forward to seeing everyone again. Hell, I'm looking forward to actually being able to spend a couple of days with Poppa. Used to be he might get a couple hours away to see me when I snuck down. Now I can actually go home.

It's almost strange to me, just how necessary I'm finding that to be.</lj-cut>"

It's getting easier. Slowly but surely, we're relaxing back into each other's company again. It's not easy and sometimes I really have to sit on my hands so that I don't reach out and touch him without his permission.

But Ian touched me during dance class this week. And like a fool, I tensed up about it, but I relaxed almost right away. Because it just felt nice to have his hand against my shoulder again. It didn't last, but...it was a start. It was something.

Gotta talk to Scott and Rogue about doing something with Eddie. It's bad enough that so many of these kids get it in their heads that they're stronger or know better somehow. That they can just push themselves to the fastest levels and learn everything there is to know. It doesn't work that way. And so many of them seem to have this romanticized idea of what being an X-Man is. The kind of idea that walking them out to the memorial garden isn't going to help.

Especially not with Betsy back in residence.

That was a surprise. Guess it figures, though. X-Men aren't real good at staying dead. We had a pretty decent conversation, I think. Not too terribly awkward. Or, at the very least, could have been ever so much worse.

Need to remember to sit down and just talk with Ororo more often. I don't do it often enough and I felt a lot better for the conversation. I hope she did too.

Right. Papers to grade. Going to hit the Danger Room for a bit later. If I'm lucky, nothing much will happen for a while and the school can just go on being a school.

And yeah, I did just knock on wood. Isn't that just sad?</lj-cut>"

If it's going to be like that every week, I'm thinking we might want to give up the dance class.

That was painful. There's just no other word for it. I want to touch him but I don't dare. I want to tell him everything will be all right, but I can't lie to him. I want to be able to put that uniform back in his closet, then curl up around him and just watch him sleep. I want to be able to get to sleep without having to rely on pills again, but it's looking like I'm going to have trouble every time I see him.

Fuck. I never, ever wanted to cause him pain. I didn't want to cause Rogue pain. I'm really, honestly starting to believe that I don't belong in a relationship. That I don't deserve to have a love like that. Every time I admit to it, something goes wrong and I'm alone again.

I'm being melodramatic. God, I'm such a--I'm not finishing that thought.

Right now, my best bet for getting through this is to concentrate on the students. To teach my classes and just deal with things as they come along. Try to convince them that going into the X-Men is something they should think about after college. After they have more to offer the team than just their powers. Not sure I should be talking about that. Lord knows I can't tell them about what I offer the team.

Ignoring any reports about Gulf Coast hurricanes. I just...there's nothing I can do about them. I won't ask Ororo to exert herself again. I'm just tired of it all.

Mercy and Belle can handle it. I trust them. I maybe trust Mercy a bit more than Belle--okay, a lot more than Belle. But they know what they're doing and they know who needs help.

Belle agreed to the changes. It took an hour, but she did it. And I had to explain to her why. I'm sure she'll needle me about it later, but she was...remarkably understanding.


I still love him. I don't think it could hurt this much unless I actually loved him. I don't think I could still want to touch him as badly if I didn't still love him.

I love Rogue and I love Belle too. Those are older hurts, ones that have started to heal. I'll always love them.

I'll always love him.

There's just no way to fall out of that kind of love.

"event","Remy looked at the phone for a long while in the morning. He had woken up early, then realized that he had to wait a while until Belle might actually be awake. Not that he was looking forward to the conversation. It needed to be done, though.

Not that it would make things better with Ian. He was pretty certain at this point that nothing would.

Finally, he got fed up and picked up the phone, punching the numbers in and sitting back to wait for it to be picked up.

<lj-cut text=""The ensuing fight was long and loud, but then again, any conversation with Belle was like that these days."">
The ensuing fight was long and loud, but then again, any conversation with Belle was like that these days. Belle pointed out that Candra had made the Guilds for specific purposes while Remy reminded her that Candra didn't own the Guilds anymore. He told her that the Elixirs were gone and she growled about whose fault that was.

All in French.

All very loud.

He would have to apologize to David and Emma. Possibly Ororo. He was pretty sure that it didn't get any farther than that.

It went like that for an hour before they seemed to run out of steam. Remy sat back, hand over his eyes and just trying not to think. The phone was still to his ear.

""<i>Why are you doing this, Remy?</i>"" Belle's voice was soft, puzzled. ""<i>You never showed any interest in the Assassins' Guild before.</i>""

He snorted, letting his hand drop to stare at the ceiling. ""<i>How many Assassins have you got that have never had the Elixir, Belle? How much longer until those who have lose their powers? And just because I never talked about it doesn't mean I didn't have an interest in your Guild. I just never agreed with it.</i>""

""<i>You never told me that, Remy.</i>""

""<i>Never told people a lot of things. That's gotten me in trouble.</i>""

There was silence on the other end of the line, then a sigh. ""<i>You have any suggestions as to what to do instead, Patriarch?</i>""

""<i>Oh, don't fucking go and use my title like that, Belle.</i>"" Remy really, really wasn't in the mood. ""<i>I don't know. Your people would make excellent bodyguards. The pay isn't as good as assassinations, no, but it is easier to come by.</i>""

""<i>Bodyguards.</i>"" He could almost hear the sneer over the phonelines and braced himself for another fight. It didn't come, though. Instead, she said, ""<i>I will consider it.</i>"" Then, before he could be relieved, ""<i>Is this about your lover? The one Mercy mentioned?</i>""

He was going to kill his sister-in-law. ""<i>We broke up. Partly because I'm working with you, partly because of the Assassins. Mostly, I think, because I've never shown that I trust him. Not enough.</i>""

""<i>That was dumb,</i> mon ami.""

""<i>No fucking kidding.</i>"" Remy sighed, rubbing his eyes. ""<i>I did trust him, though. I just never quite worked out how to tell him that.</i>""

""<i>I find English works best.</i>""

""Belle...""

""<i>All right, all right.</i>"" He heard her shifting papers around on her end. ""<i>Look, Remy, I'm not going to lie to you. You and me, we fight like cats and dogs--yes, I know. That makes me the bitch. And I hated you for a long time. But I think...you screwed up, Remy. You know it. Learn your lesson and move on.</i>"" She probably didn't mean it to be that cold, but it hurt. ""<i>Maybe he's a better person than I am and can forgive your dumb ass.</i>""

It brought a bit of a laugh to his own voice. ""<i>Thank you, Belle. You're all heart.</i>""

""<i>Only if it's fresh from my enemy's chest and still beating.</i>""

And now he remembered why they didn't talk about her work. ""<i>We'll talk again soon, Belle. More about toning down the Assassin work.</i>""
</lj-cut>

They said their good-byes and Remy hung up, rubbing his hands over his face before looking at the clock. It was almost noon. He'd better be getting ready for lunch, then class. Even if it didn't seem like such a big deal now.

It's over.

I'm such a god-damned coward at the best of times. I really, really didn't want to tell him. I wanted to be able to just hold him and ignore it. Pretend none of it was happening. That I hadn't gone to New Orleans and become the Patriarch. That I don't now lead the Assassins as well as the Thieves.

I think it was the Assassins that got Ian worst. <s>I'm not</s> <s>I could never be</s> I suppose I am, in a way, aren't I? If I'm their leader, it makes me an assassin as well as a thief. The rest of them have the luxury of picking one side or the other. Even if I consider myself a Thief, there's always going to be a little bit of me that wonders.

He'll never know how much it hurt me to tell him. Because all I wanted was for him to be happy. I will admit, he's the one who broke it off. I always knew he would because I wouldn't do it. There's no way in hell I could ever turn my back on him. I love him. Of course, I also still love Belle and Rogue, so I'm not sure what that says about me. Probably that I'm a major dumbass that doesn't know when he's licked.

Maybe he could have accepted it better if I had told him that first night, right when I came home. When I stood there in his window, watching him sleep and aching because of what I had seen. Because of what I had done. When I stood there and knew that a handful of oaths meant he was likely going to leave me. I always knew it wouldn't last, but I would have thought that the X-Men would come between us long before the Guilds would.

I'm a fool. I'm a fool and this just hurts.

I'm not stupid enough to think that I won't fall in love again. Despite the masks and not being the most trusting of people, I do love. Possibly too easily. Maybe not easily enough. Shit, I don't even know right now. My mind is just going around in circles.

What I do know is that I'm going to call Belle in the morning and curtail the activities of the Assassins Guild. In a few years, the Thieves are going to start aging and the Assassins are going to lose their powers. Maybe Candra will come back and try to turn us against each other again for the Elixirs. It'll be fighting in the streets again if that happens. New Orleans has seen enough trouble now, without the addition of warring Guilds once more. If it happens...it doesn't matter. I've lost Ian. I've lost Rogue and Belle and Genevieve in their times.

He didn't even say good-bye. I'm not sure he could find the words.

For what it's worth, Ian, if you ever read this...I'm sorry. I love you and I'm sorry I couldn't be who you thought I was. Who you needed. Who you deserved.

I'm sorry.</lj-cut>"

It is done.

Father finally convinced those who were against it to allow the ceremony to take place here in Dallas. I think that had more to do with the fact that he informed them he was retiring tonight whether there was a new Patriarch in place or not. They couldn't exactly leave the Thieves' Guild without some sort of leadership for the six months or so it's going to take to deal with getting the city up to spec again. So they finally allowed it to go through. Probably a good thing they did. Another day of waiting and we may have had more trouble with the Assassins.

The ceremony was nice. I can't exactly go into details. Might get my tail kicked for telling state secrets and all. Father told me later that it was a lot longer than any previous initiation. Which makes sense since we had to incoporate the Assassins into it. I'm pretty sure that Belle didn't like the idea of having to bend knee before me. That girl has one hell of a stubborn streak, but I think even she knows we need to be strong right now. Combining the Guilds is in all our best interests.

Once the cermony was done, we holed up to talk about how to deal with Katrina. Not that there's a hell of a lot that we can do. Help kick in with rescue efforts, I suppose. We can probably use our resorces best with the refugees in Baton Rouge and other cities around the coast. I know that more places than just New Orleans were hit, but that is our home and those are our people. They are the ones that I feel we need to concentrate on. 

We're heading back for New Orleans in the morning. Some of our people will be left behind to help with rescue efforts. Tante Mattie, Father, Mercy and I will be going north to Baton Rouge to start getting things set up there. It's not quite two hours from New Orleans, so there are a lot of refugees there. They're the ones that the Guilds will be doing the most to help, I think. Them and the poor people who couldn't get out in time.

I know I'm going to look at the city in the morning and my heart will break. Eighteen years ago, I used to run those streets. The streets were my home. How many people were killed there when the levees failed? People who couldn't evacuate because there was nowhere for them to go? Who may not have even realized there WAS a reason to evacuate? What hits me hardest are the children, though. So many...

Fagan lives, though, and got his pickpockets out of town with the rest of the Thieves. They aren't actually part of the Guild, but Fagan and Father are friends. At least I know some of the street children are safe. It makes me feel better. Not a lot, but some.

Some of the Thieves and Assassins have been grumbling, wanting to know why, if mutants are so great, why couldn't one do anything to stop Katrina. I nearly snapped one's head off for saying that around me. It's not that Ororo wouldn't have wanted to kill the hurricane and make sure the Gulf States were all safe. It's that she can't. To do so would set off a chain reaction that could have had dire effects all over the world. You'd think these people had never heard of the Butterfly Effect at all. Besides, Ororo took some of the bite off the storm as it was. Things could have been so much worse had a catagory 5 made landfall rather than a catagory...whatever it ended up being. Catagory 4, I think. Bet that girl stayed up all night to try to bring it down.

I haven't even had time to think about how I'm going to talk about my new position with Ian. It would be bad enough, I think, being the Patriarch of the Thieves' Guild. I'm not sure he realizes I still AM a thief. Adding in the Assassins?

This may be that other shoe. The one that always seems to drop once I've said 'I love you'. Most of the time I can't say it until it's already too late. At least this time I had a few weeks of time before things went horribly wrong. And they will. I just hope that he realizes that the reason I never told him these things to begin with is...well, I am not a good person. I'm a thief. I'm now THE thief, along with heading the Guild of Assassins. I'm working side by side with my ex-wife, who doesn't seem to quite hate my guts as much as she used to. My attention is going to be divided even more ways. And I just...I can't make him the first thing in my life. I wonder if I ever could have.

I'm sorry, Ian. So, so sorry.

I return to New York tomorrow from Baton Rouge. I'll be leaving the Guilds in the hands of Belle, Mercy, Father and Tante Mattie. Father just wanted to retire from the paperwork, I think. I don't know what I'll do once I'm home. Curl up and sleep, I think. And maybe see if I can't get some advice from someone in the house about how to tell Ian all of this.</lj-cut>"

God damned timing. Just as I get to New Orleans, I've got to leave. Of course, they're evacuating everyone. I don't think we're going to be able to do the initiation until we're back in the city. Which may mean delaying my return to the school. Father's not about to let me leave until it's done.

It was a surprise, knowing why he called me back. Leading the Guild...the GUILDS. He's hoping to combine them into the Unified Guilds. It would mean an end to the fighting. The same fighting that killed Henri. I reminded Mercy that Julien wasn't working under the Guild's orders, though I'm not always real sure of that. Marius was angry with me for what happened to Belle. What happened to Julien too, though really, that was Julien's fault.

Doesn't matter right now. What matters is trying to get things settled here.

Need to e-mail everyone and let them know I'm all right. Let Ian know I'm hoping to be home by Labor Day. Let Emma know it might be a bit longer.

Shit. What is it with me and women? Even the storms named after them don't like me!</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""E-mail to Ian"">Ian,

Sorry this is so late, cher. I was caught in discussions with my father all day yesterday, then Tante Mattie wouldn't let me get away long enough to send anything. And now we're evacuating, so I have to keep these short.

I'm hoping to be back by Labor Day, but there are things that I need to take care of down here and Katrina is making it difficult. Just so you know, my father didn't call me back because anybody was sick or dying. I'll tell you more when I get home.

I love you.

<hr>
<lj-cut text=""E-mail to Staff"">Just wanted to let you all know that I'm safe. The family is evacuating along with most of New Orleans. I don't know how long I'll be. Just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry.

<lj-cut text=""Emma"">Emma,

Right. Here's the deal.

My father is retiring as Patriarch of the Thieves' Guild and he's asked me to take his place.

I've said yes.

However, the initiation can't take place anywhere other than New Orleans. Which is in a bit of a state right now, as you might imagine. Depending on how fast Katrina blows out of here, I might be stuck for a while. If it doesn't look like it's going to go before Labor Day, I'll head back to Westchester and take a long weekend to get this done.

I know that it isn't a good idea to do this so near the beginning of the year, but I don't have much of a choice. They're family and they need me. I'll contact you when I know more.

This trip to Maine may have been the best thing for all of us. Bobby is certainly more relaxed. It's good to see. It'll probably change once he gets back to Mansion, but it's good to see him let go for a bit.

Things with Ian have...progressed. We've said 'I love you'. Hell, we've even said it in as many words. It's not something I ever thought would come out of my mouth again, no matter how much I may feel it. They seem to be cursed words where I'm concerned. I don't want to see something happen to Ian. I never want to see him hurt, and I know I would protect him if I could. But there are always going to be things that I can't keep from harming him.

Like Belle. God, I should have left that picture behind in my desk. I could see it in his eyes when I told him I'd been married. But how the hell do you bring something like that up? Especially when it was nearly ten years ago and nothing was ever done about it. And when I thought for years that she was dead, then she wasn't, then she didn't remember me and now she hates me?

That...looks really fucked up. And it is. Things with Belle and me are not normal. They can't ever be normal. But Ian got this hair up his ass about it meaning that I must want to be married. That I wanted to be with girls. Something like that. I don't think he's ever going to reconcile the fact that I am bi and I do like girls. That doesn't mean that I don't love him and want to be with him.

I like girls. I like sex with girls. It's not for everybody, but that's all right.

I love Ian. I WANT Ian. And I think, sometimes, that disbelief is going to be the end of me. It gets more and more difficult to keep hold of my tongue when he tries to push me away because of some perception he has about my likes and dislikes and what I really want. I don't want to get mad at him, especially for something that I know isn't entirely his fault. But it's just...too much sometimes. Almost too much to deal with.

He apologized a few days later, taking me out for a picnic. I think he's getting more used to me touching him in public. He certainly didn't complain when we ended up behind those bushes. Too bad that family had to come by. Nearly gave me a heart attack. It wasn't any easier for Ian, from the way he looked. Still, I think he had fun.

We're heading back to the Mansion soon, and then it's only a few more weeks until classes start. I'll be glad to get back into the classroom, though. I won't even mind doing the bo class with Eddie, though I think I'll open it up to other students who can get the required permission. I'm not about to teach it to someone that Logan doesn't think is ready, and he knows what the kids know better than I do.

I can't believe I'm giving myself more work. I think Scott's getting to me.</lj-cut>"

It's been a good couple of weeks. Finally caught up with Kitty. She seems to be doing all right. We're all just waiting for August to get here, though. As much as we love the students, we need some adult time as well. Though I have no doubt that Scottie's hoping to get some team time in as well. Which may be more difficult since a bunch of us really want to get out of the Mansion for a while.

Kitty's one of them. Can't really blame her. It's hard enough for her to get time to go see Wisdom. The late start on the school year likely didn't help. Next summer should be easier for her, though, since it should be a more normal summer. She seemed to take me dating Ian pretty well. Then again, she knows what it's like to try to choose one person over another, though I doubt anybody would want to remind her of Piotr right now, wherever he's gotten off to.

Grace, Bobby, Ian and I are probably going to take off for a little while over the summer as well. Grace has mentioned Maine. I'm sure Ian's going to just roll his eyes about it, but it would be good to get away from the cities for a bit. He can't let his control slip, not with Bobby and Grace's brother there, but maybe I can get him out away from people for a bit so that he can let himself go a little. You can't keep all those emotions behind your shields all the time. That's really not safe.

I owe my father another call. I think it amuses him that I've called him more often since I started teaching here than in all the years since I left New Orleans. Tante Mattie says he's pleased as well, though, so it's not so bad for all that. If only I could convince the students that I'm not the person to talk to when they're having relationship problems. And I probably shouldn't be giving sex advice. At all. Ah well. I hope Kate appreciates what I showed Timothy.

I'm still thinking about last Friday. I get hard just thinking about his eyes. He's so used to letting his empathy do the connecting that I'm not sure it ever occured to him that eyes could do the same thing. I wonder if it would surprise him that it's not his body I think of at night but rather those green eyes of his. To be able to watch his face, to see what he's feeling in his face rather than depending on our powers... I've got to find a better position, though. That one puts too much stress on his back.

I should do this more often. But the last couple of weeks have been pretty quiet, all told.

Scott's closing himself off. Which probably isn't a good thing, but you can't force the man to do anything. He has to decide for himself how to handle this. Maybe, once Jeannie comes back, he'll get better again. And she will come back. She has to.

I need to track down 'Ro sometime soon. I shouldn't let so much time go between when I talk to her. She's family, after all. I need to catch up with Kitty as well. I promised Jeannie that I'd keep an eye on her, and I do try hard to keep my promises.

I've talked to Rogue. She's expanding her room and I've offered to help her out with that. It's nice that we're friends again, though it's still difficult to talk to her about some things. I really don't want to talk to her about Ian, though she's right when she says that it only makes things harder. I know she doesn't want details, but how do you talk about your current love interest to your ex-girlfriend?I have to find a way, though.

Managed to catch Bobby. Or, rather, Bobby caught me. I shouldn't let him hide as much as he is. Unfortunately, other than offer another ear, there's not much I can do. Inviting him out for basketball, throwing him in the pool, that only helps so much. Flashes of the old Bobby, of the kid he still tries to pretend so hard that he is, but it's not permanent. I wish to God I could find a better way to reach him. Or even just understand his problems. Other than letting him know I'm here for him, I'm not sure there's anything I can do.

Ian and I have been spending a lot of time together. I'm being damned careful not to forget my duties here at the Mansion, which makes it difficult sometimes. I can't just go on a date when I know the students might need me for something, and I can't ever leave my comm behind. I worry about leaving a uniform at his apartment. I don't want him to think about what it means. The alternative is to tuck one in the trunk of the car. Which may not save me time in the end, but it may make Ian more comfortable.

On the other hand, I'm not sure there's anything that will make him more comfortable with the fact that I'm an X-Man. He's always going to worry about me going out and not coming back. Or coming back seriously injured. I think what really worries him is that I'll come back injured and they won't be able to save me. And he'll have to sit there and watch me die.

I can handle death. It's something that I've learned over the years. It comes with being an X-Man sometimes. Of course, if you're like Jeannie, it doesn't tend to stick, but it can happen. I don't want to see it happen to the kids, and I'd rather not see it happen to any of the team. And I'd really rather it not happen to me, though I can handle it, I think. One day, he's going to have to learn to accept it too. I'd rather he not, but death happens.

I suppose I need to tell him that I won't ever leave him without a fight. When I die, I hope that it'll be in a blaze of glory. 

Which all reminds me, I really do need to track down the new girl. Wicked, I believe Ian said her name was. What a name...but, she's from Genosha. They do things differently there.</lj-cut>"

Jean's gone. The Professor contacted her and called her to Genosha. My guess is that Scott isn't taking it terribly well, but he's been hiding. I won't go and try to pull him out yet. Let the man handle this however he can first. Though, honestly, I'm beginning to think that a X-Men drinking day is seriously becoming called for. Between Scott and Bobby...

Bobby's seeing a therapist. Which is good, I think. I've been telling him that he should talk to someone for a while now, since before he left for Genosha in March. He's family. I worry about him. I should track him down and make sure he's all right.

I've apparently become school counselor, at least to a couple of the students. Timothy especially. Ran into him this week while he was hiding from Rogue. Apparently she ran a teamwork exercise with Timothy and Eddie and it went fine. Except for the fact that Timothy's got it into his teenage boy head that Eddie is trying to steal Kate away from him. I've seen the way that she looks at Timothy. The chances of Eddie having a chance getting her away from Timothy are somewhere between slim and none, and slim was catching the next bus out. Ah well, they're teenagers. What can you expect?

I am lucky, however, that things are going as well as they are between myself and Ian. After the fight last Friday, I talked with Jane some, and she made a point that I should talk to Ian and find out more about Billy and about what happened that night. Knowing how much he loves to talk about his past, I had to make a deal that if he told me about Billy, and I'd tell him about the Massacre. Well, I didn't phrase it that way, but that was what it boiled down to.

It was difficult hearing him talk about Billy, not because of envy or anything else but because I know how deeply Billy's death affected Ian. But I think it did him some good, though, talking about Billy and what happened that night. Maybe it'll finally start to bring him some closure, though I think the part that bothers him most is the fact that Billy thought he was dying alone. He felt that, which is why he has his troubles shutting people outside his shields.

I was surprised he handled finding out about the Massacre as well as he did. He was shocked, yes, and angry, but I'm not sure the anger was aimed at me. He certainly didn't want me to leave. In fact, he didn't even flinch when I asked to stay the night because I didn't want to drive back to the Mansion. I think we both really just needed someone to cling to that night. Hell, I even slept naked and he didn't bat an eye.

It laid the framework for Saturday night, though. I can't put into words what happened that night. 'Ian and I had sex' just doesn't sound right, but neither was it 'making love'. It was something in between, a connection, though I'm not sure it was that profound. He's a beautiful man and a responsive lover. Apparently he likes to be held down. I'll have to consider that more thoroughly.

Also need to find thank you gifts for Grace and Lotte, to repay them for their help. I gave Emma chocolate, so that might not be a bad idea for Grace. Maybe the same for Lotte. I'll just tell her to hide them from Ian so that she can have them to herself.

I should find something for Ian as well. He gave me a beautiful silk shirt. Lord knows he deserves a very large something for putting up with me."

Right. That's that taken care of. Everything is in motion for Saturday. Just need to get the menu together and figure out the logistics.

I shouldn't be this nervous. I wouldn't, except that we had a fight the other night. I came back pretty well bruised up from trying to help Friday (Note to self: Do not go into a fight with that woman unless she's sober) and he...

Well, he reacted pretty predictably. I've been expecting it. I'm not sure he quite realizes just how much being an X-Man means to me, and he can't unless I tell him everything. Which I've promised to tell Lotte, simply because she needs to realize that she's not the only one who has made bad mistakes, but that's for another day. As strong as I know he is, I'm not sure if he can handle it. Hell, most of the time I'm not sure if <i>I</i> can handle it, and I lived through it. Then again, it involves telling him about one time when I almost did die. Maybe he'll understand then that I'm stronger than he thinks. Maybe.

Anyway, went to help Friday get her boyfriend back out of the hands of the Mutant Mafia. That was fun, only not. Got slapped around by an eight-foot gorilla. In a zoot suit. That really should be funnier than it is. Still...okay, it's pretty funny as it is.

The kids are getting restless. Timothy thinks that Eddie is going to try to steal Kate away. Which I'd like to see him try, because Katie would give him a piece of her mind. And then she'd turn around and give Timothy another piece for thinking that.

He also said that he thought Rogue liked me. The good kind of like. Shit. I can't deal with this.

Better to concentrate on Saturday.

And call Tante Mattie and Father to apologize for having been a teenager.</lj-cut>"

Geez. Busy week.

Finally managed to get the team together for some basketball. I'd mentioned it to Bobby once, but then I didn't do anything about it until last Friday. Then I sent out an e-mail and got everyone out onto the court at midnight. Just the adults, including the TAs and Ian. Ian was cute and thought I'd e-mailed him on accident.

It was good because I dragged him into the TV room after the game and we watched ""The Princess Bride"". He didn't make fun of me for liking a girl's movie. Not that he got to see a lot of it. We ended up on the floor before the end, kissing. Which would have been fine at his place. In the middle of the TV room at the Mansion? Not so much.

I slept over again Friday night. That was nice. I don't think he even realizes how much it means to me to have him sleeping against me. Touch...I wanted that with Rogue. I have it with Ian. I feel a little bad about that, but...well, I think I have to let it go. Rogue and I are doing well. We've gotten...somewhere. We're still friends. Funny. I used to say that just being friends with her would hurt worse than not having her around at all. Now...guess things change. I want her as my friend, not just as someone who lives here.

Too many people around here to worry about. Something is up with Bobby. I don't know what to do to help him. Every time I pull him out of his shell, he goes back in. Short of locking his door behind him so that he can't retreat, I don't know what to do. Not that I can't lock his door behind him. I'd just rather not. Seems a lot like forcing the issue.

Kate's mad at Bobby because he's been home two months and hasn't contacted her. Which I can understand. I really can. If he'd been here that long and hadn't given me a holler...okay, he wouldn't have because I'd have tracked his ass down and dropped him in the sauna or something equally nasty. She gave up after trying to catch him for a few days, which I'm sure didn't help. I told her to e-mail him. Which is something she should have done in the first place when she couldn't catch up with him, but I'm not going to tell her that. I would have thought it made sense, though.

She's also stressing out because she's putting all this pressure on herself. She's almost seventeen and she still gawky and frizzy hair and she thinks she's dumb. She doesn't understand that these things happen. She'll grow out of the gawkiness. Her hair may always be frizzy. I swear, we should let her see Kitty when the humidity gets high. Love you, chaton, but you know it's true. Kate is doing fine, but she's got this idea that you've got to be perfect to be an X-Man. Katie, if you only knew...

Talked with Timothy as well. Still trying to ignore the hero worship from him, but he's having the same sorts of issues that Kate is. Some worries about the way that he looks. Apparently his mutation is more cat-like than I would have originally believed. Difficult for him, and he's scared about how Kate will handle it. His instincts are giving him problems as well. I'm not sure if I had the best advice for him about that, but I basically told him that he can't learn to deal with his instincts if he can't recognize them. Just hope I didn't step on Henri's toes with that one.

Henri...

The vial is open. Apparently Sinister keyed it to my own powers, so it couldn't be opened otherwise. Bastard. Well, Henri has it now, and apparently the matter inside it is mine. I haven't heard anything more about that yet.

Is it wrong of me to wish that I could have Ian up in my room on some nights of the week? Probably.

Should start getting plans set in motion. Need to talk to Grace and Lotte, do some shopping. I told Ian that he'd know it the night we would have sex, and damn it, he's going to.

Things seem to be going pretty well, all in all. The students are buckling down in classes. Even Timothy seems to pay attention in class. Well, French class, at least. Had a little trouble in the first dance class, but that seems to have worked itself out. And I think Katie's doing better in math since I started tutoring her. She should be ready for the next level next year.

I owe Emma, big time. She let Ian hear my voice on Wednesday. I could see what a big deal it was to him, and I was happy that I asked Emma to do it. Need to find a gift, but what do I give her? Well, other than Scott, which I can't do. And at this point, I'm not sure she'd take him anyway.

Ian and I have slept together. No sex. Not even sexual touching, just...slept. I don't think I've slept that well in years. I'm fairly certain he hasn't. But it was nice. One of these days, I have to cook for him. I'll even pay to get Lotte out of the apartment. Not that I have a problem with Lotte in the least. It's just...I tend to go a little overboard with the romance when I'm just cooking for two.

Other than that...well, there's one thing. Something I've been trying to avoid thinking about too much.

I let Jean into my head to see what happened. Well, I don't normally like having telepaths in ther (reminds me of Sinister), but she was able to clear away a lot of the emotional stuff that came with my empathy coming to the fore. Including the fact that Sinister basically set me up. He knew where I was and sent Grey Crow to point me to him. No idea what he planned to do with me, but it scares me.

Reminds me, though. I should get hold of Henri and see if he's found out anything about the vial. Maybe that's what he wants to talk to me about. We haven't been able to catch up yet.</lj-cut>"

So. I talked to Rogue. She's...upset. Understandably. I wish there was some way I could make it better for her. That I still love her but--God, we never work out. Seattle should have taught me that. Anyway, I guess she ended up talking to Bobby. Which is good. Bobby knows us both almost better than we know ourselves. If anybody could listen to her and really understand, it would be him.

A few days later, I got to talk to Ian. Right after his first ASL class. He was so nervous I could practically feel it across the room, and I know he wasn't projecting. It was just that obvious. When we talked afterwards, I was actually afraid that he'd turn me away. That I'd have gone through all that for nothing. But he didn't. Hell, he was overjoyed about the prospect of going out with me. That's a little new. Rogue was so hard to convince to go out on a date, and Belle...well, we knew each other too early for anything to even be considered dating. So, I said I'd take him out Friday after the dance class was over.

Class went fine. Dancing and being able to move my body are things that I'm very used to. I borrowed one of the cars and took Ian off into the city for dinner. Where I proceeded to make a fool out of myself. This is the first time I've ever dated a man, so I'm not sure what the rules are. I went to pull out Ian's chair for him, like I would anybody I was dating, just at the same time that Ian was pulling it out as well. Damned chair nearly went flying across the room. I blushed. I know I blushed. It's going to take some getting used to.

Dinner was nice and the food was good. I'd gotten the recommendation from a client in the city. I'm sure Scott would love to hear that. Anyway, conversation was sporadic, but I could tell that Ian was making an effort to speak. Unfortunately, the damned restaurant was busy and loud and Ian's always so worried about how loud he is. It was difficult to hear him most of the time, but I wasn't about to ask him to speak up. Next date, I think we'll go somewhere quiet. Or somewhere we can at least get a private table in the back, away from everyone else.

After dinner, I drove him home. He didn't invite me up, which is okay given his roommate. Not that I have anywhere to speak from when it comes to what Lotte did, but I doubt that she'd be all that interested in seeing one of the X-Men right now. Let her get back on her feet first.

Then Ian dropped the bombshell, wondering if I would stay over next time. He was very careful to emphasize that it would only be to sleep. I told him that I would need to think about it. He said that was all right, but I could see the hurt in his eyes. He's so accustomed to being used, to not being turned down when he offers his body... He holds himself so cheaply. He doesn't understand that sex isn't the only thing two people can have together. And I need to work on that. Until he can see that I can know about him and still care for him, he'll think that sex is the only way to get the closeness he desires.

All right, I could feel that he didn't really want sex. Not really with that offer. Which is the only reason I'm even considering it. Not on the next date, though. He understands and respects a no from other people. I've got to see if he can learn to say no on his own, though."

I've been thinking a lot lately. I know I usually do it here, but I couldn't make myself face what I was thinking about in such stark terms as black ink on paper.

I care about them both so much, but I'm hurting them both as well. And Grace pointed out, I'm hurting myself too, though I don't tend to think of it like that. But it's true. I'm having nightmares about Paris. I haven't had dreams about it since Creed was housed in the Mansion and he told Rogue. Only now, instead of Genevieve and Henri, I'm seeing Rogue and Ian. I only catch one, but...I don't know who it is. I wake up before I see who is at the end of the rope that I've caught.

I'm going to let one of them down. The only thing I know is that it won't kill either of them. They aren't really falling from the towers of Notre-Dame. It's just my mind's way of forcing me into a decision, or my subconscious's way of working through the problem.

I hate my subconscious.

I've tried listing pros and cons, making lists of what I like about them each. And as much as I care about them both, it seems to come down to two things: touch and need.

Henri, my brother, always told me that I had a damsel-in-distress complex. I'd sell my own soul to protect someone in trouble, especially women or children. When I arrived here, Rogue...needed someone. Someone to care enough to look past the long sleeves and the gloves, to see that there was someone wonderful beneath them. And...okay, I'll admit it. It took a while for me to do it. I looked at her as a pinch: something that I couldn't have, therefore I wanted it. But in wanting it, I got to know her, and that made the difference. She wasn't a pinch anymore, but a woman and someone that I wanted to be with. Except I'm an idiot and when we kissed in Israel...I lost her. And it's taken all this time to get her back.

I loved her. I still love her. I think I always will.

With Ian, things are different. He made things easy on me. It wasn't a secret when we first me that he liked what he saw. I was...going a little mad at the time, I think, spending all my time out of the Mansion. Finding women and men to sleep with. I didn't want to stay with them, I just...I wanted. Maybe I wanted something to take the pain of Rogue out of my life. Maybe I was trying to bleed something out and couldn't find the way. But into that void came Ian, scared of his own abilities and scared of shielding. And that one night together, I felt a connection that I've never had with another person in my life. Ian is an empath and for a while, I forgot. I was able to just live in the moment again. It all crashed down on me the next day, but...now he's been back at the Mansion and

I care for him. And I wonder if maybe, just maybe, I could love him.

And then there's me, since Rogue insisted. She wants me to put myself first, and...I want to try. I keep putting off a decision because I don't want to hurt either of them, but I think my classes are starting to deteriorate and the strain may well be showing there. I don't know. I...

I'm never this hesitant. This uncertain. But I know that when I held Ian, it felt...good. It felt right. But I worry because...Rogue is an X-Man. She knows and understands the kinds of lives we lead. She understands when I get injured that it was for a good reason. Or, at least, for a reason.

Ian...Ian's normal, for lack of a better word. Deaf, mutant, gay, yes, but normal. There is a life for him outside of the Mansion. A place for him in the world that doesn't include Xs and spandex and codenames. He's an innocent and I want to protect him from that. And God, he needs to be protected. He needs someone to be there to hold him, to beat it into his head that he's a good person, that there are people who love and care for him and that he's accepted and...

I think, if Bobby or Kitty were to read this, they'd point and laugh. Because those are the things that I need, too. Which is what it comes down to: touch and need.

I think...I think I need Ian. And Ian needs me. But God, how do I tell Rogue?

Remy knew it was a dream. Nightmare, really. He remembered going to sleep, still thinking about the conversation that he'd had with Rogue. The choice weighed more heavily upon him than ever before.

It was hardly surprising, then, the venue that his mind chose to play the choice out upon. Paris glittered below the Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris. Remy could see the Seine to the south, below the tower that he stood on. The vista would have been beautiful if not for the other man who stood on the tower.

""See, LeBeau, it's real simple. You give me the pendant and I let them go.""

It was more memory than dream. It had really happened like this, when Remy was seventeen years old. Standing atop the southern tower, watching as Creed dangled the two people he had cared for most into empty space.

""Of course, I let them go and they fall."" Creed grinned wickedly. ""And you can only save one of them. That is, if you have both hands. So, toss the pendant here and we'll see how things fall out.""

For the first time, Remy looked to the two that Creed held. In reality, it had been his brother, Henri LeBeau, and a young woman named Genevieve Darceneaux that he had stolen the pendant from in the first place. He'd half been expecting them to be there in this dream as well. Instead, he was surprised to see two pairs of green eyes watching him: Rogue and Ian. His heart constricted, feeling the weight of the Cheating Star in his hand.

Creed's grin widened. ""Which is it going to be, LeBeau? Which one do you love more?"" A few inches of rope slid through his hands, drawing screams from both captives.

Logically, Remy knew who he should grab. Rogue was invulnerable. She could fly. She was superstrong and could be out of the ropes in only a moment. Ian would die if he dropped from this height. However, he couldn't get the dream to reflect this. He had one chance, and he could only save one of them. He tossed the jewel at Creed's feet, lunging past him. Maybe, just maybe, if he moved fast enough...

It wasn't to be. Creed blocked him just a moment too long as he let the ropes go. Remy's fingers closed around only one of the ropes. He looked down from the tower, catching sight of wide, panicked green eyes...

...and jerked awake in bed, breathing hard and clenching his teeth. His jaw ached from holding back a scream. Turning over, he jammed a pillow down on top of his head, trying to block out the dream and trying not to think about the fact that he had chosen one over the other.

He just wasn't sure who.

Even with Mystique under wraps, Hatcher is still a mutant-hating bastard who would have put that legislation through anyway. I don't know if this is actually going to change anything.

Then again, Cyke and Emma took the president out to the drop-off point themselves, so who knows what happened? I don't think Cyke would condone of Emma doing something to the President's head, but Emma's sly and could have done it without his knowing. Maybe.

I can almost agree with Emma, though. Anything to keep the students safe.

Managed to get out of the fighting with two cracked ribs and a whole hell of a lot of bruises. It's making sitting interesting. It's also making standing, leaning, sleeping, walking, getting dressed--just about anything that requires movement or bending--VERY interesting. You never know how much you use some muscles until you've injured them.

Jean got more seriously injured. She's still down in the infirmary. I'll have to go down and at least stick my head in, say hi. If I can catch her without Cyke around. According to Henri, that might be more challenging.

Bobby's coming home. God, I miss Ice-for-brains. Not that I'm going to tell him that. Much.

On a completely different note, had a very uncomfortable dinner with Ian and Rogue in my room. Rogue brought up the last of the jambalaya and we were sitting on my bed, talking, when Ian showed up. The kids had apparently been back for an hour and he comes to see me at exactly the worst time possible. How's that for timing? I think he thinks there's something between Rogue and me still. I don't agree with him, though. Rogue and I will always be friends. We've been through too much, know too much about each other not to be. On the other hand, I don't think that we're ever going to get back to the place we were at before Seattle. Or maybe we can and I just don't want to get hurt again. Rogue is one of the few people I would have laid myself straight open for and she said no.

I...don't know that I feel the same way about Ian that I used to about Rogue. Or that I do feel about Rogue. Or...something like that. God, I'm writing myself around in circles now. I know that I care about Ian. I care about everyone in the Mansion. My teammates are as close as family. I call 'Ro my sister sometimes and it's a fairly good description of our connection. She says that she would follow me if I were made to leave. I believe her. Everyone else is closer to cousins, with some closer than others, of course. And the kids...I love the kids. I would anything to protect them and I can only hope that I keep having the chance.

But what if I do? I mean, care about Ian the same way that I did about Rogue. <s>That I</s> And herein lies the problem. I don't even know how I feel about Rogue. How can I figure out how I feel about Ian as well? I'm sounding like a damned teenager.

I need to give Ian an answer. He deserves better than to be waiting on me to try to wrestle this around. And, unfortunately, this all needs more than just a few days for me to think about. To come to terms with. I'll talk to him after class today. I'll tell him then. I'll always be his friend, but for now...for now, that'll have to be good enough.

The president is somewhere in the Mojave desert. Kitty got a lock on him. They're moving, but that's to be expected. Kitty will be with her Wisdom and Emma in Washington. The rest of us are going after the president.

I just want this done. I want to get back to life. I want to get back to teaching. That last...surprises me, quite a bit. I like the kids. I like having them around. It gets loud but...things are too quiet around here. April Fool's Day and no pranks. Nobody feels much like laughing and we need that right now.

I still don't know what I'm going to do about Ian, but...the letters are all written. One is there for him. If something happens to me, I at least want to let him know that it was all right. The kiss, I mean. I don't know about anything else.

Guess if I die tomorrow, anything else doesn't really matter, does it?

No. I won't think like that. Mattie said that things would be all right. She had Poppa send the bed and all. She said it would all work out. I trust her.

It will all work out.

It has to.</lj-cut>"

Remember what I said after Philadelphia? About it being the worst week ever?

Remind me to keep my big mouth shut.

So. Ororo, Kitty and Rogue all know. So does Cyke. Yes, I'm back to calling him Cyke because I don't feel right calling him 'Scott' any more. I know it's a distancing technique, same as the whole 'third person' thing that I do from time to time. I don't want to get hurt, but I know it's coming. Because this isn't something they can forgive and forget. And I don't want them to. I don't want forgiveness, just a chance to do the right thing.

Anyway, Cyke isn't dealing with it for the moment. I caught him half an hour before he told us that Charlotte (former student, was working with the Brotherhood) had revealed that President Hatcher...isn't President Hatcher. It's Mystique. The Brotherhood have had Hatcher since before the Inauguration. I feel bad for Rogue, finding this out. Mystique <s>was</s> <s>is</s> was her mother. If I suddenly found myself on the other side of a fight from Poppa or Mattie...I don't think I could do it. I don't think I could handle it half as well.

Rogue and I seem to be doing all right. Two conversations in a week that haven't sent either of us running the other direction. It's nice. Like we're really teammates instead of just existing in the same house. Friends. Not anything else. Too soon for that. And I think we've both changed too much since Seattle. We have to figure out where we stand on our own before anything else. <s>And Ian</s>

The kids are out of the Mansion for Break. I'm glad of that. It means that the rest of us can worry about what's coming up. Grace, Jane, Becca and Jade took the kids that would have been staying at the Mansion and they've gone to see Christine. Ian followed them. Guess Emma never quite got around to telling him that plans had changed and--

Fuck. Ian. I've been trying not to think about him. Because I don't understand. He came up here to say goodbye last night and...he kissed me. Before he left, he kissed me and said that we wouldn't talk about it again. How the hell am I supposed to deal with that? He's not an idiot. He knows something is going to go down this week. He knows that the kids were evacuated as much as just going for break. Told me to take care of myself. You'd think he'd know better. I've been at this a long time. It's not like I'm walking into the unknown. Why would he...

Billy.

Damn it. How am I supposed to deal with this?"

Week. From. Hell.

Weekend from hell, more like. I spent the week leading up to Saturday in conference with Kitty and David, trying to get things settled for the strike on MAMA. Last Thursday, Scott calls the team together to say that part of the team is going to Philadelphia to handle something with the Brotherhood. Kitty and I have to stay behind because we're already busy Saturday. Could have waited, but I'll tell the truth: I was just as glad not to go. Given the nightmares that seeing Sabertooth set off last time, I'd just as rather be able to sleep again. I'm a selfish bastard, we knew this already.

Bobby left Thursday. Apparently Charlie needs him in Genosha. Bastard didn't even ice my sheets to say goodbye. I'll get him when he gets home. And I'll forget his birthday too.

The raid on MAMA went well enough. David got called away in the middle of it, but by that point Kitty and I were pretty much where we needed to be at the time. We got out all right and that was all she wrote on that.

While we were out, though, the school was attacked by that Swarm guy from the Inauguration. He stung Kate, who is apparently allergic. Poor kid could have died and she's beating herself up because she brought him into the house. Apparently he stole something. Have to remember to ask someone what it was. Anyway, I think she talked it through all right with me. Feeling better at least.

Yes, I'm a hypocrit. I'll listen to anybody else and tell them to talk their problems out. Not me, though. Sometimes I hate myself for that. Most of the time, though, I have better things to hate myself over.

Anyway, found out on Saturday that things didn't go well in Philadelphia at all. The ambushers became the ambushees and frankly got their collective asses handed to them. Scott and 'Ro were both seriously injured which is why we haven't had a proper debriefing yet. Scott is still in the infirmary. Gotta remember to get down there and see how he's doing. I don't like being down there, but I can put that aside for a little bit to at least say hi. <s>Really hate the smell. Reminds me too much of Essex's labs.</s>

Turns out, though, that the world is very small. The detective that Scott hired to investigate in Philadelphia is none other than Gossamer. Friday, I suppose I should call her. Haven't seen the woman in a year. Figured I'd never see her again once I got news about Mickey's burning. And she shows up in the infirmary. Small, small world. Badgered me into getting her a long-handled woodedn spoon to scratch her back. Makes me glad for the eyes. Could have gotten it much worse.

On other fronts...Ian is a smart boy, right? I mean, he's not an idiot. But he doesn't understand how the people around here can care for him. I watch him struggling with it and just want to throttle his mother. I know I have issues with people caring for me, but I grew up on the streets, abandoned or stolen before I knew my parents. He grew up with parents who should have loved him and could have made sure he didn't want for anything. Instead, all that woman did was show how disappointed she was in a deaf son who couldn't fit in. God, let me remember that pained look in his eyes when I have children. I will never, EVER make that same mistake.

It makes me glad for Jean-Luc. His present has arrived, and it's not what I was expecting. He sent the four-poster bed from my room at his home. The first real bed I ever slept in. I'm scared to put it together, though. Mattie sent a letter that things would turn out all right, but...no. What happened to me in those tunnels is a secret. I can't tell them. They'd hate me, and I don't think I can handle that.

Haven't seen Rogue around lately. Hope she's doing all right.</lj-cut>"

"event","Around lunchtime on Thursday, the general routine of the school is disrupted by a van looking for a Mister LeBeau to take delivery of a package. By the time the van pulls up to the steps, Remy has been found and is waiting, if confused. ""Who's de package from, homme?""

The driver looks down at his paperwork. ""A Jean-Luc LeBeau."" He has the standard New York accent, the bored look of a man who has done these things too many times. ""Came with some letters too."" Those he hands over before going to the back of the truck and helping his partner unload several carefully wrapped, if oddly shaped packages onto the porch.

Frowning, Remy opens the first of the letters. Unsurprisingly, it is both handwritten and French.

<lj-cut text=""Dear Son""><i>Dear Son,

These past few months, I have not been able to forget the look on your face when we spoke at Christmas. I know that you miss the City, but I could see that you longed to be back in Westchester with your friends. Your team. I'm not certain that even you realized at the time how much you missed them.

When I suggested the gift to Mattie, she agreed. She said that it would be good to have a bit of your old home in your new home. Know that it comes with all my love for you, Remy. Even if you don't write often enough for this old thief's peace of mind.

Your loving father,

Jean-Luc</i></lj-cut>

Damn. He'd been hoping he hadn't been that obvious. Remy smiled slightly, watching the growing pile of packaging with a feeling of growing expectation. He turned to the second letter. It was shorter, though in French as well.

<lj-cut text=""Dear Remy""><i>Dear Remy,

Home is where you make it, child, and those who truly care for you will accept more than you believe.

You have become a good man, Remy. It will work out.

Mattie</i></lj-cut>

His hands shook as he folded the letter away. Trust Mattie to know what was on his mind, even so far away. He wasn't sure he believed her, but it was reassuring no matter what.

He tucked the letters away in his slacks, retrieving his wallet and tipping the delivery people quite well. Then he turned to the packages and wondered just what had possessed his father to send <a href=""http://www.custommade.com/gallery/HouseofLafontaine/fourposter-bed.html"">his old bed</a> up from home anyway.

I've gotten in the habit of drawing a card in the morning to see how the day is going to go. My own private horoscope, as it were. Not really any more reliable, but hell, why not, right? Most people don't even know that playing cards can be used for fortune telling and part of the reason why I keep a full deck at my bedside. Taking out anybody who breaks in is just a side benefit.

Today, for some reason, I get the urge to do a three-card spread. Now, Tante Mattie taught me early on that nobody worth their salt does a proper reading for themselves. You want a proper reading, you go to someone else, preferably someone who doesn't even know you all that well or whom you only know through such things. So, I pull the three cards in order and...the spread is interesting.

--Past: 4 of Clubs
I wasn't on the watch and got caught off guard by someone dishonest, or followed someone with blind acceptance.
I don't have to think very hard to figure out what this is referring to. Moving on.

--Present: 5 of Spades
Opposition and obstacles that are temporary, a blessing in disguise. Could also be a negative or depressed person.
I'm actually not exactly sure what this one means. The only obstacles in my life right now are...well, it's not exactly temporary. Even if I could get past it and actually talk to <s>Rogue</s> somebody about it, I don't think it would be temporary. This sort of stuff just isn't temporary.

--Future: Ace of Hearts
Indicates trouble and problems lifting, love and happiness.
Not exactly sure how happy I am to see this card. I've destroyed in before, in the middle of a card game because I couldn't allow myself to win off a royal in Hearts. That was...not long after Seattle, back when I was still trying to prove to everyone that I was all right with what happened. I doubt it has anything to do with her in particular, but the Ace of Hearts also has to do with the home. Maybe it means I'll actually find one.

It's an odd spread. Hopeful, really, considering the event that it's stemming from. Maybe it's trying to tell me that I need to talk things out. Got to take some time to consider this.

In other news, though, Kitty and I are going to be hitting MAMA's offices this weekend. Took longer to get around to than I had hoped, but she's brought David on board to help. Definitely a good idea since it means leaving fewer things around where they can find them.

Shopping went well with Ian and Katie. Got talked into a few things I probably shouldn't have, but it's not like I don't have the money for it. Though I think Ian and I may have confused the hell out of a few of the sales people. Actually, it may just have been me. I spent most of the day flirting shamelessly with Ian and with the salesladies. It was fun, and I got some gifts for people at the Mansion. Mostly little things, but I got Ororo a couple of nice silk scarves. She deserves them. Besides, she's like my little sister. I'm allowed to spoil her, right?

The nightmares have abated for the time being, set aside by a solid week of good sleep. Though I hear that Scott may now be having a few of his own. I have no idea what Jean did, but I'm sure it was good.

Haven't talked to Rogue since the eighth, though I saw her for a few minutes at the Valentine's dance. I think she's avoiding me.

I think I'm glad she's avoiding me.

I think that's probably not the healthiest reaction to the avoidance that I could have.

I don't know what I think anymore.</lj-cut>"

Heard anything from Forge yet?

Also, can't do this tomorrow or Saturday night. I've been talked into chaparoning Ian and Kate on a shopping trip. They can't leave campus without a faculty member and FL practically volunteered me, from what I understand. Okay, Ian's word was 'suggested', but you and I both know what that means when talking about Scottie.

Scott,

Remember that offer you made about kicking some ass in the Danger Room again? I want to take you up on it. I'll be up for whatever you want to plan.

Also, you need to find a few moments to talk to Timothy. Something about wanting to take Kate to the movies.

Hey, you still alive? Haven't seen you around, though I hear Economics is still going on so it can't be that bad. Come by for a drink or something so we can chat.

Well, Kitty and I have spoken with Scott. He's given us the go ahead to check out MAMA. Didn't look too happy about it. Guess I can't blame him. If we didn't need to know what we're up against and what they're planning, I would never have suggested it. But we do need to know about what they are doing, where they're getting their funding and if they are watching the school. Those cameras out there make me nervous. I'll have to ask Ororo if she can make sure the night we go out is overcast.

The Valentine dance was fun. The kids had a great time, which is what was important. Went as Aladdin. Saw Rogue. She looked nice. She...

I don't even know what's going on between us anymore. She actually flirted with me while I was making dinner for Mardi Gras. It didn't last long, though. I couldn't just let her keep going when she was the one who made the 'teammates' rule.

I still love her. But she's had access to my darkest secrets. And that's more than a little scary, because I don't know if they're still rattling around in her head somewhere. How would I even know?

I've talked to Henri and gotten some pills to help me sleep. I looked the drug up online and the side effects don't seem to be that bad. Drowsiness and some memory loss, but that's only while you're supposed to be asleep anyway. I'm just as glad to know that if I'm still having nightmares, I'm not remembering them. And I'm not falling asleep in my classes, which was why I had to go to Henri in the first place.

Suppose I should just talk to someone. Maybe I'll just e-mail Scott and see if he wants to hit the Danger Room. Need to remember to ask him to talk to Timothy about that movie thing.

Just looked at the calendar and realized that there's only nine days until my birthday. Or, at least, as close to my birthday as I'm ever likely to know. Not that I ever celebrated it much when I was young. Fagan would clap me on the back, remind me that I was a year older that day and send me out to lift wallets. That was the life of a pickpocket, after all.

I never really wondered if it was the right day until I was adopted, though. Father knew Fagan, of course. Fagan had once been a member of the Guild. I guess that's how Father found out about my birthday.

I don't know what I had expected when I woke up on the day that I turned eleven. Another pat on the back and off to work, which included more than picking pockets by that point. I was a LeBeau, and that meant learning more than simple hustling and grifting. What I found...my God, even now I find it hard to believe that someone could care so much about a child that they had newly taken in.

Gifts were still kind of new to me. Christmas had only been a few months before and I hadn't really understood it then either. Even though Fagan would make sure we had clothes and shoes, they were never gifts. He never just gave them to us. But coming downstairs to see Henri and Mercy, Father and Tante Mattie and Cousin Lapin--I didn't understand. All that, just for getting a year older?

I remember that Tante Mattie gave me a fountain pen. She was still teaching me how to write and she thought that the new pen would help. Henri (God, I still miss him) and Mercy gave me clothes and books. I probably could have done without the books, but Mattie was teaching me to read too. I wouldn't go to school until the next year when I was all caught up with the other students.

It was Father's gift that cemented everything. That made me feel as though I was truly among family. He gave me my colors. It was my first uniform, the one I was to use in my training. He explained that every thief got their uniform when they were eleven. Just because I hadn't been with them as long as the other children didn't mean that I shouldn't have the same considerations. I was family, so he had held by family tradition.

I don't think he ever realized just how much that uniform meant to me. Maybe that's the reason I stood by it so long. And maybe that's why I'm finally to the point where I can go to the one that Scott has for us. I don't need to be reminded that I belong with the thieves and with Father. Sometimes, though, I do need to be reminded that I'm an X-Man.

The nightmares are back.

My mind has been pretty quiet for the past year. Once I figured out that Rogue really wasn't going to come back. I guess it was almost a kind of release for me. If she didn't come back, nobody would ever learn about what she'd seen. It didn't make them go away completely, but I didn't spend every night tossing and turning and waking up in a cold sweat.

At least they don't make me scream anymore.

Thing is...I can't even blame them on Rogue. I wouldn't, because they're my own creations, but they can't just trace to Rogue. I can trace them back to the students, mostly. We have around thirty students at the school right now. Every single one of them knows about the X-Men and what we do. A good half of those students want to be X-Men themselves once they have their powers under control. Worse, they look up to us as some sort of idols. Role models.

It scares the ever-loving shit out of me.

They don't know me. They don't know the things that I've done. Hell, the X-Men don't even know the things that I've done. But I'm no hero.

I remember those tunnels. In my dreams now, it's not just those I know were killed. I see the entire team dead, but not just them. The students are there too. Katie. Timothy. Jubilee. Eddie. All of them wearing the X. All of them in those damned tunnels.

He's there too, in the dreams. Comes up behind me just when I find Rogue, her eyes still open and accusing. He reminds me that it's my fault that they are dead. I led his men there, after all. It's my fault.

I'm sorry, chere.

I need to clear my head. Maybe some time in the Danger Room will help sort me out. Besides, I need to get that new uniform stretched out somehow.</lj-cut>"

"event","Who: Friday O'Reilly and Remy LeBeau
Where: Mickey Finn's Pub
When: A year and a half ago (in other words, backdated like WHOA...)
What: One mutant private detective. One heartbroke Cajun thief. First meetings.

<lj-cut text=""To the days when things were far more simple."">
Mickey Finn's is an old-fashioned kind of place. Wood rafters, thick wooden tables and a large bar off to the far side of the room serve to immediately give it a comforting atmosphere. A few rugs are scattered on the hardwood floor; age has worn off any designs and the general color scheme appears to have been reddish. A fireplace stands beyond the large bar, and tables are scattered in small clusters around the room. There is an air of a smoker's bar in the curtains. It is not an easy place to find, but it is not exactly hidden. Mickey himself is a large, burly man; a slightly balding redhead with a fierce mustache and kind blue eyes; with a penchant for smoking the most appallingly-smelling cigars in the world. 

Remy LeBeau is quite good at finding things that are hidden. Bars, however, are sometimes his forte. And right now, the Cajun thief needs a drink or five to stave the heartache and the guilt for another night. Maybe it's the smell of the cigars that draw him. They really aren't any worse than what Logan smokes, after all. He steps inside, looking a bit odd in his dark clothes, trench coat and sunglasses. No Logan. Oh well, he doesn't need anybody to drink with. Walking to the bar, he pulls out his wallet and drops a twenty on the bar. ""Bottle of bourbon, s'il vous plait.""

There are quite a few people scattered about in the bar. An odd mix of mutants and non-mutants; there is a polite nod from one or two of them, or a bit of a glance at the stranger that appears at the door, but nothing else. There is an old piano in the corner, being banged on my an ugly, scrawny fellow doing his best Hoagie Carmichael impression. A freakishly tall man sits at a table playing  cards with three short and buxom triplets, a priest sits beside the fireplace with a table full of laughing people, holding a smoke-ring contest. All in all, it is a quietly congenial place. At the bar sits a man who seems to be one of those mile-long-legs sort, skinny as a beanpole, and on the other side sits someone dressed in a large trench coat and a fedora, with a lot of reddish fur sticking out of places. A long cigarette seems jammed between the person's teeth. Mick nods, and gets him a bottle and a clean glass, setting it down on a napkin in front of Remy.

""Merci, monsieur."" Remy nods, taking the glass and bottle and leaving the twenty behind. He doesn't need the change, after all. He looks around, trying to find a good place to sit. His eyes drift over the triplets for a moment but he shakes his head. The priest isn't any better, really. No need for the whole 'soul saving' thing. Besides, he's not much good at smoke rings. After a moment, he drifts toward his fashion twin. ""This seat taken?"" He leaves off any honorifics, not knowing if the trench coated person is male or female.

The bartender sweeps the twenty away with one massive hand, depositing his change with the other, and goes down to the other end of the bar to wait on someone, taking his god awful cigar with him. The person turns their head toward him, letting him see that the poor soul looks like a lovechild between a Wookie and a standard poodle. But the fuzz is a bit less dense on the face, and friendly spaniel brown eyes look at him. ""Nope. It's all yours."" The voice is female, and he can sort of see that through the shoulders as well. ""Name's Friday."" She nods politely to him.

The name gets a cocked eyebrow. ""Dat de first or last? 'Cause if it is de last name, I pray dat your parents didn' name you Josephine."" Hey, he likes to watch reruns of Dragnet. He does take the seat. ""Name's Remy, so dat we got de niceties out of de way.""

She huffs a laugh, switching the burning cigarette to the other side of her mouth with a flash of white teeth. ""First name, though there's nothing better than Dragnet. Unless it's the Rockford Files, maybe. Friday O'Reilly. Nice to meet you, Remy."" She extends a hand to shake his politely. ""Careful of the back of my hand---don't hurt yourself."" The back of her hand is covered with fur, but he can also see long shiny black lines sort of beneath the fur.

""Remy LeBeau."" His handshake his firm, fingers placed so that he doesn't get pierced. Though the spines do keep him from kissing her hand like he does with so many women. Releasing Friday's hand, he slides his sunglasses off to reveal those strange red-on-black eyes. ""Pleasure is all mine, cher. Though I did prefer Star Trek."" He opens the bottle of bourbon and pours a two-finger measure into the glass.

She shakes his hand with a polite, firm graps. The fur is not too weird, as far as those things go, and she is also very careful so as not to pierce him with the flat spines. ""Star Trek rocks,"" she agrees. ""The original, I mean."" She notices his eyes, definitely, but is a gent about it and raises her mug of Irish Coffee to him in a toast when he pours his bourbon. ""To the days when things were far more simple.""

""Oh, oui. I can definitely drink to dat."" He raises his glass and tinks it against hers. ""Simpler days."" Normally bourbon is a sipping drink. Remy, however, is not here for sipping. He tosses back about half the drink, shaking himself slightly as the warmth of the alcohol spreads down his throat. ""So,"" he says after a moment, ""what brings a lovely lady like you to a place like dis?"" It's actually not a pick-up line, no matter how husky the drink has made his voice. He's just curious now.

""Just lucky, I guess,"" she replies almost instantly to the age-old query. She takes a sip, licking the whipped cream carefully away from her upper lip. ""Mickey Finn's seems to be one of those places that you find as you need it, you know? A while back, I really needed it. Life's kind of rough when you wear your own fur coat. PETA people hate you. So, I came here and stayed for the company. How about yourself?""

""Dey're all nuts anyway."" His smile is charming. ""Me? Dis is my first time here. Needed to get 'way from de house for a while."" Away from thinking about Rogue, mostly. Seattle. His old life before he became an X-Man. Hell, away from being an X-Man. The rest of the glass is finished and he busies himself pouring another.

""It's a good place for that,"" she replies, nodding. ""There's a few things you might want to know about this bar. The big guy behind the bar? That's Mickey. He doesn't put up with any mooks that come here. No drug pushers, no slimeballs, no pimps, none of that. Mutants are welcome as long as they behave themselves like the rest are expected to. No bar fights, no squabbles. And most of all, no prying. If he thinks anyone's prying into someone else's business, he'll toss 'em out on their ear himself. If anyone wants t'talk about what's hurtin' them, they'll find that everyone here is ready to listen. 'Shared pain is lessened, shared joy increased'. It's written on the mirror over there, see?"" she points. ""But anyone and everyone is welcome here. To hide, or to be found.""

His eyes track to the saying above the mirror. It brings a smile to his face. ""Well, I don' do anyt'in' like drugs. Ain't a pimp."" Lips curl slightly, like he's stepped in something nasty. ""De slimeball...I t'ink my ex might 'gree wit' dat, but I would say she a bit biased."" Thinking of Belle prompts him to knock back his second drink. The entire glass this time. ""I promise I'll be good."" Amusement in his eyes this time, along with that slight fuzziness that comes with drinking a little too fast. Hiding sounds good right now anyway.

She nods as she watches him toss back his second drink, her gaze sharp. ""I think we all have exes that would agree with the 'slimeball' tag,"" she states casually. ""Yet here we are. Is that a N'awlins accent you've got? I went down there last year. Pretty place. The humidity raised hell with my hair, though.""

Remy is quite good at holding his liquor normally. He nods once. ""Oui. Born an' raised."" He sets his glass aside, giving himself a few minutes to deal with what's in his system before adding more. ""I love de city. She's a beautiful lady. I just don't get back dere too often. De ladies, sometimes dey ain't always to happy wit' Remy, hein?"" Which leads him back to Rogue and his hand twitches toward the glass, but he refuses at the moment.

""Sometimes it's hard t'go back to a place where you grew up. Too many changes on both sides."" She sips her coffee contemplatively, thinking about what he just said. ""Sometimes...sometimes not being happy with someone doesn't mean what a guy thinks it means. And sometimes, it means even worse things. Relationships can be a real pain in th'ass sometimes."" She stubs out her smoke into an ash tray, and sips at her coffee.

""I'd drink to dat, but I t'ink I need to spread myself out a bit better."" He raises an eyebrow, but remembers the rule about not prying, so doesn't ask the questions. ""Yeah. De last girlfriend, she don' trust me."" <i>She got good reasons too, swamp rat,</i> he reminds himself. ""De ex-wife...dat's a story in an of itself and I shouldn't bore you wit' it.""

She chuckles, and pulls out a battered pack of Luckies from the inside of her trench coat. From what he can see, fur everywhere. Rusty-red. She offers him a smoke from the pack before taking one for herself. ""In my experience, exes rarely trusted to begin with. Or else had it broken for a good reason, and everything goes to hell from that point on."" She pulls out a World War 2 lighter, and lights his smoke if he took one, then her own. ""Wouldn't bore me, Remy. Talking sports would bore me. But I'm not prying, mind. You may not see them easily, but I've got ears and know a thing or two about listening.""

He has his own smokes, but he'll never turn down a free one. He accepts the light and nods. ""It's complicated. See, her brother tried to kill me on de weddin' night. Den I had to leave N'awlins right away."" Basically thrown out of the Guild and New Orleans. He didn't even take the time to say good-bye to Belle. ""She come after me a couple years later and I t'ought she was dead. Foun' out later dat she's okay, but she don' 'member me."" He takes the cigarette from his lips and shakes his head. ""Ever won'er just what you did to get sucked into de soap opera?""

The fur on her face seems to move a bit in a sympathetic grimace. ""That's hard. Would asking questions by prying?"" Mickey, alerted by some sixth sense, looks over towards them. ""I often wondered what I did to be stuffed in this awful sitcom, myself.""

For a moment, Remy seems to think it over. Finally, he takes a deep breath and blows out the smoke. ""I'll tell you if de questions get too personal."" The more he looks at her, the more he gets that she seems to remind him of something. He can't seem to remember what it is just yet, though. He's sure it'll come to him, though.

She nods. ""Deal."" Mickey seems to relax, down at the other end of the bar. If she didn't remember you, why did she come after you a couple years later?""

""I don' t'ink I'm makin' much sense. She came after me for some help. I gave de help, but t'ought she died in de helpin'. It was after dat dat I found out she was alive."" And why she lost her memory is another thing that he really doesn't need to think about. He keeps his eyes away from the glass by force of will only.

She nods, understanding a bit more, and she nods. ""I get it. You'd already mourned for her loss, and then found out she was still alive. You had to deal with it all over again."" She sips at her coffee before it starts to get too cold. ""Is her brother still after you?""

""Non. He's dead."" Twice over. That would take too much time to tell too, so he leaves it at that.

She nods, looking at him for a long moment. ""Is this what's making you want to drink an entire bottle of bourbon tonight, Remy?"" she blows out smoke from the side of her mouth.

He raises an eyebrow, trying to decide if the question is too personal when things finally click. ""Gossamer."" Nonsequiter much?

Her brows go up, and she gives a flash of teeth again around that cigarette. ""Monsters are such <i>interesting</i> people. Only I'm not wearing sneakers, Cajun. If I am, better hide your rabbits.""

Remy tilts his head back and laughs. It feels good to do that again too. ""Non, cher. De rabbits, dey better for eatin' anyway, hein?"" He takes the cigarette from his mouth and taps off the ash. ""I know, it seems weird, but...I t'ink it's de hair.""

""Not so weird,"" she replies, taking a deep drag on her smoke. ""Since it's reddish and covers me, I mean. I just thank my lucky stars that my head isn't shaped like the top of a heart, or I'd have offed myself a long time ago."" She gestures for Mickey's attention for another Irish Coffee, and glances to Remy. ""Want to try an Irish Coffee? Make your bourbon last?"" Mickey appears and gets her coffee, looking to Remy to see if he wants one.

""Be a shame to do somet'in' to so pretty a head, too."" Remy is Remy is Remy. He'll flirt, no matter what. ""Sure. Dat sounds good."" He nods to Mickey.

She gives another huff of a laugh, amused at the flirting reflex. Mickey nods and brings an Irish Coffee to Remy, laced with real whipped cream and Bushmill's. ""Your turn for a toast,"" she eyes Remy, holding her cup.

He mulls it over for a moment, then smiles slightly. ""To home. Wherever it might be.""

""Ahh. To home,"" Approval in her tone, and she nods firmly, clinking her cup to his before taking a sip. Ambrosia. ""May I ask what you do now, Remy?"" she asks after a moment or two of savoring the hot liquid.

The real warmth of the coffee is a nice counterpoint to the artificial warmth of the bourbon. He grins, the whipped cream giving him a bit of a mustache and absolutely clashing with those eyes. ""I'm in item reclamation."" In a way, it's very true. It's just that the items he's reclaiming haven't always belonged to the people he's claiming them for, that's all. ""An' I do some mutant rights stuff on de side."" Also true. Not that the professor might agree with the way he's phrased it.

She snickers, and nods. ""Mhm. 'Items reclamation'. I know a few people that are fairly successful in that venture."" She takes another sip, licking away the whipped cream, and leaning in towards him, speaking in a very soft whisper. ""And is the mutants rights thing separate from being an X-Man, or a part of it? Don't worry. Elvis Himself could walk in here and order a drink and nobody would call the press. Like I said, this place is <i>special.""</i>

His eyes slide to her for a moment after she asks. He shakes his head. ""Non. One in de same."" His shoulders relax a bit. It's kinda like Jake's, only better because the mutants can be more open. Salem Center is a lot of things, but open-minded isn't always one of them. ""An' I'm quite good at de reclamations, if I do say so myself."" Third best thief in the world, last he'd heard.

""It always pays to do a job well,"" she nods, sitting back on her stool, stretching her legs a bit. More fur. Ridiculously enough, flip-flops on her feet. ""Personal pride in a job well done is often the best reward....although moola doesn't hurt to grease the wheels, either.""

He's not sure if this friendship will ever go beyond a single night of drinks. He's not attracted to her. Too close to Rogue leaving (again) for him to even think about it. But if it ever does, Friday is SO getting a pair of sneakers from him. Just for laughs. ""A cher after my own heart.""

She grins, showing white teeth amidst the rusty fuzz. ""Hey, what's work without personal pride, you know? No sense in doing a job if you can't do it well...oh, which reminds me."" She pats her trench coat pockets, and pulls out a business card. ""Friday O' Reilly"" it states. There is a stylized drawing of an eyeball, complete with a fedora perched on top, and then an address and phone number. ""My card.""

Remy takes the card, raising an eyebrow. ""Friday O'Reilly, detective."" He chuckles, tucking it into the inner pocket of his trench coat. ""I'm 'fraid I don' got a card for eit'er job."" Since thieves don't advertise, and the X-Men normally don't either.

""Some jobs don't require them,"" she replies shrugging amiably. ""It's the way of the world. Never a nine to five thing, is it? The most fascinating things always seem to happen in the dead of night."" She takes another puff, and then blows out a smoke ring.

Remy stubs out the end of his cigarette, reaching for his own pack this time. Marlboro Reds, which he offers. ""Non. Never a nine to five t'ing at all. Eit'er one."" He's going to be yelled at by Scott for being out all night again, but he doesn't care at the moment. ""Al'ays been a night person myself. Prob'ly 'xplains why I never did dat well in school.""

She accepts with a nod of thanks, setting the smoke down. ""Always been a bit of a night owl, myself. I did okay in school, but really didn't apply myself much. Didn't see the need until it was too late. Something about the nighttime, though. Seems more tolerant than the day. Besides, I like to sleep in.""

""Well, mos' my skills didn' come from de school house."" Remy grins, sipping at his coffee again. ""An' de girls was more int'restin' dan what de teacher was sayin'."" Or he was simply thinking ahead to the pinch that night. With him, it could have been either.

""In other words, the typical things of a normal kid,"" she nods, smoking for a moment. ""I always tended to skip certain classes, which ended up biting me in the butt later on. But still. How can they expect kids to sit through geometry in spring?""

""Now, geometry I didn' mind so much, though I paid more 'tention in trig. Knowin' how to work out angles has helped me a lot in bot' jobs."" He also has an innate feel for angles, which helps him figure out card flights. ""I tended not to be able to sit still t'rough history or literature, myself.""

She nods, grunting a bit. ""Yeah, I never really thought about that much. But I can see how that'd happen. me, I was going to be a cop. I was always going to be a cop, ever since I can remember. So I paid attention to the things that I thought I'd need, y'know?"" She takes a long drag on her Lucky, letting the smoke curl up and around her head. ""But things happen. Life throws us curve balls.""

Remy nods, his smile a little crooked. ""Mais oui. It certainly does."" After all, who would ever think that a Cajun thief would find himself working the other side of things on the northern side of the Mason-Dixon line? Even if the group that he worked with wasn't exactly on the right side of the law, at least according to said law.

She takes another sip of her coffee, nodding a bit, sitting in a comfortable sort of slouch. She shifts her positioning a bit, crossing her ankles the opposite way, which reveals that she is wearing what truly appears to be a kilt beneath the trench coat.  ""Wonder what the next year will bring,"" she muses. ""Hopefully profit."" She gives an amused glance over to Remy.

Oh, is he ever easily amused. More easily when he's had alcohol, of course. The kilt gets a a raised eyebrow, but that's about it. ""Pfft. Profit. I'll be happy if de next year bring me fewer bruises.""

She snickers. ""I don't even bother hoping for that anymore,"" she replies. ""Or else I'd have to get used to disappointment awfully fast. Besides, profit is what makes nursing those excess bruises worthwhile, you know. It serves as a financial sort of balm.""  

""Don' worry 'bout dem anymore. 'Sides, never been good 'bout keepin' my resolutions anyway."" As evidenced by the fact that he's usually back in Westchester before February. ""I just start makin' de ones I know I can't keep, den I don' feel so bad when I can't.""

She looks at him for a moment, because they seem to be speaking about different things, and she grins with amusement. ""You're speaking of New year's resolutions?""

""Resolutions period, no matter when you make dem."" It's really a bit late in the year for New Year's Resolutions, but what the hell. Besides, if he's not tracking the conversation, he'll just blame it on the drinks later. ""De way I see it, dey just another reason to hope. You make a resolution and you hope it works out."" Remy, on the other hand, has little to no hope left, ever. Which is why he keeps making the resolutions he can't keep.

""So....are you saying you have no reason to hope?"" She's actually surprised.

Remy looks at her. He's looked so young most of the night, but he looks far older than his mid-twenties now. ""I'm a soldier, cher. Have been for a long time now. Been fightin' long enough, ain't sure there's a drop of hope left to me, because I done given it all away. Every fight is so dat someone else can keep deir hope alive."" He finishes off the coffee and frowns. ""Maybe someday, I'll find a reason to hope 'gain."" Damn it, he hates it when he gets like this. Usually if he's going to be this down, he's off on his own in the corner of a bar somewhere. Or, if he has to be with someone, it's usually Logan or Kurt, neither of which will try to draw him out.

It is impossible to tell how old she is. That maddening fur tends to cover things. She is silent for a moment, looking at him, and sipping her coffee. ""You will,"" she finally says. ""But it'll happen when you least expect it.""

His look moves to encompass the bar, then he stands. ""We'll see, Friday. For now, though, I t'ink dis Cajun best take his leave 'fore he starts bringin' de mood down, hein?"" He picks up the bottle of bourbon, already paid for, and sets another twenty down. ""You have a good night, Gossamer."" He smirks slightly. The name does seem to fit. At least, it fits her looks if nothing else.

""Didn't mean to chase you off, Remy,"" she replies. ""You have a good night, too. Don't forget where this place is, now."" She nods to him in a polite farewell, lighting up another cigarette.

""Don' worry. I ain't been chased off. Just...sometimes, I'm better off drinkin' alone."" He nods to her. ""I be 'round, cher. Count on it."" He pulls his glasses out and puts them on again before heading back out into the night. There had to be a dive hotel around here somewhere that he could sleep off the hangover he'd be getting after tonight.

She knows the 'drinking by yourself' routine all too well. A final nod, and she exhales the smoke in a long gray plume, before stubbing the cigarette out and getting ready to head out herself. An X-man, with no hope and a broken heart. That's a downer for sure.

Seems I always hit the roof when I need to think things out. Which is fine. I can smoke up here and nobody is going to give me grief. Hey, it's outside. Rules say that we can't smoke in the public places, so that means outside or our rooms and Cyclops really hates it when we smoke in our rooms.

I should start teaching classes next week. I think Emma wants to take the time that she would have been teaching French and apply it to helping the new telepath, Selene, fit in. Met the girl. She's nice enough. Doesn't seem to mind me in the least. Likes the eyes, so that's a help. She should about flip when she meets Becca, then.

Still not sure about this teaching thing. I mean, all right, I'm bilingual, but I'm pretty sure that nobody in France wants to admit that I speak French at all. I doubt it matters. The kids have probably all got insufferably high class accents by now anyway. I'll see what I can do about that.

Though speaking of the kids--and I'm even pretty sure which one it is--I was pranked on Friday. Finished watching TV downstairs and came back up to find my room filled with balloons. With baby powder and purple glitter. Got covered in it. Emma made a snarky remark about clapping her hands and believing in fairies, followed by a remark about her thinking I could be getting ready to go out with Ian. So I hugged her and she's definitely going to have to dry clean her outfit. Anyway, the prank is apparently part of some new prank war. All sorts of fun. So, I got Jean. Wrapped her room up in cellophane. Easier to clean up than mine was, I'll say that right now. Got to meet her cat, though. Cute gal.

The big news, though, has to do with Ian. Caught him giving Jane some dancing lessons. Rogue arrived sometime afterwards when I was giving Jane some pointers on tango. I think that between us, we may have made him happy for having his shields up. Not my intention, of course, but it happens with her far too often.

Anyway, I found him later and apologized for what happened. We had a long conversation, covering me and Rogue and why he ended up back here. He said what happened had felt like what happened when Billy died, so I have to wonder if maybe he got caught in a feedback loop with the guy he'd been with. I'm sure Emma's already thought of that and covered it with him. Maybe I'll ask next time we talk. We also talked about the fact that Bobby knows about us and that Emma probably knows about us. Not too comfortable with that, but...well, I suppose if she had a major problem with it, I'd have heard already.

The news, however, is that he projected on me. Not just projected, but controlled it so that I wasn't overwhelmed. He only did enough to affect my mood instead of just rolling me. It wouldn't have worked if my shields weren't down a bit so I could keep an eye on his. The first time was unconscious, I think, trying to make me feel better after mentioning Rogue. He controlled it the second time, in order to allow me to see what I feel like to him. He said that everyone has a different 'feel', which to him is nearly tactile. <strike>I can't</strike> If that was what I felt like to him, if that's what the world feels like to him, I can understand why he doesn't like to shield. Not that I'm going to let him get away with not shielding.

<strike>I want</strike> I hope that I was able to help him today. Not just with the projection. He needs to know that he can come and talk to <strike>me</strike> someone when he needs to. He's making good progress, though. I just hope he will keep it up.

Just got to keep him out from between Rogue and me. Especially if Rogue's going to do things like call him 'cher'. Now that's unnerving.</lj-cut>"

Mutie.

As insults go, it's rather tame. It's not even very creative. And believe me, when you grow up in a culture based around two languages, you learn some creative insults.

So why does that one word anger me so much? And I was angry. Very much so. I just worked not to show it to Jade or those men at the bar. Maybe I'm mad because those assholes just had to take it the one step further. It wasn't enough to insult Jade's hair. It wasn't enough to just stare and be openly rude. They had to call her a mutie.

And maybe that's my problem. It wasn't me they were insulting. I can take epithets like that all day. 'Mutie' doesn't seem so bad when compared to 'the white devil' or even 'demon child'. It's just a word.

A word that five men wanted to use as justification for beating the snot out of Jade, Logan and myself. In general, bad choices to want to fight. They're all still alive. The problem is that 'Mutie' will be the justification in the news tomorrow when they're talking about three of those men getting their asses handed to them. And the news won't mention that those rednecks attacked first.

Damn but I hate people some days.

In other news, I've put my foot in my mouth with Rogue. Again. As usual. Called her 'cher'. I shouldn't, I know. I have no right to be calling her anything like that. She ran. Predictable, really. Can't blame her.

Met up with one of the other students. Timothy. Good nose. Thought the squirrels were raising an army to attack the Mansion, I think. Well, I doubt that, actually. But he seems to be a good enough kid. Except for the hero-worship I see in his face. Of course, these kids don't know that I'm no hero. Not really.

Scott wants me to teach French. The man is psychotic.

<lj-cut text=""Dear Tante Mattie"">
Dear Tante Mattie,

I know. I should have written earlier. This last week and a half has been the week from hell and I've only now been able to catch a breath.

I'm sure by now you've heard about what happened at the Inauguration. Yes, I was there. No, I wasn't injured. None of us were, thankfully. Too many people were, though. I think it's keeping us all up nights. Add to that that the Mansion was picketed while we were in Washington and the students are fairly buzzing with energy and nerves. It's enough to drive a body crazy. In other words, life is about normal here.

How is the city? The Guilds trying to kill each other yet? Again? Is it strange that I miss New Orleans when I am here, but miss here just as much when I am there? Maybe it's not so strange. I've drifted for so long, maybe it just seems strange for my heart to have settled anywhere.

I'm enclosing a letter for my father as well. It'll get to him faster from your hand than it would by post and having to pass through so many hands before it reaches him. I would appreciate it greatly, as I have always appreciated everything you've done for me, Mattie.

Love,

Remy</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Dear Father"">
Dear Father,

I know that I should write more often. However, I rarely seem to have a moment to myself these days to sit down and actually write. I shall try to do so more often.

If you saw footage from the Inauguration, you know that the X-Men were there, as was I. Nobody is injured, thankfully. What happened that day is bad enough. There was also a protest at the Mansion, which scared the students. Things seem to have mostly settled, though, which is a good thing for my nerves. Been jumpy as hell, honestly. Not a good thing for a thief, as I'm sure you know.

I guess there really isn't much of a point to this letter, is there? I know Mattie would have told you if something had happened to me. I don't understand how she knows the things she knows, but she does and I accept that. I just needed to let you know for myself that I'm all right and still kicking.

Your son,

Remy</lj-cut>"

Need to write some letters home to Father and Tante Mattie. Mattie, I'm sure, knows that nothing is wrong, but she'd prefer to be assured of that. She is almost like a mother to me. Sometimes I think she even forgets that I'm not kin.

I'm still not sure what I'm feeling about the inauguration. I mean, Hatcher's still a bastard, but he's alive. That's what we set out to do, right? Except that five other people were killed. In the end, it doesn't really matter. We're all being crucified because we tried to stop the assassins. That the assassins were mutants as well only makes it all worse.

Got drunk with Bobby and Kitty. Is it sad when Bobby's love life is going better than mine? I think it is. Not that Grace isn't a perfectly lovely girl. But I'm worried about Bobby. He came and talked to me last night and there's something wrong. I don't know what it is, but he seems to be having some issues connecting with Grace. Hell, connecting with anybody right now. Nothing I can help him with, unfortunately. I'll give him some time, then I'll talk to Jean about it. It feels a lot like prying, but...I don't want to see anything happen to him.

I told Bobby about Ian and me last year. Probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life...but only because he was a student. He was MY student. Position of authority and all that shit. Then again, he's...what? A year younger than me? It doesn't FEEL like a position of authority. I think of him as a kid, but I sometimes wonder if I think that because it lets me feel guilty about it. He was 24. He was old enough to make his own decisions.

Christ, that doesn't really make me feel better about it.

As for Ian, I've got other reasons to beat my head against a wall about him. He's projecting. Completely uncontrollably. I keep thinking over everything last year and there's nothing. No real clues except what was in his file. And the file--everyone knows that file. We've all seen it if we were here last year. He first manifested by projecting. Any of us should have guessed that he would start projecting again. Of course, I was the one with experience in that power. <strike>I should have</strike> No. Let that go. It's in the past. I need to move on to help him find a way to control it. Though I should leave that to Emma, I suppose.

In other news, I spoke with Rogue. We're talking again. Kinda. Teammates. It's something. More than I deserve, less than I might want. She's smoking now. Wonder when she started that...</lj-cut>"

Where: Outside the window to Remy's room
When: Several drinks after Kitty and Bobby left
What: A little bit of talk ends in a tentative agreement

<lj-cut text=""Look, t'aint gonna do either of us any good, ain't gonna do the house any good, us bein' like this."">
Just another round around the mansion, then she'd go back in. Really. Rogue was just about to turn the corner to the back of the school when she caught a faint red glow coming from one of the windows and had a sudden craving for a cigarette. She'd flown closer before she realized who it was likely to be, but she was well within his sight now. ""Shit,"" she said softly.

Remy was sitting in his window, one leg on the sill, the other one still in the room. He drew in a breath, the cherry on the cigarette burning brighter for a moment before he took it out to knock off the ash. He looked up at Rogue, squinting a little, as though his eyes weren't quite focusing. His expression turned faintly resigned before he nodded. ""Bonsoir, Rogue."" Just Rogue. Not cher, not petite, not even Roguey. Just Rogue.

She couldn't fly away now. ""Bonsoir Remy,"" she said with a nod. She moved a little closer, and she could practically smell the odor of liquor rolling off him. His room was quiet. Either Kitty and Bobby had fallen asleep or left. She waved a hand toward his cigarette. ""You got 'nother one of those?""

That gets a raised eyebrow in response. ""When you start smokin'?"" That wasn't a no, though, as evidenced by the fact that he picked up his pack (right by his foot) and shook one out. He held it out for her, as far away from himself as he can. He's not expecting her to come any closer than she has to, after all. ""I got a lig'ter in here. Somewhere."" Accent is thicker tonight. Probably the alcohol.

Rogue approached to take the cigarette from him with a small shrug. ""Just seemed to have picked it up,"" she said, casting a glance at the windowsill for a lighter. ""I should quit, don't want to be a bad example for the kids."" She glanced in the room. No Kitty, no Bobby. A bottle of bourbon within reach. 

Remy snorted slightly, putting his head back against the window jam. ""So should I. Don' t'ink it's gonna happen anytime soon."" Because they're all examples for the kids. And it wasn't like he was out getting drunk in front of them. The lighter turned out to be right next to Remy's foot as well. He shifted away slightly when she nears, bending over inside of the room. He came back up with a glass, one with a good measure of the bourbon in it, having switched from vodka a few drinks ago. Even so, he wasn't quite far gone enough to drink straight from the bottle.

She lit up, pulling back slightly to give him his space, left arm wrapped around her as she smoked. She watched him drink, unsure of what to say, or do. She'd promised to be civil, didn't mean she had to be friendly. Rogue smoked silently, keeping half an eyes on the grounds, half an eye on him.

""Sorry 'bout de War Room de ot'er day."" He didn't look at her, staring down into his drink. ""I was outta line."" She probably never would have expected something like that out of him. He took a long drink, draining about half the glass in one swallow before he turned to look at her. ""Dis ain't gonna be easy for ya, but I'll try not to make it any harder.""

""You made a good point,"" she said grudgingly. She floated a little closer and reached for the bottle, tilting her head back as she swallowed, enjoying the burn. She set it back down on the windowsill deliberately, as if she were turning over a shot glass. ""I promised Scott and Bobby I'd be civil,"" she said. She wasn't goin' to say 'thank you.'

""Merci."" He can say thank you. He knew he was the one in the wrong, after all. The dark look to his eyes may bring to mind memories of the things that drive him to drink like this. Heartache, though in the memories she has it's mostly centered around Belladonna. Rogue, after all, wouldn't know how bad he was the night they parted in Seattle. There are darker memories too that cause this need to block the world out. To block the nightmares.

Rogue reached for the bottle again, then paused, taking a deep drag on her cigarette instead. There were already going to be enough sore heads in the morning, she didn't need to add hers to the mix. She studied him out of the corner of her eye, then sighed. She knew that look. She stubbed out her cigarette on the wall, then moved closer. ""Look, t'aint gonna do either of us any good, ain't gonna do the house any good, us bein' like this. We need to come to some sort of workin' agreement or somethin.""

He raised an eyebrow, head tilting to the side. ""Oui. We do at dat."" He set the glass aside and twisted slightly in the window to look at her better. With most people, it would have been uncomfortable. For him, it was just normal. ""Any ideas? 'Fraid my head ain't 'actly right for t'inkin' right now.""

She held back a snerk and a retort about his normal state of mind. ""Can't say as I do,"" she said. ""Guess we just ... we always do OK as teammates, no matter what else is goin' on."" That's about all she had to offer right now. To work as his teammate. To consider him as such 24 hours a day.

Remy nodded, knowing that it was the best he could hope for unless he was actually able to tell her about the tunnels. ""Teammates. Dat's good enough."" Definitely good enough to keep them from trying to kill each other in the halls. Maybe enough to keep either one of them from spending their nights drinking. Okay, enough to keep him from doing it, maybe.

Rogue picked up the bottle again, clinking it against his glass before she took another shot. ""Teammates.""

Wasn't exactly a lot of use protecting the president today. Pompus asshole that he is. Kitty said that he basically blamed us for what happened. Nevermind that we saved his ass from having a hole blown in it. I wish I could go back to last night and pray that it was Belle who would be causing problems. Better than what happened.

Sabertooth was there. Damn it, I wanted to kill him. But I was back at the entrance, doing my best to protect those fleeing. What I really wanted to do was go over there and beat him down. Logan took care of him, for the most part. Kitty got Hatcher out and away from danger. Ungrateful bastard. The worst thing is...there's no way for this to have gone well for us. Absolutely none. Had we not been there and the new Brotherhood attacked, we would have been blamed for ignoring the possible threat. Had we been there and the threat been a regular human, we'd have gotten hell for taking out said regular human. Only thing that could have saved us was if it was a regular human and we weren't there, and I'm not too sure that would have helped.

Jean's back. She was at the inauguration. Lucky us, I guess. One of the old students was there too. Didn't get to see much of her, even last time I was here.

Should e-mail Ian, tell him to make sure his shields are tight. I'm betting they are, though. The house is buzzing like the bayou in July. Something happened here. Something that's got the kids tense. I don't think the teachers are going to help that right now.

Damn it. I need a drink.

Judging from my e-mail, so does Kitty. Can't blame her. I'll restock supplies and invite Bobby too. And see if we can talk about anything but the fiasco for a while."

Didn't feel like going downstairs and dealing with the other people having trouble sleeping, so I climbed out of my window and onto the roof. It's still cold out here. The backyard doesn't quite look right without the fort now. I suppose it's better than leaving the sad, half-destroyed remains.

The snowbattle was fun, even if I didn't get much in the way of warning. That was on Monday, in the afternoon. Should have worn better gloves. Dislocated the left ring finger. Would have been more worrisome, but it's not like I wear anything on that finger. Anyway, Bobby's team won. Kate was at least gracious about it. Kate's one of the students. La petit roux, the little redhead. She seems a good enough kid. Got to talk to her in the kitchen for a bit. A little...hmm. I guess I never thought I'd see someone who could outperform Bobby on a sugar-high. The girl sure does jump from subject to subject fast, though. She's a good kid. Just needs to learn the meaning of the word 'boundary'.

Rogue's here. Bobby warned me about that when he called (which I've just realized I haven't mentioned in here--he called right after the last journal entry). Still, seeing her...we ran into each other during the snowball war. Well, I ran into her, she fell for me. Well, fell on top of me, at least. <strike>Wish I could say it was more metaphorical than literal.</strike> <i>New Year's resolution: Stop letting the past hold me back.</i> I think I'm going to have to keep reminding myself of that. <strike>It's just that there's still a part of me that loves her.   </strike>

Anyway, Bobby's team won. That means Kate's team has to serve his team for a week. Rogue was on Kate's team. I'm not going to take advantage of that. If things were different, maybe. Just...maybe.

Also feeling guilty because I haven't asked Bobby how HE'S doing. Been trying to get all the news that I'd nearly forgotten that he was about as far off the normal mark as I was before I left. At least he was trying for normal. He never did tell me what was going on. Probably a good thing. Might have run sooner. He doesn't want to get mixed up between me and Rogue. I'll do my best not to put him in that position.

Seen Ian. Not sure what he's doing back at the school. Maybe he's one of the new TAs. I've seen a lot of the students from last year here. Bobby said there's about 2/3rds of them back, TAing. One of them is pretty much an X-Man. Not sure how I feel about that yet. The whole recruiting thing bugs me in ways I can't explain. I chose to join the X-Men. I wasn't trained in Xavier's dream the way so many of the others have been. I like to think I'm here because I believe and not just because I'm trying to atone for things that can't be atoned for. Then again, who knows? I'm probably just lying to myself.

Jane had a vision. She couldn't tell me what it was when I came across her in the kitchen, but I found out later. Apparently it has something to do with Hatcher's inauguration. Summers thinks there may be an assassination attempt. Too bad I don't know the Guilds the way I used to. Would have e-mailed Belle about it, but we don't seem to be on speaking terms right now. And even if we were, she probably wouldn't tell me of they'd been hired. Besides, the Assassins Guild doesn't tend to do too much in the way of political assassinations.

Maybe I should e-mail her, just to check. Girl's probably up right now. Don't know why I didn't mention it to Scott earlier. Probably just the hope that there's really nothing there, that Belle isn't behind it. Maybe I didn't mention it because Kitty and Rogue got to talking about spandex and the thought of...no. Not going there. Always nice to see Kitty, though. Even when she does snark at me (good-naturedly, of course) about the magenta uniform. Okay, okay, Kitty, you're right. It IS pink...

Spent some time in the Danger Room with Summers. Beat up some of the Marauders. No Sabertooth. Probably best that way. I'm apparently forgiven for my part in the office prank. Either he's getting a better sense of humor or he was just in a forgiving mood. My guess would be the latter. Cyclops doesn't HAVE a sense of humor. 

On my third cigarette. Don't normally chain-smoke like this, but I'm nervous, I guess. Shouldn't leave so much time between writing in this thing. Too much happens and I get behind and end up eating up three pages trying to get my thoughts down.

<i>[English]Battle <strike>tomorrow</strike> today (just checked my watch and it's 1 am). I'm going to leave this journal in the drawer, but it'll be unlocked. If something happens...whoever finds this, please tell Rogue that there's a safe deposit box in New Orleans. My father can tell her which bank if she doesn't know already.

Need to go Christmas shopping. Feeling guilty because I do this every year: I expect nobody to give enough of a damn about me to get a present, then end up with a list of people long as my arm to buy for.

Tante Mattie had given him one for his first Christmas at age ten. She had given him one every year since then. Some years he never wrote it in. Other years, he had to buy new ones because he ran out of room.

He threw down the pen and stood up, walking away from the desk. His New Orleans home was on the very outskirts of the city. Mardi Gras was less than a month away. The Guilds would be busy and even he wouldn't be denied a chance to take part in the revelry. People were careless when they got drunk. Anything could happen.

He tried to remember the last time he'd been to a proper Mardi Gras. It had been a while. It would be good to be back and see one, to participate in all that the city had to offer up in the spirit of the carnival.

""And if you come 'cross a couple of Assassins cuttin' some poor man up, what you do den, Remy?"" he muttered to himself, then sighed. He would stop them. Because he had seen too much death to just ignore it when it happened around him.

He put his forehead to the window for a moment, feeling the cool glass against his skin. Then he turned and walked back to the desk. He didn't sit down, though. Instead, he reached across it and picked up a pair of tickets to the BeauSoliel concert in three days. Gifts from Scott Summers aka Fearless Leader. He stared at the tickets for a moment, then sat down and opened the journal to the first page again. He looked it over, picked up the pen and put a line across the page.

<i>Can't keep that one. Damn it. Maybe next year.

Resolution this year: Stop letting the past hold me back. And punch Sinister in the jaw if I ever see him again.</i>

Satisfied, he closed the journal and tucked it away into a locked desk drawer. Nobody would get to it there.

If there was one thing a thief knew about, it was security."

"event","i probably won't update until i'm either in chicago or after i come back. but i just wanted to say bye here =) so far this summer i've been through a lot and hopefully these three weeks will help me clear my mind a little more and help me really focus. i have a busy two days until my flight, i have another cotillion practice tomorrow and i told katie that we would do something on tuesday. i still need to pack. i know i've been putting it off for waaaay long. & i still have to do my english assignment, finish reading the crucible and write that essay on what is an american. i'm not sure what to write for that yet, maybe i can get feedback in chicago. 

ashley -- when i come back, i'll most likely have that banner done. i just have no time now...

"event","i don't know what it is about those doctor shows that just gets me hooked. i fell in love with grey's anatomy and yesterday i was watching ER and i loved it. i'm not usually a big fan of doctor-esque shows. i was actually pretty into everything that was happening. with ER you get this dramatic vibe that plays along with the whole 'excited hospital' concept. and what i love about grey's anatomy, is that the doctors on the show, aren't just doctors. i mean you get a taste of their personal lives, which intervene with what's going on in the hospital. it's all very good.

it seems like my friend procrastination is at it again. i really have to get moving on my american lit project for september. i'm going to be very busy with trips, cotillion practices, and everything else in between. my best friend called the other day and wondered what was up because i haven't been talking to her in a long time. my other friend, is going to move and i have yet to get her a card. i know things are getting a little hectic if can't even find time to talk to my friends. i haven't seen a lot of people since the last day of school and even though that was only like three weeks ago, it seems like forever. 

it's already july. and in nineteen days my vacation starts. in two months i have to go back to school. and around the end of next month cross country starts back up for me. i'm happy that i'm actually doing something this summer but i'm just all mixed up. 

it doesn't help much that my brother is the biggest pain in the ass. when i'm not at home, i feel all relaxed, but my brother keeps arguing with my cousin and it's just so annoying. i'm actually scared to leave him when i go to chicago. i mean i'm usually the only breaking up the stupid idiotic fights.

"event","ah. dance practice wasn't that bad. actually i get the most of it & after going over it like five million times, i think i'm not going to mess up that much. the bad part is, it's a fast song [come on over by christina agularia] & the moves are pretty fast too. there's another practice on saturday and then another one on tuesday. so i survived today... and i guess i was scared for nothing. i just have to pay attention and i'll get through it.

i seriously cannot wait until CHICAGO. =) we have the final plans ready and soon i'll be in the windy city =D 

i'll be one busy girl this summer ...

i have to eat -- actually i had a little something during practice, but i'm still hungary.. & tomorrow i have to get my phyiscal done for cross country. & i forgot about my summer practices for cross country too, which will probably be in the end of august. & the weekend practices for the cotillion... i hope i can still get my varsity letter this season and be able to do everything else."

"event","i have to learn ballroom dancing over the summer. it's for my friend's sweet sixteen & i'm part of her cotillion court. i cannot dance. it's something that i have never been able to do and i don't think i will ever really master dancing. yesterday we had a ""pre-practice"" practice, for those whose first time it is dancing ballroom dancing. luckily, i'm not the only one that's a beginner at this. there's this other girl that's at ths same level as i am and hopefully we can help each other out. 

i got the basics yesterday and i had a really good partner, hopefully he'll be my partner for the actually dance, because we get the steps and we dance pretty good. 

it lasted like four hours and in the beginning i needed so much help on the little things, but i figured, if i can run a mile without being tired, or learn the reinaissance all by myself for history honors, then i ballroom dance. 

i have the actual practice tomorrow, and i'm pretty scared. i mean the people that are also in the cotillion are experienced dancers that know what they're doing. the person teaching us the dances is known for teaching hard steps too, but i'm ready. 

chicago plans are underway with e-mails going back and forth new jersey and chicago. my cousin daphne, who's going with me there, and i already have places that we want to check out and stuff. the down part is, i'll be missing A LOT of practices because of this. 

& i'm playing a fall sport, and apparently that can interfere with practices, which i don't think will, but whatever. cross country season kicks off in a month or so, with the first meet on the second day of school, so there is no time to rush everything. i just hope i can do all of the things that i've been planning. 

i really do want to learn how to dance this, because i thought that it was nice that she picked me to be part of her court, and i get to be all dressed up and it'll be a really good experience for me... i just hope i can survive this..."

"event","i'm not going to have any more money in my bank account. since my parents are paying for my plane tickets to chicago, i have to pay for all of the spending. i really do not want to take any money out of my account since i was saving that, at least not until i get a job, which i am intending of doing right after i turn sixteen in january. i'm not sure if my dad already bought the tickets, but he told me at dinner that i had to use my own money. when he started with ""so you're going to chicago..."" i thought i was getting ""the lecture"".

everytime i go on a trip with friends or whatever, i get this lecture saying how i have to be on my best behavior & how i'm lucky enough to have parents that pay for me, & not to do anything stupid while i'm gone. the last time i got this was in 8th grade, when i was going on the graduation trip. actually he told me that i couldn't go, but then i told him how everyone was going & that it was for graduation, so he agreed and told me the whole ordeal again. 

but this time, he gave me the money lecture, i guess because i'm older & i've heard it a million times. tax in chicago is 8%, which is like shopping in New York, which i never do. i love how new jersey has no tax on clothing & stuff. i guess using my own money is good too, since i'm going to be more carefuln not to get things that i can already get in new jersey for less. what i don't want to happen is my cousins [who i'm staying with] won't pay for everything, like what they tried to do when they went here. they took my brother & i to columbia university [my cousin is an alumni there & it was her reunion weekend] and they paid for half the things i bought.

then they took us to the mall & paid for a $50 game for my brother & they said that i could get anything in hollister. i insisted that i pay for my coffee at starbucks because i felt so bad....

all this talk about my cousins & chicago is making me even more exicited about the trip. i'm leaving on July 20 and coming back August 9. 

so it's a little over two weeks ... i cannot wait =)"

today was like such a waste. all did was eat in all of my classes. it was fun though since i carried like no books. i did however take a test early in the morning and FAILED. i mean i don't even need to know my grade because i know that i just bombed it. i really did study though, like crazy too. but i guess it just did not help me cause i just did so bad. other than that, the day was not that bad. we sang christmas carols and stuff around the halls. we made a lot of noise, but we sounded good. we had parties for the whole day. it was relaxing and stuff. 

i want a lot of christmas. what i want most is an IPOD. but that's like $25O and yeah. that's way too much. anyways what i really want are PENS. no joke. i need pens for school. i sound like a dork.

after alegbra, had gym and i climbed this cargo net even though i was scared as hell. i actually want to try it again, and not be so scared cause really it's not a big deal and it's kind of fun. after that had science. took this really easy quiz, got an A on that. talked to my science teacher ... i laugh too loud in that class. =) anyways that was basically my afternoon. tomorrow we're having a pizza/holiday party in class -- so basically that's a free period. oh and so my afternoon would be like this lunch -- gym -- science party -- tech. such an easy day!! =) i'm happy.

SCH0OL -- it was alright. the morning was C0LD. i mean it was so freezing that i could hardly talk. got a ride and then went to chorus. had practice and missed first session because we have a concert tonight. then just went to spanish and english. i swear my english teacher hates me a lot. i know that i get paranoid but it's so strange how she likes me one day and then the next i swear she's making voo-doo dolls out of me!! well after english i talked to my algebra teacher cause i had a question. talked to her about shopping (which is something that we both have in common ... we're MAJOR shopaholics) and just random stuff that popped into my head. it was fun. after that i want to the computer lab with my friend. after lunch i had tech, had algebra, and then gym. it was funny though cause today i was supposed to go on this field trip to another school but i knew that i was doing something imp. in alegbra so i asked my teacher and she was helping me come up with excuses, well not really excuses cause we really did something important. i was saying how i should just say that i'm failing but that is no not true cause i'm getting the highest average in her class (not to brag or anything... =/ ) anyways she told me not to lie ... and i didn't. kind of. haha. it was one of those you had to be there moments. i had another one in english.

girl in class: yeah he was dancing with me and his hand was on my boob, so i told him to move his hand so he did but he moved his other and so i was like, the other hand

(my teacher looks at my group and starts giving us strange looks -- it's so great haha. it was so funny)

i have to start my homework -- i have a concert to go to at school at 6:30 and i have to hurry `=)"

today - pep rally. wow. it was so boring. talked to my alegbra teacher for a good chunk of it. it was really boring. i guess the only part that was cool was the dance team -- everything else was okay. before all of that though -- my classes were okay. my afternoon was the easiest. it was lunch -- free -- science -- pep rally. `=) got in trouble though for a) wandering in the hallways and b) for bumping into people as i was leaving the pep rally. oh well. today was fun though. i smiled a lot and i have not done that in a while.

tonight -- filipino mass @ the chruch. i finished most of my homework already and i'm looking foward to tomorrow!

tomorrow -- morning shopping with my mommy =) then my relatives from down under are coming tomorrow night and on sunday we're headed to chinatown `=)"

"event","thanks guys for the picture comments. actually - yesterday the reason i was mad was someone said that i looked ugly - which totally pissed me off like whoa. 

anyways -- wow. today was so great. seriously. i want to like cherish this day and keep it forever. =) i guess we can start from the beginning.

morning - chrous. i have to wake up early for this. anyways i saw my math teacher and she told me that i stole like 12 pieces of gum. um no?! lols. i told her no but whatever. it was funny. chrous was boring. but i <3 singing. first session was english 1 honors. had to write an essay and you know what sucks? i found out the right way to write it AFTER i handed it in. blah. i don't like that. homeroom. again. BORING. then i had history honors. dude. i was so talkative in that class. i annoyed everyone in my room and my teacher. i talked about everything that just popped in my class. i talked about shopping, my past stories, EVERYTHING. it was crazy. then i had journalism. BORING class. i regret signing up for that as my elective. i should have taken a free or something instead. but no. i just had to want to be a journalist. lols. just kidding.

lunch & afternoon - went out to get chinese with my best friend, katie. i was so nice and paid for both of us `=). what's funny is that we were the only ones in the chinese place that was not a pot head because most of the people there smoke & stuff. after that we went to get candy `=) went back to school like a half and hour early and i had to give a pack of gum to my alegbra teacher cause remember how she said that i stole gum from her -- i took one piece cause she said that i could -- anyways -- i just got her a new pack of gum cause she made me feel so guilty about things and it was only a dollar anyways. but she wasn't in her room when i went there so i had to wait. talked and walked with katie. went with her to her spanish class and i headed down to gym but before going there i went and dropped off the gum to my teacher. haha. she thought it was bizarre when i gave it to her. gym was boring. just tied this rope for project adventure. not tht fun. at lease i know how to tie a figure eight on a bite now -- and a safety knot `=) yupp. so now i will not fall off. haha. after gym i had tech. i finished all my work for that class really early so i finished my english honors reflection. then i had science -- failed a quiz there. my teacher knows that i try really hard but i just can't get what we're doing. i seriously have to come in for extra help. i just couldn't though becuase i was busy at lunch all throughout this week. i have to get help before the next test in two weeks!

so that was my day. i hope you have fun and exit stage left `=)"

so. today was alright. i just read something that was so stupid. it was someone's blog about how stupid people are for saying how many problem's they're facing & stuff & how they should just get over themselves. well. prior to that person saying that, they were just talking about how many problems they were facing! wow. talk about being an obvious hypocrite. 

tomorrow ; i'm actually looking forward to tomorrow! there's this club party that i'm going to with my friends cause we're all in the same club at school. i can't wait cause there's food! i love it already. and tomorrow is gilmore girls. although it's a replay.

I miss middle school. 

I hate high school.

My friday night was supposed to be fun and cool but it just was so bad. I'm crying so much that my eyes hurt and the worse part is no one cares. No one asks me how i'm feeling and stuff. I just want someone in my life to care. I have like no more friends because I hardly see them and my best friend and I seem to be drifting away. I'm starting to like my teachers but I doubt they like me ... and I just want to smile ... for more than a moment again."

"event","I've been neglecting this once again. Well school is okay. High school is said to be the best four years of your life. I'm not sure about that yet. There's auditions for this school musical that's on Monday. I have cross-country practice that day because there's a meet the following day. But I really want to try out. Maybe I can go on the later time. In chrous last year I was the best singer (not to brag or anything) and now this year it's different. I haven't been able to ""catch"" up to the other really good singers. 

At lunch Lumi, Katie, and I went to the chorus room to have this interview with the teacher since we're new. I found out that I'm an alto. An alto?! I was trained to be a Soprano for two years and now I find out that I was wrong the entire time?! I sing Soprano. I can't sing low notes because I'm not used to it. I complained in my mind when he was explaining how I was better off as an alto. I wanted to cry over one little voice part.. I sound pathetic but I just was so upset. 

Then I have go to suffer through Tech class and I'm just happy that I can finish my work earlier than everyone else. High school is so different than I had pictured it. With the work that's expected of you and everything, it's too much for me to handle. I want to drop my honors classes but I know that I'm hurting myself if I do. I wrote a letter to one of my favorite teachers last year telling them how badly I wanted to get in to the honors class and how I think that I will work harder. But I lied. I just wanted to take an honors class for the challenge. I'm stuck. 

I don't feel as happy as I was when I was in middle school.

I hardly have a smile on my face in class. I guess I miss my old school life too much. 

I sound like a loser right?!"

"event","<P>Yup. Summer is over for me. School starts up tomorrow and then it's back to everything that I dreaded. I'm scared. Scared because it's high school. Scared because I know that I will be paranoid and think that everything and everyone is aganist me. I already miss middle school. The teachers the most because seriously it's always the teachers that make or break the year for me, and my 8th grade teachers rocked my socks =) I had cross country practice today. Oh joy. At lease Peter was there with me the entire time. I wanted to walk around with Katie and stuff today but I was too scared that she was going to say no or something. I am so paranoid with stuff like that. So I'm here. I want to see some friends and talk about this summer and stuff. I'm missing it all already. Tomorrow I am no longer an 8th grader but a freshman. A freshman?! Wow. Yesterday we were running and we saw the new graduating class of Honiss (my old school) and Katie said ""Oh look 8th graders"" and I just turned cause I wanted to see who they were. I forgot that it wasn't anyone that I knew because I'm now a frosh. Scary feelings. </P>
<P>I guess I'm so used to going to one school my entire life and it's just so hard to leave I guess. I just want to visit it one day and just say hi to everyone and see how much I can remember from sitting in that boring classroom and listening to the lectures of life and I can remember thinking ""I cannot wait until next year"" and now I regret it. Why? Well school is already in session for me. Damn the cross country practices. Damn the high school. Whatever. I'm ranting. Freshman friday is like going to be so much fun. Oh joy. The worse part is that EVERYDAY after school I have cross country practices. Crap. Whatever. New beginnings right?!</P>

Now all I got to do is print it out [<STRONG>but since my dad thinks that school is not until forever I doubt I can get ink within the next week</STRONG>]. Anyway this morning, the first thing that hit my mind when I woke up was - Cross-Country practice. I finally got my butt out of bed at like 8:00 because I still had to eat breakfast and I had to walk. Ate some toast with butter and sugar sprinkled on top and I changed and started to walk. I saw Maryann's car on the way and I was so happy because I wanted another freshman girl to come to morning practices. Then just as we were headed to start running guess who shows up<EM><STRONG>?? </STRONG></EM>Lauren<EM><STRONG>!!</STRONG></EM> Lol. So I had two running buddies today =] Well first we ran once around the track, just to loosen up, and then we streched, and then we had to run at lease 2.5 miles. Wow. That was so long and boring. Lauren was waaaay too fast for me and Maryann lol. We [<STRONG>me and Maryann</STRONG>] walked and when we saw a green or white car we would ""run"" because those were the colors of the coach's car. It was so tiring. But we finished - we were the last freshman but whatever - at lease we came and we tried. We ran twice around the track at the end and then we went home. Tonight we have practice again ... at the park. I'm going to try to not to walk at all [<STRONG>unless I'm going to die</STRONG>] and I'm going to strech a lot at the end. Actually my legs don't hurt as much anymore which is good. </P>
<P>I'm reading two new books too [<STRONG>Teen Idol and Pop Princess</STRONG>] ... at lease I'm done with the reports and now I can rest and just wait ... why?

Then we found out that she and Kirsten and Ashley couldn't run because they just handed in their physicals (well Katie did. Kirsten and Ashley have to get them done). But they ran anyways. Lol. First we ran two times around the track (half a mile) and then we streched, and then we ran another half mile, and then we ran another mile, and I think two half miles. I was so hungry because I didn't eat dinner yet, we finished at around 8:15-ish. There was another practice at 9, which I skipped but there is another one at 6:00 at the park. Hopefully Lauren, Katie, Kirsten, and Ashley can all go. Kay is going to Cancun (lucky her). So I'm looking foward to tonight - oh and ... can you believe that I still have not seen the promo for Gilmore Girls? That's crazy man. Lol.

"event","<P>After being on a wild LJ hiatus, I think it's safe to say that I'm finally back. Thanks to those who commented on my last entry. Life is getting better and better each day. School is rapidly approching, and I have yet to complete those reports that were assigned to us. I talked to some people before and I stand by my prediction about how everyone will change during the summer. They already have. Katie's mom had her baby - Nicole Monica =) It would have been so cool if they named it Rachel Nicole because Katie's mom's name is Monica. Anyway we talked for like five minutes on the phone, I cannot wait to see her during cross-country practice tonight. Anyway back to the changing thing - I'm scared. I'm going to be a freshman in high school. I mean I'm happy to have met some other freshman through xanga and I know how they're spending their last days of summer. I think I'm the only one that's not going to change. The only thing that changed is my hair cut lol. Anyway I had such a negative vibe from most of the people in my graduating class. I mean I'm so happy that most of them are not in my class, thus making this such a new beginning for me. New school, new classes, new friends.
You could say that a lot has happened since my last entry here, and a lot has happened. I found out that the people who I considered as ""friends"" is anything but that. I guess it's my jealousy part coming out. Everyone is getting closer to each other, and here I am. Sure I talked to a lot of them online, and then there's the occasional phone call, but it's not the same as being there and having these strange and fun stories to tell. I guess I have a few stories too. The big story has to do with a boy. A boy that likes me, and he's away in California while I'm here on the other side of the country. I liked him too but now things are different. He wanted to talk to me but I was too scared, I didn't know how to hide my feelings or express them. I guess if he comes back I'll be more open.

She doesn't like him yelling at everyone and cursing at how his life sucks because that just makes everyone else feel so bad. I mean he didn't even want to wait for her at the airport when she came home from Florida. He was so pissed off because their fucking flight was delayed that he was just getting fucking pissed at everyone. See. I hate how abusive my dad is. No one will ever know this but now. This is the only time I really spoke up. For now I guess I just have to pray that things will get better. I just have to pray that one day things will change and my family will be better. Please God. I'm counting on you the most. I just want to be able to smile again instead of crying my heart out. I need a friend to be there for me. 

I needed to get out of the house. Things just got so bad for me there. I hated how I would cry for no reason and I hate being stressed and having no where to go and so I left. I'm at the library with my brother. I just wanted to get away from it all so I can just breathe and maybe smile or something. For now I'm just working it out and trying to make life worth living again. I just hope that things will get better for me so I don't have to cry. Just as long as I try to be that ""perfect"" daughter that my parents always wanted. I try really hard though but no one seems to care and I doubt that in the near future anyone will ever care. I just want to go back to the days where I cared about nothing during the summer - back to the days when nothing mattered and just as long as I was doing what I was supposed to nothing bad was going to happen. But I can't just turn back time ... though that would be such a cool thing to do. Okay. I'm done. Just give me a little message telling me that you care."

Afterwards we went to my parent's friend's restaurant &amp; then made plans to go to the ice cream place &amp; got some ice cream. Then we went back to the restaurant &amp; didn't get home until past midnight. The next day I woke up pretty late &amp; then I just rested the rest of the afternoon until my mom said that after we bring my grandma to the airport my dad said that we might go to this outlet mall that was near the airport. Of course I was happy because I didn't go to that outlet mall let. I got ready to bring my grandma to the airport. We drove &amp; got to the airport. We dropped my grandma at the wrong gate so we drove her to the right one. Anyway after the airport we didn't go to the outlet mall afterall &amp; that was pretty bad. But later my mom, brother, &amp; some of my mom's friends went with us to this mall &amp; I got a skirt &amp; shirt. My mom brought me sandals &amp; then we didn't get home after the mall was closed. Sunday I checked my e-mail &amp; my cousin sent me an e-mail to see A Cinderella Story with her on Friday&nbsp;&amp; since I didn't check my mail, I never got to call her back. I replied her, saying that she should ha ve called &amp; that we could make plans to see another movie before she goes on vacation. Then my mom said that I had to get a haircut &amp; I went &amp; got one. It's shorter &amp; I kind of like it which is pretty rare because I usually hate my hair short. Anyway we ate at this Japanese restaurant &amp; after that we went over my brother's Godmother's house. Watched I Love The 9O's, Stuck in the Suburbs, &amp; Full House. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Now I'm at home babysitting my brother for four hours until my parents come back from work. It's pretty boring since my parents told me not to go out, use the mircowave or answer the phone unless I check first.

I know that my parents will always look at me the same, but I don't want them too. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents but what I did last night just made be want to be gone.

There was this period where I would cry for no reason, just because I couldn't handle all that emotional stuff being thrown at me. Now I know that I have to make the best of it & maybe that'll help me in the long run. I miss my friends, I miss how they make me laugh & they let the best out of me. Okay.

<P>Not much to say - this summer has been boring but in two weeks I'm going to PA &amp; hopefully that will change things. Whatever though. My outlook on life is not as bright as it was before it's okay though I guess. I have to start my reports for my honors classes which I have been putting off for a month now. Procrastination is really bad &amp; I hate doing it.</P>

EDiT: My best friend, Katie came over to talk & we walked around & talked a lot. We both wanted to go to the mall but we're only 14 with no car - well we talked about getting summer jobs next summer & we walked to the library & looked @ clothes that we wanted to get online. After that we walked back to my house & she called her mom & then went home. Fun day with my best buddie =)"

"event","<P>Yup. I'm back at this whole Livejournal thing. I kind of missed it &amp; now I'm back =) For those of you who don't know me I'm Jessa (previously JavaJunkieAngel ). I'm 14 &amp; currently living in NJ. </P>
<P>Saturday - Went to my uncle's house because it was his birthday &amp; had a chance to talk with my cousin who in two years will be off in college. There was this guy there who shall be called ""stalker guy"" his real name is Miguel but ""stalker guy"" is better suited for&nbsp;him. Well stalker guy apparently had a crush on me &amp; he lived up to his name &amp; stalked be throughout the party. My cousin &amp; I hid in her room &amp; watched TV &amp; whatnot. But with stalker guy there it was just so weird. Eventually he stopped getting the message that I hated him &amp; that I would hurt him if he got 5O feet near me. To make matters worse my brother was ""friends"" with this guy &amp; told my mom everything from him liking me to me hating him. Okay. If my mom was Lorelai Gilmore then yeah I don't care but she isn't. My mom turns one little thing into the biggest thing in the world by telling everyone in her phonebook what happened. *sigh* Wow. Isn't my family fun?</P>
<P>Sunday - Woke up late &amp; went to IHOP for brunch. Then went home &amp; watched America's Sweethearts for the millionth time. Julia Roberts is my favorite actress now =) Then I went online &amp; just rested that day. Went out to get a haircut but the place was closed &amp; so I think I'm going today. I'm scared though because I hate getting haircuts. But change is good =) Then just ate &amp; went to sleep. Wow. That was the dullest day EVER. </P>"

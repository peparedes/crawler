I had written a lovely, long entry about my trip Honduras and was just about to click ""update journal"" when lighting struck nearby and the power went out for an hour or so. It was a really eloquent entry. Or at least I can say it was.

Hmm... I'll try to sum it up

Honduras was absolutely wonderful. The people were welcoming, the place was beautiful, and I learned an enormous amount, even in that short time, about everything from Miguel's family history to their city's struggle with political corruption to the bogus new president of Honduras to the continuing aftermath of hurricaine Mitch in 98.

I miss it. And not just that surface-ache missing a nice place or that nausea of missing a boyfriend ('cause I feel both of those too). But I really, truly miss Honduras. I connected to it and to the people I met there in a significant way.

I can't wait to go back.

And now, lucky girl that I am, I'm already packing up my backpack for my three-week adventure in Eastern Europe with Chelsea.

Hopefully the power won't go out when I write an update about Europe."

It's not summer vacation. I mean, it is in the sense of no work for a while. But there's no schoolyear on the other side of this vacation. I feel at home here, but implicitly less welcome. My parents love having me here and I think they wish I wanted to stay. And everyone else will be glad to see me too. But it's not the same. College students are expected to pop in and out of their hometowns, staying for a weekend or three months depending on the time of year. But college graduates either live at home or they don't. I feel like a wannabe student.

More because of family and friends and goodbyes and planning and GPAs and awards (or not) and keeping in touch and packing and moving and filling out forms and people you'll never see again.

It's been rough.

But I love my family. I'm so glad my sister and brother-in-law were here. Which is to say, there were good things this weekend even though it sucked overall.

One of the hardest moments of it all came when I was walking through my dorm this afternoon checking to make sure people were moved out by noon. I was checking a suite where four of my best friends lived, and they had all left, so their hall was empty. It's such an unpleasant feeling to be the one who is left when everyone else is gone. Plus, there's so much sadness in emptied dorm rooms. The furniture is haphazardly arranged, everything is dusty, cabinets are open, there's a hairtie or two and a few little forgotten knick knacks. It's eerie. College is strange.

I'm mostly moved into my new apartment. And my mom's still here. We leave Wednesday."

1) Home. 

Pros: I can work at any of a number of fancy restaurants and make good money as well as put in some time at the hospital where I've worked before. I would love to be in NM, and I would be happy to be with my parents.  

Cons: Only one of my good friends will be in NM, and the location will be inconvenient in terms of flying about for med school interviews in the fall.

2) Claremont. 

Pros: I could live with Fay (whom I love) for a reasonable price, work work part time perhaps for dance studio or tutor for Kaplan as well as driving to a Children's Hospital clinic a couple of times a week to volunteer. I would be near Miguel, Josh, Caroline, Sarah Cusser, Molly, and possibly Dave, and I would also be nearer to many places I hope to interview. 

Cons: Claremont for another year. Cost of food and rent.

3) Orange County.  

Pros: Could probably live with a family member for a nominal rent, be a few miles from a dozen or so of my cousins and their kids, and be closer to the Children's Hospital. Also, like Claremont, the location would be relatively convenient in terms of med school visits.  

Cons: My family, although marvelous, is perhaps not the best source of a social life for me, seeing as they're all either married or in middle school. Plus, I'd be coming to Claremont for visits anyway.</lj-cut>

I'm terrible at decision-making. Like really. I always admire those people who look at the possibilities, evaluate the options, and then, magically, these people just CHOOSE. I, on the other hand, look at the possibilities, prevaricate, pontificate, and masticate over them, and then end up with whatever is the default option anyway, or sometimes I manage to hoodwink someone else into making the decision for me.

Rather an unattractive character trait, I must say."

Good: Possibility of working at Children's Hospital of Orange County or one of its clinics thanks to cousin Jena who's a marketing bigwig there. 

Bad: Cousin Jay moved to Dallas for work, which means a) as a New Mexican, I am obligated to despise his Texan guts b) I won't get to see him as often because Dallas is way far away from Socal.  

Good: New wee baby cousins are quite adorable. 

Bad: Aunt and Uncle, who are in late 60s seemed OLD, and they've never really seemed old before. Uncle Sonny has gout. Aunt Diane has wrinkly neck and has already packed for their trip to Paris, on which they aren't leaving for another two weeks. Aging family is one of the scariest things. I never had grandparents (all four died before I was born), so I've never really experienced it. But it's definitely starting with my aunts and uncles, and my parents aren't far behind.

Good: Other young cousins are growing up into really awesome pre-teens and teenagers. They seem so old, too, but in a good way. I love them. Especially my 7th-grader cousin, Carey, who I've been close to all her life. She's gonna be such a smart, kick-ass woman. And tall like me. 

Bad: Even though my family is awesome and caring and smart, my anti-racist, anti-heterosexist goals are foreign to their daily lives. Sometimes makes it hard to relate. I should be thankful, I suppose, that this is not true of my immediate family, only of my extended family. I know there are plenty of students and young adults out there who are at odds with parents and siblings, who receive no support even their closest family in terms of their goals. But it's always hard to see the latent racism and heterosexism in some of the people who share my DNA. Reminds me that I'm not nearly so separated from it as I like to think I am. 

Good: Cousin Bryan (father of new, wee adorable baby cousins) was really interested in hearing about my environmental studies and my opinions on species' extinction and global climate change. </lj-cut>

I'm glad I went. Until a year or so ago, I saw them every month or two, but for some reason, I've let a long time lapse between visits lately. The last time I saw this part of my family was my sister's wedding 6 months ago. If I'm still in Socal next year, I need to make the effort to see them more often again. They're so friggin' important to me."

One of my two best friends in the world had her birthday on Tuesday. I fogot to call her. Shitty best-friend behavior. I no longer send gifts to my home friends, so the least I could do would be to call.

I wonder which Pomona people I'll be calling on birthdays four years from now. Never know, I suppose.

We did so much, I won't even begin to write it out here.

Three aspects I loved the most:

1) People everywhere at every time of night or day, which makes for exciting energy, great people watching, and always something to do. (Unoriginal, I know)

2) The sustainability of it all. Small, locally-owned shops, fabulous public transportation (I am in love with the subway), excellent water treatment (cleanest tapwater in the country), roof gardens, greenspace, the forced realization that there are limited land resources for humans on this planet, contrary to the extended history that suggests the opposite in the Western world, and the ability to maintain contact with people, streets, weather, and air everywhere you go rather than living in the plastic and metal bubble of your car as we all do here in la la land.

3) Finding my history. Seeing as neither California nor New Mexico hold much if any family history for me, seeing the Statue of Liberty imbued me with, not patriotism, but a sense of my past in seeing the place through which four of my great-grandparents and two of my grandparents have come during the last century or so. Also, a second kind of history, a cultural history in the sheer Americana of it all. Having been raised with images, ideas, and standards that emerge from New York City, it was exciting to see those things, icons and otherwise that are embedded in my psyche. Those that struck me most deeply were Radio City Music Hall, Bethesda Fountain, and the generalized bright lights and hubbub of main streets and side streets.

So. I'm going back. I need to see more of the City, the other boroughs, and soak it all up."

In other news, saw Alvin Ailey in LA Sat. Two of the three pieces were fun but a bit lacking in inspiration. The third, however, was a re-staging of an extremely famous Ailey piece called ""Revelations."" I absolutely loved it. It was beautiful and amazing, even from the third-to-last row in the entire ENORMOUS theater (four stories up, in the loge). I learned later that they had the music, African-American spirituals, made more modern and pop-y than the original in 1960, which disappoints me and tempers my experience a bit, but I was nevertheless extremely moved by the whole thing. God, if I could spend my life watching dance, how thrilled I would be.

Last dream: That I got drunk off of drugged punch at a house party and was supposed to meet my dad the next morning, but instead I passed out at the house and woke up in the morning without my sweater or my shoes, and as a result, somehow, I ended up with a parole officer (ps. some people really hate hearing other people's dreams.

Even though Liz made the class almost-bearable last semester, the prof, assignments, and lack of lab are all absolutely superior at Mudd. It's one of my favorite classes ever. Miguel makes fun of me, says, maybe because you fit in better at Mudd. I choose to ignore him when he says that

"event","Leaving New Mexico invariably causes a wrenching, tangled sadness inside me. At 5:45 yesterday morning, I said goodbye to my cat, my dog, my parents, and my house, got in the car and drove away crying. And it's not like it's the first time I've left. Nor was it a particularly eventful or spectacular break. 

On my way out of town, in pitch-black, before-dawn silence, I picked up an acquaintance-y friend from high school, who accompanied me on the drive here because he's working on some computer animation project in Pasadena for a couple of weeks. We had an smooth drive and many hours of easy conversation, which was a pleasant surprise, considering that the longest we'd ever spent alone together before yesterday was probably half an hour. 

It's utterly disconcerting to wake up at home and to drive down Indian Hill at sunset that same day. I'll be happy to see people when they start arriving this weekend. But man, I have such mixed feelings about being here and about starting my last semester.

Perhaps the strangest thing of all is that home may not quite be home next time I go back because my parents, after living in the same house for 29 years, are considering moving a little ways out of town, into this beautiful, very small house in the mountains with unbelievable views and direct access to hiking trails and wood-burning stoves. It's an awesome place, definitely the kind of home in which I see myself living as an adult, but it's extremely strange to think of my family being in any other house.

Fuck it. I don't want to grow up."

Santa Fe's crazy like that. Plus, got invited to sit with a Persian optomitrist and a Moroccan vagabond who are recent transplants to Santa Fe. Had some pretty amazing conversations. When one of my high school friends walked by the table, he began speaking Arabic with the Moroccan. Had no idea he spoke Arabic. Drank Bailey's all the while. Mmm."

Coming home means hanging out at friends' houses with all my old classmates (who have all stayed unbelievably close to one another, which makes it even weirder, since I haven't stayed close to them) and feeling, utterly bizarrly, like it could be any given high school hang out evening.

We went by a convalescence home at lunchtime to visit an old family friend who's in her 90's and has just in the last few months lost a lot of her health. We totally weren't prepared for what we found, though. She's mostly deaf and didn't recognize us, nor did she ever really figure out that we were there to see <i>her</i>. She kept asking (sort of unintelligibly) whether she should go get so-and-so, as if we were there to visit someone else and she needed to go find them. That was really hard for all of us. We left after a few minutes because there was nowhere to sit (she was in her wheelchair simply stationed in the hallway), and we had no way to engage her. I'm glad we went. I'm sure she appreciated a smiling face on Christmas regardless, but man, aging is scary. Plus, it made me just sort of angry that her family wasn't there with her on Christmas. They live out of state. But, since I don't know all the circumstances, I relaly can't judge.

Nonetheless, there is a lot to be thankful for, and I've had a good day with my parents--good food, a few good gifts, and beautiful weather."

Miguel was here. Was fabulous. Three of my four best friends in the world got to meet him. I wonder if it was weird for them seeing me with someone else. Had a grand time showing him around Santa Fe, Taos, etc, etc. I only wish he could've stayed longer. He flew back to Honduras on a redeye this morning and arrived safely, but without his enormous duffle bag that contained ALL his clothes and Christmas gifts. The airline, TACA, said he'll get it in 6-12 days. Rotten.

Just went for a hike with my mom out along the railroad that leads from Santa Fe to the tiny town of Lamy. It's a beautiful, clear, relatively warm day, and it was lovely to walk a long way in view of all the mountains. The way back was a trek against the winds, which have been quite blustery these days. Glad to be in my warm house.

Aside from depression, eating disorders, and some other smaller weirdnesses, it's good to see my friends and my parents.

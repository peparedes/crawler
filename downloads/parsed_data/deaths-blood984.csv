Last summer when <a href=""http://www.kroger.com"">Krogers</a> Had a sail on Flank Steak. So my mom stocked the freezer with them. She is letting me have a few fro friday night. Me and the night possy are hitting the campground under cover of the night, and with our Hibatchi we'll just be taking the chill of the meat and eating them just like we like them. Bloody! I love when the blood drips down my face like I am feeding on some unsuspecting victum of the night! that's wow I like me red meat. the redder, the deader, the better!"

"event","Greetings children of the day world. I have decided to journal my walk through the waking hours of this light dimensions. I await the night, and it's eternal bliss and misery. Until then, I will assimilate with the light humans and make those connections that the humans crave. I mean no harm, and accept of most people. If you want to friend me, add me to your firends list and I will add you unto mine. I can be talked to like most mortals, do not fear me."

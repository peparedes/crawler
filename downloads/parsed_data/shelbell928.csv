"event","Hmmm.....wow soo much has changed since I last updated. I am in California and I love it and I have an amazing job that I also love. I work with autistic children as a therapist/teacher. It is really hard work but more rewarding than I can even say. I have a great apartment with irene and June is officially the last month I will have to pay rent in MI. Thank the sweet lord! 
It is nice to have someone here with me because moving this far away can be a very scary thing. We are creating things for ourselves here and slowly but surely finding our own way! I love it and I love her. I miss all of my friends though and can't wait for everyone to come visit! 
Okay well I have to run and go grovery shopping! 

Peace and Lots of love!

"event","Well it has been a very eventful couple of days. So let's start at the beginning of the weekend. 

Friday: Club Triangle= Drag Queen show. Shelley and I met some people at work up there and had a grand old time of it. There were three performers and they were all hilarious. The costumes were amazing. 

Saturday: Bright and early in the Pooter Pool (I will explain) My friend Dana had a grand idea to buy a kid sized pool and fill it up with freezing cold water and call it the pooter pool. (she is hilarious) SO...here I am freezing my balls off in a little kid pool with three other girls getting totally trashed...you have to drink to be able to sit in the cold water. Needless to say I got very burned because I was out there all day. Then that night Shelley was having a bon-fire at her apartment, well actually around the corner from her apartment. So I head on over and proceed to be there through four different waves of people. Till 3:30 in the morning we were out there and I had to work at 7:00 this morning as did Shelley. So we walk back to her apartment and I stay there because I am far too tired to drive. 

Sunday: Wake up to shelley's alarm at 6:00, get up drive home brush my teeth change clothes and go work for 6 hours. Then After work I had to go to a gallery opening so I got all dressed up and went and talked a lady for a long time about what Drama Therapy is. After that I called Shelley and we headed out to Ferndale for the Metro Area Pride Festival. It was tons of fun and I got Jason some really fantastic things...Like a bag that says Big Gay Bag, and a postcard that says God Adores You (GAY) then drove back home and sat around at Shell's for awhile and now am finally home and getting ready for bed because yes do not be fooled I have to be at work at 7:00 am tomorrow also. 

Soooo...have a great night all Peace out."

Man it sucks that right when I am trying to get stuff together to move I make some totally amazing friends. It makes me sad because I really want to move but I am getting sad now that I am leaving all these friends behind. 

I went to see Madagascar with Mike Lane tonight and it was wonderful and then I went I went to the club with work friends and the night was tons of fun. Man for the first time in a long time I am content and I really enjoy doing things around Flint.

"event","I am having one of those long long days that I feel like I am floating through. I started early this morning at work 6:30am-4:30pm to be exact long nine hour day. Then followed that up with a lot of sitting in front of the computer doing nothing. I then went back up to work to talk to a manager and ran into a person that makes my heart skip a beat and they hardly even noticed me. Which normally doesn't bother me but lately has been driving me crazy. I can normally shake things off and get over things but not this time. 

Well no matter I had a lovely dinner last night with some very fun girls from work, and then another lovely lunch with my friend Pat. Yes I am spending way too much money but I really enjoy these little social outings. Another positive note is Rob is coming home soon so that should liven things up around here. 

Have a great day everyone be safe and be happy."

Love you madly-Cake 

I don't want to wonder
If this is a blunder
I don't want to worry whether
We're gonna stay together
'Till we die

I don't want to jump in
Unless this music's thumping

I want to love you madly
I want to love you now

I don't want to fake it
I just want to make it

I don't want to think about it
I don't want to talk about it
When I kiss your lips
I want to sink down to the bottom
Of the sea

I want to love you madly
I want to love you now

I don't want to hold back
I don't want to slip down
I don't want to think back to the one thing that I know I
Should have done

I want to love you madly
I want to love you now

I don't want to doubt you
Know everything about you
I don't want to sit across the table from you
Wishing I could run

I want to love you madly
I want to love you now"

The festival was a culmination of all the work that I had done this year with my classes. It was nice to see all my kids and adults again. I was set up in a big empty racket ball court to do creative drama. It got so loud in there because we were pretending to be animals so there was lots of roaring and jumping around like crazy people. I have another festival on thursday but this time it is for the little little kids 3yrs-8yrs. :o) Days like today really make you look at life in a different light, it is really hard to be sad or to wallow in your problems with kids and adults that have everything from autism to downs syndrome and they are just so happy with life and the little things. Knowing that you helped in any way to make their days better. Oh man that is quite a feeling."

Friends you no longer talk to even though you promised profusely that you would keep in touch. People you used to see every day turn into nothing more than faint memories. It is sad how many people come in and out of our lives. That is what makes the people that we call friends so important. Making friends though is such an exhausting process, and it is nice to have those people who know more about you than anyone else. Who you have been through the worst/best times in your life with. 

Living back home and seeing the places where I used to hang out with my friends makes me feel sad, because everyone that I used to know lives so far away now. It is times like these that I wish I were in a relationship or at least with someone starting a relationship. Because then you have someone when you are lonely. In fact I just talked to my friend Katey whom I have not spoken to since her wedding last year (in which I was a brides-maid) and her and her husband Jason are living in Wisconsin. They hate it because they do not anyone but Katey was comforted by the fact that  had each other. Yeah but what about all of us without others? Then again I have the freedom that Katey does not have, I can go or do anything that I want without having to consult anyone. But at the end of the night when you are all alone it would be nice to have someone to hold on to and to know that they care. ahh well you can't have your cake and eat it to am I right? Still a little cake would be nice every once in a while."

I shouldn't be living in Flint at my parents, I shouldn't be working at a retail store, I should be actively looking for someone to spend my life with, and then I noticed that all those thoughts had a very dangerous word in them: Should. Who laid down all these rules that makes me feel so awful everyday? And who is this mysterious person that we are all modeling our lives after. This made me really mad because I feel like a lot of people I know are trying to live up to things that they think they should be doing. I feel like running around and telling them all the wonderful things that they are doing right, and to remind them that there is no perfect way to live their lives. Although I still want to change the things that are lacking in my life I am not altogether unhappy with what I have been doing, I have made some fantastic friends at Old Navy and I have gotten a chance to work with some amazing kids and adults. I still want to do some things like moving to Chicago, getting more work in theater and creative drama, and being happy with myself all alone but the difference is I don't feel like I have to and that is a nice feeling. There is no perfect Shelly model out there that I should be living up to and that is fantastic because I like to blaze my own paths."

I just worked out for awhile so now it is time to clean clean clean. My room has so much stuff in it that it is hard to not look back on all the fun times I have had in my life. Especially because I never throw anything away. So often I forget about all the fun times and dwell on the crappy instead. But times like this are nice to sit back and think about all the great friends I have had throughout the years. Some I don't talk to as much as I should...sorry guys. It also makes me that much more excited to move to Chicago with my brother because really I think I lucked out in the sibling department, he is a great kid and I am really excited to share an apartment with him. 

On a more sentimental note my family never seems to be far from death someone is always sick and this time it is my uncle who has a brain tumor. My mother is going  to Ohio tomorrow to be with her sister while they make all the plans. This man was a doctor too a radiologist he saw cancer every day dealt with life and death as a profession and now when he is so close to his own he is a mess. He refuses to let anyone help him and my poor aunt is really struggling to deal with everything. This really put a lot of stuff into perspective for me. Anything that goes wrong in my life can't ever compare to that. I can't even begin to imagine anything like that happening and since I have not been around during the duration of the sickness I feel a bit separated from it. Man I have got it good. I am kinda of embarrassed sometimes when I complain or fixate on something extremely childish and ultimately not important. Thank you for being there for me everyone that cares and I am going to try to clean up my life a bit as well as my room."

We just got done with a lovely meal of chicken, pasta, and artichoke hearts...one of my favorite foods. Birthday's always make me very reflective. I was looking at cards today to try to capture my feelings for my father in writing (always a hard thing to do) and I got to thinking about how often I don't tell people what I truly feel about them...maybe I can't find the words, or I am afraid to say them out loud, or maybe I just don't know. I had two cards in my hand...one that I knew would make him tear up and one that was sentimental without over doing it...and I chose the latter of the two. I guess the other one was more of my true feelings but it was hard to be so open even with my own dad so I took the easy way out. Man I can't tell you how many times I take the easy way out, shutting myself off from the world, in fact my mom has begun to refer to me as a hermit...I do think that I am a bit deserving of this title...However it does not take me much to get up and go out just an invitation. So I guess I am just trying to open myself up for new experiences. anywho...HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD I LOVE YOU!!!"

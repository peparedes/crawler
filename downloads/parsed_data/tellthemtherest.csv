"event","Well its been an interesting one. Full of up and downs, narcolepsy and insomnia, alcoholism and sobrriety. It's been a new route. A route with just as much bearing as any other.

The good news is I'm still feeling, the bad news; its not how I imagined it.

Maybe tomorrow will determine everything. Or, then again, maybe it will continue this repetitive cycle of mistakes. We'll see."

"event","Every broken heart must mend. But what about every empty one? Must they go on living? 
I don't think they deserve to, but selfishness is not a characteristic I chose to portray.

I'm trying to figure out what we've been handed and how its meant to be dealt with.

You told me you forgive me but it didn't make me feel any better. I wish I could excuse myself but it's like the guilt is inbuilt. It can't escape, I won't let it. I must pay for my convictions, face them like the decent human being I once was.

Since you've stopped kicking me I continue on my own."

I'm like a vampire but my blood is companionship.

My kryptonite is breaking hearts and letting mine suffice.

Well this time I lost out. I guess its karma."

"event","this is written in anger and haste and will probably be regreted but right now all i need is somewhere to vent. 

why is it the people i love always turn against me when i need them most.

fucking bastard. let me weigh this one up. he'd rather spend new year with the guy who cheated on him, constantly manipulates him, takes him for granted, won't allow him to get over him, lies, lies and oh, wait did I mention lie? and on top of that tries to turn his own friends against him. hmm. so that on scale one. scale two: loyalty, friendship and people who <B>genuinely</B> care, that list could go on but I think those three weigh out the others. fucking naive little prick.

i've not been this angry in a long time and thats even after my family ruining my fucking 18th birthday.

god. i do chose them.

i realise i'm feeling sorry for myself here but i've gave up caring. i need people and people aren't here."

"event","<I>...It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependant upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws taken in the largest sense, being growth with reproduction; inheritance which is implied by reproduction: variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse: a ratio of increase so high as to lead to a struggle for life, and as consequence to natural selection, entailing divergence of character and the extinction of less-improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is granduer in this view by the creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.</I>

That I have the answers for everything 
You were so disappointed 
To see me unravel so easily 
It's only change 
It's only everything I know 
It's only change, and I'm only changing 

You want something that's constant

things that seem still are still changing </center></I>

If only everything was simple - things would be boring, I'm happy with the way they are, I'm happy with where I'm going, even if I don't know where it is.

I refuse to look back. I have no more reason to be excused than the next person and I've finally realised it.

Go me.

"event","Browsing the internet can prove to be quite interesting sometimes, I found this on a random journal:

""What if we are simultaeneously living among other beings which we cannot see, and they cannot see us? Not ghosts, though. Just other humans."" 

Its such a strange concept but I really like the idea. It would explain so many situations. Anyway I don't have anything to write, I just thought I'd share it.

"event","so, i'm sitting here not really listening to the radio and i didnt notice, but a live session from a club came on.  its a pretty good house set and ive been chair dancing to it for a while.
it brings back so many memories.  i havent listened to techno in so long, and i used to all the time.
replays of raves are runnning through my head.  memories of rusty, and the road trip.  watching sweat rain pour from the ceiling of the chicago armory.  i miss that time in my life.  i dont think i would go back to that lifestyle, but its upsetting to realize its over. 
such a crazy time.  i think i seriously believed i was invincible, no other excuse.
i dont think i really realized that it had passed until it was long gone.
*sigh*
this new chapter in my tale seems harder, more consequences.  all of a sudden life is starting to seem short.
i know its so incredibly young, but im really not looking forward to turning 25.  seems like the end of something to me.
i'm aware of my mortality, and im not so sure i like that.
even those anti-drug commercials are starting to be scary.  who'd have thought?"

"event","so today will be fun.  i have to go to my aunt's house to help her split up my uncle's ashes.  not exactly a cheery way to spend an evening, but she needs help, and i dont want her to do it alone.  besides, she's buying the beer.  this is a task we will need to be most drunk for.

things have been kinda crazy.  my best friend has really hurt me, and i'm not sure if i can trust her anymore, which sucks.  i want to believe her, but i am a doubtful person, and don't really have a great amount of faith in her honesty.  hopefully i am just paranoid, because the alternative is too hard to think about.

i spent the weekend with my parents and as scary as it it is, i think me and my mom are actually starting to become friends.  i knew this could happen, but now i dont know what to do.  there are things i can't possibly tell her, but then again, maybe i could.  it's a most bizarre transformation.  she was saying how sex wasn't all it was cracked up to be, and (damn beer) before i knew i was saying it, i responded with ""well, then maybe dad needs some lessons"".  i think i turned as red as my swimsuit.  i knew those warnings on hot tubs that said do not drink alcohol while using were actually true.

oh well, we shall have to wait and see."

"event","Growing up in my family was a magical time for me.  I never realized how lucky i was until i was an adult.  
You see, My maternal Grandparents have two cottages on a lake in Northern Michigan.  They also had five daughters.  The cottages have been around since my mom was young and were always the summer vacation destination.  My grandfather was a high school science teacher, so vacation was an ordeal.  
These cottages are your typical log homes.  Open ceilings, fireplaces, well water, septic tanks, the whole nine.  My aunts had a blast growing up there.  Four out of the Five met their Husbands upnorth and when they had kids of their own, the traditions continued.
I can vividly remember running through the forest with my thirteen cousins.  Splashing in the cool water of the lake, pretending we were mermaids and dolphins.  Hanging upside down from the rafters, hoping my grandfather didn't catch us up there.  Bonfires on the beach.  Playing Euchre by a fire on rainy days.  I was lucky, not many kids had such a place to go.
Not many kids had a family like mine either.  Holidays were always a big event.  Christmas eve with the whole gang.  Dancing and telling stories, reciting The Night Before Christmas around the tree before opening presents.  I was truly blessed.
With such a tight knit group came inseperable bonds.  My cousins and I will always be close.
The first of us got married this weekend.  My cousin, Medora.  It was upnorth...at my Aunt and Uncle's house on the lake.  It was so amazing.  The whole gang was there.  She was absolutely radiant.  The day was overcast, but it was nice.  Just as they said I do, the clouds broke for just a moment, the only time all day, and a ray seemed to shine directly on her and her husband Chris.  The whole group saw it, and i hope it shows up in the videos.
The reception afterward was one of the best times of my life.  The DJ played until after 3am, we had to bribe him to stay, he was supposed to stop at 1.  I danced almost all night.  We ran out of booze three times and had to run into town for more.  There were tears of happiness and hugs all around.
Near the end of the night we got the DJ to play We are Family and the whole group of us were out on the dance floor.  It was magical.
The third to last song of the night was the most special to me though.  I am embarassed to say that it was Def Leopard's Pour Some Sugar on Me.  Dori and I used to have a choreographed dance to the song that we performed all the time, running around barefoot on the lawns.  Medora and I danced together to the tune, holding hands an reminiscing about the good ol' days.  I couldn't help but cry.  It seems like only yesterday and here we were, bare feet covered in blisters, all grown up, her married.
Dori and her Husband have three little boys between them and the next day I took them down to the beach with my brother and we taught them how to skip stones.  Watching the three boys and my other baby cousin run on the edge of the lake looking for flat stones was so much fun.  I only hope they have as much fun growing up together as Medora, I and the rest of us cousins did."

"event","So i live with my bestest friend, elissa and her fiancee, steve and their two kids.  it's a good setup, saves on the phone bills, seeing as me and lis are so tight that we have been known to co-exist on the phone for hours at a time throughout any given day when i was still out west.  being that there are two little ones in the house we usually don't get to chill out and relax until the wee hours of the night when they are sleeping.  this usually involves a couple brews and a game that is both bizarre and relatively quiet, called Pass the Pigs.
Pass the Pigs is kinda like dice, only the dice are little rubber piglets and depending on the way they land when you drop them you accumulate points.  the object is to accumulate 100 pts to win the round.  you roll until you are too afraid to go on or you get a pig out (a certain pattern the pigs land in).  you can also end a turn with sloppy pigs (dropping the pigs from your hand unintentionally) or touching pigs.  To make our game of Pigs more interesting we sometimes play for coins.
Pigs get very intense.  People have been known to whip out dental floss in order to tell if two pigs are in fact touching or just very close.  there are penalties for angry pigs (throwing the pigs across the room) and anxious pigs (picking the pigs up out of turn).  it is extremely amusing to see three grown adults getting heated over a couple of miniature barn yard animals.  it is even more amusing to be one of the three.  people who come over and catch us in a game of pigs must think we are insane!
our nocturnal games have got me thinking, is this how my own parents were when i was young?  was there a whole side of their lives that i never knew existed?  were they out gathered around the kitchen table laughing hysterically while i was tucked warm in my bed?  it only makes sense that they were, and gives me more reasons to love them for everything they've done for me.
the whole experience of coming home from arizona, broken and scared of the world after the shenangigans my ex boyfriend caused me has made me examine my life...and the lives of those most dear to me.  i only hope that twenty years from now i remember these precious evenings spent tossing pigs with friends and laugh as hard as i do now when we are throwing them."

"event","so I just received a disturbing phone call from one of the string of crazy ex boyfriends i have enjoyed over the years.  this particular one is certifiable.  i have been relatively safe from his antics for the past four years, seeing as he has been living in Israel, after reclaiming his Jewish heritage and deciding the good ol' U. s. of A. wasn't for him.  apparently it is safer over there than here.  the number of people who die in terrorist attacks being signifigantly lower than those who die in car accidents on american soil.  he had numbers to support this claim, but i am not very statistically minded and have forgotten them already.

great for israel.  

i am a little disturbed by him though.  you see, he has returned to the united states to ""make his fortune"".  i guess it is harder to make a fortune in israel and so he is living here for a year, i guess he is going to make $100,000 and be able to pay off his debt and return to the mother land, as he calls it.  he claims that ""in america you make a living and in israel you live"".

i don't know, i'm a little offended at the idea of coming here, taking our money and then going over there to spend it.  call me old fashioned...

this guy seriously put me through hell throughout our relationship.  we met a show he was at when i was eighteen.  he was all on this whole music industry kick and was running a production company and managing local talent.  he had long blonde braids and an enthusiasm that was intoxicating.  i was all gung-ho on local music so we ended up working together.  i was managing bands before i knew it.  anyway...we started dating and everything was all happy and fun for a while.

on our 1st month anniversary i had just started a new job and after work i called him to see if he wanted to go out.  his brother informed me that he was on his way to the hospital via ambulance.  apparently he had taken a whole bottle of his anti-depressants that i was unaware he had.  i raced to the emergency room and spent a horrible night watching my blonde haired blue eyed boyfriend vomit charcoal.  never a fun way to spend your anniversary.

he was released after a couple weeks and i ended up moving in with him and his mom for all intents and purposes to help him recover.  i guess he was seriously bi-polar and had not been being treated for it.  mood swings, the whole nine.  it was hell, but i loved him.  i never knew what he was going to do, what he was going to freak out about.  life was hell.  plus i was working 45 minutes away and it was winter in michigan.  i was not having fun.

we dated for a while, through relapses, holidays...me and his mother became very close.  he recovered, and things got better.  he was all lovey and things were good.  one day i called him all excited because i had gotten to see my best friend who was in town from chicago.  he asked if i had read my email.  i had not.  he told me to go read it and then call him back.  he even said i love you.  i checked my email expecting some silly forward and got dumped instead.

a few months later i got a weird message from him.  he was back in the hospital.  i guess he had another meltdown.  i drove out to see him, he begged.  i got there and found him and his mother in the community room.  it was awkward and sad to see him back in the hospital.  he apologized for everything and wanted us to get back together.  

i was distracted by the woman in the corner yelling at a caffiene free diet coke can.  Apparently the diet coke was claiming to be jesus christ and she wanted it to know that it wasn't fooling her.  she was all excited and it was fairly amusing, so i was only half listening to him.  it is fun to watch a lunatic have a conversation with an aluminum can, i couldn't resist.  i almost wished i was nuts too, so i could hear the can talk, i was curious as to what it was saying that had the woman so upset.  she was really heated!

I guess i should tell you the pre-requisite for this stay in the nuthouse.  

Apparently my ex was acting strange and his sister noticed...she was also the one who found him when he attempted suicide, so she didnt mess around when he was acting odd.  she coaxed him into the car and took him to the doctor.  he wouldnt get out once they got there, and she went inside to get the good doctor.  He had locked himself in the passenger seat and had turned the radio all the way up.  while she was inside he let himself out of the car and was dancing in the parking lot.  he had been in ballet as a child and had recently started up again, so he was leaping and twirling with the best of him.  the office was on a four lane highway and he piroetted right out into traffic.  the police were called and mr. twinkletoes was taken off to the loony bin in a pair of shiny bracelets.

anyway, in the midst of the rantings to a can, he proposed to me.  right there in the mad house, down on one knee and everything.  i couldnt help myself...i actually exclaimed Are you insane?  looking around i answered my own question.  i left shortly there after, politely declining his offer of marriage.

shortly upon release he uncovered the fact that his father was half jewish and decided to visit the holy land.  he fell in love with israel and has been there ever since.  i have kept in touch with his mom and therefore have known where he is.  SAFELY BEING A LOON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD!  which i have no problem with.  unfortunately he is back, within fifty miles of me.  i'm a little worried.  i dont really like being close enough to crazy that they could affect my actual life.  hopefully he will make his fortune quickly and head back over the ocean, and in the meantime not make any surprise visits to my door."

"event","So this morning I am ripped from my nice warm bed by my very ambitious roomate, steve.  It seems steve has a bug up his ass, and the bug is very hungry.  Steve is all gung-ho about going out to lunch, and the rest of the house is going along.  The rest of the house, being myself and my best friend...being that the two midgets we live with are at daycare.  Given a five minute notice on our lunch plans i stumble upstairs and man the coffee pot.
You see, steve does not drink coffee and therefore does not quite get the rules of etiquette that are necessary when ripping avid supporters of juan valdez from their beds.  i am usually okay when i am woken up, my best friend not so much...so coffee needed to be made.  
alright, so coffee is brewing and life is okay.  my best friend is still sleeping.  i pad into the bathroom and while doing the whole morning thing hear yelling and screaming from through the wall.  leaving the bathroom i notice that she is still in bed, but the covers are no more and her position as well as facial expression have changed substantially.  i rapidly obtain my coffee, ensuring a direct route from bedroom to Mr. Coffee.  
Unfortunately I was mistaken in her path of destruction.  within moments of my first sip of columbia's second finest she comes barreling down the hall all nine claws extended (she had ten last night but picked one of them off, i guess you can get fungus.)  Luckily i am not her target so i continue to enjoy my coffay.
steve is not so fortunate.  it seems he very stupidly woke her by blowing the oh so unpleasant aroma of a liquid called New Skin (it smells like industrial strength nail polish remover) in her face.
After many threats of bodily harm and suffocation she must have smelled the coffee...good me!  After about a half a cup she is much more pleasant and tells the dumb one that she is no longer mad at him.  Keep in mind two minutes earlier she threaten to shove something so far down his throat that he would not wake up ever!  I wonder about a man who tries to wake up such a beast without the armor of caffiene.  But then again, i wonder about a lot of things men do."

"event","So, I recently, and very unexpectedly, returned to my home state of Michigan after over four years of ""being an asshole out in the world"".  Along with relocation comes the oh so enjoyable job search.  Moving would be so much more enjoyable if you didn't have to worry about finding a new job.
I am a bartender and server (politically correct term for waitress).  I am very good at what I do.  My co-workers in the past have claimed that I could sell a bottle of water to a drowning man.  I don't disagree with them.  Unfortunately, I have come to Michigan in the absolutely slowest part of the year as far as the hospitality industry goes.  
I have filled out so many applications, played nice with so many managers, hostesses, bar owners...etc. that I am ready to walk into the next lobby with an automatic weapon and hold it to someone's head until they put me on a f**king floorplan.  I have written my personal information so many times that my social security number has taken to chasing me through dark alleyways in my dreams.  Not a pleasant way to splend your slumber, let me assure you.
In my desperation for a paycheck I posted my resume on one of those job finder sites.  Within 24 hours I was contacted by a very nice lady who was rounding up candidates for a company I will refer to as Fricken Loans.  We chatted it up for a while.  She  said that it seemed like it would be a good fit for me.  It was out of my usual field of expertise, but still in the land of sales...so what the hell.  I went and had an initial interview with her and got all pysched for the position.  She seemed confident in me, and well, i have a bit of an ego problem so i was confident in myself as well.
The actual interview at Fricken was the following day (tuesday) and I rolled out of bed into the shower and was on my way.  The first part consisted of myself, seven robots and the recruiting lady.  We talked, asked questions and listened to her babble about how great the company was.  By the second babbler I was just about ready to scream.  Luckily they ended the torment.  After that we were sent off on private interviews.
I interview very well.  I don't get all nervous and close mouthed.  Me and Mr. Fricken  were laughing, having a great old time.  He exhausted his five pages of canned questions and we continued talking for at least fifteen minutes.  He excused himself to go and retrieve another Fricken rep. to come and talk to me.  As they returned to the interrogation room they paused outside the door.  The Fricken people don't strike me as being very intelligent, because they chose to talk about me right outside the door.  I could hear every word.  Mr. Fricken told the new Fricken rep.  to ""just go in and talk to her for a few minutes, I love her.  I want her on the team.""
So here I am, all pysched.  It's in the bag right?
I leave the place feeling like Queen of The World.  I mean this job sounded great, and it sure sounded like I had it.  I'm so happy I'm car dancing the entire way home.  Sitting in rush hour traffic on I-94 just jamming out to the Black Eyed Peas, taunting disgruntled drivers with my joy in the midst of bumper to bumper gridlock.
Mind you, I suffer from a mild case of road rage...I once got so angry at a jerk who cut me off that I went to lay on my horn, and upon realizing it did not work, put my fist through the windshield of my 68 VW beetle.  I didn't get hurt, but had to drive the rest of the way to work with a gaping hole in the middle of my view, while on the phone with my mechanic ordering a new chunk of glass...$180...glad it was a beetle.
Anyway, I come home to find a call from the lady who pulled up my resume congratulating me on the job.  Seems Fricken had called her already.  
Day two and I still haven't gotten a call from Fricken, so I called them.  Mr. Fricken seemed all happy to hear from me, but asked for a little more time.  Said they'd get back to me in the morning.
Morning for me, ends around 10:30, so I called them at 10:31.  Mr. Fricken seemed confused to hear from me.  Surprised that no one had contacted me yet.  Shirking the responsibility of telling me himself, he gave me the recruiter lady's extension and told me to follow up with her.  I left her a very nice voice mail, requesting a call back regarding the position.  30 minutes pass and I get a call from the Staffing agency lady.  She tells me that, unfortunately Fricken has decided to go a different direction.  The bastards never even bothered to call me themselves.  I find this cowardly and unprofessional!
If someone makes the time to come and spend three hours talking to you, then I think that 3 minutes to give a phone call is not too much to ask for!  I know I would have been very good at the job, they are idiots for not hiring me, and to my absolute horror, short of spray painting it on their big stupid office, they will never know.
So i'm back to browsing the classifieds, and none to happy with it. I think I'll look through the ads too, see if anyone has a good deal on spray paint."

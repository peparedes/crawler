<center>Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven?


I must be strong
And carry on,
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven.


Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven?


I'll find my way
Through night and day,
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven.


Time can bring you down,
Time can bend your knees.
Time can break your heart,
Have you begging please, begging please.


Beyond the door,
There's peace I'm sure,
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven.


Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same

You know with each day that passes by 
I pray to God I'll never forget who you are
You mean everything to me
I love you

I pray..ooohhooo
ohh I pray yeaa
mmm

You were in my dreams before I even knew
there was a you and me
Now I can't wait to see your smile
When I wake up each day it makes it worthwhile
With the kind of love you plant inside
especially with a heart so empty as mine
all the soft tenderness is the one thing I don't want to miss

(Chorus)
I pray when its time for me to say goodbye
I'll never forget looking in your eyes
I pray that I'll feel your touch 
and that God doesn't forget our love
I pray when I close my eyes 
I can still see visions of you on my mind
I pray that I'll see you in another life
I pray that your still by my side
Oohh I pray...

Everything that you gave to me
only comes in a fantasy
It seems like life goes so fast
but in this time I wanna make it last (I pray)
I hate that we live to die
but only God knows why (I pray)
We all have a purpose
and to see you again it'll be worth it

(Repeat Chorus)

I wish that I can stop time
I wish that I could rewind
to the very beginning of every second of my life
To ask God on my hands and knees
to never let me forget all my special memories
see I'm only promised today 
and if it's my time to go 
I don't want the love of my life to ever fade away
(Oooohhhooohoo)
So one last time 
let me open my eyes
to see what my life used to be like
Oh God...

(Repeat Chorus)"

<font color=ff6600>Hoobstank-The reason



I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
Thats why i need you to hear

I've found a resaon for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is You [x4]

I'm not a perfect person

To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I've found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you"

Dont Cheat! 


Question 1: If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 7 kids already, three who were deaf, two who were blind, one mentally retarded, and she had syphilis, would you recommend that she have an abortion? 


Read the next question before looking at the answer for this one. 


Question 2: It is time to elect a new world leader, and only your vote counts. Here are the facts about the three leading candidates. 


Candidate A - Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with astrologists He's had two mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day. 


Candidate B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening. 


Candidate C - He is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, drinks an occasional beer and never cheated on his wife. 
v
Which of these candidates would be your choice? 


Decide first, no peeking, then scroll down for the answer. 











Candidate A is Franklin D. Roosevelt. 


Candidate B is Winston Churchill. 


Candidate C is Adolph Hitler. 


And, by the way, the answer to the abortion question: If you said Yes, you just killed Beethoven. 


Pretty interesting isn't it? Makes a person think before judging someone. Never be afraid to try something new. 


Remember: Amateurs built the ark. Professionals built the Titanic 


Can you imagine working for a company that has a little more than 500 employees and has the following statistics: 


29 have been accused of spousal abuse 


7 have been arrested for fraud 


19 have been accused of writing bad checks 


117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least 2 businesses. 


3 have done time for assault 


71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit 


14 have been arrested on drug-related charges 


8 have been arrested for shoplifting 


21 are currently defendants in lawsuits 


84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year 


Can you guess which organization this is? Give up yet? 


It's the 535 members of the United States Congress. The same group of idiots that crank out hundreds of new laws each year designed to keep the rest of us in line."

"event","Not going to count the pidgeys before they hatch but it looks like my gym leader app got accepted for PAX Prime?  Hopefully meaning I get to wander around and people will challenge me and those who win will get a little pin or ""badge."" HOW EXCITING.  There's limits since not everybody who challenges is going to be a tourney fag, but either way I'm super stoked.


Going with the normal type since I can use the name ""AVERAGE JO"" Hurrhurr. And trying to narrow down the team from these guys. <sub>Thanks Dee for the imaging tips!</sub>

"event","Tagged and posting here instead of dA since I'm using that journal to whore myself out for commissions.<br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""OH FUCK MEMES"">MEME NUMERO ICHI<br /><br />1) First list all your OC&rsquo;s by first name so we can see your list of all your wonderful OC&rsquo;s.<br /><br />1) Nicolas<br />2) Kuro<br />3) Kara<br />4) Hase<br />5) Suyin<br />6) Broccoli<br />7) Fizz<br />8) Mims<br />9) Dante<br />10) Hotaka<br /><br />2) Who is your favorite OC?<br />I think its a tie between all of them.<br /><br />3) Who is your least favorite?<br />I think its a tie between none of them.<br /><br />4) Who is your most developed?<br />Ohgod uh its a tossup between Nick, Hase and Kuro.<br /><br />5) Which OC would you want to date if they magically came to life?<br />LOL How narcissistic!  I'd say Hotaka since he is a pretty nice legal aged guy.  Eh kills people and makes food and doesn't afraid of anything.<br /><br />6) How many girl OCs do you have? Boy OCs? It OCs?<br />Too damn many!  I mean-<br /><br />Girls: 4<br />Boys: 5<br />Genderless: 1<br /><br />7) If you were stuck in a burning building what do you think the third OC on your list would do?<br />She would probably be the one who started the fire.  And then in her half hazard explosively effortless way, blow stuff up until she reaches the exit while I barely make it out.<br /><br />8) Name one thing you regret about one of your OCs.<br />That many of them are based off of some cartoon show.<br /><br />9) Which of your OCs do you think would make the best father/mother/it parent out of all your OCs and why??<br />Oh Nick would make the best dad since it's his job to raise things in the first place.  And he does want to be a father one day....sometime far in the future.<br /><br />Suyuin would make the best mom because well, she is one!<br /><br />10) Which of your OCs do you think will most likely be put in jail?<br />Probably Dante, though it wouldn't be intentional.  He'd just get possessed by some horrible felon ghost and do terrible things without his knowing.<br /><br />11) The eighth of your OCs was put into the future! What will their job be?!?<br />Mims is old!  He already has a job owning a pet store and would probably be CRUSTIER and retired.<br /><br />12) Name the first OCs catch phrase! (if they don&rsquo;t have one just make one up)<br />&quot;Howdy!&quot;<br /><br />13) Do all your OCs live together or are they separated?<br />Hurp derp<br /><br />Nick and Broccoli are sort of set in the same world and might on the off chance run in to each other but nope!<br /><br />Kara, Kuro, Suyin and Hotaka are also set in the same universe.  None of them live together but Kara and Kuro crash at each other's places frequently and Hotaka spends way more time at Suyin's place than he should. <br /><br />14) Are there any pairings that are in your OC list? (they can&rsquo;t be with someone else's)<br />Nope!  They're all either partnered with someone else, are too old, too young or asexual.<br /><br />15) Your seventh OC switched bodies with you for a day! How will they react at the end of the day?<br />BLAGHASGHARGH *runs off a cliff*<br /><br />16) Your last OC just became a fifteen year old. What do they do?<br />He'd probably laugh at being a skinny punk all over again.  He would also crack up at his terrible bleached hairstyle.<br /><br />17) Now randomly select a person on your OC list. Who was it?<br />Hase!<br /><br />18) That OC you just chose? Yeah they think they are superman (even if they are a girl) and are on the roof about to jump off.<br />Because his brother pushed him off.  Poor guy!<br /><br />19) Are any of your OCs bored of this meme?<br />Probably.<br /><br />20) Would your second OC prefer the beach or the mountains?<br />Kuro would prefer to stay indoors.  But mountains because it has no fish.<br /><br />21) Would your tenth OC battle a shark?<br />FUCK YEAH PUNCH IT IN THE FACE SUZUKI STYLE.<br /><br />22) Which OCs hate each other?<br />None of them. o_o They're a pretty mellow bunch.<br /><br />23) Which OC did you create first? And last?<br />Nick was first interestingly enough, back from 2004-05ish when he stabbed things instead of being a farmer.  And ironically Mims, the old man, is the newest, created sometime this year.<br /><br />25) And if those two were fighting, who would win?<br />FFFFFFF Nick is spry and young and fresh.  Mims is old and crusty but is not a twig and had military training.  But neither of them are really brawlers. o_o  I CALL A TIE<br /><br />26) Are your OCs fat or skinny?<br />I'd like to think I've got good range.  Most are pretty average BUT:<br /><br />-Nick is skinny/lanky.<br /><br />-Kuro has a little muscle, probably the most average of the bunch.  Not really fat or skinny.<br /><br />-Kara has a bit on the pudgy/curvy side <br /><br />-Hase is actually supposed to be kind of emaciated but I can't get his face quite right.<br /><br />-Suyin is lean and kind of has the &quot;ply board with nails&quot; figure but has a good deal of muscle.<br /><br />-Broccoli also kind of has baby fat but only in her face really.  The rest of her is pretty average.<br /><br />-Fizz and Dante both have also  babyfat left over since they're still very young.<br /><br />-Mims is a fatty.<br /><br />-Hotaka is beefy<br /><br />27) What are your first 2 OC's favorite foods?<br />Nick LOVESLOVESLOVES waffles.  That's practically all he eats and it's a wonder he's not fat.  Kuro will never admit it but he's a huge sucker for manapua/pork bun and will love anyone forever if they buy it for him.<br /><br />28) If your listed OCs were in a fight to the death, who would emerge victorious?<br />Lolololol WELL- I'd say it'd be narrowed down between Hotaka, Fizz and Kara just because of their sheer brute strength and recklessness when it comes to being in a fight.  Probably Kara because she'd just blow up everyone.<br /><br />29) There's a zombie attack and your OCs are stranded. Who do they elect to be their leader?<br />Mims or Suyin.  Mims has more experience for crazy situations but Suyin is way more down to earth.<br /><br />30) During said zombie attack, who's the first to die?<br />Broccoli unless pokeymons are allowed.  Poor girl.<br /><br />31) Tag three or more people!<br />Your mom<br />Your mom's face<br />Your mom's ass<br /><br />MEME NUMERO NI<br /><br />A. List seven habits/quirks/facts about yourself.<br />B. Tag seven people to do the same.<br />C. Do not tag the person who tagged you or <strike>say that you tag &quot;whoever wants to do it.&rdquo;</strike>Fuck off I'm gonna do just that.<br /><br />1.  I <i>need</i> to draw something at least once a day, if I don't I get kind of twitchy and moody.  I would blame art school but it has always kind of been like this, just not to that extent.<br /><br />2.  Cooking is something I find enjoyable.  Food is fascinating and I love experimenting with stuff, so to be able to eat your experiments is something pretty awesome.<br /><br />3.  Speaking of food, I kind of have an oral fixation of sort.  I run though packs of gum faster than a chain smoker cause I need to be chewing something most of the time, or I will start biting my nails and get worms or something. Or make food and get fat LOL.<br /><br />4.  Developing characters to the point where I come up with creepy incredibly obscure random facts is something I find enjoyable.<br /><br />5.  I paint my toenails vivid, eye searing colors around once a month.  Currently it is lime green and neon pink.<br /><br />6.  I wear slippers in horribly cold weather because I like them that much.<br /><br />7.  About a week ago I got is a crowntail betta named La-Ve.  He's pretty plain by betta standards but has these awesome ORANGE AND BLUE EYES so that totally makes up for it.<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />"

Without them, you would wilt and fade away. Too much time alone leave you feeling listless and sad, but a good night out with your buddies puts the spring back into your step. You make friends easily, because you know how to adjust your behaviour for each person. With a rowdy, loud, social type of person you can be rowdy, and loud, and social. With a timid and mousy person you can be quiet and sensitive. While you have many friends and many faces, you have an inner circle of friends and family with whom you can truly be yourself.</p>
<p>You are a natural leader. You tend to be calm and rational, and it is rare that you get angry or upset. Often, when someone accidentally hurts your feelings, you will smile and pretend not to be bothered by it, because you want to project a positive, self confident image. You pick your battles. When someone does cross the line, they are often surprised at the sudden strength of your defensive attack. On the rare occasion that someone evokes anger or tears from you, it seems to them that this storm burst from clear blue skies.</p>
<p>Your daemon would represent your social, outgoing nature, your adaptable presence, and your tendency to hide your sensitive spots from strangers. He or she would help you mold yourself to every variety of social situation, being calm or playful or frightening as each situation demanded. When alone together, he or she would be someone whom you could share your real feelings with.</p>

SO!  Break is almost over, boo!  Well about one year left to go until our class graduates, meaning once this semester starts up, we're gonna be seniors.  RRRGGGGHH!  Um break was fun I guess, though everybody left right when Cyndi and I came over and BK/Keemfag/Jelleh/Chanae was busy with work but it was still nice to not have to get up early.

RECAP TEIM

-Getting pwned by zombies, mainly with Lina. xD
-HAPUNAAA!  Justin, Chanae and I found this cave of groovyness and pretended to be shipwrecked turned cavemen folk.  Also watching Justin getting swirled around by the tide like some Hawaiian turd in the toilet that was the ocean was hilarious.
-Pwning some demons in Okami!
-Sort of working, not really.
-Re-learning the ukulele again.  I haven't touched that thing since the 4th grade.  It's so much easier than the guitar because I CAN ACTUALLY REACH ALL THE STRINGS. xD  Currently only know two songs though. Whoooo.
-Awesome convos with teh Karu.
-Keem n Jelleh being (awesome) dumbfucks as usual.
-Ken's House of Pancakes.
-WE HAVE A ROOSTER!  My Uncle found it and gave it to Dad.  His name is Bobo, I call him Bob for short and will be very surprised if he lasts a semester without getting pwned by the feral cat family that roams our neighborhood.  But really, we have a papaya tree and a dog, now all we need is a goat and we can be a stereotypical Filipino house. xD
-Tropic Thunder Pineapple Express YEAH!
-Um...mustache?"

And though tired, she was quite functional and if all goes well she should be out of ICU in a couple of days and in about a week or so, out of the hospital completely.  I'm not a religious person but I thank whomever or whatever is taking care of her.  So everyday until Saturday, which is when I go back, dad and I going to visit her.

EDITEDITEDITEDIT!  I also found some photoage leaked from the comic con about the Watchmen movie: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsDzH05cL8c"">Take a look at it</a>

So yeah, the Watchmen panel was my favorite, I can't wait for it!  The Heroes panel was dang sweet too, the line was over a mile long though.  Was it worth it?  Fuck yeah seaking!  Spent tons of money way more than I should have including getting up the Nightcrawler miniseries, some delicious yaoi for Jeff, bleach books for telleh that were SUPPOSED to get signed but I was a stupid bitch and decided to get food and the room filled up.  D: Also the avatar panel was hilarious, they showed the finale again but I just love the creators, they're hilarious jackasses not even kidding.  We got teeshirts from them that smelled like tuna.  I also got the man who does cartoons for playboy to draw something in my sketchbook that was cute.

There's tons more of stuff but that's the main cool things."

Fourth of July was awesome, Dad n I had roman candle wars which is incredibly stupid but still fun, a firecracker also exploded in my hand, that wasn't so much fun.  So I just blew up stuff with my other hand for a while. Mom doesn't like fireworks so she just stayed in the car.  Sad.  I am glad they enjoyed themselves though.  We went to FORT WORDEN HOLY COW! It was super relaxing and stuff, just had a picnic and slept mostly.  They also got me like 1000 pounds of leftovers and lychee sake which is delicious and frikken deadly.  It tastes like the Smirnoffs in the sense it's like juice, but it's just as potent as regular sake, plus it goes down super easy.  God my parents rock so hard.

Today I spent time with random people from the apartment complex, and learned that my ""guardian angel"" is apparently a penis with wings. LOL Thanks Jayna.  As a result we drew hilarious penis pictures in class and got angry looks from Dan Dunlap.  I was laughing so hard I was crying.  That hasn't happened in ages.

And this weekend, I'm going to hang out with Kensuke and later my Aunty in Tacoma.  Wish me luck!

Parents are coming over this weekend I'm super excited, gotta clean up the apartment so Dad doesn't rampage and clean everything. xD  I plan on taking them to this place called ""Fort Warden"" which has a beach and fields and a working lighthouse!  In addition to Seattle of course.

Spanky got all fixed up but now I'm short of a lot of cash and the rent/bills will be due soon.  Bah!  Money always causes problems.  It would also help if one of the roomies paid her share on time. *cough cough*

Also I scuffed my toe during sparring last, last week, the sucker is still swollen and it feels weird to walk.  I'm pretty sure it's sprained.  Oh well.

Lastly I got to bond with the cousin during the weekend, I missed her she's so awesome.  We stalked things and went to the beach and competed on getting stars with Mario DS.  Aunty made bacon for breakfast and took us to eat Cajun food for dinner.  I love the stuff but I think it was a little too rich for me.  Speaking of which she's getting better, I think she's done with chemotherapy and is finishing up her radiation treatment.  I'm glad she's feeling well.  Overall, twas fun, I love my family. <3"

"event","So as always, the trip back to Hilo was super nice.  I was sad that Aloha and ATA airlines (both local) went out of business not to mention that the airline fares shot up so I couldn't go O'ahu to go visit my niece but other than that was good fun!  Here's a quick list of some the things good and bad that happened over the break.<br /><br />1. Hapuna visit!  Found out that I can indeed drive for a few hours even after a day at the beach.  Best day of the break EVER!  We even got to eat malasadas, and other good foods like spam musubi and kalbi at the beach, listen to the Becky and Justin radio show on  the way back and catch waves. (well sort of haha) Also we saw Guy over there and helped him dig this huge hole in the sand.  And for once there wasn't tons of people so we could frolic more than usual.  Then we went over to Osakas and had good food but my chigae tasted weird so Becky gave me some of hers. &lt;33 All in all that was the highlight of the break.<br /><br />2. Relax like a lazy ass.  Cause that's what break is all about yeah?<br />3. Eat shave ice.  With some tasty guava sorbet and go swimming too.<br />4. Cut like a foot of my hair off and put pink streaks in thar.<br />5. Turn 20. Brah, back when I was young....<br />6. Learn deep dark secrets about friends so you'll have trouble looking at them the same way for a long time.<br />7. See my cat and dog, Koko and Gobo. &lt;3<br />8. Pick up trying to learn the guitar again. Ty bk for being such a good teacher! ;_;  Now I just gotta find a place to buy one cheap over here.<br />9. Catch up on the Hilo dramas and learn some good insults from Justin.<br />10. Finally beat that stupid water temple in Twilight Princess thanks to Jaff.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""And because I can here's some pictures from the Hapuna trip cut for your convenience""><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mcpimplez/pic/0000sy33/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mcpimplez/pic/0000sy33/s320x240"" /></a> <br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mcpimplez/pic/0000tebf/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mcpimplez/pic/0000tebf/s320x240"" /></a> <br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mcpimplez/pic/0000wfs6/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mcpimplez/pic/0000wfs6/s320x240"" /></a><br />Ami, Becky and I in that order.

Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon/ Ganbare Goemon <b>Ebisumaru: </b>He's a fat ninja who likes dancing more than sneaking and is so crack he makes my brain hurt.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. X-men: <b>Nightcrawler</b>: If for nothing else, his character design.&nbsp; I like the older versions of him were he was a flirty swashbuckling goofball but him being serious (and religious I guess) is pretty sick.<br /><br />3. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (this is a tie sort of) <b>Viral and Kittan: </b>Viral, holy crap this guy is just about everything I love in a smashed into one good thing.&nbsp; Badass but a loser, has&nbsp; a sweet secret and looks hella cool, not to mention his voice actor is Link. *_*&nbsp; Kittan is so gar it's insane.&nbsp; I think he's the only character in that show who can rival and possibly beat Kamina in manliness-YES I WENT THERE!&nbsp; Plus he's a big brother, I love big brother characters. &lt;3<br /><br />4. The Mario games <b>Luigi:</b> Fuck. Yeah.&nbsp; He is the best character in the universe.&nbsp; (at least for me) Don't argue or I will eat your face.<br /><br />5. Azumanga <b>Yukari:</b>&nbsp; She leaves me in stitches.&nbsp; I love her jackassery and just over all angry crack humor.&nbsp; Also Yukarimobile ftw.<br /><br />6. Air Gear <b>Akito/Agito:&nbsp; </b>Cute and batshit insane.&nbsp; Just the way I like it.<br /><br />7. CAPTAIN PLANET! Okay I admit I just put it up there to be stupid. ._.<br /><br />8. Naruto<b> Kankuro: </b>Yeah it was pretty obvious not like I use an avatar of him all the time.&nbsp; Also protective older sibling, plus he looks weird but also cool.<br /><br />9. Bleach <b>Ichimaru Gin: </b>He's a huge freaking jerk but at the same time not.&nbsp; I love it!<br /><br />10. Reborn (this is a three way tie) <b>Yamamoto, Gokudera and Lambo:&nbsp; </b>YamaGoku = OTP! OTP!&nbsp; And Lambo is a triple deal, totally whoopass when he's 25, handsome but still a crybaby at 15 and stupid and cute with a giant afro at 5.<br /><br />11. Pokemon!! Not the trainers (also a tie) <b>Squirtle and Wortortle: </b>They are so cute. Nuff said.<br /><br />12. DragonBall Z <b>Gohan:</b> He was such a cute kid and then turned hella cool in the cell saga.&nbsp; After that he sucked. :&lt;<br /><br />13. Ronin Warriors (anyone remember this show??) <b>Cye: </b>A level headed, water using British guy.&nbsp; Pretty cool if you ask me.&nbsp; Also when I was younger I always thought he and Kento were gay for each other. O_o;;;;;&nbsp; A yaoi fangirl without even realizing it. <br /><br />14. Teen Titans <b>Beastboy: </b>Yeah he's pretty great.<br /><br />15. Kikaider. &lt;3 <b>Ichiro:</b> I liked his spunk in the anime, it brought some life in for a very serious show.<br /><br />Shoot, I just realized I'm going to be 20 tomorrow.

"event","So yeah Sakura con was really fun.  Lots of window shopping and lusting after weird anime accessories but not actually buying them.  Well aside from these sweet ass goggles I found at one of the stands.  It was way over priced but I finally got a pair!  So yeah I'm happy. &lt;3  I also got an Endling print since Dave was there again this year yadda yadda no one cares.  Was going to see the Dark Horse people too but Ali Project &gt; Them.  So there!<br /><br />Cousin Megan, Cyndi and I also went to the ""singles meet and greet"" for shits and giggles, and though we didn't go out of our way to talk to anyone since we were there to watch the awkwardness of it all, I got hit on by this really creepy tall guy.  I ended up telling him that I was from Canada and that my dad was an escapee from North Korea....Well I thought it was funny.<br /><br />And meeting the AF peeps..well the awesome ones anyway was way fun.  We saw some of the weirdest and most beautiful things there.  Seriously!<br /><br />Lets recap:<br /><br />Surprise buttsecks L!  Holy crap that was <strike>funny</strike> traumatizing.  This tiny little L runs up to some guy unzips his pants, humps him in the butt and then runs away.  Surprise buttsecks!  The more I think about it the more awesome it gets.<br /><br />Drag queens!  Beautiful, beautiful drag queens!  Inga!  We love you!  During the Ali Project concert (which was also way fun btw) they had drag queens dancing on the stage.  And not only were they dancing, but then they stripped, then threw confetti all over the place then proceeded to do the robot.  HOW RAD IS THAT?<br /><br />Saggy cheeks/Old lady Faye.  This was wrong on so many levels.  It didn't help that she was standing right in front of us during the concert so I kept catching sight of her ""cheeks"" every so often.  It was funny in the sense that it was scarring.<br /><br />Yet another old lady, she had to be 60 at least.  This time she was dressed in some sort of ball gown outfit with a very elaborate mask.  I kind of wanted to hug her. O_O<br /><br />Also there was Pedobear and his shooping buddy and a whole host of other cool cosplayers but those two were particularly lulzy.  I wonder if they went to the 4chan meet.<br /><br />By the way now whenever I see ramen or anything of the sort I will forever more hear ""SODIUM DEATH!"" In my head. xD  Yeah that's pretty great.<br /><br />I'll upload pictures in a bit but that's all for now.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""And to round it off, a meme."">1.

Sean also entered Jayna and I into the Brawl tourney, just watch my ass will be grass.  Then we get to loiter around Gamestop for the next few hours until the midnight release.  Sweeeeeeet!  Cyndi was going to enter too but then she remembered she has dignity.

Speaking of Brawl, winter brawl is almost done and she better win!exclimationoneone111

Also I'm almost done being sick, I almost went a full year without getting ill and then my immune system decides to crash, how lame.  Oh well it had to happen sooner or later.

Lastly Sakura con is coming up pretty soon. Who's excited?  I SURE AM! *does a jig*  Be on the look out for a generic school girl with tonfas if you're going.

OH YES!  I has a question, my hamster won't stop chewing it's fucking cage and it's driving me insane.  Does anyone have an idea to try make it quit doing that?  I have several different chew snacks in there, I feed it, let run around in its hamster ball for long periods of time.  Also I've tried poking it, when it chews and slathering the cage with Tabasco sauce and the damn thing keeps persisting.  Any ideas?"

It has a pool which makes me so very happy because the lack of water around here makes me sad.  It also has a sauna which is totally rad and I'm planning to spend a lot of time in there. *happy frolic*

Also thanks to Sean I finally got my Wii, his name is Stevie and he's very awesome.  I had to leave him at Hako's apartment cause the TV at our house isn't working but that's ok.  It was funny though cause when I went over to visit they made about 40 something Miis LOL.  Included in the Mii list is the Heroes cast, the Chuck cast, some from Genshiken, some from Invader Zim, Kuromaru, Trevor, Dr. Tran and Lelan's Grandma, Jesus, Black Jesus, Jeff, BK, Black Santa and then some.  It's MADNESS!

Black Jesus is also very good at baseball, bastard keeps catching my outfielders. 

I'm so excited to finally be able to play Twilight Princess too. *_* And Brawl when it finally comes out.

As always there's lot of homework to do but who cares?  I'm going to go frolic happily for a little while.

So everyone how was your new years/christmas/whatever?  I got some monies for a wii since my parents couldn't find one and gave me a box with a picture of Michelle Wie saying ""So I heard you wanted a Wie."" It's really funny in retrospect.  Also got to eat the yearly treat of mochi with kinako and sugar.  That stuff is so good!  I wish we could have it more often.

As always there's the new years resolutions we all make but never keep.  Lets write it down anyway.

1. Get some self confidence
2. Stop swearing so much (failing at that)
3. Draw MOAR!
4. Draw different things!
5. Learn to eat more stuff..like potatoes
6. Stop procrastinating so much. 
7. GET THAT WII!  And kick some butt!
8. Stop being such a jerk.
9. Get in shape.
10. Stop being a niggerfaggot.
11. Cling to my buddies like saran wrap because I love them so much. (no joke, bros before hos yo')
12. Move into a nice apartment with Cyndi and Sarah...like liberty ridge.  It has a pool! D:
13. Stop being a weirdo. (also failing at that)

To round things off here's a WIP of yet another stupid portrait of Kuro again.

So I lost my round in the winter brawl, but it's cool.  Yeah I'm a little upset but honestly I knew it was coming, plus I really need to work on other more important stuff.  I think I had better art, but his stuff was better just in general. 


But what bothers me is how the heck did merchant make it past the second round?  Honestly I don't think his stuff is all that funny, it's over done and his artwork is well....it could use a lot of improvement.  Both of them had decent pace but zombie had a much better entry overall.   There are some other entries that I'm rather irritated about that made when their opponent's one was better but that's the one I'm really miffed about.  Glad I'm out of that tournament if they're going to use inconsistent, lousy judging, fuck that shit."

It let me do lots of catching up on my homeworks and internet social life.<br /><br />So did anyone see the Heroes finale?  I was so sad, they killed my favorite female character and another cool guy! *sobs*  Why do all the characters I get atattched to die?  Well at least Hiro and Mr. Bennett are still alive.

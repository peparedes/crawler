"event","I've decided to do a 'software update' on my life like how blackie from time to time prompts me to do. 

Will (Vers 1.14) :
1. I've moved out of my parents' place and now lives in newton with two great friends as housemates. 
2. There is now blackie2 and white2. 
3. Siggy.
4. My career has taken two baby steps. 
5. There is a new person in my life. 
6. Many new apples. 
7. Dr John

Rather depressing actually. I don't think I've make much progress since then except that my wallet is much lighter."

"event","Just happened to read someone's blog today and decided to check if my blog here still exists. And it does. I thought that since I haven't even logged on for two and a half years now, surely, LJ would have removed the account. Well, I decided to read through the whole thing (didn't take long, there were only 11 entries) and am amazed at how things have changed for me over the last 2 plus years. So I decided to pluck up my courage and revive the dead squirrel. 

There is no saying how long it will stay alive though but I hope it will be good while it lasts. Perhaps sufficiently long enough to make the next trip down memory lane 2 years down the road enlightening and delightfully nostalgic. Wish me luck! :)"

Xmas Celebration 2005 has officially started. Traditionally, it starts with the one with my jc friends (aka the great cook-out). While, as much as this year's was predicted to be a wash-out, everything turned out quite nicely. A few close friends gathered about the table set up in the garden, feasting on the roast and pasta I laboured on all afternoon. Reviews were good or at least, polite.  

One party down, 5 more to go (not that it's a chore). It's nice to close the year meeting up all your close friends. Strangely how, as a group distances, the agreed date of celebration falls further from actual Xmas day. The next five parties are consolingly close to each other : 23rd dinner, 24th dinner, 25th lunch, 25th dinner and 26th dinner.

Watched 'Pride' with tatt. Despite being a literary person, I have only one thing to say : Love it! Love it! LOVE IT! Need to get my hands on the DVD so that I can relive the whole thing again and again. I wonder if I'll ever have the same ending as Elisabeth and Mr Darcy. Haiz....(dreamy)"

On 10 December 2005, my grandfather celebrated his 80th birthday and at the same time, his 60th anniversary of marriage with my grandmother. In his fullest traditional glory, my house was turned into a gigantic red packet. A bright red tent was erected right in front of the facade of the house and 22 red tables with matching plastic chairs lined the full width of the driveway and the garden. It was a spectacular sight but the lack of a photograph just showed how busy I was that night. Playing host to 200+ guests at my own home was the first for me. Against my better (Western) judgement, I tolerated  the gawdy decor and twin peaks of artificially coloured peach-bread. 

The struggle between asian tradition and western education persisted as the 12-course dinner progressed. I wasn't satisfied with the slow inclusion of red wine into chinese dinners and tried painstakingly to peddle the white alternative to younger guests. Not too bad, the reds were wiped out and only 2 measly whites were left for my Xmas consumption. Somewhere between my 4th and 6th glass of wine, I rose as confidently as I could and clinked my wine glass (with a chopstick!) and proposed a toast to my dear grandparents. What resulted was three neighbourhood-shattering ""yum seng"". Cheena 3 - bravesquirrel - 2. 

Nevertheless, it was a most tiring and interesting night.. one to be remembered for quite a while."

Finally got round to putting up the tree. And I must say it was a job well done. At least the best I think I've ever done. I suppose the first light-up marked the start of Xmas preparation and a blinding reminder to get off my ass and start working on the List. The List, the proverbial record of who has been naughty or nice, is never as simple as it seems. It demands a delicate balance between the strain of my stretched finances and who should go on the list. It is a time where one considers all his friends and evaluate the 'closeness'. A consideration of whether the friendship points chalked up a decade ago have expired. Happy are those whose lists keep growing though $omething's gotta give. Well, as for me, I've done my best to keep the list as true as possible."

Another weekend came and went and Xmas is drawing so much closer. If there is a nuance of dread in saying that, it's probably intended. I don't think I'll rest easy until all the Xmas shopping is complete. Anyway, had a 'chili crab' dinner with my secondary school buddies. YS and BQ brought lil Nat along. Seems like everyone has grown up (duh) and extending their genetic lines. Just a few weeks ago, I had a 6-hr lunch (one of the first) with 2 pregnant friends. I think very soon the social dynamics will change, I just hope it is for the better. Anyway, back to this weekend, it was Ubin Seafood at Sixth Ave. 

The low-down. Generally, it's like a slightly classier coffee shop offering the usual 'zhi char' stuff. No special request for non-menu entries though. Parking is a killer there but there's free valet if you go early enough. There is shread evidence of some kind of ambience but nothing close to its predecessor at Keppel.

After dinner, went to nearby 'Tea Party' for... what else, tea. It's a heaven for tea-lovers. The range of teas are just phenomenon. Every tea comes with at least 5 different varieties. You could either be spoilt for choice or frustrated over the complexity. ""Now, for your Darjeeling, would you like the Kenilworth or the Estate Ceylon, BOP or FPBOP (whatever!)"" Anyway, I loved it!"

Arghh! Another 6-hr lunch! Man, I really need to stop sinking into the tai-tai lifestyle. Had lunch with my uni cronies at Au Petit Salut...again. I love the place. The snails are to die for. This time, we brought 5 bottles of wines and yes, we polished all of them off. I did a first in ordering Risotto. I really don't fancy anything that resembling puke, but I didn't know what came over me. It was actually quite nice, but don't think I'll be ordering Risotto anytime soon. Mental image problem. 

A little slooshed by mid-afternoon, we adjourned for tea at English Rose Cafe. Somehow, in the whole events of things, I did my next first by going for a MANICURE and PEDICURE with Lena! It was, all in all, a pleasant and pampering experience but kinda feel a little cheated that all I have to show for $50 are glossy nails. Hmmmm, seriously, what was I expecting? Anyway, will probably need to keep my hands in my pockets for the next few days. 

Dinner was as usual, albeit the absence of Isaac and new guest, Mark. Dinner was at Holland V, of course. Spent the whole day there. Feel really guilty.. 6-hr lunch extending into dinnertime. Shiny nails and all. Tomorrow must un-tai myself."

"event","Finally back from ICT. Many of my friends would be glad that there will be none of the usual (and lengthy) complaining sessions consisting of blow-by-blow accounts of how every single activity of the entire ICT went. It lasted for 2 days only. Some SAR-21 conversion course. I suppose it is to 'compensate' for the next ICT (April 06) which will last a good two weeks (Help!). 

End of entry. Don't want to depress myself further by dwelling of NS matters."

"event","I'm getting into a very bad habit. I've had several 6hr lunches this past week. The last one was yesterday where my JC pals and I went for Tim Sum at Li Bai Chinese Restaurant. Everyone's pregnant. Emily's ready to pop and Jer's complaining about getting fat. Hey, pregnancy is the best excuse for getting fat. Ride the wave, I say. Met another JC friend (from AA2 I think), Yinghong and she was with her chubby hubby and a 9 month-old son. We were all green-eyed over her still athletic bod.  Anyway, we left Li Bai after the restaurant emptied  and decided to head down Holland Village to jalan and tea at Cafe 211 cos we couldn't get enough of each other. By the time we parted ways, it was time for my Sunday dinner with my buddies.

The gathering of the three witches was the usual fare... we made some career choices, judged each other's love lives, planned our lives from Xmas all the way till 2007... all in a night's work. Like always, we sat around our cauldrons of tea hoping to make sense of our lives. By the time I got home, it was eleven. Was going to set up Whitey to pen all this down but was interrupted with by a disturbing phonecall (not the caller but the news she brought). Not keen to rehash it here but my point is... No hope of a quiet moment. It is afterall my stand-down period but the irony is that I haven't much opportunity to think through my next move. Frankly there's plenty of things on my 'To-do' list. Sadly, the list is a blurry mess in my head. Hmmm... I think I better stop her and write it down. had better assess the damage from 2 weeks of totally carefree leisure."

"event","My title is indeed true for expectations. I expected that today (18 Nov) would be a good day. I had everything planned. On paper, it seemed eventful enough. However, everything that could go wrong... yup, went horribly wrong. I spend a good half of today struggling with Whitey to manage my blog account. For a techno idiot like myself, it was hell. 

That wasn't all. The climber continues falling.

Finally watched HARRY POTTER. Went with really high expectations. Did the whole get best seats hype. The seats were really good. You could recline the seat and lie down. Blankets were provided but I tried not to think about how long they had been there. Kelv and I ordered drinks at a bar and the drinks were served to us during the movie. Nice touch. Definitely a plus for a 2hr 40min film. A little pricey though. Almost like watching 4 movies. 

GOF was fine, but I kinda killed it for myself by reading the book so recently. I ended up just trying to trace the novel in the movie. Large chunks of the original story was removed (Actual Quiddith Match, Dobby and Winky). To keep the plot together despite omissions, certain parts of the original story was altered (they took a lot of liberation on the final task). On the whole, I guess I still enjoyed the movie. Would definitely enjoyed even more if I didn't raise my expectations sky high (another movie I 'over-expectationed').

Moral of the story... the mountain always looks taller if you are standing at the foot."

"event","Arghh... it took me so long to create the entire blog. Coming up with a name for your blog is really quite mind-boggling. It's almost like naming your own child. Once you've named it, there's no turning back. Worse, coming up with a name that hasn't been taken. The world of blogging seems so established that it is almost impossible to come up with anything. Perhaps I'm limited by my own imagination.

Anyway, I'm finally on the bandwagon! Hip Hip! Hurray!

The wait was long but luckily the telly's on. Watching 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' on HBO. Love Gwyneth Paltrow. I suppose if anyone asks what my favourite pastime is, I would definitely say watching telly. Not that I'll admit to that in a second. There is a certain sense of embarrassment about revealing that nothing pleases you more than vegetating in front of a black box (yup, I still don't own one of those ultra-cool super show-off flat-screen tellys). Nevertheless, I don't think I should hide in the closet anymore.

Hello, my name is Will and I'm a couch potato. 
(Hello, Will!)

I'm working on Blacky at this moment now. Unsure how everything will look like on Whitey. Still finding it very difficult to balance between the two. I love Whitey but don't want to seem to be 'si xing yan jiu'. Afterall, Blacky has been with me for so long. Did think of using Blacky for er.. more entertaining purposes and Whitey for serious work (actually quite ironic if you knew what each was made for) , but that arrangement still needs lots of fine-tuning. The Blacky-Whitey saga continues in my untidy bedroom. I'll be tidying it up tomorrow. 

Tomorrow. Sigh. It was supposed to be the most well-planned day I would have ever had for a very long time. Was all geared up to eat my heart out at the buffet at 'Baccarat'. It's one-for-one and we've been planning this for weeks. However, Mic called me to tell me she had forgotten to make reservations and when she finally did, the place was fully booked. Argh! Sometimes, I wish i could....

one, two, three, four...Ommmmm...

So, tomorrow's lunch is a no-go. Nevermind, at least I'll be watching HARRY POTTER! Hurray, 'Goblet of Fire' is finally finally here. I've been thinking about trying out those fanciful seats at GV Gold Class. What better movie to try it out than with HARRY POTTER! I'm actually quite excited. The reviews (on 8Days) were through the roof. 4 and 1/2 stars! I'll thrilled. Just finished re-reading the book a few days ago. Still an excellent read. Kinda hoping nothing will be left out. But I'm sure stuff will be omitted. To stay true to the book would mean a 6-hr movie (not that many people will complain.. definitely not me... would surely make my $25 ticket well worth it)

Been asked to go Velvet after the movie. Pi and company celebrating Sam's birthday. I doubt I'll be in the mood though. Weekends seem to revolve around clubbing nowadays. Funny that life seems to go in circles. I thought my clubbing days of my distant youth were over. Then came the hibernation phase and now spring has returned but I guess my dancing shoes are still mouldy. Well, will play by ear. 

Sounds like the room-cleaning task will be put off.... again."

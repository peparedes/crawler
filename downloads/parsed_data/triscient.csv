"event","Once there was a man who went out looking for a friend, someone who he could talk to in a sensible manner, someone who would understand what he had to say. He came across such a person and they talked about many things, and he found this person to be very agreeable. He desired to talk to his new friend some more, but the day had drawn on, so they arranged to meet again the next day.

The man and his friend met at the same place every day, and they always had something to talk about. They always discussed, but never argued. He felt that his friend was someone who knew his mind well.

One day the man did not feel well, but he did not like feeling grumpy and miserable, so he went to his friend. When he arrived he did not feel comforted; he found his friend to be unsympathetic and selfish. This upset the man greatly, after all, he had made an effort to see his friend today. He yelled at his friend, and his friend yelled back. His outburst hadn't made him feel any better, and his friend's only made him more aggrivated.

He struck at his friend, but his fist never found its target. Instead it shattered a mirror. The sharp glass shards fell and sundered his wrist, leaving him to bleed out on the floor. Then he realised, much too late, that he had seen himself all along."

<b>I Am A:</b> True Neutral Human Druid/Sorcerer (1st/1st Level)
<br><br><u>Ability Scores:</u><br>
<b>Strength-</b>16<br>
<b>Dexterity-</b>14<br>
<b>Constitution-</b>15<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>16<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>17<br>
<b>Charisma-</b>15
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>True Neutral</b> A true neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. He doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most true neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil after all, he would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, he's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way. Some true neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run. True neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion. However, true neutral can be a dangerous alignment because it represents apathy, indifference, and a lack of conviction.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Druids</b> gain power not by ruling nature but by being at one with it. They hate the unnatural, including aberrations or undead, and destroy them where possible. Druids receive divine spells from nature, not the gods, and can gain an array of powers as they gain experience, including the ability to take the shapes of animals. The weapons and armor of a druid are restricted by their traditional oaths, not simply training. A druid's Wisdom score should be high, as this determines the maximum spell level that they can cast.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Sorcerers</b> are arcane spellcasters who manipulate magic energy with imagination and talent rather than studious discipline. They have no books, no mentors, no theories just raw power that they direct at will. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire them more slowly, but they can cast individual spells more often and have no need to prepare their incantations ahead of time. Also unlike wizards, sorcerers cannot specialize in a school of magic. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they have more time to learn fighting skills and are proficient with simple weapons. Charisma is very important for sorcerers; the higher their value in this ability, the higher the spell level they can cast.

"event","It's <lj user=""nerdygridbug"">'s birthday today. I was planning to get her a shiny silver D20 from the place in Brisbane if I could get down there one weekend with my siblings' weekly trip for their orchestra practice. Unfortunately I ended up busy most weekends and they finished for the term on the weekend just gone. So I thought I would just have to get it as a late birthday present for her.

However, <lj user=""whitepantheress""> asked one day what we should get for her birthday. I told her about the D20 and <lj user=""brockulfsen""> piped up saying that he would be in Brisbane the next day and could get it for me.

It arrived in whitepantheress' mailbox today and nerdygridbug asked me via sms if she could open it. I said that I wanted to wrap it first and actually be there when she opens it. So they came over this afternoon and I found a little box and some ribbon and put the present inside (since it had to be done right there and then :p ). She unwrapped it and pretty much went ""zomg squee &lt;3"". ^_^

Anyway, back to it. My last assignment for the semester is driving me crazy. >_<

P.S. My heart beats in time to Vanilla. O_o"

1. Register a change in the candle (*punch* wait, what?)
2. Realise flame has gone out (omg wtf?)
3. ^_^

Now to do it from further away, don't know how long that will take to achieve."

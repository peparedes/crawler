"event","im in florida now. im  starting to like the idea of moving around and seeing so many different  things, but as much as everything changes, everything stays the same.  I talk to  so many different people and have the same fucking conversations.  Thats what i miss about being settled in one place, you get to know everything.  I get used to something and when it changes i start to miss it.  i even miss the things i hated about where i was.  
the base here in florida is nice, theres a lot of things to do and a lot of money to be blown on things i dont need.  Its not that im totally unrestricted, its just the comparison to great lakes that makes me feel so much more comfortable here.  im starting to wish i could stay longer, but then i remember that after this is over i get to come home."

I went shopping on the miracle mile, and listened to people so rich that they talked about things i couldnt understand.  Of couse i had to stop at the Navy pier, which is this huge disgusting tourist trap, but aside from that it was nice.  While i was there two japanese tourists came and had me take a picture with them, i guess because i was in uniform and its the ""navy"" pier.  It really has nothing to do with the military anymore.  i got my picture with them as well, because japanese tourists should be a tourist attraction."

why interracial marriage is wrong.
why black and mexican people would be nothing without white people.
why the things white people invented were more important that the things blacks and mexicans invented.
And, why white people are smarter than them both.

i watched thier faces while they nodded, understanding that if they told the white guy how full of shit he was they would lose thier jobs.  this was two seventeen year old kids with futures being talked down to by a thirty year old man in a dead end job, and the man was speaking in ebonics while he was doing it.

"event","This weekend is blurry. It had valentines day in it, so its good that its blurry. I'm convinced the whole thing was one big friday night.  Lee came and got me from work with a girl named allie.  We crashed at her sisters place that night.  The snow was beautiful, and because we were drunk it was more beautiful.  The neighborhood has a million trees and they were all coated with snow.  
   I spent the early part of valentines day with Jonathan.  I've never seen Him so broken up; Usually he collects all my pieces and puts them back together with me, now i should be helping him but i can't help myself. I hope its not forever this time, but nothing seems to be changing.
   Some really dumb really giggly girls picked me and sean up from his place.  Jonathan stayed.  They drank while they drove, and they drove too fast. we went to a party with people i hate but the beer was free so i didnt complain.  liana was there and so was brandon.  Good to see them.  Lee and sean (rauh) showed up, sow e went back to my place and watched a movie. 
   After work sunday i finally washed my car.  Paige got me some pizza, and now i am forever grateful to her.  Then we went to seans, got trashed, went to jessi's, came home, and everyone passed out.  I stayed up and watched the royal tennenbaums again.  
   The sleep i got sunday was the best sleep ive had in a few months.  i didnt want to wake up.  It should have been monday morning forever."

There was a crack running right near my gums with a little blood running out.  When i finally opened my mouth my teeth fell out all over the bathroom counter.  All that was left were the roots, and it hurt like hell if they touched anything so i couldn't close my mouth.  I woke up early and ate    breakfast. Fuck having no teeth. 
  I also watched waking life last night. Thanks paige. I spent a lot of time admiring the art but i was also trying to pay attention the movie in its whole.  I think i'll watch it once with no volume. And im sure as hell buying the soundtrack.  Its not the kind of movie that you cant sleep after, but it was damn good."

Got off work friday around eight. Picked up lee and paige.  Went to waffle house.  The law of conservation of Mass.  Past Relationships.  Law of Thermodynamics.  Ghosts. Went to Mansfield for no reason. Nothing happened. Went home. Watched Forest Gump. Went to sleep at three.

Saturday I woke up at seven thirty.  Worked out.  Ran a couple miles. Got new tires.  Met the ladies at the mall. We came back to my house.  Bullshitted. Went to Johns. Bought some Bud Light.  Got really stoned off contact.  Drove around.  Talked like mexicans.  Ate pizza. Laughed A lot.

Got to Dylan and Shea's place around Ten.  Drunk by eleven.  Stumbled around.  Talked to old friends.  Met a girl named Jayme.  Bullshitted.  Smoked too much.  Bummed out too many.  Sent lee and sean after more cigarettes. Talked to Misty. We ended up together by the end of the night.  Justin snores. And sort of stole my car.  And told me he threw my shoe out the Window.  Never fell asleep, but had a hangover.  Rested my head on a piece of wood for four hours.

Im not sure how the fuck any of that happened.  But i guess it was a nice change. Two days off in a row."

"event","so i went home for easter weekend and i'm glad that i did so...

this morning for easter my mommy had me go on an easter egg hunt when i woke up which i'm not going to lie was a lot of fun...then we also baked cookies today which i haven't done in forever so i'm glad that i got to do so....

some other things happened but i really dont' want to get into detail about them because they really weren't for the better...but it's ok because i wasn't going ot let it ruin my extremely short weekend home....

so i realized how much in some ways that i missed home and i'm glad that i came home...and in some perspectives i dont' want to leave right now(and you know who you are who knows exactly what this is about and why)...but i just have to keep telling my self that i will be back in a short time(4 weeks) and all will be well..and i just have to remember to enjoy my last four weeks of my freshmen year...because i will never be able to go back!"

"event","i'm definitely tired right now...but i can't sleep...it could possibly be because i took about a three hour nap today..i was completely a waste of space today...and that's all i have been today is a waste of space and life...i hope that everyone else has had a great day...i have been cleaning and everything else...it's been great fun..."

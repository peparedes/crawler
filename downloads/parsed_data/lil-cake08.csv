"event","wow. i am soo tired i just got home from band camp which was fun except for the whole marching part. i am so sore and i want to go to bed. christi our flag coach is not coming back unless she gets like $300. it was sooo sad i am going to miss her soo much. everybody cried. im sorta glad band camp is over because of all the drama it was pretty much like school cause pretty much everybody cried. it was probably better than last years but we didnt get to have a shaving cream fight and the seniors didnt get to trash the field. but we had fun in our cabin playing pranks on each other.im going to go to bed and get some sleep so see ya later."

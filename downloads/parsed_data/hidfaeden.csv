My ex has a new person. I&nbsp;want to be happy for him, but I&nbsp;can't. I just want him to fail and fall hard.

It's like he's a different person from when I&nbsp;first fell in love with him. It's fucking annoying."

Yesterday was his birthday, and I made him breakfast. I wish I did more, but I'm also bleeding and I think I messed up my pill, but I want to so bad, and I know he does, too. I wish I could satisfy him, like he does me, but I can't. 

I wish I could flip the switch in my brain to make me pleasure him more."

"event","So mi amore really ticked me off earlier today.

I finish working for my main job, and I call him to see what he wants for dinner. While on the phone, I hear his music and I know he's on the computer playing his game. I ask him some questions and it's like he's barely even paying any attention to me. When I first asked him to check something for me in the fridge, he looks quickly and gives me the wrong answer then goes back to playing. I ask him something else, and I know he didn't even get off his chair because the music volume didn't lessen. So I just bye and hung up. It's fucking rude...

Then, I get home and start making food, and I forget what set us off, but he started on how he sometimes feels like I don't care about him and his worries. I had to bite my tongue and lip to stop from crying, because I do care, and if anything, he was the one who didn't care about me and my problems. I'm going through the same shit he is, and I have a few added bonuses thanks to my job. Plus, when he keeps bringing up certain things, it only breaks my sanity bubble more. He left the kitchen and I just started crying while working on dinner. 

The cat knew I was crying and came to comfort me, just like always. I wanted to bend down and hold her, but if I did, I knew he would've seen me crying and come to me all worried and shit or whatever. I hate being seen crying, even though the best time to let it all go is when you're in someone's arms. I'm blaming my PMS for all this.

I managed to stop crying by the time he came in. I just wanted to tell him to go away and go back to his game, since he practically plays that instead of giving me any love. I heard a member of his party do a common spell and I tried giving him a hint of how I felt by saying, ""I think your party is waiting for you,"" but of course he didn't get it. It's only been pretty recent that I've been feeling like he'd rather talk to his gaming or other online friends than me. I know it's not true, but when he goes to his computer chair instead of sitting next to me on the couch for dinner, it still hurts.

I wish I could talk to him, just tell him everything about him and what he does that pisses me off, but I can't. And I think that if I did, he'd flip out on me, or something. I don't know, he's different. But he is really stressed out thanks to work and moving, and he said it himself that his fuse is shorter. I just can't wait for all this shit to end. 

I just want to stay in his arms."

"event","Yesterday was a bitch. I couldn't stop feeling depressed because I crashed my car yesterday morning. 

Some times I feel like such a failure, like all I do is get speeding tickets or just flat out crash my damn car. My license is theoretically getting suspended on Friday, and I'm just now taking care of the shit for it. Tomorrow I'm heading down to take my ""retraining"" class. It'll only be one class of 4 hours of video. My best-friend says that I should be ok with it all. The same thing happened to her boyfriend and he waited too long, but his license was never suspended. Either way, I'm fretting like a mo-fo. If my license does get suspended, there's a 175 dollar fee I have to pay. I guess when I first got the letter, my eyes overlooked that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken my bloody time. 

It's really aggravating that every time we're finally able to save some money, something happens and we're back to being near broke again. I can't wait for us to move. I'm sick of living with my roommates. Mi amore always feels uncomfortable when one of them comes downstairs (or upstairs) and we have to deal with them. It's like we're not good enough roomies for them, we're either too dirty or messy or whatever. I'm really hoping it'll be better when we move in with my best-friend and her bf."

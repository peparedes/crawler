"event","Tonight, I am at my all time low.<br /><br />The world is so small and everyone is interconnected and at times like this, I wish I am part of the linkages. On the surface, some looked so much happier than the others and just that facade is enough to arouse a tinge of envy that would last throughout the night.<br />Before 15, we can probably live our lives in the wildest manner, with the most nonchalant attitude but come 16, there will be no time to play, no time to waste for every single moment will affect the future. Every minute spend daydreaming, shopping, fooling around, dating, lazing around can be used for studying and produce good results and events will slowly fall into places; good results, JC, good results, university...<br /><br />Too many regrets to last me for a lifetime and maybe the next. And what about 'regret's a wasted emotion?'<br />I have spent too much time on unnecessary things and it is now probably too late to turn back the hands of the clock.<br /><br />Then again, will I be able to embrace happiness if I had taken an alternate route?<br />The path we never take will always be littered with surprises and uncertainties which we will never know.<br /><br />Maybe I will wake up to a different life?<br /><br />But while I am still stuck in the current, let me whine about my pathetic saving accounts that is reflecting an amount lesser than yesterday's each time I checked.<br />And I have absolutely no source of income.<br />Oh no. Not the boyfriend for I will never demand. I am not expecting him to ease my financial burden for it is and never will be his role until the status quo changes.&nbsp;<br />Friends sort of make sense when they commented about the little financial impact that few hundreds would have on him but still, no. We earn for what we need/want, yes?<br /><br />This pessimism will kill me one day and till then, I shall live a life&nbsp;in a sad blue shade, live days without sunlight and night without stars.<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Times New Roman"" size=""3""></font></p><br /><br />"

"event","<p>It was a mad rush yesterday afternoon. Class ended early at 10 and since theres a three hour break in between, I made a trip to town.<br />It was a mad rush, going from school to Plaza Singapure then to Liat towers and finally back to school again. All the travelling sapped the whatever energy that was left in me and I dozed off on the bus ride back to school, missing the stop and took a long walk back with the sun shining down my back, scalding my skin through the black tee I was in.</p><p>Everything went well and I was satisfied with my purchases of the day. The watch looks abit funny though but it was the nicest out of the four I got to choose from and beggar cant be chooser.<br />I saw a really nice black leather strap skinwatch though and hopefully by the next time I redeem the skinwatch again, it would be among the fews I could select from. :)</p><p>I LOVE shopping with (free) vouchers because it somehow comfort the guilt of spending unnecessarily.<br />I still have 5000 sunperks points left to redeem and I am already getting excited about the Zara and food vouchers I can get. :)<br />And for that, I love M1.</p><p>Oh. I will be applying for a Starhub line soon since the M1 contract has already expired and M1's charges is too high for me to afford monthly. 200bucks/month. My goodness.<br />And moreover, Starhub has free IDD calls to HongKong which means I can call boyfriend as and when I want!</p><p>Enough of digressing and back to the noon of yesterday when the day took a turn for the worse and killed all the happy cells that created on the short shopping trip I had.<br /><br /></p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""ShangHai"">The Shanghai 6month attachment might not materialise with the last minute changes and the difficulties in obtaining further details. It was very hard to get hold of the teacher in charge and when we finally get to contact her, she has only a few minutes to spare us before having to rush for meeting or classes. :(&nbsp; We rushed to the 9floor to find her and was lucky to catch her walking out with MissWong.&nbsp;<br />Max's application to Shanghai will be KIV which means he most probably will be going in the second semester of year 3 instead of the first. Jieying and I will be posted to SSIC instead of Tyco because Tyco closed one of their vacancy.<br />There are currently so many other factors to reconsider since we will not be getting any allowance from the company as we will be receving free accomodation. Apparently, the living standard in Shanghai is high and surviving there with the meagre amount of money we will be bringing along with us will be tough.<br />However, I am still quite determined to go because it is a rare opportunity and I guess the experiences and life lessons I will learn from this trip cannot be buy with any amount of money.<br />Being attached overseas as a student is more than just the company we will be attached to since no matter which company we are posted to, we will most probably be asked to do the simplest tasks (administrative work, data entry...)<br />Personally, I feel that going overseas is a challenge and if we are able to put aside our fears and walk out of our comfort zone and accept this challenge, it would elevate us above everyone else because of the courage we possess to learn to be independent.<br />Being alone overseas require independence and self discipline. When our life is thrown at us to be managed, we will start to take it more seriously and consider every decisions we have to make carefully because we will be the bearer of the consequences without anyone else to absorb them for us.&nbsp;<br />Besides, it will also help us to discover more about ourselves and widen our perspectives in life.<br /><br />We may feel sad leaving everything we have behind for six months but honestly speaking, it is only a matter of time for one day, all of us will find our spouses and begin a new chapter of life with the special one, and the people dear to us will not stay for good with the inevitable death awaiting everyone.<br />As a teenager without much responsibilities, I feel that this is the best time for us to try our something new for we still have time ahead of us and if we made any mistakes along the way, there is time to rectify them.<br />As we grow older, our responsibilities will increase and it will be harder for us to let go and do something of our interest without considerations for other factors in life.<br /><br />Frankly speaking, I would loved Jieying to go with me to Shanghai for I will definitely enjoy my six months in Shanghai with a companion.<br />But ultimately, the choice is hers.<br /><br />I am hoping for the best.<br /></div>"

"event","2007 has not been well so far with the series of unfortunate events happening. There were a few that were a blessing in disguise but not enough to balance out the bad. <br />I choose to be hopeful though and I believe that the year will get better as it goes because there can only be that much unhappiness in a year. <br /><br />I have been writing in myboyfriendissexy since 2004, about one month after I got together with YingLiang. It was started in the name of fun for blogging was just introduced then and everyone was talking about it. Moreover, I was trying to get YingLiang to get an email for convenience purposes and so we named his email mygirlfriendispretty and my blog myboyfriendissexy. <br />The blog holds many memories. There are some which will make my heart glows when I read them but there are also others which leave a bitter after taste. But life is just as it is, bringing us up high to cloud nine then letting go and allowing us to fall to the ground, experiencing pain emotionally and physically, some taking longer than others to heal. <br /><br />I would have continue writing there if not for the increasing number of unwanted visitors who judged and make unnecessary comments and when words come round, I will get upset and try to explain myself only to feel angry and stupid for these people do not even matter. <br />So I write with ambiguity and restrictions and defeat the purpose of having a blog for I cannot even pen down my thoughts freely.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thus I created amoreprezioso (precious love)&nbsp;and open it to people who matter because these are the people whom I want to share my life with. :) <br /><br />Pictures will be up soon after I uploaded them into photobucket :)<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""16 January 2007"">I have been staying over at boyfriend's place for the past few days. I am leading my life without much thoughts and wasting my time away. Just a few days ago, I had a huge fight with boyfriend and there were a list of reasons for me to walk out of the relationship. It can be so tiring being in this relationship with him being so self-centred, unappreciative and insensitive. It pains me so much when I am reminded of the ugly side of him but I always try to push it to the back of the head and live in denial so as to maintain this relationship.&nbsp;<br />I could go on and on about him if I want but at the end of the day, I will go a big round and be back at where I started because I am not ready to go through a breakup at this moment. Everyone around me, including myself knows that I will be much happier without him but sometimes, there is more to a relationship than love. After awhile, dependence will integrate itself into the bond we share and with that, it gets harder to fall out of love.<br />Love is blind, it numbs the senses and kill rationality.<br /><br />I am getting very excited about the 6months attachment to Shanghai. It is going to be an enriching trip, being in a big city, away from home with friends. I do not know how I am going to survive without my family and friends who are so dear to me but then again, that is when I will learn to be independent.<br />But before anything, I will have to study real hard and do well&nbsp;for the exams&nbsp;to make up for the screwed up projects due to uncooperative groupmate. And that is another long story for the next entry.<br /><br />So many things can happen in 6months and I am so afraid that I will drift away from people when I get back. There are so many people in life that I treasure and my greatest fear, other than losing my family and senses, is to live a life without them.<br />People like Helen, Jieying, Mong, Ray, Zhenli, Ernest, Shyam, Amanda, Teoxu, Jiajun, Xueyin, Cleo, Kweeyong...<br />And also my family whom I will always think of. I love them so much and it will be so hard living without them.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is a sales at Zara and I am going down to shop shop shop! Got quite a few things from online sprees lately and the new camera to replace the lost one. I think I'd better curb my spending before I cleared every cent in my account.<br />But a girl will always be a girl and Edna will always be Edna. I will always LOVE shopping!<br /></div><br /><br />"

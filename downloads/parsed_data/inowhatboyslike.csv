"event","ive been in the best mood lately, and i think it has to do with all the amazing friends i have in my life...and this one guy in particular...

I love how i have so many different kinds of friends. i have goofy ones, serious ones, wierd ones, emotional ones, blah ones and just plain ones. Each friend brings out something different in me, and i love it. when we are all together...its like a BIG BANG and we all just mesh so well. 

For the LONGEST time i was in the rut and i was just pissed at the world, but i always had my friends stick by me, even if i didnt stick by them like i should have. I know i was mean and prolly ignored a lot of people, and i know i lost some friends along the way. I just love though, that the ones who mean the most to me have stuck around and put up with me. It means so much. I was in this, ""ima cool kid, dont mess with me"" stage, but im SOOO over that. I just love chillin with my friends, and just watchin movies at someones house. 

Life has changed so much for all of us...i mean think about it...i'll be 18 in 7 months....can you believe that...whoever said it would be ok for me to take care of myself was one crazy fool. I still somewhat feel as if i am still a child (prolly cause my dad still treats me like one) but i know im not. I am truly thankful that i have a mother like i do, she sees that i am growing up and she is letting me have my space and do more of what i want. She knows how independent i am and is trying to let go. part of me wants to be let go, but then another part of me doesnt. but its life, thats what we all have to do. 

I was talking to one of my church leaders, and she was talking about how she got married at 20...TWENTY...crazy...thats 2 and a half years...i could be married in 2 like 2 years...how insane is that. I mean...wow...its like an appifany to me. I donno. Im so excited to grow up and i just hope that i dont mess up anymore cause i have in the past. I wouldnt chang e those mess ups for the world, cause i learned from them. 

I thank GOD everyday for the wonderful friends and family He has blessed me with and i hope you all know how much you mean to me, even if i dont say it. 

This life is not a job, its a precious gift and we should all take advantage of it.  

on another note...bought a stupid $90 bathing siut from Swim n Sprot...wow was that stupid so i went to go take it back today and they wouldnt take it but i needed the money for my insurence this month so i talked to teh manager and totally talked my way into getting my money back...so i was proud of myself. i know lame right, but i was, cause im the girl who always calls her mom so she can get her way...this time i got my way by myself. you should be proud of me. 

went to see the longest yard with a friend last night...saw ashlee and lauren and emma, jason and some other people and totally tripped walking UP the steps...oh well...hehe 

i hope everyone is doing ok. 

gotta take the SAT on saturday...yay that'll be loads of fun...NOT..im taking it at mill creek...is anyone else? 

hope to hang out iwth all of you this summer!

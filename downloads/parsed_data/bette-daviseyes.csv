"event","It is popcorn o'clock!  It has come to my recent attention that the phrase that I started using with my cubies at work is applicable in almost any office setting.  Specifically cube farms, as they tend to house more popcorn-burners per square inch.  Let me explain the phenomenon...

Popcorn o'clock: The time of day (in my office it is around 2:45 PM) when the people (I'm not pointing fingers, but it is usually the rounder old ladies) start making and burning the microwave popcorn.  You can almost set your watch by it...halfway between the end of lunch and the end of the workday.  The popcorn burners are loyal fans, they never stray.  It doesn't matter if you have an office birthday and everyone has cake at 1:00.  Oh no, they need it.  They crave it.  They just gotta have it.  And they usually flaunt it after they've made it...strolling around, saying it is 'just a little something to get them through the rest of the day,' offering their burnt kernals to unsuspecting victims who are then tormented by the lingering stench.  In my book, popcorn burners are right up there with non-toilet flushers.  The world could do with a few less.

So tomorrow, I challenge you to take notice of what time your popcorn o'clock occurs.  It is there, oh yes, it is there.  And when you find it, let it comfort you that there is some consistency in this world.  Stinky, but consistent."

"event","Not only was this the title of the beginning of the end of The Sopranos, but it also the reason I joined Live Journal.  My sister decided to make her journal 'friends only,' and until an hour ago I didn't have an account, so I would have been prevented from reading the trials and tribulations of Jen...and I just couldn't let that happen, as reading Jen's journal is part of my morning ritual.  Coffee + Jen's blog = beginnings of a good day.  So I'm back in the loop!

I avidly post blogs on myspace, so we'll see if I can keep up with both without going blog crazy."

"event","Well, I've taken the plunge and started a journal dedicated to the endless quest for a healthier weight.  Tomorrow sees the start of a new year, and hopefully will be the catalyst I need to actually find a diet and fitness programme that works for me and that I can actually stick at for more than a few months!

I'm sick of this yo-yo lifestyle I have at the minute, so the plan this time is slow and steady.  I have to be careful with exercise because of my Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but at the same time carrying extra weight affects the illness as well, so it's a matter of striking the right balance.

So this will be the place where I come to do my moaning, keep all that out of my main journal.  It's great to have your support!

Tomorrow I shall be doing all my weighing and measuring, so I'll know where I'm starting from then.  Wish me luck!"

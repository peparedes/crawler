I went to barrett and had an ok time but boy does Swimming around in a float tube kill. we didn't catch much, and my dad was real shicked about that one. Becasue he has always told me if you can't catch a fish at a lake go to barrett and you will catch at least one gaurenteed!! well, he was right i caught a fish.... but it wasn't a bass. I was bummed. :o( but the one I caught was  huge  for a bluegill. it was about 1 to 2 pounds more on the 2 side and for those fish that is pretty good! I guess.. :Op but anyways then i came home and went straight to MT. Helix and was crewing till 11 then came home. Sunday I worked from 9-3 sooo easy!!! then had my friend ashley pick me up at work because my truck was getting an exhaust on it... which by the way i'm sooo excited!!! :o) I didn't get a loud on though because it's only a ford Ranger and would sound wierd with that much power in the exhaust. Then spent the night at her friends house and hung out. Today I have Crewing again but this time we meet at 6:00 instead of 5:30 which is better. gotta go, gotta get ready...

I know Melissa Is gone but it doesn't feel like it, but i know once school starts it's going to be horriable. Everyone is going to be crying on the first day back. I don't know if i can take it when we go back. This saturday is the services at 10 Am and I'm going with two of my other friends. It's going to be a hard day for alot of people. I'm scared!! I'm gonna miss not seeing Melissa's beautyful smile and her great personality but life has to go on, we can't live in the past.

But I heard some terriable news that Milissa Sijtar Is now no longer with us because she got into a horriable jet ski accident and lost her life. Everyone is a total mess. The first day back is going to be horriable, I already know! There should be a funnerl soon, so I will defentily be going to that. I'm so sad, it's going to be different at school our senior year. You always think your senior is going to be differnet well it's going to be for the El Cap of 05'.

"event","Hey all today has been an awsome day!! i went to San Vicente with Chess and I got fried!!! But it was fun, I also did some knee boarding, which I haven't done since I was 7 and I was not use to it. But i did it and almost got to the point of doing a spin it was cool. I told Chess how to get one down and she did it after her 2nd time. The n we headed back and went to Albertsons and got food.:o) And got alot of attention with my burt thighs but white legs lol. Now were just chillin' at her house.. so i better go I'll write later.

"event","Today, has been a bad day for me and all I can tell you is it's because My grandma ran into my Truck and messed it up and I heard some interesting information and now I know that Some people arn't what they really seem. So True! But now I get to countdown to the time I get to go to work at 5 and work till 10 oh boy I can't wait. But anyways like my new journal it's so cool. Hope you all like it and get a view from my side. write comments if you like. Talk later

"event","I got my results a few days ago I wasn't too happy with them because I know i'm capable of gettin betta ones  I got:  1A  for french: 5  Bs  which were for double science grrrr, maths, eng lit and home economices. I also got 3Cs which were for eng lang, ict and geography. C was the highest grade I could get for both english language and geography because I took foundation. Similarly B was the highest I could get in maths because of the paper I took. I think I will get my papers back and then probably re-take the sciences because I know I can do betta. I'm so frustrated with myself more than anything I'm disappointed in myself too!!!!!!"

"event","gahh im in one of thoose moods feelin sorry for myself i hate it when i feel like this it gets on my wicket n other peoples for that matter! Guys n me never work out which sucks i mean i have mates who are guys which is great coz they give good advice and things but me n relationships r doomed from the moment they start or sum times even before that lol! Well ill say 1 thing at least i can laugh about it coz laughter is a good remedy to have! Wish i could meet a guy who wants to b more than firends dnt get me wrong guys who r my friends are cool but u kno theres always a part of me that wants more than that. All my mates who are guys i am content with bein a guy because i either kno them too well or nt realli that well and theres other issues as well. Meetin a guy for a first time is special its fun to get to kno them in a way i think it makes the relationship stronger but thats just my view on it lol. Gahh i have to stop moaning n b thankful 4 wot ive gt i have to think of thoose poor kids in Africa who would give ne thing to have at least half of wot i do! Hellp MAKE POVERTY HISTORY GIVE TO CHARITY! SPARE A THOUGHT FOR INNOCENT KIDS IN AFRICA WHO ARE NEEDLESSLY DIEING!  right betta go now ill up date this journal thing again soon when i have sum interesten feelings r mood lol"

"event","lol well theres lots i could write on this journal thing but i wouldnt kno where or how to begin so here goes. Yesterday was my prom wish i could say it were my leaving prom but i still have two more years at my school yawns although for sum of my mates it was their leaver ball as the r moving on to betta things. They all had a gd time n most of them were pissed as they r probably neva gonna c the teachers eva again so they didnt mind getin pissed in front of them! where as for me i still have to face the teachers in september so thought it betta nt to drink. But just coz sum 1 is sober it don't mean that they can't have fun i've found on sum occasions when i've been sober for 1 reason or another it is often funni because u can remaind all ur piss head mates the nxt day wot they did/ said. All good storys for when the individual gets married all the best storys are often drunken ones!"

"event","In the midst of all this really hot weather, I had a dream last night that it snowed. I felt a little disappointed when I woke up, lol. As some of you may know if you remember some of my past comments and entries (some here and on Twitter), I'm not exactly a huge fan of the summer season. I've lived in the deep south all my life, so of course I'm used to the heat in late spring/summer. It's nothing new to me. But being used to it and enjoying it are really two different things.  Of course, summer offers a few things I like, such as watching the fireflies (or ""lightning bugs"" as we call them here), or seeing the fireworks on the 4th of July. I guess I can find some good things from every season, but my favorite remains and probably always will be Fall."

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep
The angels keep their watch
Of wandering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the Holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth!

"event","I was going to post one song per day, and post #1 on Christmas, but I didn't have time to finish, so I'm posting the entire rest of the list today. 

So here's my top favorite Christmas songs ever. To me, these are the essentials. Christmas hasn't fully begun until I've listened to these songs each year...

<b>#5: It Came Upon A Midnight Clear</b>
<lj-embed id=""39""/>

I think this is one of the most beautiful traditional carols ever written. It's moving and peaceful, and just makes me want to just stop everything and close my eyes.

-----

<b>#4: I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day</b>
<lj-embed id=""40""/>

The lyrics to this song are just so powerful to me, and this is my favorite version.


-----

<lj-cut text=""#1-3"">
<b>#3: Christmas Don't Be Late (The Chipmunk Song)</b>
<lj-embed id=""41""/>

<i>We've been good, but we can't last. Hurry Christmas, hurry fast!</i> That lyric is just what I feel about Christmas each year. All year long I wait in anticipation of my favorite time of year. This song brings such a smile to my face, and I sing along out loud every time I hear it!


<b>#2: Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy by Bing Crosby and David Bowie</b>
<lj-embed id=""42""/>

<i>Peace on earth...can it be?</i>  That is my wish too.


------

Now I was going to have 5 songs in this post, but frankly there was just no way I could choose between my 2 favorite Christmas songs on earth. So, these 2 songs are tied for #1.

<b>#1: ""O HOLY NIGHT"" AND ""WHITE CHRISTMAS"" BY BING CROSBY</b>

I am convinced that ""O Holy Night"" is the single most beautiful Christmas carol ever written (by multiple artists, but I just picked one random here). It's even one of those most beautiful songs ever written PERIOD. The words of this song for me have a power that no other song can compare to for me personally. Songs don't usually make me cry, but this song has. 

Fun little trivia fact: this is the first known song to ever broadcast over the radio.
<lj-embed id=""43""/>

------
Christmas Day 2010. I'm looking out my window as the snow falls softly outside as this song plays in the background. I've seen snow before, but never like this. Never on Christmas. This was my very first white Christmas. Something that - due to my location in Atlanta, Georgia - may be a once in a lifetime thing for me. I'd waited all my life to get a white Christmas, and I will forever remember that moment when I got to experience it, and that song played.
<lj-embed id=""44""/> 

</lj-cut>

Runners up include: 
- ""Christmas Canon"" by Trans-Siberian Orchestra
- The First Noel
- Silent Night

I hope everyone had/has a wonderful, blessed Christmas and holiday season."

And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were so afraid. And the angel said unto them, 'fear not, for behold, I bring to you tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you: you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

Sort of amazing - at least to me - a color film 90 years old. This wasn't originally filmed in black and white then recolored later. No. This is one of the earliest films that was filmed directly in color when it was first made. 

What lead me to this was an article on Yahoo that talked about this year's additions to the National Film Registry in the Library of Congress. Other movies included were ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""A League of Their Own"", ""Dirty Harry"", and ""A Christmas Story""."

I remember first hearing this song off the movie Home Alone (which first came out when I was really little).

I held onto that cassette for years. I don't know if I still have it now or not.

<lj-embed id=""31""/>

<b>Why I love this song:</b> I associate this song with happy memories of going to my grandma's house on Christmas Eve night for dinner, and my grandpa or one of my uncles would take me and my cousins outside and have us look for ""Rudolph"" flying in the sky. He'd pick out an airplane flying across the sky and tell us it was really Rudolph. Our family (especially all the kids) would also sing the fun version of the song where you'd go ""like a lightbulb!"", ""like Monopoly!"", etc, at certain points in the song. Those were the days. I had good times as a kid. :)

I'll compile a list first, gather my thoughts, and start the countdown sometime in the upcoming days. 

As you may or may not know, the Christmas season is my absolute favorite time of year and I revel in it. I get extremely into the holiday spirit. My house is all decked out with the tree and the lights on the outside and snowglobes and candles and everything else, and I'm even wearing a Santa tshirt right now! I play Christmas music excessively and I sing along, and I watch the Christmas movies and holiday specials and everything else. I take the time to send a personalized Christmas card to each of my family and friends through snail mail, the old fashioned way. I love attending the Christmas Eve service at church with my family. All of this. I can't get enough! 

I think some people may find me annoying about my obsession with Christmas, but hey, I don't mind being a dork about it. If it's something I can get into, why not! It lifts my spirits and makes me smile. :)"

I'm absolutely in love with this show. Supernatural has strong competition right now. Supernatural is still my #1, but just barely so. I may have to consider The Walking dead tied with Supernatural as my #1 show pretty soon.

They've hit the jackpot with the Walking Dead, bringing in a record 10.9 million viewers last night. They STILL managed to increase their audience, even with the loss of Dish Network. That's pretty damn impressive."

I never thought I'd get to the point where I'd be more excited about the upcoming return of The Walking Dead than I am Supernatural. I'm still a fan of the show, but I just don't get the same feeling from it anymore. But nonetheless, I'm still watching tonight, and I'll try to give my thoughts on it later, maybe.

I feel like one of the only Supernatural fans in existence that just doesn't really give a crap about Castiel. Everyone loves him, but I'm in the unpopular ""not a fan of Cas"" category. Dean has been, is now, and probably always will be my favorite person on the show (sorry, Sam), and Sam comes 2nd.

For some reason it's like this month has conspired against me and I find myself injury prone lately. Since this month started, I have gotten bug bites, the cat's scratched me, I've stubbed my toe, I've bruised my leg from climbing in the window (when I accidently locked myself out of the house like an idiot one morning), I've cut my finger, I've cut my lip, I've banged my shoulder in the doorway getting up in the middle of the night; I've had something fall off a store shelf on top of my foot.  Yea I'm done with this month."

"event","What a great miniseries! It's too bad it was only 3 parts long. It's easily one of the best things I've seen on television in a long time. I was glued to the tv and sitting on the edge of my seat at several points. I'll definitely be picking this up on DVD to add to my collection. I've known about the Hatfield and McCoy feud - it's just well known part of American history - but this show prompted me to dig deeper and research the details of the history of it.

Who else watched, and what did you think?"

Mothers have to put up with a lot! I know I was definitely a handful for my mother when I was a kid. I know I drove her crazy at times. It takes a lot of strength and patience to be a mom (it takes a lot of patience working with kids that aren't my own, so I imagine it'd take so much more for a mom). I admire my mom so much, and I think I learn to appreciate what she's done for me more and more as I grow older.

I'd really like to be a mom one day."

"event","According to Twitter, it looks like <i>Supernatural</i> got picked up for season 8. They're running longer than <i>Buffy</i> now. 

Honestly, I have mixed feelings about it.

On one hand, I'm wary that the show is being stretched out too long and the quality will suffer (well some of it already HAS suffered, in my opinion, but I still love my show). On the other hand, it's a habit to watch <i>Supernatural</i> every week, and I have an attachment to it. I'll miss it if it's gone. 

I'm not the type of person who REALLY gets invested in a lot of tv shows at once. I just pick one or two things at a time and stick with it for years, like I did for <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> (and <i>Angel</i>). And it was TOUGH losing <i>Buffy</i>. I bawled like a baby during the series finale. When the time comes for Supernatural to end, I know I'll bawl like a baby again, possibly even worse."

"event","Ever since I was a little girl, I've always been fascinated with Titanic, from the very first time I heard about it. I grew up reading stories and looking at books having to do with the Titanic, and the stories behind it. And there's a LOT of stories: everything from paranormal tales surrounding the ship, to a kidnapping case (which is true). I think it's the one historical event that I've researched/read about the most.

What's sad is that this disaster could have been avoided (as when Titanic got one ice warning, they reportedly replied, ""Shut up! I'm busy!"")

One more interesting bit of info: In today's money, here's what it would have cost to book passage on The Titanic:
1st class regular room - About $3,000
1st class parlor suite - About $80,000
2nd class - About $1,200
3rd class - About $300 to $800
(I rounded on some of those - <a href=""http://www.keyflux.com/titanic/facts.htm"">source</a>)"

"event","I was reading about how the last Titanic survivor died in 2009, and I got to thinking about the oldest people in the world. I found some interesting stats:

Out of almost 7 billion people on earth, there are only 28 verified people left alive that were born in the 1800s. Out of those, 27 are female, and 1 male. There are only 69 verified people who are at least 110 years old. Out of those, 64 are female, and 5 are male. 

The oldest (verified) person to have ever lived was a woman named Jeanne Calment, who was born in 1875, and died in 1997 at the age of 122.

(got this off Wikipedia)

I couldn't imagine what it would be like to live to be 122 years old. Also interesting that most of the oldest people in the world are women. I wonder why so few men have made it to that age."

"event","I hope everyone had a lovely Easter. My Easter was nice, and it was a beautiful day! It started off in the 40s this morning (which was a nice break because it's been hot lately), then warmed up to a pleasant sunny day in the 70s. I started off the day at church and I worked in the sunday school and it was busy. We had twice as many kids as normal. Then our church had an easter egg hunt afterwards. After that I had to rush home and get my dessert ready (cookies). Then we had our annual family Easter gathering, and I got to see some people I haven't seen in months. And I ate WAY too much. There's always so much wonderful homemade food at my family's gatherings. It was like Thanksgiving all over again (there was even turkey, ham, dressing and cranberry sauce). There was also homemade lasagna, creamed corn, baked beans, broccoli casserole, fresh fruit (a mix of grapes, strawberries, and honeydew melon), my aunt's red velvet cake, brownies, and banana pudding. I feel like I don't need to eat again until Thanksgiving lol."

"event","On the way home today, I was wondering why my music sounded so tinny. I was sure the bass was all the way up. I don't have subs, but I still expected more with my Eclipse speakers. I checked the level, and it said 7 (it ranges from 7 to -7) I then realized that it said -7. So half the way home my car was thumpin."

"event","Got some White Castle for dinner.

My mom and I went to Castleton tonight to get new dress slacks for me. We also stopped at Guitar Center. I played on some of the expensive basses. One of my favorites was a 1976 Rickenbacker, but it was $1999. I did get a new cord and uber cool strap."

"event","School went by pretty quickly today.

We got two tests back in English. I got a 90 on my Puritan Lit test and a 91 on my Crucible test. Speaking of tests, we have one in AP USH Wednesday. I have to do two presidential outlines, a chart, workbook, and the outlines, but all that won't take too long. I should get like 75% of it done tonight.

Unless I have to cut the grass. My dad will want me to, but I don't want to. I have to get this stuff done soon, and tonight is way better than tomorrow night.

Especially since we have NHS Induction Practice at freaking 6:50 in the morning. Why did I sign up for this? Whoever chooses the times for these meetings must live in Fortville. I also like the organization (or lack thereof). A meeting was announced today, but we were told it was for old members, but it was for everyone. Also, the people who did go didn't have a room to meet in. Plus, in the past week or so, I've heard like 3 different dates for the induction. It is obvious that NHS doesn't encourage organization :)

Must do homework. Gag."

"event","I did AP USH almost all day today. Blah.

Friday night was a football game. We lost. Goodbye perfect record. 5-1 now. Shelbyville killed us 2 years ago at our homecoming, and they kill our record this year. Stupid Golden Bears.

Saturday was the Greenwood Invitational. We got 3rd of 4. We got a 54.something which is good enough to get past district, assuming we don't get worse between now and then.

I heard that I was supposed to get a letter because I was accepted into NHS. We hadn't gotten it, so I was going to ask tomorrow why I didn't. Turns out we did get it. I guess on one night when I was doing something after school and I couldn't get the mail, my dad got it and just threw it all in a pile of junk mail, so I get it like 3 weeks later. Thanks."

"event","School was kinda boring. I got a 100 on my Pre-Cal test. Go me.

We have a football game tonight (against Shelbyville). Fun stuff. Also, tomorrow we have an marching band invitational. I'm staying to see all of the bands.

My plain black Fender strap broke last night, so I brought in my Pinto/cow pattern strap. I tied it around my head like a bandana and I was the Bovine Ninja.

Well, I'm gonna go downstairs, eat dinner, and get ready to go to the game."

I want a Kenworth W900. Those things are amazing. Feel free to get me one.

Speaking of 18 wheelers, I've seen a nice red Freightliner over at the Griffith's. I almost stopped to get out and look at it, but I would feel kinda stupid. It's nice though."

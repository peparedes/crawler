"event","So the last few days...phew...crazy!

Got a second roomie yesterday...his name is Tom...yes, that SHOULD cause some confusion in the near future...anyway, he moved in, and had to give him my house key till we get another made (this will be relevant soon)

So after work today, I leave, and Nate is still out front waiting for his ride. I offer to give him a ride to Citrus County, but he told me he has his friends and gf on the way up...but in the mean time, we went to Denny's with Abu to have some food til they get there. His friends were hilarious...and yeah, it was a good time at the ole Villages Denny's.

So I get home, and its about 12:30 in the morn and I realize...FUCK TOM HAS MY KEY! So I call him, and of course, he doesn't pick up because...well, again its 12:30am. So Mission Impossible Style, I extract my screen from my windows, and jimmy the window open, raise the blinds, and proceed to climb on in...however, in the process, I spilled a big gulp sized cup of water that was on my window sil ALL OVER THE FUCKING BED!

Which is the sole reason that I am posting on LiveJournal at 1:24am after a 13 hour day at work!

I should have went out and drank in honor of Cinco De Mayo...at least then the spilled water could be attributed to drunkness.

Here is how it works!

1. Leave me a comment that says 'interview me'.
2. I will respond with five questions.
3. You will update your journal with this explanatation.
4. You will answer the questions and post them in your update.
5. When someone says 'interview me', you will ask them five questions. 



And Kelsie asked....


1. Have you ever had your wisdom teeth out?
no, and that is good, id look like the stay puffed marshmellow man if i did, my cheeks are fat as it is!

2. When, most recently, did you want to say something and stopped yourself?
the other day, when talking to my ex, she is making the same mistakes with her new bf that she did with me, but im gonna let her live and learn

3. Would you eat Vegetable Chicken baby food if you could only eat soft foods?
Don't ask me a question to justify your only food option right now ;-)

4. If you could have three superhero powers, what would they be, and why?

id want to fly, id want to be seen by no one, and id want a swwwweeeet ride like the bat mobile. flying because, well, all the ladies would want me then ;-) invisible, so if i crashed becasue i suddently found out i didnt know how to fly, no one would see me, and a pimp bat mobile ride because, well, flying isnt for me.

5. What is your biggest pet peeve?
biggest pet peave is people that use incorrect grammar, and act urban when they arent."

Why you may ask is Ocala Nissan corresponding with me via the United States Postal Service? Well, I bought a car from them. 

A 2005 Nissan Altima 2.5s to be precise. It is black, and beautiful!

Did it a few weeks ago. I guess if I updated more, you all would know that anyway. But yea, bought a car, and they sent me nuts. Kind of a nice gesture, cept for the fact that they arrived in the mail the same day as my first $445 car payment.

So yeah today, I was going to my mom's for dinner...and I drove my car
through a puddle in the pouring rain. For those of you who dont know
me, I drive a 98 Honda Civic, that is lowered 2.5"" and has a Cold Air
Intake that is pretty close to the ground. Well yeah, the intake sucked
some water into the engine, and it stalled RIGHT there in the rain. I
got SOAKED pushing it into a parking spot, and then, instead of
enjoying a nice night with my family, I had to rummage through a tool
collection at my mom's to find a rachet and socket that would allow me
to take the spark plugs out. By a slight chance of luck, she just so
had the EXACT tools i need so I could get all the water out of the
cylinders in the car to prevent it from hydrolocking. I got the car
running, and came home, only to find out that the AC is broken, and the
house is at a steamy 86 degrees. I HATE MY LIFE!<br> <br> DAMNIT MAN!<br> <br> Out,<br> Thomas"

"event","It has been a little bit since I have updated, so I will try to recap, yet keep it short, because I have somewhere to be shortly.

I still have not moved all my stuff from my apartment, but that will be done this Thursday.

Work has been very busy, and my camera sales people are tearing things up. I feel that the contest will be ours before long! (We are competeting with the rest of the stores in my district for a 250 dollar team get together...I will keep you posted.)

I played golf for the first time yesterday. Went to the driving range with Tim Scott. It was freaking awesome! I think that next month, when I get paid I am going to buy some clubs and try to go once a week. I was killing the ball off the tee in comparison to what I USED to do. I was hitting tee shots between 175-225 all day long. It was awesome. Good to get out and be active. 

Have been hanging out with some people lately that I have been meaning to see, but I never seemed to have the time. Jill Bandhauer and Lindsey Dunn came up and stayed the other night. That was fun...we went to Bennigan's with Josh, Fred, and Mark from Circuit Ciy. Mark's last was that night, so it was kind iof a send off for him also.

I went to an Intel trainiing in Tampa with Vinny and James. It was awesome. We represented Ocala hard core. Vinny won a $600 mother board and processor set. Big ups to the Italian Stallion. After the training we got to see Star Wars Episodde 3.

My suggestion...SEE IT NOW! STOP READING THIS AND GO SEE IT!

The effects were breath taking.

I hung out with Hollie the other night, whom I hadn't seen for ages. That was a blast, and hopefully we can do it again soon.

That brings me to today...

Lizabeth is coming by later, We FINALLY got to hang out last night. She is an AMAZING PERSON! I have alot in common with her. Today should be tons of fun. Nothing by laying around and watching movies. God I am SO lazy.

So I have lived at Fred's less than a week, and well, there have been two motorcycle crashes in less than a week involving his friends.

Weird eh?

A few days ago, Walid crashed on a closed course in Jennings, Florida.

So I get home today tonight and Fred, Robin, Chip and a friend of theres whos name I did NOT catch were out riding.

I was just minding my own business, layed out watching October Sky (great movie by the way) and I hear a bike pull up. 

I was like ""Hmmm they only left a few minutes ago, whats up?""

So Robin comes inside after riding Fred's bike home and tells me that Chip wrecked.

I got dressed went and helped Fred load Chip's bike up, then I came home.

Am I a bad omen?

(Long story, I will tell it another time, do trust!)

I met up with the lovely Amelia at the local Wal-Mart to buy some Ben & Jerry's to accompany our watching of Will and Grace. However that quickly turned into an amatuer pool tournament.

Little did I know that Aimee was quite the pool shark. After jumping out to an incredible 1-0 lead in our mini tournament, I made a furious comeback to win the first annual Aimee & Thomas Tournament of Champions 2-1. 

I ROCK!

But Aimee kept getting better as the night went on. I will have to try even harder as we are sure to have many more tournaments over this summer.

In all seriousness. Aimee is a fantastic person. I am very lucky to know her. I always feel so uplifted after talking to her. I wish I got to see her more often, but hopefully we will get to hang out alot this summer....YOU TAKIN NOTES AIMEE??? ;-)....and oh yes, she makes my loins moist and warm! 

GET THOSE PERVERTED THOUGHTS OUT OF YOUR HEAD KIDDIES....I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH THAT WOMAN!

Ha, that is enough of that before I piss someone off and embarass them.

Yes, I took the advice of one <lj user=""mme_le_slip""> and made Mr. Ron Rico somehow share a glass with Mr. Coca Cola and they now live in perfect harmony in my stomach...and soon my liver, before being flushed down the toilet, only to spend an eternity together in the water purification center in Ocala.

Ah...it was a splendid night.

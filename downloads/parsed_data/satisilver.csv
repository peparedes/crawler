"event","I know I have not written a lot lately, and please do not take it as I do not think of you guys, it is just that there has been a lot going on in my life lately.  Sadly, more bad than good.  Before I write all of this, i want to make it very clear that i am not digging for sympathy (like some others journals) but I think it will help me sort out what is going on in my life, and maybe get some advice from others around me, to figure out how the hell I am suppose to handle this.  Having said that....
The Saturday before Turkey Day, I flew into Tennessee to see my family.  Not only was this going to be a holiday, but I also had not spilled the ""great"" news about me expecting yet.  Basically, none of them knew.  So, I had been off the plane for about 30 minutes when we stopped to get something to eat.  It was while we were here that I decided that I would tell the people who had picked me up.  I was just so excited, I could not wait any longer!  My mother happened to be one of these people.  As soon as I told them, the first thing my mother said was ""Well, it cannot call me grandma!""  And without going into very much detail about my relationship with my mother (which sucks!) I had pretty much expected this reaction from her.  Though expecting it and actually getting it are two totally different things.  So, needless to say, I was crushed.  More than that, I felt like my heart had been removed from my chest and stepped on!  But my aunt was there and my sister, and they seemed really happy for me.  But, as much as I was hurt, I was pissed.  Any of you that know me know I am a fisty little thing and when I am pissed off about something, I am pissed off!!!  So, oddly enough, the lights in the restuarant we were eating in went out about 1 minute after I shared what was to me the most excited news of my life.  I looked outside and oddly enough, the entire block was also out!  Though this was probably just a complete coincidence, it was very humorous.  My mother got up from the table (we had just gotten our food) did not finish eating and went to the bathroom.  She did not return until we were all ready to go, nor did she say one word to me on the car ride back, which was about an hour long.  It was two days later before I seen my mother again.  And remember, I have not been home to see them in about 2 1/2 years.  You would think my mother would want to see me.  Then when I finally saw her, a couple hours after she showed up at my grandma's she ended up cussing my sister out for something she said we did when we were in highschool.  Then she got in her car and left.  But I found out later that she pulled my aunt aside and told her not to tell anyone that they work with about this, because me being pregnant was not something to celebrate.  I did not see her for the rest of that day.  So, now my sister is absolutely in tears and I cannot say anything to her, because I have been crying off and on all week too because of how she acted to me.  So the next day, as if someone has flipped a switch, my mother wants to be my best friend.  My grandma wanted all the grand kids to go get their pictures made together since we had not all been together in a long while.  And while we were at Wal-Mart waiting she wanted to play with my hair and pat my head and touch me and I was totally still pissed at her.  I could understand if it was just a bad reaction and she had apoligized for it, but this is how my mother is.  She does something or says something that nobody in the world should have to see or hear and then a couple of hours or days later wants to act like she did nothing and is sorry for nothing.  And, though it may be that she treated me this was the whole time I was growing up, I know how hard that was on me, and I WILL NOT allow her to treat my kids that way!  I mean, if I cannot stand up for the little tike when its not even arrived yet, how will I be able to stand up for it when it needs me most.  So, I have to live by my morals, not by how my family ""has always done things"".  So, my mother started petting and shit and I flat out told her ""Dont touch me.""  I did not yell it, I just said it even tone.  There is no way she could not have known I was serious.  That evening, she came in with all these bags of stuff that she had bought for the baby.  Why she wants to buy stuff for him/her now just doesnt make sense.  I took it, though, cause I thought ""Screw her, I will take her money.""  But then I realized.  She doesnt think she has to apoligize to me.  She thinks if I take the stuff she bought then all is even.  So, I did not bring it.  I left it there with a note that said I did not want her to buy me things.  That if she cannot be happy for me, then I do not want anything from her.  And I left it for her.  Alot of family problems have also come out of my visit.  Sometimes I think I should just not have told them.  If I have another child, I am not telling my family minus a few who were actually happy for me.  So now there are people in my family who are mad that other people did not say something to her, that they just let her say what ever she wanted and make me and my sister miserable while we were there.    And, in the process of trying to keep the peace, some people just tried to brush it under a rug and act like it never happened.  This, in my mind, was them inadvertantly taking my mothers side, which hurt even more.  I figured if I was so important to them that they would not stand around and let her be so mean to me and my unborn child!  So, I think that covers everything.  Though it just seems like I am being a hard ass, it is the life I have had with her and the underlying insult I felt from the whole experience.  She was quite verbal the entire time I was growing up about the fact that her kids ruined her life.  Now all this is just another slap in the face for my existence."

"event","Man if I did not notice pregnancy hormones before, I surely did today! Crazy hormones today!  Everyone on this earth that happens to have been born a male and even slightly attractive I have wanted to jump their bones.  Dreamed of sex all night and woke up feeling ""froggy"".  Started with waking my hubby up and have been INSANE all day.  At least this should even out that whole morning, noon, and night sickness!"

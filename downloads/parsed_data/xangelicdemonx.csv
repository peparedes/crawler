"event","Well, now it's passed midterm season and I'm feeling a little lazy. Considering the amount of work I have to do in the next past month, I know it's probably a good idea to start now, but for some reason I just dont feel up to it.

Umm, I'm still single. Jade and I got back together for a couple weeks but I just decided to finish it. It wasn't cool, doing the yo-yo thing.. up and down and up and down... It was mostly frustrating.

Life's okay.. lots of school work all the time. I try to get out a little and have some fun so I can balance the entire thing off, which is okay. 

I don't hang about the Gauntlet that much anymore, but I am writing a couple things. I've heard I am not really wanted around. I don't really care, people who are petty and spread rumours or say shit about people behind their back aren't cool, so I don't do the same to them. I just live with it and don't think about it too much, or else it's just dumb.

In any case, speaking of dumb, I was seeing this guy named Max for a while. The guy never called. K, I understand if someone is busy and shit, but he was always busy. I haven't heard from him in a while. I've actually given up calling him because I can't take it anymore.

Anyway, too much to talk about, i'm freaking bored."

"event","School starts in less than a month. I'm jobless, single and stressed. My life has changed a bit, but I am pretty much the same except I have changed a couple things. I'm not on nexopia anymore.. it's not because I have cut myself from it through means of just .... stopping.. hahah, but rather that I got my accoutn frozen because I was arguing with Jade about nexopia.

Well, not only because of that.. but that was a factor, and I couldn't believe that it had happened. Seriously, him,..... out of ALLL people I know.. It's just odd to think that he was able to talk to me about it for the period of time that we did.

In any case, I'm not horribly worried about that. Life's been weird lately, but it usually is and soon i'll hit a good ridge. I'm just stressed; no money no job.. It's tough knowing I have so many financial crutches that will arrive shortly and no way to satiate them.. the few hundred bucks in account cant even purchase me books.

I'll have to admit; I am sure excited to go back to the university life. I have a lot of friends there and I like the (almost) drama-less environment. Sometimes it gets icky, but that's only depending on if you make it like that. Sometimes, I dont really always like it.. The gauntlet can piss me off, the office space can get real annoying sometimes because you spend so much time with those people (editors and volunteers and other staff) and it gets a little icked out, so I have to admit the almost 4 months away from them was a sigh of relief although I do miss it a lot."

"event","Interesting things happen with time, eh. We know that from this journal, what a clear example of changes I've encountered during hte past 3 years.

Let's just start things with this sentence: Love cannot conquer all.

Jade and I have been very good, minus the one thing that was missing in our relationship. Unlike the old days, (ha) where we talked about EVERYTHING... suddenly he didn't tell me everything he thought. At one point, however, he did tell me that he was bored of our relationship. Soon, after a bit of thought (and to my fear of being broken up with) he tells me he's decided to stay with me. And that he loves me. And that he will be here for me.

Okay.

as much as that was comfort food in the middle of my buffet, it seemed as though (almost a week later) he changed his mind. Again.

On the day after canada day, he broke up with me. Okay, so that SUCKED. Like, hxc. I got really really upset, told him I didn't agree. Maybe it was because he had pulled such a cheap blind shot that I hadn't expected it. A day later, we were back together. Of coures, I was still angry. But you have to understand that love can do that sometimes.

Everything was going alright. Get this though: when he broke up with me.. he told me he was NOT joining the army. I thought that was crazy, he seemed so happy and excited for it.. And then he told me he was moving into Calgayr and joining a trade.

hmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......................

After the break up, we had a day apart. He said he thought about it all night after it happened, and I practically told him I would fight tooth and nail to be with him. He means that much to me, and I simply could not let it slide liek that. He said I had a few things to change about myself, and it wasn't for him.. but just for me. I can agree with the things he said, to an extent.. But you cannt change everything. I thought our differences complimented each other.

But then, all of a sudden, he changed his mind again. Nope, not the trades anymore--not even Canada. He wants to travelt he world, he wants to leave. Okay?? Jo's pretty confused at this point, I tell you. What to do.. leave? go with him? would that be bad? Should I go to school.. should I not? Where would he go, when would he leave.. So many questions bothered me so badly.

We talked about it, and I told him I want him to be hapy and see the world. Go. 

Today, we were talking. And now, this time, I knew what was coming. We both came to an agreement, pretty much. Unanimous. However difficult, unanimous. 

I'm still in love with him. But this is a different thing than Kyle (refer to the first part of my journal if you want details on THAT saga.) As much as I love him, I believe this is one of those things where I can learn from this.. and maybe one day the timing will be right for Jade and I. If not, live and let die. He means alot to me, but I need him to be himself.. not the person he's been lately. His indecisiveness, he says, is due to him trying to fit in with me. I never demanded that, and I find it ironic how he would tell me not to change myself for him.. yet he sorta did it (however in a different fashion) himself. 

It's okay. I'm okay. I feel like a bird with a broken wing, I'm still here.. still okay.. but I simply cannot fly. 

I love him, i want him to be happy because I care."

"event","Well, so much has happened. Not really in the fact that I've totally had life-altering things happen, but relaly that it's just been so much work and stuff to get to the end of the year at school. But I'm finally done. That's it.

Chemistry went alright. actually I lied, it was absolutely horrible and I wish everyone failed so they will curve the grade. It was so bad; I seriously got anally raped. (heh, such a bad metaphore, but soooo true).

Bio went fucking AWESOME. Seriously, I crammed for 7 hours and then I walked into the test.... and walked out 45 minutes later. I couldn't believe it. It went AWESOME. I walked out of there soooooo happy.

Now, the big challenge is getting a job. I have one job, or actually.. kind of two.. but I could get another job for mon-fri. Hopefully it'll work out, I gotta write my cover letter this weekend and apply online for the jobs I found on teh University website.

Other things I need to start to do: Running/biking.. etc. I really need to get back in shape. I don't want to sit around on my ass all summer doing nothing. So on sunday, I might go for a 10 minute run. There's no need for me to do too much. Then once ten minutes get too easy, up to 15.. then 20.. etc. Until i'm running a good fair amount. I think it'll be fine.

So tomorrow the 'rents are going to banff. That leaves me and my sisters up to nothing tomorrow night. Well, they are going to invite their friends and I'm going to have Jade here and then we get to chaperone them. (Yes I'm booting). Now, I'd much rather have my sisters drink around me when I can take care of them... because that idea seems much nicer than not knowing what they're up to. 

Alright. I gotta work tomorrow which means I should get some sleep. At least take my shower and stuff. MMMKAY."

I got my new laptop, an iBook. Ben gave it to me on one condition: that I do well in my studies. If I can keep a 3.2 GPA, it's mine. It's really a useful tool to do my work on. So I'm happy I have it.

I watched Troy with jade last night, fell asleep in the basement with him. Next thing I know, it's like.. 530 and I had to get upstairs. Not that I think it would have caused problems, I was in all my clothes.. I just got comfy and fell asleep.

So I headed off to work.


Work was busy as hell today. Just.. Lots of stuff to do, and instead of starting at 930, I started at 9. Just when we got there.

It was pretty busy. A line was already formed at the stairs.

Anywho, I was telling my autn about how many idiots frequent the restaurant. It's really quite annoying because they assume they can come and sit down and the table isn't relaly ready. It just causes a little bit of unnecessary stress, having to clean a table in front of a customer who is eyeing your every move. It's unnerving.

Damn day light savings. Bitches and whores, i'm going to be tired tomorrow. Oh well. I'll get at least 7 hours of sleep, and that's okay. I already know what i'm going to wear tomorrow, but I also have to get new jeans. I currently only have two pairs of pants. Time to get some new ones that are HAWT.

I have to withdraw

You have no clue what an idiot I feel like, having to withdraw from a second course. Ah well. lesson doubly learned. Joelle sucks and so does stats.

Plan: 
Go to MRC and apply for registration there. Going to take a couple classes maybe this summer (or just one..) to get credits transferred.. U of C has shit ass hours for their class availibility.
Hopefully, that works out.. and I'll have something nice to work with.

Apart from that life is dandy. I had another driving class thing. It was alright, but I seriously thought they would be worse than that. Sitting in a class learning this shit.. But it's actually not soo bad. I""ve learned quite a few usefull hints.. Some knowledge I wouldn't know if I hadn't taken the course.. Which is awesome.

Me and renee are planning on going to Toronto on may long.. That would kick major assage. But I dunno if i'll be able to go..... I really hope so, because it'd be super nice. I'd love to hang out with her, she's so awesome.. and I miss her to bits. We never really became friends until the end of grad year, so it was a shame that we had to part. But she's got this new car (A nissan Skyling r-32 turbo, 1989) and it RULES. It's also right hand drive (aka steering wheel is on the right side instead of left) and it's pretty cool.

There's a skyline conference thingy going on in the Tdot, but it's on a campground.. (or something) so ROAD TRIP BABY. Rock on.

Hokay. So I think that is all. I got a lot of work to do, chem stuff and shat. But it's all good. I can' twait to see Jade tomorrow, I've missed him. It's crazy, I miss him but it's not like.. this huge thing where i'm all sad and what not. I just want him around. I like sharing my time wth him, I like to make him laugh.. I like it when he makes me laugh. It's just something so.. peaceful. Sort of just there.. at this nice point where I can enjoy thoroughly.

I just love how he treats me like an equal, as I treat him. (I hope). My family loves him as well, which is always a super duper sign. And people ask if we've been dating for a while, although we've only been dating a couple weeks. It just seems like there is a great appreciation going on between us.. Some sort of understanding, or maturity.. or something. I've never been afraid to tell him anything, and he hasn't judged me... It's just refreshing to have that, ya know? I feel like i'm finally having an ADULT relationship, where he doesn't have to worry about me too much nor do I have to baby him. Ihated that about most my other relationships, I felt like I was the only one really thinking (or attempting to think) on a practical level.. and that was frustrating! I'm happy.

Talking to my baby on msn. I'm on webcam, he's not. Boo. I'd like to see him right now.. but ah well i'll live. Last night was Easter supper, and Jade came over for it. It was great fun.. Graham was here and so were the Scotts, and Tavia and her boys (minus Hunter). It was also Graham's bday, so we had cake. Poor guy was sooo hungover. lol.. It was quite funny.

Oh here's a picture of me and Jade from Thursday, when I shaved off his (gorgeous) hair.
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v292/xangelicdemonx/joelleandjade3.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com""></center>
I'm laughing because I""m tickling him. That picture is quite adorable, I have another copy of it on paper right here.. and another picture as well that we're both looking at the camera.

He's an awesome guy! My family loves him, and even Anabelle approves! (Trust me, she's an awesome judge of character, and she's been right about every other one of my boyfriends.. So having her like him is AWESOME) He likes that my family likes him, but he's also very humble (which is quite adorable, I might add) and he seems to be very.. amused with that.

Another thing we did last night was go see a movie with John. Now John's a great guy, really sincere and humble and has a great sense of humour. Also, he's totally a sweetheart, very well brought up. WE went to see Be Cool, which was an alright movie.. I just loved it due to the fact that it had John Travolta and Uma Thurman. They are great actors. Mel Brooks was in it too, the last movie I saw him in was SpaceBalls (anyone remember that???) and Vince Vaughn was pretty fucking hilarious too. Then me and Jade got home, made his bed... watched tv and killed some time.

So generally, a good evening.

Today, I had school (my sisters, on the other hand, are off) and I went to class. How boring was Stats? I swear, I wanna kill Dr. Nosal (well, in my head at least. Not for real, so no worries I'm not going to go mass murderer on your asses). He's the biggest idiot EVER. I swear to god, I wish he ddnt' have his 10 year at Uni... Apparently he's also a perv. But I don't want to know.

Alright. Time for bed. going to talk to Jade a bit more and then knock out. I'm freaking tired. Having 4 hours of sleep doesn't help (yeah yeah keep your crude, dirty comments to yourselves, pervs).

I need to do my hair. This is the point where I am most girly; getting ready to go out. Usually, I can do without the girly antics, the gossip, the talking.. Just most of the girly persona.. Until you ask me to go out with you. A night out on the town is nothing short of me trying to impress you.

I want to be sexy. I want to be hot.. And most importantly, I wanna look damn classy.

None of that ""slutacular"" shit. That is stupid and I hate to be one of the girls who looks like a whore who would do any bum off the street. Well, I am also taken. So I'm not going to whore it up at the Rusty Cage. heh. That would be interesting.

But yes.

If only Elise would call me. Buhhhhh. She's probably screwing her boyfriend or something. Bahah. Sorry that was crude, but it's hilarious. When I reached 15, my life suddenly changed in the ""sexual"" department. I told elise about how I lost my virginity and all this shit. Well, she lost hers recently and I found it surprising. Well not really, everyone goes there at some point in their life. But I'm a very open person about sexuality,and I've always found a way to talk about it.

Ah yes. I just called her. Probably in an hour, we'll get going. That will give me enough time to pretty myself up.

Anabelle got an iPod. It is a beautiful thing. I wonder if I've alreayd mentioned it.. but meh. If I have, just shoot me or something. It is actually an iPod mini. Sure sure, 4 GB music.. WEAK. But actually, i'm thinking of getting one.

I just have 1.61 GB of songs. I should get an iPod shuffle. Because seriously, I don't need 4 GB.. but then again, I could carry so much music..

Lots has happened at the gauntlet. The biggest problem lately has been with Ben and Dale. There was a photo in the paper which caused quite a bit of controversy. It was a nude picture of a stripper. Of course, you couldn't see her face.. and seriously, it wasn't like you could see parts. Probably just the outside of her vagina.

Anywho, she went to the Calgary Herald and made a huge deal of it. They put her pic in there.. and she's holding a Moral Philosophy book. She claimed she was ashamed of the University and could never return. This has arisen into a huge issue. But really, it's unimportant. In the end, Dale and Ben got suspended from their jobs, 2 and 3 weeks.

Ah well, that will all keep going. Obviously.

In other news.... I'm now dating this wonderful guy named Jade. He's such a sweetheart, honestly one of the nicest guys I know. My family loves him, and I just.. enjoy my time with him so much. I also got a new job.. at Nellie's in the Loop. Anabelle works there too, she isn't thrilled wth the prospect that I have to be there too, but she's quitting soon.

I mean, how does this differ from any other day? You don't know where your day will take you.. but it's more in curiosity that you continue. On the other hand, for myself lately, I feel out of place.. I feel like I'm swimming through a gel of confusion. Sounds strange? Yeah, i think so too.
Well it just seems odd. I'm feeling lonely, but i'm not alone. I want something out of things. Even more odd.
I'm sick again. That partially makes me feel very crumby, and also dampens my spirits although I shoudln't allow it to. Since I got banned from the office (Gauntlet) I seem to feel even more lost. At least from there I can relax and learn to get over things that are bugging me. But for now, I just wander the halls at school trying to find a way to find comfort in things that seem so alien to me.
The entire university is plastered with posters of the candidates running for certain positions in the Students' Union. One thing I was interested in learning about today was that the ""tuition freeze"" the gov't is proposing isn't a tuition freeze. By those standards, Bryan West (who is a very great guy) makes himself look very good because he's been SU president this past year. His entire campaign centers around having a tuition freeze; the guy who made the cover for the last Gauntlet, Adam Berti, actually is his campaign manager. By putting TUITION FREEZE as the cover for this gauntlet, we're making West look great. How the fuck does that work?
Of course, I don't mind West. But some of his tactics did get under my skin. Especially because there is a huge thing going on in the office about Ben being ""biased"" towards Chris. Like, seriously... people should get over themselves. Ben would never be biased, he's much more professional than that. It's just bugging me that I can't even help him up there. 
Oh well. I suppose that's something we're going to have to face. Luckily, there wil be reading week for everyone to take a break from all this shit. Maybe that way we can get people to actually cool their jets about this entire Election, which has seriously affected too many people in a way that shouldn't be affecting them.

Yesterday a little fight happened at the Gauntlet, one that really shouldn't have happened and which could have been avoided quite easily. John, Wayne and I were discussing human rights, aborotion, religion.. etc etc. Which one would say is quite nice, I enjoy discussions like this, but I did not yesterday. First, Wayne called me stupid because I thought the Calgary Sun isn't a good publication, and I had no ""reasoning"" behind it. Therefore I am biased.

Now, I never agree with calling people anything even if they piss me off. Sure, Wayne has never been the most respectful guy, he is a zealot when it comes to religion, but I can live with it because it isn't affecting me. Except when he calls me stupid, ignorant.. etc. And, by telling me that I will bow to God when I face the day of judgement..... I'm not all too impressed. 

Well, John is gay, and Wayne is conservative/religious (Christian, to be exact Protestant). I am Liberal/Cahtholic.. not overly religious, but I believe in certain things when it comes to the church. Anyway, I am having this discussion with wayne and john about gay marriage which I shoudln't be having in the first place.. but something pissed John off and he told Wayne to bite him.

Wayne threw his pen at John, then told him that he wanted to punch John.
John picked up a piled of newspapers, and I went in front of Wayne to stop it, telling them they couldn't do this... Of course, Wayne tries to push me over, I run in front of him to stop him from going around the table to John, and I just start screaming for something to stop them.

Next thing I know, I'm being interviewed by campus Security because they think wayne hit me.. etc etc etc.

This entire thing wouldn't have gone so terribly if they hadn't called security, now everyone at the office is feeling the pressure. I have to write an apology to wayne, but I don't know if I can because I really won't be apologizing. Just by writing a letter and having a document about it to say that I apologized isn't going ot make me feel better, to tell you the truth. I mean, I never said anything to Wayne that shoiuld diminish how he felt, I never called him anything.. he called me names and he said things that insulted me.. 
Then again, Wayne says that me and John ganged up on him (well not exactly) and argued together. I didn't necessarily agree with John 100%, I did tell him not to say certain things and I did walk out of the room.


The outcome:

I have this huge problem on my hands adding all this unnecessary stress, I have a Sexual Awareness Supplement to do; and I can't even be in the office to do it because my membership has been suspended for the time being.

I can't do my new typesetting job because of my suspension, I have to write this letter to Wayne, and a letter to the Editors about this.. I want to go tot he board about this thing, but I have nothing to say. I don't want to be politically incorrect.

I feel like I've lost my fellow co-workers' respect. By stopping a fight that could have been potentially dangerous, I have caused an even bigger issue. I feel like it is partially my fault, and that there is absolutely nothing I can do to fix it. What happens if this issue never settles at the Gauntlet? Will it ever be the same?

Chris pointed out something really great about this: When Kyle slapped me one night at the Gauntlet (we had all been drinking) no one was alerted and nothing had precipitated by it. Now, due to the fact that Wayne just shoved me to get to John, this entire thing has blown up out of proportion, and I have john saying things about Wayne, I can't see my good friend Ben... He's probably stressed out about this incident and I can't even eliviate some of it.

I wanted to work ont he sex supplement SOOOO bad. This was going to be my thing to prove to the other Editors that I am capable of editing, layout and etc. This was going to be my thing. *sigh* I just can't believe that this has to be like this.

I'm obviously frustrated, but I've surrendered to the fact that this is just a load of bureaucracy that has to be sorted out.. I feel like I can't be treated differently than the guys, but I cannot be shoved away from this when all I really did, in the end, was stop a stupid fight from happening. 

But then that just sounds selfish.

I don't know what to think about it anymore. All I know is that I've lost something because I can't go to the office anymore, I feel lost.. uprooted.. and just........ insulted. If only this could go away."

"event","<b>Here I am sitting in sweats and a sweater, with my hair tied up in two buns at the back of my head and a hairband (lululemon hairband haha) on my head. I'm comfortable.

My bus comes in about.... 15 minutes. Even a little earlier than that. I am not in the mood to rush this morning, I just want to chill and relax.... or even ""chillax"" for lack of a better word that could do chill-relax some justice.

Nexopia is down. my my what is the world coming to. Last night, it was down for FOUR hours. How the fuck did I survive that? Well, I set out to do some homework. 8:30pm. .... Hmm people are on msn. *chat*. 9:30pm. .... Check nexopia.. Still down. Rats. 10:30pm. .... Ooh my homework is sitting there; omg i actually wrote down a chem equation! 11:30pm.... playing games with my e-friends on msn... *yawn* 12:30am YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS it's up! 
So, I chat it up on nex.. And i'm all like tired. Finally go to bed at 130. Gah. 

This morning is pretty killer. I""m tempted to sleep in my bed alllllll day today. That would be nice. Hmm.. Reminiscent of some good times this weekend.. baha.

So, my class starts in about 55 minutes. Will I make it? Probably 10 minutes late.. I betcha. I'm tempted to go make myself a bagel and just sit here for a bit, stay on msn and talk to a couple people and just let the time go by.

So I bought Troy over the weekend. Mr. Hot (aka Brad Pitt) and I have a date. I like to view his nice ass (drool) once in a while. I've been without the Pitt ass for a bit, and it's bringing me down. Oh well, gotta find a substitute for the meanwhile.

Until I can get my hands on Mr Pitt, I really have to stick to some more realistic goals. Last night, i mentioned a ""crush"" I had. Well I guess it wouldn't really be a crush, because crushes never really end up playing out. Crush is a way to say ""I liked him, he didn't like me"".

Well, Mr. Crush likes me, or so I'm under the suspicion that he does... If he doesn't he's a very good liar. Apparently, he doesn't think a girl like me could like him. Pssssssssssch. Shut up Mr. Chrush, I like you damned well and you better live with it, that's what I think! 

A few friends have shown concern, a few support. Concern, you asked? Well Mr. Crush and I were kissing on Firday night. -gasp- Friday? Isn't that the day after Thursday, you ask... Yeah yeah yeah. So I kissed a guy after I broke up with Loveofmylife Kyle.

Rebound? No. How do I know it's not a rebound? I""ve been over kyle for a few weeks now. Ever since Jan 1st fight, I haven't been very in like with him, and this is such a sad thing... really though, I did not dump Kyle for Mr. Crush... I did this as a decision for myself.

Kyle asked me why i broke up with him, and I just denied to even tell him. It's like ""no comment"" in a way. I dunno. There are so many reasons.. Way too many to explain and really, I didn't want to spend an hour explaining every freaking reason why we broke up. The main things were simple: distance, I didn't love him as much, I didn't like the attitude he gave me... I finally found some independence from him, and it made me really happy to be away from it all. When I looked at my relationship, I felt like I was questioning it... 

Finally, someone gave me some good advice... (thanks Mr. Crush, you are a good friend) I was too scared to break up with Kyle because I couldn't face the fact that I could hurt him extremely. That made me really sad.. the potential of breaking his heart just made me feel like I was a bitch. I just had to see that just because I couldn't hurt him doesn't mean I was happy. I wans't fully happy. And by staying in this relationship, I'm just hurting kyle in the long run. I'm letting it drag out and I'm letting it get away.

Oh well. It's done now. And really, I feel like a huge weight has lifted off my shoulders.

Ah yes. Now if only I could just laze around in bed all day... I would feel complete.</b>"

"event","Life is constantly changing, I think we all know that. I've had a very interesting couple days. 
I broke up with Kyle. This seems a little out of character, but I think it isn't. Thing is, since the big fight at the beginning of January, I've lost a little of what I used to have for him. My feelings were not the same, and seriously, it was unfair to make it seem right and try to stick through it. Part of me really felt like I couldn't leave him, but really... it's not very logical to stay with him. 

The way he dealt with it was not the way I would have wanted it to be. Seriously, it seems almsot crazy that within 2 hours of a conversation, someone you used to share so much with could turn around so maliciously and try to destroy what you were saying. 
""You're not the person I met 3 years ago, I don't know you anymore,"" he said.
""You're a wolf in sheep's clothing, and I feel bad for any guy who is dumb enough to fall for you and can't see right through you.""

Sure, we all say things in anger. Even so, it was in his character to get the last word (the last quote was said on msn after he hung up on me) and I wasn't so surprised.. but at that point, I had stopped caring. If you say something to someone you claimed to love and out of self-protection all you do is sit there and say they aren't the person you know... you're not justifying yourself int he right way.

Hell, I'm not perfect.. but I have never thought I'm completely in the right. He had been right about some suspicions: he thought I was cheating on him. Now let me explain myself, I didn't cheat on him. I could never imagine cheating on anyone, I made that mistake once and I never wanted to go back. But really, in my mind, I cheated on him.

Atrraction to other men is normal during a relationship... right? Well.. maybe if you don't see anything int he relationship you are in.. but that does not excuse anything, that's for sure. Innocent flirting is great and all, and I tend to do that to an extent that is not to be worried about.

Having him ask me if I cheated on him almost made me want to do it. How dare he even FATHOM the thought of me cheating on him. He claims he trusts me more than himself... and yet he says I am cheating. CHEATING. But then, you ask, why had I thought about other guys? Well there is always a little temptation on the other side, but not one with a little more essence than a little innocent flirting. Friends I have met recently have pricked my curiosity.

After having spoken to a couple of them about a recent event (New year's eve party) I had started to doubt my significant other. Of course, I would never base my decision SOLELY on the fact that my friends had a few concerns, there were many many more reasons than that. A few common concerns seemed to pop up. Respect was one.

My friends had told me of the instance where I had gotten sick on New years. They tell Kyle. He listened to the dj who was spinning beofre my friend Matt actually helps carry me downstairs and then Kyle takes care of me.

*sigh* I do care for Kyle alot, but that sorta hurts me. Really. Kyle is a very good guy, but like everyone else (Myself included) he has his faults. I loved him faults and all. 

Seriously though, after a while of thinking, his attitude got me down as well as my own thoughts. Having thought out almost every single possible outcomes... and none seemed to cater to what I wanted. I felt stuck and needed some help. My friend Angus had said that maybe I should just think about myself. He wouldn't say anything on the subject of what he thought of Kyle, but he knew that I had to think about myself in this situation. The hardest thing about relationships is that until the point where you break up, you usually care about what the other person thinks, right?

Well, in the end Kyle and I broke up. I felt a little drained on Friday, but that was from lack of sleep and having to have lost a friend. 

All I can do is wait for something next to happen."

This past couple weeks has been absolute hell, and I tell you.. it's quite interesting.

Kyle was here for christmas.. He was here for a few weeks. After a huge fight (Which I will not get into details because there is no point), we have finally gotten over it a little. Now, I'm back to school and I'm totally ready to embark (sp?) on a journey towards me getting my stuff done.

I can't be in Phys223, I got a D+ in Phys211, so I will have to retake that course. Hell, it does suck, but it also gives me the oppurtunity to take a Stats class (which I need for Dentistry) and get back on track without having to worry about Physics. God knows how much I hate physics. 

As well as the wonderful thing going about with Biology 233... I couldnt' get in it because I needed to get into a lab.. after a while of waiting, I finally got it.. Fuck I am just so ecstatic.

This semester is going to rock. I'm going to work so hard to get this whole thing going :)"

"event","So last sunday was my 18th birthday. It's been a barrel of fun since then.

On friday of last week, the Gauntlet had their little christmas party and we partied it up. Man, did I drink alot. Before we headed out to the bar, I had a good few tequila shots and some rum and coke. Good times. Then, we went downtown to eat (Chinese food yo) and to the bar we went. By then, I was sober enough to hav ea couple more drinks and be fine.

That was a good night. Had some good chats, met new people.. good times my friend.

On Saturday, Renee surprised me by coming by work and taking me out. At 1 AM Sunday morning, we went to Melrose bar on 17th and we had a few drinks (not to mention before 12, we went to BP's lounge to shoot some pool and swig down a couple shots). I love hanging out with Renee. That girl just cracks me up, we always have a crazy good time. We spent some time out on the Red Mile last year.. and those were the days.

On Sunday, I had my gift-opening time and got lots of really nice things. A scarf that I wanted, some things from Nana (including a nice new Roots watch that I really like), some new make up (Mac eyeshadow compact with 6 colours, to be precise) and Diamond earrings. They are SOOOO beautiful.. I absolutely adore them, and I haven't taken them off since. Then, we went to Dim Sum for brunch (Oh god that was good) and had sooo much food. 

Later that night, I went to my Choir concert (which was very very good) and later went home (Boy was I pooped) and passed out.

Monday, went to the Den. Had a few drinks. Was happy.

Tuesday, went home. 

Wednesday, went to the Den. Had another few drinks.

Tonight, went to a pub crawl. Had a great freaking time.. a few drinks.. and it didn't cost me much (we got the ticks for free).

I miss Kyle. He's moving here this Saturday.. and I'm partially nervous and partially fucking excited. I can't wait fr him to ACTUALLY be here, instead of me feeling like a loser because my boyfriend lives so far away.

Apart from that, i'm fucking tired.. So, I think it's time I hit the Hay.

Night."

"event","My life is so hectic lately.. but I love the busy-ness of it all. 
one more week, and I will finally be an official ""adult"", well.. At least in Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec. Ha. Apart from that.. It's another major step in my life, I suppose. Now, I get so many doors opened to me.. but others closed.
For example, I no longer have any use for lots of my insurance. Health insurance covers me until I'm 18 for money off glasses.. but once I hit that age I have to pay full price. However, now I get to vote.. I get to go into bars, I get to have a little more freedom.... but does responsibility go hand in hand?
Definitely.
I want to better myself as a person. I really want to learn some things.. That's why I think I  am going to try to change my ways a little more. Like I said, I've started to work out.. I will continue that. I will eat healthier, not bring my debit to school.... etc etc. I really want to set up some goals and go for them!

So my first goal:
Study for my exams, finish off this semester on a semi-good note... And be happy.

Totally.

I have been slacking so much lately, I am going to get on track with some things..................
Firstly, I have to spend less time on Nexopia. Oh my dearest beloved site. I have 18000 posts on it.. I remember when I used to post in forums and I was excited when I reached like.. 800 posts, and no one had as mych as me.. but now.. I'm at 18000 posts (wow what a waste one might say) and still going strong.. and it consumes way too much time from my life.

Gauntlet is awesome. Wicked awesome fun. Gauntlet is my second home in university.. or rather my first.. when really, the library should be my first. SO. I think I should make the library my first. Eh? Maybe.

I got a few CD reviews to write for the gauntlet.. fuck I might just write one tonight. I got LOTS AND LOTS to work from for this week.. like super cool yo. And we just got our hoodies from the G-unit. They rule. 

Today, I ran on the treadmill. Twas good fun.. really. I think next week I'll be going a few times.. just want to get back into shape, that's all. It was nice to go and run. It gave my legs a little bit of a workout.. cool stuff.

AND MY BIRTHDAY IS WITHIN THE 1 WEEK MARK :D :D :D :D :D :D :D

you have no clue how excited I am for it. No.. freaking... clue.

This is gonna rule. Next week will be great!

"event","Its been forever since I've actually been here. And I have sooo much shit to dish out.  Been back to school for a while now, its almost christmas!  At the beginning of the school year, I dated Kyle Thornley (which was a pretty stupid thing to do.) for about.. 1 month and a half.  I dumped him after I got fed up with his stupid bullshit.  So, by mid-october, I was single again.  Kyle H. is still with Shera (and he totally loves her, I can tell.) and Jess was with Jeff (still is) etc etc. Cadets started again and boy isnt that fun! I got promoted to Cpl. (corporal for all you civilians out there) and so now i'm actually a little more useful than i was before.. Yet.. Not really. Ah well, one more step up and I""m going to be a sergeant.. Yes! haha. Choir is great. I made it into Vocal Ensemble at school.. Which is freaking awesome.. I'm not sure how many people were auditioning for soprano, but it was something like.. 10 girls for 3 spots. I got a perfect score on my audition. We have performed so many times, and I'm loving it. Sam and Marta also auditioned, but they didnt make it... Marta TOTALLY deserved it though.. Poor girl. Ah well. She also started dating Kjell (I think thats spelt correctly) at the same time that me and Kyle T. started dating.. adn they're still together. Congrats hunny!
So school started and it was sooo great to be back. We are now back into the whole stupid high school drama-rama again.. oh woohoo.. (not) and I've actually kept out of most of it. (or tried very hard to)
Sam got promoted to F/Sgt in cadets, and everyone was having a heart attack over it. People could not believe that she got it.. Everyone was soo angry. On rememberance day, we hung out. She came over and then we went to the mall. She was angry cause Danielle and Laurence were hanging out, and I was just like.. Meh. Me and Danielle werent really close back then.
So me and Sam hung out all day. By that time, I told her how I was sick of people complaining about her getting promoted, and She told me that she obviously deserved it. I dunno. I guess she did. But i did remind her not to be so.. emotional when we're at Cadets, but that didnt change the way she acts there. I mean, yeah, so some people do have a tough break here and there, but I got soo fed up with her complaining. Most recently, I got pretty pissed off at her and yelled at her in the hall before we were off to a choir concert later that evening. And, of course, Its not exactly the first option in my books, but I guess I was soo fed up with everything. The thing that trigured the whole affair was Jourdain. Now, this guy is quite the story.  total womanizer, total.. Guy.  Loves girls, etc.. I mean, he's just a guy! Totally full of testosterone. We started talking a little back in i dunno.. April, after I went to the avril lavigne concert.  Not much really. He was just a guy I had on my list, one of sam's friends. The way I met him really, was that she was talking to him on msn, and I was like.. oh who's that.. And she flipped out and told me not to add him cause he was ""Steve, the drummer from Sum41"".  So, of course, as almost to prove her wrong, or me wrong, I added him. ""Hey, who is this?"" I asked when he came online one day.
""Jourdain"" he stated simply, ""Who's this?""
""Oh, Joelle. I""m one of Sam's friends""
""Cool.""
""Yeah, she told me you were steve, the drummer from Sum41, But i geuss you're not""
Well, thats not exactly the convo we had.. but it was along the lines of that.
How is this of ANY importance, you may ask?
Well, after a while, We started talking a little more. Although, how.. I dont know.
I thought he was the general ideal player, a ladies man, I mean.. he knew how to talk the talk, and I probably am right by saying he prolly knew how to walk the walk.
At first, we just talked a little, especially about raiders atlantis, a cadet leadership function in Penhold. He emailed a bunch of girls asking for them to send underwear to him for his ""collection"" (yes he has an underwear collection.. believe it or not) and I was like.. Nuhuh.. You're not getting my underwear cause my bf (Kyle T.) would be pissed. And he was like.. who cares about the bf, everyone knows i'm much better (he loves to say this type of thing lol..) and I was like.. Well, if you want to have my underwear, you're gonna have to come down here and get it yourself.. So you'll have to get down here, get into my house and grab some.. and leave. 
(Note, he lives up in Peace River, and I live in Calgary.)
And he was like.. yeah right, go to raider atlantis and I""ll get it then. Lol.. So i was like.. no way i have a bf. And he said that wouldnt be stoppping me.
So you get the general idea. I mean, yeah, we flirted and whatever, but it was all fair and fun, in my opinion. Soon afterwards, me and Kyle broke up (and no, Jourdain had NO involvement for my feeligs towards kyle) and me and him started to get even closer. Talked on msn alot.. One day, we talked on the phone.. I mean.. We just talked.. about everything. He told me about his life experiences.. and all that.
The night that really did it for me, to know that I really did like this guy, was when I told him about Kyle H. He then told me a story that I wont share on here, its much too personal.. But I was touched because he trusted me with that. I guess thats when I really realized I was.. well.. to be subtle, Crazy about him.
I hate distance. For some odd reason, I am usually stuck in the Long distance relationship. Why? I mean.. I hate it. I really fucking hate it.. A lot. Dont get me wrong, I mean.. You can love a person soo much that it doesnt matter.. but its fucking hard. 
And i fell in love. Completely in love. I mean, I havent felt this good in almost two years. Its like.. a whole.. new experience. Its the greatest feeling on earth. And, if anyone has been in love before, they'd understand teh whole wacky reason of why I'm dating someone who lives almost 7 hour drive away.
Its a lot of work. I asked him out on Dec 7th, two days aafter my 17th birthday. He was supposed to come on Dec 12th into calgary, but we decided it'd be best to wait and For  him to come here during christmas holidays. Now, it's christmas holidays, and he is supposed to come next Monday or wahtever.. (29th)
Of course, there is a chance he wont come.. But I really hope that he does. I think about him all the time.. And i miss him soo much. We talk on the phone almost every night.. I have pictures of him in my locker.. and Every school day when I see them I smile.
Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, But I dont care. I have him and he has me. And, as mushy and corny as it sounds... I'm so.. happy.. and .. fulfilled.
Lets just hope my baby comes here next week."

First, as I have said in my previous entry, I went to Kelowna for a couple weeks. Well, we came back and then I got my cast off on the 28th.. We cleaned up the house and left on the 1st of August for N.B. (for all you non-canadian-legitimate-short-term people, thats for New-Brunswick) Wow.. I cannot say how great that was.. it was awesome to see all my family.
Family?? Well that includes my Grand-maman Robichaud, my uncles Camille, Claude, Eric, and Yves, my aunts Francine, Claudette, Joanne and Patricia, my cousins Guy, Stephane, Serge, Daniel, Andre, Paul, Louise (who got married while we were there), and finally Charles and Samuel (or Sammy). Haha.. Oh the memories.
First, we arrived at Moncton's airport (its.. soo small) and then we went to matante Claudette's house. We stayed there for a few days, went to P.E.I for one day and hung out with Andre.. Boy that was fun.. sooo fun. I loved it. PEI is SO beautiful its just so gorgeous out there and we spent the whole day sightseeing despite the bad weather.
Then, we drove to Shippagan.. Now this place is sooo small.. I'd say its prolly a little smaller than Canyon Meadows.. oh hell, WAY smaller than Canyon Meadows.. (yep its pathetic) they have a SAAN (yuck), a couple grocery stores, a subway, a tim hortons(i had timmy's almost every day.. and subway too) two little pizza places, 3 clothing stores.. 2 hair dressers and, of course, a liquor store(which i also visite a few times with my cousins) haha.. They even have a school and a church and a couple gas places.. a book store.. stuff like that.. but only one tiny book store. not like a chapters or anything.. and Yep.. Only ONE school. Not to mention they have one hell of a lot of fishing boats (along with an Aquatic center and restaurant) and finally they have the University of Moncton Campus (which is really small).
Anywho, we arrived at our little cabin (it was a two bedroom cabin which was soo small but i liked it) next to the sea. Boy it was beautiful. There were tons of Jellyfish around there.. pretty funny.
For the first week, we were all alone up there (exept for the visits with my grandma and her relatives and some of my dad's friends) The rest of the family didnt arrive until the week after.. And the weather was pretty crappy and cloudy that week.
Finally, family started to ship in haha.. and we hung out with the cousins like.. every night.. man, I only have one cousin who's a girl.. and we didnt really visit with her. Most of the time, we would hang out at matante Claudette/Francine's cabin, which was really close to ours (we could walk there faster than drive there) And man.. My cousins fucking rule.. They are the sweetest guys in the world, they seriously watch over me and my sisters (cause we're the only other chicks in the family) and they just get hammered.. like.. all the time when they're together.. So for the first few nights they were there we'd bundle up at the fire and talk for hours on end. Finally, On the 14th, we went to Tracadie, where my aunt Joanne and her husband Eric stayed, also, Louise and her Fiance David stayed int he cabin next to them, along with a cluster of David's family (in different cabins of course). I got to hang out with Louise and David and his cousin at the beach.. It was beautiful, although very cold haha.. and we left and hung out at the pool with the rest of the fam. Then, we had to jet and went back home with my godparents/uncle/aunt Yves and Patricia (they stayed in shippagan with my grandma, and Charles and Samuel are really close in age to us so we hung out with them alot). Also that week, we went kayaking with a whole bunch of us, we went shopping and we played video games.. blah blah..  Fast forward.. on the 15th, there's this thing called the Tintamarre, and its when people gather and make noise. yeah.. they actually close off streets and people dress in acadian flags and weird costumes and what not and make as much noise as they can. There was a bbq at Louise's Grandma's house (different granny), and I met this cute guy named Pierre.. (haha he is such a cutie) we flirted and what not.. Then we went to the Tintamarre (we were in this place called Caraquet) and soon left.. Me and Pierre went to the beach and threw some rocks.. woop-dee-doo haha. A few hours later, I left with my fam and we went back to the cabin. Next day: the Wedding!
We went to the Shoppers to get some nail polish and stuff.. And I got my hair done. I had a bite at timmy's and we soon went back to the Cabin and got ready for the big event. 
The service (which was held in the church at Shippagan) was beautiful. My cousin really is in love with this guy and its soo cute. He's the funniest guy.. he's kinda.. girly tho but still he's the sweetest thing.. He's still got all his hair (unlike umm.. basically everyone in my family) so people were pretty amazed by him. We had pictures after the ceremony, and Pierre came up to me and told me how beatiful i looked (i was wearing a halter top dress made out of this satiny stuff.. it was a relaly gorgeous dress) and I returned the favor (of course half jokingly half true) and then my family started taking more pictures.. so i had to leave him and take pictures.. Then I left with Daniel, Serge, and Michele (that's Serge's gf). We were driving along to Michele's grandma's cabin.. And it started to POUR outside. We were coming back to Shippagan, and we went into Subway (i was hungry) and I got some food.. We stepped outside and it was like a fucking monsoon! So we hopped into the car and went to Matante Claudette's cabin.. we had a blast, soon, ppl started to leave to go to the reception. Me and Serge and Michele drove to Tracadie (yep back to the cabins) cause the Reception was held in the big cabin by Louise's cabin. It was a nice place to have a reception.
So, I arrive, and I spot Pierre, who was drinking champagne (he's 18.. and his parents let him drink although the age is 19 in NB) and we started to talk when Paul (louises' brother, who was MC) invited us into the reception room (we were gathered in the front room) So we all sat at our tables, of course, all the troublemakers were in the corner (andre, daniel, guy, stephane, anabelle) blah blah and there were about.. 10 tables in total (11 if you count the ""couple's"" table. We're all drinking champagne (yeah i snuck a glass, michele gave me it) and then the couple enters.. there were toasts and then there was food and more toasts.. and before our food came out (it was like.. a buffet kinda thing going on) Paul announces theres an Open Bar.. (OPEN BAR?????) haha.. ooooooooooooh boy. so pierre (of course) proceeded to get a beer.. when i went to get my food, he got me a pur source.. Soon, people were chatting and there were more toasts and there was more drinking and the cousins in the corner were getting roudier (they were drinking too.. and were giving drinks to anabelle oh hahaha) I hung out with pierre, he had his arm around me and we were chatting with his sister and brother.. And i had a drink or two more (i didnt drink that much in fear of getting in trouble) but pierre had a few more beers. He was sitting there and started getting closer and he would like.. kiss my neck (nothing bad! i swear) and soon, we just wanted to get outside (we danced alittle, much to his displeasure.. he had fun tho) so we snuck outside to watch the thunderstorm which was far away by now. We walked around a little and we kissed but i swear nothing bad happened. I wouldnt allow anything to happen.. then we came back and rumours were flying around about us.. haha.. I laughed at half of them (apparently i went into a car with him, and stuff.. weird..) and then.. after about an hour's worth of talking/cuddling together he had to leave. I gave him my email, but he never emailed me (i'll call my uncle to find out his number) I guess it was kinda cause he was drunk he must've misplaced it. lol.. 
Then, we left the party (after about 2 hours of dancing omg it was SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
Then, the rest of our vacation soon came to a close. We went back to moncton to stay at my aunt claudette's and we left the next day. Of course, that is a whole otehr story.. oh boy.. 
we went to the airport on the 19th. Thye had mis-booked our flights so me and mom were gonna catch a later flight. There was this cute guy on the plane and I saw him a couple times but didnt really think anything of it. Then, in Hamilton, we switched flights. My mom asked me if i wanted the window seat and I said Sure. Turns out, the cute guy was sitting in the aisle seat.. Yeah.. next to me and mom. So, i kinda wanted to switch spots with her. To ""chat it up"" or whatever.. meh. So, when we arrived in Saskatoon, i switched places with her.. oh wait, back up.. From Hamilton to Saskatoon, I noticed that Mr. Cute guy was kinda acting different.. oooooooooooooooooooooh boy. Lets just say, his pillow was on his lap and he seemed to be having a good.. time.. I almost pissed myself laughing when I noticed this.. I mean, dude.. we were in a crowded airplane adn as much as i know that guys have this weird need to.. Do stuff like that sometimes.. but still we're on a freaking plane.. So I was laughing.. and trying to read my book. ITs kinda hard to read a book when you see things like that in your peripheral vision. But, I managed to read. Then, me and mom switched seats.. and teh horny cute guy turned out to be pretty cool.. But I dotn think i'll be hanging out with him anytime soon. We talked and what not but there was like.. nothing else but that.
Finally, we got home. Its so good to be home, even tho I miss NB, I miss all my cousin's and family.
Yeah.. so That took an hour to write up.. haha.."

My sisters painted and i helped out with some computer stuff. I couldnt paint cause of my wrist. I broke it! i was skating at millenium and went down my favourite ramp. fell pretty hard. It was harsh cause i've never wiped out on it before, and i've gone down it like.. so many times. haha.. bruised up my knees pretty bad too. haha. so i couldnt swim caus ei have a splint cast thing that i cant get wet.. and therefore i worked on my tan. i got pretty good. not as dark as i would have liked.. but meh its all good.

"event","Well its 2:30 in the morning and i'm sitting here on my ass being a computer geek as usual. Just talked to kyle for a good bit of time, talked about everything.. sex and relationships and we played a good old game of questions (me and kyle's game.. its like.. just the way we are lol).
Life is relatively good. i'm happy. I'm still single but enjoying it, there's bound to be someone out there for me. It still surprises me how the whole ""first love"" concept is sooo stuck with me. No no, I AM (totally 100%) over kyle, but still, the whole experience sticks with ya no matter what. And many of my friends do agree. No matter how many times you do fall in love, the first one does soo stick with you through it all. And, it doesnt necessarily mean that you'd jump back into your first love's arms again. Everything seems kinda differnet lately, dont ask me how.. just does. I went to the stampede on monday.. with my buddy alex (from cadets), first we went to millenium for four hours (that was fun) and then went to stampede. We went ride crazy and then went to the Gob concert, where i was almost smashed in a mosh pit. lol.. I think i'm much too small to be near one cause i just fly every time someone hits me.. lol.. i got a few bumps and bruises from that. I got to see gabe again, saw him last when we went to the avril lavigne concert (i didnt write about that.. i met the guys from gob backstage and avril herself.. pretty cool i guess , but i'm not really a fan of hers).. Gabe is the drummer from gob, and i got to say hey and see what was up.
What else is new.. Umm i went shopping today, got shorts and a bag and some cell phone $$ and some sunglasses.
Well, time to continue the nice game of questions with kyle."

She wandered through the dark night, with gold in her pockets and a ticket to nowhere.
Her hair in her face and her nails digging into her palms, she thinks her fate is fair.
The silver moon is hanging in the sky, it seems to peer from the heavens above.
Ignoring it, she jumps on her stead, and they fly as if on the wings of a dove.
The stars shine, but not for her, they shine for millions on this over-grown earth.
Men working, children playing, even mothers giving birth.
Why the Gods condemmed her, she'll never know.
But every day she'll continue to watch these people grow.
The love for her people will never cease, every day it shall always increase.
She closes her eyes and takes in the air, her face being covered from her long silky hair.
She wandered as a stranger, with gold in her pockets and a ticket to nowhere.

Just some poetry...

"event","Summer is officially here in Calgary, the sun is shining and its gorgeous outside, yet I'm stuck here on teh computer (cause i'm like.. sooo dependent of the computer) lol.. so whats new in my life.. The Harry Potter book (#5) came out this weekend, I finished it yesterday (its only been out for umm.. 5 days and i'm done it) I basically devoured it.. I highly recommend all you peeps read it..
I got pictures back from like.. way last year that were soo old.. There was one from when kyle was here in august (yeah august 4th.. whoa big date there) and i looked at it.. it was me and kyle.. and i seriously thought i was gonna cry. Kinda weird seeing that i'm completely over him and all, but I totally forgot about the picture and it just seemed to hit me.. I was surprised i suppose you could say. of course, i didnt' cry.. lol.. that would have been kinda weird, and if i did i think i would be bashing my head in for all that shit. 
And, i got these pictures from a party in December, Vanessa's 17th bday party... OMG those are fucking hilarious. All these drunk people sprawled on beds, and hanging off of me (i wasnt drunk)oh the memories.. andt ehre are pictures of jess and sam and vanessa and danielle.. But i noticed that the onlything I dont have pictures of is cadets.. weird shit there. Cause, i've had so much fun at cadets.. but no pictures or ""object"" memory lol.. just my boot box and my uniform.. ah well, next year i'll go crazy and take so many pictures of everything I do.. I'm gonna be picture crazy. haha..
la la la.. she said i'll throw myself away.. they're only photos after all... (lol sorry a little queens of the stone age for all you people..)

"event","God bless everyone of my friends. I swear i would never know what to do without them.
The few people who mean so much to me right now are Claire, Kyle and Keith.  They are kinda like past/present/future, kyle for past, claire for present and keith for future. Today, Claire realized that she's in love with Edd, her bf. He's the sweetest guy on earth. And, I was having another long chat with Kyle (yep.. another one of them three hour chats) and we were talking about his girlfriend and how happy he is. Lately, i've been really feeling down adn so alone, seems like everyone is in a happy, stable relationship, and it kinda pisses me off cuase i've had ten months of bad luck with the whole dating scene.  So me and kyle had a huge convo bout everything and anything. One of them convos that keeps ya interested (kyle and i are always interested with each other's lives) and that makes you learn alot about yourself or the other person.  He talked about his girlfriend, and how happy she makes him.  He's so scared of losing her and its amazing the bond they have. Sometimes I'm jealous because I want that connection with someone so bad, just like i'm kinda jealous of Edd and Claire. But at the same time, i'm just so happy for him.  THe way he talks about her.. god I just feel so enlightened cause he's so happy and in love and its so sickening at the same time (lol) but not really. I dunno if that makes sense, but it does to me.  i dunno what my life would be like without him, and that doenst necessarily mean like the whole ""i cant live without him"" complex, the whole ex who still loves her exboyfriend.. lol. its complete opposite of that. He's one of the bestest friends I've ever had, and I hope to have this friendship for a while. Like, I want my kids to know his kids and to call him uncle kinda friendship.. haha sounds freaky but its like.. a special bond that really nothing could come between it. We've been through so much shit since the first break up, God i cannot even start to recap half of it. But, for a while we stopped talking because it seems like he was jealous of me and all that.. and he freaked me out and i said fine i'm not talking to you for a few months.. two months later, we started talking again and I was so happy.  I love him to pieces. We're seriously so close, and when he talks about his girlfriend and how much he loves her it makes me so happy that he's found a perfect girl for him.  It made me cry. and thats a good cry.. I was just so blown away at all of it.
THen there's Claire. The present. She's like.. the best person on earth, and we've been through shit too. Like, I did stuff with her ex (and i feel rotten for it, It was totally stupid of me) and even though she was mad, she still stuck around wtih me. (of course, something like tha thas never happened before between me and anyone else, and it never will).  She's the girlfriend that i need to have, that moral support who understands the ""female point of view"".  *laughs* cause only a girl can understand how a girl feels. emotions are easy to relate to, but when you place those emotions within a perspective it seems so much clearer.  so, me and kyle's emotional bond is based on emotions, but we prolly could never see how it works inside each other's brain simply due to the fact that we're the opposite sex, yet, it gives us so much more insight on everything. Claire's in love. It's so wonderful. *sighs* i'm so happy for her as well. We can talk about anything, and we have like.. our guilty pleasure (adolfo and his car hahaha..) and all that. Its great to have that girl bond here (yeah she lives IN town) cause I need that to be real. Kyle and I are sane enough online, as well as keith.
Talking about Keith.. oh yes the infamous keith. Alex's keith some might say (he was that at one point). I havent spoken with Alex in a while, and maybe that could be a good thing, maybe not. Well, me and keith are real close. He's the ""soul-mate"" type best friend.. like dawson and Joey. (wow.. so pathetic to compare to, but yet so true) like.. I have this super huge bond with him thats so weird. Like he comes online and just says hey, I know what mood he's in. It's soooooo strange, and i cannot explain it. If he were here, i'm sure we'd have a romantic connection, but since he's not here, we dont wanna jump into a whole re-run of Joelle-Kyle episode witha  jumble of Alex-Keith episode. (thats like warping something completely nutso together) lol.. and it doesnt pain me to think ""oh yeah I cant have him"" cause i DO have him. insome weird sense, i do. Even if he found that perfect girl and married her, i mean it'd be a shame that i never had that try with him, but id stil have him. *laughs* seems kinda weird.
In other news, tomorrow (or rather later today) i have to practice flirting. Me and kyle determined that i have to learn to do ""selective"" flirting instead of ""be happy and friendly"" flirting (i'm currently on the latter mode)
Lets explain how this works:
I'm a very outgoing, easy going girl and I like to talk to people, get to know them. I've had friends ask me why I was flirting with someone, but I dont mean to flirt with them, it just comes off that way when I simply wanna meet someone. SO i have to learn how to de-program that, and go from ""be happy and friendly"" flirting to a ""selective"" flirting, the type of flirting that tells the guy you wanna flirt with that you're flirting with him without sending the wrong impression to the guy you're dying to get away from. So i have to go to the pool and practice.. lol.. 
BUt for now, my immediate future plans are to fall asleep and have a dream about my perfect guy that Kyle says i am going to meet soon. lol. Night."

"event","alrighty. so school has ended and another year has gone by. It seems all so strange cause everything is so messed up thsi year compared to the last. I remember grade 10 as being so happy and great.. and this year seems like all that kinda turned around and punched me in the face. I've realized how much people cannot be trusted as i thought so before, and i've made a handful of mistakes that can be seen as pretty stupid. I've learnt tho, and I've learnt to forgive others for their mistakes that have come onto me and hurt me directly or indirectly. Nobody's perfect.
This year has made me realize so many things, I'd say i've grown so much in just 9 months and it seems kinda crazy. Cadets is over, and so is school. Of course, there are those exams and all. 
Although, out of all this chaos that has happened this year, it seems like i have grown particularly stronger relationships with a few people. Claire and Keith and Kyle seem to be the only people I really trust anymore, but there are those other few people who i can talk to but not about anything.  Seems strange tho cause Keith and Kyle live so far away, but they are so close to me. 
Another thing i've realized this year is that I really dont take sex as seriously as i should. I'mgonna wait for the next guy that I think is right for me before I do that again. I dunno. I made some pretty stupid mistakes with all that this year, but its all in the past and there isnt much i can do about it. 
And religion. Religion is now important to me because I have finally made an educated decision about it.  I am not Religious, and do not believe in a God, but more believe that people should respect one another and forgive each other for their mistakes. Sounds pretty pathetic, but it actually works. I just think that Jesus was pretty smart to teach people that, and that its one of the best flints of advice I can take this year, especially after all that shit that happened between me and Sam and Emily. Me and Sam dont really talk anymore, and everyone absolutely hates her guts. I feel bad for her cause she kinda screwed herself over. As for em, we had a fight a while back and maybe i'll go over that one day soon.
Well i really should get going cause i have piano in ten minutes. Now that I have the summer, I think i'm going to be updating my journal much more. Yeah. Sounds like a plan"

"event","So its easter. Woke up this morning and went downstairs. Of course, I was excited to get up and do some present hunting. Ha.. Well, my mom and nana finally put the present in their hiding spots and I went a-searching. Of course, I turned on the computer this morning (am i not the only one in this house that spends like.. 24/7 on a computer??) and kyle is on AWAY! lol. He's like.. always online but never there and I hate it. Guess the thing that doesnt help is the fact that I havent talked to him since last sunday. (well I have but not that much.) So in other news, i was reading alex's lj yesterday and i was quite surprised. I mean.. I have known alex for a long time.. but i never really noticed that she is so.. Depressed.. Until recently. But yeah.. I guess since i dont really talk to her that much its kinda different.. But i'd like to help her out.. Ever since her and Keith broke up we havent really spoken. I talk to keith all the time, hey he's a great guy, and I mean.. we get along really well.  I just never realized how hurt he is by what she did. But whatever, its over and thats it. Wow.. sam just msged me.. But my name clearly states : If i dont respond you're prolly not worth it. Now she's prolly gonna give me hell. Its kinda hard to just look at that msg and ignore it.. cause she kinda just talks to me.. ooh man that is harsh..
She's typing.. help.. she's freaking typing typing typing.. jesus christ.. does this girl not understand that I do not want to speak to her??
aaaargh..
what the hell? she's like.. tlaking to me like i want to waste my time to talk to her..
Bleh.. she's gone. So.. life is alright apart from the few things that go on.. haha.. I get to keep the shoes... Those shoes that sam had and lent to me.. She said I could keep them.. yeah! well they're cute.. so whatever.
SOOO....... its easter/420.. haha.. what a combination.
2003.. what a great year."

"event","tomorrow if 4/20.. How interesting? lol. Today i'm quite bored.. but i've been having a great time lately. Firstly.. lets start in March.. Anabelle's birthday rolled by, we went to the restaurant (I work there now.) Then, the next weekend, (this is when me and Kyle were talking much more) I was talking to Kyle and he asked me if I wanted to go to Hawaii with him. I laughed at told him I couldn't (duh) and he said darn. His original plan was to go to Hawaii (this is his grad trip) with his gf Marina. He was pretty crazy bout her and always asked me what my advice would be. I gave him good advice too. It was nice to see him happy. We had been getting along quite well. Then, it all blew up in his face. She sent him the good 'ol ""I just want to be friends I dont want a bf"" letter (you gals know what that means) and he was bummed, asked me about it. Of course, i told him the truth and said that he certainly had no chance. (she totally lead him on!) So... we did notice that we've been talking much more than usual, and flirting much more than usual. Of course, I believed we had no chance of getting back together again. So we were discussing his grad trip.. Where should he go? And he had an idea. ""I'm gonna go to Calgary. I wanna see you."" Hmmmmm I bet you girls and boys know where this went. Later that night, he told me he knew we'd get back together this summer, and of course, I said ""hey.. why not get back now?"" and guess who's back together... Joelle and Kyle. The one biggest screw up couple ever (haha thats just cause everything that could basically possibly go wrong in a relationship tends to happen in ours.) There was a split reaction about it from people. Claire, of course, was ecstatic. She KNEW we'd get back together.. and it is great. I did miss him. But, of course, its weird at the same time. Cause I've spent all this time trying to get rid of the ""kyle and joelle"" complex for a bit. But its back. Plus, we have a bigger understand of the way we get when we're in a problem, and we also know each other much better than last time we started going out.  I miss him too, but he's gonna be here July 5th (hopefully). We're gonna go to the stampede together.. hahaha.. 
In other news..
spring is here. Its a beatiful 13 degrees C out there and its sunny! sunny sunny sunny. I got some spring/summer clothes and i cant wait to wear them.. haha.. Plus i got the coolest flip flops.  But yeah.. Tomorrow is 4/20 and its spring break.. Need i say more? Well easter is tomorrow as well.. hahaha.. pretty hilarious.  
Cadets.. ooh wow what an educational experience. I dont want to begin re-capping on that!  lets just say that there were nice rumours bout me.. like i'm sleeping with a f/sgt.. haha..that was january/february. just Guess who was spreading rumours about me.. Sam! yes.. the wonderful Sam, this girl at my school who used to be like one of my best friends. (we were really close.) And lets just say she pissed me off pretty bad..
Then.. everyone thought it would work out. She started acting nice to me and I went along with it. I seriously didnt want to cause my friends any more grief then we had already caused. We had a few fights here and there. then, a couple weeks ago, she got so pissed off at me cause of the whole shoe ordeal (i lent her a pair of shoes and she lent them to someone else. i tried to get them back but wasn't able to, and I got them back 8 months later and they're just shit.) and I told her she owed me money and she got all defensive. (w/e she's not worth the time to waste.) SOOOOOOOOOO she freaked out and said to emily and jess ""i'm never talking to her again"" and i heard about it.. and i was like.. SAWEET! i'm Free! seriously. she's that much a pain in the ass. I don't care who reads this.. she is. And, she also talked to kyle. I told him not to talk to her anymore. She freaking sent her picture to him.. skank.  Anywho.. She's telling everyone now that i'm going after my friend Graham Ring (he's a flight sergeant) and its like.. omg.. i just had a ride from him from cadets to get home one night.. so now i'm going after him? nuh uh. I've got kyle.  She's been making my life a living hell, and I dont want to complain about her elsewhere or to emily or people from school cause it is just too stupid. So i wanted to seal these feelings on here.  
As for friends from school... I feel so left out of the group. They all say i'm a slut and stuff.. Hey. I mean, we went to vancouver last weekend with band/choir and I was in a room with em and shana. So one night, marta came in our room cause vanessa was sick and she didnt want to sleep in her bed and get sick. We start talking bout my sex life and kyle. And i'm just like yeah so i've got experience.. big woop.. And they say i'm a skank. Hello? you don't say this to your friend. They said i am pretty easy to get to. What the fuck? I dont think they understand all that is going on in my life. I mean, there was this one guy.. and he pressured me into sex.. And I mean.. I'm not a skank just cuase i've done shit. Emily has cheated on how many bfs of hers? 3 i think.. First jason.. then julian.. then brad. like.. how much of a hypocrit can you get? I cheated on 1. And, i felt awful. I learnt from my mistake. They just make me feel horrible about myself. It isnt what a true friend does. 
Well.. I think thats enough of my life.. haha... 
Tomorrow i 4/20.. its easter as well. Many people will be in the ""sky"""

"event","Well.. this is my first entry in a bit.. I've been pretty busy with school and stuff. Apparently... someone used my diary... so i'm think of deleting that ""i am evil"" or whatever entry.. but i think its pretty funny. All my backgrounds got changed.. ahha but right now i dunno what i'm goign to do with my backgroudn......... ah well. SO lately.. i've just been chilling.. trying to get my life back in order after the whole janelle and josh thing.. that was pretty harsh. Actually, last weekend i talked to janelle on the phone.. I duno if that was wise to do, i doubt we'll be friends again, but i'm still worried bout her. I dont think she realy deserves to get all this shit from the people are our school, but i also think that she should simply stay away from my school for the time being. I dunnno its a pretty messed up subject... 

Also.. there's teh current problem i find that i'm having with my friends... Jess, Josh, Sam, Steph .... Just the people i see every day at school whom i consider close friends (sam and jess are up there) and there's Vanessa.. but there's nto much of a problem with her.. Josh is now dating this girl named steph.. and they are the cutest couple.. But Josh seems to have ""changed"" i dunno how.. he's not the old josh i used to know. I dunno, i dont think its really possible for someone to change.. there's just this phase he's going through that totally is strange.. I would be with jess and sam at phys ed.. and the josh would come along and they would run off with him, like i dont even exsit!!! so this makes me hang out with other people and i'm getting closer to marina, karisma, amanda.. Tghey are already  my friends and all, but I wasnt always close to them. SO yeah.. i dunno exactly whats happening with the whole josh thing. BLeh.. 

This weekend, i'm getting my hair cut! wahoo. I""ve already died it brown again, adn now i need a hair cut to change.. I havent had it cut in about......... 7 months now haha.. my hair's long now and i mean.. i like it long, but i dont have a style. i wanna get it layered and i wanna have sorta... bangs i suppose.. 

And finally.. teh whoel kyle thign. I dunno where the hell that is goign, but i think our chances of getting together again may be busted. I dunno what feelings i have for him, and vice versa.. but he has said some things lately that made me feel like he loved me, and other things that made me soo upset i wanted to hurt him so much. Its like.. some sort of paradox that doesnt make sense. I dunno if Freud was right when he said that sex is the root of all our problems.. maybe it is! Some sorta conspiracy aint it.
Bleh.. i guess thats all for now!"

I dunno why.. spent the whole day with alex tho. it was fun. went and saw josh and then leah.. *sighs* i think that was fine.. but now i just feel real awful. I changed my mind about dan. i kinda feel bad tho. cause i think he really liked me................................... bleh.. it took an hour and a half on bus to go to see josh way up north.. he doesnt seem himself.. his hugs were him but he was acting strange.. sorta like he's hiding feelings he wants out. hmm.. i dunno. he's gonna stay with the webbs and he seems way better now. He misses janelle and i heard janelle misses him. I think she did this to find a flaw in him and then she blamed it on me cause she thought i was going for josh.. I wasnt tho.. its really unfair. bleh i dunno what to expect from her anymore. she seems so drained. i'm just not talking to her anymore. sometimes i wish she would stay out of my business and not talk to me cause she asked me if i was pregnant.. and i really wanted to tell her to fuck off and that it wasnt any of her business.. *sighs* ah well"

The josh thing is that I think i'm falling for him.. yep.. my ex-best friends' ex bf.. hahah.. Well i dunno if he feels the same about me, but alex told me i have a fair chance with him.. i dunno..
The Kyle thing is that I might be pregnant. Who knows.. all i have to do now is wait and see if i am.. *sighs* my period is a few days over due, but then again, i'm still not regular, and the last couple periods i did have were late.. *sighs* well i think thats all for today.."

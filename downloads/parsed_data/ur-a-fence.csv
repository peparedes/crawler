"event","it's been awhile since the last time i updated. ive been reading back on all the past entries and ive changed so much, i feel like ive traveled more or like i have a better sense of who i am. i live in port shit hole yet i feel like the world is boundless to me. the past 4 years of my life have been total ups and downs. i started out in a house in port charlotte, went to the trailer, went to the condo, went to my sisters, back to the trailer, and this weekend to a house 2 miles away from the house i was born in.

in the past four years i have figured out what love is, what hate is, what a true last your whole life sittting at the kitchen table eating biscuts and gravy drinking sweet tea kind of friendship is, and just about everything in between.

but the best thing she said was

i will do anything for to make you happy ive been doing that since i was 12 years old, and do you think just because i have a kid of my own im just oing to stop. i love you and im just not that type of person.

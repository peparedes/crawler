Ladies, seriously, do take note of how you sit especially when you are wearing a dress/skirt that ends above your knees. Having a big bag to put on your lap doesn't mean that noone can see underneath your skirt. I have no wish to see your hot pink lacy thong or baby blue bikni panty peering at me throughout the train ride. And when you uncross your legs to shift into&nbsp;a more comfortable position, try not to flash your underwear. It's disgusting and disturbing.&nbsp;

Oh yes, even if you think your thighs are thick enough to cover, don't.&nbsp;It's a sight for sore eyes."

"event","I have not been updating much, while my memory is beginning to fail me (actually I'm just lazy)<br /><br />School has been ... normal. The usual boring lectures, laughing at the lecturers' articulation, longlong tutorials/seminars, gossiping etc.&nbsp;<br /><br />Late night bitching with the girls is always good. We played Joker (aka Old Maid/Donkey just that we used Jokers ... you get the drift) which was hilarious!&nbsp;A dosage a week is simply not enough anymore, but sadly, school is of existence.<br /><br />Wine tasting with Cassan at Bukit Timah. I finally found a place where no public toilets are available! Unless you happen to walk into one of the 2 shops that actually have a squatting toilet. (I don't do the squatting pee-ing thing) Anyhow, I got something for the dear! Hope he'll like it.<br /><br />Emos' bday dinner at Capers, The Regent Singapore. Some International Buffet dinner which tasted yummy, albeit a lil pricy. Burnt a lil hole in my pocket cos I treated Baby to it as well. So Emos I gave you 2 presents this year!!! You better not forget my flaming lambo. (:<br /><br />Loved the tiger prawns (I've always had a thing for prawns), the beef is slurps but depending on whether you prefer the well-done, or medium-well - and also your picking skills cos they are all mixed up. Lamb chop (which I saw Rodney puke out cos he couldn't stand the smell) was not too bad as well, if you are not as sensitive to the smell. Best of all, <strong>desserts</strong>!!! Bao and I just kept waiting for them to change<strong> sorbet</strong> flavours; we had strawberry, lemon and mango sorbet !! Yummy!!! And I tricked Bao into thinking that the mashed potato was lemon sorbet HAHA!! Fyi, the mashed potato is awesome! <br /><br />Baby and I went to catch the&nbsp;Pan's Labyrinth midnight show. It's this Spanish film similar to Narnia, but with a different concept. Held in 1944, it actually portrays the stark contrast in the harsh realities of life and the innocence of a little girl. It's nice, if you look deeper into it. If you're looking for a movie where you can just sit back and not work your mind (ala chick flicks) then don't watch it. Don't insult the show.&nbsp;"

"event","Hung out with cassan, xinyu and yiwen in town. Some of the things that crossed our topics of conversation:<br /><br />(1) Why are smoking areas so restricted? Like what yw said, people can only smoke outdoors. So if you don't like the smoke, go indoors! In an outlet, be it a cafe or coffeeshop, there are only less than 10 miserable tables assigned to smokers. If that's not bad enough, non-smokers have to take up the 'smoking' table! Hello weirdos??? I thought you <em>can't stand</em> the smoke?&nbsp;<br /><br />(2) In the whole of Orchard MRT, inclusive of underpass and area outside popular bookstore (that's already the second level), there is <strong>NOT a single dustbin to be found!!! </strong>If munching and drinking are not allowed in the premises of the MRT control station, <em>please </em>provide an effing dustbin!!&nbsp;<br /><br />(3) Oh, and mothers, please learn to control your kids. I know they are kids, some of whom can't even speak, but for crying out loud, educate them with some form of basic etiquette. Your kid likes to sit the swing? Fine! Bring him to a playground. Not let him sit on your lap and kick everyone around him - <em>ahem</em> that includes me! Not once, not twice, but so many times! And what does the mother do? NOTHING! But let the kid continue disrupting the peace in the train!&nbsp;<br /><br />(4) Something linked to (3), Yiwen mentioned an incident with her neighbours. Seriously, parents nowadays <strong>do not control their kids.</strong> They pamper them too much, let them do whatever they want, to the point of them being a social pest! Yes, I used the word pest, which imo, is very very kind. And people actually wonder why teenagers/youths are so ill-mannered and disrespectful. Because they have such parents!&nbsp;<br /><br />Gosh. Society norms are just a piece of crap. On one hand, they wince at modernism, at women who are more daring to dress (not skanky of course, just those more fashionable. I assume you&nbsp;are a wise, fashionable reader who can tell the difference) but they accept uncouth&nbsp;behavior.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyhoos,&nbsp;time for dinner ...&nbsp;"

We didn't realise it was R21 till baby told me that there will be a guy at the door checking identification! <em>panic attack</em> Luckily there was a group of young-looking ppl in front of us who had their i/cs checked. So I ""snuck"" in with them (:<br /><br />If you thought Saw II was gory, this is worse!!! Saw I was nothing; Saw II had a lil more bloody scenes. Saw III was filled with it! Initially, I kept gripping baby because it was so painful - painful for the victim, such that looking at him suffer made watching him feel painful.

"event","<p>Fab&nbsp;dinner with baby (:&nbsp;<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief (and I think it is rather well-known) I was early today! Like 40 minutes early heh. Jason got quite&nbsp;a shock but he was already in town. (suspicious suspicious) He was acting not-so-normally so I got kinda wary. And he kept saying that I was interrogating him (which in a way is true).&nbsp;Told me soooo many tall tales but it was all to surprise me (:&nbsp;<br /><br />Brought&nbsp;me to Dan Ryan's for dinner. Great food with huge portions. Seriously, it was special and delicious, which totally offsets the price. Plus, the service is very good. Wouldn't mind going back for more!&nbsp;<br /><br />I was happily munching on my Seafood Penne with Cheese Sause (or the likes) when I was suddenly greeted by the restaurant staff holding a Molten Choc Cake (slurps) and a present from baby. I felt quite embarrassed actually, shock but embarrassed - in a good way of course.&nbsp; <br /><br />So yeah, that was why he was in town so early.&nbsp;<br /><br />Present? A Coach wallet !!! Not the Hamptons series that I ohsolove, but a new collection which is similar to one of them. Very nice!!! Brownish&nbsp;and ohsogorgeous.&nbsp;My cable is screwed up, so I'll upload the photos another time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Meanwhile, I shall&nbsp;bask in the remaining 3 hours and 15 mins of my 19 y.o life</p>"

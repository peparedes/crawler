Yeah, that's totally not me!!

I woke up this morning, had a shower, looked at my hair and thought, ""I need a change!""
BAM!
Two hours later I have baby bangs again.
lol
They look great, and they definatly change the look of my hair.
Speaking of which, I've seriously become really low maintenance when it comes to my hair.  I wash it every two days, and basically don't do anything to it, except put a little straightening cream in it.  

No blow drying, no straightening, nothing.
And my hair looks GREAT!!!


Everyone has been commenting today on how beautiful it is today, and I'm going to add to that by saying...
DAMN we are lucky to live where we do!!
Both of the times on my bus rides yesterday, as we were crossing over the Johnson St. bridge, I looked over the water and thought to myself... WOW!!!!
Especially on the way home, when the sun had just set and the sky over the water was pink.
Beautiful!

Working at 3:30 to 8:30 today.
So far this is my 5th day in a row working, which is odd.. haha
But i've banked about 32 hours this week.
Tomorrow is my mum's birthday.  They are taking me to a hockey game.  w00t!!
I have to clean tomorrow since i have friday and saturday off!

Needless to say I'm not answering my phone if work calls ;P

OHHHHHHH did I mention I got a job at Starbucks!!
That's right.
As of next week I'm a barista at the Starbucks in the Save On plaza in Vic. West!!!

I have a cold.
Almost gone through an entire tissue box in three days.  Had to remove all the toxic waste from the garbage cans around my place today, and keep it contained to one bag, which i take with me everywhere I go.. haha.
I have to say though, that this is the first time I've had a head cold since, I can't even remember.  Which is really good, because last year, especially at the beginning, I was sick ALL THE TIME.  Which of course I blame on too much partying, lack of sleep, and eating terribly, which have all but banished this year.  I'm really trying to take care of myself this year.  I don't want to drink too much (although that doesn't mean NEVER! heh), I want to get lots of sleep, and I want to eat really well.  
So far so good, except for being sick, and not sleeping well last night because of the stupid wind storm.  But I'm really trying to eat better, adding more vegetable and fruit into my diet, and less crap.  Also, because of being so cash strapped, I'm not eating out as often or spending as much money on useless crap, which I'm really proud of myself for doing so far.
I still have my spending moments, but really who doesn't?

Speaking of money, I'm hoping to have that problem fixed soon, although I haven't heard anything yet, and sort expected too.  Well I guess we'll see.

p.s.
I just fell in love with Peppermint tea <3<3"

Seriously, you can't let the fact that your scared hold you back from traveling by yourself, I was really scared when I left home, but I knew I had to overcome it, or else I would never do anything.
I'm so glad I went by myself, and I know that next time I will be able to go with someone and have another totally different experience.

On another note, I emailed this guy Joe that I met in Nice.  He was there for two days, before heading to Italy, but he was the coolest guy.  Bridget and Eric will remember him.  Anyway, got an email back,which is exciting and I'm hoping we can stay in contact :D

There are also a lot of other people I want to email and keep in contact with, that I met on my trip.

:D

I just got back from a Bulldogs game.  OMG the fans in Port Alberni are CRAZY about there hockey team.. It was so cool to be in the stands.  They played the Nanaimo Clippers, which is apparently the team they hate, so it was a sold out game.  
Port kicked Nanaimo's ASS!!!!!!!!
lol
Fun... except getting hit on by the creepy guy sitting next to me and various other ""older"" men *shudders*

Anyways, taking the bus back to Vic tomorrow.
Give me a good chance to finish my book."

I think that just explains last weekend entirely.
So yeah, here we are entering another weekend.  November is going by so quickly, it's so odd.  

Okay, remember how my whole trip was basically to find myself, and figure out what I wanted to do next??
(I know that sounds cheezy)
Well I figured it out, and I'm in the process of applying to UVIC for next September!
I'm super stoked!

I've never been so excited at the fact of going to school, but I think it's a huge step for me, and I plan to have my second career by the time I'm 30!
So many changes this year, especially in me.
Those four months changed me for the better, and I would never want them taken away.

"event","I'm having a bad week.
I'm really lonely.

Every night this week, (besides tonight) I've spent the evening at home, alone with Macavity.  I'm sick of it.  
I love my friends to death, but they can't be with me all the time.  They have boyfriends of their own, but I don't.
I'm sorta jealous of them.  
I use to be the only one who was never single, and now I seem to be the only one who is.
I don't like it, but there is nothing I can do about it.
I don't wanna date anyone I know, or my friends know, cuz that just makes an awkward situation if it doesn't work out, and I don't need any more awkwardness in my life.
The girls tonight were trying to think of guys I could date, but again, they were all people they knew or were friends with.

I'm being too picky.  A date is just a date.
I guess I want more than that, but I can't just instantly have a boyfriend, it doesn't work like that.
BAH!

I'm sad.. to put it simply."

w00t!
Just finished watching Ghostbusters with Sarah.
A good way to end an awesome weekend.

Friday, I made lovely chocolate cupcakes with pink icing.  My parent's came down and the three of us went to the Victoria Salsa vs. Alberni Bulldogs game.  It was fun.  The Bulldogs kicked the Salsa's ass!!!!!!
Worked Saturday, than Andrea, Sarah and I all headed to Lisa's house for the girly sleepover.
I haven't had so much fun just hanging out with girls in a long time, and especially the LOVELY ones I hung out with last night <3.  
I drank my entire bottle of wine, ate pizza, cupcakes, candy, popcorn.  We talked, played with the most ADORABLE babies, tried to play ""Nightmare"", watched part of a movie before all of us passed out in the middle of Lisa's living room (you can see Jaime passed out WAY before us, documented by Jenn).  I woke up to the cat playing with my feet, and than proceeding to sniff my nose.. hehe Basil is so cute.

In the morning we ate Timmy Ho's and watched Mermaids.

I think we laughed an amazing amount.
It was great!

Thank you Lisa for hosting us all, and putting up with us even though you were sick <3.  I owe you money for the food!

Next girls night, at my house!!!"

After that, Christoph was appointed to make sure that no one came near me with out a ""Jen card"".
And that guy was kicked out of the bar.

If I had a boyfriend, those things wouldn't happen... meh.. oh well.

Yesterday was a really fun day.
My parent's arrived and we went for lunch.  Than my dad and I joined Amalia and her mom for a walk on Dallas Road.  After, me and Amalia made dinner (well I was allowed to prep a few things) for my parents.  It was so yummy!!!!!!!!! MMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......

Than we all went to see Wallace and Gromit; The Curse of the Were Rabbit, which my parent's paid for both me and Amalia.  Which was REALLY nice of them. <3  Thank you!

"event","I had the strangest dream last night.  So strange that I can still remember it now.  
I slept with this guy, only to find out that he had a girlfriend, and that his girlfriend was one of MY friends from Port Alberni (well an aquantence).  Than after learning this fact, I proceeded to have sex with him again!  Than for some reason, I was cuddling up with Nick Stokes from CSI!!!!

I woke up after that.

I think the reason I had sex and affairs on the brain was because I watched Sex and the City earlier in the evening.  You know the episode where Carrie cheats on Aiden TWICE with Mr. Big.  

Weird.

Anywho, So i've decided i'm going to take the job at the Gap.  32 hours guaranteed a week, $10 perhour starting wage, 30% discount on clothing (and %50 once a month).  If I am really strapped for cash I can always find another part time, but for now this is good for me, since I haven't worked in about 5 months.  

Well at least I won't half to worry about spending insane amounts on clothing... hehe

So yeah..
It's raining..
I like it!

<3
:D"

"event","And plans are brewing!!!
*gets giddy*

Amalia and I are doing research as we speak.  Tomorrow I think we should go get ideas from some costume shops, and I need to find out how to hide and redraw eyebrows.  I know the Kevyn Aucoin shows you how in his book, so I will have to go to Chapter's and write down his directions.  
Why, you ask do we need to do this?
Because we need to have pencil thin eyebrows, and none of use REALLY wanna tweeze our eyebrows like that.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh so excited!

I heart Halloween!"

"event","Alright, so I haven't heard back from the Gap yet.  I have no idea what is going on.  I got the job, they told me that, but they told me they'd be calling me back to let me know when I was starting etc.  I thought this would be right away, but apparently not.  I thought I might be working by now.  Bah... I think if I don't hear anything by tomorrow, I'm going to call them.

I had a really great weekend.  Awesome dinner made by the Amalia on friday night.  Saturday night was drunken festivities with Amalia, Sarah, Andrea and Eric.  Yesterday was laziness with Eric and than he made me this awesome dinner of steak, salad and asparagas.  Except I didn't get to eat much of it cuz I STUBBED MY BABY TOE!!!!  Oh I do this often, but not this bad.  
I seriously thought it was broken, it hurt so much to do anything.  We phoned a medical help line and the nurse gave me some suggestions and told me if the pain was worse or the same in 24hours I should go see my doctor.  
So for the rest of the night I was stuck on the couch, with ice on my toe for a while, and everytime I had to pee, Eric had to be my crutch so I'd hop along to the toilet.  It was quite funny.  Thank goodness he was there to help me out in my crippled state. <3

Today, my toe is a bit better, still a little sore, can't quite walk without limping yet, but I'm trying not to do TOO much today, so that my toe heals fast.  Especially since walking and standing is a huge part of my NEW job.. if I ever start it that is :P

Alright, I'm going to limp off to have a shower.. haha  I'm hoping that I can get out of the house this evening.. maybe is someone interested in doing something???  That doesn't involve walking.. lol

Okay.. off to shower!"

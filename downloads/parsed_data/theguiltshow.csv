"event","So I haven&#39;t (publicly) written here in the longest time. I remember the days when it was routine for me to come home, sit down in front of my laptop and chronicle my day and thoughts in a blog entry. That was ruined by the rise of Twitter and micro-blogging, which reduced lengthy and thoughtful blog entries to 140-character-long blurbs. Then along came Instagram, which reduced blurbs about thoughts and feelings to pictures and captions, only posted on special events. And now, it&#39;s Snapchat, random 10-second captures of our days, which disappear in 24 hours. Our attention spans are getting shorter and shorter. Not that I&#39;m fucking deep or anything, I can&#39;t even be bothered much with any of my social media platforms anymore. LOL social media just reminds me of the whole Essena O&#39;Neill thing. As if she &quot;exposed&quot; things about social media that were unknown??? Don&#39;t even get me started *eye roll*

Now I can&#39;t even remember why I clicked on &#39;post an entry&#39; in the first place. I&#39;m rambling. My Livejournal is basically just random shit for me to read years down the road. I read old blog entries and I&#39;m like nah, can&#39;t relate. Who was I??? What was all this crap about ~love~ and shit? What kind of weakling wrote all this drivel???

My stomach won&#39;t shut up. I&#39;m not even hungry. Okay I&#39;ll be back to write an actual update about my life so that I and I alone can read it five years down the road and scoff at how naive I was back in 2015. Goodbye!"

"event","<p>Okay I&#39;m aware this is fucking stupid but I really get way too many repeated questions because people are either too lazy to scroll or the answers are buried underneath hundreds of others, so here goes! Will update this accordingly.

<b>1. How old are you?</b>
I was born on 21 February 1991, so as of 2016, I&#39;m 25.

<b>2. Where are you studying/where have you studied?</b>
I went to primary school at CHIJ Kellock, secondary school at Crescent Girls&#39; School, JC for a year at St Andrew&#39;s Junior College, then I did Mass Communication at Ngee Ann Poly, before coming here to the UK to study philosophy at Durham University.

<b>3. Why did you leave JC?</b>
I didn&#39;t feel that what I was studying was relevant to what I wanted to do in the future (marketing/PR), so I left to do mass comm.

<b>4. Why theguiltshow?</b>
Guilt Show is an album by The Get Up Kids. I really liked them when I was 14, still do.

<b>5. What is your Instagram/Twitter/YouTube/tumblr/whatever else?</b>
Everything is theguiltshow except for YouTube: sophisticatedsavage.

<b>6. How tall/heavy are you?</b>
1.7m, 52-55kg on average (I think, haven&#39;t weighed myself in a while).

<b>7. What is your sexual orientation?</b>
I am a full on lesbian. I don&#39;t find guys attractive.

<b>8. When did you know you were gay?</b>
Aside from early encounters and experimentation, the very first at age 9, the first time I was fully aware of my feelings for a girl and recognised that as being gay was when I was 13.

<b>9. What is your clothing/shoe/bra size?</b>
UK 8 for clothes, US9/euro 40 for shoes and 34DD.

<b>10. Do you have any siblings?</b>
I have a sister who is three years younger than I am.

<b>11. *insert question asking something along the lines of I am confused am I gay or straight I like looking at pretty girls blah blah*</b>
Take it easy, no one is forcing you to choose a label. You never have to if you don&#39;t want to or if you can&#39;t figure it out. Just go with the flow and do what makes you happy or what feels good, as long as you&#39;re not hurting anybody. Stop stressing out, it&#39;s not a big deal.</p><p><b>12. Are you a virgin?</b>
L O L. Virginity is a social construct which I do not subscribe to.

<b>13. *insert question seeking advice re: anything to do with love, friends, etc*</b>
I am the world&#39;s worst person to go to for advice right now because I really have no patience for emotions of any sort. My advice to you will always be: just don&#39;t give a fuck, it&#39;s easy. Just do what makes you happy. Life&#39;s too short to give a shit. Stop worrying. It&#39;s your life, live it the way you want to. I don&#39;t really understand or have the patience for anyone who can&#39;t feel the same way so if you don&#39;t or can&#39;t feel this way, I&#39;m really not someone you should be going to for advice.

<b>14. MBTI/enneagram type?</b>
MBTI: ESTP
Enneagram: 7w8 sp or 8w7 sx</p>"

If I do, I will truly no longer know love. My heart has become incapable of feeling or giving love. Do I even have a heart?

I know you are very happy too, and that is how I know leaving us behind was the right thing to do. I have grown so much as a person, and I have found my own way and my own happiness, all by myself. Perhaps the only thing that (ironically) bugs me is the almost complete inability to care about anything anymore. Maybe that&#39;s a good thing, since I feel nothing but happiness.</span>

I was sure to tell you every single day how much I loved you, I made sure of that. Maybe somewhere inside me I knew this would end someday, and I had hoped that you would walk away knowing that. I loved you with everything that I had, and I can say with all my heart that I am content; I have no regrets.</span>

The weather has been hovering around 20 degrees lately, beautiful but actually hot. Thank goodness I bought a fan on Amazon a while back. I was starting to think that I wouldn&#39;t have any use for it because it was still chilly (under 15 degrees), but in the last week the weather has really turned. Loving the sun, though. People have actually been sitting outdoors and studying in the sun. That&#39;s all so new to me because in Singapore, the only reason you&#39;d be out in the sun STUDYING is because your mind is no more. Had my first paper yesterday, it went okay. One down, four more to go! After they&#39;re over, I still have a 4000 word essay to hand in, so... ACK I can&#39;t wait for freedom.

Wish me luck!&nbsp;"

"event","My exams are in four days and I feel like I barely know anything about my modules. Kind of sort of really panicking now. I&#39;ve been studying but it hasn&#39;t been the hyper-focused, efficient kind of studying I know myself to be capable of. Maybe it&#39;s because I study on my bed...

Just placed an order for bikinis on ASOS. I am so excited for New York and Orlando in summer. I&#39;ve never been to America nor had any real desire to, but after talking about it and planning the itinerary (especially for Orlando - Universal/Magic Kingdom/Wet &#39;n&#39; Wild!) I became so psyched. Tickets have already been booked! 

I&#39;ve also been thinking about friendships and just life in general. I feel like my friendships back when I was a teenager were more... Authentic. I&#39;m not in any way implying that I&#39;m friends with fake and superficial people (because I&#39;m not) but I definitely shared more of myself back then. I also feel like people shared a lot more with me. I feel like I hardly know anyone, but when I really think about it, I don&#39;t think anyone really knows me either. I realise I share so much less of what I feel, what&#39;s going on in my life, what I&#39;m doing, etc. I remember being in Crescent and going to school all excited every day because I had something really important to tell my friends. Being in the same class sure helped, I guess. A few months ago I decided to play a more active part in my friendships and talk to my loved ones more (seeing as how I have a tendency to not reply texts and worse - withdraw into myself for days) but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s making a difference. I think I&#39;ve a better word for my friendships in the past: emotional. I cared more, I shared more, cried more, said more, needed more, gave more. Maybe it&#39;s just me growing up. Or becoming emotionless. Or more independent? I&#39;m not sure what it is but I do know that tonight I miss my past and I can&#39;t wait to go back in Singapore in July and be reunited with everyone I love and miss.

Alright, back to Hume. Signing off now (how my mom ends her texts)."

So the question is: what&#39;s been happening in my life lately? To be honest, I haven&#39;t felt much motivation to blog for a while now, feel like I might abandon this space altogether... And yet I am hesitant to do so, because I&#39;ve had this Livejournal since 2006, and it&#39;s got all of my favourite memories, both happy and sad, in it. I will persevere.

In a way not much has happened, and yet it would seem that I would have a lot to say since moving to England; it being such a big change in my life. Perhaps I should first blog about my trip back home recently.


<b><u>Easter break</u></b>

Came back from a three week trip back to Singapore two weeks ago. It&#39;s always good to be home. Before I left Singapore and moved here, I was so excited to leave the place I had grown up in and gotten bored of. A year ago, I would have died for the chance to leave boring, stuffy, hot Singapore to go anywhere and do anything a plane ride away. I&#39;m not regretting my decision to study overseas at all, but it has given me a new appreciation and love for my home country. I mean, where else can you go out at 3am and have a nice steaming hot bowl of bak kut teh? All the shops here close at 5pm and god forbid I find any bak kut teh. The lack of food&#39;s actually been the hardest part of living abroad. Anyway my trip back this time was a surprise one, only my sister knew I was going back. I just snuck into my house with my suitcase and surprised my parents. My mom said she knew something was up. I guess moms really do know best! Their reactions were so cute and heartwarming. I&#39;ve missed them in all their occasional parent annoying-ness. Finally got to cuddle my beloved Omelette again. I have plans to maybe move out to a place of my own when I go back to Singapore (if I go back), I can&#39;t wait to take him along with me.

Spent my three weeks meeting up with friends (although not as many and as often as I would have liked), clubbing, drinking, EATING, sleeping, eating... God I got so fat. I ballooned in the first week I got back. My favourite part of this trip was not telling anyone I was coming back and then surprising them one by one. Their reactions were gold.

Surprised my parents first, then Evia, by getting Grace to ask her to come down from her office to collect something I passed to her. She jumped back and refused to hug me. GREAT FRIEND. Then Del, who came later. Next was Nicole, at Tantric. She yelled and yelled and asked me what I was doing there. And then that night I posted pictures on Instagram so the big secret was out hahaha loved the shocked texts. Maybe I should come back secretly all the time!<div style=""text-align: center;"">

"event","<div>In case some of you haven&#39;t heard, recently the Health Promotion Board published an<a href=""http://www.hpb.gov.sg/HOPPortal/health-article/HPB056342""> informative and unbiased FAQ</a> regarding sexuality. Under pressure by a certain group of individuals who felt that it was &quot;pro-LGBT&quot; and anti-family, HPB amended its FAQ and removed the link to Oogachaga, an LGBT support group, under its &quot;Where can my child find support in Singapore?&quot; section. There is currently a petition going around to review the entire FAQ. Some of you may know a pastor Lawrence Khong, who is the chairman of LoveSingapore, a network of churches in Singapore. <a href=""http://mypaper.sg/opinion/hpbs-sexuality-faqs-undermine-family-20140206"">He wrote a response to HPB&#39;s FAQs on sexuality</a>.

I&#39;m still in disbelief that such a disgusting and ignorant article was written by a Singaporean. How is this backward mindset still existing in such a technologically and economically advanced country such as Singapore? My brain just can&#39;t process what I&#39;ve just read.
</div><br><br><div><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">Dear Lawrence Khong,</span></div>

<div><b>Issue 1:</b></div><div>If a relationship in which it is impossible to procreate is &quot;abnormal&quot; and &quot;unnatural&quot;, then why are infertile men and women allowed to get into relationships without anyone kicking up a big fuss? We are considered different from other animals because we have the ability to reason, so why is the argument against homosexuality the lack of ability to procreate, as though our sole purpose is to do just that? &quot;Moral objection is based on the intrinsic physiological nature of the male and female bodies.&quot; Tell that to the tens of thousands of people who are biologically incapable of procreating. I have raised this issue multiple times with people who support your argument, but have never received a satisfactory response, or even a response at all.</div><div>I also take issue with your implication that the law sets the standard for what is moral or immoral. The law doesn&#39;t allow the import of chewing gum. Would you consider that immoral, Pastor Khong?</div><div>

<b>Issue 2:</b></div><div>Do you know what is &quot;unjust and harmful&quot;? Asking the Health Promotion Board &nbsp;to include &quot;avenues of care&quot; like <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Liberty-League-SG/164309513732302"">Liberty League</a>. Browsing through their Facebook page brought up things like &quot;sexuality gone wrong&quot; and &quot;sexual brokenness&quot;. Pray tell, why would you want a confused and maybe helpless young person to call an organisation which would only serve to make them feel worse about themselves? How is it helpful or beneficial to anyone to have these people call a hotline only to be told that they are sinning, or rejects, or morally wrong? Do you not worry that some of these people may hurt themselves even further emotionally by rejecting and repressing themselves, or maybe even take their own lives? Suicide rates are highest among LGBT individuals, and you want to continue to essentially tell them that they are horrible people? Now that is &quot;unjust and harmful&quot;.</div>

<div><b>Issue 3:</b></div><div>Oh, I&#39;m sorry that the word &quot;homophobia&quot; is &quot;misleading and highly offensive&quot; to you. Gay people have only been called much worse names, been bullied and made fun of their entire lives, many to the point that they have chosen to take their own lives, instead of suffer any more rejection. It breaks my heart that many have chosen this path because of societal rejection. I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m sorry that the use of the word &quot;homophobia&quot; has simply rubbed you the wrong way, though. What is your mild annoyance compared to the decades of repression, bullying and hate crimes suffered by the LGBT community?</div><div>&quot;We do not despise homosexuals or hold them in contempt. We esteem them as fellow human beings of intrinsic worth. Each one is precious, deserving respect and love, just like anyone else.&quot; Now you&#39;re just being condescending, Pastor Khong. If homosexuals are what you claim, why are you trying so hard to reject them, change them and repress them? If you respect and love someone, you don&#39;t make them suffer. You try to understand and accept them, even if it takes time.</div><div>

<b>Issue 4:</b></div><div>Cite your sources. Do you mean <a href=""http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/faculty_sites/rainbow/html/facts_cameron_obit.html"">Paul Cameron&#39;s The Lifespan of Homosexuals</a>? One only has to glance through the &quot;research methodology&quot; to see what is gravely flawed in this &quot;study&quot;.</div>

<div><b>Issue 5:</b></div><div>&quot;An unproven assertion that homosexuals can have long-lasting relationships&quot;? What do you mean by long-lasting? Twenty years? Ten? Five? It only takes a simple Google search to bring up many examples of loving homosexual partners that have been together for decades. I am also interested to see what your sources are, because you haven&#39;t cited a single source for all your sweeping statements.</div><div>

-</div>

<div>You place so much emphasis on family and the family unit. I&#39;m assuming this means a father, a mother, and child(ren). You are a pastor, practising a religion that promotes love and acceptance. How can it be that this loving and accepting religion is so excluding of different family units (as you have implied about your religion and its values)? What about single mothers who have to bring their children up alone? Or children brought up by grandparents or aunts and uncles? They do not form traditional family units either, but I am sure that you would not reject or even say anything about these families, because what are they doing wrong, really?</div><br><br><div>The kind of Singapore I want, and I am sure many others want, is a diverse, accepting, loving and overall happy nation. Not a draconian and authoritative nation which tells its citizens who we can or cannot love. If you love this nation so much, then stop rejecting its citizens. Make a positive change and start spreading love and acceptance instead of hate and ignorance.

I already blogged about graduation, but thought I&#39;d say a few more words just for this blog post. It was an incredible three year long journey in Ngee Ann Mass Comm, and I&#39;m grateful every day that I chose that path and met the people that I did. I learned many things, academic and personal, and would gladly relive my three years, if given the chance. It&#39;s just so hard to believe that my three years there have already come to a close, because it was all I knew, lived, ate, and breathed for such a long time.</div><div>

<span style=""text-align: center; line-height: 1.4;"">Probably the biggest thing that&#39;s ever happened to me. Before I came here to study, I&#39;d never even been to England before. It&#39;s been about three months of my living there, and I love it so much. The weather, Durham... Of course there are things I miss about being home: like my friends, family, my rabbits, the convenience, the clubbing (Zouk), the food(!!!)... I&#39;ve been back in Singapore for a few weeks now and it seems like nothing has changed. Although I have been very ill all throughout Christmas and now New Year&#39;s, so that hasn&#39;t been much fun at all. I&#39;ve been downright miserable. However, I&#39;ve had a smashing 2013, so I guess this is a small price to pay. Some pictures of Durham:</span>

And of course, in between these milestones, I had a fantastic time with everyone I love. I&#39;m very grateful to the friends who&#39;ve stayed, the friends I grew closer to this year, and the friends I only started talking to this year. 2013 was beautiful and amazing and so colourful. I had the time of my life this year. I must say that this was a year of few tears as well. I&#39;ve been really happy and fulfilled up to this point. Although 2013 is ending and 2014 is beginning in poor health for me, I can safely say that I&#39;m truly appreciative for all the good things and people that have come my way, and I hope that 2014 will be just as good to me. After all, it is what you make of it.</div>"

"event","I&#39;ve been off for a while now, ever since I fell sick with a high fever about three weeks ago. My appetite has diminished (and if you know me you would know how big it is), I get frequent migraines, nausea, fatigue, and I even got vertigo the other day. I&#39;ve been skipping classes and keeping to myself a lot. All I feel like doing is sleeping and staying in.&nbsp;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with me :&#39;(

I&#39;ll probably go to the doctor later or something. I&#39;m so goddamn tired and sick all the time. 

Enough about my physical state.

It&#39;s getting really cold here in Durham! When I first arrived in late September it was 15-18 degrees Celsius, and now it&#39;s 1-5 degrees. Amazon has been my best friend, I get everything (especially winter essentials) off there. Currently shopping for ear muffs and a rain coat, because it does rain pretty often here. I&#39;m really happy that it doesn&#39;t storm though, because as you might already know, I&#39;m deathly afraid of thunderstorms. I haven&#39;t experienced a single storm since I got here!! Amazing. 

Okay I&#39;m really tired now. Will go lie down before my next class at 4pm. Ciao!"

Hello from Durham! I know, I know. I&#39;ve completely neglected this space. I&#39;ll do an update on my life here soon, but for now, let me finish part two of my Phuket post! (For my ask.fm anons :p)
<div style=""text-align: center;"">

<b><u>Day 3: Sunday, 25 August</u></b>

We got up bright and early (at 6am) to get ready for our island hopping tour! The bus came to pick us up from our hotel at 7am, and we slept through the journey to the ferry terminal. So we boarded this ferry along with many other tourists, and off we went!

Our first stop was Khai Nok Island, for some snorkelling and chilling. Because it wasn&#39;t accessible directly via the ferry, we had to get off the ferry and onto a long-tail boat.

<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr171/sarahyip/Photobucket%20Desktop%20-%20Sarahs%20MacBook%20Pro/phuket%20part%202/P1040038.jpg~original"" title="""" />

Rows and rows of colourful beach chairs and umbrellas, which you could rent for like 150baht I think? And yes that&#39;s a butch and her girlfriend, from China. I thought she was cute HAHAHA

Check out the colour of the sand and the water :&#39;)

Okay so we tried to snorkle, but the waves were just too strong and there were just too many people, so we bought bread and ended up feeding the fish instead. They would just swim right up to you in schools, too cute! After about an hour or so, we got back on the boat and headed back to the ferry, where they served lunch in cute Japanese bento boxes.

<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr171/sarahyip/Photobucket%20Desktop%20-%20Sarahs%20MacBook%20Pro/phuket%20part%202/P1040067.jpg~original"" title="""" />

Then we went to some bay for snorkelling! We all got off the ferry and snorkelled in the clear waters. I can&#39;t swim, so I was kind of petrified for the first 15 minutes. I clung on to Grace for dear life, until finally the people on the ferry saw how much I was freaking out, and threw me a float HAHAHA. After that Grace taught me how to breathe through the snorkelling mask, and held my hand throughout. I calmed down, and had an amazing time snorkelling for the first time ever! We saw swordfish and all sorts of other colourful fish :) I really loved it.

Next stop: Phi Phi Island. I&#39;d heard a lot about how it was a huge tourist trap, so I wasn&#39;t expecting much.

<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr171/sarahyip/Photobucket%20Desktop%20-%20Sarahs%20MacBook%20Pro/phuket%20part%202/P1040072.jpg~original"" title="""" />

I was right not to expect much, most of the island consisted of stalls (which I wasn&#39;t interested in)

Explored for a little while, then we went back to the ferry, which concluded our island tour. I think I enjoyed the journey back the most, it took over an hour to get back, and we just laid on the top deck, soaking up the sun. I fell asleep on Grace&#39;s lap because the sound of the waves, the sun, the incredible breeze, and the sea spray were just all so relaxing :&#39;) That was the most amazing nap.

Got back to our room in time for the sunset :)

That night, we got dressed up and went out for a dinner date at a restaurant called Karlsson&#39;s, which was apparently really good for its steak and Swedish food.

Naturally, along the streets, there were so many people advertising their bars, clubs, etc. There were also people carrying these:

AHHHHH!!!!


It had little fingernails and cute little hands which would so cutely grab onto your arm or anything else on you omfg and these amazing huge, sad, wet eyes that would BEG you to take it home. Omfg I&#39;ve never seen anything so cute before. It was 100baht (SGD4) to take pictures with one, and I spent SGD12 taking photos with several HAHAHA. I wanted to cry from all the cuteness. Grace bought me a rose off a street vendor (awwww) and I presented it to a slow loris, whose eyes widened in an almost crazy manner, then it slowly started moving towards it, its arms outstretched, and BAM! It suddenly grabbed my rose and tore off some petals and started eating them omfg cutest thing I&#39;ve EVER SEEN. HAHAHAHAHAHHA.

We ended up having drinks and talking to one of the dancers. When we asked her to give Grace a lap dance, she was so hesitant and refused to because she said if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn&#39;t want other girls to dance on him and she didn&#39;t want us to fight HAHAHAHA awww :p Also Thai girls seem to really like my boobs, they kept complimenting them and touching them HAHA.

We had some beer and tequila and headed back. Spent the whole day out at sea, so we were pretty beat!

<b><u>Day 4: Monday, 26 August</u></b>

Woke up early again for horseback riding! A car came to pick us up and drove us to the place. I was really excited because when I rode on a horse for the first time when I was 11, I had such a good experience and I&#39;ve always wanted to get back on a horse since!

It was blazing hot that day :( we rode for about an hour and it was really fun! Maybe I should join the equestrian club here... Hmm.

Anyway, we went back to our hotel. I had the most torturous ride back EVER. About 5-10 minutes into the 30 minute journey, I needed to pee really badly. I&#39;m pretty good at holding my pee, but prior to the journey I had finished an entire cold coconut, and stupidly decided that I didn&#39;t need to visit the bathroom. So when I say I needed to pee, I mean I NEEDED TO PEE. I WAS ON THE VERGE OF PEEING IN MY PANTS. I was in actual physical pain from holding my pee in. The driver didn&#39;t really understand English, so we couldn&#39;t get him to stop and let me pee somewhere else. Also, we travelled with another couple, so I didn&#39;t want to inconvenience everyone. Eventually, I reached the point where I didn&#39;t give a fuck anymore, I just needed to pee. I ended up typing &quot;I need to pee can you drop me somewhere&quot; into my Google Translate app, and showed it to the driver. All he kept saying was &quot;no toilet, no toilet&quot; I WAS FUCKING DYING. After 20 minutes of digging my nails into my arm to keep myself from pissing my pants, we finally reached the other couple&#39;s hotel, and I bolted to the bathroom. Best pee ever.

Rented a car later, and went exploring! First off we went to Phuket Town for some prawn mee.

We were looking for Freedom Beach. Apparently it&#39;s really pretty but hard to get to!

Hehe our rental car

We found what we thought was Freedom Beach, and what everyone told us was Freedom Beach. Later on back in Singapore I found out it was called Paradise Beach :( But we had a lovely time, anyway! So it doesn&#39;t really matter :)

This cutie came to sit quietly by me when I called him over ^^ His face is all sandy because he was digging in the sand for something HAHA

We stayed there and chilled for about an hour, then we left for the drive to Phromthrep Cape, famous for its sunsets. I was really determined to catch the sunset that day, so we left with enough time to drive there. It was at the southernmost tip of Phuket, so it took us a good 50 minutes&#39; drive!

Well worth it, though.

We drove back and went for another dinner date, at a restaurant really near our hotel, called Da Maurizio Bar Ristorante. It&#39;s consistently named as one of Phuket&#39;s most romantic restaurants, so we knew we had to try it.

The food was so amazing.

I had simple beef bolognese, which was really good. Grace had vongole, which she proclaimed as the best she&#39;s ever had

Then we went back to Bangla Road, where Grace had a really good night. I will say no further.

Our final night in Phuket :( The next day, we woke up early and flew back to Singapore. And that was the end of our amazing second holiday together, and the last one before we started university life.</div>"

My heart is heavy and there are a million things I still need to pack and do but all I can do is sit here and feel sad. I mean, of course I&#39;m excited for this new phase in life, it&#39;s just that Singapore has always been and will always be my home, and I&#39;m actually growing up and leaving it now :&#39;( My family, my pets, my friends, my room, the food, the convenience... Only now do I realise just how many things I&#39;m going to be missing about Singapore.

Grace is on the plane now. I&#39;ll be seeing her in about 48 hours. Feeling excited and scared and nervous and sad all at the same time. Not looking forward to saying bye to my loved ones tomorrow... :("

Upon reaching our hotel, we called for (free) breakfast to be served to our room! Eggs, toast, bacon, the like. And then we took a nap HAHAHA. I hadn&#39;t slept a wink before my flight, so I was super tired. After waking up, we decided to explore the area!

The mall was really quite big! Anyway, we went there because I got some of my facial products confiscated at the airport (because I&#39;m dumb like that) and hence had to find replacements asap :( We ended up taking neoprints as well HAHAHA.

Found a shop that sold shorts, and I bought 3 for 200baht, which is SGD8 wtf. We also found a travel agent and booked day tours for the next 3 days! Spent a couple of hours discussing programmes and negotiating prices. We got really good prices! If anyone&#39;s interested, we booked with Pink Angel Travel :)


After some shopping and booking, we asked for food recommendations and were directed to a restaurant called The Six Restaurant or something like that? Couldn&#39;t find it on Google. They serve Thai and Middle Eastern food.

<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr171/sarahyip/Photobucket%20Desktop%20-%20Sarahs%20MacBook%20Pro/phuket%20part%201/P1030965.jpg~original"" title="""" />
Our first local meal in Phuket! Tom yum, green curry, Thai fishcake and spring rolls. Yum!

After dinner, we explored a little bit and got enticed to go to a ping pong show. I already knew that the drinks inside were exorbitantly priced, so I didn&#39;t intend to stay. In the short while we were there, we saw a lady pull out two live fish from her vagina.... We left right after that. A bottle of beer would have cost us at least SGD36, which is fucking ridiculous, even by Singapore club standards. A Heineken costs only about $15 at Zouk.

We went back to our hotel and decided to order an in-room massage to end our first night! We got two ladies called Pim and Poy, who gave us the most amazing 1.5 hour massage we&#39;ve ever had. I felt soooo good. I really love hard massages, those which hurt and leave your skin red/tingling/bruised the next day, and this was the hardest massage I&#39;ve ever gotten. I LOVED IT. We slept really well that night :&#39;) It only cost us about $36, the cost of a beer at the ping pong show lol.


<u><b>Day 2: Saturday, 24 August</b></u>

Up and early for Tiger Kingdom! I was super excited for this one, because tigers are my absolute favourite animals. I was prepared to pay any price, and I paid over SGD100++ hehehe. It was all worth it. You&#39;ll see why!

Be prepared for an onslaught of tiger pictures!

Enjoying a tummy rub ^^

It was an amazing experience. I got to see and touch all sizes of tigers, from 4-month-olds to 2-year-olds (which were huge already)! In case you were wondering, as I did, the tigers aren&#39;t sedated. They may seem to be sleeping or lying around lazily in the pictures, but if you own a cat, this behaviour wouldn&#39;t seem unusual to you. They really do behave like domestic cats; they roll over for tummy rubs, lick their paws, play with their friends... It&#39;s so cute, they&#39;re like giant pussy cats who could kill you with a bite haha. They&#39;re beautiful and majestic; I was in awe. The handlers/trainers provided lots of toys (like a pole with leaves on the end) to distract the tigers if they were showing a greater interest in the visitors than they should be. None of the tigers showed any aggression, they were all very chill. I love them so much :&#39;) I&#39;m going to get a tiger tattoo soon.

Anyway, after the Tiger Kingdom, we went go-karting which was really fun! No photos because I look like shit in the helmet HAHAHAHA. And after that we went back to our hotel to chill in our pool!

We blasted house music, slathered on sunblock, and opened up our Thai snacks and just chilled in the pool, enjoying the jacuzzi, dancing, and talking :)

We then showered and went for a late lunch near our hotel.

The hotel staff recommended a very nearby eating place which consisted of bamboo huts on the beach!

Crab fried rice, Thai omelette, tom ka gai and Thai iced milk tea ^^

His little snake friend hehe. I really love reptiles, so I jumped at the chance to handle them and take photos! Iguana gave me a nasty scratch with his sharp claws though :&#39;(

So I seem to have completely abandoned my Livejournal, and I feel so bad about it. I don&#39;t know why, I&#39;ve just been so busy living my life and doing things that there is just no time to blog. I guess that&#39;s a good thing.

Since I graduated unofficially in February, I&#39;ve been doing... NOTHING AT ALL. That&#39;s right, nothing productive. And how has it been, you ask? It&#39;s been amazing. Relaxing and mostly free from worry and stress. I submitted my university applications in June, and I&#39;ve since been accepted into Durham University! I&#39;m really happy about that, because I really didn&#39;t think I&#39;d get into such a good school with my mediocre GPA :( Everyone else seemed to have done better than me! I have six weeks left before I fly off. I&#39;m probably flying around the 24th of September.

I&#39;m really excited at the prospect of leaving home to start a new stage of life, especially with the person I love most. At the same time, I&#39;m also kind of freaking out here. I&#39;ve been very much sheltered by my parents my entire life. I&#39;m 22, and until now, I never go to buy my own food. Every time I&#39;m hungry, there&#39;s always lunch or dinner waiting on the table. If there isn&#39;t, either one of my parents asks what I want, and they&#39;ll buy it for me. Sometimes they even make instant noodles for me, although I do that by myself 90% of the time now. My parents oversee my packing for trips, they pack necessities for me, they run out to buy essentials, take care of my travel documents... They cook, clean, and do my laundry. My dad fixes everything around the house, and even mends my torn clothes. My mom pays my phone bills and makes my appointments (dermatologist, psychiatrist, gynae, etc). I basically don&#39;t do anything. So you can imagine how lost I&#39;m going to be without my parents to fuss over me in the UK.

My girlfriend says I can&#39;t take care of myself. She makes my calls, orders my food, helps me ask service staff for help, drives me everywhere... Okay I&#39;m really feeling useless right now :( Anyway, my point is that I&#39;ll be stepping out of my comfort zone when I fly off, and it&#39;s freaking me out. I may fly there alone. I&#39;m going to have to get my own phone line, set up my own bank account, etc. Basically, grown up stuff which I should already be doing. I know that leaving home will definitely make me grow up, so I&#39;m excited for that, but still nervous.

Ah well, I&#39;m already more than happy to have this chance. I&#39;m very grateful to my parents for being so supportive and hardworking and for believing in me. When my mom told me she wants to help make my goals come to life, I almost cried. In 6 weeks, I take my first steps towards growing up. And I can&#39;t wait :)

Other than university stuff I&#39;ve been settling/trying to settle, I&#39;ve also been clubbing a lot, and hanging out with friends a lot. It&#39;s all over my Instagram. I&#39;ve gained a little bit of weight, probably from all the drinking. I haven&#39;t been sober for more than a week since February! It&#39;s been a lot of fun, just hanging with friends, with little to worry about. One last vacation before we all move on and start our hectic lives once more.

Three years&#39; worth of severe sleep deprivation, sweat and tears has officially come to an end. Although I complained numerous times throughout my three years in Ngee Ann, I knew I was going to miss it when it was all over. And I do. So much. What I would give to have those sleepness nights back. The numerous days spent in zombie mode because I had gone entire weeks with about six hours&#39; worth of sleep. The group politics, the small pockets of respite in between to grab a sandwich or to follow my friends for a smoke... Seeing my friends every day, bitching to them, doing work together. Things I&#39;ll always remember fondly.

I hope this life update has been sufficient! I took everything from Facebook or Instagram :) <a href=""http://instagram.com/theguiltshow"" target=""_blank"">Follow me</a> if you haven&#39;t already, because I update pretty much every day!

This past few weeks, I&#39;ve been very lethargic and withdrawn. I think being out there and socialising so much for so many months is finally taking its toll on me. I need a lot of alone time, especially after long periods of social activities. To my friends: if I seem to be cancelling on you a lot or I seem distant and withdrawn, please don&#39;t take it personally! I still love you very much, I just feel like I don&#39;t have much energy anymore, and I seem to need more and more time to myself. I think I only have enough energy to sustain meeting my girlfriend regularly. Maybe I&#39;m just becoming more and more of a recluse?? Yikes. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to naturally up my energy level?

I&#39;ll leave you with some more recent pictures :)</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

"event","<span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">So I got this question on ask.fm, but my answer was too long, so I thought I&#39;d just answer it here.</span>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">Q: why is it so hard to get a gap 3.6 though? my brother&#39;s in year 1 and his work looks so simple! like what exactly is hard about the masscomm course?</span></b>

<b>A:</b> Let me just say that year 1 is bullshit compared to year 3..... In year 1, I spent all my time going out and playing but in year 3 I hardly had time to eat, shit or sleep (not exaggerating). Here are all the things you need to maintain a good GPA:
<ol>
<li>Consistent hard work</li>
<li>Fully cooperative group mates</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">Ability to multitask</span></li>
<li>Ability to survive on as little sleep as possible, preferably none at all</li>
<li>Lack of need for a social life</li>
</ol>
<b>1) Consistent hard work</b>
This is because mass comm isn&#39;t exam-based. We are graded on one large group project which we work on through the semester, many individual assignments given throughout the semester, class participation, and exams (for some modules only). To do well for just one module, you would need to ace the exam, ace about 5 different individual assignments through the semester, and ace the group project, which may be affected by (2). Decide that you can&#39;t be bothered to do just one assignment properly, and your entire grade for the whole semester goes down. Do well for all your assignments but don&#39;t study for the exam? Your entire grade goes down. Do well for exams but didn&#39;t do your assignments properly? Your entire grade goes down. And so on and so forth. So to get a 4.0 GPA, this basically means scoring almost perfect grades for all 34 modules through 3 years, which means almost perfect scores for about 170 individual assignments, 34 group projects, and ~15 exams. Does that sound hard to you?

<b>2) Fully cooperative group mates</b>
If you&#39;re a JC/IB kid, you wouldn&#39;t know the importance of group mates. I mean I didn&#39;t, not even during PW in JC, until I got to mass comm. You work with your group for basically 70-80% of all assignments. You&#39;re stuck with them. Firstly, you obviously don&#39;t get to pick your classmates, which means if you happen to be in a class with many lousy group mates (they have a reputation), you have to grab the good ones - fast. Those you may not even speak to socially. Let me just briefly name the types of lousy group mates. a) the freeloader (who does nothing but gets your grade), b) the boss (who bosses people around but largely does nothing), c) the idiot (who throws out lots of stupid ideas and annoys everyone) and d) the stupid one (self-explanatory). If you happen to have these people in your group, you have two options. You can TRY to force them to do their work, which means sub-standard work and a mediocre grade, or you can do all the work yourself, and let them have the grade YOU worked for. Most people go for the first. This means your entire project grade goes down, pulling your GPA down. Seeing as how there are roughly 34 group projects throughout mass comm, that&#39;s a lot of group politics to deal with. Also, working with friends isn&#39;t a good idea because relationships get strained if they&#39;re a good friend but not a good worker.

<b>3) Ability to multitask</b>
You need some serious skills. With about 5 modules per semester, that means 5 group projects and ~25 individual assignments. Which means some of these assignment and project deadlines will fall on the same day. On the night before, especially if you&#39;re a last minute worker like most of us mass commers, you would have to work simultaneously on different assignments. In my last semester, I had up to 5 deadlines in one day.

<b>4) </b><span style=""line-height: 1.4;""><b>Ability to survive on as little sleep as possible, preferably none at all</b>
Like I said, we would get up to 5 deadlines in a single day. We regularly stayed up nights without sleeping at all. If I recall correctly, I would pull at least one all-nighter a week. And that&#39;s not even what kills you. In one week, with up to 10 deadlines, you would be lucky to get 1-2 hours of sleep a night. And by the end of the week, with only 5-10 hours of accumulated sleep, trust me, you feel like absolute SHIT. You&#39;re falling asleep in the bus, in class, on your bed when you come home, then you&#39;ll wake up in a panic because you have 3 assignments to submit tomorrow, then you&#39;ll catch 30 mins of sleep before school, fall asleep in the bus..... etc. I was almost suicidal in February because I was so miserable from school LOL. I saw eating and sleeping as a waste of time. I did work on my bed, I ate on my bed, I slept in my bed (if I was lucky).

<b>5) Lack of need for a social life</b>
Self-explanatory.

I have attached screenshots of my iCal </span>from November to February, my last semester in mass comm. Hope it gives you more insight into the life of a mass commer LOL.

So anyway, in July, Grace and I decided to have a staycation at a farm resort in Singapore! It&#39;s called D&#39;Kranji Farm Resort. Because we always stay in nice hotels, we decided to have a different staycation this time and go for a quiet one that&#39;s away from the hustle and bustle of the city (god how cliche is this, primary school compo, anybody?)

We wanted to have a &#39;cheap&#39; dinner that night, so we went to the seafood restaurant at the resort itself. Well not really a restaurant, more like kampong style with no aircon :p We thought it&#39;d be cheap, but we ordered so much and underestimated the prices we ended up having an $80 dinner. So much for cheap!

P.S. I&#39;ve been having sleep problems for over two weeks now. I used to sleep for 12-14 hours at a time, no sweat. Now I can hardly sleep 5-6 hours without automatically waking up :( I don&#39;t feel tired when I wake up, but it would be nice to get a bit more sleep. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions? I&#39;ve been drinking camomile tea and taking melatonin supplements every night but they don&#39;t seem to be helping and I&#39;m getting frustrated :&#39;(</div>"

Doubt is humble, and that&#39;s what man needs to be, considering that human history is just a litany of getting shit dead wrong.</span> </i>This is why rational people, anti-religionists, must end their timidity and come out of the closet and assert themselves. And those who consider themselves only moderately religious really need to look in the mirror and realize that the solace and comfort that religion brings you actually comes at a terrible price. <span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">If you belonged to a political party or a social club that was tied to as much bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, violence, and sheer ignorance as religion is, you&#39;d resign in protest.</span> To do otherwise is to be an enabler, a mafia wife, for the true devils of extremism that draw their legitimacy from the billions of their fellow travelers. If the world does come to an end here, or wherever, or if it limps into the future, decimated by the effects of religion-inspired nuclear terrorism, let&#39;s remember what the real problem was that we learned how to precipitate mass death before we got past the neurological disorder of wishing for it. That&#39;s it. Grow up or die.&quot;

<span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">I downloaded and watched Religulous today, and I must say it&#39;s an excellent documentary. It questions the arguments for religion, as well as its usefulness for the good of mankind. As you can tell from the title, it approaches religion in a mocking way, as does its host, Bill Maher, a comedian. It was absolutely hilarious and very logical. Everything that was said just resonates with me, especially this closing paragraph. The questions asked, the points made, everything was coherent, logical, and of course, funny. A must-watch for agnostics and atheists out there. And if you&#39;re religious, I&#39;d encourage you to watch it, too. It will leave you with food for thought. I&#39;ve always thought religion as a whole was dangerous and detrimental to us, and this documentary has further pushed me in that direction. Watch it with an open mind :)</span></div>"

I&#39;ve never been there, only to Disneyland, so I&#39;m glad we chose Ocean Park over Disneyland. We walked so much and got lost a lot, too. We also left with like 4 plushies HAHAHA I always have to get plushies from every theme park I visit :p

"event","For weeks before my birthday, Grace kept assuring me that my birthday surprise would be &#39;epic&#39; and every time she spoke about it, she looked damn excited. I was skeptical as to how she would top <a href=""http://theguiltshow.livejournal.com/352680.html"" target=""_blank"">last year&#39;s surprise</a>, but she promised that this was better. So I took it with a pinch of salt and just waited for my birthday to roll around.

Come 21st February (after our celebration at Zouk the night before), she picked me up in the afternoon and made me put a jacket over my head while she drove me to our mystery location. I knew it was a hotel room (isn&#39;t it always? :p) because she said we would be staying overnight somewhere. When we got there, I had to help her check in because she wasn&#39;t 21 yet HAHAHA #LOSER. I didn&#39;t peek at the hotel name, though.

Eventually I got to see where we were because we had to wait for them to make up our room. We were at Hotel Equarius at Sentosa! Went to the spa&#39;s restaurant to have a light healthy lunch while waiting, and then we went to the room.

What could be so special about a hotel room? Did she have a surprise party waiting? A nice meal set up? Decorations? What???

I was completely surprised.

This was the view from our bed. Looking into the large aquarium at SEA Aquarium. Oh my god.
I was completely surprised because I did not know these rooms even existed. Either that, or I completely forgot they did. Anyway, I fucking LOVE aquariums. They&#39;re one of my favourite things in the world, and I love just sitting there and watching the marine animals swim around slowly. I truly love it. And now I got to watch them for as long as I wanted to, in bed.

We decided to stay in and have room service for dinner because I didn&#39;t want to leave our room (she gave me the option of going to the restaurant next door for dinner). We had $150 worth of F&amp;B credit to use up, so we ordered freely :p

Okay there&#39;s a funny story behind this. I told Grace I was going upstairs to take pictures, but then I realised I hadn&#39;t taken any of the toilet downstairs, so I went in and took some. Then I heard her on the phone with the concierge. &quot;Oh could we also have a slice of cake with a candle? It&#39;s my friend&#39;s birthday.&quot; I was a little bit confused but quickly realised that she thought I was upstairs HAHAHA so I acted surprised when she brought in the cake :p but told her that I&#39;d known all along LOL :p

Took this picture at the SEA Aquarium the day before. See those square panels? Our room was on the extreme left ^^ Grace even asked me, &quot;What do you think those are?&quot; when we visited the aquarium and I had no idea but didn&#39;t even think much of it HAHAHA so cunning and sly.


Slept so well that night, after watching the stingrays and manta rays and fishes swimming around. It has always been my dream to build a large aquarium in my house, and just spend hours sitting by it, reading and minding my own business. How calming.

Window cleaning!

ANOTHER FUNNY STORY HERE. So Grace and I were wondering how they kept the windows clean. We assumed divers did it, but wondered what time they did it. Wouldn&#39;t the guests feel like their privacy was being invaded? So we assumed that you couldn&#39;t look in, that the glass was reflective outside. Why wouldn&#39;t it be, right? Makes sense for the glass to be reflective! So for the entire stay, I was prancing around the room in my underwear, at times completely naked. I even pressed my bare boobs against the glass and flashed all the fishes, laughing. I also danced with my butt facing the fishes. I sat in front of the glass, naked, and brushed my teeth. I did everything either naked or topless in my underwear, assuming that no one could look in.

So when these divers suddenly emerged and fucking WAVED AT ME I was so fucking stunned. I was like OH MY FUCKING GOD THEY CAN SEE ME and Grace and I erupted in laughter. THANK THE HEAVENS I WAS FULLY CLOTHED WHEN THEY CAME ROUND TO CLEAN. REALLY. I stared for a few seconds before coming to my senses and waving back at them HAHAHA. Holy shit I really hope the people in the viewing gallery couldn&#39;t see when I was flashing the aquarium and dancing naked and shit. Seriously...

We checked out and went for lunch at the Ocean Restaurant by Cat Cora next door! She&#39;s the first and only female Iron Chef!

Beautiful place to dine in!

So if you&#39;re unwilling to splurge on the Ocean Suite, you know where to go for a meal! ;)

This was such an amazing 22nd birthday surprise. I wasn&#39;t really looking forward to turning 22 because it was just another reminder of how old I was getting and how my circle of friends is just growing smaller and smaller every year, but my baby made it such a good one. I really loved it and I miss the Ocean Suite every day. She&#39;s promised to build me one in our future house :&#39;)

Thank you for making this happen, I love you :)</div>"

Please take me home?
</div><div>I was actually really surprised to see how dilapidated the SPCA was... I wasn&#39;t expecting such a shabby place :( and seeing all the animals, some of which bore marks of abuse, completely broke my heart. I had to struggle to not cry on the spot. When I was 8, all I wanted to do was open an animal shelter and take in every single stray or abandoned animal. I still want to do that. One day :&#39;(</div>"

"event","As most of you already know, I was super caught up in the month of February with my final submissions, final presentations, and final exams. I hardly had time to eat. Not surprisingly, I hardly had time to plan for Grace&#39;s birthday as well :( Thank god she was understanding and not demanding. So this year I did the best I could with what time I had. I hope she still enjoyed her birthday :)

(picture from her Instagram)

I surprised her at 12am near her place, with candles, a slice of cake, a bottle of wine, and a long and heartfelt letter. I hadn&#39;t written one in perhaps a year, so it was kind of a big deal. She had been having a hard time, and she seemed relieved to be able to see me, and cried when she read her letter. We sat by the flickering candles, drank white wine, and talked for about an hour :)

The next day was part 2! Okay so there&#39;s a funny story here. For weeks before her birthday, Grace has been dropping hint after hint. &quot;I really want to go to the aquarium!&quot; &quot;Omg look, so nice! I want to go check it out&quot; etc etc. I kept telling her we should wait because it&#39;ll be really crowded. I actually bought tickets online already. So as we were leaving the playground after her midnight surprise, I told her to bring her camera the next day. She responded with, &quot;Oh, for the aquarium?&quot; AND I WAS SO SHOCKED AND SPEECHLESS. I mean, yeah you can have an idea of where I&#39;ll bring you, BUT WHY SO PRESUMPTUOUS TO THINK THAT I&#39;LL PICK UP ON YOUR HINTS? HAHAHAHA it was all rather hilarious, although I was a little disappointed that it wasn&#39;t a surprise anymore :(

The next day we met in the afternoon and went to Sentosa, where we had lunch at Imperial Treasure.

This is a chocolate chip starfish! Isn&#39;t it cute? I touched it and I poked a sea cucumber as well. It was very squishy like a little plush toy! So cute. I asked the staff member if I could squeeze it and he said, &quot;We don&#39;t recommend that you squeeze sea cucumbers because they will vomit their insides as a defense mechanism.&quot; ..... Needless to say, I didn&#39;t try.

After visiting the aquarium, we went to my house for a short nap, before Grace went home to get ready (and I got ready as well). Then she came to pick me up and we went to get our hair did~ She got a haircut and I got mine washed and blown. After that, we went for dinner at The Clan (my choice, it was also a surprise).

After dinner, we headed straight to Zouk for our respective (yet combined) birthday celebrations! I already blogged about that <a href=""http://theguiltshow.livejournal.com/364878.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a> :)

Part 3 of her birthday surprise: I bought her a Thom Browne tie bar for her birthday present itself. Surprised her with it the next day (on my birthday) because it had just arrived at my house, too late for her actual birthday itself. She knew what I&#39;d bought her, she just didn&#39;t know when it was coming ;)

"event","Hello, I&#39;m back! I&#39;ve been missing for the past 8 days or so because I&#39;ve been having the best week I&#39;ve had in MONTHS now, spending every sleeping and waking moment with Grace and doing lots of fun things. My Instagram is full of colour and happiness and I love it!

And update on my back (if anyone&#39;s interested): I have to take calcium and vitamin D pills every night like a 70-year-old, and the pain is likely to stay with me for life :&#39;( How fucking tragic. Anyway, I went for an X-ray and I&#39;ll have to go back to the doctor soon for a diagnosis.

I&#39;m combining Days 4 and 5 here because I don&#39;t have that many pictures on these two days.


<div style=""text-align: center;""><u><b>Day 4 - Thursday, 20 December 2012</b></u>

The day of our flight to Hong Kong! So we were supposed to wake up at 8am for our 11am flight, but the night before, I checked the tickets and saw that our flight was in the afternoon instead, so we got up later. Walked to XMD to grab a quick breakfast to eat in the car on the way to the airport.

In the car on the way to the airport, our driver said, &quot;Oh your flight&#39;s been changed? I thought it was at 11am!&quot; and I wondered how come we even thought it was at 11am. It was in the afternoon, I was sure..... Right? I took out my phone and scrolled to our e-tickets. Yeah, it says 1pm! BUT WAIT.... 1pm on the 17th of December? Today&#39;s the 20th, right? My heart stopped and I slowly scrolled down. 20th December: flight departs at 10am. We had missed our flight.

At that moment, I was debating between telling Grace I had seen the flight time wrongly, or just pretending not to know anything until we reached the airport and then act shocked. After about two seconds, I very meekly told her that I&#39;d seen the time wrongly and that we had missed our flight. Now, it&#39;s important for me to mention that I&#39;ve never once missed a flight in my life, and neither has my family. They&#39;re very particular about things like these. So missing the flight was a HUGE deal for me.

Grace was pissed at first, and then I started sobbing because I felt so bad and so stupid and I was worried I&#39;d fucked up all our plans and our entire trip. Then she softened and began comforting me. I was sobbing and eating my lu rou fan at the same time, and apologising to her. In the end she kept laughing while comforting me because I must&#39;ve looked like shit, eating and crying at the same time. I guess our driver was worried that I thought we were going to be late for our flight, because he asked if our flight was at 11am worriedly (we didn&#39;t have the heart to tell him the truth).

Thankfully we managed to get another flight, because there&#39;s one every hour. We had to pay SGD150 each though. So we wandered around the airport, trying to use the ATM, etc. And then we realised we were going to be late for our flight(!!!) so we RAAAAAN all the way to our boarding gate, and made it 5 minutes before our plane took off, gasping and wheezing. On the plane, I put my newly-bought stuffed Totoro in the seat next to me, only to have the stewardess tell me I have to put him in the overhead compartment. I then looked at Totoro sadly and said, &quot;No, Totoro!&quot; and she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; to me very apologetically and I felt like an idiot... :(


AAAAND we arrived in Hong Kong for part 2 of our trip! :)

Got picked up by our driver and went to our hotel! Laid around for a bit before heading out to grab a bite and explore the area :)

"event","Around January, I started experiencing a huge drop in the number of questions I was getting daily on Formspring (used to be 10-20 daily) and I didn&#39;t think much of it. This has continued for months now, and I finally know why! I went to check my settings because I thought I had accidentally set it to &#39;Formspring members only&#39; and I found that there was <b>no longer an option for anyone who wasn&#39;t a member to ask me </b>(or any other user, I&#39;m assuming)<b> questions</b>! I was getting a little sad because I thought that everyone suddenly hated me and didn&#39;t want to ask me questions anymore.... :( HAHAHA.

So anyway, I&#39;ve been seeing several people tweet about ask.fm and decided to get myself an account yesterday. It seems really similar to Formspring, except I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not only restricted to members? (Just checked, it&#39;s not! Yay!)

<div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">So hit me up at: <a href=""http://ask.fm/theguiltshow"" target=""_blank"">ask.fm/theguiltshow</a></span>
And, for memories&#39; sake: <a href=""http://formspring.me/theguiltshow"" target=""_blank"">formspring.me/theguiltshow</a>

It&#39;s been a good 3 years and 4912 responses, Formspring. I&#39;m sorry it had to end this way.
You will always hold fond memories for me :&#39;)</div>"

"event","Celebrated my 22nd birthday at members with friends on the night of the 20th of February (Grace&#39;s birthday), counting down to the 21st. It was really fun toasting to my getting old at exactly midnight and having my nearest and dearest friends sing for me (albeit very loudly and embarrassingly). The cuties kept shouting, &quot;It&#39;s 12!!!!&quot; at different times as each of them looked at their respective phones&#39; times, not hearing the others :p

It was a great night! So thankful most of my friends came down and helped make turning 22 a little easier (as you can tell, I&#39;m really very sad about getting old SIGH) :&#39;) Didn&#39;t get drunk at all though, because I needed to be NOT hungover for my birthday surprise planned by Grace the next day :) Will blog about that soon!</div>"

Anyone else going? So excited, been waiting years for this.

<i>You used to take your watch off before we made love
You didn&#39;t want to share our time with anyone
You used to close your eyes when we kissed goodbye
You didn&#39;t want to see me draped in sadness</i>
And now there&#39;s nothing here, now there&#39;s nothing here at all
In a loft conversion off new north road
You were here I was here there was something real here
I know there was

You know I still adore you
But in a different kind of way
You know I still adore you
<i>But things have gotten vague
Baby I don&#39;t ask for much but things have gotten convenient</i>
You know I still adore you but things, have kind of changed

And to think I laughed at you
For how you saw the world, with all that empty space inside your heart
I have to cling to things now, doubles and cigarettes
Forever trying to find you on the lips, of someone else

<i>Just take me back, to the start</i>
When your earthquake, was just cracks
You must ask yourself everyday
Just how high, are the highs?</div>"

"event","My friend Derrick says love is the only war worth dying for. But every time I say, &ldquo;please come back&rdquo;, I feel like I&#39;m trying to find a dirty needle in a haystack, and God knows I can&rsquo;t go out like that. I suppose we wear our traumas the way the guillotine wears gravity. Our lovers&rsquo; necks are so soft. I lost my head so many times. I got sober just hoping my eyes would dry. Still, I drink so much in my sleep, I can&rsquo;t sleepwalk a straight line to the guest room or collapse, hang so heavy inside her lungs.

She speaks and her voice trips across her heartbeat, each word limps into the air. We are gone, she says. And I am no mortician; I have no idea how to put make-up on the dead. I have no idea how to unerase, so I just puddle at the door, my face looking like a deck of falling cards, like everything&rsquo;s been playing me. We tried so hard. But when I said &ldquo;give me a ring&rdquo;, she thought I meant a call. Now I haven&rsquo;t had her number for two years. We&rsquo;ve been saying how many times are we going to keep cutting these red flags into valentines. You know, all those wars we fought have turned our shine into rust, we can&rsquo;t even touch each other&rsquo;s hearts without a tetanus shot.

We can&rsquo;t begin to remember how we forgot there is no shelter in the womb. The heart forms long before the ribcage. My mother swore she could feel me kicking weeks before my feet formed. That&rsquo;s how hard my heart beat &mdash; and it still does. They say the womb is where we learn love is knowing the cord that feeds you could at any moment wrap around your neck. I hold my breath for the entire 56 seconds it takes her to walk to the window to stare at the road to tell me she has nothing left to tell me, we are done, carrying our level heads in our tornado chests.

For the first time, I know she is right. As the dawn, after our first date, we were so young, and I hadn&rsquo;t written an honest love poem yet. I hadn&rsquo;t met anyone I could fall so hard for &lsquo;til the night we kissed on our skateboards, she teased me for going so slow. I said I never want to catch up with the letting go. I want the plead in my throat to forever anger my spine and the seams of your slippers, love, even when the dove crashed through the window, even when our friends said, you can call it love, but you know Einstein called himself a pacifist when he built the bomb.

When they ask why we stayed together for so long I say, I don&rsquo;t know. I just know that we cried at the exact same time in every movie. <b>I know we blushed everyday for the first two years. I know I always stole the covers and she never woke me up.</b>

I know the exact look on her face, the first night she used my toothbrush. The next day, I brushed my teeth like thirtysome times, &lsquo;cause I didn&rsquo;t want to let her go. You have to understand when it hurt to love her, it hurt the way the light hurts your eyes in the middle of the night, but I had to see, even through the ruin, if what we were burying were seeds. There were so many plants in our house, you could rake the leaves even through that winter when I was trying to make angels in the snow of her cold shoulder. She was still leaving love notes in my suitcase; I&rsquo;d always find them.

The day before I left, I remembered a story her mother told me. She said, Andrea, when Heather was a little girl, she couldn&rsquo;t fall asleep without tying a string to her finger all night long, she&rsquo;d give that string the tiniest tug to make sure I was still there. And I&rsquo;d tug back. That was love. That was love. As easy as that. Sometimes. Sometimes."

"event","It&#39;s been about a week since my last paper, putting an end to my three years in Ngee Ann Polytechnic and in Mass Communication. How does it feel? It feels <i>amazing</i>. I&#39;m finally free from the sleepless nights, the waking up in panic to complete unfinished work, the last minute touches on a research paper, the frantic editing of Powerpoint slides before a presentation/pitch, the extreme lethargy after 36 hours without sleep, the juggling of five different assignments from five different modules in one night, the endless deadlines, the non-existent weekends, the completely reversed sleep cycles, the sometimes unpleasant group members, and finally, the politics and drama in Mass Comm (this list is non-exhaustive).

For both of my exam papers I pulled all nighters; one night at Liat Starbucks with Evia and Ashley, and we went straight to school for our 9am paper from there. The other one I studied 12 hours before and hence didn&#39;t&mdash;and couldn&#39;t&mdash;catch a wink of sleep. What&#39;s new? Come to NP&#39;s Mass Comm and you will find that sleep will become a rarely-enjoyed luxury (you&#39;d be lucky to catch 4 hours a night). Procrastination will become your middle name. Multi-tasking will become second nature to you.

Would I recommend my course? I don&#39;t know. Course structure wise we did learn a lot of things, particularly hands-on activities like working a film camera, designing a poster in Photoshop, web design, becoming a radio DJ, designing a newspaper/magazine from scratch, etc. Of course there were content heavy and writing intensive modules (like Media Law, Contemporary Issues, Mass Media in Singapore and Asia, etc) as well. However, I don&#39;t really feel like I benefited greatly in an academic or intellectual sense from the course. It just wasn&#39;t very intellectually challenging the way math was, for instance. I&#39;m not saying I did very well (in fact, my GPA is mediocre at best), I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s easy to do well if you work hard and are consistent for every module. It doesn&#39;t really require intelligence, not in the way physics or math does anyway. (Okay I realise this sounds like sour grapes but I assure you it&#39;s not LOL). Overall, it&#39;s great if you aspire to work in the media industry! You learn a lot of technical and practical skills, that&#39;s for sure.

One other thing to consider is the goddamn politics. Before I entered the course I heard so much about it. MCM has the bitchiest people, the most politics, blah blah. I took it all with a pinch of salt. When I entered MCM, I was like where&#39;s the politics? I made so many good friends, we had so much fun and shared so much laughter together. Little did I know that was something reserved only for Year One. You start out with so many friends. Everyone&#39;s cool, everyone&#39;s <i>so nice</i>, everyone&#39;s <b>great</b>! The workload was light and manageable, you go out every day with your friends and you fool around most of the time.

In Year Two, that&#39;s when you more or less know who your friends really are. You drift from those you used to hang out with every day, you realise some people are just that hard to tolerate, and word starts to spread about the freeloaders (people who don&#39;t do their share of the work), the weird people, the temperamental people... Your circle of friends shrinks. The workload gets heavier, and you realise it&#39;s impossible to <b>not</b> stay up all night to complete your work.

Year Three was when I really finally saw why everyone had warned me about the politics. The workload is craaaazy intense and I&#39;m not even exaggerating. All the deadlines fall in the same week (that&#39;s at least five) and you sleep, eat and breathe schoolwork. I even dreamt about schoolwork numerous times and then I woke up and had to really do it. Fun. Eating becomes a waste of time, sleeping becomes absolutely impossible. Coffee and Red Bull become your best friends. Dressing up for school becomes ridiculous because who can be fucked when you have three deadlines on the same day and you haven&#39;t slept? With the intense workload, the claws and fangs come out. There&#39;s so much bitching, so much backstabbing. You realise many of your friends can in fact keep their personal and professional lives separate. Do your work, or you will get peer evaluated by your group mates. So many fake smiles, fake niceties, and then literally turning away to roll your eyes or bitch to your friend on Skype. I consider myself lucky I haven&#39;t been the target or centre of any of this drama. It&#39;s ridiculous.

Don&#39;t come to MCM if you can&#39;t handle this shit man. If you&#39;re weird you&#39;d better have a loud personality and insane self-confidence to go along with it. You will get made fun of openly, and shunned. So many people in MCM are outspoken, outgoing and have a loud personality and they will climb all over you.

Okay I made my course sound extremely horrible and scary. Well, it wasn&#39;t to me. I must say even after all the hard work and politics (which I rather enjoyed witnessing), I enjoyed myself and met some very amazing people who are among my best friends now. I don&#39;t regret it at all. Although it has probably made me a bitchier and nastier person, this is what I will need if I desire to work in the media industry. NP MCM: real life experience.

I actually miss it already. Feels kind of weird not having anything to worry about. Ah, sweet freedom!

I&#39;ve had a fantastic week, what with the end of poly life, Grace&#39;s birthday, and then mine. Updates soon! :)"

Time for Day 2 of my Taiwan/HK trip in December! <a href=""http://theguiltshow.livejournal.com/360440.html"">Day 1 is here</a>, if you haven&#39;t read it.

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<u><b>Day 2 - Tuesday, 18 December 2012</b></u></div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
We tried waking up early for breakfast but being pigs, we only woke up in time for brunch. Every morning we would bicker over who would get out of bed to shower first, and once we were in the shower, we would bicker over who would step out first :p Perhaps one of the hardest things in life is stepping out from a steaming hot shower and into a cold air-conditioned room in winter. 

So we left our hotel room and I brought her to this little eatery in Ximending my family and I always go to when in Taipei! We walked over because as I mentioned, XMD was five minutes from our hotel.

When we were there I realised I&#39;d forgotten to put the battery back in my camera after charging, so these pictures are from Grace&#39;s camera.

We had two bowls of lu rou fan, two bowls of egg soup, two cups of pearl milk tea and one large oyster omelette, all for about SGD8, if I remember correctly. Food in Taipei is so cheap!

So our plan for the day was to shop. We decided to head to <b>Wufenpu</b>, a wholesale market. Took a cab down. Unfortunately we went too early (around 12pm) and most shops were still closed, so we decided to head elsewhere.</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

Our next stop was this store! It&#39;s an LGBT store selling clothes, binders, DVDs, and a lot of other stuff (including sex toys) ;)

The sales assistant/owner of the shop was damn cute because she grew up in LA (we found out later) and hence had the cutest accent and once she started speaking, Grace looked at me because she knew I&#39;d like it HAHAHA. She kept shooting me cute warning looks and telling me to &#39;stop it&#39; when she had the chance because I kept smiling HAHAHA. Anyway she was really nice and chatted with us (or rather, Grace, because I didn&#39;t dare to talk to her much HAHA) for a while before we left! Grace bought several hundred Singapore dollars&#39; worth of clothes she was very happy with :)

We explored the alleys and found a little cafe to sit and eat.

This doesn&#39;t look like much, but it&#39;s the best fucking shaved ice ever. The ice is milky and sweet and so fine (like ice cream), topped with mango ice cream and generous chunks of sweet mango. Fuck me.

As you can see, we ate A LOT. There is no shortage of food in Taiwan. I seriously never felt full and I was always starving, like not even just peckish, but STARVING. I felt my stomach growling perpetually and had to eat to satisfy it for maybe 30 minutes at most... It was insane. 

Let me summarise the things we ate that day:

Lu rou fan, pearl milk tea, egg soup, oyster omelette, cheese and pork croissant, pork sandwiches, mee sua, Korean pancake, roasted mochi, lu rou fan (for the second time), and shaved ice. 

Everyone on Twitter and Instagram kept expressing jealousy because of our food pictures HAHAHA. Okay that&#39;s it for Day 2! More next time :)</div>"

"event","The most hectic week of my life is FINALLY over. The entire week, I&#39;ve been doing work round the clock and only sleeping in the evening and then napping for a few hours, and waking up around midnight to do work until morning/afternoon then sleeping in the evening, etc. I also fell very sick and missed 3 days of school AND the event I worked for months to plan... Unbelievable, but when I saw the pictures, I felt like crying because I worked so hard and I couldn&#39;t even witness it :( Sigh.

Still feverish as of now. But I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not why you&#39;re here, to read about my schoolwork and my health... I&#39;ve finally found a little pocket of time to quickly blog about my trip in December. I&#39;m going to be doing a day by day post so I&#39;ll have a total of eight posts about my trip! :)


<div style=""text-align: center;""><u><b>Day 1 - Monday, 17 December 2012:</b></u>

I woke up very, very excited. My first trip with Grace! Our flight was at 8am, so I spent the night before frantically packing and texting Grace to tell her how excited I was. Packed my makeup and my toiletries and all my last minute stuff, then took a cab at 6am to Serene Centre, where she picked me up and we shared a very quiet car ride with secret smiles, and the air was heavy with excitement :) :) :)

Reached the airport and had a quick breakfast of KFC, then we went in and boarded our flight!

As I said in my previous visuals post, we stopped over at HK first before our connecting flight! Love the Hong Kong airport, it&#39;s so huge and spacious and naturally well-lit. One downside: you have to walk fucking AGES to get to your gate. HATED this, especially towards the end of our trip. Tell you why in another post :p

Eating dimsum


By the way my standard luggage weight is always around 20kg. This increased later on LOL. Alright so we took our connecting flight and landed in Taipei!!!!! :) So exciting! I&#39;ve been to Taiwan twice before, and loved it each time, so I couldn&#39;t wait to bring Grace around (she&#39;s never been there before this trip)!

I was very excited about our hotel! I had done a lot of research on hotels prior to the trip and I booked a very well-reviewed hotel in a prime location, at a good price, too! They won some travel award. Also, it&#39;s a boutique hotel, extremely quirky and well-designed :)

<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr171/sarahyip/Taiwan%20HK%20December%202012/lumix/P1000638_zps298055a7.jpg"" title="""" />
Each room has a different theme, and as you can see, ours is bicycle-themed! Grace was in a biking phase just before the trip, so naturally she was very excited about this. That&#39;s Grace&#39;s tiny suitcase (she insists mine is ginormous) which is like 2/3 of mine, and weighed like 4-5kg less LOL. I always overpack, but it&#39;s safer to overpack than underpack ;)

OH FUCK FORGOT TO MENTION THAT. I FUCKING. FORGOT. MY. BRAS. HAHAHAHAHA. The only one I had was the one I was wearing..... (I bought two on my trip) HAHAHAHA STILL CAN&#39;T BELIEVE I FORGOT ALL MY BRAS. So much for overpacking lol.

Very small, clean, and cosy. No windows, but we didn&#39;t mind! It just added to the cosiness :)

Even the floor was textured like metal ramps! What lovely attention to detail.

If you&#39;re interested, we stayed in <b>CityInn Hotel Plus - Ximending</b>. We paid around $112 per night, for two people! Really good deal, I&#39;m so pleased with myself (I did all the research and booked all the hotels for us hehe). Also service was really good, we left cup noodles lying around and housekeeping stacked it nicely and even gave us chopsticks!!! We didn&#39;t even request for them.

<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr171/sarahyip/Taiwan%20HK%20December%202012/lumix/P1000642_zpsfe1f12b3.jpg"" title="""" />
The location was amazing, it was literally just across the road from TWO of the MRT entrances, both equal distance from the hotel, which were also underpasses to the heart of Ximending itself! You can get there in about three to five minutes of walking.

Ximending is supposedly the trendiest shopping district where all the young people hang out! Also I read that it&#39;s the LGBT district hehe. Saw many, many butches though LOL Taiwan is lesbian capital.

Our first destination: <b>Shida Night Market</b>

I&#39;v been to a few of the other night markets previously but I remember only this one stood out, because of its shopping. If you didn&#39;t already know, night markets are a must visit in Taiwan! If not for its amazing variety of delicious and very cheap street food, for its ambience! It&#39;s something that&#39;s very Taiwanese and everyone should experience while in Taiwan. I feel that Shida is more for young people because it&#39;s very near a university, so the prices and clothes are student-friendly. Lots of hip little boutiques, cafes, and not to mention street food!!! *__* (my favourite part about Taiwan)

<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr171/sarahyip/Taiwan%20HK%20December%202012/lumix/P1000657_zps5efc728c.jpg"" title="""" />
MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE DISH!!!!11!1!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!1 Lu fucking rou fan. YUM. Also a must-try.

So we browsed the stalls, bought lots of food from different vendors, shopped a little, and decided to set off to a place I&#39;ve read a lot about that was in the vicinity. Took us A LOT of walking in alleys and asking for directions to find it! But it was worth it :)

Smells just a teeny bit like cat piss, but it&#39;s mild enough to ignore :p

Cutie patootie


Okay I think we were really tired from flying and also shopping, so we took a cab back to the hotel. But before going up, we stopped at Family Mart (literally 5m from the hotel) to buy snacks! And cup noodles. Family Mart is like 7-11. It&#39;s everywhere.

<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr171/sarahyip/Taiwan%20HK%20December%202012/lumix/P1000697_zps97f1cc03.jpg"" title="""" />

And that&#39;s all we did for Day 1! Not much, because as I said, we were kind of tired already. I&#39;ll continue the rest another day. Also, we filmed vlogs! I think I&#39;ll compile them another day because I&#39;m really too busy and tired these days to edit videos AND photos. Few more weeks till school ends! *persevere*

Till next time! :)</div>"

Never really thought anyone would want to plagiarise my writing and my blog posts until I accidentally chanced upon this girl&#39;s blog. Remember my post back in March, &#39;<a href=""http://theguiltshow.livejournal.com/339196.html"" target=""_blank"">To anyone who thinks they could love me</a>&#39;?

I came across <lj user=""hot_messsss"" />&#39;s blog (because she added me on LJ) and I was a little taken aback because I saw that very post, copied wholesale, on her blog. Because she had texted me before, I very nicely texted her to request that she credit me.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr171/sarahyip/screenshots/photo_zpse1f98c8f.png"" title="""" width=""800"" /></p><p>
I then went back to her blog a few days later. Still no link back to my blog. So I commented on her blog post, curtly and coldly this time, something like &quot;Hi please credit me thanks&quot;. She took the entire post down. I let it slide.


I&#39;ve just been alerted to another incident. Someone told me to take a look for myself, and I did. This is what I found.

She posted on 13 January:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" border=""0"" height=""500"" src=""http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/rr171/sarahyip/screenshots/ScreenShot2013-01-16at35905AM_zps74769117.png"" style="""" width=""800"" /></p><p>

<b><a href=""http://hot-messsss.livejournal.com/75414.html"" target=""_blank"">13 January 2012, 6.35pm</a></b>
<i><b>The past few nights</b>, I&#39;ve been wandering the streets all alone, worried sick. That soon turned to fury, nothing like I&#39;ve ever felt before. I was screaming in the streets like a mad woman past midnight, crying, and pacing up and down. I was exhausted, very shaken and extremely furious.

<b>It&#39;s 6.30pm</b> and<b> night time</b> is starting to filter through the curtains. I&#39;ve been spending<b> the day</b> in bed, recuperating. And it&#39;s been lovely.

Today I wondered if I would ever write a love letter again. Or even a letter. Would anything ever compel me to translate my emotions into handwriting again?

I recall the days, when I used to write frequently. I would write letters laden with emotion, fold them into paper planes, and fly them out the window. I&#39;d hope someone would pick them up and read them. It was cathartic.

If you&#39;ve ever gotten letters from me, man, I must have loved you then. I think the last time I picked up a pen and paper was in <b>June</b>.</i>

<i>Something happened 2 nights ago which left me wandering the streets at 5am all alone, worried sick. That soon turned to fury, nothing like I&#39;ve ever felt before. I was screaming in the streets like a madwoman at 6am, crying, and pacing up and down. I was exhausted, very shaken, and extremely furious.

If you&#39;re my friend you&#39;d realise I don&#39;t like talking about personal stuff or problems very much. Only very rarely do I reach out. And I appreciate those who don&#39;t probe. Thank you :)

It&#39;s 7am, and the morning light is starting to filter through the curtains. School, especially convex, is sucking up all my energy. I&#39;m spending this weekend in bed, recuperating. And it&#39;s been lovely. Although I get calls from my lecturer every single day lol.

Today I wondered if I would ever write a love letter again. Or even a letter. Would anything ever compel me to translate my emotions into handwriting again?

I recall the days, years ago, when I used to write frequently. I would write letters laden with emotion, fold them into paper planes, and fly them out the window. I&#39;d hoped someone would pick them up and read them. It was cathartic.

If you&#39;ve ever gotten letters from me, man, I must&#39;ve loved you then. I guess you can gauge how much I loved you by the number of letters I wrote to you. I think the last time I picked up a pen and paper was in March.

Okay, I&#39;m tired. Looking forward to alone time with Omelette when I wake up ^_^</i>

They are so similar that I&#39;ve bolded the parts that are different, not the parts that were copied. Because very obviously, she copied the whole thing and altered some parts to fit her. Night time is filtering through the curtains? Really?

I scrolled down further and this is what I found:

<i>I&#39;ve been plagued by tinges of sadness the entire night and I do not know why. It&#39;s not a good feeling at all, obviously. And the worst part is nothing can make it better. I&#39;m a terrible person, I don&#39;t feel emotionally ready to go out and see people. Why do I always find myself in these situations? I&#39;m so tired and so torn. It&#39;s been a long while since I felt this upset and I can&#39;t even fully explain why. I think the saddest thing about me is that I can&#39;t walk away from people, I just wait for them to walk away from me, and I deal with the pain all by myself. I&#39;m used to that.</i>

<i><b>I&#39;ve been plagued by tinges of sadness the entire night and I do not know why. It&#39;s not a good feeling at all, obviously.

Her second line:

<i><b>I&#39;m a terrible person, I don&#39;t feel emotionally ready to go out and see people</b> tomorrow. Honestly feel no one should love me because in the end I always hurt them anyway. Time for a nightcap?</i>

The rest of her post:

<i><b>Why do I always find myself in these situations? I&#39;m so tired and so torn. It&#39;s been a long while since I felt this upset and I can&#39;t even fully explain why. I think the saddest thing about me is that I can&#39;t walk away from people, I just wait for them to walk away from me, and I deal with the pain all by myself. I&#39;m used to that.</b>

Is this my fault? I&#39;m at a complete loss of what to do. (I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone)</i>

Obviously, no one can contest that this is a direct wholesale copy of THREE of my blog posts, merged into one &quot;original&quot; post of hers.

Also, this girl has been talking to my girlfriend for a long time, texting her, tweeting her irrelevant shit that no one cares about, etc. She started off by creating an anonymous Twitter account back in 2011 and assuming the identity of &#39;Aurelia&#39;, to carry out conversations with Grace on Twitter and subsequently, through text. Which is how she revealed her identity. Obviously, I didn&#39;t take kindly to this. Like, why are you creating anonymous accounts JUST to talk to my girlfriend? (She only followed one person and tweeted exclusively to Grace) She then started talking to me as well. Obviously, I was very nice to her at first.

<span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">Hla Yamin Thwe, </span>did you really think I wouldn&#39;t eventually read your plagiarised posts? Or do you just find nothing wrong with directly copying people&#39;s writing and passing it off as your own? I think you do know it&#39;s wrong, because you took down your post after I commented on it asking you to credit me. What&#39;s wrong with crediting or linking back? Too much for you to bear that you had to <b>take the whole post down</b>?

Do you not have a shred of dignity or originality? What the fuck is wrong with you?

Those posts were written in deeply troubled and emotional times for me. They&#39;re not things you simply quote and pass off as your own. I take personal offence. The March post was the worst. That was a very long and very personal entry for me to write. For you to simply pass it off as your own was already outrageous enough. Now I find out you&#39;ve copied more of my posts. I don&#39;t take plagiarism lightly.

So what, did you ACTUALLY wander the streets just like I did, feeling the EXACT same emotions I felt? Did you REALLY write letters JUST LIKE I DID, literally doing EXACTLY what I did and flying them out your window too? How coincidental! We must be soul mates :-)

Please link back to my blog in all of your posts that you have copied from me. It would also be decent of you to at least apologise to me. Or are you going to plagiarise this too? :-)

Fun fact: Did you know that copyright laws cover blog posts as well? :-)"

Although I get calls from my lecturer every single day lol.</p><p>Today I wondered if I would ever write a love letter again. Or even a letter. Would anything ever compel me to translate my emotions into handwriting again?</p><p>I recall the days, years ago, when I used to write frequently. I would write letters laden with emotion, fold them into paper planes, and fly them out the window. I&#39;d hoped someone would pick them up and read them. It was cathartic.</p><p>If you&#39;ve ever gotten letters from me, man, I must&#39;ve loved you then. I guess you can gauge how much I loved you by the number of letters I wrote to you. I think the last time I picked up a pen and paper was in March.</p><p>Okay, I&#39;m tired.

It&#39;s about a gay couple which has filed a legal challenge in the High Court, which claims that Section 377A of the Penal Code is unconstitutional. 

I scrolled down to the comments section, and I was surprised to find such hateful, homophobic and ignorant comments. It was difficult (and infuriating) to read, to say the least. Here are some of the comments that I read.


<center>

Take note of the extremely poor command of English.

Again, note poor language skills.

Also, <b>Tan </b>calls human beings &quot;perfect creatures&quot; and yet, he chooses to compare us to the lowly cockroach. Household pest. Brown, tiny, found around garbage and uneaten food. I can safely say that 90% of humankind has no tolerance for cockroaches.

Well <b>Tan</b>, if you want to compare the mating rituals of insects...

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">Sexual cannibalism: </span>
<b>Female praying mantises</b> lure males in with pheromones, then proceed to mate with them, and happily <b>chew the males&#39; heads off</b> during the process. Literally devouring him.

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">Sexual suicide and group sex:</span>
In <b>honeybee</b> hives, the queen bee mates with <b>an average of 12 drones</b> (male bees) per mating flight. The males take turns mounting the queen during flight. Also, when a male pulls away, <b>his barbed penis and abdominal tissues are ripped out of his body and he dies</b>.

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">Rape:</span>
Male <b>Madagascar hissing cockroaches </b>push females into a corner and <b>take them by force</b>, while females resist by kicking with their hind legs.

Hmm. Perhaps <b>Tan</b> is showing his penchant for forceful sex or even rape by comparing humans to cockroaches :-)

Also, <b>Sam</b>, plants don&#39;t have sex. There are male and female flowers, but the female flowers are fertilised by bees, flies, butterflies, and other flying insects you find around flowers.&nbsp;That&#39;s why flowers have bright colours and fragrances and sweet nectar. To attract insects.&nbsp;Pollen from the stamen (male flowers) sticks to their legs and is deposited on the stigma (female flowers). There are also bisexual flowers (hey hey!) which have both male and female parts. &nbsp;I assume <b>Sam </b>wasn&#39;t in my pure Biology class back in secondary school.

I&#39;m not saying that we should model our behaviour after the behaviour of animals. Of course not. I have cited all these examples because of the &quot;homosexuality is unnatural&quot; argument. No, it&#39;s not. It happens everywhere, with all kinds of creatures.

Cough.
Again with the EXTREMELY poor command of English.

To <b>Reveal</b>: 

What is the purpose of a relationship or marriage? To pro-create? Well then why are sterile men and women allowed to be in long-term relationships? They can&#39;t pro-create. The asshole is not the right place for sex? Ask around. You will find that many heterosexual couples do in fact practise anal sex. I&#39;m guessing you wouldn&#39;t know though :-) 

If the only purpose of sex is to pro-create, then heterosexual couples should be banned from practising oral and anal sex! I mean, what is the point? Unless you have very determined sperm cells which can burrow their way through stomach walls, through the body, through the uterus and up the fallopian tubes to fertilise eggs. Or through the rectum and into the uterus.

<lj-embed id=""286"" />

This is a hilarious and refreshing commentary. <b>1:09</b> is where he responds to &#39;the parts don&#39;t fit&#39;. He also mentions other things, like the Bible saying it&#39;s wrong. A must watch!

To <b>Judah</b>:

Agreed with <b>Trevyboy</b>. Animals are unable to give their consent verbally or otherwise. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if sex was consensual or not. It should be assumed that bestiality is taking advantage of animals, who do not have the capability to verbalise their consent, or perhaps are not even capable of thinking about their actions, as we are. You can say that it is akin to having intercourse with intellectually disabled people, or children, who do not have the mental and emotional maturity or capacity to give informed consent to sex.

If two adults of the same sex both agree to engage in intercourse, who are they hurting? No one suffers a detriment. They are both capable of higher thinking and making informed decisions. It is therefore not the same as bestiality. Do not even go there.

Don&#39;t understand the rest of what you&#39;re saying. Also, it&#39;s <b>377A</b>, not 477A. Might want to know your facts first.

This one really appalled me.

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">Firstly, the violence.</span>

<b>Xanrose</b> described very graphically the violent and sadistic things he would do to either Gary Lim or Kenneth Chee if he saw them in real life. I don&#39;t know if this comment is still there, hopefully it has been removed. It&#39;s horrifying to know that there are people who harbour such violent thoughts towards innocent people who just want the chance to be legally married. What if they act on it one day? So such threats are allowed to be posted on public forums but innocent people cannot get married just because they are of the same sex? What kind of society is this?

He mentions the Nazis. The Nazis. Hitler. Responsible for the Holocaust: the death of 6 million Jews. Don&#39;t really understand the rest of his comment due to bad English but I think the gist of it is that he is justifying the actions of the Nazis. Which is horrifying.

Secondly, how does &quot;should someone decide to make a complaint against us one day&quot; equate to having sex &quot;in public proudly&quot; and &quot;in front of your children and my children&quot;? I just don&#39;t see it, do you? 

I also don&#39;t see how &quot;true blue decent&quot; Singaporeans will be personally impacted or affected by the marriage or legality of the relationships of gay people. No one is forcing you to do the same. You do your own thing, they do theirs.

Did <b>Tan</b> just say that he would <b>KILL</b> his kids if they were gay, saying it&#39;s his responsibility? What kind of person does that?! And you say gay people should not be allowed to marry in the name of love, to &quot;protect&quot; the country. You, <b>Tan</b>, should not be allowed to have children of your own, if you&#39;re going to kill them (or even harbour violent thoughts towards them) just because they fall in love with someone that you disagree with. You are the real threat to our nation and our society.

Again, poor language. I don&#39;t even understand the first sentence. What I can infer is that Anton is trying to say that it&#39;s okay to be gay, just not in public.

Right.

You tell gay people to &quot;think of others&quot; too, and yet you have no regard for their basic human right to love? Is it really selfish of two men to hold hands in public? They are not doing it to antagonise you or to make a statement. They are doing it because they love each other. If you find it unsettling, look away. No one is holding a gun to your head, forcing you to look at two men holding hands. 

Also, are you really likening holding hands, hugging and kissing to porn?! Porn as in the explicit and graphic depiction of intercourse and other sexual acts? Really? Why not tell heterosexual couples to stop their PDA and &quot;apply to become porn star&quot; as well? What about the numerous cases of <a href=""http://static.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/caught_in_the_act/1000746/lovers_cant_control_their_passion_they_openly_french.html"">heterosexual couples canoodling in public</a>, all <a href=""http://static.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/caught_in_the_act/1455516/should_they_be_kissing_here_in_town.html"">widely documented</a> on <a href=""http://static.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/this_urban_jungle/1344758/students_in_uniform_get_intimate.html"">Stomp</a>?

Contrast this with the only Stomp post I was able to find that showed a <a href=""http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/this_urban_jungle/852482/what_a_weird_sight__two_guys_seen_holding_hands_in_public.html"">gay couple merely holding hands</a>. 

Oh I&#39;m sorry, was that post too obscene for you? I wonder why Stomp&#39;s moderators didn&#39;t take that picture down. It&#39;s so horribly graphic! Little kids could see that! How dare they hold hands in public like that?! GET A ROOM!!!

<b>Anon Nymous</b> clearly doesn&#39;t get the point of the article. Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee are seeking to repeal Section 377A of the Penal Code because currently, the law allows for their relationship to be branded illegal. Although the government has stressed that they will not actively enforce the law, if one day someone decides to lodge a complaint against them, the court <b>HAS</b> to look into it, and may very well find them guilty of gross indecency.

They are looking to abolish this, so that there will be no chance of them one day being prosecuted for gross indecency.

Firstly, this <b>Yanping</b> sounds insane.

Secondly, what is Asian culture? You mean intolerance towards homosexuality?

China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. All countries that pretty much share what I think Yanping would define as &quot;Asian culture&quot;.

<b><span style=""font-size:13.5pt;"">Also all countries that have legalised same-sex activity.</span></b>

Singapore stands among the minority, with Brunei, Burma and Malaysia.

I only selected East Asian and Southeast Asian countries as examples, as the other countries in Asia are pretty different from Singapore in terms of culture.

Also, we all know the vast majority of people in the Americas and Europe frown upon or do not practise bestiality. <b>Yanping</b> also seems to think that sleeping with (I assume she means it in the most innocent sense of the word because she used &quot;have sex&quot; prior to this) flea &quot;invested&quot; (LOL) dogs is an act of depravity. The dictionary definition of &#39;depravity&#39; is &#39;morally corrupt&#39;. Hey guys guess what, in <b>Yanping&#39;s</b> eyes you are all morally corrupt for cuddling up with your favourite four-legged friend!!! How awful!

Don&#39;t lump us all with small-minded, Western-hating homophobes like you. Nearly all of our neighbours have decriminalised homosexuality. It is NOT an &quot;Asian culture&quot; thing.

I&#39;m taking &quot;All biological evidence does not support same sex as natural&quot; to mean &quot;there is no evidence to support that homosexuality is genetic&quot;. The whole &#39;genetic vs environmental&#39; argument has been done to death.

According to Simon LeVay in his book (&quot;Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why: The Science of Sexual Orientation&quot;), gay men were found to have significantly more older brothers and sisters than straight men, and significantly fewer younger brothers and sisters too. LeVay states that this is a matter of birth order. Also, butch and femme females differ anatomically in two areas: 2D:4D ratio and hip-to-waist ratio.

I think we can say that homosexuality comes about via a number of factors, both biological and environmental. One&#39;s personality, family, childhood experiences, and perhaps other genetic factors all play a part in determining one&#39;s sexual orientation.

Sexual orientation is not even fixed. It is fluid. At different points in our lives, we experience different feelings and are attracted to differet people. The Kinsey scale represents both ends of the homosexual-heterosexual spectrum, and aims to show that we are at different points of the scale at different points in our lives, based on past sexual experience and sexual attraction.

Up till now, I have yet to read a legit argument against homosexuality.

Let me summarise the common arguments.

<b>1. The Bible says it&#39;s wrong.</b>

Every time someone bases their arguments on the bible, I automatically write you off. The bible is 2000 years old. Your argument is invalid. Do you have nothing more than an ancient storybook to base your argument on? How pathetic. 

<b>2. It&#39;s unnatural.</b>

Already argued otherwise above.

<b>3. It doesn&#39;t allow for pro-creation and hence hinders the growth of the human race.</b>

Argued above.

<b>4. It will encourage the legalisation of bestiality, paedophilia, etc.</b>

Argued above.


Personally, I believe that men are homophobic because they are afraid. Afraid of what, you ask? Well, all our lives, women have been subject to men&#39;s wandering eyes, and sexual advancements. Every day, we find ourselves worrying about every slightly suspicious-looking man that lingers nearby. Is he a potential rapist? Molester? Or another creepy guy who&#39;s going to stare at me and talk to me and follow me home? Every single day. I have found this to be a problem since I turned 12. That&#39;s 9 years of being stared at, being molested (yes, I got molested before), being talked to in a creepy manner, and all sorts of uncomfortable events brought about by the actions of men. I know that all of you females are nodding in agreement right now. We can&#39;t even snub these men openly and obviously because if they wanted to, they could easily overpower us and rape/murder/assault us. We have everything to lose. So we keep quiet and rage on the inside. We lose in every way.

Men never have to worry about this. Or they rarely do, anyway. So the idea that homosexual men actually have the physical capability to overpower them frightens them. It&#39;s scary to think that they too could be a potential object of sexual harassment, just as we females have been ever since we grew breasts. Perhaps this is why women are more open to homosexuality than men are.

Looking at all the comments, I think it&#39;s safe to assume that 90% of them are men. Small-minded, ignorant and hateful homophobes. Also, I pointed out the glaring basic grammatical mistakes in every single post. It speaks volumes that all these hateful comments are written in extremely poor English. I don&#39;t know about you, but this further establishes the link between ignorance/homophobia and a lack of education for me.

I was horrified and very disgusted to read the hateful comments, but also heartened and encouraged to see comments from people who can actually speak proper English, can explain themselves coherently, and are not small-minded.

Perhaps one day Singapore will be able to move forward as a nation and society and grow to be more accepting of people who differ from the norm. I&#39;m already seeing the difference among my peers, as compared to our parents&#39; generation. Until we enter the workforce and become parents and grandparents ourselves, radical change will not be seen in Singapore. It&#39;s sad, but I have hope! Go, Generation Y!

My period is also arriving in a few days and my veins are pumped full of hormones. Everything I say is deeply sentimental and heartfelt, everything I hear is intensely romantic and touching. Everything makes me cry, it&#39;s so ridiculous that it&#39;s funny.

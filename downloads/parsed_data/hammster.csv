Yes indeed. I locked a lot of old entries and from now on MOST of my posts will be locked, unless they are of such a trivial nature that I really don't give a rat's ass who see them =) So you lurkers.. well I guess you're out of luck.

"event","HI GUYS sorry I haven't been around much K is still here and Squeak just arrived and we have been doing many exciting activities such as playing 1776: the board game (which I guess is from the bicentennial??? AND IS THE MOST BORING GAME EVER) and watching Robin Hood With Furries. TOMORROW WE ARE SEEING LES MIS! :D Also I guess we went out to get tea and accidentally a whole art supply shop as well. Oops.

I AM CERTAIN I WILL BE MUCH MORE AROUND AND TALK-Y IN ABOUT A WEEK JSYK oh and also Bees we totally got your package thank you! I put the Fluttershy toy next to my Oscar Wilde action figure on my bookshelf. They are totes bffs. 8)

I guess this post mainly serves two purposes, 1) to tell you all I am still alive and 2) to share the following anecdote:

Yesterday morning I woke up like FREAKING OUT! Because I had had a really alarming and realistic dream where my parents had told me that my grandfather had died :( And I was having a big DREAM PANIC about 'omg omg no I never got to tell him how much he meant to me omg' and stuff and it was really awful! And then I woke up and checked my e-mail and I had a message from him. Which...

...Went like this: 
""Yppah Lirpa S'loof Yad, Dnarg Rethgujad! Evol, Spmarg""

SO NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THERE. EVERYTHING IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY. \@_@/

"event","<small>Disclaimer: I understand there are many reasons why people choose not to participate in various holidays and respect that. This is not intended to <i>convince</i> people who don't celebrate Valentine's Day for whatever reason, but to present an idea of it that is inclusive IF people want to participate but feel that they are not ""allowed"" to. </small>

SO, VALENTINE'S DAY. I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T ENJOY IT.

That's cool. I mean, I don't enjoy all holidays. I don't celebrate the same holidays as a lot of people, either! And I totally get that <i>most</i> holidays have really problematic aspects to them. 

But <i>I love Valentine's Day</i>. And here is why!

I was pretty lucky as a kid in a lot of ways. One of these ways is that for the most part my family was a good family, and they loved me, and a lot of the things my parents did and taught me when I was small have affected how I see things now as an adult. I guess Valentine's Day is one of those things. 

When I was a kid, Valentine's Day was never about just romantic love or sexual love, at all! For as long as I can remember, my dad would hide little notes and chocolates around the house for me and my mother to find. In the morning we all opened cards from <i>everyone</i>, my parents and my grandparents both. My grandfather always sent us chocolate. I realize that I was and am really privileged to be a part of a family who is able to do that kind of thing, and I think the main idea that I took away from it was: this day is about love. 

It's not about an exclusive kind of love that huge swathes of people are left out of because they don't somehow <i>qualify</i> as being allowed to celebrate. It isn't about the people who are dating or married one person. It's about everyone. It's about me, and you, and the people who care about and support and love <i>all</i> of us. 

I realize I am somewhat... unusually keen on Valentine's Day (possibly this is an understatement)! I don't ever expect everyone else or even most other people to be as excited about it as I am, or excited about it in the same ways I am! That would be silly. But I think we get sold this idea of the holiday that is extremely narrow and leaves many, many people feeling left out and upset, and I think that there are ways to think about it which solve that problem.

So yeah, we all know the most common Valentine's Day narrative: it is for young heterosexual couples who are in love and having sex! To ply each other with overpriced gifts! Buy your ladyfriend a diamond and she'll put out! Etc, etc. I absolutely think that the gender-essentialist and heterosexist undertones we're commonly presented with are harmful (and stupid).  And I absolutely understand the resentment a lot of people feel towards a lot of the commercialism of the holiday, for sure. 

But! I don't quite understand rejecting the entire day and dwelling in bitterness because of it! Many, many potentially enjoyable things are commercialized in problematic ways. There are still ways to enjoy them and buying into the packaged and marketed and sold idea of what Valentine's Day SHOULD look like is only one of the near-infinite ways to participate.

It doesn't <i>have</i> to be about romance or your ~one twuu heterosexual lurrv partner~! In fact, I reject that idea. If that idea was sitting next to me in a James Bond car, I would hit the seat eject button so hard that that idea would be launched into space. NO LIE.

<b>Heterosexual romantic love does not have a monopoly on love.</b>

There are infinite kinds of love and caring and support and relationships humans can and do have with one another. They are ALL valuable and they are ALL worth celebrating.

For me it was about my family, and then later about my friends - the people in my life who I love and care about and who love and care about me. For me, this day is about remembering and appreciating the people in my life and trying to do something to show them that they are appreciated. Does that mean it can't be about romance or sex or couples? Hell no! They can participate too! I am <i>totally</i> making my girlfriend a card covered in love hearts and glitter and sending her some heart-shaped cookies. I'm also making those things for a lot of my friends who I am NOT dating and who I have no interest in dating! Because I love them, too. In different ways. But they are all just as important to me.

When I was working at Bivouac I made cards every year for all my co-workers. When I was a kid I used to draw them for my cats and then tape the cards to their litter boxes! Cats don't appreciate this, or know what Valentine's Day is, because they are cats. But your friends and family and co-workers and acquaintances and anyone who you care about who doesn't fit into those categories... they all do! Everyone likes to be appreciated, in whatever way you choose to show them you appreciate them.

One of the nicest things about spreading the Valentine's Day love outside the expected boundaries of ""romantic partner"" is that people <i>don't</i> expect it. Yeah, most of our media and society <i>does</i> perpetuate the idea that if you are not in a monogamous heterosexual romantic partnership of some kind you are a failure. So you know what I say? Fuck that! You're not a failure. And the other part to this post is: <i>You're not ""single"".</i>

Just because you don't have ~a date~ does not mean you are alone. Think about all the people in your life. You have people you love and care about and people who love and care about you! Whether they are your parent(s), or aunts or uncles, or grandparent(s), or friends, you have people in your life. If you are reading this, chances are *I* care about and love you, for one! :D And even though I only managed to send out about 20 cards this year, and there's more than 20 people who I want to reach out to and appreciate, I want everyone to know that I, or someone else in your life, loves you. Fuck anyone who tells you that they don't count because they're not your boyfriend or girlfriend. Fuck anyone who says that you shouldn't be able to participate in this holiday because you don't have the RIGHT kind of love.

All love is the right kind of love. This holiday is for you.

Okay, here's the <b>very important part</b> so pay attention! I am going to be making and sending out Valentine's Day cards to EVERYONE and ANYONE who wants one this year! This is an extremely exciting opportunity for ALL OF YOU believe me 8| I make the most exciting Valentine cards EVER. They are simply plastered in all manner of the following things:
- Glitter
- Lace
- Love hearts
- Pink
- Sparkles
- Glitter *glue* (yes this is a different thing from glitter)
- Stickers, often stickers of kittens holding roses in their mouths etc
- Enthusiasm.

SO! If you would like to receive one of these delightful missives I advise you to take one of the following courses of action! 
- Leave a comment on this post telling me so that I may request your address
- Email me about it!

Comments are not screened so I would not advise leaving your address IN the comments; if you would like to send it to me please email it so that it is for my eyes only! My email address is hamdrax (at) gmail (dot) com. 

Please feel free to request one even if you don't think we talk much anymore, or anything, I am really excited to make a lot of these and I will not mind even if I haven't heard from you or commented on your posts in like THREE YEARS or something, seriously. I mean you could even request one if you don't have me friended and you're just PASSING BY THIS POST, RANDOMLY, AND WE HAVEN'T EVER TALKED BEFORE.

AND CARLY THANK YOU FOR THE CD FOR ~YE OLDE LONDON NIGHT LIFE~ or wev, I haven't had a chance to look at them yet but I have a feeling I will be very entertained when I do <3

Also I sent out the boxes of cookies today! So that's for you Bees, and K and Squeak, and Squeak I put in some things for Pura and Gatty too so you have to give those to them whenever you see them next, OKAY.

ANOTHER THING I GOT IN THE MAIL: <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v161/hammsie/tapestryjacket3.png"">DAT JACKET</a>. Lucky for me it's hard to tell in this photo how much it DOES NOT MATCH what I am wearing (purple miniskirt and pink floral tights POSSIBLY not the best choice) but its what I was wearing when it arrived, and I was too lazy to change :') BUT LOOK ISN'T IT FABULOUS.

OK, more unrelated MAIL NEWS: I only sent a couple people winter holiday stuff, but in case you dont know, Valentines Day is MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY and it is approaching.... I will put up an official GIMME YER ADDRESS post a little nearer the date, but I'm going to be sending EVERYONE EVER handmade glittersplosion cards for it so. Keep your eye out for that. I make really good Valentines Day cards. Just ask Squeak. :D

Gatty got me to recently and I am delighted by/obsessed with it! It's so adorable and charming and full of aliens and dysfunctional family things!! I have never been a huuuge fan of Dr Who and its related verses, I LIKE it okay, it's not like I hate it or anything, but... idk! I think I am going to need to watch the rest of the episodes with Eleven in them though, because the Death of the Doctor ep in SJA was amazing and ~I JUST DROPPED MR AND MRS POND OFF ON THE HONEYMOON PLANET~ and loool. 

But um yeah basically it's a CBBC DW spinoff about teenagers saving the universe and diversity and aliens and adorableness?? I've seen a handful of DW (and no Torchwood at all), mostly with Nine but a couple of Ten and Eleven and a FEW with Four? And you really don't even have to know or have seen ANY DW to enjoy it, though it might help getting some of the in jokes and stuff.

It wasn't too hard for me to find torrents of it in America and I know you can find it on DVD in the UK. Anyway. Those of you who DO watch it might be interested in this <a href=""http://itwasaliens.dreamwidth.org/profile"">fan community</a> on DreamWidth that me and Gatty started! :D It doesn't really have anything on it yet except a <a href=""http://itwasaliens.dreamwidth.org/300.html"">picture I drew</a> of Luke reading Heat :'D BUT IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD. YOU GUYS SHOULD JOIN IF YOU ARE SO INCLINED!!!

Umm... yeah so that's all I guess!! Besides the fact that I got a paid account on DreamWidth and <a href=""http://pob.dreamwidth.org/icons"">put up a bunch of new icons</a> which I am really more pleased with than is reasonable (SO PLEASED)! :D Um, yeah. So. How are you guys.

- An excellent pink houndstooth newsboy cap
- A pair of rad trousers with lots of pockets
- The Magnetic Fields: 69 Love Songs
- Pictures at an Exhibition, by Mussorgsky (which had been opened by my grandfather and then inexpertly re-wrapped in... cling film, with the note ""I OPENED THIS TO BE SURE THE PROGRAM NOTES WERE CLEAR AND THE PERFORMANCES WERE GOOD"")
- DVD of The Secret of Kells

The collected works of Wilfred Owen
A translated and annotated compilation of ancient Chinese poetry from the T'ang dynasty (which contains poems by someone called Li Ho, MASTER OF THE UNCANNY) (I wish *my* title was ""master of the uncanny"") (it's from my Professional Philosopher uncle) (YEAH)

I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED!!! :D My mom was really delighted by the things I got her (mostly the bobblehead cats but also the neon flannel owl pajamas!!!) and my dad <i>built her a massive elaborate bird feeding stand device thing</i> that is supposed to be... squirrel-proof and stuff lol idefk. He got a book about like The History Of Ann Arbor's Jewish Community which is turns out IS FUCKING BRIMMING WITH PHOTOS OF PEOPLE I AM RELATED TO AS CHILDREN :'DDD lololol it's a small Jew World

Now my cats are either squatting possessively on tattered remains of wrapping paper or trying valiantly to cram themselves into gift bags so basically I guess all is right with the world! :D All these books + I bought myself the TPB of Amanda Connor's Powergirl run and Top Ten: The 49ers (oh man I forgot that Joan of Arc is a superhero police officer in this book) yesterday means OMG YAY ALL THE FUN READING IS IN MY FUTURE. I'M EXCITED!! I kind of want to just put all my books in a big pile and sleep on them like a dragon.

Bloooogh, I am so glad my mom is coming home tomorrow. It's been kind of hectic and weird without her here (okay it's usually hectic and weird when she IS here, but... in a more usual way, umm) and then we can finally get together as a family and do HOLIDAY PRESENT THINGS and the dog will also be back! And, um! Things.

I finished her bobble head animals!!! And I sealed them with this shiny clear glaze... Unforch, dad got the cheapest kind so it sort of..... crackled, when it dried? But oh well. IT MAKES THEM LOOK CLASSY, LIKE THE MONA LISA. <small>probably</small>

And... Mystery Sewing Project is about... a little over half done I guess? I don't know, all of the small fiddly details and hand sewing parts are done so the rest will probably go pretty quickly. YAY ME 8D Also I finished getting all the rest of the things together to send out PACKAGES so that will probably happen tomorrow or Wednesday 8DD I got some little odds and ends to put in your package Squeak (some of them you will have to DISTRIBUTE to OTHER ENGLAND PEOPLE like some kind of HORRIBLE TARDY SANTA CLAUS it'll be fun!!!) and um..... .... yeah

hamdrax: I also found.... stickers of
hamdrax: stickers of... ......old victorian seed packets with illustrations of vegetable men on them.
hamdrax: so I got you those.
hamdrax: there are seven.
sixbagatelles: ........................
hamdrax: they are somewhat troubling.
sixbagatelles: omg.
hamdrax: YEAH!

And uhhhh mostly odds and ends and cookies. SO YEAH those of you who are receiving those they will  be put in the post SHORTLY it is all terribly exciting (and late) :D!!!

IN OTHER NEWS BLuh I don't know why I cannot eat properly?? It's a good thing I do not have any dietary needs or anything (aside from ""get enough/the right kinds of foods to function properly"") (not that I ever functioned properly) because I WOULD NOT be able to manage having to keep track of the right kinds of foods/my blood sugar/whatever. IDK. I need like some kind of machine that goes HANNAHHHHHHHHH YOU ATE FOUR HOURS AGO GO EAT A THING or something. Or like that horrible pixie in the Legend of Zelda. Only instead of going HEY LISTEN it goes HEY GO EAT and then it makes me a sandwich.






....yeah

ETA: Lol I saw the <a href=""http://www.converse.com/#/products/shoes/converseone/builder/chuTayOxCanStaPow1012"">star sign sneaker creator</a> thing and my brain leapt to homestuck. Derp derp! I mean ok yes I realize <i>everyone who reads homestuck</i> thinks of homestuck <i>every time</i> they see anything western zodiac-y! But this is the first time it ever happened to me :') I DON'T USUALLY GET THAT INTO FANDOMS, YOU SEE.
<small>Also man I think astrology is such nonsense but it keeps on striking me what a goddamn stereotype of a <a href=""http://www.astrology.com/pisces-sun-sign-zodiac-signs/2-d-d-66947"">Pisces</a>/<a href=""http://www.astrology.com/aquarius-sun-sign-zodiac-signs/2-d-d-66917"">Aquarius</a> cusp person I am! GOSH. Wacky stuff.</small>

ETA #2: HMM It just occurred to me that I have been thinking about the zodiac and which signs seem to be most aligned with which of the four humors b/c Pisces is SO melancholic, and SURELY PEOPLE BEFORE ME have had thoughts re: combining these two systems which people use/have used to sort themselves and each other into, and stuff, but of course all one gets when one attempts to find anything via google (star signs humors) is ..... astrology jokes. /tears off research hat, throws it on the floor!!!

INCIDENTALLY, ""The Four Humors"" would be a fucking excellent name for a Medieval boy band.

ETA #2: OK, only I care about this, but basically I have been doin' a lot of research about FOOTWEAR and I have discovered that those... 2/3 hole lace-up <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chukka_boot"">desert boots</a> that are really ~in~ right now are like EXTREEEEMLY similar to the sort of shoes that would have been worn by the working-class in the early and mid 19th century (they even actually look a lot like the brogans that soldiers were issued in the American civil war, too!) ... so basically I'm totally gettin' a pair and gettin' my Gavroche on 8) ----EXCITING!!!

Ponyjolras for Hazellwood!

I am not doing these in any particular order aside from the traditional ""whichever ones I feel like doing"" order*, sooo it's a mystery which one I will be doing next so just keep your eye out I guess! I'll be editing this entry to post the rest of them as I get them done :D So if you have one coming keep checking back I guess!

*This will probably translate to ""characters I am most familiar with/think will be most hilarious and/or adorable first"", but you never know. I mean one of the reasons I did this one first is that a lot of the others will have clothing and more complicated ...stuff, and... Well. I thought Enjolras did not need to be clothed in anything other than his ~shining determination~. :')

sexybiopsy: yes
hamdrax: but well it also has the most fucking ladyfail in the history of ever?
sexybiopsy: i have heard a bit of that
hamdrax: women are either good because they are subservient in a way cs lewis thinks is proper
hamdrax: or they are evil because they have power
hamdrax: and this is stated in PERFECT CLARITY SEVERAL TIMES
hamdrax: literally he talks about this EVIL SCHOOL which like, ISNT RELIGIOUS!! AND THE HEADMASTER!!!! IS A WOMAN!!!!!!!!!!
hamdrax: AND IT'S PRESENTED AND ACCEPTED BY THE NARRATOR IN THE SAME *BREATH* AS THE WORST THING!!! EVER!!!!!
hamdrax: and at the same time it's very
hamdrax: LADIES SHOULD BE LESS RECOGNIZABLY FEMININE BECAUSE CS LEWIS THINKS THAT'S NOT VERY HOT
hamdrax: so susan gets punished (basically sent sent to lion hell!!!!!!) for wearing makeup, and dancing w/ boys.
hamdrax: all the ""good"" women are sort of spunky in a generic way and ""challenge"" the mens but ONLY TO A CERTAIN POINT!!!
hamdrax: so it's just the epitome of ""you behave this way, or you are TOO WOMANLY and womanliness is BAD""
hamdrax: but you know you're not allowed to reject your PLACE as a woman or you're also bad.
hamdrax: and the line which is drawn is just a totally arbitrary one because cs lewis KNOWSSSSS EVERYTHINNNGG about how a lady SHOULD BEEEeee
hamdrax: so that is the misogyny
hamdrax: now, the racism!
sexybiopsy: OH BOY
hamdrax: some of the bad guys in the last battle are fantasy!muslims
hamdrax: they are the only brown people in the book.
sexybiopsy: awesome
hamdrax: their ""god"" ends up being an evil demon who has been deceiving them into worshipping it!
hamdrax: and at the end they are basically revealed as being LITERALLY BLIND to its.. evilitude
hamdrax: except for a few Good Brown People who accept the truth that is white european lion jesus.
hamdrax: and become sidekicks in assisting the white children!
hamdrax: :D!!!!!
sexybiopsy: oh lovely.
hamdrax: OH YES.
sexybiopsy: ohhhh c s lewis i will chucketh you out a window
hamdrax: I HATE HIM SO MUCH HOLY FUCKING FUCK!
sexybiopsy: what a bucket of wangs
hamdrax: and I especially extra hate him when people go on about how he was such a great example of benevolent christiandom!!!!
hamdrax: NO, DIAF
sexybiopsy: hahaha oh wow 
hamdrax: I mean as far as I hear TELL the films have TRIED to tone down the racism and sexism which is RAMPANT??
hamdrax: but um
hamdrax: the premise is still ""hooray eurocentric christian bullshit cs lewis made up"" ?
hamdrax: which.... wow I cannot imagine why I would find that uninteresting!
hamdrax: but I sure as fuck do!
hamdrax: I mean when you look at it and think about it aslan/narnia
hamdrax: are basically christianity with all of the middle east removed with tweezers and injected with as much WESTERN EUROPE!!!! into them as humanly possible
hamdrax: except for a couple ~exotic~ elements
hamdrax: and it's like, holy fuck you guys narnia isn't just an interesting premise with problematic aspects!!
hamdrax: <i>NARNIA IS A BIG PROBLEM</i>
sexybiopsy: lsdkjhgdfkljgh
hamdrax: A BIG PROBLEM IN A WARDROBE.
hamdrax: THAT IS WHAT IT FUCKING IS.
sexybiopsy: Yeah I ... have never heard anything that begins to persuade me otherw- LMAO
hamdrax: /gives cs lewis the finger, emphatically
sexybiopsy: /ALSO
hamdrax: I mean it even BEGINS like, hello charming little well behaved white children, come be the tyrannic rulers of our silly somewhat exotic animal/half-animal filled society !
hamdrax: c:
sexybiopsy: ugh yeah
sexybiopsy: FUCK THAT
hamdrax: MMMMMM
hamdrax: fuck it
hamdrax: narnia is an amazing place of OH MY GOD CS LEWIS WHO GAVE YOU A PEN
sexybiopsy: LMFAO
sexybiopsy: SFHglfkdjh
hamdrax: WHO????
sexybiopsy: the correct way to give cs lewis a pen:
sexybiopsy: take pen
sexybiopsy: take cs lewis
sexybiopsy: ram pen in cs lewis's ear
hamdrax: gskefdgfdjsfjl
hamdrax: AGREED.
hamdrax: it boggles my fucking mind that this shit is considered ...classic literature
hamdrax: I mean, I read it when I was 18, right
hamdrax: so this was... previous to very much ALL OF THE ACTIVISM!!! on my part
hamdrax: like, at all, and I was especially ignorant about race issues when I was 18
hamdrax: and even then
hamdrax: some white chick sitting in my bed reading the last battle
hamdrax: I was like "".......""
hamdrax: ""who hit this with the racism stick""
hamdrax: ""is this some kind of tragic mistake""
hamdrax: and if it was LITERALLY the first thing that sprang into my mind and I was like WUTS ANTIRACISM at that point
hamdrax: I mean ...??? YOU'D THINK MORE PEOPLE WOULD NOTICE
sexybiopsy: Yeah I mean I never read Narnia but when people made a contemporary update of the ~classic children's literature that I read as a child
sexybiopsy: that was horribly racist
sexybiopsy: they just used the MOST BARE BONES OF THE CONCEPT
sexybiopsy: and okay the film was shitty but you know at least it wasn't about a white guy going to africa and teaching all the animals AND those black savages how to do AWESOME CIVILISATION
hamdrax: ........AUGH WHAT
sexybiopsy: hahaha doctor dolittle!
hamdrax: oh god THAT
sexybiopsy: I wish I was joking more than I am??
hamdrax: no I...  I know 
sexybiopsy: 8((((((
hamdrax: dr doolittle is especially bad because we are expected to believe that henry higgins
hamdrax: SORRY I MEAN DR DOOLITTLE
hamdrax: like gives a massive shit about how *animals* are treated
sexybiopsy: ghkjfg
sexybiopsy: I don't really recollect the film ..........
hamdrax: rex harrison I wonder if you were actually as much of an asshole as your films lead one to believe /CHIN ON HANDS
sexybiopsy: just the masses of horrible books that recount in detail the AWESOME POSTAL SYSTEM that he helps the USELESS AFRICANS implement and how happy they are that he showed them stamps.
hamdrax: oh my god.
sexybiopsy: see when they made a film of narnia, they should have taken a similar approach. Like CHILDREN + CUPBOARD + MAGIC WORLD + MAYBE A LION
hamdrax: sdfjdshflds
sexybiopsy: when I say a similar approach I mean a similar approach to the more recent update of doctor dolittle
hamdrax: oh yes
hamdrax: narnia STARRING EDDIE MURPHY
sexybiopsy: but was still just like IT'S A GUY HE TALKS TO ANIMALS I GUESS HE IS A DOCTOR OF SOME SORT!!!!
hamdrax: i'm for it.
sexybiopsy: eddie murphy can be aslan
hamdrax: yes that would be a better approach than going ""ummmm maybe if we take out the line about women fighting makes wars bad???""
hamdrax: no no no cs lewis
hamdrax: cs lewis! WAR IS AN AWFUL PLACE FULL FUCKING STOP
sexybiopsy: YEP
hamdrax: /digs him up

sexybiopsy: okay so what have we learned from this conversation
sexybiopsy: 1. cs lewis is fucking terrible
sexybiopsy: 2. eddie murphy should play aslan
hamdrax: yes
hamdrax: ideally, a badly cg'd cartoon aslan
sexybiopsy: yes
hamdrax: Ideally a badly cg'd cartoon aslan which has been character designed to look inexplicably like eddie murphy
hamdrax: ..so it has really big teeth.
sexybiopsy: wow this is beautiful in my mind
hamdrax: I KNOW RIGHT?
hamdrax: I'm imagining like, a cross between alex the lion

JUST A LITTLE BIT?
you could do worse

UM... so hooray tonight is the ""invite our one local Jew family member over and make them eat all of the things with us"" night!!! It's a good night!!! It means dad is taping five layers of newspaper all over the entire kitchen so the latke grease doesn't get into the walls and floor!!!! 8DD

The most hilarious part about this holiday in our household is... well there's a lot but mostly it's that my mother is the only one who is at all organized or motivated to actually do thing relating to it and she is the only non-Jew in the house. If my father and I are left to our own devices, Hanukkah tends to go something like this:

My father: (watches tv)
Myself: (stares at a wall)
My father: Oh hey it's sundown
Myself: Oh.
My father: You know what we could do right now?
Myself: What?
My father: Light the candles.
Myself: Ohhhh, yeah.
(...)
Both: Eh.

This year my mother is also insisting on playing this horrific CD of ~all the modern Hanukkah songs~ that she picked up at like Kroger last year for a dollar OH GOD IT IS BY FAR THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER PUT INTO MY HEARING CANALS!!!!! FUCK. See this is the problem when your religion/culture never had a point in time during which your holidays were simply horrible drunken debauchery. You do not have any amazing medieval ""LOOOLLLL HI ITS JESUS'S BIRTHDAY GIVE US SOME THINGS OR WE'LL TURN YOUR HOUSE INSIDE OUT"" music!!! Am I ever jealous of Christians on that point, LET ME TELL YOU, INTERNET. Seriously !!! Maybe I will just have to attempt to single-handedly debauch some Jew holidays. Obviously that is a wonderful idea and could not possibly go wrong <i>in any way</i>.

But I mean listening to this CD is pretty fucking suffer-y and suffering is really necessary to the Jewish identity so perhaps that was their plan all along??????? IF SO THEY ARE DOING A VERY IMPRESSIVE JOB OF CEMENTING MY CULTURAL IDENTITY RIGHT NOW BELIEVE ME.

I was talking to Bees the other night about Western Society & Culture and their pervasive and unsettling obsession with the Greeks and going OH MY GAAAHD THEY WERE SO ADVANCED AND INVENTED EVERYTHING etc etc (come on you guys we all know the only reason you are insisting on identifying ith all those guys is because everyone who was in actual western Europe at that time was busy trying parts of animals to themselves, painting themselves blue, and running into trees) (this is a proven historic fact) even now when it is more than possible for everybody to know that, uh, EVERYBODY in EVERYWHERE was inventing all kinds of very impressive shit then ! Including, as Bees pointed out, int he case of HER people, like actual democracy! (""1/25th of the population gets a say in how things are run"" is not actual democracy, The Greeks. No.)

And I was like, OH YEAH MAN NO ONE EVER GIVES MY PEOPLE CREDIT FOR ...
....


............ ...... .................... ... ..

ummmmm I guess inventing the concept of not simply saying ""HAHA MY GODS CAN BEAT UP YOUR GODS"" but actually going one step further and saying ""dude not only is our god better than yours but yours DOES NOT EVEN EXIST"" which is pretty impressive concept-wise when you think about it but probably not a very helpful concept to introduce to anyone in the long run all things considered.

More recently, though: humorous self-depreciation, <i>and robots!!!!</i> That might not sound like very much but without humorous self-depreciation and robots I would not be the human I am today, so, THANKS, JEWS, I APPRECIATE IT.

"event","Time for me to get really really frustrated about all the Christmas stuff up everywhere

And apparently time for almost everyone who celebrates it to act like my objecting to this is just due to the fact that I want to be ~treated special~ or because I want to ruin everyone else's fun. YES, YOU CAUGHT ME! I JUST HATE HOLIDAYS. OBVIOUSLY.

Hoo-fucking-ray.

I think what people don't realize is how lonely it can be? I mean... it's hard because I DO like fun, and lights and presents and food and parties and pine trees and candles and being with family and friends, I like all those things, but if I want to participate in them I have to either discard my own cultural identity or ...make other people acknowledge <i>my</i> holidays, which people always get all eye-roll-y about. Even though, you know, we are all expected to acknowledge Christian holidays.

It's just pretty fucking sad-making, I guess. Especially when it is SO easy to say ""holiday"" instead of ""Christmas"". There's lots of things I would have participated in when I was younger because it's easier to just try to push the not-belonging to the back of your mind and leave your culture at the door sometimes, but I can't do it any more. If someone makes a post like WHO WANTS A CHRISTMAS CARD I <i>cannot</i> bring myself to post. I absolutely know it is not, and is never, intentional, but it just feels like a kick in the gut every time. Yes, I could say ""can I have a card but not a Christmas one"", and I am sure they would be happy to oblige, but I am tired of reminding people that I exist. <i>So fucking tired.</i>

Mmmmm another month of people treating me like I am a big grouchy fun-spoiler if I ever say anything about religious and cultural inclusiveness <i>I cannot fucking wait</i>

"event","I was just thinking, and... the interesting thing about death is that you don't KNOW you are going to die until you do. You can be intellectually aware of the likelihood of its occurring being damn near 100% eventually, or even aware of its imminent occurrence being VERY likely, perhaps if one has some manner of chronic disease, in which case one is <i>very unpleasantly</i> alive, but still alive. Until one is dead. At which point one does not exist anymore. 

Sure, previous evidence points to YOU WILL DIE but you cannot know that FOR SURE. It is extremely probable. But improbable things happen all the time; being alive at all is extremely improbable. As many ways as there are of being alive there are infinitely more ways of being dead.

I will not be dead until I am dead at which point I WILL BE DEAD so I will not be able to know that I am dead. So, from the perspective of a human experiencing the world from inside our minds, which is the vantage point from which we all experience the world, <i>we are never dead.</i>

DO YOU SEE WHAT I AM SAYING?

One never experiences being dead, so being dead is literally something that happens to other people. Death does not happen to us individually because as soon as it has occurred we are not us anymore. 

So, from the inside, are we all immortal? I like to think so.

hamdrax: fuck's sake
sixbagatelles: just how is freud in any way still THE authority on the workings of the human mind?
sixbagatelles: calling something 'a Freudian interpretation' should make it inherently dubious
hamdrax: YES
hamdrax: EXACTLY
hamdrax: it should shed a LOT more light on the person who is claiming to perceive things that way than whatever is being perceived.
sixbagatelles: oh man and you can hardly do this with any other thinkers
sixbagatelles: marx yes
sixbagatelles: marxist interpretations are done
sixbagatelles: but if i wanted to write a fichteian interpretation of something
sixbagatelles: which goodness knows i have no intention to do
sixbagatelles: nobody would consider that relevant to the current state of science
sixbagatelles: so why is freud still relevant
hamdrax: yeah seriously marxist things are still relevant because a fuckton of the problems he wrote about are still around
hamdrax: but freud just fuckin showed up and aired his own weird dirty laundry manner of fucked up thinking about gender and shit
hamdrax: and then fucked off again
hamdrax: he was never relevant
sixbagatelles: (sidenote, i love you)
hamdrax: (dhsfls WHYyy because i hate freud??)
sixbagatelles: (yes and because you said it with so many curse words)
hamdrax: fuck I hate freud, K
hamdrax: K do you know how much I hate him
hamdrax: A FUCKTON IS HOW MUCH
hamdrax: he was such a fucking towering stack of dicks!!!
sixbagatelles: i mean as for 'he was never relevant' i guess he invented/popularised The Couch which may count as an achievement
sixbagatelles: but that doesn't really tie into literary analysis
sixbagatelles: ... towering stack of dicks
hamdrax: yes.
hamdrax: that's what he is. a dickstack.
hamdrax: anyway I think most of the things that are wrong with modern psychology are wrong because of freud or as resulting from that kind of thinking ...soooo
sixbagatelles: the question is
sixbagatelles: and this is an interesting question
sixbagatelles: where would psychology have gone otherwise
sixbagatelles: not as in what i meant was not 'yeah but where would we be without him /shrugs' but actually 'omg that would be interesting to speculate'
hamdrax: I suppose it's interesting to think about and probably roughly the same direction given that most of his prejudices were society's prejudices in terms of gender essentialism and shit like that
sixbagatelles: what this leads to is
sixbagatelles: 1. freud is firmly established in the context of the prejudices of his time
sixbagatelles: 2. for some reason freud is firmly established in Everything To This Day
sixbagatelles: 3. therefore prejudices of a hundred and some years ago are firmly established in Everything To This Day
sixbagatelles: this sucks
sixbagatelles: the end
hamdrax: YES BASICALLY
sixbagatelles: but how did that happen
hamdrax: everyone is dicks

...Anyway so like deviantArt has never been my FAVORITE SITE EVER but their image postin' interface is the best one for artists I have seen and I enjoyed posting my arts there for many years quite happily. They've sort of steadily gotten more LJ-like in their advertisements and being sort of horribly corporate and up-themselves, but they have reached VERY IMPRESSIVE NEW LOWS lately!!!

My good pal Ketsu was perturbed to learn that they took away the ""unspecified"" option for genders, and contacted them about it, which you can read about here: http://transfinite.dreamwidth.org/215469.html

Long story short: DA ARE A MASSIVE TOWERING DICKSTACK I'M TOTALLY OUT OF THERE

I am too lazy to take down my gallery but I will not be visiting it or checking it or posting anymore art there from now on. 

Squeak also made a post <a href=""http://ormery.livejournal.com/632826.html"">here</a> and <a href=""http://ormery.deviantart.com/journal/36031370/"">on dA</a> explaining why he is leaving, which pretty much cover my reasons as well.

Not sure where I'm going to be putting my art now, though. I am optimistic about Dreamwidth's image hosting service which is in the process of being ...made, I guess, and about which there is a post <a href=""http://dw-biz.dreamwidth.org/2794.html?thread=571114#cmt571114"">here</a>, where you can suggest things and inquire about features and so on. I'm really hoping it will have commenting/favoriting features and usable tags and so on! I am sure they'll do it right, though, so it's just a matter of when it comes out. It'll be convenient to host my stuff on DW anyway, since I plan on moving there permanently very soon (I just finished customizing my layout! CHECK IT OUT: http://pob.dreamwidth.org )

I'll still crosspost things here, but the fail of all sites which are not DW lately has me not very enthusiastic about LJ goings-on, either. DW is just.. better? In every way? I mean check out their fucking <a href=""http://www.dreamwidth.org/legal/diversity"">diversity statement</a>, goddamn. It makes me cry tears of joy every time I read it :')

SO UH YEAH in conclusion: Fuck you, dA, and if anyone wants a DW invite code, just hit me up."

"event","Yesterday was like the best day ever even though a man at the grocery store was a dick and laughed at me when I dropped a yogurt thing and got yogurt all over my shoes

Squeak and I went to the <a href=""http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/museums/"">Huntarian Museum</a> which is basically just DEAD FETUSES IN JARS, HORRIBLE SURGICAL IMPLEMENTS, THE SKELETAL REMAINS OF WEIRD STUFF, PAINTINGS OF MEN WITH INTERESTING DISEASES which was fun. It was a bit hard to find as it's sort of just in the middle of the RCS with just two small signs pointing at the correct entry point and you have to ask at a desk to get a pass thing to go up the correct staircase and ... but oh well, we found it. Plus they were filming some sort of film outside! Which was interesting! There were a bunch of people in like 1890s clothes going in and out of trailers and stuff. IDK what it was other than that though. Some period thing with parts set in bits of Holborn I guess.

Annnnyway. Then we were wandering about down the Strand and for some reason started talking about Les Mis and I was like DANG I HAVENT SEEN THAT IN AGES (""ages"" meaning ""like 4 months"") and Squeak was like ...YEAH DO YOU WANNA GO. So we went to the theater and asked if there were any tickets left and LO AND BEHOLD THEY HAD SOME SHITTY 20 POUND ONES so we bought them 8D Of course by then it was nearly 4 and so we had 3+ hours to kill, which was... hm. We almost went back to Squeak's place so he could retrieve his glasses, but the tube station was all DUE TO A REPORTED EMERGENCY WILL EVERYONE PLEASE GET THE FUCK OUT THANK YOU and so we all.. got the fuck out! And then we were all ""well we could go to the Leicester Square station but that requires walking so fuck that"" and went to see a film instead. Because we are classy humans.

So um we saw <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_A"">Easy A</a>! Which I thought would be a sort of shitty high school nonsense film and we both went in vaguely expecting to be sort of offended but perhaps also slightly entertained, but then it was ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD???? Like and funny and cute and all the characters were multi-faceted and interesting and charming and stuff! I was pleased. 

AND THEN LES MIS whiiich we got to pretty early so we just hung around the fancy upstairs lounge place for a while and wrote humorous phrases on bits of paper and stuck them to the nibbles menu when we thought no one was looking because we're mature adults. 

Felt sort of bad for the poor bastards who sat next to us since we were pretty much like 

/LEANS OVER BALCONY SNICKERS WHISPERS GIGGLES

The whole time, but.. well. Honestly that's one of the reasons why they should charge less for people sitting next to the people in the cheap seats: It's entirely likely that you'll be sitting next to assholes like me and Squeak who will stage-whisper ""GOOD JOB, MARIUS"" and slow-clap whenever he says ""YOU'RE JEAN VALJEAN!!!"" at the end, etc etc. But really we aren't all THAT disruptive, I mean, we do try to be fairly quiet and not piss people off toooooo much. >_> 

Omg though I had not seen it since the cast change and I enjoyed the new people so much! I mean, I liked the old people too, but it is always interesting to see different people do it. The Valjean was faaairly mediocre but not <i>bad</i>, (although not as funny as Unnecessary Hand Gestures Valjean) (no we cannot be bothered to remember any of their names so we give them stupid nicknames <i>what of it</i>) and the Javert was AMAZIIINNNGGgggg. He was Obviously American Javert (as opposed to Concrete-faced Continental Javert) and he actually ACTED! AND STUFF! IT WAS SO IMPRESSIVE. The Marius and Cosette were FUCKING ADORABLE and I was somewhat surprised as I was still totally expecting Wobbly Marius, but this one is totally Overenthusiastic Marius and it was pretty cute. Eponine was ehhh, not bad, but kinda Whiny Highschooler Eponine. Same Fantine but she had a mullet. Or maybe she always had one and I did not notice. Either way it was terribly distracting this time for some reason. Oh and the Gavroche was alright although not as cheeky as I like my Gavroches. Plus his voice was totally already changing which was quite humorous imo.

I was also totally :D :D :D :D :D because the dude playing Prouvaire is usually sort of meh and a bit burly and unshaven OR THE ONES I SAW PREVIOUSLY had been but the one last night was totally mousy and adorbs and he <i>smiled apologetically</i> and everything !!! Which like, <i>only I care about</i>, but OH WELL. 

And then I came home and passed out because I had not slept in almost 24 hours. So that was my yesterday. It was pretty good.

THEEEE ENNNNND."

Oops. What can I say for myself here. At least I didn't WRITE any of the articles in the death portal on wikipedia.

I'm also missing the <a href=""http://www.orientaltrading.com/holidays/halloween-a1-90000+1237-5-0.fltr"">over-the-top Halloween bullshit</a> of my home country. I feel this is justification.

"event","Sooo the last couple days have pretty much been The Horriblest, but right now I am extremely content because I...

1. Was up early this morning and managed to gather the courage to ask Gatty to borrow some cash for groceries (I do not have access to my bank account and will not for probably another two weeks; long unpleasant story, but it will be fine)
2. BOUGHT GROCERIEEEES and still have roughly two pounds fifty left in case I need to get more tomorrow
3. TOOK OUT ALL THE TRASH AND RECYCLING even though okay I meant to do that on Monday and did not because I was breakdowning I AM STILL PROUD OF MYSELF
4. Did I mention I have groceries, omfg food

I also wandered briefly around the antique market because it takes place right outside Sainsbury's and I had not seen it before. It is actually pretty interesting! A lot of the people there just have stalls with like... A DRAWER FULL OF DOORKNOBS etc etc. Also I was pretty much invisible which was kind of <i>nice</i> (markets usually make me a little uncomfortable cause everyone's yelling at you and I like to observe things without being yelled at) so I have decided that the key to enjoying myself at markets from now on is to dress as scruffily as possible and just do my best to look as much like an out-of-it penniless student who has enough money to buy a day's worth of groceries in her pocket and nothing else. Something tells me this will not be terribly difficult.

Omg and now I'm going to eat some things and take my fucking medication!!! YOU GUYS I am so proud of myself this is more than I have managed in like a week <i>I am the most pathetic but I do not care.</i> I might even go for a walk or something. If I had oysters I'd probs go into town and poke a museum but I do not; that's alright. There's a graveyardparkthing near the church here that I have been meaning to wander through. Perhaps I will go there.

Things are still The Horriblest on the following fronts:
1. school
2. brain problems
3. parental communication

But right now all I can manage to summon the energy for is feeling vaguely smug that I am about to eat some bread and carrots, so fuck it. If basic human things are going to be this difficult then I think I have a right to be disproportionately pleased when I manage them.

<small>Unrelatedly I have a bunch of books which I got in the mail and I am really tempted to spend all day reading Poe except that I spent all NIGHT reading extremely ridiculous shoujo manga and I am just not sure I can manage the former without imagining everything in Sparkly Blushy Shoujovision(TM). Which would admittedly be <i>interesting</i>, but ........ ... .............. ..</small>"

"event","The meeting with my tutor went bizarrely well. HOWEVER, this post is not about that. This post is about being bewildered about <i>how much racism I keep finding in Jewish stuff lately</i>

So like right I am Jewish and I think that's pretty rad and I like learning about the culture and history of my ~people~ and stuff, right. As you do! I was reading a lot of stuff about various old Jewish quarters and areas in London, and I came across a guide to visiting Important Old Jew Places. Soooo I was reading the info, and it all sounded interesting until I got to this part: ""The several hundred Jews who remain here, who still call the East End home, now live among a Muslim population - a latter day immigration of Bengalis, Pakistanis, and assorted Arabs. Some synagogues have been converted into mosques; many of those, like the one at the corner of Brick Lane and Fournier Street, preach a fundamentalist Islam that has no use for outsiders and even less use for Jews.""

I beg your fucking pardon???? WHAT THE SHIT IS THIS SHIT, YOU GUYS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. It's not like the Jews got <i>kicked out of the East End</i> - they lived there cos it's a place where poor immigrants traditionally are ABLE to live! Many of them moved to places that were not holes! Then other immigrant groups moved in! THIS IS OFTEN HOW IT WORKS! Also no one just... appeared in the night, STEALTHILY, and STOLE those synagogues, hiring hundreds of SECRET NIGHT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS to turn them into mosques while NO ONE WAS LOOKING!!! It's not like the East End has been the victim of like secret STEALTH MUSLIM ACTION or something oh my god!!! 

And yes, no Jewish groups are <i>ever</i> fundamentalist or exclusive. (YOU SEE THIS IS ACTUALLY A JOKE BECAUSE MANY OF THEM ARE)

So, whatever. I was disappointed that my keenness in learning stuff about Jews in London was interrupted by SURPRISE RACISM but I moved on. Fast forward to about a week later: I was looking at my book shelf (read: haphazard book stack) for something to read on the tube. I did not feel like heavy-handed Word Of God crap that morning, so I grabbed an anthology of stories and legends of the Russian Jews in lieu of Les Mis. In my experience, Jewish folktales and so on are clever and humorous and passed down for ages and ages! I thought I was going to be safe :( BUT NO

TURNS OUT the book I selected was EVEN WORSE at doing the horrible heavy-handed 19th century WORD OF GOD voiceover narration - and not even in a humorous or interesting or thought-provoking way like Mr Hugo generally is. I got extremely wary when, in the introduction, the guy who compiled the stories said that Jewish tales ""in point of inventiveness can vie with the <i>Arabian NIghts' Entertainments</i>, and in ideality and moral elevation far surpass them"", but I thought... maybe it was just a passing dickhead remark by some bitter contemporary compiler-of-stories and did not signal anything about the contents of the actual narratives. OH HOW WRONG I WAS.

The <i>very first sentence</i> in the <i>very first story</i> goes thus: ""Tangier is held by the Moors to be the most beautiful city of the European hemisphere, and their patriotic conceit is explained by the circumstance that very few of Moslem birth go to the trouble of crossing the Strait to look even at the great fortress of Gibraltar.""

...I'll just let that sink in a moment. Right. Okay. So at this point I am like ""fml"" but I kept reading that one for a couple of pages just in case. The narrator goes on and on about how fucking great Gibraltar is for a while, and then circles back to Tangier, stating that ""During nine months of the year the climate along the Moorish coast facing Spain is delightful. Yet, notwithstanding the benignity of the skies and the fertility of the soil, man vegetates here in squalor, poverty, and ignorance, the historic trinity of Oriental barbarism.""

A few lines later it refers to the ""superstition, fanaticism, and indolence"" which are ""common plagues of unenlightened Islam"". I HATE EVERYTHING.

By that point I had progressed rapidly through shock, disbelief, anger, and offense, and landed squarely in <i>""oh my god I can't believe I am holding this book in public""</i>. Really most of my feelings, though, can be summarized as <i>let down</i>. How hard is it to find interesting historic and cultural artifacts or information about the group of people whose culture I share without encountering offensive bullshit like this? Can I please get some Jewpride WITHOUT the side order of horrible anti-Islam rhetoric? FOR FUCK'S SAKE. 

I did try to read some of the other stories which DIDN'T have stuff about Islam in them but they were just trite boring morality tales about people building giant fire-breathing iron golems to kill other people. Which might have been somewhat interesting (we all know how much I like golems and over the top apocalyptic ~REVENGE!!!~ nonsense) but it was just bitter and uninteresting. And it takes a lot to make me disinterested in golems. TRULY.

I am so disappointed, you guys. Why weren't these humorous folktales about wise Rabbis telling townsfolk to invite goats into their houses or about poor men going to banquets and pouring soup into their boots??? WHERE ARE THE AMAZING JEWISH FOLKTALES OF MY YOUTH :( :( :( 

So fuck this, the next book about anything remotely Jew-related I read will be <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Hebrew-Republic-Secular-Democracy-Enterprise/dp/0151014523/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1286936512&sr=8-1"">this one</a>. It probably doesn't have golems, but you cannot win them all."

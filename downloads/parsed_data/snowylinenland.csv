"event","Noted lest I forget:
It was a weekend of making out with 4 people.
- the gay work colleague (oops)
- the visiting friend from Canada
- J, who needs a name, and who's either deliberately managing my expectations, or just not fussed enough to respond more quickly than once every 24/48 hours to an email - but who is comfortable and companionable and hot and brain sexy and a source of new ideas (but who doesn't drink this year, or eat dairy, or own more than 1 plate, or, seemingly, have had sex for years before me, or - if I'm being realistic - really want me in his life, despite the fact that I see him as a very good prospective partner)
- the student at the birthday party on Friday night, the kissing outside the bar, the raked fingernails, the hairpulling, the rimming in an alley in a far southern neighborhood til a voyeur (a voyeur!) found us and asked if he could masturbate while watching. This one, yes, this one I should write back and make a date with.

And J I see tonight, hopefully for a bit more clarity on what sort of person I allowed myself to pin hopes to."

"event","Dealing with Echo's relative lack of expressions of desire has been tough - I've been mirroring what I perceive his mood to be, which is usually not-sexy. The discussion we had yesterday - that he is desirous of me, and would take very little when we're entwined to nudge him to fully turned on - was very helpful. Because he does respond beautifully, if inconsistently, to my attempts to make out with him.
Things he's identified as turning him on: 
- kissing him with intent
- hairpulling (hard, so much harder than I would want for myself)
- biting
- expressions of lust for his person at that moment

So given this list, what I need to do is be excited to see him, be excited for the sex we will have, make sure that it happens despite the many shared attractions of the rest of the world, and then make sure more happens - because based on yesterday afternoon, I would have pounced the bejesus of out of him yesterday evening.
The discovery of something good like that encourages me to want significantly more.

Perhaps also: let's drink less, no matter how nice it is.

So if in the future I can trigger mutual lust by being lustful at him, then I should.  More experience and more familiarity should then also help ensure the results are their own reward.

The next step after this: Echo psychology. Discover the physical buttons and psychological levers to play with him, toy with him, the way he does so want to be toyed with.


-

Except for the aggression while biking, he is such a comfortable pleasure to be with."

"event","Thoughts about hanging out with R Sunday and today:

It feels as though R's game for anything I suggest: I can lead him anywhere, and with him following, there isn't anywhere I wouldn't consider going.
It's a delicious dynamic.
Sunday: wandering through ankle deep mud on the marshes to pick nettles for nettle soup
Wednesday: pizza and wine in the centre of a cold, dark innercity park, eventually culminating in kissing, groping, fingering, and a short blowjob in the centre of the park. Next time, I'll be dressed for very discreet fucking there."

"event","Most of this was dealt with via paper journalling, but I spent this past weekend in a foreign city with someone I've developed an 'I want to be you' crush on, at least aesthetically, but who I enjoyed hugely just because he's him.
Things noted:
- the last time I spent 3 days straight with someone I was this excited about, and this intimately involved with, and had this much sex with, was in 2011.
- the sex bit matters hugely. We had 7 sexual encounters (most involving multiple orgasms for both of us) between Friday night and Monday morning. So much appetite for each other. Sleeping spooning and touching; rolling over in the morning to kiss and cuddle and fuck; coming home at night to fuck some more. 
- Casual anal sex! Hurrah for casually, massively experienced partners.
- Massively cheery mood throughout despite only intermittent food: I was running on orgasms. Such powerful mood regulators. 
- Sore abs from the sex; my wistful realization that since L, I haven't had abs like this because I haven't had anyone with this sort of access, matched sex drive, and sheer lustfulness in my life. (I broke up with L in 2011.)
- Dancing. We spent one night partner dancing together. This had felt fairly casually about adventure and sex, and then that happened, and for me, at least, that suddenly felt way more personal, emotional, intimate.
- Most of our sex was without condoms. I've been lax about that recently, which needs to stop, since I apparently regard it as being emotionally significant. I feel bonded to this dude now, which isn't helpful in any way (nor do I believe it's meaningfully reciprocated).
- the lack of verbal feedback on his emotional perception of our interactions isn't actually ok; his comms do a lot of the undermining of my crush (that needs to happen anyway). Gameboy this morning, by contrast, is full of lovely, turning-on words about how much he enjoys me, and being together, and what he thinks of our relationship - and the effect is that I feel I know exactly where I stand, and how to play with him better, and feel immensely safe and comfortable in our friendship.
- I want this sort of comfortable companionship in my daily life. To be less solitary, and more comfortably accompanied by someone I want to fuck like this, who wants to fuck me like this. This is a perfectly sensible thing to want to chase, build, pursue."

"event","Strangest thing about Trouble being gone from my life: on Monday, I still had someone in it who I enjoyed immensely, who was a font of new ideas and energy and experiences, who enjoyed spending time with me and thought I was someone special. Also: huge amounts of physical contact and sex. Also: a huge sense of potential for more interesting things. 
And it's very odd to have that disappear with one email.

"event","It's probably time I wrote about J, since that hasn't happened yet. I met him on the 12th, which is less than 3 weeks ago. Meeting him has been fairly intense - the depth of my comfort around him, the easy familiarity (certainly with his body) suggests a much, much longer relationship.
J's easily the highest octane person I've ever been involved with. He's ferociously intelligent, warm, social and very, very personable. He's tactile, sensual like I am - we tend to spend our time together touching each other, a lot. From the start, fucking him has felt intensely intimate, as if we're trying to have bonding sex. Lots of gentle touching while staring into each other's eyes. Our kink seems to mesh. There's been a discussion (and some practice) of going bareback with each other since the day we met, when I took him home.
And the other high octane part: it doesn't sound as if he's ever had a single relationship that ended amicably - it sounds like he normally travels through people's lives as an emotional wrecking ball. He's probably earning an order of magnitude more than I was last year, and consumes accordingly. And this is before you get to the hedonism: the nearly daily drug use, the partying. Both of the latter feed my own 'let's try everything' tendency, so our time together tends to feel creative, spontaneous, energetic, adventurous and exploratory.
And my intuitive, gut feeling is to trust him with my physical safety. I'm entirely, wholly safe with him. I'm just not safe emotionally from him. It's an interesting tension.
The result? 
We've evolved a dynamic where we try to show each other new things, either in the city or in life. He's 15 years older than me; it feels like he has a headstart. I've lived in this half of the city for four years now, and know so much more about it than him, a recent transplant. We're both plugged into different worlds culturally, so have a different list of lectures and events to go to. Both interested in learning, experiencing.
And he's decided that he'd like to push my horizons, which is the flip side of my decision that I liked that he would push my horizons.
New things tried so far:
- ketamine
- Hitachi magic wand
- nitrous
- e-stim buttplug
- a really intense scene involving my being blindfolded, restrained, the e-stim buttplug, feathers(?) and ice cream, pinching, slapping, a vibrator and the magic wand, and lots of finger fucking, kissing, sensory overload.
That's in 2.5 weeks.
What I don't want: for this to evolve into a non-balanced power dynamic. It already feels like there's a potential for that to happen, for it to settle into an older, wiser, more experienced dom with a willing pupil.
Fuck that.
My exit condition, I suppose, will be the day it feels like he's not learning from me, or no longer wants to. That's when this will tip into massively unequal, and I don't want to be in that relationship. Especially not with him.
I'm also concerned I won't be able to keep up with him, but that's something that will become clear (or not) over time, rather than right now.
For the moment, there seems to be mutual excitement at each other, comfort, sensual pleasures, and adventures to be had. The trick will be to keep the excitement proportional - already, I suspect I've been more articulate about the way I enjoy his company. If he's not exactly onboard there (his joke yesterday about my being 'an old romantic'), then this could be a problem. I refuse to be another in the series of ladies who've just fallen for him.
And so long as I'm playing with the power dynamic, discovery of more things that make him a hopeless jelly would be good.
---
Thought: I currently have a sex life (a rollicking, many-partnered sex life), but no love life. I've always been for disaggregating the two, but having someone in my life who I would want for my love life (and J is too unreliable, too clearly looking for something other than what I am) would be a good start."

"event","On the plus side, I got to make out with two different people Thurs and Fri, and Gameboy and I have decided over Friday lunch that our friendship probably can stretch to include sex, as a cosy, friendly, comforting thing, which is very exciting indeed.  I'm home the next few weeks, and would like most of all to see about setting up more casual sexual encounters, more people to be interested in getting to know, to explore, more people to be excited about in a post-S London life.
And I hope to go to a playparty on Sat, which should be very good for getting my flirt on, and hopefully my lust on.
The plan is to rewire my interest in fucking strangers - whittle down the need for an intellectual/emotional attraction, and enjoy the sensuality."

"event","So the missing him is real; masturbating to his text messages yesterday was incredibly fucking hot, but left me bereft. Devastated.
All of the not voraciously devouring, cataloguing, possessing, collecting every remaining scrap of our time together - yesterday afternoon was when I finally had that impulse. The need to write down the words he used (""when you give me those big kisses"", ""I want to have angry sex with you""), some memory of comfort and ease in everything, including walking to the gas station together Tuesday night for food, the feel of his forehead against my cheek as we stroke and rub but do not kiss - all these were wonderful, and could make me crazy possessive. 
Instead, I sound trite to myself.
The best way to deal is - as discussed with S - to view this as a grieving process. To fill my life with things that don't touch on him, for which he has no context.  And really, it's easy, because he does have no context in my life; there's never been any Simon-shaped space in my life, although all our wandering through the city centre has changed my psychogeography there.  Biking along the river bank to fly to him Wednesday night felt meet and just - that's where we wandered the first time we met.  It felt appropriate that the relationship should end with my passing through there as well.
Insofar as this has ended.
The correct way to mourn is to create a new present, locating the missed person in the past. Eventually you'll fill your life up without them.  Each text we exchange, especially the ones in which casually and glancingly reference the emotions we're having, undoes that.  Him telling me he misses me, and apologising for it.  That doesn't help.
Hopefully he'll get busy and stop talking (I don't actually hope this), as that would be one of the easiest ways to deal. A slow tailing off and slipping away and scabbing over.
I can fill my life without any problems - it's the private memory of Simon in the interstices, the wild joy at interacting with him - it's this that needs to fade. To somehow transition him to flirty friend, that one-time four-night-stand, rather than that person I fell for (how hard?) who's now very far away. 
Or better yet: to have the memories obliterated by a wild love affair with someone just as or more compelling. That would be best.  Can you get on it, universe?

Housemate says I have a different air about me - something has absolutely changed. She thinks it's happiness."

"event","1) Broke up with G on Wednesday, due to the opportunity costs of our never-amazing, always comfortable mismatch.
2) Lovely weekend as always with D, including one oral/vaginal session which definitely saw me come, oh, 7 times? D's wonderfully bloodyminded about that, and I love being puddly orgasmic mush in his oh-so-clever hands (and tongue and cock.)  We've evolved into something very comfortable; I believe we slept about 20 hours together this weekend.
3) Brought home a random last night - a 99% match on OkC. He's tribe - an intuitively good fit socially and culturally, a bit like coming home. Unexpectedly ferocious, devouring make outs - hands everywhere gripping, kissing as if necessary for breathing.  Very very hot, and plugs in with my kinks perfectly.  We're less well-matched in bed, however - I get the impression he gets off on foreplay, and then actually gets off within minutes when there's penetrative sex involved.  It was a bit disappointing, though I don't think we're actually incompatible - I could probably get off on his style of foreplay if I were more aggressive about ensuring it was mutually masturbatory, or if I could slow him down enough to focus on me and where I'm at (slower than where he was, and, surprisingly, gentler.)
We'll see if he ever writes me back; we'd verbally mentioned meeting up again sometime next week.
But hurrah for the spontaneity of bringing a random home with me, and hurrah for what was easily the most world-consuming kissing I've had in 2013 (and possibly 2012.)  Hurra for meeting people who could actually be dangerous to my equilibrium; who do conceivably have lifelong potential, rather than just this month.
Now: bedtime again, to catch up on sleep lost last night."

"event","Crystallizing a sexual encounter with my Oglaf boy this weekend, some ongoing peculiarity with G, and a chat with the Canadian:

<i>I think I want my lovers to know they're mine, wholeheartedly.  To recognise that in me, they've got something fucking wonderful, and when they're with me, it will be fucking amazing.  That interesting things will deliberately and purposefully happen (even if that's through creating the space for well-resourced spontaneity.)</i>

The Canadian gets this; my impression is still that I'm one of the few people allowed to totally bully him into doing things that are good for him, that he's comfortable being utterly silly and confused around, because it's safe.
G is way way more subby than I'm used to, but I suspect that if we continue as at present, he will get it.  I suspect I need to back off a bit from an emotional escalation perspective (and my travel schedule will do that automagically), but looking at the way we interact together, the levels of intertwined mutual care demonstrated, and the things he's learnt or started doing since meeting me (that he wasn't initially) - I do suspect this thing has legs.*

<i>And in return, I want someone to rough me up, to hold me down, to playfight with me in bed. Toss me around physically out of love because I enjoy it, and I know you want it just as much as I do.</i>

This comes from fucking D again this weekend, and noticing just how incredibly turned on I am when he pins my elbows down while eating me out, my arching up to be closer to him.  And Sunday, just how enormously, gushingly wet I got when he flipped me on to my stomach, stuck his massive cock into me, pushed my legs shut, twisted my arms behind my back so I could play with his nipples while he fucked me, each rockhard thrust ramming my buttplug as well.  Being pinned under him while he fucked me and pulled me towards him by my hair, holding me at the throat was fucking hot; my nipples are hard writing about it now.  This despite one of my shoulders being far too stiff to bend, and the throatgrabbing being on the edge of a hard boundary (breathplay is not a thing I'm into.)

And this takes me to G, whose ass I've been finger fucking and recently dildo fucking (and hope to peg soon, and oh my how good my fingers feel in his ass), and who doesn't do pain at the minute (giving or receiving).  Based on how much better the sex we're having is for me (he's gotten much better at rhythms that work for me; initially he seemed almost random, with frequent changes), I have high hopes I can teach him that this is also something I like, and that I will respond very well to the occasional bite or push. Curiously, based on the dynamic we have, I think this will still have to be within a context in which I take the initiative - in which I make sure things happen for him sexually, or in which I am the one directing the sexual experience.  This does seem to be what gets him going, though I'd love to know more about the psychology of what's pushing his buttons.

I think he appreciates my desire for some mutuality, but that's it not quite what's most effective for him.  We recently had a night where, at his request, I poured syrup all over him, and licked some of it off, and washed the rest.  He indicated that he liked the mess, but that it was much less functional (more sticky) than anticipated.  My next adventures in that direction will probably be other messy things that are less predictable (port and candlewax, taking me back literally a decade to Wren.)  He's also indicated an interest in the squirminess of unexpectedly encountering a filthy photo of him in a public place, say the internet - which means I should get my camera fixed, and ponder how to interrupt sex to take filthy photos of him.  (Talk about a statement of power...but then, I suspect my fucking his ass with a dildo was as well for him?  I need him to talk more.)

*G: didn't like people breathing on him the first night we slept together.  We were allowed to spoon briefly while awake, and then had to separate.  He's now started sleeping, oh, 15 cm from me - at least, that's where he is when I wake up - and he's no longer waking up in the night, while I still am with him."

"event","Finally, I spent yesterday mooching about with the Canadian, and confirmed (again, still) that my main response to him is just joy and lust.  I do enjoy him so, and he doesn't seem to mind my company (if him finding excuses for me not to leave are any evidence...)
The contrast between my interest in him (and joy in spending time with him, and the flirt I get on when we hang out), and nearly everyone else by contrast is...illuminating.  There's people I could fuck in my life, but none who get me buzzing quite the way he does, even now.  I'll soon be reaching the point where I'd like some physical contact now already please, and a short survey of who's currently in my life suggests that it's going to have to be with someone I'm not interested in like that.
This is disappointing."

"event","Oh, and G is now number 32.  I'd like to think that has potential, (it felt like there was chemistry!) but our contact is too infrequent for intimacy, and possibly too infrequent for desire on my part.  The situation with the other lady is also alienating me; my plan is to buy Tweetbot so I can actually mute all her tweets relating to her lovers, because if I'm right that he's one of them, then I really don't need that level of information at all.
We do sleep disastrously together, which could be a dealbreaker in itself."

"event","Since my evening plan (G) has been postponed, the obvious course of action this afternoon after catching up on all of the Oglaf was to rub out a quick one myself. 
Two related thoughts:
1) I'm about to wash my sheets - I love how cum stained they are.  It's all from masturbation (sadly), but the traces of my frequent pleasure are all there.
2) The thoughts that made me come today? Being restrained and promised that I would now be fucked by four separate people - and the squirmy knowledge that there's nothing I can do but enjoy the ride As. Much. As. Possible.
Bit subby, that.  But oh! What a quick orgasm."

The one I've been flirting with gently (quietly, gently, apparently successfully) since July, but who's too socially valuable to actually do anything with (which he agrees with.)  The one I've been coaching on how to be better at poly since July , and who I've listened to carefully as he discusses his recent forays into the kink world, and exploring how that's working for him...listened carefully as he's explained just how fucking compatible he'd be with me sexually if only he knew.  And have said NOTHING, because he's off limits, and it's simply not useful for him to know.
Fuck, he was fun to kiss.
Also, yes, there will be more kissing, and probably some fucking if we can discuss a way to get me comfortable with the fact that he apparently falls for anyone he fucks.  (Which, um, not acceptable given that we both agreed the other should be off limits.)
Currently, however, I'm a little bit giddy from a deliciously gropey make-out session in my hallway, and from the knowledge that someone does want to kiss me, seemingly quite a bit.  Someone I rather like, too.  That's exciting.
--
And tomorrow: my second date with G, the man who after last Wednesday's first date had me stuck on The Beards' ""You should consider having sex with a bearded man"" for the next two days.  His way with words has me craving more; he's managing playful; fantastically, unexpectedly witty; ever so flattering.  I'm rather excited for this, too.
G's segue into kissing last week, when I presented him with a conversational fork and asked him to pick which he was more interested in: ""well, on a continuum of interest from [this] to [this] - because I'm interested in everything - what I'm most interested in is what it would be like to kiss you.""
*melt*
So we did.
I spent Thurs-Sat completely starstruck about G, more than a bit of a crush, and then talked myself down by Sunday (after a weekend with D&L, including lots of lovely L kisses, and some quite intense being fucked in the ass by D, including my having an awesome clitoral orgasm while his pornstar cock was as deep in my ass as I was comfortable with.)
But back to crushland, his texts this afternoon have been quite flattering, so...yeah.  Warm fuzzy glow off him as well.  And hopefully even more of one tomorrow - the place we're meeting is conveniently close to his house.  (And I'm, damnably, on my period - Gameboy offered to stay tonight as well, and I chose to send him home, both like a responsible adult who knows he's off limits, and like a lazy person who doesn't want to deal with the mess, and any possible hangups about mess, the first time.)
---
Finally, Simon actually communicated interest, in a series of drunken texts Friday night.  Also someone I first met in July, and also someone who, like Gameboy, I suspect would be a lot of fun to fuck.  Also, not my highest priority at the moment (as G is will hopefully live up to all my crushing expectations tomorrow, and continue to be properly shiny, while it would be lovely to continue in some way with Gameboy, and thus declare that out of our systems - though if I'm being realistic, I doubt that would happen.  More realistic would be that we agreed we were adults, and that we're off limits to each other, and we'll seal it with a long kiss.)"

I'm going to assume it's either because I fucked a dude with a lovely beard on Sat (at a sex party, which was going to be its own entry), or just because my brain pings on random while dreaming, and there's not much I can do about it.  I do wish my brain hadn't given me this dream, however, especially the details about my dad's penis.

"event","Fucking Canadian. (In tones of exasperation, as ever.)
I had my relationship chat with him (via IM) - his best answer for why he decided to stop dating me was that the bad/no sex was making him feel awful (yup, me too), and the anticipation that saying goodbye to me would be too much to deal with, given that he was still upset from saying goodbye to his entire life in Canada.  And that he then got busy and fucked up communicating this to me, and that he should have realized this wasn't the way to do it (no SHIT.)
Anyway, I think we're sorted now - he's said very clearly that I did nothing wrong, and he doesn't hate me, both of which have been super reassuring to hear, if hyperbolic in the extreme. He's under instructions to give me any feedback he comes up with, though I'm not holding my breath.
We may even meet up again at some point, though I won't have time til after I get back from D's wedding in 10 days."

"event","I have just emailed the Canadian asking him to have a chat with me at some point about why we broke up, because I still don't know when/why he lost interest/quit me as a priority/what went wrong (or not?) from his perspective.  And I'd like some feedback, in some way, because this has been one of the most amorphously unsatisfying, intangible but stressful breakups I've ever had - feeling unwanted and forgotten sucks, and if I can possibly avoid it in the future, I will.
And even now, the emotion writing my very short, very neutral note has unleashed has me incredibly tense and shaking.  Because we now interact on a daily basis as if we're friendly, and I could easily* be friends with him - but knowing why we're not dating is important to whether I want to be friends with him.  Because I may very well not, based on the way he's dealt with this, no matter how brilliantly we have gotten along in the past.
--
My own insight of earlier this week: categorizing my lovers, some have been for fun, and some have been for intensely serious real.  The fun ones I don't fall in love with; the for real ones I'm exceptionally picky about, and then exceptionally loyal.  And from the start, I think T wanted/needed to be treated as for fun; he's only here for a short while, he's in the middle of enormous personality shift/maturation/change (though I suspect he'll only really become aware of how much he's changed when he goes back to Canada in December), and dating someone seriously is probably just not what he wanted.  I certainly don't think he wanted me in his life.**  The bit that makes me bitter, the bit I probably never communicated to him, is that he pushes enough of my buttons that he did veer into real - without pushing them especially well, or without pushing all of them.  This was always a relationship that was going to get better (I sincerely hoped) or fizzle out (what happened). For my own priorities, I would rather have 8 months of torrid love affair than not, and I was ready with a lot of my time, energy and attention to make that happen. And he wasn't.
Main plan for now: focus carefully on the fun and real categories. Perhaps make a point of seeking out someone real who wants to BE someone real for me; I suspect that would make me much happier in the long run than all the for-funs put together. That sense of being loved up I got with H and L is unbeatable for my joie d'vivre, health and self-esteem, and that's worth chasing. Insofar as I have a 10 year plan (I don't), finding a long term partner is part of it, the sort of person I could potentially even want to spawn with. (This is the first time I've ever put /that/ on paper! But this morning was the first time I've ever felt the need to take a pregnancy test, so hurrah for more firsts...)
So yes, more for funs in my life (always), but make sure the categories are, and stay, very very clear.
Especially to me.

And then I dreamt about him just now.  A roadtrip through mountains with him, one of his friends, and some random person of mine (family?), and moved by the mountains, overcome by my proximity, or whatever implausible reason, we ended up snuggling the whole way, him reaching out to hold me, me stopping to stroke him - sharing lots of moments.  In my dream, he wanted me again.
Oh brain, why?  This is super unhelpful.  I know I really rather liked him; I know he's checked out of my life without telling me why; I know there was a giant stew of hurt and rejection and longing...and I thought I'd moved on even slightly from that.  Regained some poise and equanimity, armored myself with all the reasons why dating him was terrible for me, and decided that not dating me was his loss, his problem that his walnut brain couldn't handle emotions.
Please don't do this again, brain?  Because I'm not sure I can handle too many more of these dreams.  I don't want to have to. 

(c.v. my nightmare night in Troyes, dreaming about being eaten up with jealousy over him and blond Charlotte.  My brain's giving me far more dreams about my concerns about him than it ever did when I was with him.)

"event","So through a process of both becoming distracted and (re)infatuated with others, I've functionally lost both of my boys.
The Canadian I dumped on July 5 for making me feel more unvalued, more like a doormat, an unwelcome distraction, an encumbrance, than anyone else in my life in a long time.  I'd initially been quite kind about it (""It just doesn't feel like we're dating anymore, dear; let's maintain course and speed but not call it that""), and then firmer as he got worse (as his job got busier).  The final straw was him cancelling on me 2.5 weeks ago, the only day I had to see him for the foreseeable, and before his friend from home arrived to visit (the one he didn't introduce me to), because he'd spent an evening with a work colleague and was so incandescently happy about it.  He's finally gotten around to telling me this morning that he had a wobble last week when he realised he had a crush on work colleague - but I could have told him that.
I've spent the last 3 weeks trying to get myself the fuck over him; finally successfully by Tuesday this week.  He hit so many items on my list of things I find attractive, but loving me and fancying the pants off of me are the two entirely non-negotiable items on that, and he's failed at both.
I've mentally been composing a list of the attributes he did hit today, all those buttons that had me entirely fascinated with him in Jan and Feb; I'll write it down eventually.  The short of it is that when a person independent and self-contained as a cat chooses you, that's the most flattering feeling in the world.  He is, and he tolerated me/enjoyed the attention, but he didn't choose me...and I think that's a huge part of the problem.  Chasing unavailable girls at work means no emotional jeopardy, and more value to the prize.  My offering myself to him is a meaningless offering, because he didn't want it.  And from a my needs perspective, him being unable/unwilling to tell me he liked me (words of affirmation), and increasingly, spend time with me (quality time), or have sex with me....this is a terrible mismatch for my needs.  I needs someone to fuck with joy, and again, who fancies the pants off of me and wants badly to spend more time with me.
Other thought from earlier today: I need someone who's an ethical slut, with a focus on both the ethical (so not L from last year), and slut (having a libido and ferocious appetite for me, unlike T).
And then I had a long discussion with D tonight, who I haven't spoken to in weeks, and who hasn't had time for me either (and who I don't have another date with planned at all anytime soon.)  He's disappeared off the face of my planet (no responses anymore on FB or Twitter to anything; my impression is that he only knows what happens in my life because L tells him), I'd assumed because of the Lisa fascination, but it sounds like it's just L (or so he's saying), and he and L's joint love life taking off, including L's approaching of many more new people who are local to them.  This is all super good for him, and I'm happy for him...but it does feel like the appropriate response for me is going to be to fade out of his life politely.
...
Right, I've just actually checked with D if he actually wants me at his wedding, given the overall lack of comms, and the answer seems to be yes.  He's apologised for being so out of touch; he's just been really really busy, and neglecting many things.
The current plan: try to have more frequent short interactions...which frankly, sounds like the Twitter D's no longer doing, or the FB comments he's no longer leaving.
But eh.  We'll see how this goes.
At the moment, attending his wedding is going to be a logistical nightmare.
...
But feeling single here, without T, is going pretty well.  It's opened up the possibility of feeling desirable and desired again, which he hasn't caused me to feel in a long time, if ever.
Next: using the map T's provided me with to find my own lover (""I am not your lover, I'm the map you use to find him""), and being true to myself when a tentative reality checks suggests that my needs aren't being met and aren't likely to be met anytime soon.  Not compromising."

D and I have a phonecall planned for Thurs, and saw each other at the weekend.  He's currently full of wedding plans, and excited about the new person in his life - it feels as if by comparison, I'm just familiar and comfortable...which is probably true, and not in any way wrong.  But no longer shiny, which is...slightly disappointing? I miss it, in any case.  Or miss being that excited myself.  Or envious - I want him to leave hickies like the one on him on me, which he's never done (possibly because when we're together, I'm the one driving how we interact, even when he pulls my button down shirt halfway down my back to pin my elbows together while we fuck, which is ever so hot for both of us.)
In my most self-pitying, I would put it as the sense that nobody is that excited about me - nobody wants me, nobody misses me, nobody loves me.  But this is complete bullshit; I know it is.
I had an absolutely lovely dinner with T tonight, which I had expected would be a full night, but which came out better for him as a full night tomorrow.  We parted with quite wonderful kisses; I had ""It's in his kiss"" stuck in my head the whole way home.  But he's quite simply not fascinated with me the way I have been with him*, and I'm not sure what to do about it.**  Adding more romantic-y people is probably not helpful; adding more people to my life in general, however, probably would be.***  
Using now to continue to focus on work, which I had always planned for now, and on the friendships I have, and maybe on meeting new people as a source of new ideas and energy...this would probably be helpful.


*This is really the problem, and I don't think it's fixable.  He'd rather watch television than read a link I've sent through to him; I'm simply not the priority.  Essentially, I think I'm trying to date a bachelor who humors me in it, but who fundamentally feels no matching impulse to try to date me.  He likes me most of anyone he likes, and that's quite a bit, but that's fundamentally not saying much.
**Nevermind the dealbreaker of no sex.  This is serious, unfortunately - like my seasonal affective disorder.  Bicycling and extra lightbulbs are the solution to the SAD; I'm feeling this as just as keen a lack.  Next up: somehow presenting this to the Canadian?  Or ending my relationship with him?  This sucks; I do enjoy him so when we're together...but it's so rare.  Maybe thinking of him as a second LDR, but with less helpful scheduling and less ability to vocalise his emotions would help?  Except then we have days like today, where he was in touch quite frequently throughout the day, and in an absolutely sunny mood when he saw me.  (""At the end of the day, I realised I'd accomplished quite a lot, so I thought I would treat myself to dinner with a cute girl.""  It makes me melt, in part because it's meant so warmly, and in part because it's infrequent.)
***Fitting deed to the word, I've just emailed a fellow on OKC who I had a professionally fascinating conversation with; meeting new people who might be professionally inspirational is surely one way of dealing with this...as will be meeting new people in general.  Momentum!  Like a fucking shark."

Holiday together:
-So many cuddles!
-I have a faster fuse than him when it comes to wanting another hug, another kiss.  Touch me, touch me now! But he does also reach for me, plant a kiss on my head when I come wandering back.
-Strategyish idea? Don't overwhelm him with my timetable, but wait for his timetable to be activated? This should fit in better with how he likes sex (greatest disappointment of the holiday; we tried once, no success ""I hate being defensive about this.  This is so embarrassing""), and I tried to jump him once, which did not work either (""um, hello?"")
-He fucking got an erection while fondling my breasts at the bus stop when saying goodbye to me - so clearly he does get them...and does enjoy my breasts?  Is that what I should take from this?
-Next time we find ourselves in a sexy mood, denial and long long play (and oral sex), are what I'll be chasing. And when it falls apart (inevitably), the goal will be to parlay it into other sexy activities, not a discussion of T's failings or even, hey, his emotions. Like I said, I want a sexual relationship with him, and there's a lot of sexual things in the world that aren't penetrative sex.
-When I'm tired or sad or distressed, apparently my nickname is 'muffin'. I like it.
-We travel exceptionally well together; calm each other when the other's distressed, joke and herd and amuse each other.  This was a delight to discover; I'd been incredibly nervous about it beforehand.
-I've explained the languages of love to him; it'll be interesting to see if he comes back to me with more information about his preferences.

"event","Lovely lovely D.
Just had him for a weekend, my birthday weekend, and it was as incredibly hot, delicious, and just super super comfortable as always, as ever.  We laugh, we joke all the time, we talk, and oh oh oh do we fuck.  This weekend especially has involved a lot of talking about us and the quality of our relationship, and about learning from each other sexually.  ""Just the right side of kinky"" was his description for our sex.
Most important bits:
1) Discussion about love.  We've decided it's a word we're allowed to use for each other. We may not be in love, but we do have love for each other; we're allowed to say we love each other.  It's the right term, for me, for the type of warm and fuzzy he makes me, that I feel towards him.
2) Part of the same conversation: D will be naming me as his other partner in public forums, specifically OkCupid.  This is really flattering.  Though I don't think I will do that for him (due to uncertainty of relationship with the Canadian), I will be proud to be identified as one of D's partners.  This is important.
3) Buttplug! D got me one for my birthday - the first time I've ever worn one - and it is *beautiful*.  Beautifully designed, soft squishy silicone, nice size - and very very nice to have in me while he fucks me.  I'm delighted with it, with his taste, with the gift from him to me, with having it in my toybox.  Goals for the next few weeks: acquire the right shoebox to have as a toybox to store under my bed; sew a special bag to store the buttplug in, because it deserves one.  And perhaps integrate it into my masturbation routines...
4) Nipples. D's are beautifully sensitive, but we discovered Friday that when licked and sucked and bitten (basically mouthfucked), they become *far far far* more sensitive than he ever knew - I had him as gasping putty, except his cock, which was entirely rock hard, til he begged for me to fuck him, put him inside me quick, because he couldn't stand it anymore.  In short, more of this, and also...
Because of this, while fucking today, I stopped him to put some orgasm balm on his nipples while I played with them - and he went from plain D to turbo D - it was astonishing.  Rock hard, deep very fast fucking, and he came nearly immediately.  He needs his own pot of balm, for sure - but perhaps the effect is just that of less friction on his nipples while they're played with? I love playing with my own nipples when they're slippery wet with spit, and the orgasm balm on my own nipples was a fantastically satiny friction/lubrication. 
For more exploration, possibly also while he's restrained.
5) Sexual learning goals:
D wants me to learn/me to teach him how to get him off more quickly via blowjobs, the better to facilitate spontaneous sex, which is something I really enjoy.  At the moment, D can sometimes take forever to come (if at all - this is why he's not in porn).  He used to think he didn't like blowjobs at all; mine, my first visit to his town, was the firs time he'd ever come from one. I think this will be fun.
Orgasms.  D gets me to orgasm unlike anybody else, in part because his cock is the size of my wrist and almost as long as my forearm. His cock slowly, deliberately thrusting while he he sucked my nipples today, me the focus of all of his attention, led to an astonishingly sweet vaginal orgasm this afternoon, and another a breathtakingly few minutes later with his cock bashing away at me with the buttplug in my ass, making me come in what felt like less than three minutes. Two proper orgasms this close together is unprecedented for me.  Longtime readers of this blog will know I effectively taught myself to orgasm at 22 via masturbation; if he can help me learn how to orgasm multiple times in one go, that would be wonderful - especially with how to push myself over the edge (exactly what he wants for blowjobs).  Except for the bit where the orgasms D produces are radically different in mechanism than those from anyone else (again, that gorgeous cock), just knowing more about how the various bits of my body fit together and work together would be delicious.  If I can then know enough myself to teach others how to drive me wild, that would be fantastic...
D also would like very very much to fuck me in the ass someday, which currently sounds logistically daunting (a part of me is worried about ass muscles stretched beyond the point of continence), but clearly is a huge turn-on for him (it's what he was thinking about during his turbo-D moment), so I'm game, especially give my positive experience with L last year.  But that would be something to build up to; in the meantime, there's so much more fun to be had with the current buttplug.

In conclusion, yay D!  And yay us!  And yay another wonderful weekend together.

*From the massage I gave him on Friday night, with a glittery massage bar. He responds so well to touch; he's such a joy to massage.  I love finding the glitter on him afterwards, and he enjoys my viewing him being glittered up as a mark of my ownership of him, so that's good too.  Next up: making sure I have massage bars in stock regularly.."

"event","Just had this through from the Canadian, which is I think the closest I've gotten yet to ""I really enjoy your company and really kind of like you"", even though that's the main message I get from all time spent with him.
If we have more transcendentally good days like this past Sunday (we did everything! breakfast al fresco by a lake! driving in a zippy (borrowed) sports car! shopping for his sister's wedding present! coffee in the sun! watching bike races at an open air velodrome! long walk through quiet suburbs and country! a temporary exhibit at a world class modern art museum! and then back to his in time to barbecue in the last of the evening sunshine.  Then a movie filmed in his hometown ""that's the so and so bridge!"", and sex that made him feel 'weird and tense', for which his self-proposed solution is marijuana, which I'm happy to try, if it means that the promise of him pulling me into kisses against the railing of the stairwell of the modern art museum is fulfilled with smoking hot sex later)...then I might actually fall for him. Damn but we have a good time together.
He also described something I was doing following the tense, abortive sex as 'loving strokes', which is good because that was my intention, but also good if that's how he's perceiving them...since I suppose I would say that I have an enormous amount of interest and affection for my Canadian at this point.
In conclusion, stay tuned to after our trip to Rome together at the end of the month; if it's anything like Sunday, we'll have a ferociously good time.
My goal is still for both of us to be so comfortable with each other's bodies that we have recreational sex; the emotional stuff and match up of kinks is right for it to be absolutely astonishingly good, if I can ever get him to relax enough to stay in the mood for more than 20 minutes, or to take longer than 15 minutes to come.  My solution is both more sex, and more easy, comfortable, sexy access to each other's bodies - I want him to feel confident with three different ways to make me come (and vice versa, which I don't think I have.)
To do list for Rome, clearly."

"event","First sex toys bought in YEARS arrived today!
- A set of silicone muscle toner ben-wa balls, which I can feel jingle if I hop, but not really otherwise (there's a very faint feeling of being full, but otherwise they just seem very big to me.  Same girth as my cup; bigger than T, smaller than D by a country mile). We'll see how they go - so far, they're not really sexy to me at all, but I also shoved them in sans lube, which might be part of the problem.  Equally, maybe sitting down isn't the right way to use them - stairclimbing, here I come!
I have to say, I'm slightly disappointed that I can't just wear them - apparently I still need to do kegels as well to actually get the full effect.  Ah well.  But I am excited for stronger, more sensitive vaginal walls, and better overall orgasms.
- A pot of lady's orgasm balm, to be applied clitorally.  Main goal here is to use it with T, who generally comes far far quicker than I do, to see if we can't speed me up a bit.  Eventually, I'd like to teach him to slow down a lot, and drive me batty in the process, but that may take more sexy time than I currently get with him. He does know about these purchases, and seems to have identified them as being to his benefit, so hopefully that will come out for the sexier...

Now: off to fold laundry and tidy my room; let's see these balls work their magic..."

Other thing I want: more information on his sexual habits.  Because it may be that what I want is simply not a thing he can offer - that my libido is just genuinely one order of magnitude (or more?) higher than his.

"event","Oglaf weekend.
 
Fucked 6 times between Friday and Sunday evenings.  All orgasms, including my sucking him off.  Lovely fuckathons, really.  
Also long discussions about relationships, expressions of love, jealousy, and what you look for in a relationship.
D makes me feel like the sexiest woman alive; he melts under my hands, except for when I make him so incredibly hard. 
Lovely range of things discussed as well; he's currently reading a book about making fun, which I want very much to borrow off him.
Per always, such similar metabolisms, sleep needs, sex needs.  Except for waking up to him fingerfucking me in his sleep - classic sex pest D.
Also, D is so incredibly easy to talk to, especially about emotions.  Hurrah for him being clear and open and honest, and for him being explicit about his care and feeding.

Conclusions:
-Talk to D more.  (D was jealous of my upcoming trip with the Canadian, because of my emotional availability to him - not my sexual, which I think is an interesting distinction.)
-Read Gary Chapman's Languages of Love (based on S's synopsis, I need words, damnit.  D likes being fed.)
-Talk to the Canadian about our exclusivity/STDs (and then talk to D re STDs, including asking Canadian to take an STD test)
-Talk to the Canadian again about what our relationship is and where it might be going, because while it was wonderful to see him when I came back, we failed at sex again, and I still feel hell of uncertain about him/us as an item, especially with regards to his Canadian gamer chick.  So go back to asking him to talk to me, and asking him to talk through sex with me, and asking him to just fucking communicate more about his internal monologue, because I want to know...no matter how good we are at shooting the shit and snuggling and serious conversations.

Finally, STD test of my own scheduled for Wednesday"

D, my most amazing lover, has bought me a butt plug for my birthday (currently still over a month off).  The first erotica written to incorporate the butt plug has come into my inbox yesterday, and includes some interesting bossy notes not present when I see him.  He's picked one he thinks I'd like; he's excited fucking me from behind and controlling my shoulders, holding about my neck.  He's leading this process, absolutely indubitably, and he likes it.  He likes the trust, and the authority.
Beyond my bemusement, so far I'm willing to go along.  I like him enjoying being trusted, him enjoying setting the pace.  (If the pace were not to my liking, I'd stop him, but I do trust that he will.)"

"event","I'm currently at the start of the third of three weeks away; my mother's had a serious operation, and I've come home to be with her.  Three weeks away is a long time; my dislocation and isolation here have been enormous.  It's also been something I've been worrying about before leaving, and now while gone, especially with regards to my gentlemen lovers.
D, I am less worried about - we've always been long distance, and we do know how to communicate.  The timing is not as good, though, here, and my general discomfort has spilled over into our communications, too. (Instead of engaged, excited and exciting, I'm feeling unwell, worried, narrowed in my horizons. It's an all around not-so-good-scene, with the only consolation that my mother's healing well, and this too shall pass.)
The Canadian, I am worrying more about.  We need to work out what the current shape of our relationship is after I get back, since it shifted right before I left. (We spent every spare moment together the last 3 days before I left, and it just got better.  It seems we do intense well, including breaking my bed twice for the fucking.) The discussion we had my first weekend away (me from the hospital) basically concluded that we meant whatever we are doing very seriously; our time together was *not* casual, and in a sense, nor is our intention.  
And then our communication's become haphazard. I don't have anything to report from here; he's become very busy at work.  The bit that makes me unhappy is that I know he's also looking to meet up this weekend with someone else he's interested in...and I desire some affirmation of my ongoing specialness, that I won't be replaced just for being far away*.  (Even if I'm back in 6 days now.)
What I need from him is more information on how he pursues relationships, on what the implications of our relationship are, on what I can realistically expect might happen for him meeting up with the young lady.  Would he take her home tonight if he could?  What further views on safe sex does he have? Just how excited about her is he?  None of this has been discussed face to face, since he's only introduced the concept of her after I left for this trip.
I need to rediscuss it in person.  I need to discover where we're at in person.  And I need to keep in focus that I'm currently wanting to lean on him far more than usual (due to being at my mother's), and that he's not meeting my want for huge attention (and love?) may be because that's just how he is, and that I'm normally fine with that.  That I'm not now because I'm feeling fragile, but that equally, I just don't have as much to offer right now.
My solution for today: after a peak of ""why doesn't he write me back right now?! but I want to talk to him now!"" feeling, I've written him a note giving him my best wishes/blessing for the weekend, and let him go.  He'll get back when and how he wants, and I won't need to look for it til it comes in.  It's a question of trusting that when he said on Wednesday that 'we matter' and that he missed me, it probably still held for Thursday and Friday, and will for Saturday as well. And that that's all okay.

And sleep now, because I know I'll feel better in the morning.

*The sociopath I dated last year progressed his relationships with the other women each time I left; part of the point of the current polyamoury is to be comfortable with what I'm leaving behind when I leave.  Seeing someone else when I'm away, though, is as close to a giant button as I could have - I just haven't put it to the Canadian in those terms, because I've wanted to see what would happen, and I've wanted to make it work because it should, not because the stakes are high for me."

"event","Because I didn't log it earlier, a revelation:
The Canadian got me off! On Monday night. Himself as well, of course :)
And it was splendid.

Things that did it:
- Fucking in three sessions, spread out of the course of an evening together at his. 
- Lots of discussion about how he wanted to be touched, how I wanted to be touched.  What turned on us on. ""So when I do this, this does something for you?"" ""Oh yes, yes, that does"".  This led especially to my directing him (""you should play with my nipples now, and feel how I get wetter""), and to him trying things that I told him would get me off (biting me already).
- Ferocity.  I don't know if it's our dynamic, or something he does more broadly, but my basically roughhousing with him - fighting him off, blocking him, trying to flip him over - totally totally a turn on for him.  Specifically, he gets off on pinning me down and physically controlling me...which I'm totally okay with. Which he now *knows* I'm totally okay with  as well, which may help.
- Equally, he's finally understood viscerally that I do have *quite* something to contribute - my arms on his body, grabbing his ass, guiding him in, setting the pace and changing the angle when he's on top.  When I've said I wanted him, I meant it.  That does mean buried deep as possible in me; that does mean he can pick me up and shift me, and I  will stay on his cock.  Not a problem (and totally hot).
Interestingly, I think I may have taught him something new (or just discovered with him something new about us) - that my riding him, a sexual position he stated didn't do much for him, totally does do something for him.   It's just a question of finding angles that work well for both of us, of pinning him down and kissing him, biting him, of getting his hands on my breasts. So yeah, he does like being fucked by me, despite him thinking he didn't...
- Experience? I'm probably more experienced than him (despite him having 9 years on me), and certainly in better physical and emotional shape than him. When discussing endurance/the experience afterwards, he noted that he'd figured I could 'go longer' than him, and it's true.  I do think he's got a better sense of what the advantages of that are now, though...  (That the longer he can draw it out, the slower and sweeter I'll fuck him, and the better it will get.  This became very, very clear Monday night.)
- My coming.  Only from his cock, and from being held very tightly to/around him, and from being partially crushed by his body - pushing my constraint buttons.  It bodes well, especially if it's repeatable. He said he was daunted by the notion of my needing two points of contact; I hope it becomes clear that's not something to be daunted by.
- He thinks my touching myself while he fucks me is hot, which is good, because I certainly think it's hot.
- He babbles inaudible fierce sweet nothings about how hot the experience is, how hot I am, when at the heights of ecstasy. I'd love to have been able to hear the details of what he was actually saying...  (Hurrah for finally breaking his own emotional control, though.)
- When asked what especially worked for him, one of the things he specifically mentioned was feeling emotionally close (beyond my being physically glued to him, wrapped around him, holding him as tightly/closely as I could.) This makes sense; we have an easy, comfortable relationship that's never been discussed or acknowledged as an ongoing relationship (which is my problem with the next point), but it's clear we care quite a bit about each other. We send each other 5-30 emails a day; we don't keep our hands off each other when we're together.  We're not in love, but I don't see any reason for us to stop doing what we're doing. I'm certainly still comfortably fascinated with him and the way he interacts with the world.
- no condom.  Wonder how much that actually affected this; it's certainly my preference, but slightly worrisome doing that with two people.  (Need to have a chat with D about this.) Also only something I do with partners I'm in an ongoing relationship with with huge amounts of trust.  (Will need to point this out to the Canadian, probably leading to a relationship discussion.)
- New factoid: spanking. For him, it's the sound that he likes.  I'm fairly apathetic, but since he clearly responds well to the opportunity to produce this sound, I will be encouraging him.

He's back in the country on Sunday; I leave for three weeks on Thursday. I would be thrilled if we got at least another night like this in before I go.
My other conclusion is that my boy is quite possibly just kinkier and more emotionally conservative than I was expecting - vanilla sex alone doesn't distract him enough (drive him sufficiently to a fog of lust) to avoid a freakout, while casual sex may just not be a thing he's interested in or capable of doing at the moment."

"event","Sex party again this weekend.  Took D along with me.  On my period (oh terrible timing).  Saw use of a violet wand demonstrated (beautiful); other people engaged in rope play, knife play, bondage, and lots of group sex. 
D basically didn't do anything with anyone, I snuggled, handjobbed, pulled hair and kissed.  Both of us somewhat limited by not knowing most of the people there, and me in part because I wanted to keep my underwear on (because bleeding on other people's furniture is rude). I'm not sure what would have encouraged him to engage with others; I'll need to ask him. Maybe more explicit introduction of him to other people, or discussion beforehand encouraging him to fuck others?  Maybe fewer drugs on his part?
Discovery of the evening: people fucking with my feet while I'm engaged in an explicitly sexual act (sucking off D's gorgeous beautiful cock, playing with his exquisitely sensitive nipples, teasing him with light stroking on the sensitized nape of his neck, pulling his hair, massaging his hip bones - as always, this beautiful beautiful boy is built for fucking).  Anyway, playing with my feet when I'm doing some sexy apparently transcends immediately ticklish into straight-up intense, turning-on sensation. Who knew this about my body?  Not me.  Most people sucking my toes has left me neutral.  (""That's nice, dear, and I appreciate you going near my feet at the end of the day, but please consider either massaging them or licking something erogenous."")
Gentleman in question has a foot fetish; started with stroking, licking and sucking calves, soles and toes, proceeded into full on fucking his mouth with my foot (basically giving a blowjob - wetly sucking and squishing, licking and flicking, delicate biting), and eventually to doing all of the above while scratching the soles of my feet with his fingernails.  It was the scratching that pushed the edge of my pain boundaries (he drew blood), and took this from merely pleasurable into incredibly incredibly intense. I nearly came from this, which is absolutely unheard of.  D is covered in bite marks from my response to my foot being played with; I believe he rather enjoyed my spasms with my mouth on his cock. (Other option is that he felt slightly left out of the proceedings?  It's possible; he absolutely wasn't where my attention was, though it was because of my interactions with him that the foot thing was immediately sexualised.)
The attention to my feet was at times too painful; trying desperately to wriggle my foot out of his grasp while still basically going down on D was an interesting, interesting experience.  It felt like he was drawing blood, which was beyond my pleasurable sting boundary into outrightly painful - I switched feet on him at that point. (It was very very good, but my left foot really could not take any more.)
Later: snuggled conversation with D about our relationship, my relationship with the Canadian. Very good, I think, though worth checking in with D about (again.  Also because I don't know how much of it he remembers.) Two nights of falling asleep, and sleeping through the night, spooned the lengths of our bodies.  We sleep so well together, he and I.  A comment was made at some point about us being on the same wavelength, and it feels very, very true (on so many things.  Weekends together seem to leave both of us ultra relaxed, happy and mellow and content and continuously, liquidly post-orgasmic but still lustful.)
D has learned now that I respond well to being bitten while being fucked; hopefully he'll put this to good use. Other discussion point: he feels like he's topping me when fingerfucking my ass while fucking me. He feels utterly in control, partially because of just how quickly I lose it and come - I can see why this is a turn-on for him.  Though I can just come from his cock (we did have one very sweet quickie that saw both of us coming from PIV contact only), two points of stimulation (nipples, clit or ass...or hey, maybe feet in the future?) do seem to make it much much easier. (He needs two as well, so that feels balanced).
My ass also seems to be getting more used to being a point of sexual interest - D fingerfucked me in the shower on Sunday, and that too was unexpectedly delicious (coupled only with kissing; no further contact.  Hot spray on me; he'd stepped out and dried off, with only his hands and tongue touching me.)
More BDSMy explorations intended for the future, we decided.
Finally, thoughts for some other day on submission and pushing boundaries.  My boundaries are set quite far out; they are historically been further than my partner's anyway.  And I do like pushing my partners' envelopes as well.  (Discussion with S last night* about topping from the bottom being rude; I do it because confidently stealing control, hijacking the situation to introduce new levels of awesome, is something I really really rather enjoy doing. I also don't really interact with people who would view this as rude, though perhaps I will in the future.) I do like people to outwit me, push me, restrain me - but there are very few boundaries I really fear, and an awful lot in the margin up the boundary that I do rather enjoy.  Drawing blood on my feet apparently did hit a boundary; I felt he was doing it, and that was a disconcerting sensation. He swore he wasn't; finding the scabs on my feet this morning was useful confirmation that even tipsy and distracted, I do have a sense of how intact my skin is (and how intact I'd apparently like to keep it.)
More specifically, drawing blood is one of my boundaries. J did it while going down on me at the party in December scratching my ass; at the time, it felt deliciously deliberate on his part, and I loved being marked the next few days. My feet was unintentional, but did make me uncomfortable.
Good to know, in any case.  Ditto for foot sensitivity.
Finally, D has yet to leave a mark on me; nothing like the marks I leave on him each time. He knows how much I enjoy it now; hopefully he will next time...

*I have permission to snog her rotten next time I see her, yay!  Hurrah for more kissing of girls, especially S!  I feel the need to include a row of smiley emoticons here, except I do have some taste. But yay!  :-D"

"event","Weekend of exhausted sexual glory with my Oglaf boy
New insights:
-we seem to have similar food/sleep/fucking rhythms.  Crowning joy was a mutual nap Saturday afternoon, post lunch - to bed at 13.30, awake again after 17.00.  Curled up against each other, drifting off together.
-D has proclaimed ""I'm not ashamed to say that this is the best sex I have ever had in my life"".  He's one of my best, for sure, but this also make me worry for his fiancee.
-He's discovered, which I didn't know either, that jamming one or more fingers in my ass while he's fucking me with his cock the size of my wrist (so astonishingly beautiful, this boy) that I come, pretty much instantaneously.  That I flood him, despite his size.  That I lose all my studied control of my volume, and mewl and whimper and growl.  And that if he keeps it up, I'll come over an extended period of time.
This is a massive turnon for both of us; he gets off on feeling like he's fucking me in both holes (and the way I pull him in) - I get off on pure sensation, including a very thin edge of pain due to his size.  At this rate, he will be spoiling me for sex with anyone else, ever...but I just don't want him to stop.
-I've worked out that one of the things I find really really attractive about him is a core of intensely understated self-confidence.  He doesn't really ever reference it, but it's there.  He has one past tense story of a career choice failing, and a lot of past tense stories of his body failing him (he has a chronic illness), but right now, things are going really really well for him.
-The boy makes me happy. I love his self-entertaining take on life, his efforts to interest me in Eve, to share things with me he thinks I'll like. (Japanese binocular football? Pandemic 2?  Yes.)  And I love how turned on he is by me, how beautiful he tells me he finds me, how fucking hot.
-We didn't count this weekend. It wasn't going to be necessary or pretty...after we reached 4 (or was it 5?) the first night, after I picked him up from the trainstation at 19.00
-As described to a friend tonight, ""Oh, I wore this coat to go out with D. I love this coat (which I don't wear very often); it makes me feel like a rock star.  Actually, D makes me feel like a rockstar.""
-Yuppie breakfast together on Saturday.  So so wonderfully domestic; I've missed this pace of life, the joy of fresh bagels together with your lover on the weekend.
-Comedy show on Saturday night, where we made out nonstop, and got a photo of us flashed on the main screen at some point.
-I like walking through this city hand in hand with him. I like checking him out on the bus; this most gorgeous man who's going to come home with me.
-Next up: seeing him soon. More quiet contentment, horrendously awful jokes, and a boy who brings out the darkest humor I can muster, and raises me one.  And sex that leaves me incoherent jelly, exhausted but smiling furiously, the sheets ruined.  (Sleeping on them still tonight as a trophy.)"

"event","Firstly, Europe is covered in snow.  It's snowing outside as we speak, the outside world made silent by it.  It's beautiful.
Next: the Canadian.
He paid me a compliment this morning, for the first time in the +/- 1 month he's known me. He likes my new haircut; it looks good messy in the morning.
Observed from sleeping at his last night (my train was broken; he didn't seem to mind my calling to ask if I might impose): we wake up snuggled together.  We don't roll away from each other in the course of the night.  I love it when I have this dynamic with someone, even if (as I suspect with him), it's the result of being woken up in the night to reposition, and therefore light/bad sleep overall.
He claims I grumbled at him in my mothertongue in my sleep at some point in the middle of the night, when he left to go use the toilet - and then apologized in English.  Apparently it was cute.
It's the first time in years someone's reported that I've done this; I used to do this my first year of university.  No clue what the implications of this are.
Finally, we suck at sex.  Or more specifically, he does.  Last night's unexpected end to sex? He'd managed to scrape his knees up playing basketball (how?), and then ripped them open again fucking me, and then caught sight of his own blood and freaked out. And then spent 30 minutes freaking/apologizing to me for sucking at sex/apologizing to me for sucking/beating himself up.  And then got hard again and fucked me some more, eventually leaving a serious quantity of horrorshow bloody streaks along his sheets - gory enough to disconcert me.  Maybe someday his fucking will be enough quantity wise (the quality is quite good, if inconsistent), that it'll get me off...but so far, the boy has not succeeded.  Has not really come close. A more consistent feature of fucking him is my attempting to comfort/console/soothe him after he has a freak-out over something.
Wtf.
But I do enjoy spending time with him, and his oh-so-snuggly body, and his lovely sense of humor.
But coming home wanting to masturbate, because it would be nice to get off occasionally? Disappointing.  (On that note, my plan for later tonight...)
Finally, we had a brief chat about a) what we're doing, in response to his joking 'Oh, that's my fault for dating an [my profession]'.  The answer: dating is a convenient term to refer to our ongoing relationship including intimate encounters. Emotional affirmation?  I will clearly not get it from him verbally. (Though the way he buries his face in my neck, or bumps noses with me while looking into my eyes, feels like there's some affection.)
And I've brought up the poly thing - he now knows about D in explicit terms (I'd mentioned him in passing before, without explaining my relationship to him), and I've lightly asked for him to keep me abreast of anyone else in his life, plus what role they occupy.  (D, as explained to the Canadian, is for fun, and then he gets handed back to his fiancee.)  I feel like I've made my minimum required disclosure - it would be nice if he did his.  Also, if I had more agreement from him that he would tell me of anything else going on, which he so far hasn't.  But we've affirmed the principle of both of us seeing other people, which I appreciate.
Conclusion with him for now: I enjoy that he's there.  I will continue to enjoy him when and as appears appropriate, and when he's available.  In the meantime, I would like to/need to focus on my own friends and work and life.  He's shiny, but perhaps less blinding now.  No orgasms and no ability/motivation/? to talk about his own emotional state do tarnish his shiny a bit...
Which won't stop me from touching myself while I think about him..."

"event","The Canadian just said I &quot;must be made of magic&quot;.&nbsp; I guess that&#39;s a compliment...
(Even if he still hasn&#39;t said anything about liking me personally in any way at any point; though people who&#39;ve seen us together assure me that &#39;oh, he&#39;s massively into you.&nbsp; You can just see that.&#39;)
He has been exceptionally attentive since he came back - it feels a bit like he&#39;s decided he&#39;s going to give this a go, or maybe even like he missed me...except he hasn&#39;t said that either.&nbsp; Even my &quot;I like the way you touch me&quot; got a &quot;I like the way you feel[?] my touch&quot; in response.
Sex with him continues to be not functional - two attempts yesterday (but with a good turnaround time!)&nbsp; The first, he came in &lt;5 min (disappointing, though our discussion around it was quite funny); the second, he had to stop because of pain from cracked ribs (can&#39;t say I blame him, really.)&nbsp; But he really is the best snuggler ever...so I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;ll settle for.&nbsp; Too gentle a kisser, too gentle in his touching of me, except when he picks me up and moves me to somewhere.&nbsp; (Feels like he&#39;s been very oddly socialised, which we might actually have to have a chat about at some point.&nbsp; Who both pins a partner down, pulls a partner&#39;s jaw into a kiss, flips them over...and then gives head that I can barely feel at all?)
For his part, seems he gets off on being touched very very gently, especially around his neck (oh, his ears! licking them does amazing spasmy things to his breathing), and that&#39;s as far as I&#39;ve gotten in learning about his body.&nbsp; Oh, and likes having his ass grabbed, for sure.&nbsp; His back stroked, too.
But yes: we peoplepile together very, very well.&nbsp; We kiss and nuzzle very, very comfortably.&nbsp; We fuck...less well. With chemistry...but perhaps with no context?&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the problem.
Conclusion of last night: he&#39;s fun (skilled!) to cook with.&nbsp; And he thanked me repeatedly for having him over, that he&#39;d had a wonderful time. So I guess that&#39;s okay..."

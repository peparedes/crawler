"event","haha until stephen sent me a link to his, i forgot i even HAD one of these things. funny, my last update was right before worlds last year! OMG im so excited, im just starting to pack some things right now. Then tomorrow, i will take a train to rockville centre, then me and alex are off to FINLAND for the WORLD FUCKING FOOTBAG CHAMPIONSHIPS FUCKERS!!!!!! im competing in net and freestyle this year, wahoo! its gonna be a blast...our friend cheebs is going too, and a few other americans. i dont know if i can even sleep tonight, oh well. i dont even care, wtf. 

today was a great last day at home, too. i went to point pleasant beach in jersey with my mom, dad, uncle wimmy, barbara, her sister darlene and her husband bobby, and their adopted daughter julie (shes so cute!). julie won me a little stuffed animoo of brian from family guy out of a crane machine, and she was so excited to give it to me, haha it was great. shes like 5 or something..i forget.

the water was REALLY rough, but lots of fun. at one point it was just me and my dad swimming and then he went in for awhile. then i saw this gorgeous girl who kept looking over at me from a distance. so i swam my ass off against the currents and made it to her, lol. i knew she was european from the second i saw her, and we started talking. turns out she just moved to jersey from the slovak republic, and has been to the czech republic many times, so we were talking about that a lot. she was such a sweet girl, and man...so sexy. like wow...like WOWIE wow, if you know what im sayin, haha! plus i have a thing for that euro-look, its great. well anyway i was getting really thirsty so i had to go in for some fresh water, and i told her id be right back out.

so i get my drink, blah blah blah, go back out into the ocean and i cant find her!!! so i start scanning the beach for pink bikinis on slovak hotties and i dont see any!!! i was pretty disappointed.

anyways, we're about to leave because i wanted to come home and practice some footbag, so i walked out near the water one last time, and i saw her walking along the shoreline alone and im just like ""SLOVAKIA! SLOVAKIA!"" lol, i probably sounded like such a dork, but oh well. i never got her name, so we formally introduced ourselves and her name is DANA! Daaaanaaaaaaaaaa... ::drools some::. we talked a little bit more and when i told her i had to leave she looked a little sad. so i hugged her and she gave me a kiss on the cheek, which was so nice! i think that little peck was better than sex. i really like her, and ever since i left shes all i keep thinking about. too bad she lives like an hour from me though...but, ill deffinately see her again.

im still baffled by the fact that 24 hours from now ill be over the atlantic ocean. awesome...OK maybe when i come back ill start posting more, who knows? i'll keep ya guessin! FUCKIN WORLDS FUCK RIGHT DAMNIT BITCH HOE ASS BUTT BALLS COOCH ASS SHIT FART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BAHHHHHHHHhhhhosiadfh0wager8qgwd80g3208tdgsad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ... :-)

"event","Such a wonderful feeling, to wake up and have beams of sunlight flooding into your room, while a light breeze whirls around you, as some of it makes it's way into your window. The sounds of birds chirping, children playing, and every being enjoying it's own version of life.

Then, to go outside and feel the sweet sensation of cool air filling your lungs, the heat radiating off the blacktop, and the smell of flowers. 

To be able to walk, talk, and do what you please. Be wise with your decisions, and live this day as if it were your last. You'll never, ever, in your entire life again see, hear, or feel May 29, 2004.

Do yourself a favor and dont waste it, but enjoy it like a cup of hot tea. Take it slowly, and savor it until you take that last swill, and those last drops slip down into the caverns of your inner-self, in more than one way..."

"event","Wowww, what an amazing weekend.

Friday: Left for montreal around 9 am, after realizing my dad took my passport out of my wallet in fear that i would lose it! -_-, oh well, just a minor set back. i got to talk to kenny alot, while mike and kevin slept in the back seat. Once mike was up our conversations got a little crazier, mike is so funny! 

We got to Kolo's around 5 pm to be greeted by Matt Cross. It was a surprise to see him there. He's very good at the guitar! and shredding, hehe. Then i met Ianek who is very cool, and also good at shredding. We got our stuff together and all went to a gym to shred; Myself, kolo, mike, kevin, sebastien, ianek, laroche, and matt. Most of us played like crap but it was still very fun. Afterwards we went back to kolo's showered up, and went out to get some food on St. Catherines street. Nothing too interesting happened that night, but ""you look like a damn fool, get that chain off ianek!"" was hilarious! lol matt is funny...

Saturday: Woken by a perky kolo beating me with a pillow...interesting. Kolo made us all breakfast, then off to the tournament site for l'hivernal net action! kenny was really good, him and chris got 4th place. Too bad kenny didnt get to play manu, that would've been SOOO fun to watch. I also got to watch JF Lamieux play, hes one of my favorite net players to watch. And Genevieve Bousquet...<3::drool::<3

enough about net though, how bout some freestyle? well...most of us were playing horrible. tired from the previous nights session, and like...the worst surface possible for shred, still fun though. Ellis, Caro, and James showed up this time. We were all kinda antsy to hit the town again so, once the net matches were over, we got showered and went out to eat. It was this cool italien place that had a ""bread bar"". you get pieces of bread and put flavored butter on them, and then fire-grill them yourself. Very good.

Next we went out and found this SUPER-AWESOME club called Fafoun. Not like clubs here at all. All they played was punk, ska, and metal, too cool! i had a blast here. Mosh pits, lots of quebecois hotties ;-), good music, and being able to purchase alcohol. The only downside to this was that kevin got absolutely chundered. It's not really my place to tell everyone about his business so, yea.. 

Sunday- woke up 10 minutes before kenny arrived to head home. Chugged 5 glasses of water, scarfed down a pop-tart, and was ready to go. We had a little set-back of about 5 hours relating to the chunderage...but like i said, not my business.

great quotes... ""yes sir"", ""..and thats when i stopped liking the color black"", ""Quel je mouf?"", ""i could have drank WAYYY more than that!""

All in all an amazing weekend. I HEART MONTREAL! Fafoun is awesome. the end.

oh, and on another note, i need to shred more. later everyone.."

Then tomorrow morning, off to L'hivernal! wahooo! It's gonna be awesome watching Kenny compete in net for the first time in...well, awhile. I hope he dethrones the manu. Plus i'll get to shred a little with the montreal freestylers, that'll be the highlight. and i took out a school camera so maybe i can take some cool pics while im up there, too.

alright, time to pack and prepare myself (physically AND mentally).

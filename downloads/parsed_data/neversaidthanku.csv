   Next week is the last week of classes! Praise the Lord beacause I feel like inside i'm falling apart. Literally. Its like I can hardly breathe anymore from the pressure of life. I'm trying to find a job for this summer and so far all my efforts have failed. I feel like every where I go I get treated like a little kid. I really want to have a fun summer and work somewhere nice...oh please Lord help me to find something good.
   I lost my cell phone last weekend. That has angered and frusterated me quite alot this week. I really would like to find it. Pray for me.
   Also i wanted to give a shout out to hols....i really miss you kiddo.  Please be my friend still.

Blessings to all, 
Jen"

"event","Whew.....what a weekend. I feel like i don't even know what i do anymore. Its like Im just coasting through life, not even consciously making desicions. Just living. Maybe no one else understands, but i guess its how i feel.

So let me give you a brief summary of the events of my life lately to keep you up to speed.

Friday after health lab was done (11:00ish)colin and i got a picnic lunch and went out by the river and sat and ate and enjoyed the gorgeous weather. (It would have been super cute and romantic if i had any romantic feelings for colin at all) And then I came back and did some homework and hung out with kelly. That night i went out to dinner with Amy, Kelly, and sarah downtown and then we went to my house and hung out with my parents quick. IT was super fun. And then we made a random wallmart run. We got back to campus at like 10 and were bored so we went out to the middle of the football stadium and layed down and looked at stars. It was such a pretty night

Saturday was our marathon shopping trip. Me, Kelly and Traci went to the mall of america for the day and then went out to eat at the cheesecake factory for dinner. It was absolutely amazing. And i didnt even spend that much money.

Then today we went to church and then did homework out by the river. Its been sort of a blah day. I'm super tired too. I'm too unfocused to study. 33 days till schools done. i think im going to have a nervous breakdown."

"event","a few things to mention.....
First of all, tonight is a Saturday night.  I should be out partying on the town, right? Wrong O. I am hangin in with my roomie...doing absolutely nothing. I am actually really wiped out.  So yep, i loser. Not out having a good time, but in contemplating my future.

Recently my life has been getting increasingly complicated.  Just when i think i have things figured out something happens that totally changes my perspective on things and life in general.  So last friday I went to the hospital in Winona and shadowed a Occupational therapist for the day. It was a really good experience, but it made me question my desire to pursue OT. I am just so not sure about anything. I could see my self doing about a million things in the future...that scares me. It makes me think maybe i'll never narrow things down. 

Here's another thing: my mind has been last years mission trip to New Orleans alot lately. It's like everything i do or see relates to something we did in New Orleans. So many memories; My amazing classmates, Easter in the detention center, the French Quarter, Turn Around skit, being streched by the Lord, fear factor eating challenges, the project housing, hours and hours crammed in the van, and about a million other emotions that filled me during the trip. AGH! i just wanna go back and have that time again and feel that way about God and life and relationships again.  Consequently, since i miss New Orleans so much, i want to go on a missions trip alot right now. I really feel like i need to to reconnect with the Lord and myself again. And i am so restless here at school...not knowing my major and not really having a plan for my life. I feel like im at a long red light..........

Cheers my good freinds"

"event","Hello friends.....its been awhile.

Today was a blah day. Yesterday it was absolutely gorgeous out and i went for a nice long run and it felt amazing. Then Kelly drug me out rollerblading with her, which was interesting because i havent rollerbladed in like 10 years. 
.....But today is sort of cloudy and windy and im feeling all sore from my run so im takin it easy.  I just love springtime....everything about it. The smell, thunderstorms, how everthing gets sort of busy and frantic, warm breezes, flowers coming out, goofing around outside, and knowing summer is right around the corner. Someday, when i have a special significant other, i am going to go for a walk with them some warm spring night and we'll be holding hands and it will be all romantic....somday.
      Lately, I've been feeling a bit caged in here.  I love where i am in life right now, dont get me wrong, i wouldnt want it any other way. Its just the spring fever coming out and my lack of focus for school thats making it hard to keep pluggin away with my school work. 
      ho hum....i should get back to work
Cheers"

"event","Hello Friends...
So today is monday...5 days to go until spring break! I am so antsy for spring break to get here so i can relax and eat yummy food! but this week is going by so slowly...ahhh! i can't take anymore school!

The weekend was fun. Friday after class Amy, Kelly, Scott, and I went to the conference track and field finals in Platteville,(which is like 2 hrs away) so it was a little road trip. It was good times but a really boring drive. Then Friday night me and Kelly went on a date. We went to olive garden and then the pearl for yummy cappucino oreo ice cream. And we walked down by the river where there was lots of couples making out. Then we went back to campus and watched Yours, Mine and Ours...which is a classic, everyone should rent it!

Saturday I went to a horse show with my sis and then went to the lions club fish dinner with my mom. Which my mom and i vowed never to go to again, because it was icky. After dinner, I came back to campus and went to cold stone with kel, sarah and another sarah. I really hate cold stone. I mean, I want to like it so much, but i always get sick. Its real sad. So after cold stone, i get a call from Hilary, my freind from high school, and she says that that a bunch of people are back in town for spring break and so i go hang out with them

It was very exciting to see Leah and Alicia and Hilary again! They've changed so much. Leah and Alicia have been in Texas all school year and Hilary goes to Wheaton College. God is doing amazing things in their lives, its so amazing! On a side note: we watched the movie the Forgotten, if you ever get a chance to see that movie, DON'T DO IT! It's absolutely terrible.

SO here i am, counting down the hours until I am free....and guess what I have a math final, a psych midterm and a speech all coming up this week! please pray that I make it through this week alive.

Cheers"

"event","Well another weekend has gone by in the blink of an eye. Where does the time go? I feel like all week i'm restless for the weekend and then it gets here and is gone before i know it. 

This weekend was definetly...well...painful. Let me explain. In health lab friday we did this series of squats and leg strengthening exercises and i thought: ""hey i can do this stuff, no problem."" Well let me just say, saturday i could barely move. my butt and my thighs hurt so much i couldnt even sit down. I havent been in so much pain since soccer pre season training. ouch!

So here's the other painful part. I got in a pretty serious fight with my mom.  This fight has been brewing for awhile, we both knew it was coming, and it just sort of erupted while i was home. Basically my mom and i are complete opposites and that makes it hard for us to communicate. She sees things one way and i see it the other. and we both are stubborn. I wish life wasnt so hard and that it didnt take so much strength to get through each day.

Im also really sad for my brother. He's far away in California and he's pretty messed up.  He is struggling to find a vision and career path for his life. and he's dropping out of grad school this semester. He always sounds so bitter on the phone. I wish he would move close so i could go visit him and talk to him and tell him that i care about him alot and that God loves him too. 

SO here i am on the brink of another week. I have two tests tomarrow. midterms. Just can't hardly wait.

Cheers and Blessings"

"event","Alright...Yes, It's been awhile since I have written in this thing.  I've had a crazy week, so cut me some slack, ok? I had a math, bio and psych test last week and it was intense. 

This weekend was real fun. Friday night I went shopping with Kelly and Sarah and we bought way too much stuff. Then we came back and drank tea and relaxed, which i really needed. Saturday I went to a dance/pom competition and watched Amy's (my roommate)cousin and her team.  I have to say, it was pretty fun. Those of you that know me, know that i am easily entertained and enjoy a good competition. It was cut-throat let me tell you...big time tension at that place :) Anywhoo after the dance extravaganza, me, amy, and kelly went to the mall and tried on random/obnoxious prom dresses! we picked out the most butt ugly ones and put them on and took pictures. Yeah...i know, we're weird. Then after the good times with the prom dresses we went out to dinner and Applebees and I got this chicken stir fryish thing and it was sick...but no worries it was okay.  Then we came back and watched Steel Magnolias, a random 80's movie that was real sad, but i feel asleep so i wouldn't really know.  

So here I am, on the brink of another week. Ish...I hate school so much it scares me.  And I have to give a speech this week, which is even bigger yuck.  Sometimes, do you feel like the bigget dork you know? I sure do.

WEll CHEERS"

"event","Pretty uneventful weekend. I was sick so i went home and slept for most of it.  Don't you just love having a really bad cold that makes you feel all icky and drained? I know I do. But it was chocolate obsession weekend on the foodnetwork, which is my favorite channel of all time, so that was a small bright spot in a marginally crappy weekend.

I've got a chip on my shoulder, I've got something under my skin, something is majorly bugging me. And since this is my livejournal im gonna just get it all out.  I feel trapped. So, yeah, I had a pretty rocky childhood as far as my ability to make friends and get along with my parents. But now i feel like im in a place (emotionally) where Im okay and that these things are no longer issues. However, I feel like my parents are not quite ready for me to live down these things. Its a constant issue in my life, with my mom especially. Its like I can never prove to them that I am normal, that i have freinds, that Im not who i used to be. But my mom is SO unrelenting. She can never trust me about things. She makes me feel like Im the biggest loser ever. She gives me crap about how much I come home, she lectures me about how im not having her definition of a good ""college experience.""  I get lectured on how i need to smile more, be more fake.  Sheesh....give me a freakin break please.  Im just trying to survive and keep my head above water with her.  It really hurts though.

So now im back at school and its all rainy and depressing. Im looking out my window and watching random kids get dropped off by their parents after a weekend of doing who knows what. And i wonder, do they feel like me? do they feel all the pressure of life, do they have parents who exasperate them, do they feel like sometimes life is too much? .....Probably not.

Well good times, i have a ton of homework tonight and tomarrow is valentines day and i have no valentine.

Cheers"

"event","Well let me just say it sucks to be sick in college. My head feels like it was hit by a truck right now. I feel real yucky and stuffed up. Ish! 

So today was pretty much a normal day. I went to class, did homework, the usual. Colin and I went to panera for dinner and it was really yummy. Then we went to dairy queen and got dipped cones! I love dipped cones. but we were trying to figure out what exactly the outer shell of a dipped cone is made out of. He seemed to think it was parafin wax. Somehow I doubt that.

Then after dinner we went to campus crusade, which was real fun. They had a pannel of couples and singles who talked about their relationships/singleness.  Good stuff. I just wanna say that I could never kiss dating goodbye. I know some people think its a really Godly thing to do, but it would never work for me. I think dating is great...theres no need to kiss it goodbye. Yes there are certin people who really screw up dating and or date just to date, in which case yes, their kind of dating is bad, but healthy dating where people communicate and care about eachother seems fine to me. So thats my stance on dating. That being said, yep i have no valentine this year and will be spending the big V-day at a high school basketball game! wahoo.

After crusade we went and made valentine cards and sugar cookies in the basement of my hall, which was good times. I love sugar cookies. They might be my favorite cookie. And I made a really pretty card. But like I said, i have no valentine so im not sure who im going to give it to. Oh well.

So im off to sleep because im super tired and my head is pounding and I have a 7:45 class tomarrow.

"event","Do you ever feel like life is just a series of repeated motions over and over again? Wake up, go to class, eat, work out, go to bed and then wake up and do the same thing again. Its an endless cycle. I feel restless and bored with my life right now. Like there's no time for anything but the ususal crap that fills my day. So here's the paradox....I want excitement but i'm afraid to take chances, I want really close friends, but im afraid to open up.  What is it with me?

I miss my high school freinds today. I just deceided that. Al of them are all spread out and I hardly talk to them anymore. We all used to be so close....all 14 of us Coulee kids. I miss my freedoms in high school and my innocence. I miss feeling like the world was mine and that I could handle anything that came my way. I miss thinking that I was strong, confident and capable. Those were good days.

So I have a math test in a 1/2 hour. Yep, Im in remedial math and Im having trouble passing. How dumb is that? Why do things have to be so hard for me all the time? Its so frusterating how my brain works sometimes. 

Today i am sick of school...How in the world am I going to make it 5 more years? yuck

"event","So this is it....My very first entry. I'd like to dedicate it to my Hols, who introduced me to live journal. I'm not sure why I feel the need to journal my life, seeing as it isnt really that interesting, but i hope that all who read it enjoy it.

Anyway, today was depressing. I have a bad case of the mondays. The weekend was glorious,warm and restful and now I am back at school hitting the books. Its freezing cold out and i wish it was spring time and warm and sunny. And of course that would mean that school was almost over, and we all know that would be wonderful.

Does everyone else but me really love to be in college? I feel like im the only one who really hates going to class and learning about neurological influences on psych and factoring a bionomial. I feel like there is more to life. But it turns out, maybe there really isnt. Maybe this is all that life really has to offer. In which case heaven must be stinkin awesome. 

I've deceided its my goal to figure out what i want to do with my life in the next year. Yes a year from now ill have a really clear plan. I think thats enough time. So anyone who cares, check back with me in a year. Until then...hang tight.

Well thats enough random, boring thoughts. Cheers."

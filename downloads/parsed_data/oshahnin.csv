"event","I've read an awful lot of bashing of London's wee section at the closing ceremony of the Olympics.&nbsp; So, since I've been hanging around on livejournal far too much lately, I thought I'd stick my neck out and say that I really liked it.

We Brits do a really fantastic job of taking the piss out of ourselves.

The dancing umbrellas were fantastic.&nbsp; I had a sort of psychic moment beforehand where I predicted there'd be synchronised bus driving, but I never could have predicted a transforming bus with bushes.

Okay, so the kids and football were kind of sickening, but there's always the obligatory cheese at these things.

Anyway, what I liked most was just that we weren't trying to be China.&nbsp; We weren't all pristine and perfect and elaborate.

There was an old guy rocking out on a guitar and the sweat was pouring off him.&nbsp; But he rocked.

Because this is clearly what Briton is all about:&nbsp; old men, sweat, guitars and rock and roll.

Genius.



Please note, I am in no way referring to the travesty that was the 'party' afterwards.&nbsp; The organisers of that should be shot."

I don't really tend to blog here any more.&nbsp; I usually blog on www.avarinne.net if anyone is interested :)&nbsp; (not that I'd blogged there in ages either)

Just thought I'd log on and mention that I really love my new degree (since the last post I made was so depressing).

I'm only doing more general human biology modules at the moment, but I love it.&nbsp; I really love all the molecular stuff that we barely touched on in medicine.

I'm a geeky scientist and proud of it :)

So life is really good.

"event","I've not updated in a while, so I thought I'd say a quick hi to those people still using livejournal :)

A fair bit has changed.  As of tomorrow, I'm no longer a medical student.

Possibly one of the most gutting things ever to happen to me.  After a resit year and completely studying my ass off for the exams, and after all the illness and madness that I went through, it turns out to all be for nothing.

What really makes me frustrated was how much knowledge I had about things that didn't come up at all.  I could have passed either of the exams I sat last year this time round and so many things came up that I was told we 'shoudln't focus on this year.'  We're supposed to know everything, i know, but how can anyone know everything?

Anyway, no point in getting frustrated.  I did better this year.  I only just failed, and with the pass mark being as it is, I can't have done too badly.  Still, can't help feeling like a total idiot.  I repeated a year and still failed.  Feeling like an idiot is probably quite justified.

I'm getting myself together a wee bit now, but it's still pretty rubbish.  Obviously there's other degrees out there and a whole life other than medicine, but for the last three years and even before that has been entirely geared towards something I'll never have.  I was speaking to the advisor at the medical faculty, and she was talking about how she thought it was insane how committed we're supposed to be and that it will be really weird to come out of that all of a sudden.

Scary is more like it.  I went to the careers advice centre and felt utterly clueless.  I didn't know where to start or what half of things he was talking about were.  Medicine was just medicine.  You did it and became a doctor.

I have until the end of July to pick a new degree and I have no idea what I'm going to choose.

I think the worst thing is I feel I've kind of lost contact with people over how crazy things have been these last two years, especially around exam time.  I'm probably not helping any.  Most of what I've done since I failed has been hiding away.  I cut out so many things because of medicine and it was for nothing.

Anyway, enough ranting.  I know this should feel like an opportunity.  Goodness knows I complained enough about having no choices within medicine.  But I can't help feeling more like my whole world has disappeared when I wasn't looking.

Anyway, I hope everyone else is doing good.  Sorry if you're one of the people I lost contact with."

"event","Hey, know I've not updated this in ages, but I finally have something worth updating about.

All is good in Annabel world.  I failed my exams and have to resit, which sucks muchly, but I've already been through all the tears and stupidness that accompanies such things and now I'm fine.

Anyway, today.

This morning I headed off to the airport and got myself on a plane down to Cardiff.  Apart from being late (*cough*Omar*cough*) at the start of the day, Omar felt bad and paid for me to get a taxi to the airport, so all turned out well in the end.  Silly boy and his super long showers.  Got the plane with no problems at all and, this time, my bag didn't end up in Belfast but was in fact one of the first bags out.  Whoop ^^

Met Becky at the bus station and we caught a bus out to the nice wee residential area she stays in.  We walked through the park, which was beautiful and smelled of flowers (apart from the dog taking a crap) and then she showed me her house.  It's <i>massive</i>.  I'm staying in one of her housemate's room as they're away over the weekend.  Really nice :)

So, so far, we've had pub lunch, chatted about all sorts, drunk beer and headed over to this internet cafe.  And after this we're going to head back to the park to just sit in the sun and chill.  Amazing.  I haven't had a proper chance to sit in the sun all summer - primarily because there really hasn't <i>been</i> any sun.  So all is good now.  Will probably burn to a crisp.

ALSO, we managed to get in contact with Nathan, who might now be joining the party on the sunday XD yus!  So all is good.

All in all, it's a little bit ace.  I'll give a full update when I get back.

Hope everyone is well and having a good summer :)"

Had another breakdown day, this time thanks to parents interfering and whatnot.  It's all very complicated and boring, so I won't bore you, but they humiliated me and made me feel like a total and utter failure.  On a day when I had to go to the study landscape and work all night to get an essay done.

Yus.  Thanks for that parents.

*feels horrendous*

On the upside, it's 5am and I'm finished.  4 hours before deadline!  Huzzah!

But yeah.  Things are really very shit right now, and as far as I can figure out, it's all my fault.

*wonders if her eyes would hurt more or less if she removed them*

Apologies for the ranting.  As soon as Jennie is done, I am away to bed."

"event","I always seem to update this late at night in the study landscape.  It's an excellent procrastination technique, I guess, so it makes sense.

Anyway, as usual with my oh-so-chaotic mind, life has been up and down and all over the place.


<b>The bad things: </b>

My flatmates have, essentially, been making my life pretty damn horrible of late.  Like, they've always been horrible, but (though the individual events are small and petty) the constant build up of ganging up and general bitchiness has left me unable to relax at home and generally stressed and upset.  In a word, rubbish.

As usual, stressed about uni work.  Won't bore you with the details.  Work work work, exams exams exams.  You get the idea - I'm sure you've all been there too.

Throw into that cheery mix my hyperacidity and continuing health problems and you have a recipe for one large, unending nightmare.

<b>The good things:</b>

It isn't at all an unending nightmare due to a multitude of reasons.

The first and foremost is my most fabulous friend Jennie, who has not only sat and stressed with me in the study landscape through all hours of the night, but has also persuaded her (wonderful) parents to allow me to move into her shiny new fabulous flat two months early without paying any rent.  I can move out straight away.  No more evil flatmates.  Some peace of mind.  A nice place to retreat to.  Wonderful.  AND I can move out my stuff gradually, because the room on Dowanside is still mine til July 1st.  Yus.

Omar has also continued to be wonderful.  He puts up with my stress fits and suchlike, and generally looks after me, despite his crappy job and own personal stresses.

My other friends are also fabulous.  Saw a few of them today and only had to mention in passing that I was moving out and they all offered to help.  It was great to see them all and it cheered me up immensely.

And!  Last but not least, Helen came to stay this weekend, and we've had an amazing one.  Just general chilling, insanity, eating of sushi and aceness.  Wish I had a little less work to do though.

But hey, I had fun today and I'm paying for it by being in here at four in the morning doing the family project.  It's totally fair enough.  I'm still happy, which is all good.

Zenbu ee desu :D

Also, Omar's Japanese talking cat is both amazing and terrifying.  Though it did make me giggle when it said it really liked me (I was dead pleased that I knew what it said too!  There was heaps of stuff I didn't understand though).

Anyways, I do believe that's all for now.  Really should do some more bullshitting."

You know you can't sleep when you go onto qmunity at about 4, don't post anything, but stay there til 7am.

Rubbish.

Omar is all tucked up in bed sleeping.  I would be all like 'aw, he's so cute, I never see him sleep' if I wasn't so fucking jealous.  Stupid cunting wanking bastard *throws things at him*

Grr.

And don't you hate it when you go to waste time by doing the motherfucking meme of all memes on myspace, and then 'Sorry, the profile of this user is undergoing maintenance.  No you can't post.'

Rarr.

On another note, Claire's birthday dinner was ace.  I made so much sushi that my back hurt for hours afterwards.  Nearly a kg of sushi was made.  I feel (in learning how to make sushi) that I have risen to a new plane of existence.  Go me.

Some stuff has happened since my last update.  I shall make the bad stuff uber short - french has been, essentially, hell on earth.  Had huge stress induced hysterical breakdown, decided I didn't want to do medecine, got over it, did the exam, it kinda went okay, realised that I do - in fact - want to do medecine.  Just not second year.  And not french.

...good incentive to pass both then!

So that's over, and I'm now on holiday.  YATA!

*is muchly happy*

It began with the St Patricks day 10 hour Cheesy Pop.

Holy fuck.  Wow.

2 Unlimited were fucking AMAZING.  Not only that, but Toast checked out the backing cd before she began, and it was just music.  She sang the whole damn thing.  She can really sing!  Wow!  Slight improvement on Urban Cookie Kareoke!

I think hearing No Limit sang live was really a once in a lifetime moment.  It's sad, I know, but it's true.  I love them.  I love that song.  It was so fucking amazing.

Due to general stress and lack of fun lately, I went NUTS on the balcony.  Danced like a total fanny.  Someone took a picture of me and it was just a glowstick blur.  Turned out that I was dancing quite near the general manager of the building, Mr Mac, which was kinda funny.  He had a wee giggle and asked if I had enjoyed myself when he saw me later.  Teehee ^^;;;;

Danced for hours, totally sober but totally high on adrenaline.  Then I had a few beers and enjoyed some drunken fun from about 4am onwards.  We all had a big friends mash jumping drunken dance right up until the end at 6.  It was amazing.

Stayed for about an hour afterwards, chatting to folk and generally abusing Chuck (who I apparently called Truck.  A lot.  If you've met Chuck, you'll realise how ironic that is).  The Omar took me home, I invited myself to Chuck's birthday BBQ, and Omar somehow (I don't remember how) got me home and tucked up in bed.

Stuff between me and Omar, by the way, is still just as amazing as ever.  We're coming up for ten months now O.o;  He really is the best boyfriend a girl could ask for.  He's just got a job in Phones 4 U, which is kinda lame, but it's just until he can get a real job in Computer Sciences.  You'd think 2 degrees would make it easier to find a job.  HA.  Like hell it does.

Anyway, since Cheesy, I've been chilling out.  It's been amazing.  Chilled on Saturday; went to the cinema with Omar, Mark and Jennie on sunday; saw Helen on monday, which was amazing - we went for lunch, did window shopping, some actual shopping and went for coffee - and she brought me a pendant to replace my beloved pendant that broke and went missing some time ago.  It's so shiny and ace!  After that, I went to Claire's to meet Seumas, Roz and Claire, and then Claire, Seumas, Chris, Hannah, Dallas, Omar and me went to see V for Vendetta, which was just as good the second time round.

Today I spent hours and hours tidying my room, which needed it muchly!  It looks very purty and shiny and clean now.  So yay for that.  I also went out for a couple of hours to smoke shisha at Claire's, and that proved to be much fun.  We had tasty chinese food.  Mmm.  Then I went home and tidied some more.  Omar came home and was going to come out with me, but I've left him asleep in the bed.  He was very tired from work.  Poor wee sleepy head.

I got all UVed up for Rev, which was lots of fun, but I'm feeling a wee bit fat :(  Not very good when you're all brightly coloured and can't just hide in a corner.  But meh.  The clothes still look cool.  W00p.

Rev's music turned out to be a bit shit, but that's okay, because I danced for a couple of songs and then chatted to folk.  Now I'm up in the cons office chilling until I can be bothered going back downstairs.

My neck's starting to hurt from sitting here, so I'm going to have to say bubye for now.

Hope everyone is well ^^  bubye!"

"event","I have so much work to do, but I'm just sitting in the QM doing nothing, in the vague but ultimately ridiculous hope that it will all somehow just go away.

One day it might work.

Anyway, how are things in Annabel world?

Well, the massive big huge important (well to us) Queen Margaret Union elections happened last week.  I'm impressed that I haven't even mentioned them on here (go me!) but I've kinda ruined that now.  Anyway, I was uncontested, which was cool, and I'm now a big important convenor.  Sadly though, three of my good friends (Seumas, Claire and Roz) were contested.

Claire lost the presidential election to <b>Gary Brown</b>, a cool guy who'll do an ace job, but totally awful to see Claire so upset all the same.

Seumas won the position of Honorary Secertary, which is cool.

Roz, who I was campaigning for, sadly lost the position of Honorary Assistant Secretary to <b>Gill Turnbull</b>.  Gill is a friend, is ace and will do a fucking amazing job, but that - again - doesn't stop me feeling bad for Roz.  Roz seems to be taking it really well though.

Anyway, that's been the main thing in my life the last wee while.

French is really hard work, but I'm just about coping.  Don't know if I'm going to pass though, which is a worry.

Things with my flatmates are really really shit.  I won't say any more because it's petty and stupid, and mostly involves them ganging up on me about cleaning, when I'm actually cleaner than they are on some occasions.  Bla.  Stupid flatmates.  Anyway, the long and short is that I'm moving out when my contract ends (nice as I've made my room there) and moving into Jennie's beautiful new flat (provided all goes well and her parents don't suddenly decide they hate me).  So yeah.  Silver lining.

I think that's all."

"event","Well I just got back from the skiing holiday in Avoriaz which was my birthday and Christmas present from my parents.  Wow.  Just wow.  Seven days of ski, snow and... some sun.  Actually way more than I expected.

For the first couple of days, the visibility was pretty bad.  It took me a while to find my ski legs, and there was a really amusing moment when I was coming down a red and misjudged where the soft powder began.  I toppled over and pretty much disappeared up to my neck ^^;;

The middle days were really sunny and nice ^^  We skied all over Porte du Soleil, around Avoriaz, Chatel and down into the Swiss resorts.  We also did a few lower runs which turned out to be in much better condition than we thought.

The last couple of days were a bit cloudy, and the snow started to get a bit icy.  We were both pretty run down from not getting enough sleep - despite going to bed at really reasonable times - but we still had fun.

It was altogether a really ace holiday.

Both happy and sad to be back.  It's nice to be properly home, but it's also time to face up to the real world again, and after the pretty darn awful term I had before Christmas, I'm not really sure I want to.

Came home to a couple of bombshells in my inbox that had me a bit u_u;  But it's all going to be looking up from here, because I'm determined to get my life back under control.

So yeah ^^  I'm back, everything's in one piece and I haven't lost anything... I don't think.

Oh!  And the financial situation is starting to look up a bit too.  Whoop :)"

"event","Listening to Utada and playing with the walking and singing penguin Omar gave me from his last trip to Japan.

^____^

...easily amused much?

I, incidentally, had the most fabulous of anniversaries :)  I was made to feel really special ^^  He brought me a bunch of roses and a big box of chocolates, and then took me out to a meal at a wee Korean Restaurant (I love how well he knows me).  Then we went to the cinema and saw 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,' which by-the-way is brilliant.  A really well done, good movie.

Then we were like... Doom is on...

So we bought tickets for Doom.  And then went for a walk down to Borders and then over to George Square, which was totally beautiful with all the Christmas lights.  I mean, they're over-the-top and colourful, but they're aimed at kids (as they should be) and I loved them.  There was a wee fair which we wandered through and bought hot freshly made doughnuts from.  Mmmm.  Couldn't convince Omar to go ice skating though.  I absolutely have to go ice skating in George Square this year *determined face*

Then it was back to the cinema for Doom.  I expected it to be mindless, shit but fun.

It IS mindless, but it's certainly not shit.  It's actually well done and really entertaining.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Some outstanding lines.  ^_^

After that we went for a quick drink in Rufus T Firefly's (at which Omar got very upset because there were some bar staff that he didn't recognise.  I mean *gasp* everyone in Rufus didn't immediately jump up and go OMAAAAAAAR!!! :P heehee) and then walked home for cuddles and very little sleep ;)"

"event","I noticed something quite sad on my way home from the Study Landscape (yes I'm home now, but felt this was worthy of update before I forgot).

It's just that between a mixture of my weird half-insomnia (it's not proper insomnia cause I doze and sleep a little bit), medicine, the QM and life in general, I haven't really seen daylight properly in ages.  I mean, this lack of sleeping has meant my attedence at lectures and labs has been shocking.  It's no excuse really, cause I know Jennie's not sleeping either and she turns up.

Of course, I see it briefly every tuesday, thursday and friday for PBL and VS.  I think what I really mean to say is that I haven't had a chance to appreciate it.

I mean, how often have I walked down Byres rd and enjoyed the peace, quiet and sunshine of a sunday morning? I think once (just now) would cover it.  I never get a chance to stop and appreciate things any more.

And it's only going to get worse, isn't it?  I mean, I'm a student for crying out loud.  As a doctor I'll work and sleep.  And maybe eat.  Sometimes.  Seumas made some comment involving medicine sacraficing and life all the same sentence.  I was scared shitless.

And I guess it's not just me.  Everyone is so massively busy, when does anyone get a chance to stop and enjoy things like a sunday morning any more?

On the brightside, this morning is a lovely morning.  Sets the scene for what I think will be a lovely day.  I can't think of many things nicer than spending the day with Omar doing things we both enjoy.  Yay ^^

And neither of my flatmates are in, so I got to be noisy when I got back, so yayness to the small things.

And despite it being a ridiculous time to still be awake, I'm feeling properly happy for the first time in a while.

...and I'm really going to go to bed now...

I think I'll get through this next week and sort my life out over the Christmas break.  

Apologies if I've not been replying to texts, by the way.  My phone has gone spastic.

And I'll try and reply to my back-log of e-mails after the coursework is all finished and handed in ^^; Sorry folks."

"event","Jennie and Omar laughed when I said I'd still be in the study landscape at 8.

HA!  Here I am.

Since midnight last night.

I still think they're the ones laughing, to be honest.

Madness, I tell you, madness.

I don't really know why I'm updating my livejournal rather than going home.  Stupid thing is I'm not really that tired.

.............might have something to do with the litre of coke I drank.  Which isn't actually that much... really...

I've been thoroughly creeped out by the study landscape all night.  The lights went off for no reason at all and wouldn't come on again, despite my crazy dancing (they're motion activated).  Although I was in a study room and therefore could continue to work, all the weird noises and being alone in a place where the lights just randomly went out had me thoroughly creeped out and imagining all sorts of horrible things.

I think I have the mental age of six year old.

YAY FOR TOMORROW'S DOCTORS!!!!

Anyway... why am I here?

Oh yeah.  Coursework.  LAME.  That said, it's nearly finished.  Got two questions left to do, and need to compare notes with someone to check I've done the right thing.  Other than that BOOMDIGAR! she exclaimed with great relish.

Mmmm... relish.

Yes yes yes.  Finishing it on monday cause today is mine and Omar's six month anniversary ^^  YAY!

Six months... dear god where did they go?  I've never managed to avoid getting dumped for this long, so I'm quite chuffed.  Happy happy happy.  We're going out on a date ^^  Omar went to stay at his so it would be a proper date.  Teehee.  It's going to be ace.

This post has been far too happy, so rantrant-stressed-rantrant-notseeingfriends-rantrant-nothavingfriends-rantrant...poo?

Speaking of poo, what is WITH the story mode on Super Monkey Ball 2?!  Ei Ei Poo??  Eh?  Fucking crazy.  The first one was better.

Except for monkey bowling.  That's ace.

Oo oo, been playing PSO offline again.  Tiri is 82.  Annoying cause she can beat Ult Mines, except for the second stage of the boss... but only because of his attacks kills her instantly and she's too slow to outrun it.  Been playing Ult forest a lot and just started playing Very Hard Ep. 2.  I swore I would play Ep. 2 until I'd played all of Ep. 1, so it's my first time.  It's a bit easy on Very hard, but I'd get mauled on Ultimate.  Question... is Seabed facility the last one?  Cause that's where I've got to.  Laaaaame if it is.

Lol.  I really am very busy and stressed.  This is just what I do at five in the morning when I can't sleep.

Sleep?  Wazzat?

Anyway, I believe that's all.  There's a funny smell of burning, so I'm going to leave before something catches fire.  Plus something weird is going down with the air con.  This building is weird.

*is scared*

...night night folks ^^"

"event","Hey guys, sorry for a general lack of internet presence lately.  Basically it's been a little bit of a shite week.

I had the QM elections on thursday, which I had to prepare for, and in which I got re-elected to board.  It was one hell of a stressful day, especially when they fudged up the count, but I'm so so so relieved that I'm back on til March.

Unfortunately, duty the next day was not so hot - Seumas kept getting Migraines (sp?) and I threw up for the first time ever in the QM (and it wasn't because of drink!  Something about that is fundamentally wrong) and felt the whole night feeling sick and headachey.  The two of us looked like death and it was a pretty rubbish duty.

The next day I was feeling much better, and I had to cover the first half of someone else's duty.  It was pretty ace and I was mega productive - got painting done for a campaigns event, wrote an article for qmunicate and even managed to watch Neon Genesis Evangelion in between.  However, by the end of the night, my headache was back and I was feeling a bit rubbish again.

Today was horrible.  I've had an upset stomach all day - I've been running to and from the toilet every 20 minutes and have thrown up more times than I can count. Bleh.  I got a little bit scared when I couldn't keep water down at all and when my stomach and headache got a lot worse, so Omar called NHS 24 for me.  I ended up going to see an on call doctor, which was really quick and they were really helpful for a change.  I got an injection to help stop the vomiting so that I can get some fluids in me.  And it worked :)  I've finally managed to keep some water down and drank this revolting thing that should restore all of the salts I've lost.  Still feel pretty rubbish, but it's infinitely better than before.  I managed to sit up and watch some Evangelion, and now I'm even managing to type without feeling sick.

To RP folk - sorry.  My brain is working right now and I'll have to leave RPing til I'm better.  I really hadn't noticed how long it's been since I last RPed.  Sorry :("

"event","Well, it's the first night I've done any work in here thus far, though there have been plenty of larte nights at home in my room.  One thing I like about the top floor in the study landscape of the medical school is that you can hear the rain hammering really loadly on the roof.  I like rain.  I like the sound of rain hammering against windows/the roof/etc even more.

Of course, it has to be raining for this to be a good thing about the medical school.  And presently it is <i>pouring</i>.

I've finished my coursework (the reason for this late nighter) which is due in on friday.  A day early is really quite impressive for me!  And for once I don't have a nine o clock tomorrow, though poor Jennie (who came in a brainstormed this with me and is currently still writing her own) does.  The bastards.  We did pretty damn good with our brainstorm, methinks, and in our attempts to make it look as little like we did this together as possible.

Considering it's four in the morning, I'm really quite chirpy.  The caffeine-induced-hyper-attack has (though I hate to say it, thankfully) worn off. I'm all ready to pack up, head home and fall asleep.  Still have PBL to do tomorrow, but that fine and dandy, as it isn't too big.

Yayness all round really.

Still miss my Omar though :(
He's been making a little bit more to text me and stuff, which is really nice and has calmed my ranty depressed ranting.  He even *gasp* called me, which is just unheard of in our relationship, so I really can't complain.

Booked my megabus to go home on friday.  All I need to do is finish PBL, sort out my manifesto, hand it all in and I'm good for a relaxing weekend at home.  Whoop!  I look forward to it muchly.

Anyway, Jennie is now finished (yay and a whoop and another whoop for Jennie Lennie Lunar Lady), so I'm going to e-mail myself and go home.

That said... it remains really pretty amazing.  If Naruto just made an effort to be a half decent Ninja and not just someone who leaps at folk and pummels them, then I'd be happy.

It's filling the void left by finishing Full Metal Alchemist anyway.

Oh, I also saw 'The Cat Returns,' which was really good.  I'd, of course, expect nothing less.  I didn't like it quite as much as 'Spirited Away,' or anywhere near as much as 'Howl's Moving Castle,' but it was still amazing.

Oh, and <lj user=""technobunny"">, I finally got hold of 'Neon Genesis Evangelion,' the entire series, which I'm looking forward to watching.

"event","Well, the last few days have been pretty damn rubbish.  I'd be having a good day and then I'd screw up in one way or another, and proceed to worry about it the rest of the day.  Due to lack of sleep and dwelling on things too long, I ended up getting all hysterical and upset.  Actually burst into tears at Beer and Biscuits.  Thank God for Claire - she grabbed me and shoved me into the exec office, where we drank beer and ranted about various things.  When I actually verbalised all the things that had gotten me down, I realised it was actually nothing at all and that I was just being a twat.

Again with the thank God for Claire.  She totally understood all the nothingness that makes us feel rubbish kind of thing.

So yeah, that was kinda rubbish.
I really hate this sappy new me - I never used to cry in public EVER.  And I always feel like such a twat when I do.  Which again is kind of stupid because I don't have a problem with anyone else doing it.

The weekend is shaping up to be a bit better though - I went shopping with Claire this afternoon.  Have decided to go as a creepy goth china doll to Halloween Rev, and decided not to go to Bedlam tonight.  I was a bit fed up and sad when I made this decision, but now I'm glad I did.

Lynn's family were round, and I've decided I like her sister a lot.  Her dad's really funny when he's relaxed and has had a couple of drinks, and we all sat down and had curry take-out.

So I feel things are all better again between me and Lynn.  I'd been feeling a bit bleh about my flatmates of late, but I guess that happens to everyone.  It was only due to tiredness and everything else that it had been getting to me, I think.

My room is spotless again, as I had a mad tidy up.  At least the place will stay nice while Omar is away.  Also decided to tackle my overly hairy legs, which was a bit like fighting a wild monster.  That's the trouble with having a boyfriend who really doesn't care.

Ah... Omar - as of yesterday - is away for a couple of weeks.  Or 10 days, or something.  It's really nothing at all.  But I hate to say... I miss him horribly already.  He's away for Halloween, November the 5th and our 5 month, which sucks muchly.

5 months @_@  Jesus.  I've never been out with someone that long in my life.  Lol.

Anyway, I think that about sums it up in Annabel-world just now.
I'll try and be better about updating.  Hope everyone else is well :)"

He met me at the station.  I say 'met', I really mean jumped on me from behind and nearly gave me a heart attack.  *ahem*  Gotta say, I was pretty pleased to see him :)  We headed off for food at Rufus and I ate the healthiest thing I've eaten all weekend (baked potato, chilli and cheese, which I think says a lot for the other crap I was eating this weekend).  Then we headed home, via Au Naturale (mistake - I spent money, though granted now have a proper light for my room), and the QM (pouncehugged a rather put-out looking Roz).

"event","What an <b>amazing</b> trip!!!

It started off with a series of small disasters - everyone was totally determined to rip us off.  We had to pay way more for the trains that we should have done, and the International Youth Hostel in Cardiff had a 'special rate' especially for the football weekend.  However, despite the fact that they charged us this special rate for the three nights, the girl who turned up the day after us got charged the normal rate.  Hmmmm.  Don't think the woman at reception liked us very much.  Ah well.  The people staying in the hostel were really lovely.

Anyway, on the first day we just wandered absently around, getting lost and looking for some of the things that I'd forgotten.  I was dead excited and really enjoying myself ^^  After an 8 hour train journey, me and Seumas were doing really well - we hadn't killed each other, we hadn't argued and we were both in a good mood.  After that we headed off to find the youth hostel, dump our stuff and then get back out for some food  at pizza hut.

The mission for nightlife in Cardiff is an interesting one.  After getting lost looking for somewhere Becky recommended (I think I must be the most useless person at following directions) we eventually decided to just head to the Barfly.  Just by chance, we hit a bands night with three different wee bands playing.  The first one was the most horrendous emo band I have ever heard in my entire life.  So. fucking. awful.  However, the wee band that followed them with a girl singing was actually quite good.  Me and Seumas spent a good long time trying to think up a decent outfit for her, but with little success.  Well, if she'd been in a goth band, we could have had her sorted out instantly.  But yeah, all in all, it was good fun.  And me and Seumas didn't entirely run out of conversation!  Only downer was that we were <i>again</i> ripped off, this time by a taxi driver who blatantly knew where he was going and didn't knock any money off the price.

The next day we went out to Penarth to meet Seumas' Uncle and Aunt and really started to worry about the ticket disaster (being that our gig tickets had been sent to the wrong address and, though we'd been told that we'd be on the guest list, there seemed to be no one else that knew about this).  We went for pub lunch, and Seumas' relatives were really lovely.  They let us use their internet to sort out the tickets as best we could.

So at about 7.30 we were finally all UV-ed up and ready to head off, not knowing when the gig started, where The Point actually was and what type of venue it would be.  Taxi!  Heehee.

We had been worried it all wouldn't be worth the hassle.

We were wrong.

It wasn't just a gig, it really was a proper goth night.  Not just goth, but <i>cyber</i>goth.  I've never seen so many cybers before in my life.  None of them were dressed quite like us, as we're a weird mix between raver and cybergoth (cyprog, apparently.  Lol).  And, you know, we take ourselves a little less seriously than these goths.

Anyway, the atmosphere was amazing.  Four bands (I think) played, and the first one was really good, with dj sets of ace music in between.  It was from 7 til 2am and Seumas and I danced for most of it.

But best of all, having had a wee chat with the girl taking tickets, we discovered that Ayria were just wandering about inside!  I, of course, spent the rest of the night looking for her, with Seumas rolling his eyes at me.  However, when we were having a wee sit down, I turned around and jabbed Seumas in the side and was like:
""Is that her???  Is that Jennifer Parker?""
*cautiously turns round*
""Yes, that's her.""
""I'm going to go say hi.""
""Are you being serious?""
""Well I want to.""
""...""
""I'm going, I really am.""
""Well, I'll follow you, hen.""

Heehee.  We had a wee chat with her and told her where we were from.  She gave us a shout out in the middle of her set thanking the people from Scotland.  She was just really really lovely, and the set was fucking amazing.  Me and Seumas danced at the front for the whole thing without stopping once.  She danced over to us, she pointed the mic at me during Horrible Dream (and, bad idea though it was, I did sing the words) and she chatted to us and thanked us for dancing afterwards.  Seumas also had the bright idea of suggesting that she sign our copies of her new album.  ^_^  That'll be treasured for a long time to come.

We were SUCH groupies and lovin' it.

After that, a good tune came on and we hit the dancefloor <i>again</i>.  I bet half the folk in there were wondering what the hell we were on :P  Heeheehee.

So generally, it was fucking ace.

On sunday, we attempted to do some sightseeing.  However, having had beautiful weather on every other day, it totally <i>poured</i> down on sunday.  My jeans were soaked up to the knee.  Bleh.  We went to see the castle grounds, which was quite nice, and took some silly pictures.  One thing we found was that Cardiff was definitely a very pretty city.  However, everything in Cardiff seems to shut at 4 on a sunday afternoon.  So we wandered around a lot in the rain and got turned away from a closing museum.  In the end, we went for coffee and then to the cinema to see 'The Cave' (which Seumas wanted to compare to 'The Descent' that I haven't seen). It was totally totally shite.  A whole heap of bollocks.

Then we were for food in Ask Pizza, which I remember from my Winchester days.  Lol.  It was nae too bad, but not very cheap.  And then we went on a mission for a bar that wasn't empty, a gay bar or full of chavs.  We walked for ages, and eventually walked past this pub which looked very much like the games room at the union - we even saw people who looked kind of familar - and it was (totally randomly) filled with moshers.  Well, they weren't likely to beat us up, so we decided we'd head in for a quiet pint.  Popped some tunes on the duke box and had a nice, relaxing evening.  So relaxing, in fact, that Seumas nearly fell asleep and we had to head back to the youth hostel.

The next day, apart from Seumas sleeping in a bit (ha ha ha), went off without a hitch.  We got both trains, didn't kill each other and survived despite running out of conversation and resorting to 'zuumzuumzuuum sting!'

All in all, a fucking amazing time!  And Seumas and I are still friends!  W00t!   .......   wait...... ;) heehee."

The day of birthdays began after Omar and I left the cinema after seeing Unleashed - petty good actually - and saw a man with a '70 today' badge on walking down Sauchiehall Street.  After that we headed out to go to a birthday party of a friend of Omar's, which was pretty good, considering I knew absolutely no one there.  Got a little bit drunk and a little bit stoned.  All in all pretty ace.

Then we headed back and came to where Dj Troutfish's 21st is going on at the QM - where I am now, incidentally.  The music is totally my kind of music.  A really good mix of trance and happy hardcore and suchlike.  Unfortunately I'm pretty full and don't feel much up to dancing.  A little sorry I missed the night, but there'll be other times I'm sure.

I'm not liking the way I get so easily upset and worried when friends of mine are upset.  Don't really know why, because this particular friend just snapped at me when I tried to see if stuff was okay.  Meh.  So not worth being concerned over.

Anyhoo, there's really not much more I can say.  I still have no internet or computer and I'll be sleeping on the sofa (hopefully) for the last night tonight.

Wow.  It has actually been ages and ages and ages since I updated my livejournal.  Sorry I just disappeared off the planet but, well, I have a broken computer off being fixed, a laptop that doesn't really work and no net connection in my flat.  So-o-o, this makes getting online somewhat difficult.  If anyone wants to make some writersrealm challenges, feel free.

So, what can I tell you?

The majority of my time recently has been spent trying to paint my room - I'm painting it two shades of blue, light blue below the picture rail and dark blue above.  I've been confronted with all sorts of disasters: ladders not being high enough, crap rollers, dust sheets which the paint just soaked through, spilt white spirit and not being able to reach the top.

However, we met and defeated these disasters, Omar has been absolutely wonderful, as have Seumas and Roz.  I REALLY couldn't have done it without them.

Today... we were met with the worst disaster of all.........

We've done really really well.  We nearly totally finished, bar one wall and the lower part of it at that.

But we ran out of light blue paint.

That was okay though.  Becca went to B&Q for me in a car her boyfriend had rented.



...but check this...

IT'S BEEN FUCKING DISCONTINUED.

Me and Omar took a 20 minute bus ride to the larger B&Q where they had said they'd mix us up the colour, just to be told they won't do that with a B&Q's own brand of paint.  So instead, we've bought one in the new range that /should/ be the same colour and finish, but who knows?  It's just a nightmare situation.

Anyway, enough ranting.

On tuesday, I went to Edinburgh (despite my horrendous lack of thought and organisation) to meet Helen, spend the day with her and go and see Swan Lake.  It was a-ma-zing.  We had a great time wandering about in Edinburgh and pretending we were rich.  The version of Swan Lake we saw was a mixture of a modern setting in a ballet and the original.  The choreography was absolutely incredible and the timing of the dancers was pretty much perfect.  I was totally blown away.  The ending wasn't the traditional (and best IMO) ending, but it was done so brilliantly that I thought it was incredible anyway.  So so good.  And, of course, the music just sent shivers down my spine.  Helen and I both cried, though actually at different points.  So so so so so good.  After that we wandered around a bit and went for pizza, which was just acey (and the conversation sick) and just like old times.

Things with Omar have been going really really well.  We've been seeing a hell of a lot of each other, though have yet to (I think) annoy each other.  He's been looking after me more than I could possibly ask for and is just generally lovely.

Sadly, tonight is the first proper night I've been back at cheesy pop, and I'm fucking on duty, aren't I?

Alas.

However, so far all I've had to do is rub Laura's head for 20 minutes and try to get Omar to work.  Which is a mission and a half, I can tell you.

Been eating far too much pizza recently.  Am a fat pie.  Need to stop.

Can't even dance!  *rage*

But, you know, it's not so bad.  There are people here that I like.  My good friend fancies another good friend, and I'm overly happy but unable to disclose this information at this time.

*bounces happily*

So yeah, I'm good.  For having been so fucking depressed this morning, Omar and I went on our paint adventure and he cheered me up, so yay ^^

Hope you're all well.  I'll hopefully be back online soon.

"event","Hey folks, know I haven't updated livejournal in a while.  Well, a while by my standards... probably not be other people's.  Heehee.

But, alas, I am feeling moderately pish so I have decided to return to lurk on your friends page.

My head hurts x_x;  And I feel a bit sick.  Nothing at all major.  I think the headache is - for some reason I don't understand because this has never happened before - due to using the computer without my glasses.  Maybe someone moved the monitor further away.

We continue to battle against the evil force that is my gran here in Cornwall.  Her husband has died, she deserves sympathy, but she has destroyed every shred of what sympathy I had for her.  She is evil, selfish and horrible.  I cannot say this enough times.  But battling a dragon can be fun and extremely satisfying.  We were a united front the other day and there were hi fives all round.  

She doesn't half make you pay for it though @_@

But yes, the Campbell front holds strong against the Dinsmore Dragon, though there have been divisions in the ranks at times, especially concerning my sister.  And I think my dad my might suffer from post traumatic stress syndrome for some time after this.

Tell you something, at least they get to retreat at about ten every evening.  Ha.  Staying here is like sleeping with... well... the dragon.

But the less said about all this, the better.

My last rant is that I'm getting more and more frustrated with how much I'm getting obsessed over my weight at the moment.  It is up, I do need to do something about it, but this self obsession is just doing my head in.  It was so nice when I was that little less bothered about it because I was at a weight I didn't mind that much.  Anyway, it'll be much easier to do something about it when I'm in a place where I can get out easily and control my own diet.  Dragons generally aren't good for the waistline.

Lol.  Imagine eating a dragon.  Kinda spicy and pretty tough.  Gamey, I imagine.

Right, rants over with... what's good?




...not an awful lot...

My grandpapa's funeral was lovely.  We couldn't have asked for more.  I got to say goodbye, see loads of people I hadn't seen in ages, watch so many people pay their respects to my dear old granddad and I read part of a psalm about sailors and the sea - fitting because my granddad was both a sea captain and met his end there.

He'd have loved it.  And he'd have loved the 'refreshments' afterwards too.  I reckon he'd be pleased I enjoyed it all.

Feeling a bit less sick.
This is good ^^

Em... been reading lots.  Sat up on the rocks around Pendennis Point.  Had a bit of a misadventure when I couldn't climb back up a wall that I'd jumped down.  Had lots of scratches and stinging nettle stings from where I fought my way through.  Still, better than the first route I considered because, looking down it... well... it really wouldn't have been a good plan.  And the scratches and stings all healed uber uber quickly, proving that all fun injuries heal quicker and that adventures are a good thing.

This would have been a nice holiday if it wasn't for the fact that we're attacked by an evil dragon at every turn.

We were made to go to church again today.  I don't mind it as much as I think I do - the service doesn't drag on and it's only one hour out of my life.  However, I just feel dishonest for going.  Most of the time I sit there, shocked by some of the things the idiot comes out with, amazed that everyone just chants whatever they're told to chant, confused by why hymns are so damn impossible to sing and wondering what layer of hell I'm going to.  Or indeed, arguing with myself about 'final death' which is just depressing and not something I like confronting myself about.

My mum was upset because it was too soon for her to be in the church again after granddad's funeral, but she was still made to go.  However, she ended up okay.  My gran, however, got upset.  I felt really bad for her... right until she started to act as if we'd made her do it.

....Bla... she just came in and was nice.  I think that's what really gets me about her - I can't tell whether she likes us or not.  I know she doesn't like my mum - no one could say the things she does and still like someone.  She maybe loves her, somewhere deep down, but I doubt that sometimes.  As for us, no idea.  And the potential for kindness drives me mad, because I so want to like her.  This doesn't make me feel bad for the things I've said though, because they're all true.  And you pay triple for every act of kindness.  It just makes me sad, I guess.  I think she's going to end up very lonely.  I certainly don't intend to come here again."

There were a few posts missing from the actual council, so to avoid going through all that again, I've written a small 'story so far' post.  The rest seems to be fine.

The later stuff is at least partly gone, but we can go where we like with that :)

I bought it a long time ago because of its insanity meter, and now that I've actually started to play it, it has not failed to disappoint.

Just... wow...

But now I've reached the last major fight of this chapter... with less than half my health.  I have  NO way to restore health.  I keep coming THIS close to beating the bloody monster at the end of the fight, but by that point I usually have so little health it's entirely pointless.

Raaaarrr.  It's SO infuriating.  I WILL kill that bastard.  >:\

It's like Blitzball all over again, and my long-time readers will know exactly how many times I played that first game against the Goers until I beat them THREE NIL!  HA!

This monsters will pay.  Oh yes.  DIE!

"event","Sadly my grandad didn't turn up safe and sound.

He was found in the water yesterday at about lunchtime.

No one's really sure what happened, of course, but we think he probably decided that he didn't want to live on with his Parkinson's and become a burden to everyone and lose all quality of life.

I'm okay right now, though I expect it'll hit me later or when I go down to Cornwall.  I sort of hope so, because I'm really beginning to feel like a heartless bitch.  But I'm just getting on and keeping busy.  I'm most upset for my mum and gran.
I loved my grandad to pieces and I'll miss him a lot, but he made a very brave decision and I respect him for it.  Parkinson's is a horrible disease to have, and I didn't want to see him end up in a nursing home or like the people I had to care for. This way, at least he stayed himself to the very end :)

My mum and dad have headed off to Cornwall, and my sister and I head down next sunday.  Which sadly means I don't have that much time to see everyone - I look forward to seeing whoever comes to Jennie's on monday :)

Along those lines, I'd like to thank those of you who've been there for me to chat to.  It's helped a lot, mainly because I've been worried that my not being really upset is bothering my mum.

So *hugs* to you all ^^

He was a great guy with a fantastic sense of humour, and I'm glad he didn't have to suffer with the last stages of Parkinson's."

On a more personal note, my grandad who has Parkinson's wasn't at home when my gran woke up this morning.  The police and stuff are out looking for him, but they haven't found any sign of him yet.  Apparently they've sent out a helicopter to look in the water.  I'm confident he'll return though.  We'll see.  My dad's in Scatsta right now, intends to finish his work and then - if he hasn't been found - fly back down so we can go to Cornwall in the next couple of days.

Anyway, on to happier things.
Went to Helen's on wednesday evening with Jennie.  We stayed overnight and sat out in the garden in the sunshine.  It was really really lovely :)  Did some writing exercises too, which I've not done in a long time.

Today is one of those weird days where it looks quite sunny and yet the sky still looks quite grey.  A really thin, washed out colour of sky.

Listening to Mr Bojangles just now.  Forgotten how ace this tune was.

Come back and dance ^^

Heehee.  This playlist is pretty ace - straight into Tainted Love."

"event","I shattered my clavicle back in April.
I didn't have insurance so the hospital didn't want to help me.
U.A.B.(yeah the super bad-ass surgical team) 
Has done two surgeries on my average fracture and still haven't fixed it.
Because if they don't have your money right away they would rather sue you and get it.
After the second surgery I wasn't able to work.
While I was recovering my roommates in Hoover move to FLA.
Taking my H.D. T.V. and the rest of my expensive belongings.
I get in touch with one of them and he says hes bringing the stuff back on the weekend.
Now no one answers my calls.
The Re-po man just took my car.
And my arm hurts so bad I don't sleep but 1 hour a night.
Everything I've worked for since I was 15 is gone now.
Erased. All I did when I was 15-last April was work for those things.
In four years I gained SO much.
In one I lost it all and even more.
My only friends abandoned me.
Whether it be because of drugs, alcoholism, or just more important things.     
My father abandoned me.
Just to go chase some pussy in another state so he can have his 'replacement' family.
And my big brother abandoned me.
The biggest role model 
throughout my childhood
throughout my life
Hangs himself in his back yard.

How the fuck am I supposed to feel about all this?
How am I supposed to feel?
If anyone reads this and knows how to help me 
for fucks sake let me know.

I have had that gun to my head.
I have had my finger on the trigger for so many years
but I can't fucking squeeze.
Something tells me not to give up to have hope.
But I have NEVER seen any proof.
I have NEVER seen any God.
I have never seen any happy endings.
All I can see is a world that spins off of apathy.
Monsters swallowing up the light of the world
and all innocent are being mangled in the crossfire.

Maybe if my music is loud enough I can ignore everything.
I guess that's all I really can do."

but I'm doing good
being more productive
getting shit taken care of
not sleeping well tho
depression keeps the sleep away.
I'm never fully awake
But I'm never fully asleep.
I'm hopeful
I'm alive
Don't have much to do tho...
Don't really have many friends
Kinda need to find a female somewhere
But then again not really
I'm working out a lot
nothing better to do
gained 15 pounds in one week 
By time I go out in public again I'll be a beast.
Its almost 9am and I've been laying in bed 
staring at the ceiling all night,
went and saw 'The Orphanage' with Elizabeth and some of her friends.
twas bad ass...
I need someone to hold on to
I feel too alone
now that I have my bullshit together I realize 
I have nothing to show for it
good god I need to get laid
maybe instead of working out so much :p

A lot has been going through my head
thinking about all the crazy shit, the fun shit,
Amari and I
watching that Mexican guy crush his head and die
I remember school and drugs
my youth seems like its only a dream
a dream that was wasted

Mehh 
I'll stop this pointless post
Ill read it in a year 
and hate myself for not being 
any better of a person.

Dreams are given to you 
when your young enough to dream em
before they do you any harm
They don't start to hurt
unless you try to hold on to em

"event","HAPPY NEW YEARS
Look back at all the failure
Look back at every time 
you took 2 steps then 4 back
Look at how much you have lost and how little gained
Now look at the years before
Can't remember the good ones can you?
Neither can I

07 Gaining nothing, losing all gained in. 04,05,06
06 Going nowhere Gaining little
05 Giving everything just to go nowhere
04 Realizing its gonna look bad soon

Now for 08
which road?
Move away from it all
all the nothing and all the memories
Of horror and joy
work my way up so I can go to school

Or stay
Find more work
work my way up
go to school
and deal with the nothing and shit
until I can handle anything
Or crumble because I can't handle anymore.

I often think of how much more I can take
I often think of how easy it would be to give up
But in order for me to see what I can take I can't give up

So my only reason to live is to see how bad life can be
Fuck everything 
Fuck everyone 
Fuck me 
Fuck the world 
Fuck politics 
Fuck religion
Fuck life
Fuck love

well ok I don't believe in ""love"" 
But I do believe in love/respect/warmth/security
Only proofs of love

I don't have that
but the want for it 
makes me want to stay alive
just the idea of stability
even false stability is still nice....




On that note why do I always get on LJ 
when I'm suuuuuuper fucked up.

Ive been in in the past couple of years 
because I wanted to take it slow instead of 
rushing in and fucking it up
Ive been fucking dwelling on my brother and staying depressed
so long that it fucked up the only comfort I have.
Now that I notice it, I'm sure its too late
I'm sooo fucking tired of being the friend
I'm really god damn sick of almost every girl I know telling me 
how perfect I am and how they wish they could have a guy like me
yeah a guy LIKE me
but NEVER me 
This has by far been the worst year of my life
Its taken me months to get the image of Kevin hanging from a tree
out of my head and now I can tell that I'm better 
but the only thing it was effecting has passed
Every time I look at my revolver I think maybe I should just finish it
But come Jan. If things don't look up I'm moving back to Atlanta
And if that falls through again Its over for me
I am not going to waste another year of my life thinking maybe next year things will look up, 
because its only gotten worse.

I hope someone will pop up and change my mind around
but I doubt anyone gives a fuck"

I don't want to come back
There is a point when you quit looking to the top from the bottom
and learn to be comfortable with the bottom
when the only way to be happy
is to be sad because its what your so accustom to
you learn to enjoy what you have
but when all you have is emptiness
to try and fill it is almost painful
all the past times of trying your best all the way too the end
just to be knocked back down
leaves me with this fear of failing 

Ive been knocked off my own two feet
and Ive pulled myself back up
Just to have my legs broken
Ive scrambled back on them 
Just to land in broken glass
So why keep fighting gravity?
How long should I refuse to go down
Before it kills me.

"event","A woman has a close male friend. 
This means that he is probably interested in her, 
which is why he hangs around so much. 
She sees him strictly as a friend. 
This always starts out with, 
you're a great guy, 
but I don't like you in that way. 
This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview 
and the company saying, 
You have a great resume, 
you have all the qualifications we are looking for, 
but we're not going to hire you. 
We will, however, 
use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. 
But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified 
and is probably an alcoholic. 
And if he doesn't work out, 
we'll hire somebody else, 
but still not you. 
In fact, we will never hire you. 
But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.

"event","Ummmm we were supposed to move last wed... then Friday....now Monday.
And knowing how crazy my mom is I dont think we are moving I think shes just trying to convince herself she is because any day now my step dad can sell our house from under us and well be homeless...

So Im looking for an apartment if anyone wants to go in with me...

I really am uncertain about all these changing dates
And the fact Ive only seen 'our' new house once when it wasn't finished being built...

But hell, 
right now Im just throwing that out there because 
she fucks around at critical times and now Im a little worried.

Oh well at least were not in Atlanta this time if its true."

"event","Its a picture perfect evening and Im staring down the sun
Fully loaded deaf and dumb and done
Waiting for sedation to disconnect my head
Or any situation where Im better off then dead...

EDIT :

Spent last night roaming around the city by myself to clear my head.
It was good for me I guess.
I realized im leaving the valley this week...

and WOW the valley is why I have balls, 
its why i can walk through a crackhouse and not think twice, 
why I dont fear physical pain anymore....
alot of memories about to be left behind in this house
Alot of blood, sweat and tears....the only good thing is the lessons ive learned.

Im really lonely but I dont want to be around friends

I need something else

I havent been sleeping much lately...
that may be a big part of why i feel this way...
I dont know... Fuck it, im gonna go for a walk."

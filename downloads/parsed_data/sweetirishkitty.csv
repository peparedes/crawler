"event","Travel back with me two weeks.  Brian and I had Robert (Igon to my TC family) arrested for assult and since we live in a crime-free community he had to be evicted.  Brian and I were also threatened with eviction because we broke the lease aggreement.  Well, we weren't evicted, just had to throw another $600 onto our deposit, along with cover Robert's portion of the rent.  I know all of you that are reading this are saying, ""I told you so"", but he was a good rommate, until he started doing coke and roids; totally flipping out.  

School started a few days later.  I'm so happy to be back.  I'm enjoying my classes and starting to get into the heart of my major.  No more bullshit classes to deal with.  So far my Natural History of Az's going to be the most difficult, because it requires me showing up every week.  I believe that I have the most monotone professor at ASU, who doesn't believe in online posting or a textbook.

Last weekend I traveled up to San Francisco to see some family members that I hadn't seen in years.  T picked me up from the airport and we drove over to Pier 39 where I suprised Jeremy and Pebbles and met Cammie (kudos to you bro, she seems like a keeper).  From there we went to lunch, did some shopping, and eventually were reunited with the whole crew.  Even my friend Robyn drove up from Santa Cruz to join the reunion.  It was great seeing everyone again.  We went to a really cute Irish pub, that had the worst music (""I've got it.  It's Prodigy."") and then onto the Korean Karaoke Bar.  I can tell you now that Colin, James, and Dave still don't know the words to Eye of the Tiger, even though they tried singing it 3 times.  My liver wasn't quite prepared to be back around all the TC folk.  Sunday we started at 11am and didn't stop drinking until my airport shuttle came Monday morning at 4am.  It was really interesting being picked up from the airport still drunk (Sorry Mark).

Coffee Grounds reopened on Wed.  It is now called The Boat House and is run by 3 old patrons.  I met up with Erik, Brian, and Cap for the grand opening.  It was great seeing them again.  We managed to run up a $120 tab within 4 hours.  Poor Mark had to pick me up in my drunken stuppor, again.  But a lot of things came out of those 4 hours.  We're talking about hitting the rock gym next week and doing a rim-to-rim of the Grand Canyon in November.  Erik and I are also talking about going camping in a few weeks.  A reinactment of the Florance trip we had in March... I'll bring the Jameson :-P.  

I think that that was the quick update.  For all of those out there who ask me everytime we speak.. no, I'm still single, but very happy with where I'm at.  I'm going to try to get into bed tonight before 4am, have to meet the fam for breakfast at 9.  

I dont know if you can see, the changes that have come over me.
In these last few days, I've been afraid that I might drift away
And I've been tellin old stories, singing songs
That made me think about where I came from
That's the reason why I seem so far away today.

"event","I love my apartment, but I am overly frustrated with Brian.  He's just doing things to get on my nerves at this point.  He doesn't have a job so he'll call me 4 or 5 times a day asking me the most random questions, for example, ""Who do you think would win in a battle, Spiderman or Batman?""  He also calls up and pouts when I tell him I don't want to hang out with him or if I have plans with other people.  You'd think he was five.

Even though he does nothing all day long he still doesn't do anything around the apartment.  I've actually boycotted cooking at my place until the guys empty the trash and do the dishes.  Brian's also taken to going into my room and sleeping in the afternoons.

I think that if I sat down and did it I could compile a very long list of horrible traits both of my roommates hold.

"event","We went to Rula Bula tonight and I realized how much I detest that pub.  We were all clapping along with Finnigan's Wake, 3 people got caught clapping at the wrong time and what happens... 1 claims that Paul has to buy him a drink and the other two don't fess up eventhough they were scene.  Grrr...  I think that you really have to know the band and there venues in order to truly appreciate my frustration.

Once last call is announced and Bula starts kicking us out (appx. 1:05) Charlie tells me that he told Shay how I asked him to leave 3 times on Thursday.  Charlie didn't know any of the details behind Shay's departure.  He didn't even know that I was driving him to the airport.  So Charlie decides to tell him that I wanted him to leave so I could sleep with him.  First of all I don't think of Shay in that way.  Second, Shay had to catch a plane in an hour.  If I'm going to be with someone I want it to last more than 15 minutes.  Charlie has no tact.  He told me that he'd set it straight with Shay, but I don't see that happening.  I'm going to the game on Wed with him, I'll set the record straight then.

"event","Even though I have a final tomorrow that I'm totally not prepared for I traveled over to my bro's for a Cinco de Mayo party.  It was like Mexico 2003 in Phoenix.  I truly appreciated the phone call at 1:30,""Cat, what are you doing?"" ""Working.  You?""  ""We started drinking about 2 hours ago.  We're going to start up a game of asshole.  You need to tell your boss you're leaving.""  Well I didn't have the desire to drink that badly.  I finally arrived 6 hours later and the alcohol was still flowing.  Good times were had by all in attendance.  
   Eventually, I decided to curl up on the couch and watch ""Big Fish"" with the guys.  Before the movie began and as the guys were getting baked, who calls?  Erik.  It was completely out of the blue.  I sat outside and we talked for a good hour, at least.  I think that either for my birthday or Memorial Day weekend the two of us are going to drive to Magic Mountain.  ""Rollercoasters are like sex.  They tease you and tease you until you reach ecstacy.""  ""That and you always wish that they weren't done so quickly.""  I haven't felt this giddy in a long time.  Actually, I think that he was the last one who made me feel this happy.
   I've had to wait for guys before, but this one's different.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but this one's definately worth it.  Let the countdown begin... 55 days."

"event","I'm sitting here waiting for my chocolate cake to get done so I figured that I might as well update my journal... 

   This year has gone very quickly and so many things have happened.  I look back in amazement at the rollercoaster I've been on.  The only true question is, ""When will this ride end?  When will I get a break, just to catch my breath?""  I must admit that if certain events would not have happened I don't think that I'd be as happy with my social life as I am now.  I also don't know where I would be this summer/fall.  I am content being an Arizona resident, but can't wait to graduate and travel the world.  I'm slowly seeing the US, but I need to see life outside of this realm.  I've been reading a lot of Abbey lately.  I know that his words have brought about my wanderlust spirit.  I have repressed it for too long.  There's so much that I haven't see and so many people I have yet to meet (not flirt with, meet!). 

        ""I'm shut off from the natural world and sealed up, encapsulated, in a box of artificial light and tyrannical noise."" ~Abbey  

   The only reason I regret moving out of my Mom's house is that I now am stuck paying rent and I can't just quit my job.  I also feel the need to get a second job, so I can support my passions, but then that restricts my traveling, photography, and rock climbing.  The vicious cycle of life.

"event","I just got back into town last night.  I had a killer vacation!  The first three days were spent enjoying the sites of New York City.  I have to thank Ryan once more for his hospitality.  To all the TC folks reading this... you have one awesome theater director this year, with really cute roommates.  He'll make you laugh, make you cry, and drive you to drink :P.  I don't know why or how Iain keeps finding these guys from Wisconsin, but they're all alike.  But anywho... after a night of insomnia and intoxication I met up with my Phoenix clan and we traveled into Manhatten.
   We mastered the subway system (which isn't at all as scary as I thought it would be) and walked around Central Park.  The architecture of the Park is absolutely breathtaking, thanks Mr. Olmsted.  Then we saw the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.  I also had a lovely dinner with Iain and Lisa.  It was nice seeing my camp crew again.  It gives me someone to reminisce with.
  The next day we traveled to MOMA and saw some of the most incredible artwork.  I got to sit and reflect while staring at some of the greats, Roth, Boccoini, Rothko, etc...  After that we went and saw the Daily Show.  It was fascinating seeing how they film the show.  Jon Stewart is really laid back and easygoing.  Arriana Huffington was the guest.
  We took the Amtrak to DC on Friday.  That night we walked around the Jefferson, Lincoln, FDR, and Washington memorial along with the Vietnam, Korea, and WWII monuments.  It would have been fantastic if it wouldn't have started to downpour by the time we hit the Korean monument.  We were drenched as soon as we left the Lincoln memorial.  Joy broke down and decided to hail a cab.  As soon as we got back to the hotel, I step out of the taxi and who's there??? Candace!  Out of all the people I run into in DC.  It was too funny.  I was going to ask her out for a drink, but figured that Mark wouldn't care too much for that :).
  The highlight of DC was the March.  I felt so priviledged and honored to be included in such an incredible group of people.  I have this large desire to go to the antiwar protest on campus today.  I also want to get more involved with Erin's Rock the Vote campaign.  The march was so empowering.  I challenge everyone out there to show up at the polls on November 2nd and let your voice be heard!
  I'm off to go catch up on school work... more to come later.

"event","Tonight I sat with Robyn at Denny's and managed to get nothing accomplished.  It had been awhile since the two of us could just sit down and talk.  I've come to a few realizations though:
  1) I really love the single life.  It's amazing how one single encounter can open up your eyes to this whole world you've been missing out on.  But on the same note, I need to tone it down at O'Connors.  All the 30 year-old men are kinda creeping me out, all but one that is :P.
  2) I need to find something else to do with my life.  I'm getting bored.  Hopefully, with this trip to NY and DC I'll be able to return with spirits renewed.
  3) I want a puppy or a kitten.  I really don't think that Robert would go for it though.  I figure that a dog would be easier to convince him of.
  4) When it comes to school I need to get focused and suck it up and deal.  Accept the fact that it's something I have to finish.  If it takes me 2 more years, than it takes me 2 more years.
Life's been throwing me through all sorts of hoops lately but some how I've managed to cope with everything that's come at me.  I'm astonished at how much one's life can change in a year.  To quote a brillant author ""My choice is made.  I must eat or be eaten, and I choose to eat.""  Victor Hugo

"event","Growing up I never thought that I'd ever be like someone on Cheers... You know going to the same bar every weekend, having the waitresses ask you how you're doing and telling you details of their lives.  It's actually quite funny when you have the band members not only sit with you while on breaks, but also join you for a sobering up meal over at Denny's.  I must admit though that it's a lot lonlier now that Iain's gone back up north.  I don't think I'll ever find another dancing partner quite like him, or want to.  I'll see him soon and that's my only saving grace.
Tomorrow's packing day and ""get your ass ready for school day"".  It's been a whole semester but I'm ready for it.  It's been one hell of a vacation, which I have no desire to ever repeat.  All I can say is that 2004 can't be any worse than 2003.  Then again I am moving out to Tempe and rooming with 2 guys that I prolly shouldn't be rooming with.  Life's an adventure and you can't pass up great opportunities.  As Miss Cathy says, ""Take a chance, you never know how things will turn out.""
For now it's time to go and dream of all these adventures I will dare to take.  Good night ya'll."

"event","So, I've been avoiding joining the journal bandwagon for as long as I could.  Finally someone sat me down and went, ""Hey, you've got to do this so I can keep up with what's going on in your life.""  (Happy?) So here's an update on my crazy life...

After a lot of harassing and bargaining, I'm finally moving out!!!  In two weeks I'll be living down in Tempe.  I'm so excited about not having to commute.  So anyone who has a truck that would be willing to offer their services would be much appreciated.  There's also a case of beer or a handle of alcohol in it for you (you call it).

If you haven't put two and two together this means that I'm going back to ASU.  I met with an advisor last week and she said that I have one more year if I get my act together this semester.  I can see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.

I think that's about it.  Work never changes.  Except I recommend to everyone that you get into an accident at work just to get the workman's comp.  I've been seeing an incredible chiropractor and massage therapist three times a week.  They're amazing.  Wow, that's all I can say about that.

I know it's a boring entry, but for those of you not able to go see the Clare Voyants with us tonight I'll tell you how wonderful it was, cuz it always is."

p.s. I need to stop putting myself in awkward situations lol 

Student teaching interview next week, wish me luck. 

Next week is the last week of class then exams. Wish me luck. 

After that I am visiting my Grandpa in NY for a few days. 

I think I am going to come down to Cinci for my bday then stay here until I start student teaching. I need Columbus friends to hang out with before my bday so we can have an early celebration. 

I think I'm happy. It took a while, but I think I'm really happy. Things are finally starting to go my way. :-) 

Gimme some love:-)"

"event","I have been very lucky the past few weeks. First of all, I found an old check for $125 when I was cleaning my room at my house. Then, later on when I was cleaning my room I found $60 in travelers checks (which is the same as cash). Then, in the mail I got a letter from CVS saying that I had an old paycheck for like $69 that I never picked up, so I am getting that reimbursed. On top of that, I am getting almost $300 back from my taxes. So woo for randomly getting lots of money (I needed it). While I have been lucky, I really don't feel all that great because I have been sick the whole past week. On top of that, I'm on my period, which is never a good combination. Today I have to go to the aquarium, then sometime this weekend I have to go to the zoo. Oh boy. I just hope I can make it through the rest of the semester. Just make it go away......................

"event","so funny story. My mom and I were packing in the living room and I was running wow on my computer but i had the monitor off. I thought I was in a safe place, but someone in wow started attacking me. And for those of you who don't play wow, when someone starts to attack you they grunt and make stabbing noises and such, typical killing noises. So my mom says ""oh my gosh what is that"" im like, ""oh someone is just killing me thats all"" shes like ""oh my gosh do we have a virus!"" 

....yes mom, having a virus on your computer sounds like someone is killing you/ your computer.

well kent is huge and id still be 2 hours away from home but in the other direction (and I could be with my adam poo poo) 

I looked at dayton before coming to Xavier- i think its suburban but not too far from downtown and like 50 miles away from cinci i believe theyre like 10,000 students but also private. they also have frats and sororities. i think that would be fun and a good way to meet people. 

UC- well they are my rival, but i wouldnt be too far away from tommy and i'd still be a good distance from home and i would be in the city. 

So i guess good and bad about each. 

I would like to take a year off and do like americiorp or something but i think that might be too complicated taking a year off but maybe i should wait till after i am out of college? 

Someone please, giving some advice or feedback or suggestions. any other schools i should look at? which of these schools would be best for me? what have u guys heard about these schools? do people like them? are they any good?  

Please if any one is out there.............

I have no friends and I feel like I am in high school all over again. I feel like I made a mistake going to a small school, theres not enough diversity and I feel like its not giving me the opportunities I want. I believe that everything happens for a reason, and theres a reason I ended up at Xavier, one- I know what I don't like and I can look back and see what I can improve on. second- I met tommy and hes an amazing boyfriend and I don't want to leave him. I'm really torn on what I should do. Could I take a year off and do Peace Corps or something of the sort? or would that be stupid to do after one year of college? when I chose Xavier I thought i would like it because I could start over and no one would know me and I could become a new person. i am begining to realize that i don't want to change who I am, I like the way I was, I hate who I am now. I don't want to continue being unhappy. i feel like a bigger school would give me more opportunities. people say you should wait it out if you dont like it first semester and see how it goes from there. Well i still dontlike it, i still dont have nay friends. these people just arent my type. is it too late for me to switch? i wish i didnt screw up in choosing a college. I don't know what to do. Anyone else been in this situation? well I know liz las. I need help. I need advice. I need friends :-(

The kids were kinda phsyco, had to break up a fight b/w the 3rd graders. some of them are hellians :-P then i got back and gave tommy his movie and he got me godiva chocolate. mmmmm cliches taste so good. truffles by the way. ;-) then we played some hexic (i swear im not addicted to that damn game) then  we went to white caslte. omg it was amazing. we got seated at a table with little flower shaped candles and a white table cloth and we got like a menu and they gave me a rose. then they took our picture under the white castle sign and gave that us as a keepsake. they brought us our food and stuff and then gave us cupcakes for dessert which was exciting. oh it was so yummy and i was so excited. I took pictures, I will upload them once i find my camera cord. oh and when i got in his car to go to white castle there were flowers there waiting for me it was so cute. then when we got back were like oh shit i hope they dont die. so he made a maekshift vase which is actually working pretty well. then we played some more hexic then watched contact but then i statred to fall alseep so i left. so update: im getting addicted to hexic, the marble game and Halo 2 on xbox 360. whoda thunk, me, a loser. :-P yeah so its good stuff. then i think im going home this weekend on saturday night. and while im up there im gonna help my mom at the food  shelter thingy with the homeless people so thats exciting. tommy might come up with me im not sure tho. i get to go to florida soon :-) so my history class got cancelled today which was exciting cuz i didnt want my test back cuz i knew it would put a damper on my day. and i didnt get my chem test back either which also probably would have put a damper on my day. i got my chem lab quiz back which wasnt as bad as i thought it would be i got like a c something on it so thats not too bad. still kinda confused on the whole chem lab report thing but its all good. so yeah. tomorrow night, benihanas (sp) im very excited. yummy in my tummy! :-) so things are going pretty well. im gonna take tommy shopping this weekend and buy him some nice clothes:-P i miss my kitty. well i think thats about it for now, thanks for reading if u did :-P peace ya'll"

"event","I open you up and place you in my hands. 
I welcome you back into my life by tickling the skin. 
I realize how much I have missed you 
Over these past few years. 

Your call is so inticing
that I can not say no. 
Your beauty is never ending. 
So let us dance. 

You lure me in 
By making promises I know you can not keep 
I listen any ways 
Because I have nothing to lose. 

Make me feel 
Make me feel goddamnit! 
I want to feel alive
I want to be.....

Dead. 


And more shitty poetry from the one and only."

"event","So apparently people still use the termanology: spooning, necking, smooching, courting........ yeah. 
So I was in Tommy's room last night. 
His roommate is all ""when you guys spoon, who's in the back!?"" 
""wait, what the hell does... spooning mean?"" 
""like when you guys are like cuddling or whatever"" 
""when we're clothed or not clothed"" 
""either way""
""I usually give tommy the inside so he doesn't fall off the bed :-P"" 
Tommy didn't find this conversation very amusing. 
I found it amusing though."

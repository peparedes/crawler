The obvious answer is not to watch it, but this is something I have to do, for me.&nbsp; Anyone up for going with me?&nbsp; (I already know you're not, Jess).&nbsp; I'm prolly gonna catch Miami Vice or POTC2 afterwards to de-stress a bit.

I am the girl who kisses her girlfriend on the sidewalk and laughs at those who glare.

We are the couple who planned and studied and got a damn good lawyer and BEAT the state that wanted to take our child away.

We are the ones who took martial arts classes and carry pepper spray and are just too dangerous to gay bash.

I am the transgender person who uses the bathroom that suits me, and demands that any complaining staff explain their complaint to my face in front of the entire restaurant -- and shares with my other trans friends which restaurants don't raise a stink.

I am the mother who told her lesbian daughter to invite her girlfriend over for dinner.

I am the father who punished his son for calling you a fag.

I am the preacher who told my congregation that love, not hate, is the definition of a true follower 
of God.

I am the girl who did not learn the meaning of ""homosexual"" until high school but never thought to question why two men might be kissing.

I am the woman who argues (quite loudly and vehemently) with the bigots who insist that you do not have the right to marry or raise children.

We are the high school class who agrees, unanimously, along with our teacher, that love should be all that matters.



If you agree, repost this. Do it. You don't have to be afraid. You can handle it. You're stronger than you 
think.

I am making a difference. Hate will not win."

"event","<P>Read BEFORE forming the lynch mobs!!!

1) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.


2) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.


3) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.

4) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.


5) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Brittany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.


6) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.

7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.


8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America. 


8.5)The Bible says gay marriage is wrong, just like eating pork, shaving your head, and having a bowel movement without washing your body and clothes and consulting a priest is wrong. Of course, nobody does that.


9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.


10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.

"event","That patient care and well-being come before the almighty fucking $$$ (OR:  How the Mental Health System Made Me Nuts)

I am on 3 psych meds and they are definitely NOT cutting it!  My doctors' office won't do my prescribing, even though at one point they said they would.  Now the PA is saying that he said they would pnly prescribe until I could find a psychiatric provider.  Whatever.

Catch-22.  

I have a therapist, one that I like AND trust (VERY important!!!)  

Most facilities that provide comprehensive psych care require that you see one of their therapists in order to see their psychiatrist (psydoc).  I don't want to leave my therapist!  Now there IS a psydoc at my therapist's office, but he is a fucking moron.

You cannot cut, crush, break, chew, or otherwise mutilate an extended release medication.  That's why the pharmacist puts the pretty little black-on-yellow labels that SAY: Swallow whole, do not crush, break, or chew.  Well, someone forgot to inform god...i mean my psydoc.  Then he pulled the ""Im the dr, your the patient; I know meds, you dont"" crap.  In the words of (omg Im dating myself) Homie the clown, ""Homie don't play dat.""

I cannot see a doctor who refuses to write TWO FUCKING PRESCRIPTIONS (for 300 mg and 150 mg) and instead tells me to cut some in half.  You don't even get even dosing, because the cuts are rarely even, but you know what?  If they weren't extended release, I'd have sucked it the fuck up.  Oh, this is the same doc who looked at my meds regimen coming out of Four Winds (he doesnt even think I ought've GONE) and says (not ASKS--SAYS) I'm changing this back to this (what HE had originally had me on).  No, you ASK me!  (My reply was- ""Um, no, you're NOT."")

So, back to the current situation:  I FINALLY get the director of MHU/BHU at GF Hospital to agree to give me a one-time consult for recommendations if my doc will prescribe.  Problem with that?  Doc doesn't want to prescribe.  I can kind of understand- they ARE GP's not psydocs, but wtf if all i need is a prescription written.

In the meantime, I've come so fucking close to winding back at Four Winds it's not even funny.  NOW my doc will write, for a VERY short period of time, because ""he doesn't want to see me back at hospital.""  WELL, DOC, YOU'RE DOING A DAMN FINE JOB OF <b><i>PUTTING</i></b> ME THERE!!!!   

Now, I MAY have found a psychiatric NP in Warrensberg.  I have to call in the A.M. and am praying to every god and goddess that is and ever was that I can get in there.  Because otherwise, I have only one small hope- changing dr's.  

And all the doctors blame the insurance companies.  Now I am all for insurance reform, but i ain't buyin in this case.  Because psychiatrists CAN see patients without requiring them to see THEIR therapist.  But that is where $$$ comes in.  I have Medicaid.  HMO but mcaid nonetheless.  They pay a whopping $17 for a one hour psydoc visit.  If I didnt have mcaid, I guarantee I would NOT have this issue!  And the best part--I asked if I could pay cash out of pocket when I get my loans in about 6 weeks.  It's apparently illegal to allow mcaid patients to pay cash if it is a normally covered service. (in other words, cosmetic surgery for strictly cosmetic reasons-that insurance WON'T cover, the patient can pay.  But something like therapy, which it DOES, the MEDICAID patient can't.  WTF!)

I am so sick of this system.  And the great part is that I will be going thru this the rest of my life.  Someone please pass me the gun now. 

 (YES i am joking)"

I slept 3 hours last nite, had to leave my house three hours befoe my appt cos of the GDCSMFin bus schedule!  So i sit here at ACC for 1.5 hrs before my appt, and will be back for 1.5 hrs AFTER it (thats more time than I spent on campus all last term I think!)

God just let me keep a minute shred of sanity.

Or as I say:

God:
Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\
The Courage to change the things I can
and the wisdom to hide the bodies of all those people I had to kill because they pissed me off!"

do her a favour, I said not if it involves LIFTING anything. Thats all
i said. She got all kinds of mad and got into my face and went off on
me (quietly).

"event","Dear Monica,




Two weeks ago, we offered the Republicans in Congress an opportunity.
The American people were watching, and we gave them a chance to show
that middle-class families are more important than their twice indicted
and three-times admonished Republican House Leader. <I>Thank you for adding your voice to our call.</I>




At the beginning, <U>only three out of more than 200</U>
Republicans who accepted DeLay's influence peddling money took this
opportunity to return the money and declare their independence. <U>That number still stands at... three.</U>




<B>So now more than ever, we have to keep up the pressure. More calls,
more e-mails, more petition signatures. Let's reach a critical mass!
Make them walk the line -- they can either choose to return the money
and stand with the American people, or keep the money and stand with
Tom DeLay -- the former Republican Leader who has been admonished three
times by the Ethics Committee and indicted multiple times by a grand
jury.</B>




Republicans got themselves into a bad spot through years of blind
loyalty to DeLay and his culture of corruption. Time and time again,
they've taken DeLay's dirty money thereby accepting the corrupting
influence of the DeLay, Inc. money machine and marking themselves as
DeLay dead-enders. But we are exposing them. Through the dozens of
local and national press stories we generated, hard working families
are beginning to know the truth.

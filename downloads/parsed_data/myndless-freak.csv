"event","well long story short. my mom slapped me and wanted to get into a fist fight but i wont sink that low to fight her back. so i slammed my door shut. and they took it off the hinges and took it away. and then i punched two big dents into my wall. then four more into my metal door. i didnt punch thru the wall though becuase i would have had to pay money for it."

"event","<P>Hello. My name is -Jake-, yes, Im a freshmen in highschool. Currently at East high school. I hate being a freshmen, not because of the fact that upper classmen pick on me, but because people underestimate me. Its so stupid how they do it. And I dont give a fuck eather for what they make fun of me for. Infact I just got outta gym 8th hour, and I stood up for my friend mark. these two upper classmen ""jocks"" as people call them (unlike me,I hate to stereotype) because they were calling my friend a ""goth"" and I told them if they were going to talk shit about him why not say it to his face? And they just kinda blew me off and copped off to me. I dont care realy what to many people think any more of who I am. Im me. And if you cant except me for who I am. then whey talk to me ,be friends with me, or anything to do with me. Judge me all you like. But Im me. You dont see me in the inside. Anyways. Im new here. I hope to get to know abunch of you, some of you may know me. And if you dont and your on my firneds list, thats because my friends anna (anna holz) told me just to add everyone on her list :) So I am doing so currently. <BR>Well leave me a comment if you like<BR>-Jake-</P>

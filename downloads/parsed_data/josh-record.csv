"event","so yesterday started out really sucky, because kelsey called me and said that her parents said that she cant drive into cedar park last night.  which sucks, because we were both looking forward to it.  so the whole day i was really depressed and irratable.

well turns out she called me after school and still couldnt do anything, but we talked about stuff, and then she called back at 9.  we stayed on the phone until about 2:30.  i looked outside my window and snow was coming down in blankets.  so being me i climed out my window and talked to kelsey while dancing in the snow. i took some pics, if they come out good ill put them up.  it was so beautiful.  God amazes me sometimes.  i was really down about not seeing my GIRLFRIEND, because of the weather, so i was pissed off at the weather....then it is like this and reminds me that everything God does is beautiful if you think about it.  its amazing.

well yes its official kelsey and i are dating again.  lol.  interesting how this all works. but all i know is that she is so amazing, i love everything about her.  i love her. its crazy.  she is so in love with Jesus its breath taking.  i love that.  she brings me up in my walk, though some stuff is starting to surround me that shouldnt be. lol.  shes amazing folks. thats all that needs to be said. i love her.

i look forward to messing with my soundboard and new room today.  good stuff, i will see my sister there right erica?   i love you all.  yes i do yes i do.

i love you kelsey too.

"event","kelsey is back. that makes me happy.  what would make me happy is getting to spend time with her during this week, but i dont think that will happen.  this weekend will be good though, i believe we are going somewhere friday...i hope.  
what i dont get is that i care enough to call someone/people....and they just take it as oh its just josh.  most of the time when i call you its for a reason...you just like to think that that is all i do while i am at home.  so i figure i will fill you in on what i really do but dont tell anyone because it makes them happier to know that they are right and better than me.  i go to school, i come home, homework when i have it, otherwise i clean my room.  i work more on my webpage for web design that is a major grade, keep working on my networking, and by the time those two are done it is 6 and time to eat.  then after that i work on my computer and my parents computer...i write, i play guitar, and oh yes i pray.  that may not sound too busy to some of you, and im not complaining, but my day really has no free time unless i want to do something, but something always gets shoved around if i do.  so just to let you know i sacrafice when i call you or when i hang out with you.  its a big deal for me, i wish people would respect me more. 
oh well....sorry thats just how i feel.  sometimes i am so sick of people.  the only people i dont really get sick of are anna webster and kelsey.  sure, anna and i get in lots of fights..but she...i dont know i just dont get sick of her.  and kelsey and i just click.  i love that girl shes so cool.  
okay anyway, thats all for now.  TWO14 band rocks.  eat dirt other worship bands.  our practices may suck beyond reason but God shows himself sundays. lol.  i love it and love being a part of it.
i love ya kelsey.

"event","so i just found this printed out in my room while i was cleaning it.  it strikes me as powerful, because i wrote it for guess who.  while she was in switzerland.  yes thats right.  the bottom part is current though...i added to it just now...enjoy taking my tears and blood and twisting them into your comic relief for the day

do you know that i miss you?
it feels for so long you have been gone
i count the days until your return
just hoping to see you once again
but time is inevitable
it has started, and will not stop
until the day when you return
then i will look into your eyes
and tell you how i feel
but must i share my thoughts?
must i waste this friendship
on impossible dreams?
to know that you care
that is sufficient to me
but why do i long for more?
do you cast your spells upon my soul
without realizing you are making me fall?
this dark hole, deep and treacherous
do i dare enter it again?
i will share my feelings with you tonight

youre back and those dreams have come and gone
shattered they have become to me
ruined and forgotten...
lost in your thoughts
found in my tears
felt in my heart"

"event","So, since everyone seems to be spreading rumours about me and kelsey i will set the story straight.

Kelsey and i met before she went to switzerland because of allison parkhurst, who by the way didnt even want us to be friends evidently.  we kept up through email the whole time and i grew slightly attatched to her.  Shes very cool and i loved her as my friend.  Well after talking one night on January 1st, we found out (surprise surprise) that we liked eachother.  well i got to talking and to make a short story even shorter we set up a ""date"" type relationship.  we talked about labels...and at first decided we didnt like them then we said yeah go for it.  i told someone (you know who you are) and evidently these 2 people told just about everyone else that they could.  and allison parkhurst got the information from someone besides me and quite obviously became some kind of jealous or angry.  so she got mad because she thought i was telling everyone that kelsey was my girlfriend, when in reality i said that ""kelsey and me are kinda dating now"" to two people.  two people that i trusted but now im not so sure. so eventually i told more people, but i had to go through the process of explaining our relationship....which was fine because i didnt want information to be twisted. after much thought and this weekend and God convicting me about it i decided to talk to her about it.  we both decided that dating isnt the best thing for either of us right now, thought we might have thought it was from the beginning.  it works out better like this because relationships screw everything up...like i dont do that enough.

so there it is.  if i get lip from anyone i am going to kick your ass.  i promise you.  you know who you are.  you were right, and i was wrong, but you had to let me learn on my own, again.  and i still know more than most people about this, so if you try and give me tips i will not listen to them because i know them already.  thats right, im saying im more knowledgable about this than you.  live with it.

this weekend was good, i will have to change things that will be tough, but bear with me, i love you all.  yes i do.  except for anna webster and erica russell.  love isnt a big enough word to describe how i feel about them.  they are my sisters and guys better ask me before dating them.  i didnt let them look after me and look what i did.  i wont let that happen to them.  

i love kelsey too, the amazing girl.  shes coooool in my book."

"event","eh...i forgot how much i like hoobastank. :-)  im listening to them right now.  lets see, its been a while since ive updated, so i will fill you in as much as i can.
Friday i went with some people somewhere but i cant remember where.  We had good times though.  Then saturday i slept in because i had no work because i quit! woo hoo!  and then at 4 went to the church for band practice which was incredibly long but turned out to be good cept that matt b sang the complete wrong song!  and ben blew the circuts twice in a row...yeah...oh well.  
Sunday was a good day.  I went to church, Jack in the crack who by the way got ALL of my orders wrong...pissed my mom off so bad she went back in there and threw the food at the girl! haha. go mom.  theennnnn me and KELSEY went out and ended up going to sonic and then played with her dog at the park.  *i wouldnt admit it was cute at first, but i love that dog*  haha.  then we met kayla and brittany at petsmart because kayla was getting her system installed and well we had nothing better to do with the dog.  haha.  i want to go out to eat with her next weekend, but wise eyes is the whole weekend, but everyone has school off monday so i am going to hook up with her then.  shes so fun to be with.  hah.  she is so pretty and enjoyable to be around, its great.  (not to mention she has a cute dog) haha.
alright this has been an okay day, though i slept through most of it. tee hee.  my web page is coming along nicely.  I am going to make 3 more pages real fast today and put it on the net soon.  so yeah look in my xanga profile for it or my AIM profile or here eventually.  i must be off to call the coolest girl ever and then work on my web page some more.  so i will talk to you all later!

nature stills for its coming
bow at its power and divinity
war will rise; destruction will begin
leaders of the earth will fall
confusion will take its toll
trampled corpses lie on the dirt
what madness is this?
that such would take the lives from the earth
and pull them into itself

A new order will arise
one bent on decay and destruction
choose not to bow and die you shall
kiss his feet and slaughter in his name
the world is his toy

We're going to family christian book store so i can get a new CD...but she doesnt have any money, but i think she will find some and buy something there anyway.  she loves that place. :-D silly hailey.  Silverchair is an amazing band.  The eisley concert is tomorrow, which is awesome, because i think i am going.  I dont have tickets yet though, so this could be a problem.  heh.  As a matter of fact, i dont think any of us have tickets cept probably kayla and brittany.  haha.  well this will be very interesting indeed.  maybe we can buy them at the door, they probably wont be sold out or anything.  i love eisley.  good stuff.  you will convert.
Kelsey and i have been talking a lot and i like it.  I think she is so cool, yall have no idea.  she means quite a bit to me.  shes hilarious. ;-)  and she's teaching me a lil bit of french, the most romantic language out there....so thats good, because i am a romantic guy. well i have to go help her with her journal, so ill see you all sometime later."

First, it keeps reminding me that my pop-server isnt responding.  no crap, i noticed that when i tried checking my mail.  so i restart...what happens? same thing.  i am also logged onto a guest account because i dont wanna screw with jacobs account, so i have limited access.  i am about to switch real fast i think and give guest full control.  it keeps telling me i have no more resources to complete the operation.  all i wanna do is freakin update!  and to top it all off, freaking it has the av.exe virus, and ive spent no time getting rid of it because well i am lazy.
On another note, i like talking to kelsey.  she makes me smile everytime.  i think that even if she was so angry she wanted to kill someone i could smile from that. lol.  i love kelsey. i am glad she is back.  heh.  cool girl she is.
And also, i like to hang out with kayla and brittany and hailey.  good times tonight.  but of course with kayla and brittany together something bad has to happen.  so i get coffee spilled on my pants and NEW PINK SHIRT.  that pissed me right off. that was courtesy of BRITTANY.  lol. oh well i love the girl anyways.  yeah so ive been doing a lot of thinking, but i wanna go talk to kelsey now.  maybe ill type it all later.

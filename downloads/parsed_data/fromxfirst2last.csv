"event","Last night was okay. After everyone left and I was by myself me n cortney kept texting each other back n forth till i got on the computer. we talked for a while and we both decided that we really missed being friends. i really did. Then we talked on the phone till like 4 - 4:30 a.m. and caught up with each other and found out stuff we have missed. She is going to talk to her mom about us being friends again because her mom doesn't like me very much. but this time i am going to be a better friend. i was a bitch last time. but yeah i sorta just woke up and i'm pretty tired... so i'm going to take a bubble bath n then go downstairs to dance. i get to see my scores on the evaluation today, so im siked.

"event","Today was an okay day. I spent it really with my two buds Kayli n Jay. It was cool. I ate a lot. We swam. We worked on the band semi. it was an okay day. but towards the end I just got sad. I miss him so much and I want to see him again. It's been forever. I don't feel complete now. I think Kayli n Jay could tell I was sad, but I don't think they knew what it was about or how to deal. its okay. this is my own battle. I don't know how to explain it. Its like... a fish without water... a butterfly without its wings... the sun without heat... the stars without its glow... its ... hopeless. Thats how I feel. Confused to do. I don't know how to tell him. He knows I like him n I know he likes me. But yeah. Problems with friends and ... best friends. 

I'll be up for a while.. thinking. the one thing i absolutly hate to do

I Love You .:.:.:"

"event","Oh my lord deep creek was so much fun. Jay n my daddy made it better! 

I got their and was so happy. So extremely excited. I couldn't believe I was actually back home. I showed Jay every room in the house. Then we unpacked. Me n Jay watched Forest Gump. My first time ever seeing it. I know.. I'm lame. Then me n Jay discovered the pool table. He didn't know how to play so I taught him. That was our fasination for the rest of the trip. But then my dad took us Jet Skiing and I drove some of the way and it was so ... peaceful. Then we were waiting for the dumb guy to tell us to come in and we flipped the jet ski over. It was crazy. I bashed my head off of it while it flipped though. This really cute guy who was really strong helped us all out of the water. We all got rust on us (hepitites! ah!) then we got in the car after drying off and I had the biggest head ache ever. So my dad went in the gas station and got me tylonal, snickers, n recies peices bites. They were good. Well my dad was going to take a shower and just chill out. So me n Jay played pool again. Then we decided to go to Uno for dinner. We got all fancied up and went. I ate so much. Then on our way out my dad showed us the Honi-Honi. It was a cute little bar with ""live performances"" (they were horrible) n then we went back home. Me n Jay played pool... yet again. And we watched Saving Private Ryan. Confusing movie, yet good. Second movie with Tom Hanks... he is amazing. Then me and Jay went upstairs and it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO hot. so we went downstairs to play pool and I got scared out of my mind.... i always was scared to go down their at night. Then we decided to sleep down their. I wrote in my diary and Jay called Kayli, I shortly fell asleep

Next morning I woke up early like... 9:00 and sat outside with my dad for a while. He went to the store and I woke up Jay. He had two bowls of cerial n I ate everything lol. Then my dad went golfing. We went on a walk, and we came back We played pool forever!! their were really hot guys across the street. Then we went upstairs and I wrote in my Diary again. Then we ate lunch... leftovers from Uno. Then we decided to go jet skiing again, so we went to get on the water and they said we coudln't get on untill 4 because of boats, so we went to ""Funland"". We played minature Golf. I suck at it. My dad got first, I got second, and Jay got third because he sucks (JUST KIDDING). Then we rode the go-carts. I almost died... litteraly lol. Then we went go get ice cream. Peaunt-Butter Fudge. Extremely good. So we ate that and we looked at Fire works. I was excited. lol. :: pyroooo ::  Then we got on the water and I didn't get to drive because the water was realllllly bumpy.. So we get back to the house and we got showers and just relaxed. My dad made us corn on the cob, baked potatoes, n steak. it was REALLLY good. Me n Jay watched IT. cheesey but yet good movie. Then my dad took us to put around on the golf corse. i liked putting. Jay kept laughing at me lol. Then we went back and finished IT. Then we went upstairs and IIII passed out because it was so hot . but before that i knitted. lol. im not joking.

We woke up and I coudlnt find my dad. it was like 8:00. I found his note saying he went on a walk. Then I woke Jay up because I was bored. I had a sandwhich. He came back and said we were leaving. So we packed all of our stuff and left. it was the best time ever. But right before we got home, we stopped at Perkins. very very very good. 

Now I'm home and talking to my very best friend Travis.

I did so much, yet nothing went as planned, and was the co-author to many inside jokes that will be the root of many chuckles under my breath when the unsuspecting says something.   Here is a list of the madness:
1.    How 'bout them Bangles!?!?!
2.    Wonder Twin Powers activate!!!
3.    That was totally emo
4.    d-d-d-d-d-definately
5.    Attack of the Samsungs!!!!
6.    I call the one on the left!!
7.    Careful or you'll get deported.
8.    That was depressing....
9.    Isn't that assholeish?
10.  This never leaves the room/car.
11.  DAMMIT!!!!
12.  Come watch the people with money eat.
13.  I think I almost started crying.
14.  No one understands me!!! *pretend to slit wrists*
15.  We need beer to go with my shirt."

"event","wachaa all!!! Hows it??  I have crossed the barrier from being a normal music person to being the 2021 song type person.  Its awesome.   I have had the crappiest weekend ever, yet its been the most awesome in a long time.  I literally did the same thing for like 4 days in a row.  I hung with my freshman buddy steve and that was traumatizing, yet v. cool.  But to simplify,  we had stalkers, then we stalked the stalkers, and obviously weren't good at that cause we lost them (both groups) then we watched an educational film on how to be emo, <a href=""http://www.somethingdirectory.com/main_emo.htm"">How to be Emo</a>  then became emo, and was too ashames so stopped that like 5 minutes later, and tomorrow we are going to Omaha to eat greek food and yea its awesome.  Updates, updates.... I found out that my two friends moms are like the wonder twins, but they will be the cause of the apocalypse.  In closing, HOW BOUT THEM BANGLES!?!?!"

"event","Well well, a whole 48 hours before me and my ""newly reunited friend"" started going at each others throats.  I thought I'd be the mature one and not let another friendship go down the drain, but obviously my views are different then hers.  At least I can say I tried, and now I won't have to listen to hour-long lectures hearing why my decision to choose or not to choose who I am friends with is wrong and looked down upon.  I guess I can see the good in everything.  Today I ran lots of errands, went to the airport to schmooze with the owners so they'd let me take a flock of freshmen there for their field trip, then I went to the mall, exchanged some clothes, and now I get to work on some computers!!!  I also had to pat myself on the back because the makeup test in western civilization took all of 4 minutes, and I got a 95%!!! This last weekend I was sick as a dog, but I need to watch what I say about that because certain audiences don't care to know about that.  I had a funny conversation with the banker today, we were talking about how I was the only one in the drive-through, then I said I was gonna tell everyone to go to the bank now, unless I got something out of them.  Then, with a smirk on the tellers face, she sent me a handful of those Wells Fargo sucker things, and told me to get out of her bank.  It was great.  Well I best be off, my clients need me.

"event","Hey everyone!!! Its been a while since I've updated, a long while; but alas, all good things must be brought back until I find something better to do with my time.   Not too many changes have happened since my last post, but overall, life is good.  I'm ready to get out of highschool, the drama is becoming such a suffocating burden and I don't have the time or evergy to deal with it.  I have decided I act too much like a forty-something year old to revert back to being a stupid teen, so I've given up on that too.  such a quitter I am.  On a brighter note, I=hmm, lemme think of something, whats been good recently, ohh I know!!!!  I've started talking to a long lost friend of mine and thats been awesome!!!  I'm out people!!"

Waltzing neighbors are the sign of the devil I decided.  Besides, neighbors are supposed to talk about weather, or borrowing a cup of flour, or to keep your fuckin dog off of their yard.  Well I have decided to toilet-paper his house as a student, not as a neighbor.  *runs to HyVee to buy ski masks and toilet-paper (the cheap-ass stuff not the Charmin)*  Other than that, I got my biopsy report back,  and I don't have cancer!! (Although we don't know what it is)  The wonders of medical technology.  Mechanical hearts but no answers for pain.  *dies again*  Anna, you will be very proud of me.  I'm off of EVERYTHING - no pain meds, no sleeping pills, no anti-anxiety pills, NOTHING.  Oddly, I can't quit shaking and I swear there are rabbits on my ceiling though.  Can't be because of meds right? *chases rabbits ""come here little bunnies, I won't hurt you""*  After the biopsy, I developed a lipoma, which is a noncancerious fatty tumor.  Its no real danger, just a lump on my leg, but it hurts so that means another operation to remove that.  *dies for the third time*  My mom thought that I'd like to know that my heart stopped on the operating table during my biopsy and they couldn't awake me after half an hour.  NIce to know huh?   I died once!!  For real doh.  Ok well I'm gonna catch those stinkin rabbits now, Bye All.

"event","Ahh doctors.  Unusual creatures they are.  I have seven prescriptions prescibed to do the same thing.  Don't get me wrong but I've been enjoying my hydocodone and darvocet just fine,  I just feel that they are trying to hide the answer to whats really wrong.  In 6th grade I had to do a report on how physical pain can manifest into other problems.  The recent events have only solidified my theories there - I'm on ativan for anxiety, naproxen and motrin for swelling, elavil for my brain-level adjusting painkiller, carvocet and hydrocodone for my local painkillers, and ambien so i can sleep.  Secretly i think that the pain is gone but I just don't know it because my docs keep me so drugged up.  On to better news, my lymph node biopsy surgery was a success, I'm already almost moving again.   The only quirk was that I was unresponsive to the drugs that were supposed to wake me up from my anesthetic coma.  Nice way to for them to say my body was shutting down on the operating table huh?  It isn't cancer, as they thought it could have been, and they are assuming its viral but they know its not gonna kill me so they are just gonna treat the symptoms.  k guys ttyl"

"event","ok ok I need to be less disobedient - my mom says ""stay home,""  I go to the mall and my friends house.  My doctors say I need to relax and not stress myself, I play ice hockey.  No wonder I'm still sick.  Oh well, if I die young, I want it to be while I was being a dumb, middle-aged kid.  Today was great.  I went to school and didn't die, I had friends over and I ruled in Halo 2 (I love my XBox, Anna) I went to the mall and ate chinese food, and then me and different friends came to my house, I ruled some more in Halo 2 (still loving it, Anna) and then I went to a different friends house, sat around, and then I went to the ice rink to beat some people up.  Well that didn't work but I tried... God I need to start listening.  Maybe I'll sleep for 18 hours and stuff.  K I'll ttyl.
P.S.  Anna tell me how to post pictures on LJ."

The 'Tempting Fate' meme: 

1. Make an LJ-cut post with ""DO NOT READ"" as the text.
2. Do not select a 'mood' for this post.
3. If anyone clicks the cut, they are to comment and admit to doing so.
4. Anyone who reads this also has to do the same in THEIR journal, thus continuing the neverending madness.

HA SUCKERRRRRRS!!

If you scored...

80-100: You've got a winner attitude. You're always optimistic and cheery. Your personality will get you far in life.

60-79: You have a good attitude. While a realist, you do see the positive side of most things. People love to be around you.

40 - 59: You have a positive attitude... somtimes. You prefer to see the world through clear glasses, not rose colored ones.

20 - 39: You have an average attitude. You take the good and bad in life as they come. Though sometimes you could use a little more good.

0-19: You have a negative attitude. You tend to see the dark side of every situation. Free ice cream? No thanks, it will just make you fat!

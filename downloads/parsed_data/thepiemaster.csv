"event","Seriously people, I'm getting into it. I went to watch my friend rap at a hip-hop show in Durham, NH at the University of New Hampshire tonight and ended up laying down some sweet, live, violin tracks on all the mixes. I don't know what even happened. The crowd went wild. It was weird and I definitely wasn't playing classical or folk or indie music.  This is going to be good. I think I'm ready for T.Pain.<br /><br />---<br /><br />So apparently when Lonesome Lake played in NJ a couple of weeks ago, we created some kind of stir. Here is the e-Mail Jeff, our bassist, received on Monday.<br /><br />&quot;Hey Jeff. Not sure if you're aware, but you guys created quite a stir when you played here a couple weeks ago. You're actually on the cover of a local paper called the TriCity News. But everyone who was here that night said how great you guys were. So we're glad you wanna come back. :) We pay for a headline slot, we don't charge a cover but encourage you to put out the tip cup and sell CD's. I don't think you'll have a problem promoting because people were talking about you guys and I'm sure the TriCity will put something in their upcoming events section if you ask. Anyway, below are the dates that are currently available although they fill pretty fast.&quot;<br /><br /><br />This makes me feel good about our band and our potential. Really, this NJ show was our smallest show, but has been the most fruitful of them all. Our next show is in Somerville, Mass., then back to NYC to play two shows. To bad Aaron leaves the morning of our show date. I wish he could see us play. <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/glue  ""> www.myspace.com/lonesomelake </a><br /><br />I think we will play in B-ton in the late spring or summer.  I don't know where we would play, I might just rent out the Buskirk, but really, that might be too big of a place."

"event","Our Lonesome Lake Mini-Tour was so great. Thank you Kit for letting us use your apartment as our Official NYC Headquarters and being a great Official Lonesome Lake Street Team President. By the way, I forgot to give you a shirt. 

The mini tour started with a long drive to the Millennium Music Conference in Harrisburg. We played at a venue with an older, very blue-collar, tough crowd. The good thing was after the first note, we won them over, the local paper and some music magazine took our pictures and interviewed us, and we were asked to come back next year.

The second stop was in Asbury Park, NJ at 2:00 in the afternoon.  It was a strange and extremely fruitful show. We actually played in a very small cafe, unplugged. The place was crowded. We ended up playing live on the radio and selling more CDs than we did the night before. Also, more of the listeners asked us for our card and contact information than bought our CDs.

The last stop was at The Living Room in the lower east side. It's funny because The Delicious is playing right next door at The Cake Shop tonight. Missed them by a day!  I hope to play there again later in the summer.

All in all, I was very happy with our first ""tour"" and our first New York show. I think our band has a good thing going and I can't wait to play out of state again and also start working on our next album. I'm a big fan of 
T. Pain. Our next show is this Wednesday at The Colonial theater in Keene. The Colonial is basically like The Buskirk Chumley, an old theater building right downtown with a big marquee.   It will be really nice, and my parents will be in town to see the show.

Our CD is for sale for $10, just send me a message if you want any. I'm still working on other merch lines for the band."

Well, what can I say? I've been here for a year now today. At my 6 month evaluation, I determined that I should stay a little longer to decide. I have decided. As of now in my current situation, as everyone probably knows, I will stay here in NH for at least 2 more years.

I really think its crazy. New life, new job, new friends, new love, new band, same person...I think. I don't really feel sad, I just remember good times in Bton with people I want around me, but are not.

I love you all. I'll visit sometime."

Being back in Indiana for Father's Day Weekend and hanging out in Bloomington was interesting. It's interesting to visit and not feel like you ever really left.  My trip seemed so familiar and comfortable as if I was gone for no more than a week. The sad truth is I hadn't been back in over 6 months, a span of time between visits to Bton that should probably be shorter.

Hanging out with everyone was great, but there is never enough time to see and visit everyone I wanted to. The party was amazing with fun games and bitter drinks.

I was able to spend some time with my parents.  I surprised them by just showing up at their house in the backwoods unannounced. It was really great to see how excited they were when they saw me.  I really love my parents.  They bought a yellow truck. I never thought my parents would ever own a truck and I never thought I would like its yellow color.

I did also get to go hang out with some friends up in Indy my last night.  I may have partied more than I should have. I can always tell when I've had a lot to drink. I start to squint more. Here I am with Lawrence and Ross. I never really understand how tall I am until I see my self in pictures. Maybe Ross is just too short.

I don't know when I'll be able to come back.  I'll be traveling in July, but maybe some time in August I should come by. My sister mentioned she wanted to celebrate our birth day's in Bton. I don't know. I guess we'll have to see."

It's interesting. I am not a coffee drinker. But when I occasionally do drink coffee it's either black or espresso. If I embellish it with cream or sugar, I usually get a headache. Another interesting thing about coffee is that it puts me to sleep.

I was so unproductive at work today. The majority of the time I just sat there, read the news, checked my mail, and AIMed. I need to find a hobby out here. I don't know what happened.

St. Pat's Cathedral was a nice place to visit. I really like the gothic art and architecture.

I need to go a buy new belts. I guess this is a good problem to have. I set out to lose some weight, and now my belts are too big. Hopefully I'll be where I want when summer is in full swing.

I wish I had a tripod when I was in the Cathedral. The other pictures I was able to get inside were great aswell. I really like this one, but I know it could have been better.

Uhh. 4 more days until the weekend. At the moment, my sister and Adnan are in Indiana visiting the Rents leaving me here all alone. I get so depressed so easily when I'm alone. I've been trying to cook, but when there is no one to cook for, or without a specific goal in mind, it just becomes more of a hassle. I don't know what I'll do if I move out and get my own place in this small rural town with nobody in it. I worry just thinking about it.

A weekend in NYC is always fun especially when you aren't by yourself. I want to move there, but I also like my current job. I think I need to stay here in NH for at least 18 more months with this job. That's such a long time!!! Ahh! I'm old and single. I need to find someone and go get married soon.

So early into my trip I've almost died, went on a blind date, and got third place in a random swing dance convention contest. 

It started with my flight yesterday. The flight went smoothly and was quite uneventful, until...  and it was a big until. Until we got close to Chicago. For about 40min, we had to circle around because there was a lightning storm over Midway. The ride was bumpy but it really wasn't that bad. Then the pilot said we'd be making our decent. Oh man! I've never been on a commercial plane that dropped out of the air so fast and that experienced so much shaking. It got really bad when I looked out the window at the back of the right wing. As I looked, I wondered how much stress the plane could actually take. Then I saw what seemed a bright flash as if someone took a picture. It was quickly followed by a loud band, and at the moment the, the baby two rows in front of me started crying, the guy to my left screamed ""Oh F@#$, we're totally F@#$ed!"" all while the guy to my right, an older man, was talking to himself and started crying. I though I was being punked until the captain came on over the PA system and told us not to panic and that we had been struck by lightning but none of our engines were hit and we'd be fine. I have seen a lot of things in my life, but this was the first time I have seen lightning from ten feet away, if that. It was kind of stupid, but the only thing running through my head at the time was that this whole time on the plane, I was filling out paper work for my new life insurance policy, and I didn't know how I would be able to turn it in before the plane crashed if for some reason the pilot could not get us down safely and that I was thirsty from the Ritz crackers I had eaten a few moments ago. We finally landed and surprisingly, it was a very smooth landing when we actually touched down, but just before we did touch down we were shaking and going a lot faster than we usually go when coming in for the final approach. We made it though, I as soon as we landed I walked down 4 gates and immediately boarded my connecting flight. I was so happy that I didn't miss my connecting flight and that I was going to get to San Diego on time for my 7pm reservations at Osetra. It was a close call."

A Girl in Milwaukee and a Girl in Brooklyn 


My wife is talking on the phone in Milwaukee
To her girlfriend in Brooklyn.
But, in the middle of all that, my wife has to go pee.
And it turns out that the girl in Brooklyn,
At the very same time, also has to go pee.
So they discuss this for a moment,
And they're both very intelligent people.
They decide to set their phones down and go to the bathroom
(This was back when people set their phones down).
So they do this, and now we have a live telephone line open
Between Milwaukee and Brooklyn
With no one speaking through it for about two minutes as
A girl in Milwaukee and a girl in Brooklyn go to the bathroom.

It has a decent stage and for how big the town is, it draws a pretty good crown. The point is, Monday nights are the open bluegrass jams. If I like what I see tonight, I might make it my default monday night activity and may even bust out Max and play along.

So, a person I know who just got over prostate cancer recently told that since his treatments and subsequent recovery, he just can't bring himself to eat beef anymore. This got me to thinking that I haven't made a pot roast in long while. It taste so good. It may not look good, but boy oh boy! It just melts in your mouth. You don't even have to use a knife.

Speaking of cows. Did you hear about the recall of 400,000+ pounds of frozen cow heads. Yeah, I just don't know how I'm going to ship mine back. They had better pay for shipping.

Well, with the boss gone the whole week, a lot of the decision making has been put on me. For some reason, when he leaves to meet with Corporate, I suddenly become the de facto leader. That plus all my regular work and all the meetings I now have to sit in on really  fills up my schedule fast. Instead of going out to have a nice relaxed lunch like I normally do, I brought my lunch to try and make the day go more efficiently.

Today I made a tuna and chick pea salad wrap, salad, and some cottage cheese.

Oh man, I finally made a lasagna. It's so great. I haven't made one in ages, the the only camera I have is my BB 2.0 megapixel. It's been great though. All my recent pictures from my trips have all been taken with it.

So every time I get out of my depression, I see something or someone that reminds me of that person with which I can't be with. Shucks, it really sucks especially when they call just to see how I'm doing, talk about what's new and how life is going. Isn't it funny how, when you hear their voice, you can see exactly what facial expression they're wearing? It would have been nice if it never went as far as it did. Know what I mean?"

Today we went to the store and bought a huge plastic jar of Honey Butter Twist Pretzels. They taste so good. Every time I pop one in my mouth, I imagine taking off on a mid-morning flight to some destination I've been wanting to go to. I guess it's because they taste like the pretzels they serve on those flights.

I haven't really cooked in awhile. I'm going to make a standard lasagna tomorrow. I really love making Canolli.

It's April 5th and that means a lot. In these days coming up I am going to have to make some very serious decisions, I think. First off, it's been 6 months since I moved out of Bloomington. I told myself that I would give myself about 6 months or so to get settled and to really decide if this is what is right for me. To really try and understand whether or not this is the direction I want or need to be going. Secondly, I have to decide whether or not I should move out of my Sister and Bro-in-law's house and get my own apt or to just go ahead and buy something. And most seriously of all, I have to decide about my job. 

At the moment, my job offers me great flexibility rapid and future growth, and a pretty good income. The problem is whether or not I like it enough or if the job is beneficial enough to justify me staying here in New Hampshire. The problem is I really don't think I have had the job long enough to really be able to make a good decision. I've been here less than a year, and though I usually know if something is right for me in a matter of moments, I have not had to make such important decisions like this in a way that is really effecting me the way it is right now. What I mean to say, is, I'm freaking out here and I just need to relax and ride it through a bit until I am settled down more and able to make a decision with less stressers weighing down on me. Ahhhhh!

I mean, really, what am I doing here? What should I be doing, and why should I be doing anything in the first place? Oh man, I need some tea or soup or some lasagna. I haven't eaten a lasagna in a really long time. What's really bad is that now, when I go to a sushi place, I am actually getting bored with the food. This is not to say that I don't like it, but I just have had so much and so good, that if it isn't at a certain level, I find myself really not enjoying it.

At this restaurant in San Francisco, the managers would wonder why the customers would laugh at the menu. Just read the menu out loud with your best FOB Japanese accent. It's really funny.

Uhh, I don't want to go back to the snow. This weekend, though, I'll be in NYC attending an auction. I can't really afford anything at thee auction, but there is a Strad I want to look at up close. It's just awesome to hold something like that in your hands.

Packing

So I leave in a few hours for San Francisco for 7 days. I wanted to buy a new camera so I could take pictures of this trip, but I think the weather may be crappy the whole time I'm there, and so I feel less inclined to get one. Anyway, even if it does rain the whole time there, it sure beats the icy cold wind here in New Hampshire. It will be a nice break. Furthermore, since I won't be meeting anyone I know on this trip, and since this is a solo mission for the company, I'll be a alone and be able to let loose and go crazy and get buck wild out on the town. Anyway, as of now, I have no camera. If anyone reading this is going to be in San Francisco in the next week or so, give me a call and I'll buy dinner."

Open Mic


So, after much protest, I took the stage last night for the first time since the last The Hot Carls show that I was a part of. It was a place like the Player's Pub, except bigger, a great sound system, and filled with more people. Still an even ratio of college aged and middle aged people. I got to that point of my drunkeness where I was relaxed enough not to have my voice tense up and still be aware of myself.

It was weird to be by myself alone and not even with my violin. I just had my six string. There was a spot light on me and the whole place was very dark, so I couldn't see anyone. I sang 4 songs. The first song was a great attention getter. People actually started listening. When I started the second song, ""I Shall Be Released"", the place started clapping. Again, very weird and something I thought only happened at the Pub. I didn't play ""The Hand of the Almighty"" for obvious reasons, but when I was done I felt really great/empty and there was a great reaction from the crowd. A group even bought my friend and I a pitcher of the local beer. It all felt strangely familiar. Only, while it was going on, I felt so detached and felt so sad as I looked to either side and didn't see Matt or Jonas there. I wanted to leave amid all the celebration and the prospect of making new friends, but the sound man ask if I do another song. I played ""Only You"" and to my surprise an old couple got up and started slow dancing.

I played sad slow songs very sadly. The crowd liked it. I'm going to go to sleep now.

Resting

It's funny. You're absolutely right, I can do better, and have done better. A lot better. Why put myself through that whole ordeal once again. I know what will happen. Dang Gina! What was I thinking? Now I just need to go and get what I want. Shoot. That's how it usually happens. Did I forget? I don't know. I just needed a little reminder. What a pal. Thanks.


Ha! The bank won't grant my request to increase my credit. It's funny. I've never been in debt, and because of that, it is hard for me to get credit. Shoot, there are ways. I've just maxed-out the card I already have. In about 2 months, I'll request an increase again. Hopefully, they'll see that I've been making my payments regularly. I need to get my credit just a little bit higher so I can buy my car with my card so I can get my Skymiles so I can fly to her and win her back. Muh ha ha ha. I need to buy more stuff, fast!

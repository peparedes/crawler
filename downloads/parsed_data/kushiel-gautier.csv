It is only difficult to put into parchment all these things that have happened when sleep claims me so deeply every single night. It is said&nbsp; life only gets busier for those of us who live it, so I suppose&nbsp;I am more alive than ever.&nbsp;

What can I say?. There was the whisper of a song that only grows louder in my heart. I sang it once, if quietly, and I doubt the ears that heard it understood at all.&nbsp; I am not sure I do. I wrote about a choice the last time, and I know now that I had made it already. We fight again and again, but now I think I can see why. It doesn't worry me so much any longer as it does the fact that she would not say it to begin with.&nbsp; I am used to make my own conclussions and test them, but it is difficult without enough information and&nbsp; she holds it as close to her heart as I do.&nbsp;

I also made one decision I would not normally have made, but there are debts in there too. The price was paid, not just in gold but in understanding and in grief. H. L. may laugh now, or grieve himself, I do not know.&nbsp; I wish I did. She told me it was as if she was not there, how could I say she was right? Sometimes it is best to change the subject, and I had good teachers on that. It hurts her, too. To know of it. How the rumors started eludes me, because I trust most&nbsp;in my house like I would family. Most.&nbsp;

There is always more. Another surprise, and another heart to deal with. What changed the starling's mind I do not know, yet in the end it doesn't matter. It is there, and to beheld, Companions help us all, and his Lady of Tears too. Yeshuites walk around speaking of loving one and only, I once would have seconded that.. now I can't say the same. There are all kinds of love, and it is much like with you at times. That kiss still haunts me, but now I welcome the memory with a smile. What if?. I dare not imagine. I cannot afford to.

Then a scream, and I remembered how it was. A true scream. Has it truly been that long? 

And Genevieve will probably be out for my throat now, but I do know now she can simper. That ought to be worth it."

"event","Exhausted. 

I walked, I ran, I fought against myself and the world. I bathed, I even talked some. I think I worried Marcello to death for a moment as well. 

I can't move a muscle, and still I can't think of anything else. 

What is it, then? It is too late to deny, yet admitting it would be placing one I love in the same position I was in for so long. And perhaps I fear, too. What if her choice is different from mine? Some things I may not be ready to face now that I was then. The stakes are also much higher than I want them to be. I thought I understood you yesterday, today I know I hadn't. I wish it had taken longer, too. That we could have kept living in a dream one more day. One more week. One more year. 

And perhaps in the end it doesn't matter. Whether we admit it or not, the elephant is in the room."

Running down the streets and feeling like exploding with energy and laughter.&nbsp; To find your shoulder and your smile, and just share without speaking. Only this time the shoulder was smaller, and the smile much wider. I've wondered sometimes if that was how he came upon you, but then some things we'll never know.&nbsp; Coincidences never are, as messire Bergier would say all too often. It is true.<br /><br />Wherever they are leading me now, I will thank them. For the flowers, and the grass, and the joy. For letting me know there is still time, and that perhaps if some things are never to be the same, others will make up for them. In different, strange ways at that, but they do.&nbsp; There is, indeed, a thin line between punishment and reward, and at times it is hard to tell which one is which. Until later.<br /><br /></div>"

"event","A small flower is pressed here between the pages, protected only by a thin layer of silk.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut""><br />Jeanette seemed to like the small gift I gave her. Her mother's came as well, without a trace of where from. I&nbsp; made all proper inquiries of course, but I may still lack H.L.'s refinement when it comes to getting information without showing any personal interest in it. Is she hiding? Does she even know either of us is back?. I have been spending far too much time in Her temple of late, but Josephine doesn't seem to mind the added responsibility. She is actually growing fond of it, I think, and she knows the younger courtesans far better than I do. I am learning about them, though, and they make me smile at times. I feel more at home perhaps now. <br /><br />The rains continue, but they are warming now. The key weighs in my pocket sometimes, but I find excuses to ignore it. Enough, I think, that I forgot for a time just what to do with it. I was reminded, though. Under the mantle of&nbsp; clouds and the surge of their downpour the answer came to me, and perhaps it is not what I would have chosen it to be. You would have asked why I was there. Or not, you probably would have known before I did. Lust always makes things look easier than they are. Here's to the easy path, my heart.<br /><br />On the other hand, I found another bloom today. This time on her desk. My desk. For once the meaning is not clear to me, and that is unsettling enough of itself. It's been too long, I no longer turn to every arrival the way I did at first and the sight of a fur cloak doesn't set my blood to racing. There are much less of those about nowadays, in any case. I keep trying to decide which song to offer to the comtesse, and who is to sing it. Renaud would always be a good choice, but he will play the tone-deaf game just to goad me into showing him the right timbre. It is what I would do, in any case. <br /></div><br />"

There are a lot of things I don't really need. My old friend is right, I could seduce whoever I wanted to seduce, but I have always placed the limits myself rather than having them placed on me. Perhaps that had something to do with my reaction to the Starling's taunt.<br /><br />Can it be like it was again?. I shall try, of course, but we both know things have changed. Was it like that for you at all? I am inclined to say it was not, but that is because I am selfish after all. In all my life, I think you were the only thing that was truly mine, even if it was only that very second of understanding. Or mayhaps it still lasts. It certainly has costed us all enough.<br /><br />And speaking of costs.. I can't believe he&nbsp;would tell of the song. Or I can, if it was pride. The alternative is a lot more dangerous, and I am not sure I want to contemplate it. If I had wings, my brother... It&nbsp; is the third person who wants me to sing again. It isn't as if my voice was that impressive then, but that she liked it. Mayhaps it was the words. Or the longing.&nbsp; In a way I still long for you, but I am not ready to find you again yet. Now I know that. I have still things to do here. Things to set right.<br /><br />And mayhaps something else to long for. <br /></p>"

After all that has happened in the last few days it was obvious that we share more than a heart.&nbsp; Mayhap he has seen a glimpse of what I tried to say, and if it brings them closer it won't be my loss. It hurt parting with it, of course. I almost did not for a moment. It has been said that love as thou wilt means there is not to be jealousy among us, yet over and over again it continues to prove false. We are still part human. We still want things for ourselves. Our own.<br /><br />Mayhap I understand you more as I go through this. The extent of your choice and the reasons for it. The extent of mine.<br /><br />Sometimes we can't just stay untouched. Probably never in truth, if I am to judge by what I know. I didn't expect to be joined there, but I must admit to hope. Hope springs eternal of course, or perhaps it was relief. There, for the time being, I remembered what it was like to be myself. Before we left. Before their choice and yours would force mine. When there was the song of two courts together, and laughter. I wonder if he remembers sometimes, or if it is just all water under the bridge flowing away. <br /><br />And then to see the seeds flourish against the fire. In the middle of winter and the howling wind outside. The conviction and the pride I glimpsed once growing in front of me to be seen ahead. It is true. It may be a Kusheline court, but we are Naamah's as well and it might be known again that Elua shines between the two. <br /><br />Perhaps today I can also say ""I am happier now"".<br /></div>"

So many things have happened since then that make the simple drawback of that responsibility a laughable one. I haven't announced it openly, only to those I spoke with at Cereus. That was an interesting morning as well and the source of much as well. I wonder if Renaud's wager goes any better than mine is now. <br /><br />I doubt they knew when they set on the starling to carry it out, or what she would choose to bestow in order to achieve their win.&nbsp; It was a fair win at least, even if its price was higher than they know. I saw my fox laugh, at least, and couldn't remain angry for too long. I feel however that the cost will not be as much for me to bear as for her. Will she ever be able to look at me the same way again? Or more importantly, will I?.&nbsp; I offered her truth at least in the end, and whether she takes it for what it is or what she wants it to be shall be her choice. At least that was the third thing I had to set to rights.<br /><br />The first was before it all,&nbsp; after the showing when the Fox left and I had the last conversation with Maylea about it. She would be leaving the next morning at least. Her.. I don't know yet what to call her at times. She came in to ask for more advice and I think both of us found a measure of absolution without either breaking promises or paying for secrecy.&nbsp; The second is a debt acknowledged and paid. Or near paid. The nature of woman always brings me to smile when things like this happen. <br /><br />And then there is the fourth and last. For now.&nbsp; I have already sent the request and finished the last touches to it. Hopefully that shall be soon.<br /></div>"

"event","<br />Decembre 20th, 1185<br /><br />In the wake of the Progress.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut""><br />The return felt faster than the way to Kusheth at least. I was looking forward to home, but perhaps I was looking forwards too hard. In retrospective, with all that happened in these few weeks I feel that it was all worth it, and even loss has a way to give of itself. The Starling's gave her a reason to look deeper into herself and to learn the limits of what she can ask or refuse to ask.&nbsp; That was one of the longest nights in my life, I think, with her curled in between us. She will grow stronger from it, and so shall we.<br /><br />You said once it isn't enough to love, one has to trust as well. It is difficult after all this time to even try again. It happens though, little by little. Paths converged and diverge as well in the closeness, and it was sometimes so difficult to tell which one I was treading. Mayhap that there is none but the one I open and carve for myself.&nbsp; Sometimes I don't know if I move too fast or too slow, either, but at least I know I move forwards. The price was high for all of us, I believe, and it will be paid for a long time. I can only try to make it hurt less.<br /><br />My Raven has lost something as well. I see her trying to find it again blindly&nbsp; but I doubt she realizes what she is looking for. On the other hand, it was the worst time to seek my help on it. Perhaps some day soon when things quiet down and both of us can forgive and understand. The other worries me as well. She is young and perhaps not quite as understanding of the ways of court as I am. Or perhaps I am just too jaded. But I see her happy and untouched now. There has to be more to that, and whatever the consequences are to be. Perhaps I shall talk to her. When there is time. And that is something I lack right now.<br /><br />Fabrics, costumes, masks. Things are all ready right now for the evening and yet I can't help but worry. She still won't say it, and the distance has grown greater ever since we last spoke. There are things deeper than I can reach, and her pain is of a kind that can be only healed from within. We all make bad decisions sometimes, even I.&nbsp; And then I grow busy, taking on one thing after the next. Josephine helps, and so do the others, but I can see them all looking up to me.&nbsp; If I ever see Solaine again, she is truly going to hear me. <br /><br />And there is this letter, too. <br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Decembre 21st, 1185<br /><br />The Longest Night<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut""><br />It was beautiful. Just like I remembered, and just like I had dreamed of for the last&nbsp; fifteen years. Cereus white and bright like Cypres' dolls, though he was not there. I wonder about that, but perhaps he was the Sun Prince.&nbsp; Either way I will find out about that tomorrow, I couldn't stay. We walked in hand in hand, and with the others behind us, but the one her eyes sought was not there. The ballroom was delightful, and little by little it filled in with the rest of the houses. So beautiful.<br /><br />The inspiring Muses from House Gentian, the soothing Herbs from Balm, The bejeweled glitter of Bryony. The Valerian prey and its Mandrake Predators.&nbsp; Genevieve was herself. In a way it was fitting since she couldn't hide behind a mask if she wanted to. Wolf and Stag could not make a better match. Precious stones have always made a wonderful gift, at least H.L. was rather generous with them. These looked like rubies this time.<br /><br />Alyssum always reminds me of us. So understated and then so complicated.&nbsp; The breeze against the flowers and their reaction to it was such a contrast against the eglantines that followed with their boldness and their voices together, I wanted to join once more.&nbsp; Hanzu touches in the costumes and the shape they formed, one of their fantastical creatures were complemented by those of Dahlia as well, the Hanzu royalty with flowing silks and straight, careful motions.&nbsp; Heliotrope. Peter and his attention span brought the women as men. At least he didn't dress the men accordingly or it could have been hilarious. Perhaps I should suggest that to Renee no Orchis for next year, though they did rather well with the pixies and celebrants. <br /><br />Jasmine was as beautiful as ever on their Bodhistani guise. It is interesting though that some of them have started to wear these throughout the year too. Maia's influence was strong on that respect. Perhaps next year they will regale us with something different and unexpected. A menekhettan entry for the darker beauties, or perhaps something in the area of raw sensuality. I don't know. A strong sense of diirection might work better than their current state of things. I thought I saw Kalyani for a moment. Right. If I keep&nbsp; seeing things, next time I will see Solaine. Or you.<br /><br />Either way, we watched and we talked.&nbsp; After she left I waited for her call and then we talked some more. There was something there for a moment, and perhaps some hope, but I don't think it will happen for quite some time now. She must come to terms with it by herself and there are some things even I can't help with. It is not as if I didn't expect it. On the other hand, my decision was made then. I didn't go back to the ballroom and came here instead. And now I move on. No contracts tonight.<br /><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Decembre 22nd, 1185<br /><br />In the Morning.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut""><br />Sometimes they make the choice easier.&nbsp; And sometimes it is us who do it, or mayhaps there is no choice to start with. There is always the Camellia trap, too, but if I am ever to fall into it it will be because I want it to be so. And no, I am not just telling myself that., I am not that senile yet after all. Somewhere within I am Bryony as well. I relish playing with fire. Maybe I walk too close to the flames at times, but it is worth every second of it now. And then that just might have been what you meant, too. In a way.<br /><br />The leaf turns now, and the next page is all blank. I just stand now like he did and wonder what it will bring next, if it is I who will need your hand now, knowing it won't be found. Or will it?<br /><br />Joie.<br /><br /><br /></div>"

But now, I am only left with pity and sadness that he would feel strongly enough to try to hurt me that way. Like a child throwing a tantrum, let the Robin take his plastinx and go home. I have more pressing things to worry about now.<br /><div class=""ljcut""><br /><br />I have seen that touch a few times now, and neither time was it good. With Gianella the surprise was quick to turn into grief, and I rather not think now about beautiful Khari. I watch her now, well enough so that it is would serve to give some confirmation to those unfounded rumors. Some time ago, it would have been enough for one to state the truth, but I think this court is different in that. As are we. <br /><br />The day started well enough other than that, really. I even apologized to Lunaire, and I don't quite know why though it seemed to work, back then. And then MiLady sat to have tea with us, and Marcello was his charming self. The Kusheline Duc joined as well, and the Fiery one stopped by. Wearing Pants. What is it of late with women and pants?. It is as if I were to prance in a corset and petticoats, not only humorous, but ugly in itself. Some lines should not be blurred.. at least not without a purpose. I can see you laughing at me already. It was never like that. But that was the high point of it.<br /><br />When I went for some refreshments for MiLady he was there. They both were. And an adept, I think. There are some things that we can't quite help ourselves from doing, I think, however subtle the sarcasm or sharp the blade. I must admit to starting it, and got paid in quite the same measure at that. Sleeping on horseback indeed. Fortunately, I have better things to do than dwelling in the past. And then the robin was there again, though I doubt he even noticed a thing. Mia Ragazza would have noticed too much I think, I am glad she was not there.<br /><br />He asked for a word, and we spoke at length. Once again, I said too much. I don't think he understood the half of it though, which is probably why I endeavoured to be clear. As it is, being accused of dishonesty and hiding will not do much to get on my good side. It is interesting too that much like Mireal, he seems to expect me to know just what he is talking about without specifying it. And he could be meaning so many things. It is always the narrow minded that I find hardest to work with. On second thought, it is as if each time he tries for humor it has to do with desire and should I return it he just becomes upset out of it. He does not understand restraint, I think. Or why we would choose not to lay with every one that catches our fancy.<br /><br />I suppose you would know where I learned that.<br /><br />Why I even tried to explain it is beyond myself. I knew he would not understand. He accuses me of holding back from what I love best, but how can I explain that what I love best has little to do with what he does?. Or perhaps we are both misunderstanding each other as it happens. Once again he took it personally and left. <br /><br />Then later on I tried to talk to Evangeline, and Adela was there. She looks much better. The one who doesn't is the FireHound. She is just as before speaking of things she knows nothing about and now apparently it is my viper's tongue that is causing the man to leave. It is funny how some people will ask for the unveiled truth and then call it poison when it hurts. <br /><br />I left the way she came, and found what I was looking for. He wouldn't answer my questions and I would not repeat them, so we stood at a standstill for long enough. And then the Fox came in, and it all imploded as one. Some words cannot be taken back, and his were vile even as they hit gold. Like the first time. I don't know now if he is just that perceptive behind his own facade or simply lucky at his guess. I certainly hope it's the latter, because I truly wanted his head on a platter after that. Not that I would have done. And then, I realized I was not the only one. In a way now, I Pity him. And pity is the worst thing a D'Angeline can feel from another. I have to work on that.<br /><br />And here I am, saying I wouldn't write of it, and already filled pages with this blabber.

Flowers are what we are, and we all express it differently. He called me a laburnum and then apologized for it. It was interesting, because it was closer than he will ever know. His friend, though, was not quite as sharp.<br /><br />It is funny to think sometimes that certain women think they will shock one by the simple divesting of their garb. I have seen more hair than that in Aragonia. She takes things said to and about others as if they were said to her, and it can be interesting to imagine what she will do with them. But then I have learned more about her of late, and it is more than expected perhaps. I can see why he would choose her, and it amuses me to no end. Aside the hair and the birth, there couldn't be two women more different in the world. And then perhaps that has something to do with it as well.<br /><br />Lunaire brought me some peace offerings as well. One of them was her portrait. It is beautiful truly, he is talented enough. I wonder if I should place it in the chambre de soleil to replace that which my raven tore to pieces, but it is perhaps an idle thought. It wouldn't quite so much go with the decor. I must admit I was short with him once again. Perhaps the more he tries to get closer the more I push him away. He calls it arrogance and pride, I suppose after all this time I forgot that not everybody can understand my humor. He hovers, he wants. I could like him. in a way I do. He is all that I am not after all. Sometimes I wish I could just forget what I know and who I am and be free to think only about distractions and painting and pleasure. Were I who I was once, I just might have. Or maybe not. He is not a patron after all. <br /><br />I shouldn't have told him so much. Some can't quite understand that duty can also be love.

On the other hand, Maylea is back as promised, and will stay in the house for now rather than coming with us. She'd probably want it to be otherwise, but won't protest. At least if she did I would have an excuse to stay.

A price is always set, however ephemeral or intangible. Is it the coin that seals the worship or the act of paying, in whatever form that comes?

And why do I feel like singing?"

I have been more tired after an assignation at times, or even after a day with you. It didn't matter, though.

With&nbsp;the weight of house and&nbsp;misdirection crushing upon her shoulders,&nbsp;the Cereus flower does little but&nbsp;to add&nbsp;to the weight as usual. I suppose she means well, but it is still so wrong. Perhaps we should talk again soon.&nbsp; 

It brought back too many memories of course. From restraint to want, to touch, to kiss. I still hate you for that kiss, and yet I would have not had it any other way of course. I had to admit to myself that I wasn't being so different in my choice either, and other decisions need to be made.&nbsp;

Words build companionship faster than touch or longing. And friendship. 

Her strength is becoming more and more self evident, at least when I look now. And thanks to it I feel stronger myself. Like a Circassian Walnut Tree. Yes, I can imagine you laughing too, and wonder what H.L. would say about such choice. Perhaps vines are more appropriate after all.

""What if you meant it"" The question still resounds in my mind, again and again. I suppose she is used to see people hear what they want to hear just like I am. I think all of us with this calling are. We don't expect to hear anything, but are open to the possibilities and probing.&nbsp; It is always the heart that does it after all.&nbsp;It is her view of the unexpected that makes me smile still.&nbsp;

Perhaps I can forgive.&nbsp; 

I think my answer was fitting, though, and even if it may have caused a few eyebrows to rise it was well worth it of course.&nbsp; I saw Maylea through the corner of my eye as ran. It matters not. People will talk, but one would expect what happens in Camellia to stay between its walls. It mostly does. There was the rush of course. The breathlessness, the laughter. Ah, to hear her laugh is such a treat. I shall endeavor to be more Orchis at times I think.&nbsp; More everything.&nbsp;

I heard her give good advice again and seconded, who knows, it may bring good after all. It is interesting that she got me to speak of things I wanted to keep to myself. She knows her task well of course, or perhaps it is true that I needed to let it go. Sometimes not even I can wrap myself in riddles, and some things come out whether I want them or not.

It happened just after my conversation with my doe as well. I remember talking about the division with her, and she sensed things were wrong without my need to tell her. Fortunately she won't pry, yet perhaps I was hoping she would. How could I tell her any of it?. Perhaps she doesn't need to be told. On the other hand, I did speak of Amarante's thoughts to her, and it was somewhat of a relief to hear her agree with our assessment. But not as much as it was to actually speak her name at last to someone else. Perhaps that is another of the walls that separate me from the Ragazza. She doesn't quite understand, and likely won't.

At one point I pointed out my impression of things, I stand by it. It feels as if&nbsp; the houses are separate rather than the integral parts of Mont Nuit. Perhaps it is just my perception jaded as it is, but I still cannot help but comparing one or two to simply competing brothels like those in La Serenissima. ""And yet in La Serenissima, it is coin that the men and women offer themselves for, and coin alone. Not worship. When they search for the divine they look to the sea, to the sky. Not the force of their own love.""&nbsp; Love. Yes, I suppose I do in a way. Every time. Just not the way I'd like to.

I am proud she'd come to me now, and even more proud of her for understanding what most don't do these days. What is the value of a marque when it isn't earned with experience and joy?. It devaluates all of ours in the end, because when those who would seek experience and knowledge do not find it, what will they think about the rest of us?.

The most interesting part is that she took the gift of coin as an insult rather than the honor it was meant to be.&nbsp; Amarante told me once that she had the heart but had not managed to understand the philosophy behind their canon.&nbsp; I don't think I truly realized until today just what she meant.&nbsp; And perhaps just how much of it all was what I wanted to believe rather than what it was.

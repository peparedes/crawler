"event","Also, about my ""weekend"". Apparently my weekend next week is Monday and Tuesday. Ideally I would get my ass in my car tomorrow night once I get off work at 8PM and drive to Bellingham in time for Fetish Night and spend the rest of my weekend up there. The only problem (as usual) is gas is fucking expensive and I'm trying to save up for moving. But if you know of anyone who needs to get to Bellingham Sunday night (tomorrow) and is willing and able to contribute at least a decent amount of gas money I might be able to do it. Or if I could get a ride and give someone some gas money, but I would have to figure out a way back down here before Wednesday morning also, since I work Wednesday afternoon.

      If Bellingham doesn't work out then Seattle area people should hang out with me. Did ya hear that sexy bitches?!"

"event","Last night I saw ""Dark Knight"" with my room mate, Terry. It was so frickin' good, and in ways that surprised me, and even poked me in the brain a bit and many quotes that made me go ""Ha! Take that American culture! Brain poke to you, bitches! I can't believe they went there"" Go see it, if you haven't already! I find it ironic that my favorite characters in the movie are The Joker and Lucius Fox. Opposite ends of the spectrum in many ways, though I'm not entirely sure what spectrum I'm talking about, moral I guess, for lack of a more specific/accurate idea. I'm so glad Katie Holmes was not in this one. In ""Batman Begins"" she annoyed the piss out of me, to the point that it was distracting from the rest of the movie. I'm glad Maggie Gyllenhaal(sp?) was in this one. She's adorable. I love her. Heath Ledger was amazing, holy crap! I could say more without giving anything away, but I'm at work and shouldn't be posting anyway. Terry liked the movie too, and she was surprised that she did. I wasn't. I thought she would like it."

"event","Okay. I want to post things that have happened too, but right now I want to post about the fact that I am getting so much better at being honest with myself and better at not beating the shit out of myself for not being perfect. It's fucking difficult, but I'm doing it. I've got some things I need to say to some people but haven't, but it's not too late. I've got plenty of things I could be doing better on, and I'm not nearly as ""good"" as I would like to be, but the fact that I'm trying at all and overcoming even the slightest bit feels so fucking amazing! It brings home the idea ""Perception is reality"". You can change the way you percieve reality and make it even better, and motivate yourself. <lj-cut> I've spent so much time wallowing in guilt for not being perfect and it made me feel so worthless I had no energy to do anything good. Now I certainly don't think I'm now immune to it, but if I keep practicing all this good shit and just working toward my goals I think I can keep this ball of positive energy going and significantly lessen the frequency of feeling worthless and defeating myself before I've even started. I just keep saying these things to myself ""I'm not where I want to be but I am definitely going in the right direction"", ""If you've come this far you can keep on going"", ""People like me didn't come into this life to have it easy, we came to learn and to test ourselves"", various forms of ""no pain no gain"", ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"", etc. I tell myself I feel stronger every time I take the tiniest step toward my goals and it becomes true. I am stopping myself when I think ""Why isn't my best good enough?!"" and answering with ""If you're best isn't good enough that's too fucking bad because that's all you have, so don't waste time feeling like shit about it. The only way to make it good enough is to keep doing your best so don't stop now"". I still make excuses, because I'm just getting into the habit of noticing that I'm doing it. The most effort goes to simply learning how to pay attention, so my internal negative bullshit doesn't get out of hand.
      However, I'm also trying to be as realistic as possible and this seems to be even harder than general motivation, because sometimes the feeling good factor makes me believe what I want to believe, which is easy when I'm just getting back into feeling happy and healthy, not depressed. It's easy to go to the opposite extreme and get myself in ""trouble"". But at least I'm not so busy feeling like shit that I don't have room for anyone else's perspective. I feel like I can take criticism better, because I feel so much better about myself I won't be crushed if someone tells me I'm doing something stupid or hurtful. I used to wish I could see what they meant, but I was so ""wounded"" that all I could feel was pain, not any of the good intentions or honesty and it didn't help me or anyone else. It also inhibits honesty. Nice people don't want to feel like they are crushing someone's spirit, so they sometimes just won't tell them what needs to be said.
   We are all strong. We are all ""warriors"". We can take all the bullshit that comes our way. By we, I mean myself and everyone I care about. None of my friends are weak people.
       I believe that a lot of my positive energy is coming from the fact that it is summer. The sunlight factor. I think I have OCD and I'm not bipolar, but I have felt a bit manic before, and I know that I can become manic at least slightly. I can control it to some extent too, I've found. So, if I can ride the wave instead of being tossed in the air by it, this should work in positive ways. If I'm not careful I could ride too high become out of touch with reality because I'm basically high on ""natural"" drugs and then crash very hard. I think the fact that I am taking this into account and being aware will help prevent it. I will fortify my castle and prepare for the bitter winter that is certain to come again. I'm sick of running away. If you see me trying to run away, let me know. Be blunt if needed. I want to hear the good with the bad, if I can't handle it at the time I'll learn to handle it soon after and deal with it. I want to fucking live my life, not just exist. </lj-cut>
  I've also been thinking about how much of an idealist <i>and</i> a skeptic I am. I'm doing my damndest to keep them in balance. I don't ever want to stop being an idealist or a skeptic. Neither are good without the other, if you ask me. I've seen both extremes and they are both unhealthy and they both blind people if taken too far. That is my opinion, feel free to argue."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I think I post about things, but I didn't. Did I mention that I'm not moving back to Bellingham, at least not anytime soon, and instead I'm finding a place with Mandi in Seattle? 'Cause that's the plan and has been for about a month or so I think. The only reason I'm not sure if I posted about is because a few people have said ""You just need to make a decision and stick to it"" after I already did and have been sticking to it. Moving back to Bellingham, staying in Seattle, it's all scary in some ways. There's no way around it. I simply want to be in two places at once and that's not possible and it came down to feeling that Seattle is where I need to be right now in this phase of my personal growth on so many levels. Even though part of me says ""Go back home. Return to the Shire, like Frodo"", there is much journeying ahead of me before I can do that. I'm also pretending I'm ""studying abroad"". It's easier to not run away and hide from life that way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different topic, next time I'm in Bellingham I want to go skinny dipping in Lake Padden at night. I want lots of company. Who's with me? I don't know when it will be, but possibly sometime next week or weekend, or maybe the next one. My days off are random, and unless I ask for the weekend off I won't have it, except maybe a Friday. Such feelings of deja vu right now.

"event","I don't know what to say. I feel like there is too much in my brain right now, and yet not enough. I no longer feel the ""high"" that I was on all ""weekend"" in Bellingham, and basically since the 4th. I hope it's not reality that I'm coming back down to, yet I hope some of it is. Part of me has been a little out of touch with reality. Some of it crashed in my head a little. Another part of me has gotten more in touch with the ""realities"" and connections I've sorely missed.

<lj-cut>
      I'm just kind of left not quite knowing what to do with any of it. And the few people I've asked for advice just seem frustrated with all of my ""situations that I don't know what to do with"", or like they can't relate to it, or I don't know. Or they tell me things that don't seem to apply <i>at all</i>, and then I get really confused where it came from. Oh well. 

     Even though I feel like I don't know what to say I felt the need to write about not knowing what to say or think. I've had some quotes in my head such as ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"", not that I feel like I'm dying or like anything will kill me. I've just been a wee bit reckless as of late, so that saying applies in odd ways, which I find a little amusing. Also the words ""let go"" and the words to the song ""Let Go"" by Frou Frou (now known as Imogen Heap. I've posted them before. I'll post them again soon. In a different post.

     I've been trying to reassess my whole fucking life again! Trying to figure out which of all my people and places can and can't fit in to various aspects of my life and where they can and can't fit in. If you think that statement is confusing try living in my head, though I don't really reccommend it. I know everyone goes through this shit, and I'm not exactly feeling sorry for myself or anything, but it's still difficult and I'm still a rather indecisive <i>and</i> impulsive person. I'm still not sure how that works. I think often times it doesn't, though it leaves some doors open, closes other doors before they had a chance to open, and occasionally fucks everything up. I'm not entirely sure which is going on, but I'm working on it, and I pretty much think I'm on my own, which is good in some ways, because I think that having not been on my own in too many ways is part of my problem, but not pleasant at all in others.
    I may be flailing, but I am learning to fly. When I falter, I become unsure if I'm flying or just flapping my wings like a retarded bird doing a dance. Sometimes I think I am a retarded bird doing a dance. LOL! I hate having my mercury in Gemini by the way I can think of both sides of almost anything and then I will and they get into fights, and they try to come up with a way to both or all of it at once, and I still have trouble figuring out why it won't work, or at least accepting that it doesn't work that way. In my mind everything is negotiable. I'm training myself to be more realistic, but it's like an addiction to not be, and it's hard to remember why I need to be when my head is all up in the clouds. It's fucking pretty up there! 
       I should stop typing now. I don't believe there is now any way of arguing that basically all I'm doing now is babbling.

     I feel a little sad in some ways. A lot of them are either hard to explain or I don't feel like it (even though I do). I feel a negativity threatening to pull me down. It's fear itself, really. I try to tell myself, ""This is a test, just like the rest of them. You can beat it."" sometimes the way I ""beat"" the tests is simply by wrapping myself in a force field of being unrealistic and then later going ""Oh shit. What did I just do!"" That's not what I was trying to do! Then I go a little bit to the opposite extreme and get stuck taking in so-called reality a little too deeply and in ways that either don't help or make it worse. Lather, rinse, repeat. The hardest part is trying to deal with my personal ""issues"" that permeate ""everything"" without getting overwhelmed or without saying ""fuck it"" and ""falling off the wagon"" again. As long as I don't give into the Bog of Negativity or the manic high of mindless happiness/fun I think I'll be okay. The concept of there even being a ""manic high of mindless happiness/fun"" is in many ways a foreign concept to me. This ought to be interesting.
I feel like Peter Pan ""Fuck growing up! That's for boring people!"", but so is not doing it, eventually, depending on how you do it or not. I also feel like snow globe that just got shaken up, it's kinda fun, but then you realize you're not sure which way is up, and eventually you actually do want to stand on the ground and get your bearings (barings? tee hee. I want some of those too).</lj-cut>

If anyone read all that I will be surprised and impressed. If anyone has any feedback I'll be surprised and even more surprised if it's specific. Am I actually as confusing and ""all over the place"" as I feel like I am? Just curious.

If you can't tell, it is beyond my bedtime and I've sort of forgotten why I really started posting in the first place. Now it's my subconscious's turn to try and sort some of this shit out.

""Every walk goes one step at a time."" or something. Also something about eating an elephant one bite at at time. I think you get it. I miss eloquence. It left me much too long ago. I guess I need to read more. I just finished ""Anansi Boys"" by Neil Gaiman. So good!"

And the consequences of the rather foolish thing I did seem to be nonexistent. So, I think I frickin win! Interesting and exciting times were very much had. Alcohol and stuff was often involved. Also very little sleep, or food for that matter. So worth it! Speaking of food, Lloyd made barbecued kangaroo ribs. Yes, kangaroo. It was good, though too fatty and tasted kinda like beef to me. Lloyd seemed to think that a blasphemous thing to say. Oh well. Interesting.

It wasn't perfect, but I am fine with that. Perfection is overrated anyway (not my cousin Perfection. She is awesome).

I'm going to go eat food and continue to giggle at myself and my wild and crazy adventures. Don't worry though. I try pretty hard to stay out of any actual trouble when I'm ""bad"".

I'm pretty sure I couldn't have done anything else. I chilled with the Caity last night. It was good. The night before I went to a very late party at Chris Hope's house, which wasn't really over until about 6:30 AM when a room mate got a little pissed that it was still going. At which point I realized I felt amused and silly to find that I was too drunk to drive anywhere, and it was fully daytime by that point. So, I crashed there. 

Then I chilled with my Caity all day and night. We watched Project 
Runway. I love that show way too much. It makes me want to get off my ass and get organized and make awesome clothes. I know I couldn't handle ""mainstream"" fashion design as a profession though. I realized this while watching the show.

Now I go to chill with Morgaine and hopefully a few other people on my list. I will probably be at the Betty Show tonight. I will probably have to go home at some point tonight. I would like to wait until tomorrow. I wish I didn't have to bloody work tomorrow. I could use a good long weekend here. I love my

"event","I almost forgot to mention. I ""met"" Salma Hayek the day before yesterday (I talked to her anyway). At my work. She's friends with JZ Knight (the owner of JZ Rose, and kinda a celebrity herself) and she decided to come visit for a bit and shop at the store. We knew this in advance and spent the few days beforehand cleaning the crap out of the store and running around like chickens with our heads cut off...at least the managers did. I ran around busy, but sane and calm. I was a little excited maybe. <lj-cut>
    So, I showed up and JZ and Salma seemed to be the only people in the store when I got there at 1:30. We didn't close the store or do any extra security as far as I could tell. I gave JZ a thank you card because she sent me flowers, and wine and chocolate for my birthday, which was the best gifts from an employer I've ever had by far (and possibly the only ones). She hugged me and called me ""sweet angel"", etc. as usual.
    Salma wandered through where I was soon after, and I didn't know if there was special etiquette with celebrity customers so I just kinda went about my business and dusted stuff semi-near her, trying to get a good look at her without rudely gawking. If I wasn't on the clock I think I would have busted out with ""I loved you in Dogma! And Across The Universe"". Just the thought amused me. I was sent to the store at one point to get her a 6 pack of coca cola. They were leaving by the time I came back. Oh well. Still kind of amusing. I found out later it might have been for JZ, not Salma, but whatever. 
    They came back after eating lunch to shop more and to pick up the crap ton of stuff Salma Hayek bought. Which was when the extent of my interaction with her happened. When they came back I was talking to two young male customers and Salma walked past us. The boys didn't notice. I asked them if they knew who she was. One of them said yes, and I said ""Oh, well she just walked past you."" At which point he was in disbelief, and I calmly said, ""No, it's true. It's her. Friends with the owner"". 
     When Salma Hayek came near the counter, about to leave, I said ""hi"" to her and I asked her how she was doing, to which she gave a typical ""I'm fine. Thank you."" Then paid for her stuff, then saw some things she apparently hadn't seen before, since she said ""Oh I didn't see these before"". I pointed out a few hidden items in the section as well. Then Ms. Hayek and Ms. Knight exited the building, and only half a soda was actually consumed. The end.
     It made my day very interesting. Also, my observations: she is TINY. I figured she would be, but I mean, like 5 ft tall, possibly 4'11. I know I'm tall and I was wearing heels, but still, normally I don't notice when I have to look down at someone, even in heels, and I certainly did. She also kept very much to herself and pretty much ignored anyone who she didn't need to talk to, or if it would have been rude not to. She wasn't rude at all, but I was hoping she might be a little more outgoing and friendly. Oh well. Also, I wouldn't have realized it was her if I had not known. Seeing someone on screen or in pictures is quite different, apparently. She wasn't all made up, she looked rather normal. Pretty, but her hotness didn't hit me like it has when I've seen her on screen (which hasn't been much really). This isn't a judgment by the way, just interesting. It was all very interesting. To me at least.

I actually wasn't that drunk. I was even sober much of the night. Not that it mattered, I had few if any inhibitions and the ones I did have were probably for the best (unfortunately!), even though a few were occasionally rather frustrating.

Most people ended up with drawn on mustaches including me. I was even wearing a doll-esque dress with pigtails and a curly drawn on mustache and rainbow sticker for eyebrows! It was HOT! :P...or something. I was amused.

At one point pretty much everyone stripped down to boxers or undies, and it was quite interesting in the good way. No one seemed uncomfortable in the least, despite the fact that most of the people were straight men (mostly), although I think Caity started it (I think). Ha! I love my best friend.

The party ended with Me, Matt, Sam, Jess, and Zach. Which was a good mix. We all went for a long walk in which I felt like a pimp. Then we got crappy food from the Shell Station and talked and watched crazy Brad Neely internet cartoons and then we all crashed.

It was good times! I want to hang out with all of the people again soon! Some will be at Alan's BBQ this Friday, including me! Fuck yeah! I didn't even have to ask for the day off, I just had it! I also have Thursday off, not that this concerns most of you, but I'm just saying I'm available for hanging out time both days!"

My actual birthday, yesterday wasn't very eventful and I couldn't stay up late since I had to work early today, but it was still pretty damn good. I didn't have to do a damn thing all day, so I mostly didn't. I played on the internet, simply because I could, because I got my computer all hooked up.

After Matt got off work me, him and Terry went for a walk on the trails through Mercer Slough and we ate sandwiches. Then I got eaten ALIVE by mosquitoes and my allergies were being kinda bitchy. It was still lovely though, somehow.  Matt got impatient and sulky during the walk and I was in go mode (partly to avoid mosquitoes) and I got all sensitive and pissed about it, and told him. Then he got all sweet and told me I didn't have to do anything to prepare for the party and he would take care of it. So that was nice. We watched The Tudors and ate nectarines, kettle chips and Blue Moon's Honey Moon ale.

Afterwards it got a little interesting, in the good way and in the not so good way. Maybe I'll get into it later. My body can be very annoying, inconvenient and occasionally disappointing at times. That's all I will say.

Directions:  Take the Dearborn St. exit from I-5 Southbound (probably N. bound too). Take a Left off the exit, which will put you on Dearborn. Take a Right onto Rainier Ave. which is about 2 blocks down (the 2nd light). Then Left onto Charles St. which will be your first left immediately past the Shell station. The building is the first one on the left just past the Shell station and right before the round-a-bout thingy. Matt's apartment is the one on the first floor closest to the road (Charles St. side). There is an entrance on that side. There should be plenty of street parking, though you may have to go down Hiawatha a bit (which is where the roundabout thingy is). It's a secured building so you will need to call me or Matt to be let in (360)305-8853 is my #.

Again costumes and/or mustaches are optional, but would amuse me greatly. However you can make it up to me by doing an amusing dance or something.

Also, bringing booze/beer at least for yourself is a good idea, although some will be provided (mostly Pabst, which was really hard to bring myself to actually purchase). There will be pie and maybe cake and other random snacky things.

Feel free to bring good music or games as well."

"event","I was in Bellingham the past two days. Sorry to the many people I didn't hang out with and to the many calls I missed. It was crazy busy as usual, and was mostly focused on Yoshi and Willow's wedding, which was so lovely. I wish I had pictures. I forgot my phone has a camera in it and I didn't see the disposable cameras that were provided (until it was over).

 I also went to the Roller Betties bout yesterday. The last one of the season! It was great! I didn't think I'd be able to go, but I did. Then I got quick food (Pel Meni)and went out to Rumors for the official after party. I ""shouldn't"" have, but I did and it was a lot of fun, even if I did feel like I was mostly present on a surface level, which was odd. I just couldn't get some of the walls down that would have allowed me to really connect with people. I tried, but part of it was there were too many awesome people that I wanted to connect with, but mainly it was that I couldn't get my fucking shell open enough to really let people in or ""seek them out"". Hard to explain, but I hope you know what I mean. Still, I did manage some good connection and lots of fun, some drinking, but not too much (perfect). Some dancing, which I really fucking needed! It was great. I got about 4 hours of sleep and now I'm at work.

So far today is good. I am exhausted, however, the day at work started with my favorite manager playing ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"". Fuck yes. Now ""Past the Mission"" by Tori Amos is playing. That's the one with Trent Reznor doing back up vocals, not that you'd be able to tell if you didn't know, but still. It makes me happy. The main store managers that play crappy music are gone all day! Also, I'm posting on LJ at work. Yay. I better stop now though and actually work."

I wish someone could just give me an answer that would make everything clear! But I'm not sure it's possible.

"event","Went to my brother David's graduation at UW yesterday, which lasted nearly 6 bloody hours! It started out chilly and not so sunny, but then it got nice and warm and very sunny and I was not prepared so now I haz lobster arms!...and they hurt. Quincy Jones was one of the speakers and I didn't know who he was before, even though I've heard/read his name many times. His speech lasted a long time and it made me cry a lot because that man is fucking awesome and full of wisdom and good quotes and inspiration and it hurt in the good way, like when someone pokes you in the soul and makes it feel better! So I spent half of his speech writing thigns down and crying tears of...um...I don't know. Good things. Mostly.

Also the Japanese students that went to UW right before the U.S. started doing that nazi bull-shit internment thing, got recognized and given honorary degrees since they didn't get to finish, having been put in camps and all that. So, that was awesome. My dad didn't seem to think it was, simply because it made the ceremony take even longer, and ""We already apologized ages ago! Come on! And it too,"" So, he's fired yet again. I had to explain to him that although I'm into history I didn't even know about the Japanese internment camps until about my junior or senior year of high school, so apparently it needs to be brought up every now and then, not to mention that ""apolizing"" doesn't cut it to say the least! I could go on, but I won't.

Other than my dad suddenly turning racist at dinner after the graduation the day was good. I watched the ceremony with my grandma and Anna, David's girlfriend and I'm glad I did. I'm glad I went and I'm proud of David. He has a B of A&S with Distinction and he majored in Economics. Werd.

After dinner, I kidnapped the Joel and we went to Matt's party, where I had about 3 G&T's, probably talked too much. Had fun, then fell asleep, at which point Joel, Matt and one of Matt's Tim's all went on a walk, which was apparently awesome. Now I'm in my PJ's with Joel and I'm going to attempt to shower without making my sunburnt arms hurt too much and then probably go to Pike's Market and get food.

Going to Dinner this evening with My Dad and his parents for Father's day at Ivar's. Should be good."

I'm off work, and I feel like I want to go out somewhere mellow for a drink or something, but I have this annoying fear of going out by myself when I'm not in Bellingham (where I will usually run into people I know anyhow). Also, part of me wants to curl up under blankets and read or write in my journal, but as soon as I get ""home"" I will likely have Terry blabbing to me about medical transcription and lecturing me about being responsible if I try to stop her. She's such a frickin' mother. It's generally good for me, but sometimes I just want a night off.

My brother Joel is in town. I want to hang out with him, but where I'm staying isn't  my place and I work until 10:30 every night this week and he's only in town this week. Where does one hang out with their 17-year-old brother after 11PM in this area? If I had my own place I would have him stay with me and we would hang around my place and watch movies and/or play video games, but I don't have my own place. Even if Terry said it was fine I probably wouldn't be comfortable. Hmmm...Suggestions?

Speaking of suggestions where should I celebrate my birthday?!! It's at the end of the month. If comfortable I would like to invite work people and My Peoples, most of whom are hopefully reading this and will give me suggestions. I thought about asking Matt if I could have a party in his apartment. It's perfect for it. It's a big frickin' huge room basically. A band could even perform in there with plenty of space (and has). I'm just not sure if My Peoples (that means you) would be comfortable with that and would actually show up (assuming of course that Matt would be). If he was 21 I can think of quite a few places to go (and not even necessarily drink).

Anyone in the Seattle area, give me a call if you want to hang out after 11PM any time before Friday. I can't guarantee I'll have time, but I seem to have time tonight (so far) that I didn't think  I would have and this could continue for the next few days, or not, depending on ""brother time"" situation, which is so far totally disorganized and kinda awkward."

I got there late, because I went to a birthday party for my co-workers, who are twins. That was fun and interesting. The Merc was good as well. I need to become an actual member. Can anyone tell me how ""sponsoring"" works exactly? Anyway, I stayed until closing. I kept thinking about leaving earlier, but then I kept thinking ""No, not yet"" as if I was waiting for something to happen. I'm sure I was, but I'm not entirely sure what it was. Maybe it's like what happens when I go shopping when I'm not on a strict schedule, I think that if I just look at ""one more thing"" it might be the perfect thing, or in this case ""If I wait another 15 minutes something incredible and unexpected will happen, or my night will somehow feel more complete with those extra 15 minutes"". Many times it's true, for my nights out (and shopping too for that matter), so I'll likely keep doing it. Even though nothing that I would call ""incredibly exciting"" happened, but my night did feel complete and I was content. I had good conversations and I didn't go to bed until after 5AM, even though I had to wake up at 9. I was fully aware of what I was doing and it felt great. I danced last night too. Dancing combined with socializing = an emotionally revitalized Me. Fuck yeah. 
     When it comes to dancing I haven't been doing it as often as I would like, nor have I been working out, and for the past few months I keep finding it difficult to find ""my rhythm"", or any really. Then I would get all self-conscious (or ""subconscious even"") It's very frustrating, but dancing alone for a while helped a lot. I found it!

I would go into more detail, but I must go actually eat, during my lunch break at work. 

One last thing, I have a picture of my boss at work after closing, in whit afro wig full of rhinestones, that used to be Cher's. When we got to the party and he was asked why he was dancing in Cher's wig his answer was an enthusiastic ""Because I'm a homosexual!"" Best answer evar!"

There had been an open-house in the whole building in which all the artists opened their apartments to show their art to the public and to the grant granter people or something. So I went to the party at this nice dude Oscar's apartment. There were about 6 people at that point, all but one girl of the 6 were also at Matt's house-warming a few months ago, when I got totally trashed. The doors were open and drinking was happening and I partook of the R&R shots as soon as they got busted out...and I had at least 6 of them <lj-cut> in less than 2 hours without that much food in my stomach (I was smart enough to eat a snack first at least).  We were at Oscar's for about an hour and we all had some good, interesting conversations, including one in which me and a very goofy not attractive guy (who is also awesome and hilarious) named John (aka ""beardo""), and I tried to give Oscar advice on how to pick up American women, since he moved here not that long ago from Mexico (and because he asked). That didn't work out very well, because I certainly don't represent ""American women"" in very many ways, especially when it comes to what a guy could do impress me, and neither do most of my friends. I tried though and it was very interesting and it kind of hurt my brain at how difficult it was, because for me it totally depends on the guy and also many things I find amusing, interesting, or impressive many women would find horribly offensive and vice versa then he wanted to go to bed so we moved the small party to Matt's place. I don't remember a lot of what happened once we got to Matt's house, except that it was fun, then very blurry up until I started throwing up. Then I took a bath and tried to sleep in the tub (which worked, kind of and it was too small to easily drown in, though I'm pretty sure I wasn't bad enough to do that anyway). </lj-cut> Eventually I went to bed, at god knows what hour, but going to work at 9AM was out of the question.
    It was sad because I thought whisky was going to be my friend this time. I thought I wouldn't have to miss work either (beforehand). Plus I wasn't mixing alcohols, and I thought I had eaten enough decent food, but I guess maybe it was the consumption of so much in such a short span of time, with probably not enough food or water, and maybe whisky just doesn't really like me, despite my large percentage of British Isles heritage, including Irish.

Matt started getting sick at about 7AM and we both kinda slept until about 1PM, off and on.
     Then we went to the Hurricane and had breakfast...at 3PM. Then we went back to Matt's place and kinda laid around some more and tried to download the newest Battlestar episode, which failed, so we tried to download The Tudors. It took too long for the time we had, since I told Terry I would come home and work on MT stuff that evening. So, I came home and ate dinner and talked to Mandi (yay!) briefly. Then I did in fact do some work.

This next week will be very busy, since Joel is coming to town on Sunday night and I have to work all week and hang out with the Joel, and hopefully David too, as much as possible. Then next weekend will be busy because so many people will be in town for David's graduation. So, you probably won't see me post again for a while."

Hey ladies, if you haven't gotten your HPV vaccine DO IT NOW (assuming you don't already have <i>all</i> 6 of those particular strains and I doubt any of you have <i>all</i> if any of them). I would tell my dudes to do it too, but there isn't yet a vaccine available for males, but it is being worked on, so guys, keep your eyes and ears open.

All Planned Parenthood clinics have it available and Merck will generally pay for most of it if you apply for their thingy. It costs me $30 for each shot. I think I've already posted this after my first shot, but so far I only know of one of my friends that's done it and she's the one that told me how it works, so make your damn appointments already! And if you don't plan on doing it then feel free to submit your lame excuses here so I can argue with them. 

...Because I don't want one more goddamn friend of mine to catch an STD that <i>could have been prevented</i>, or at least the risk significantly reduced, simply by being <i>reasonably</i> careful! I know that there is no fool proof way to prevent STD's but most of the people I know that have caught an STD (that I know of) have caught them because they simply weren't bloody well being careful. Also, if you didn't know, and I hope you all do by now, many HPV strains don't have any fucking symptoms and guys pretty much can't get checked, unless there is a visible outbreak. Also the non-symptomatic ones are the ones that cause cervical cancer.

So, all you hot sexy lady friends of mine, get your vaccine already!  

Because I care about your naughty bits! ...also because I'm against the needless spreading of disease, but whatever."

Last night I saw Dethklok with Cajun. It was totally fucking BRUTAL!!! I also ran into San and couple of her(?) friends that I recognized but didn't know.  I had SO much fun at that show! Cajun was good awesome company, not to mention a good human shield from any moshers that occasionally came smashing/hurtling in my direction. I was full of so much energy after the show, too bad it was a Tuesday. I was half tempted to go out drinking by myself anyway, since I didn't have to work the next day. Instead I went to Matt's house and found something else to do with said energy.


Today I got my second dose of the HPV vaccine more on that in a seperate post. Then I went shopping at Goodwill to try to find a desk for the computer that Matt frickin' gave me! As in for free, because he's nice and knows I need one for  the job I'm trying to learn, and he happened to have an extra new dell with a flat screen monitor lying around from when they handed them out to all new tennants in his apartment. Happy early birthday to me! I may have found a desk, but it was too big to fit in my car and I think I'll hold out for something a little more portable. I did however find %100 washable wool long-john bottoms, a red/black plaid %100 pendleton wool robe, and a sexy stretch denim dress that looked too good on me to pass up. It fits a lot like my black ""zipper dress"" and it's comfy. I'm not yet sure if I can get away with wearing it to work. Unfortunately the long-johns are too small, but they were only $3 and too full of SCAdian value to pass up. Some SCAdian <i>will</i> want them as much as I did <i>and</i> be able to fit in them. Since the robe had a rip in the sleeve elbow, I only had to pay $3 for it too. I could fix it fairly easily or I could turn it into a lovely overdress or tunic for the SCA. Although even though I know plaid is technically period (or so I've read in a few reputable sources) it often looks a bit wrong to me as garb, so we'll see. I'm not sure if I could or would want to pull it off as garb for myself. The fabric is gorgeous though and <i>very</i> good quality (despite the rip), so it <i>will</i> be used.

That's about all that's new for me lately. Or that's all I have time for right now."

Next time, however, I will plan my time to the last minute detail and will not promise to hang out with anyone other than whoever I end up staying with (and maybe like the two people I missed this last time)...as painfully difficult as that will be. It's the only way I'll be able to get my ass back up there permanently. Unless I can make the medical transcription thing work full time. In which case I will need a decent computer and computer accessories. Anyways. That is all for now. 

So many things I'd like to post, so little time I'm allowed to ""waste"" while at work."

"event","Just so you all know, I will be at the Mercury tonight for Ross and Rory's b-day thingy. Yay!  I may need someone to get me in, but probably not, since I invited a co-worker who is a member, as long as that works out. 

 I don't work all weekend!

My plans tomorrow consist of going to the West African festival with my room mate and probably Matt and whoever else wants to go with me! I don't know when exactly this is happening, but food will be involved. Oh yes. Now that I got paid and I will be able to justify at least some fun money (for sanity reasons, of course). 

I don't know what I'm doing Sunday, but Sunday night I think I'm going to watch a noise band play at some Vegetarian restaurant in Seattle around 8pm. It's Matt's friend Tim's band (his other friend Tim, who is awesome. They will probably epic. 

In other news I watched Tetsuo: The Iron Man the other day with Matt and his friend Tim. Oh my god! So creepy and awesome! I love that movie now. See it. See it!...or see it again if you already have. I totally want to dress as the girlfriend in the creepy dream sequence with the metal tentacle penis. I promise not to butt rape you though. After we watched the movie all 3 of us made an oil painting together at 2 AM. It was sweeeeeeet!"

"event","In other news my immune system is still being a bitch and giving me cold after cold and making me tired. My room mate is still being nice and loading me with veggies and supplements...but I think she's starting to feel less generous and more obligated, which she's not. When I tell her not to do things for me she gets all like ""Oh yeah, well then can you afford it yourself?! No. That's what I thought, so here you go and shut up about it."" It's kinda funny and confusing. I'm not always sure when she's just joking. 

And the job search is still going slow, because I don't know what I'm doing and I could do with a lot more focus. I'm trying to fix so many things all at once. I also found out that if I want to get on a debt management program I need something like $490 a month <lj-cut>(which includes my credit card bill, at least), which doesn't include the $100 a month that I'm still paying to my old boss at Curves. With the budget we figured out that means that I would need to make about $1900 dollars a month and in order to do that I would have to be making the same amount I am now ($12), working full time, plus a second job at least one day a week. This also means that I couldn't go to school until this was finished (no time) which would take around 3 years, so I'd be 28. If I don't do something, the motherfuckers (aka debt collectors) will come after me and garnish my wages eventually and that will be much worse I'm sure. So, I don't know what the fuck to do, and I'm freaking out a little, which I don't have time for, nor do I have time for this post even, but I have to get this out! 
       Not going to school for another 3 years because I fucked up my finances feels like a prison sentence. My chances of making more money will have to wait and that feels very counterproductve.  On the bright side I live in the US, and in some other countries they could give me an actual prison sentence or worse for screwing up my credit and medical bills like this. If I don't do this the fucking creditors can and will come after me at some point, and I doubt they will have a problem garnishing my wages, not to mention they will have tacked on more interest regardless. The credit counseling people said it would take me an average of 28 years to get out of debt if I tried to do it on my own (I'm not entirely sure they figured that) and an extra $5000 of interest over that span of time. They can eliminate or significantly reduce the interest on my debts and the fuckers can't come after me even if they want to. The credit counseling place is a non profit organization, so I don't see what reason they would have to give me untrue or misleading info.
      I'm so sick of postponing my life just to keep my head barely above water financially! To keep the dogs at bay. 
      I'm almost 25 and I've done jack shit with my life. I don't have a career, and I don't know what I want to do, other than get my ass back in school stat! And now I have to postpone that yet again and hope I can get and keep work that will pay me well enough to continue to keep the rabid dogs at bay...and hopefully it will be a job that won't make me want to jump off a cliff and I'm supposed to find said job in Bellingham! This is so fucking ridiculous! I don't know what to do. With my current state of rent and other bills I can barely afford to come and visit Bellingham once or twice a month and every place I job search wants me to come in in person before they will even consider an interview. Then I have to schedule the interview when I don't work and and when I can afford to drive up there, and when it works for the interviewer, when my job won't tell me my schedule until Sunday before the next week.

Please tell me I'm being overly pessimistic and everything isn't nearly as bad as it seems and I'm just being a pansy or something. Can you do that honestly?! I can't. I'm freaking out, and if I don't stop posting this I won't have time to shower or make a lunch and/or I'll be late for work, hungry and dirty!

     On the plus side my room mate is sort of trying to teach me medical transcription which is what she does for a living. If she can teach me, and I can buy a computer and all of the equipment with my imaginary extra money or something then I could make more money and do it on the side. This could be good...if I could make the time to fucking do it with everything else I'm trying to do to keep my head above the god damn water. 

If you read all that congratulations and thanks for bearing with me, instead of thinking ""I'll come back when she's less fucked up"". That could be a while. </lj-cut>"

I also washed my face in the dew (er rain, whatever) of the fresh spring flowers. Then performed what I will term for simplicity's sake as ""prayers""...of the natury, pagany variety.  I wouldn't say I got to celebrate like I wanted to. That would have involved a more private natury area, and other people...bonfires would help. It would have helped even more if it wasn't a work day. I'm at work.

I'm debating opening that bottle of Mead for the occasion, but I should probably save it for an SCA event, where I will likely feel the emptiness of lacking mead more sharply, even if it is Beltaine. 


That's about all I have to report here. By the way I'm feeling much more sane than I was during my last <i>really</i> long post. I still feel depressed, but not  dramatic, frustrated or bitter... at all really. At least for now. My reaction later, upon reflection of some of it was sorta like ""Shit, did I really type that out loud? Can I say I was drunk? Well maybe no one will really notice that part...right. No seriously.""

""And if you're very, very lucky, there are a very few blazing hot little pains you feel when you realize that you are standing in a moment of utter perfection, an instant of triumph, or happiness, or mirth which at the same time cannot possibly last - and yet will remain with you for life.""

It's not always up to me. I'm not willing to fight for what is only potential without more fuel for the fire, even if I want to. I hate pining for things I can't have. It would probably end with me feeling confused and angry and bitter anyway. I already am a little, passion is only useful when the intended target is an option. Yet it won't go away, because I'm such a hopeless romantic idealist and only one other person has poked me in the passion in this way before. Seriously one. So fucked up. And I wish people wouldn't open up to me so much right before running away. Yes, despite how vague I'm being this does help somewhat. Somewhat.

"event","Today is one of my days off. The other one is tomorrow. So far I've spent it reading and typing away on LJ and eating some food...in Matt's apartment, by myself, in a robe. I slept here. It was good. I was going to leave when I woke up, but then I remembered there is internet that doesn't have an hour and a half limit and I can be alone here until at least 6PM if I want to. I'm considering being a hermit all day. I don't really know what to say right now. I don't know what's relevant these days...and I have a new appreciation for things being somewhat relevant since my internet/writing time is so rare and rushed these days. There's too many goddamned things I want to say. There's too many emotions I've been feeling. In the last few weeks I've been feeling completely and utterly exhausted emotionally, which has very much spilled over into the physical, as it tends to do...thuse making me tired and resulting in that damn cold I had three weeks ago still hanging on, which I could deal with if I was happier and less exhausted. But I'm not. Good things have happened too, but I've had much less energy for them and I haven't felt them nearly as much as I want and need to. There's too much internal crap in the way. The pipes are clogged and I can't find the tools or the time to clean them, nor do I know where to start.

      I got to go to Mandi's birthday thingy, for The Merc part of it and after! I used my last $5 in the world (until next paycheck)to go. Because I'd be damned if was going to save my last $5 to miss Mandi's birthday party and stay home angry and depressed about it because I might need that $5 for something more depressing and inane like parking or lunch. Fuck that noise motherfucker! I have my limits

<lj-cut> Lucky for me Terry is a motherly and very bossy Virgo, who insists on feeding me on her own dime rather than letting me pospone my phone bill or car insurance (even if it won't fuck me over to do so) to buy groceries or eat out instead. For example, if I tell here I'm going somewhere, she'll ask me what and/or where I will be eating and if I tell her I will be spending money she'll either load me up with a packed lunch, make 10 suggestions of things from her fridge that I could take instead or she'll say ""Don't be stupid and spend money you don't have, just come back here and eat"". Point being I won't starve, and she's insistent enough and occcasionally insulting enough that I don't feel too bad letting her feed me...except the fact that I actually need it. I hate needing help. It makes me feel like my mom!</lj-cut>

It will be okay financially...as long as I can stay reasonably sane that long. The only reason I'm broke now is because of that week that I only worked 2 days that week and my regular schedule in 4 days a week instead of 5, but I made up for the lost time last week and will do so this week.

In other news I feel utterly trapped (which I have mentioned before) because I need to make too much goddamn money to simply survive and slowly dig my way of this ginormous debt hole. I'll find a way to make said money in Bellingham, but it is not proving easy in the least, and most of my personal energy reserves are quite lacking and it's getting to me, and I'm finally finding the effort to stay sane and not go into self-destructive breakdown mode very difficult. Plus in my mind I have time limit and it's a lot of pressure. Knowing that things will be okay is one thing, actually feeling that way and acting that way, in the midst of a whirlwind of chaotic change is quite another story. Oh my gods is it ever. Trying to not feel isolated and alone and push everyone away is also a challenge, and a stupid one. It makes me very angry that I ever feel that way. But sometimes I do. <lj-cut> I've just been trying to ""keep it together"" and ""get my shit together"", which unfortunately means I don't have as much time or energy for the things that keep me sane, such as seeing my people and more importantly really truly connecting with them. I'm getting so fucking sick of my own problems that it makes me want to literally vomit at times. After coming to the realization that I've been pushing people away somewhat or keeping them at arms length out of fear and trying to shield them from my emotional chaos I finally got some of it out. Last night at Matt's house after watching Battlestar Galactica. He knew I wasn't okay, and I finally realized it and I realized that I had reached my breaking point. I had three choices angry lashing out, trapped animal style, or literally running away and not coming back (I only do that with people I don't know well and/or don't trust), or bawling my fucking eyes out and attempting to honestly explain why. Well, the damn broke and out came the sobbing and crying. I knew that letting it out in tht way would be the most sane and least destructive way to go, plus Matt was both letting me and encouraging me (both nice and smart of him). I sobbed about how it's hard to change so much all at once, and how I don't have the energy to do as much as I both want and need to do in the time I want and need to do it in, and how I'm sick of my own problems and not being able to help other people like I want and need to, and how it all just got overwhelming.  He was being very helpful and sympathetic and didn't try to give me advice (also smart). I didn't get it <i>all</i> out, but a lot of it. I didn't realize how much crap was in there and I'm glad I'm not nearly as repressed as I could be, because emotions are very much like water. The longer you wait for the damn to break or spill over the more damaging and devastating it will be. </lj-cut>

Despite everything I've just typed I know I'll be okay, even if I don't feel like about half the time right now. I have awesome people who won't feel so far away for much longer if I can just get my ass back home...and all the negative feelings have indeed had many breaks of positive ones in between that do involve real connection with my peoples. I've just been feeling out of sorts in new ways that I'm not accustomed to, and old ways that I thought were dead and buried, only to have them return like rotting zombies.

In other news I had a dream that Caity and Torrin (aka Jesse) were getting married...at Denny's. Somehow. Even though they were both still with their signifigant others. In this dream I was trying to be supportive while also plotting ways to stop it because I knew it was wrong and would end in divorce, probably within a very short amount of time. It was horrible, and funny (kind of) when I woke up, because it was so ridiculous. They were going to have a ""pearl wedding"" , which in the dream meant that there would be mini celebrations at Denny's every week for two months, rather than an actual traditional ceremony. There was also some shit about a snow warning. And I felt horridly powerless to stop them, despite such a horrible sense of doom and ""wrong"" because they were so happy. I don't know what it is with my friends getting married in my dreams and me feeling the need to stop them, but not knowing how is about, but this is the second one in the last few weeks, though very different from the first. Maybe that's what happend when I sleep for 11 hours or so my subconscious starts smoking crack in my sleep.

Also, I'm still reading ""Better than Sex"" by Hunter S. Thompson a lot. I'm nearly done, but not quite. I still love it and I'm going to have to read more of his stuff very soon. Maybe Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I think I should stay away from reading about politics in the past, it's too eerily similar to the present and I happen to care, but not enough to take a ton of action, so then I just feel like the country is doomed, because I'm part of the problem, but still not willing to take the next step other than voting and maybe sharing words. 

Also Jade_Kadir posted this from a book, and it came from a section about pain and it was oddly and painfully relevant. I've been in one or two situations this could apply to ""lately"". Reading this made me go ""ow"" and gave me happy tingly goosebumps and ""poked"" me so I had to share.

In other words I have to make decent wages and I have to find a job before I can quit my current one. However that is exactly my plan. I'm just feeling helpless and pessimistic, even though I know I'm not. Not to mention I don't have my shit together in the time management department. I've considered just saying screw it, and quitting my job and getting my ass up to B'ham.

I can't explain it. It's like being ""home"". I was a very, very good girl. So good, it kinda creeped me out and hurt my brain a little. It was a full moon, at an SCA event and I managed to hardly drink and didn't get any even remotely ""naughty"" action of any type. As in not even kissing. Mostly. One kiss in broad daylight on Sunday hardly counts as ""naughty"", in my book especially when this was <i>after</i> having him as a bedwarmer all weekend. I wasn't even trying that hard to be so good, but whatever. It was probably good for my sanity...maybe.

In other news I still haven't found a job and I'm broker than dirt, so I can't even leave town until who knows when. Job searching and going to Reina's housewarming/purple party next weekend is going to take magical miracles. On the upside I'm finally going to a debt counselor . I walked in yesterday and filled out preliminary paperwork. I'm not entirely sure how they will be able to help me, but hopefully I'll find out next Tuesday during my appointment with them. They are non profit, so yay.

In other news I still think boys are dumb. Maybe the weather will clear in that department, but I'm not feeling terribly optimistic and I won't go into too much detail even though I would really like to. Stupid complicated communication BS.

"event","So, for most of the week I've been sick, with a cold or sinus infection or some crap. It sucked and I stayed ""home"" in Bellevue at Terry's, even on my days off. And I went to Caity's birthday party on Friday, even though I still felt kinda crappy, because it was my Caity's birthday party. Duh. I brought Matt with me. It was good. I've been hanging out with him quite a bit lately. Caity's party frickin' rocked my muthfuckin' socks off! So much so, that I woke up completely cured of my cold! Seriously. I still felt crappy physically last night at the party, and my ears were totally plugged. But the people's and the party was so awesome that no cold could bring me down, even though I drank a little and got like 5 hours of sleep...yet I woke up symptom free. Figure that one out. Awesome, no? I was sad that I had to leave so ""early"" because I had to work in Bellevue at 9am, but I definitely got plenty of fuh time in. I didn't need alcohol to lose my inhibitions at that party either. It was definitely a party worthy of the Caity.
      So, then Saturday I worked until 6 and then I went to Matt's housewarming party and Tim and Geoff's band, Incogneato, played. Yes in Matt's apartment, because it's frickin' huge! Tim is one of Matt's best friends and I played D & D with Matt, Tim and Geoff (and other awesome people) every week for a few months. Anyway their band is awesome despite being very pop punk because it's pretty much tongue-in-cheek humor based. They do a ""hardcore"" instrumental cover of ""Rock Lobster"" and Tim wrote a song about his love of Fergie.
   The party was awesome. Lots of neighbors showed up, because they were invited and lots of other awesome people of the Matt as well. I danced and ate yummy pasta cooked by the Matt and met a humorous dude with a huge beard who told me I should call him ""beardo"" I also danced very badly with him as well. His manner of socializing remind me a lot of Jess Manley. I also did drink at this party and totally blacked out and passed out and then woke up and threw up every half hour from 8am until about 2pm...or tried to. There wasn't much in my tummy. Not fun. Needless to say I didn't go to work at 10:30am, or at all. I slept until about 3:30 then Matt and I got food at Pike's Pub. So good! Then we looked at shops for a bit, then we came back to Matt's place and watched Princess Mononoke, which I had never seen. So frickin' good! Now I am being fed pot stickers as I type this, by the Matt. Yay. I win...except I'm still exhausted from the first half of the day. Thankfully I was told that I didn't do anything stupid last night, but I flipped lots of people off ""all in good fun though"" apparently. PSA: gin and tonics followed by white russians followed by shots of sambuca is a HORRIBLE idea! I should have known better. It was probably the sambuca that killed me.
    In other news I'm broke as hell, managing to go to Sir Eddie's may take a miracle, but I'm determined to do it somehow. So none of you will see me until then, and only if you go to the event."

"event","I'm back in Bellevue. I'm exhausted. I'm full of all sorts of emotions, a few of which are negative feelings/situations that have not been resolved. Most of it is internal, I suppose. I feel good for the most part though. I feel alive. No more time to explain."

"event","Haven't updated in a while. I wish I had a laptop so bad. I wish I had the money to buy one. Anyways, I've been all over the place emotionally lately. I don't feel as screwed up as I did earlier yesterday. After work I went to Rachel and Steve's and we had pizza and beer and watched ""Stardust"", which I just bought along with ""Across the Universe"" for $20 total (Hollywood Video)!

In other news I'm coming up to Bellingham Tue-Thu this week. I'm rather broke though, sadly. In other news I think I have a job in Bellingham at Nostalgia Vintage wear. It's very part time, and it doesn't start until some undisclosed time at the end of April, but I'm looking forward to it. I can't quit my current job yet. Wendy, the owner said her store is affiliated with a coffee shop that is going in next door and her friend owns it. She mentioned something about me maybe working there as a barista, but I wasn't totally clear. I guess I need to call her and get some clarification. She said she would call me closer to the end of April about scheduling and such. She mostly wants me to work Fridays and Saturdays, but the store closes at 6pm, and opens at 11 so it won't too much weekend time. Anyways, tis a good thing if a little confusing.

Matt wants to talk to me, so I'm going to his place after work. I think it will go well, but I'm dreading it a little because I know it won't be painless and I don't know what he wants to talk about, nor do I really know what to say to him about anything, except that I miss him (as a good friend) and care about him and it hurts to not be able to talk to him and hang out whenever I want. This is the longest I've spent without at least talking to him in over 2 years, and the space is definitely felt. I've felt a mixture of relief and empty loss. Anyway, I guess we'll see how tonight. I have no bloody clue what to expect.

That's all for now. Back to work for a few hours!"

"event","I'm stuck in a holding pattern right now in my life, and it's terrible. I had an interview last week for a child and family therapist job not in a school, and now I'm waiting to hear if I get a second interview. (the first one was on the phone.)&nbsp;I&nbsp;had a training all last weekend to learn how to be an animal assisted therapist so that Patronus can come and do therapy with me at work and now I'm waiting to hear when his evaluation will be so that I can stress about something else and work my ass off to train him. And I'm waiting to be able to do something that I don't really feel like I can talk about yet....

the problem is not just all the waiting, it's the worry that none of these things will pan out. that i won't get the second interview. that patronus won't pass his evaluation, or worse that he'll be deemed not acceptable (if he growls at all or shows any kind of aggression...he's not so good with the hugs, but we can work on that...)&nbsp; and if the other thing doesn't happen...ugh. I don't even want to think about that. 

so many good things happened all right around the same time...i wasn't even supposed to be able to go to this training this month, I was going to have to wait until March because the wait list for the pet partners training is miles long. but i squeaked in. I had the phone interview the day after I found out about the training and the other thing, well...that's been in the works for a while, hopefully. 

i guess all i can do is cross my fingers and hope for the best. it just sucks to wait."

"event","the cruise was amazing. the fact that a large group of us were there for harry potter fandom related events was even better! the first night on the boat we go to sit down to dinner and who's sitting across from us? Brad from Draco and the Malfoys! (Brian was around too, somewhere, but not at our table.)&nbsp;I did a little *squeee!* dance inside before playing it totally cool for almost the whole week. yeah, he sat with us every night. it was AWESOME. <br /><br />bands that played: <br />Draco and the Malfoys <br />Remus and the Lupins <br />Dreary Inferi <br />House of Black (we missed this show, it was at 11:00pm and we both fell asleep. oops). <br />Witherwings <br />The Bezoar Project <br />Diagon Alley <br /><br />....there may have been others but I'm blanking now on who they were. oh yeah, there was a Twilight concert too, but as I've never read the books.... <br />We also had events like a costume contest, Harry Potter Bingo (it was called Winky), witch and wizard newlywed game (with couples like Remus/Tonks, Hagrid/Olympe...) we didn't go to that one though, I don't remember why. Philip and I carved a Harry Potter Pumpkin...the whole trip was absolutely amazing. AND on the last night, we're wrocking out to Remus and the Lupins and BRIAN from Draco and the Malfoys is dancing right next to me!!!! I was such a little fan girl!

"event","I saw RENT&nbsp;tonight. The one that they had filmed live on Broadway, before the show officially closed (hopefully not forever. Yes, there's still the tour, but it's not exactly the same as experiencing it in the Nederlander.) anyway, it was AMAZING. it was everything that Chris Columbus's film should have been but wasn't. The raw emotion made me fall in love with RENT all over again, although I've never really fallen out of love with it in the first place. This Mark was really good, a close second to my all time favorite Mark, which of course is Anthony Rapp's. Speaking of which, the original cast (all of them) came out at the very end for another rendition of Seasons of Love. If I didn't cry hard enough at the death of Angel, this made up for it. I was ecstatic to see all those faces again, I just couldn't stop crying. My beloved RENT will no longer play at the Ned, but it will always have a home in my heart. 

Thank you, again, Jonathan Larson."

I think part of what I'm excited about is that they're&nbsp;playing in an actual theatre...rather than the&nbsp;basement of the Denver Public Library. Now, don't get me wrong, I've seen them there twice and loved every second of it, but at least this time they'll be on an&nbsp;ACTUAL stage and when really mean tall people stand in front of me it shouldn't matter too much.

I suddenly have an urge to reread them all again... as this time last year I was rereading them all along with other crazy folks on this here LJ, all in preparation for the 7th book. Maybe I'll read them all again in time for the 6th movie? &nbsp;"

so, we've moved. Phil and I are on our own, just the two of us, with the&nbsp;amazing Patronus. (and the cat.) It has been fantastic. I was really concerned, somewhere, in the back of my mind, so not&nbsp;REALLY that things would turn suddenly bad, or that living with the variety of people I have lived with has fulfilled my&nbsp;need to&nbsp;have drama in my life, but now living with just Phil, would I need something&nbsp;to complain about? Not yet, and I don't realistcally forseeing it happen. I don''t know how Phil and I ended up together, but we did and things continue to be great, every day. My heart still flip fliops when I hear his key in the door, and soon he switches to the day shift which means we will&nbsp;have a real,&nbsp;grown-up life together, rather than seeing&nbsp;each other for 20 minutes a day (except on weds and thurs. and sat and sun. then it's a couple hours.) i'm really excited to be able to come &nbsp;home to him, to have dinner with him, and to have date nights again.&nbsp;
and in other news, Patronus is almost a Certified Canine Good Citizen, as he graduates from his advanced dog class in a couple weeks. I am so excited, because once he gets certified he can come to work with me and be a therapy dog, with his magical healing powers and great big ears ready for listening."

on a side note, you really never know how bad something is until you realize how good it can be. Phil and I went and bought our tree today (a real one, my first real one in YEARS) and it was so much fun. we had fun decorating and he humored me by letting me listen to NSYNC christmas. He's just so amazing. I know I say that a lot but it's a new thing for me, to have someone that really truly cares about me, someone I can be myself around, someone who's perfect. for me.

In all my relationships I've wanted to push people away when they got too close, or I've been too clingy or too needy or too whatever, but it's not like that with Phil. I don't want to push him away. I like thinking of the happy ever after and I think he, no, i KNOW he is my happy ever after. and it's a little scary. It took me soooo long to think that Justin was my forever, and even then I wasn't so sure (see my numerous break ups with him.) but with Phil I am sure, and it's new for me so it's scary. but it's awesome. we went and saw Spamalot with his parents yesterday and he was all dressed up in his suit and I kept thinking about how good he would look in a tux. Cheese, I know, but I can't help it. I am SO IN LOVE!!!"

"event","So I had this dream last night and it was so weird I had to write it down.

Justin and I are upstairs and we hear a weird banging noise and go downstairs and there's tons of people coming in, setting stuff up on the table for what looks to be a party. I ask them what the hell they think they're doing in my house and one guy tells me to ""chill, baby."" Justin says nothing, just watches them come in. More and more cars pull in, somehow all these cars are fitting in our two parking spaces. More and more people come in to the house, piling in the living room. They start to look around, at all the electronics and computers we have, murmuring to one another. Justin and I head back upstairs, after I talk to the guy who told me to chill and I ask him to please not touch anything, just have their party and be gone. We come down later and the laptop is stripped. by stripped i mean i open it and there is nothing on the inside, just the case that holds the laptop components. I freak out. Justin says, ""well at least they left the mac."" Switch to some weird building. I'm in there with a bunch of nameless, faceless people. We're having a party. The people from the party at my house keep showing up, wanting to get in. I keep blocking the door, telling them to get the fuck out, after what they did to my house, to my computer. The ""chill, baby"" guy comes back. I see him more clearly now. He's really cute with short, black spiky hair, nice smile. He tells me he needs to go to the store and asks if I will go with him. I agree. We end up at Market Basket. He leaves me there, and comes back to get me after I spend some time wandering the asiles, looking at nothing. Back to the party in the weird building. I tell everyone to not talk to him, that this guy is manipulative, tell them about him leaving me at the store. More people try to get in. Chill guy comes back. I yell at him. Tell him he's a ""Logan Huntsberger wannabe, who acts like a prick to make up for the fact that he's got the smallest penis in the world."" I don't know why I'm saying these things, and he laughs at me. It makes me furious. I start to hit him but my hands feel really small and I don't hurt him at all. He continues to laugh. 

I woke up with his laughing still ringing in my ears."

"event","I miss Alaska. After reading a friend's online journal I realized how much I missed that place. The smells. The sights. The people. The Mountain. The incredible hikes to anywhere in the backcountry. The amazing talks with Peter where we shared so much about ourselves in a friendship that started almost the second he walked into the village. The nights at the bar, and even more, the nights behind the front desk, watching movies and eating sweet potato fries. A summer spent away from Justin, discovering more of who I was and what I wanted. The summer that made me realize I no longer wanted to be in Wilderness Therapy. The 14 mile, one day hike. The blisters. The tears. Playing Cranium with Peter's family. Feeling like I was a part of something. The car rides with Josh to get his license, and the car rides back when he still couldn't get it. The rides to fairbanks in the back of a truck, and even more conversations with Peter. He said something to me in an email the other day, about how Alaska was a place where both of us held back very little. And he is right. I held back very little from him, and he from me. We talked about our significant others, our plans for the future, our hopes, our fears, our dream to one day climb The Mountain. I was more open with him than I have ever been with anyone except Justin. And it all came on the tail of not being able to talk to Aaron ever again. One door opens while another closes, right? Isn't that how the saying goes? So why now? Why am I remebering my amazing summer in Alaska now? Three years later? I don't know. I guess because even when I am happy somewhere, I always want to be somewhere else. I want to be in New England now. Near Boston. I want to be able to see the leaves change. Or be in Alaska, watching the Northern Lights flicker across the night sky, while the chill of fall hangs in the air and around me. I want to not be at this job that makes me feel like I'm not doing anything. I want to feel like I'm making a difference somewhere, and I want to be making that difference somewhere besides Colorado. Of course, when the first significant snowfall hits the mountains, and when ski season is just around the corner I won't want to be anywhere else than my Rocky Mountain Home. Because the snow on the Rocky Mountains is one of the most beautiful sights to see, but for now, I want to be somewhere else."

"event","holy crap i haven't updated this thing in forever, but since things are actually happening for me again it seems like a perfect time. hmmm. let's see. i have finally graduated from Naropa. (yay me) I have finished my amazing internship at MDS counseling which was so incredible and such a life-changing experience. it seems really strange to say but i really felt like i changed so much as a person through that time. i'm way more comfortable talking to people now, and much more confident in my abilities as a therapist, which i am sure will come in quite handy at my new job. yes, that's right, i have a job as a children's advocate at the denver safehouse (a shelter for domestic violence survivors). as an adovocate i won't be going to court or anything (which is what a lot of advocates do) but i will be doing a lot of 1-1 counseling with the kiddos and the mothers that are staying at shelter. I've only been there for 5 days and it is so overwhelming and insane and it's really going to test my abilities to set boundaries, as well as my ability to take care of myself and not take all the client's stories home, which again, i kinda learned how to do at my internship. but yeah. it's crazy. i'm excited about it though because its the first time that i have a job doing what i want to be doing. i'm not in retail anymore, i'm not twiriling signs on the side of the road or doing any of the other insane things i did through grad school to try and pay my bills. I'll actually have money for once, and will be able to save, and won't be living paycheck to paycheck (that will be soooo nice) and i'll have health insurance, something i don't think i've had since, oh, AmeriCorps? 

in other news, i am rereading all of the Harry Potters, well except for the 1st one, I just didn't want to read it. i love getting lost in the world of Potter, and it makes me want to talk in a british accent all the time. I'm already back on the 4th one, after just picking up the 2nd one a few days ago. i think it will help me to read some good books that i can get lost in when i come home from a long day of hearing crisis calls and dealing with mothers who can't deal with their children. 

holy crap this is a long post, and Harry is staring at me from the cover of his book, beckoning me back to him to pick up where I left off (he's going to meet Sirius in Hogsmeade). Which reminds me. HOLY SHIT! I had forgotten how much the movies strayed from parts of the books, ESPECIALLY this one. I mean, okay, it's a huge-ass novel and all, but come on! Neville doesn't give Harry the gillyweed, Dobby does! And where's Ludo Bagman? And Crouch? Crouch isn't in the book like he is in the movie. And Rita Skeeter isn't portrayed half as nasty as she really is. Okay, sorry. I still love the movies, but my gosh! /rant."

"event","it's been fucking forever since i've updated this. why does it seem like once things start to go well for me everything comes tumbling down? For example: I've quit the Home Depot. My last day is tomorrow and I'm actually taking steps to take care of myself, reduce stress and be happier overall. My master's thesis is due in 12 days and I'm feeling ready for it. The blocks started falling the other day, however, when i found out that my transmission is going and that my car probably doesn't have much longer to live. great time to not have any more money coming in, right? right. now i found out that my sweet mother will be giving me her car for graduation (along with whatever payments still need to be made on it, but oh well) so my car just has to make it till may. okay. a few blocks fall, a couple go back up. then today i get a check in the mail from my car insurance place. ""sweet!"" i think. then i read it: for cancellation of policy. ""i'm sorry, what? why the fuck was my insurance cancelled? and why wasn't i notified?"" i think back to a letter i got a few days ago that sits unopened on my dresser. it's from said car insurance agency, stating that as of March 27th I no longer have insurance due to, and I quote:

""driver's license has been under suspension or revocation.""

ummm. WHAT THE FUCK? my driver's license was suspended or revoked? well, that's fucking news to me! and of course, of course, the people I need to talk to are only there mon-fri. so i'm fucked there. then i flip through the 4 pages which all seem to say the same thing when i get to a page from some consumer reporting place, which apparently sent this bullshit info to the insurance place. it states on the bottom that my motor vehicle report has been sent to the insurance agency. there is NOTHING that i am aware of that would be negative on my motor vehicle report. i've been in one accident, which wasn't my fault, had one speeding ticket which the cop changed to a warning and gotten one parking ticket. the only thing that was recent was the parking ticket, and, please, correct me if i'm wrong, but last i checked they didn't suspend your license for one parking ticket. 

so basically, i'm going to be driving around without insurance for the next couple days till all this gets straightened out and i'm going to freak and stress out about it all cuz that's what i like to do. i guess."

I just found out that my first draft of my masters thesis is due in a month. I don't have a second reader, I don't have my group started yet and I some how need to come up with 35 pages out of my asshole. It's a good thing I can write fiction fairly well cuz it looks like that's what this paper is going to be. Problem is I won't even have any real life experiences to base it on, other than my own thoughts about what I think it should look like. and it's too late now to change my topic, since all the research is done for this one and my lit review is done and everything. 

fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. 

i have a meeting in 20 minutes to talk about what this semester of the masters thesis is supposed to be like and i'm SURE the teach is going to ask how our research is coming and i'll have to lie through my teeth and say ""it's going really well. the group got off to a slow start with trying to get permission slips back and such so i won't have as much to go off of in terms of case studies, but otherwise, it's going well."" HA. slow start? hi, try never got off the ground, at least not yet. 

keep your fingers crossed that when i get to school tomorrow there's a stack of permission slips waiting for me. or even one permission slip."

"event","i am so sick and tired of the elementary school i'm at for my internship. i hate having two different spaces that i'm supposed to try and set up as my counseling space, especially since one of the rooms is the frikkin conference room, in the office area, full of office shit, with people coming and going as they please. nothing can be kept confidential in that space, so what do i have to do if i need to go to the bathroom? put everything away, all the files and stuff and try and put them in a place where someone wouldn't go snooping while i'm gone. the art room is a different hassle, especially since when i'm there on tuesdays the art teacher is also there and ALL my stuff is in her room in a cabinet, so i have to make sure that i get there early enough to get whatever i need, drag it all up a flight of stairs (i take about 4 trips back and forth) and then i can't get back in there until her classes are done, which means that if i didn't grab all the files i have to wait and sit in the conference room and twiddle my thumbs. 

i understand that they are short on space, that this year there are 9 new staff people and that it's a small school. i'm very understanding of it all. they, however, don't seem to be as understanding of my needs, possibly because i'm not expressing them forcefully enough, possibly because they are too busy and cramped and this really is all that will work. but that's the thing. it. doesn't. WORK! i had a little 1st grader the other day, and i wanted to set up space on the floor for us to make a mess and play with blocks and whatever and i couldn't because of all the shit in that room. 

and then today i met with a parent and i didn't want to meet in the conference room because, well, i hate it in there, so we met in the PTA area and this frikkin parent is going off about all these other kids, not talking about her own and when she DOES talk about her own she's all like ""i just don't want stuff to bother her. she gets upset about the littlest, petty things."" hi. she's in 5th grade. a friend not sitting with her at lunch is not petty. it IS the end of the world for her, for that day or that week or that month. i think the parents are going to be harder to deal with than the kids 99.9% of the time. 

i envisioned this great space when i met with the intern from last year, who, by the way, had her own office. i envisioned lots of plants, and wilderness-y posters on the wall, and colorful rugs and big comfy pillows and lots of toys all spread out in the office so that kids could grab whatever caught their eye and we could chill and talk and work thru stuff for a half hour. maybe that's my problem. maybe i should have thought that the place would be shitty and then this would be great in comparision."

"event","i feel like i should be doing something slightly more productive with the next 45 minutes before my 4:00 client shows up but i just can't get myself to. i've updated all my files and like a genius i didn't bring a book with me to read cuz i didn't think i'd need to for whatever reason so now...here i am. 

i wish there was more for me to update about, like my clients and stuff but it feels like somehow i'd be breaking confidentiality should one of them happen to be on here at some point and see this (i don't know how) plus, eh.

what i can say is that i like it. i really do. it's amazing to be doing something that i WANT to be doing for once. to not dread coming in. not that everything is all sunshine and daisys everyday, there are times when my clients annoy the piss out of me but that's when i know that i'm working too hard and they're not working hard enough. it's also an amazing feeling to have a question for a client, to be curious, to really want to know something, not just because you feel it's what you should say but because you're really, genuinely 100% curious, ya know? it's really quite wild.

justin should be getting his new Mac soon. it's like christmas for him. he's sooo excited and i'm excited for him because it means it'll be one less thing he'll have to worry about. and it'll mean that much more work that he's able to get done on the million and a half film scripts he's got floatin around in his head. i'm really proud of him this year, and excited for him too. he's working his butt off, hasn't skipped a class yet (a feat in itself, believe me) and is excited about the work that he's finally able to do. course, he found out that he probably won't graduate in the spring since there's a bunch of elective classes that he never knew he had to take, but whatever. that's a whole other story. it just means i'll have to be the sugar momma that much sooner. :D

it's f'ing freezing in here."

"event","it smells like fall out a little. i love it. i love that the leaves are juust starting to change so that you notice it only if you're looking. i do so miss the fall in new england, but the perfect blue sky and the yellow leaves of colorado will have to do for now. i took the most amazing walk today at the park that's not right out my front door but it's pretty damn close and it was so peaceful and there's a brook that runs through it and there were a bunch of leaves to crunch through on the ground and ahh...it was perfect. 

i have an urge to go do one of those corn maze things, but justin is so anti-them for some reason (i don't know, so don't ask) and i don't think i could drag him to one unless i threw a temper-tantrum.

"event","i had to go to traffic court today because when i got in my accident a few weeks back i didn't have proof of insurance with me so...i had to go to court. i was scared shitless all day too, thinking that they would fine me like a bazillion dollars and send me to jail, but once my name was FINALLY called i was in and out of there in a flash, no fine, no nothing. yay for me.

last night i had the craziest wacked out dreams. these are them. (1)justin saw the rough cut of the RENT movie and told me to stop being so excited about it because it sucks and when i tried to tell him that it was the rough cut, he told me it still sucked. (2)the intern coordinator at MDS came up to me and told me that she had been looking through my files at my case notes on my clients and proceeded to tell me that i was not doing nearly enough with them, that i was not where i should be at this stage of the game and that i should seriously reconsider what i wanted to do. (3) something about tom...being nice...saying he missed me...having very little hair. :D...

speaking of tom, i sent him an email. and i know i shouldn't but i still hope that when i go to check my email he will have responded. what's sad is that i KNOW that he doesn't write back the next day like i try to do, and that he may not write back at all, but still...i hope. and i feel like all i'm doing is setting myself up for sadness. 

also, i miss aaron lately like whoa. and i have this feeling that him and i will never speak again as all of my emails to him have gone unanswered. i really fucking hate when people i have been friends with forever get married and then don't talk to me anymore. it happens more often with guys than with girls, mostly because they marry these rediculously jealous women who don't let their husbands talk to old female friends. really it's quite annoying. and if it happens with peter i really will have to hunt him down and kill him. so jenny, please, let him talk to me!

enough of my ranting. i need to same some stuff for gestalt class tomorrow."

You are nurturing, kind, and lucky.
Like mother nature, you want to help everyone.
You are good at keeping secrets and tend to be secretive.

A seeker of harmony, you are a natural peacemaker.
You are good natured and people enjoy your company.
You put people at ease and make them feel at home with you.</font></td></tr></table>

"event","everytime i come on here i think that i have something to write about and i'm sure that i do but i just dont want to sit down and type. i'd rather watch the newest RENT trailer a thousand times. yeah.

my roomate is driving me bonkers. i have officially diagnosed her as being narcisstic, and its true what they say about labeling, it just makes it worse. you would think that since i've labeled her as such i can understand her rediculous behaviors, but no. now each new stupid thing she does she's just living up to the label. take for example the fact that she didn't come to justin's birthday party. was it somewhere far far away that she didn't want to drive to? no. was it on a weekday or a day where she had to work the next day? no. it was AT OUR APARTMENT. ON A SATURDAY NIGHT. her lame fucking ass exuse: she stayed up too late the night before, had to work until 2 and was thusly too tired to come down. BULLLLLSHHHHHIT!!!! sure she stayed up till 3:30 the night before, and sure she worked until 2. but when i got home from wherever it was i was, she was already home, taking a nap. she didn't go with her bf to the broncos game so that she could nap. then at 9:45 when people started showing up, she closed her door all the way, turned off her light, and went to bed. i was fucking livid. mostly because for my birthday she acted in the same manner. only that time we went out and we didn't do what i wanted to do because she was toooooo tiiiiired and had to get up sooooo early the next morning. now, had we gone to dave and buster's which is what SHE and her fucking narcisstic self wanted to do, i'm sure she would have wanted to stay out way later than 10:00. 10:00!!!!!! fuckin a. she's constantly annoying me. CONSTANTLY. i know that at somepoint this semester i will snap on her. and then justin will, or justin will and then i will because we're both soooo stressed out and she's all complaining how hard it is to work full time and take 2 classes. oh waaaaaaaaaah.

i think what i have to try and tell myself is that i will have plenty of clients like her and if she were a client and not a ""friend"" how would i treat her differently? the biggest problem with that though, is that most likely i won't be living with a client, nor will i see them on a daily basis. 

i've also had this strange urge lately to write to tc. i won't. but the urge is there."

"event","i seriously need to stop obessing about the RENT movie. it doesn't even come out for another 3 months and still i can't stop thinking about it. it seemed to fade a little while i didn't have internet, mostly because i couldn't get on the RENTblog site and see what new posts and videos had gone up, i couldn't check the RENT community on here and see what people were saying but now...well now it's back to how it was and now I'm watching the international trailers and waiting up till 4AM to watch access hollywood to see the next trailer (ok, i'm not, but i'll be checking the RENTblog everyday for them to post it. or apple.com...) seriously, it's sad. 

if you want to join in the obsession with me, and if you've seen RENT (JULIE!) or even heard of it, you should...go check out http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/rent and see what all the fuss is about. 

i also can't wait for the next HP movie, but there's not nearly as much hype out yet, and i'm sick of the teaser trailer...even though i could watch the RENT trailer 15 times a day."

"event","that's supposed to be the wedding march. i just found out my friend peter is engaged! it happened last night apparently. i'm so excited for him, and yet somehow there's this feeling of sadness sitting somwhere in my tummy, thinking, ""why can't that happen to me??"" (obviously not with peter!) in honor of his happiness i have changed my icon. :D

i talked to the principal from McKinley Thatcher, the school I'm doing the other part of my internship at
and it seems the room last year's therapist used has become the speech therapist's room which means that i now have to share rooms-one day i'm in the art room, one day either that room or the social worker/psychologists room. it's not a HUGE deal, it's not like she said ""sorry, we changed our mind and don't want you here"" but the biggest problem is that i can't leave any stuff set up, i can't leave out my sandtray and all the toys for sandplay therapy, i can't have games and puzzles and stuffed animals and other random things around. and i' pretty sure the art teacher isn't going to want me to use her stuff, although being in that room means i CAN make a mess so that's good. she also wasn't very understanding as far as my schedule goes, and what with me having to take 2 extra classes to make up the ones that i would have taken my 2nd year if i wasn't in WT, and the fact that i'm already seeing clients and have limited space at MDS...it was all very frustrating and disheartening. 

i also don't know if i'm going to be able to do my master's thesis on what i wanted to do it on because i don't know if there's really enough information out there, but to me that's all the more reason to do it! so i don't know.

and in other news, i almost lost it with jess last night, she was all freaking out because the cat was sitting on the stairs and she couldn't get her to move (it's a CAT for goodness sake, not like a bear or a tiger or something)so i said ""look, right now the cat knows that she has power over you, that she is in control, not you, and unless you walk by her or smack her when she tries to claw at you, (which by the way, she's not actually trying to claw at her, she just kind of swats the air) she will continue to think she has control!"" and she was like ""but you're stronger than i am! and i'm not going to stick my bare leg at her so she can claw it!"" i don't know what strength has to do with anything here, it's not like we're in a weightlifting competition or soemthing with the cat as the judge...anyway. she's stupid when it comes to the cat, and she won't listen to me so everytime the cat is in the way she'll just call us to move her."

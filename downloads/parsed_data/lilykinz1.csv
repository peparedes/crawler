"event","i think i need to like hit my ""reset"" button.  

before i go back to heavy restricting, i need to shrink my stomach so i won't have SUCH issues with being hungry.

the best way to do this is, 

yep you guessed it! a fast!

I'm going to fast for a week--nothing but coffee, diet coke (because i will NEED the caffeine) and lots and lots and lots of water.  

*and since on Monday i HAVE to have lunch with my friend and she will harrass me if i don't eat, i'll allow myself some fruit and salad with fat free dressing, and that's it.*

and i'm not going to pressure myself about working out, but if it's nice enough i'm going to try to start jogging around the lake, and do some squats etc. to keep toned.

I feel so much better now that i've figured this...i had no idea why it was so hard for me to get back to how i used to be, and now i know that i need to RESET-- esp. since i won't smoke anymore, i have no way to curb my apetite.  I just need to restrict almost completely (ex. monday) until I can get back to being able to take in a little but a little only, with no problems.

I know i can do this, i know it!!!!

How many lbs. do you think I'll lose by next saturday night?  (that will be my re-weigh-in) I'm thinking 6.  

:) can't wait!!"

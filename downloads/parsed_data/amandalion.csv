"event","Life is good. I&nbsp;have no complaints. Except that I am poor. But yesterday I was talking to a woman I&nbsp;just met and she said that in New York, your first years, you merely &quot;survive.&quot; And it's true. I'm fine. Gonna be fine. Minus student loans. I wish those upon no one. Not my biggest enemy. Which, come to think of, I'm not sure who would be.

So things are swell. I love my apartment. My roommates are cool. I love my church. I love Brooklyn. I love the doggie that lives with me. I have a job. I like my friends. I'm going home to see friends and family soon.

I can. not. wait. for Thanksgiving. I haven't been home since a couple of days around July 4, which I&nbsp;guess isn't terribly long ago, but it's long enough. I&nbsp;need to see me some of my peeps!

See ya."

"event","This is the room where we always dreamed
of grass and splendid evenings
emitting frequencies
lost between the leaves and things
and I held on brightly, crushing quietly
feeling mountains rising out of
make-believe seas, creating typhoons
of feelings not easily made without need

God bless that smile on your face
God bless the seeds in the ground
God bless my family's keen gaze
Oh, I know
that whatever happens to you
whatever happens to me
I hope that I'll fall asleep
knowing that you'll always be
the story with no ending"

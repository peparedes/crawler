 My friends have got problems again, and I'm stuck in the middle as the one listening to both of them. I'm being a bad friend as well, because I'm taking sides. Gawd. Anyways, I'm pretty busy now so I'll sign off, I guess. Ciao !!"

I know they suck xD but uhm my Photoshop's currently down and all those (except the Apocripha/0 one) were made using PSP9, which in my opinion isn't as good as PS. I've got some more but right now I've gotta go, so ciao people!! I PROMISE I'll post more in my next entry =]"

I mean - I've got high-speed connection, but for some reason these past few days it's been acting up and being a slow ass. It so pisses me off. I can't even upload my LJ icon! >.> but I'll blame that one on LJ, heh.
 Well uhm, I can't think of anything else to say here, so I guess I'll just stop eh. See ya next time, people! Oh yeah, new icons comin' at ya! As soon as I get them uploaded xD And that'll be in the next post =] So be patient, yea?"

"event","you are my eleven
my hope my wish
my everything
dancing in the snowy
winter of your
own unconciousness
what you do not understand
is the reason for our exsistance
this enigma effects us all
every direction leads to a self invoked dead end
your gwntal kiss
brings happieness
to a world down and broken
to feel your heart beat close to mine
is to know our love will never pine
from first sight
till last
with out a word you show me true love is
us"

"event","The wind cathches your words
They float and trwirl past my ears
Like a beautiful red leaf on a crisp autumn day
Right there I hear those words
The words i cant help but embrace
Those three little words filling my heart
And leaving me with an everlasting image
Forever captured in my soul
And a kiss forever captured on my lips
Once again i hear those words of sweet serenity
For this gift i hold you tight
And you hear the same pleasent sound
From me to you form you to me
An everlasting present for us to share
I Love You"

"event","Hey i got to hang out with crystal monday. it was great i met her at a resturaunt with her friend and some lady i dunno but anyway while we were there i got to hold her hand this probably sounds corney but i've liked her for like ever and i finally was able to show her. After that we stopped at her freinds house and there we kissed the most magnificant moment of my exitstance. Later this week she taol me the she thinks she actually feels something for me ive been waiting since the 5th grade to hear that so it kame as a total shock to me. the only problem is i have a g/f and she has a b/f. what do i do what do i do. I asked Crystal what part of the night she started to feel something for me she said as soon as i sat down and our  eyes met. My g/f constantly pisses me off but i dont know how to break up with a person and i see her constanly so its so grr.... I really really like Crystal shes all i think about i dont know what to do but at least im not alone kause she doesnt either."

"event","why? i dont know i just dont know. Couldn't have been someone else? A lot of things happen 
to other people your not the only one thats this happens to. But why i did everything right? I don't 
know its just one of those things. Couldn't it have been some one else? Of course it couldv'e 
happened to any body. But i don't see why it had to happen to me. It's just one of those things. 
But oh god why? Listen you have to calm down you kant keep doing this your whole life. Calm 
down how the hell am i suppose to calm down when something like this happend how? Just chill 
out. I cant im out of here!
    Sleep is my only sanity for at least three hours out of a day i can get some actual peace. So 
what if its not real this little hole of contentness is the only thing holding me on this planet. Can 
you honestly say that you love your life the way it is can you say you wouldn't want to change a 
single thing about it? This is my life not yours i wake from my uphoric wonderland and sit and 
pitty my self what a world to live in. No sence in going to other worlds because you always wind 
up back here again. I can really say hell is looking fun compared to what i go through now.Why is 
it this way you ask what happened what set this off? 
     Wake up its time for school! The first day of kindergarten. That was a great day no worries 
about anything mom would get me my clothes make my breakfast and ship me off to the bus 
stop. I would goto to school and come home every day. This would be the same routine for the 
whole school year. Wake up time its for school! The first day of first grade. That was a great day 
wake up pick out my clothes mom would make breakfast and ship me to the bus stop. Goto 
school meet new freinds these freinds will be with you for the rest of your life. Come home. Well 
you know the rest but things do get worse trust me. Goto to school walk home from the bus stop 
crying. Same routine over and over. Most children where afraid of the man in the closet i was 
afraid of the people in everyday world. Over exaggerating everything i thought might happen 
nothing logical but a constant fear that what i thought was truth.
     Was it the constant tease that makes me think i am not good enough am i not good enough 
for others or for me. You your not good enough for you. You  tell yourself that your not good 
enough for other people. But i'm not im white trash i can never be with anybody betterthey would 
reject me. No you just fear rejection in almost every form therefore you dont even try. Not trying is 
the worst thing you can do. But they dont want to be with me just look at there faces as i walk 
past. You are just making things worse then they are. You make yourself look like you don't want 
anyone to talk to you. Try smiling once see how far you can get on that. Make them think you are 
happy. So try and be fake so people will like me make it seem like everything is fine. Well it 
won't be fake after you are freinds with them you will be happy          cause you will have what 
you want. Your wrong i got to go. Just remember you cant escape me.
     Summer came. No more waking up early, no more school work, and best of all no more of 
the kids at school. Swimmig runing around all the fun of summer and once again i am content 
with no worries no pressures for anything. Once again i get to enjoy my childhood. Still i slip 
away to a misserable place in my mind were I find my truth and figure out i have no one all the 
freinds i made dont call left here alone. What a harred way to waste a season playing video 
games and staring out the window hoping something might happen.
     You always put pressure on yourself this is why you do some of the things you do. But those 
things make me feel better. Do they or do you just think they make you feel better? They do. 
Your wrong how does it make you feel better its tearing you apart look at it your not supose to 
be like this. What am i suppose to do there is nothing else? Yes there is theres a million 
different ways to deal with this. But now its a need i must have it. You kan stop that you can fix 
this. I have to leave. 
     Time for school! This would be point of no return. Everyone started to split up into their own 
little groups losing and gaining freinds. Now is when  you were one or the other there was no in 
between or if you were it ment you were rejected my all groups and even then you were in a 
group. Every one was labled. What happened to the times when you were freinds with everyone 
now school was a camp for our future where we would be even further labled.
 I cant figure it out i just cant why do i become so attahed to people i barely know? Its just 
something your gunna have to figure out yourself. But i cant I've tried you know ive tried. It will 
kome int time. I cant wait its goint to drive me off the edge look at me im a mess i cant stop 
moving around my heart is racing im paranoid and i cant keep my mind set on one thing. Don't 
worry you will be fine. Fine, who the hell am i suppose to be fine when im like this? Trust me 
everythng  will work out. Your crazy i should kill you right here. You already try to kill me why not 
finish me off maybe you are to afraid is that it? You know what fuck off ok just fuck off i will get rid 
of you! ...to be completed"

Wow. Great. So I'm the girl who will ""go nuts"" and tell him to go to the doctor. Yeah, really great opinion of me.

I think I'm just going to leave one day without telling anyone, and just seriously move the fuck on with my life and stop wasting my time on other people. I can spin it two ways, one being that I'm not a great person to confide in, which is seeming to be the case more and more, or that everyone else is just drifting away and leaving me here.

I like the first one better. Why blame other people? You only have yourself."

1. WE WON THE ISL TOURNAMENT! Who the fuck cares if it's lower division, we still had to play a 5 game match against Madeira. Won the first game, lost the next two, won the fourth, and pulled off a win in the 5th. It was amazing.

2. CARRIE WON TWO CMA'S LAST NIGHT! She was nominated for three, but she only won Female Vocalist and Best Single (for BHC). She looked absolutely stunning, of course. She had the most perfect performance of So Small in this gorgeous yellow dress.

3. I got a 35% on my Chemistry Quiz. Yes, a 35%. That is the lowest grade I have received in my life. But, it's strange; I really couldn't give two shits. I don't know why, but I have this apathetic attitude towards it.

Okay, I don't like listing.

Tomorrow I'm going to the play with Carla. We're just staying after school, then going to Noodles to get dinner, and then coming back to watch the play. It should be amazing; the reviews were awesome, and the preview they showed us in school was brilliant. So I'm looking forward to that.

I went to a ""waste sanitation and treatment plant"" today. I.e., a poo plant. Yes. I saw water with dissolved shit in it. I had to walk around and try not to gag on the disgusting smell. It was kind of...sad. When we got there, there was already like, 10 people standing around waiting for us. I guess they don't get visitors often, because they ushered us all right into this gorgeous conference room, with this amazing power point set up;  we sat in leather chairs and listened to them talk for a few minutes, while this guy ran around snapping pictures, almost like he wanted to prove to people that the plant actually had visitors! It kind of seemed like the highlight of their day."

"event","We finally won our second volleyball match of the season today! It was awesome, we were playing this really bad team, we won in three games, and the score of the second game was 25-8. It was AMAZING.

Except...

In the second game, there was this insane second pass, it was deep in the far back corner, so I swung my arms and got it over, but I twisted my back and really wrenched it. I could barely walk (the play is still going on) and I basically staggered over to the sideline and kept saying ""I need a time out, I need a time out."" We FINALLY win the point and the coaches have to pull the person doing lines to come in for me, so someone from the stands has to go do lines, and then I get checked out by the trainer, and I'm fine within like...a minute. =\ It hurt SO bad though, it felt like someone stabbed a knife in my lower left back. I definitely pulled a muscle, and the trainer said it will hurt like a bitch tomorrow, but today it will be better since my muscles were warmed up and loose.

It was so funny afterwards, I was talking to the coaches, and they were like, ""Yeah, we were freaking out, I was about to tell you to just fall down on the floor and writhe around!"" (because the stupid play kept going, so they couldn't call a time out). I feel silly for making them call a time out though, and then being fine within a minute. =\ The same thing happened to Gwynnie earlier in the season; she pulled the same muscle at Madeira and was fine within a minute.

But we still won! :D"

BUT!

I've already pre-ordered a copy from Amazon, and I'm planning on buying another copy from iTunes.

But oh my god, I am in love with this album. Honestly, this just blows Carrie's debut, Some Hearts, out of the water. It's much more country, with a couple awesome, BHC-like songs like ""Flat On The Floor"" and ""Last Name."" I'm expecting Last Name to be released as a single, and if it isn't, her label is fucking retarded.

And then there's ""Just A Dream."" What a tearjerker; it's about an 18 year old bride whose new husband was killed in the war. Typical country song, but the melody is so haunting, and the lyrics are superb, making it stand out from all the other ""Person x dies in the war"" songs.

But my favorite song is ""Wheel Of The World,"" the last track. It's Carrie's favorite too, and it's where she got the title for the album. I've already learned how to play the intro and first verse on the piano, I worked it out by ear, which I'm pretty proud of.

Everyone needs to buy this album. It's just fucking fantastic."

Phew. It feels good to get that pathetic fact off my chest (even though I'm sure it will come back and bite me in the ass at some point).

Second: My neck, shoulder, and back are really messed up. I don't know what I did to make them get this bad, but I can't move my neck in a certain direction without a searing pain starting at my neck that goes down through my shoulder, and into my back. I remember diving for a ball at the Madeira game and really stressing my back, but I was fine after a few minutes. It's been getting worse the past couple of days, but I've been ignoring it because I know Frost will make me sit out the rest of the season. Plus, I was doing jump serves today, so I really don't think that helped very much. =\ I'm going to just try and wait it out until the end of the season so I can keep playing.

Third: He used the ""brb"" line on me. Everyone knows it, where there is that person you need to get rid of, so you say brb and (of course) never return. It just pisses me off, we used to be closer.

Fourth: My face is really hot, but I feel so cold. Ugh. (Not as important as the others, but still worth mentioning.)

Fifth: I feel...indescribable. Sad, lonely, upset, jealous (no idea why), listless, lackluster, tired, worn out, etc. A mix of emotions that run together until I can't tell what's up anymore.

But to add insult to injury, Dryden was being such a complete bitch; mouthing off to the coaches, displaying a horrible attitude, and exuding negativity, so of course she had a negative attitude on the rest of us. It just sucked all around.

We have one more game to play tomorrow, and hopefully that will be it. I'm sick of my team at the moment; they have no motivation to win whatsoever.

Thank god I have a three day weekend, even though most of it is taken up with volleyball and horses. Tomorrow night is the Brad Paisley concert, which should be awesome. Monday I need to do some horse thing, and then I also need to decide if I want to find a Homecoming dress (if I end up wanting to go to Homecoming, which I probably don't).

Under the circumstances, we did fairly well; we held our own against a very very good team.

Stupid Model scheduled their tournament the same day as the SAT. So we'll be missing TWO captains on Friday and Saturday, and we'll have to get a new libero, and a whole new fucking rotation. This is going to be interesting.

Anyway, this song, ""Undo"" is fantastic. Her voice sounds great on it. It's slow, but powerful.

I just got back from Victoria's party. It was fun, awkward at times since I'm not exactly friends with the rest of the people there, but it was tolerable. I basically just hung out on the couch and watched ""Blades of Glory"" (which I saw the night before when I slept over at her house). I got her summer reading notes which I can copy because I've done jack shit in terms of summer reading, and school officially starts on Wednesday. I feel bad for asking her because she's on Honor Council.

I'm feeling really emo tonight. I think it might be an adrenaline let down from the party. I'm in this mood where I'm listless, tired, depressed, down, etc. I wish that I was the kind of person who could just admit when they're sad. I feel horrible telling someone that I'm anything less than okay because I don't want to burden them, and I don't want them to feel obligated to help me. I'll drop hints, but then if we approach the subject, I'll change it before it can get too in-depth.

These are the times I wish I was in a relationship. That I'd have someone who I could go to and lean my head on their shoulder and ask for reassurance. I feel so alone all of the time, like I can't fully connect with people. I'm lacking the thing that binds people together and solidifies relationships. I'm not lonely on the surface; I have multiple people who I talk to, I have conversations and superficial relationships with people, but underneath....it's like I can't take that step forward and feel comfortable enough to actually open up.

I&nbsp; measure friendships by whether I can tell people the bad things about me. And so far, there is one person (Victoria) who I can vent to. Even with her, though, I don't feel totally comfortable. I have to be coerced and cajoled into saying the difficult things.

I want to be needed just as much as I need someone right now. But there's never anyone there.

I think I've failed in that respect. I harbor a deep appreciation for well-written and elegant prose, but I'm unable to emulate it.

(For anyone who cares or read my last entry, there is finally a different ad to the right: Dragon Fable. I think I just came with excitement.)

I'll adjourn with an intellectual ""peace out."""

I wonder why the rocking horse always shows up on the right side of the screen when I post to my livejournal. It just annoys me.

I keep checking

Yes, he's written back.

I was checking to see if Ryan had written back yet on MSN. I haven't spoken to him in ages, I'm glad he IMed me.

I wish I could IM Tealle. I still think about her tonssssss, less than before, but still quite often. God, she's so fucking attractive.

I've finally gotten better about typing without looking at they keyboard. Though I still make tpos. I ddn't I'm not backspacing so I can see how many tpos I make. I seem to misslpell the wokrd typo a lot. Wow, now I;mr eally fucking up. Okay moin on.

Wow.
Wow.

I'm scared of Kat. Ever since she was a complete bitch to me, I hate her and she's just ughhhhhh.

I would like to talk to Kate more, but she intimidates me. So, I rarely speak to her. Only in irc occasionally, rarely on MSN.

Ryan said chillaxing. Wow. Wowwwww. I keep checking to see if he's typed anything. I've missed his sarcasm, it's a nice change from talking to other people.

I've noticed that I'm hitting enter twice when I come up with a new thought. I guess it's my natural way of keeping order.

Now my thought process has stopped. Hmmm.

Goddamn, I keep going back to that fucking rocking horse. It is so fucking annoying.

I want to get high. Really badly. I keep coming back to this strong strong urge to go buy pot from someone and just let myself go. I had a shitload of energy drinks today, which made me giddy, but I want a better high. I'll have to talk to someone about getting some pot or something.

The phrase ""Good girl"" always seemed demeaning to me. I don't know why. But I just told Evey ""good girl"" and then I felt bad since I've always thought it sounded demeaning. But secretly I'm thrilled when someone tells me that. I'm a strange individual.

I still pronounce ""Evey"" as ""eee-vee"" in my head. And while I was on the phone with her, I accidentally mispronounced her name, and then felt stupid. But I just can't get it stuck in my head that the correct pronunciation is ""Evvv-eee.""

Bridie is worrying me. She's down and acting introverted, which just makes me worried about her. I just want her to be okay.

I've finally gotten myself to automatically use ""okay"" instead of ""ok."" It seems more sophisticated, which I like.

And that's it for now. Weeee."

"event","So, I leave for Volleyball camp at Duke on Thursday. I'm not looking forward to it all that much...I really dislike the people who I'm going with, and I just don't like social situations in general. I'm really freaked out that I will have forgotten everything I know from last season and make a fool of myself. Not to mention that I haven't done anything to prepare for it, at all. So I'm going to be pretty sore in about a day. Ugh.

That's basically it. I'm tired as fuck, and I'm lacking the energy to even just stand up. I'll be walking to a room, and feel like I'm going to pass out. I get extremely weak, my legs get wobbly, and it's not fun. I feel like I could collapse at any second. Maybe going to Duke and getting out of my house for a little while will be good for me.

I need to think of an audition song for American Idol. I have no clue what I'm going to sing.

But anyway, I'm tired, so I'm going to go to bed."

She knows that I refuse to do that. I hate hate hate hate ordering food. I hate it with a fucking passion. All she ever does is fucking tease me about it, and laugh about how stupid I am, and it really is pissing me off so much right now, I can barely type.

She doesn't take me seriously! Yeah, it's only ordering food, but I have like, this morbid fear of it. She just treats it like it's some fucking joke to her, and not something that I seriously get really stressed out about.

I have a horse show tomorrow. Should be good, it's not supposed to be crazy hot like it has the last few times. Plus, it's at Prince William, so there's shade, rather than at James Long where it's just blistering.

I really don't know what to post. =\

Oh. I'm going to go try out for American Idol in August. I probably won't even make it to Randy, Simon, and Paula, but it's worth a shot. It's up in Philly, and MiAnne and Miranda are going too, so we'll either share a hotel room with them, or get a military discount on a room because of them. So either way, it's pretty good.

Work is going okay, I guess. Not much to report there. I wish I worked with people besides old ladies. =\

I've been going in irc quite a bit since Evey showed me the online client thing. It's better than before, at least people now aren't insulting me every two seconds. I still hate Kat, though. But everyone else is pretty much tolerating me.

And yeah, that's pretty much it. =\ I wish I had more to say, but, whatever."

"event","Yay, I got to go with Victoria for the fourth. We were going to go see fireworks at Ft. Belvoir, but when we got there, the guards said that it was ""closed to the public."" Okaaaaaay, so we asked where they might be having them, and one guy said down in Old Town at the harbor. We drive down there and wind our way through Old Town (passing Jack Sike, Andrew, and Kelly Austin on the way, gag), and end up at the harbor. Victoria's dad parks illegally and gets out and starts walking around trying to ""find a place."" Ummm, okay, so we're just there in the car in case someone tows it or something. =\ It was so funny when we saw him like, ambling around; as Vicky put it ""He looks like he's just lost his wife."" So funny. He comes back and claims that we won't get a good viewing spot from where we are (the fireworks are being put on at the National Mall in DC; supposedly they had to evacuate it at one point in the evening because of the threat of severe weather), so we keep driving down along the harbor, out of Old Town. We see all these people who are camped out along the bank, with a ton of people parking along the grass next to the water, so we end up pulling in behind another car. We're just starting to get out of the car when the Park Police come along and inform us that they're going to be ticketing and towing the people illegally parked on the grass. They're basically yelling at us to move, so we keep driving maybe 5 minutes down the road, passing a ton of ""illegally parked cars"" and end up parking on the grass, just further down. In the end, we didn't get ticketed or towed, so that was good.<br /><br />The actual fireworks sucked. Vicky and I spread some blankets on the ground and basically just messed around and took pictures. We were acting sooo strange, hahaha. I need to post a couple of the funnier videos on YouTube. We took ""Prattle Tales"" (the 8th grade literary magazine) with us, and Victoria did a ""dramatic reading"" of some of the poems. Hilarioussss. I needed a new facebook picture, so we took a ton of me, most of which turned out heinous. I borrowed Victoria's Burberry headband, and I had a black polo on, so I definitely looked like such a prep. The only other thing I needed to complete the picture would have been some Vitamin Water.<br /><br />Us being weird:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dovelove16/pic/00002fb1/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dovelove16/pic/00002fb1/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br />And yeah, that was basically my fourth. Other than that, I went to lunch at Greenspring with my Grandma, and tonight she and my family are going to 2941 for her birthday dinner. God that restaurant is fantastic.<br /><br />I'm drinking Vitamin Water. Best. Drink. Ever."

"event","Wow, third post in one day. Go me. Watch this be the last one ever.

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so I internalize things. Tons. Too much, probably, but hey. I feel very very uncomfortable talking about myself to people because A) I think that they'll think I'm an attention whore B) they'll get bored of me so quickly, and C) they'll realize how messed up I am. A combination of all three would suck, but A is the one I worry about the most. Plus, I'm naturally a very private person. I guess I'm pessimistic in the fact that I have this...thing, where if I tell people something, they'll use it to manipulate and hurt me. Which is probably because it's happened before, so it's not completely unfounded.

It's weird; I like being sad/down/depressed because I have no clue how to act when I'm happy. I haven't really been happy since Paloma died, and when I get flashes of happy moments, I go way overboard or get really freaked out because I can't like...contain myself, I guess. I haven't had enough practice, so it's easier for me to stick with the familiar and stay sad/plain/whatever. I like the apathy.

Sooooo as practice for talking more about myself, here are some things about me:

1) I wish so fucking badly that I had an eating disorder. I've tried and tried and tried, but I don't really have the willpower to sustain it and promote it to full fledged ""eating disorder.""

2) I'm a secret attention whore. I want attention so fucking badly, but I do everything in my power to make sure that I don't receive any. Yes, I know I'm strange. I really don't know why I do this. Partly as punishment, I guess. I punish myself for wanting attention by making sure that I fade away in lieu of others.

3) I'm a huge hypocrite. Hugeeeeeeeeeeeee. I tell people things that I know will probably help them if they so choose to follow it, but I never take the advice, mainly because I don't want to get ""better."" If that makes sense.

4) I wanting something horrible to happen to me so I can find out if people would care about me. Like, if I get in a car accident, I wouldn't want to die, but I'd want it to be serious enough so that I could see who would visit me in the hospital.

Andddd I think that's it. Sweet."

"event","In the past week, so many crap things have happened, though none to me, thankfully.

A foal that a friend was looking forward to was born too large, and the colts chest couldn't make it through the birth canal. My friend was by herself when the mare foaled, and she broke blood vessels in her chest and pulled muscles in her arms trying to pull the foal out. The foal was born dead. Thankfully, her husband got home and helped her save the mother. This foal is part of her livelihood, and without it, she's losing thousands of dollars in income, not to mention the heartbreak of losing a foal.

A horse at my barn slipped in the field a couple of nights ago and hurt himself pretty badly. The neighbors called the barn owner at 9 pm, saying that he was acting strangely. The barn manager called Trigger's owner, and she went out to the farm. It took her and the barn owner two full hours to get Trigger in from the field, and the vet thought that he had broken his hip. Luckily, it wasn't a broken hip, just a lot of soft tissue damage. He's still on stall rest for two months.

Another horse at my barn, Ranger, has had an ongoing shoulder problem. He's had two surgeries, and if his shoulder opened up again and abscessed, he would have to be put down as there is nothing the vet can do for him. Well, his shoulder has opened up again, really badly (in part because the fucking owner refuses to take care of his shoulder, and only calls the vet when it gets really bad). So it's not looking too good for Ranger right now.

Then, my friend just told me that her neighbors daughter died in a drunk driving accident. She was the passenger, and the driver was drunk. They crashed, and both ended up going through the windshield. She died, while the driver is in a coma currently. She was only 17.

Then there's Lucy having to have her eye removed, my fight with a friend, and Margarita bucking with me a ton tonight while I was riding.

It's just been a strange week."

"event","Since Bridie has a LiveJournal, I guess I decided to get one as well. *cringes* Lameeeee, but whatever. I'll probably forget about this over the course of the next week. Actually, that's a little ambitious. I'll probably forget it by tomorrow.

Lucy has to get surgery tomorrow to have her eye removed. She has glaucoma, and it's pretty bad so they've scheduled her for an emergency operation at 7am tomorrow. She's been blind in that eye since she was 8 weeks old; when she was a puppy, she got too close to a bone that my older dog was gnawing on, and my old dog bit her. One of her teeth went right through Lucy's eye, blinding her. It's going to take some getting used to to see Lucy without an eye. =(

Andddd that's it, I guess. I'm shit at writing these things. Maybe I'll become more interesting overnight.

PS: Go watch the video for ""Online"" by Brad Paisley. Funniest shit ever.

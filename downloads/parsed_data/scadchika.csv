"event","So, nothing really new here in the SAV.  hehe.  I miss everyone, my classes are boring and this quarter will be easy.  On the other hand...I NEED A SECOND JOB!  My dad is totally going to kill me if I don't get one...
  I have been really down lately...sad...sick...sleepy...I dunno whats wrong...but I am sure it will go away eventually, I hope anyway...
  I am ready for everyone to come visit, maybe that will make me happy.
  I am a boring entry writer and I am sorry but if ANYTHING exciting happens you would all be the first to know.  Unfortunately I have recently become a loser doing homework, not going out cause I am broke, and looking for jobs...I know I have an amazing life right? hahaha
  Well if anyone has anything cool to say or tell me drop an IM or call. I would love to hear from anyone! hehe talk to you all later...Hugs and kisses
  love-

"event","Everyday I sit here wondering what other people are doing...what if someone at the same time was thinking the same exact thing at that same exact second.  I know it sounds weird and all but I feel like I am living in a dream and what if the person having this dream suddenly wakes up?  Then is my not so perfect life over?  Don't take this is a negative way but I always wonder about these things.  
  On the other hand...O house is great and I love my staff and we are all getting along so well.  I just wish my Stars were here and then the year would be perfect so perfect that it would just be hard to believe it. And I can't believe soon you all will be here.  
  Today we were all talking bout relationships and it put a damper on my day.  I'm not sad that I am not in one but more of the memories I had streaming back the more I wished I hadn't thought even once about dating my ex.  I don't know it just really made me feel uncomfortable...
  I am ready for classes to start, and I am ready to meet new people and very excited.  
  FYI classes start Wednesday....
  So who are all the people coming to visit on a SCAD day cause I am really losing it here with out you all...And please call me...I miss you so much.  I just want to be back in the ballroom sitting with Ky, or my girls you know?  I really made some awesome connections and friendships and I feel like its fading...AND I DONT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN...I love you all. 
  PS  HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARGOT ON THE O HOUSE STAFF!
 leave a comment, call or IM me...I miss you!
    love-

"event","Hey Everyone!
  Well let me first start off by saying I MISS YOU STARS!!! and now for the update!
I AM AN AUNT!  I have a nephew...Ashton...ABSOLUTLEY ADORABLE!
  OK...so in the SAV...I came back and started fall training.  I was a little nervous about the staff at first but they turned out to be FABULOUS!!!  I love them! hehe...good times...I have been really busy and haven't had time to be online or IM people so I decided to keep you all updated with this snazzy deal right here...you like?  So...Our O house staff made a REAL WORLD edition movie of the life at O house...coming soon for your viewing pleasure...VERY VERY FUNNY...Today was check in and it ran so smoothly and went really well and I am very pleased.  I am on duty tonight and luckily we haven't had to deal with any violations or anything...
 While I was at home after Rising star wasn't too exciting...I worked at Applebees and made some money and I bought a new car.  While I was home I was supposed to see Leslie (*) and Jon (*).  Well Lesley never called me which is ok, and Jon and I hung out once and shook our money makers...we went to a club and it was fun but I could tell Jon wasn't really digging it...and thats ok...not everyone can be into right?  So I haven't heard from Jon since that night...  
  I have been receiving all of you Lovin' on my away messages and it makes me smile everyday!  I have talked to Kyle on the phone once and haven't heard from him since...some best friend...poop head...
  I think about Betsy's anal leakage everytime I look at my paper plate award...it hangs right on my wall...
  I miss ALL OF MY GIRLS on my hall and it makes me sad to listen to the CD. but it also reminds me of the good times we had!  REMEMBER TO COME VISIT SOON!
  Well I am off to bed and I hope you all post comments and leave love and all that good stuff...
  Hearts Hugs and Kissies....

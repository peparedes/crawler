Anyway me and devon are beefin like always... dont u see that everytime sumthing happen with other people and me bein round it always come back to me! i dont even give a fuck anymore it seem like she tries to pick evey lil thing out to find an excuse to b mad at me i dont kno why and wat i do to get this shyt but its gettin on my nerves thats why im not tryin to fix things cause its shyt realli and its childish

She mad cause sumone was goin back tellin her i was talkin bout she cant dance and stuff and i kno who went and told her shyt and its funni how they was hangin round for the a while and goin back 2 her and they misinterpreted shyt and always startin makin false accusations but i dont care God knos wat happened and wat was said 

i said it was grimey how she was all over _______ and hogged him all night and she she kno how much i like him and she kno thats wat i said cuz i admit it the others (no names) was agreein with me cuz they saw where i was commin from and no its not cause u danced with them cause dancin fun and aint nuttin its the fact that u was all caressin hands with him and stuff and i dont kno why u was doin it if u was to get me mad and stuff but u crossed the line and u kno it

i have so much proof and it may b that u was mad i was chillen with tiff and was havin a ball with her but i dont care thats my friend also so u neeed to get over it but anyway devon can go ahead and listen to wat other people have to say cuz they will always hav the story mixed up

"event","Your score: 55 


Great Kisser (30-55 points)
Sarah, you are great at kissing: passionate, stormy, sensitive etc. - you know it all. Your kisses come from your heart. You've got the right feeling as you show interest in your partner. For you it's not a competition but real feelings. Sometimes you like to experiment. You always remember that it's not the technique, the strategy or the performance that counts but to have real feelings for your dreamguy. It's not surprising that a lot of guy's (like *****?) fall for you. 

Sarah Francois    ****** ******* 
  
  98 % haaaaaaaaa
and the other with him was 48% haha

(renata ~lysa devon pebbs jasmine yall should get that (Rachelle)


Your score: 45 


Ready or Not? (40-75 points)
Sarah, you're swooning. You stop. You're tingling. You take a break. I can tell you've spent tons of time pondering your prospects and your romantic readiness, but you're not quite sure it's time for a love thing. Hey, there's nothing bad about that. Maybe it's 'cause somewhere way back in your Can I Deal With boy's? closet, you've felt the bruises of a bad breakup or some immature boy's hookup-and-run game.(AMEN) Maybe you're just really into your friends. It won't be long before you're ready to experience romance at it's realest. Keep in mind that being one half of an ""us"" takes a lot more than a tin of Altoids, it takes work! Start looking behind the eyelashes of cuties who could have more-than-friends potential. When you find out what those boys are all about and you feel that you're ready, you'll probably already have Mr. Amazing picked out (like______ perhaps?)   

Your score: 30 


Not in Love (0-30 points)
Sarah, you're definitely not in love. Unless you hate _____, the only reason you two are together is because you want a piece of action! This relationship is not likely to work out and make you happy. The best thing to do is ending this relationship now or work very hard on it.

omg! that is so freaky when they said ""Unless you hate _____, the only reason you two are together is because you want a piece of action!"" that sounds so true on both parts...... hmmm im a virgin and will alwyas be on so yeah...

Your score: 45 


Crush at first sight (25-45 points)
Sarah, you get a crush on somebody like ______ very often. However you know the difference between having a crush on somebody and being in love. When you are interested in somebody very deeply then you use your good sense and curiosity to find out as much as possible about the other person. Your opinion: a crush can start spontaneously, but it takes time to develop deeper and long-lasting feelings. 

thats it for now lol too much ?'s and fun"

So to answer all the questions that u may have regarding me in this stupid young immature situation takin time out of my resting time to answer all of your ?'s so yall can leave me the fuck alone.
Now read this thorougly!

Me and devon are not on speaking terms now. oh WHY? cause...........................
Her an tiffany are both of my friends to begin with and i kno that wat tiffany did was wring but i aint gona hold it against our friendship. Come on now that shyt childish. An i dont wanna hear this from u ""when u were mad at ashley last year u got mad i talked to her"" at i aint sweat it like u r i surpassed it all and was like w/e fuck it cause im pass that. And now u mad cause ia said i aint have a problem with her she cool altjough wat she did may have been bad and wrong. Ok thats done with drop it. Its just like u and jalysa if i got in a situation w/ her or even pebbles or ashley daniels like that u would still talk to them am i right ? YES SIREEEEE! so i dont wanna hear it u mad at me for no reason....

Than u go around telling everybody that im 2 faced! OH HELLL NOOOOO! i am 2 faced cause i was being a friend and tryna get tiffany to talk to u like she asked, im 2 faced cause i told u as a friend wat i heard and sawso u wouldnt get hurt by finding out later when u would regret it, im 2 faced for always looking out for you there in times of ur tears and sadness ok Devon right,

And u kno wat tiffany told me she was gonna approach u cause wat sum1 on the computer instigated and i was gonna tell u but sorry that would be ""2 faced"", i aint kno she was gonna touch u tho.. For now on dont look apon me for nuttin cause the shyt and blame and drama all come back at me and everyone always like awww devon y aint u look out for her sarah.... ummm jalysa ur best friend like u said why didnt she why it have to be me. Stop blamming me fall back i am not the center to ur problems when sumhing goes wrong stop coming at me let me live my life do u 

You can think all that you want tell everyone im 2 faced tell everyone that i laugh at the jokes tiffany say bout u

No i really do not! Tiffany dont even talk bout u to me u do the talkin in ur profile and we all told u not to do that i was lookin out for u but yeah! And when wat went down this morning u said i was laughing no hunn i was down the hall w/ everyone else not even paying attention so wat r u talkin bout i dont kno where u gettin ur sources from but they need to stop. 
And if u think i instigated this thing i didnt and u got it all fucked up cause it was ur best buddy....yep ask jalysa and pebbs even tiff they'll tell u soo do me a favor 
STOP USING ME AS UR SCAPEGOAT! 
its so wierd how me jalysa pebbs and ashley warned u but u did u and look at where u at now

u a whole different person
i want my old friend devon back
wat happenmed to u who are u and wat have u done w/ her
as far as im concerned the old devon was my friend and my twin

Then I went outside after a 2 hour tryout and it was hot well i was hot so i went out w/ out a coat or pants on and i had on shorts. That was only for like 2 minutes tho or less and then i went to morgan house to chillz for a while. Her cousins are madd kool. lol. but yeah can sum1 tell me how the hell i catch a cold. ????? i just dunno. but anyway i have to go to tryouts again tommorrow so i gotta chock that shyt up on the real. Lol, ima cry tommorrow cause i aint gonna feel well to be runnin my heart out like yesterday, i think i might have asthma. (hmmmmmmmmmm) but anyway ...............

LEMME TELL U BOUT WAT HAPPENED WITH ME TODAY! (tru story......)
i went to his house by walking in the freezing cold. There was an empty crib so i just imagined all the lustful things that could go down. I shook a little as i moved my hand to ring the doorbell and removed it after the sound of the bell rung. ""whats good ma"" he said. ""nuttin tired swore"" i said. We shut the door and walked up the stairs into his bedroom. In there we watched music videos on television. I sat on the edge of his most comfortable bed while he sat on the top of his dresser. ""you still swore? ""yeah"" ""come here then"" he said smiling at me w/ his bright ass hazel eyes. i couldnt resist so i approcahed him. He pulled me to the center of the bed and placed me in between his legs and cuddled w/ me. I looked up to my right at him who was cheesin, and i couldnt help but giggle. He starred in my eyes as i stared in his and approached me with his flavorful lips. While exchanging kisses i turned towards him and lay on top of his built muscular body. He held me close as i did the same and we couldnt let go. The love was so wild so loving so real! Just then Ll Cool J's song hush babi came on. That flashed back the time when we were alone after school and that song ran through my head. I made sure every moment that went down was worthwhile. his kisses were breathetaking and all my pain went away. The only thing that mattered was our love for one another. continuing kissing passionately he began to tear my clothing off. Because it was a little difficult for him to remove my tight baby phat jeans i helped him. Not even a minute later i was in a rush to take off his attire. He reached over his bed to get the condum that he had in his wallet. Before he slipped it on i went down on him and gave him exactly what he wanted. He had the biggest penis i've ever seen. Just the look of it frightened me. I savored every moment and licked every piece of precum from his penis. I was very pleased when he came and made sure i didnt miss a drop of his scrumptious flavor! I sucked his dick like there was no tommorrow! Even as he chocked me with it hitting the back of my throat. Soon after he was hard enough and slipped the condum on like he was about to do before. I placed my hand on his dick to put it in so we could save some time. At first he stuck it in a little and took it out after i let out a squeak.""owww!"" i squeaked. After all i was a virgin and never experienced such a sexual sensatation. The second time he went a little further and the third he stuck it all the way in. It was very painful but yet it felt good in a odd way. I could feel him inside of me i could feel him in my stomach. "" im bouts to come"" he whispered in my earWe went at it until he nut. after that we sat down side to side and starred in one another's eyes breathing heavily. He kissed my fore head and pulled me close to him. We fell asleep in one another's arms and woke up right in time before his mother came home to find us together. We walked down the stairs to the front door. He was inside and i was outside the door speaking to him at the door. Just then his mother pulled up through the driveway. I had a big grin on my face and laughed. ""Now my mom home so i can ask her if we can chill tonight sarah"" ""ok... call me i have to go even though i just got here"" i said speaking loudly as he did so his mother wouldnt suspect anything. ""Hi"" his mother said. ""Hi, how are you"" i asked. ""Im doing good and u"" ""im ok thank u"" ""you look tired "" she said. ""Yeah i just came from basketball tryouts and they killed me"" i laughed. ""Oh... well i hope u make it"" ""thank u"" i said. His mother walked into the house and left us alone. ""Bye Sarah"" he said. ""Bye"" i said walking away. "" Wait"" he said walking towards me. ""Yeah"" i said. He moved towards me to kiss me, and i moved up to accept it. I giggled and walked back down to my friends house.

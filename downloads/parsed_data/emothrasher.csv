"event","somehow all my friends parents got a hold of my journal and they all read I think that is a huge invasion of privacy and I didn't know how to make it friends only before so I'm just going to stop writing in here completely I may still comment on other people's journals but Im not sure.

Last night Jason, Matt, Skyler and I all drank too much.  We played on the playground at g-wiz jason puked a couple of times I think we all did but matt. Anyway Jason is real skinny so he got really sick and I told him Matt and Skyler they could sleep in my social library room. I had no idea the security guy goes in there. It was a good thing he did because Jason almost died, he had too much alcohol in his system.  I'm seriously going to quit smoking and drinking now. The police were all in the room they came up here and got me and I had to go down there and talk to them. Last night really sucked! 

Yeah anyway I'm going to be grounded for a lil while:(

sorry we didn't get to hang out today toni.

"event","oh man this weekend has pretty much kicked ass!

Marcie showed up at like 2 this morning at coles and i was all sleeping on the floor cause i had just puked and shes all walking on me with her platforms and shit! 
That was painfull!
Today I think i might go to the skatepark but i dont know if i can get in cause i no banks are open to get the notary signed.
If I dont I will probally hang out with marcie.I hope so.
I hope everyone else had a good weekend.:)"

"event","man today i went skating and i was doing a handrail at davidson drug(actually the bank next to it) and as soon as i land this lady goes wooooah! really loud and i fell into this really spikey bush! That shit pissed me off! So I yelled ""la dee fucking da!"" it was good.
Than later on i was skating over by 7-11 and this old guy walkes by and stops like 2 feet in front of me. He looks at my hair for about a minute and as people are walking by he looks at them like ""hey dont you see this kids hair"" and this would be normall except he just stared for so long and he was so close and didnt say a word and kept walking! It freaked me out. I was trying not to crack up the whole time i did though and it was like he didnt even notice. Fucking tourists! HOLLOWEEN 2 DAYS!!!"

"event","HOLY SHIT it has been a fuck load of a long time since I updated this bitch, actually, i forgot i had it. Anyway, wow, just realized I used a lot of curse words in that last sentence alone. So, now really, anyways, I heard a few days ago my friend sunny's dog was killed when it got hit by a car. That really sucks, because I saw her and her dog the DAY before it happened. This wouldn't be so amazing if it wasn't for the fact that I see her probably 4 times a year. Well, either way, it sucks. I am lucky to have never lost a dog to anything but nature. We had a puppy name Whitney which died when it was only 4 months old, which really sucked, but it got sick and couldn't fight it. I also just saw some of the pictures that Sunny put up of me from her party that night. I look like crap as usual, but dressed fairly nice if it is any consolation...which it isn't. Anyway, too much crap has gone on since I last posted, so who knows, maybe I will keep up with this thing now."

"event","So for the past 2 days I have'nt done much of anything. I have done very little around the house and mostly worked on getting my computer up and running. As you can see, I FINALLY got it all up and running to where I am satisfied enough with it...not completely satisfied, but satisfied enough. It is one beast of a computer. Other than that, I have been very lazy. Never leaving the house unless absolutely necessary. The sad fact is that I have really enjoyed not doing much. I sit around all day watching T.V. and playing games and not really talking to as many people as I should, but I still find it fun. Maybe I just like seclusion. I need a girlfriend so I have someone that I know I can go hang out with and that will pull my ass off the couch and make me go do something. My buddy Frank came back in town a couple of days ago and I was able to have dinner with him and other friends tonight. I don't know what it is, but him and I seem to get along pretty good. I'm kinda tired, seeing how I had a big day and all... :-P  night."

Yep, this is how I felt today. Constantly hit with new shit to do or introducing new crap at my job. We are going to now begin charging people to work on thier computers in our store. This is a good idea, but extremely poorly executed, and on top of that, we don't get any extra income because of it. It is like my job is asking me to now do 2 jobs, but not get any extra money because of my knowledge. It is STRICTLY more money in thier pockets and none in mine. If this is the way things are shaping up, if my knowledge is being exploited, then they can go fuck themselves. It is rediculous to think that I can be a complete retard or I can be intelligent and be exploited and used more than the retard but we would be both paid the same. SO LAME.
On a much happier note, I was able to see my sister, my nephew/Godson Ernie, and my newest nephew Enthony (we just say it Anthony). Enthony has grown huge within the month that I haven't seen him, he is opening his eyes more, looking at you, and smiling a lot. He is just a ton of fun to watch grow up. Ernie is always the same, just a really good kid, rowdy and playful and he is SOOO smart sometimes. He remembers things that not even I remember until I see it, it could be months and he will remember. It is crazy. I also get in my new motherboard and processor tomorrow....hopefully. So lets see if I can't mess up this one like I did the last one eh? Peace."

"event","Hey people, this will be my first post on this site, so if anyone is reading it...great. So anyway, not a really eventful day, started off the day by calling AMD computers because I ordered a product from them and it was defective, therefore they had to replace it, so hopefully it will be here tomorrow. The guy on the phone tried to tell me that they couldn't exchange it because it was out of the 14 day policy that they had, blah blah blah, but I told him that I ordered it before I went on vacation and came back many days after it was delivered and he said it was cool. Went to work at 2 and had to deal with the usual stupid ass people that come into my work. It wasn't too bad today, except for one guy that had to deliberately waste 30 minutes of my day with stupid questions about stuff that he either won't buy or can't afford. SOME ADVICE PEOPLE!!! DON'T FUCK WITH STUFF YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD!!! Drives me insane. I had to close with my dumb ass department manager tonight who does nothing but barks orders left and right and then sits his lazy ass down in the back and does nothing but nitch and complain about numbers. Only good thing was I got to see Stephanie at work tonight. She has the nicest ass. I love it when she wears certain pants, and tonight she wore one of my favorite pairs. Got home and signed up for this thing. Now I'm gonna go play a video game."

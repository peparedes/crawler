You did it again. For forty years, you've made promises, made me love you, and hope for our ongoing relationship. 18-30, you are a lying bitch. You told me, ""This time for sure. This time I will be there for you. This time I will *prove* how much I care"". You *know* that I still wanted you in my life, as a part of the process. I didn't care what your decision was. I just wanted you to show up, and prove that it mattered one way or the other to you. I can't go on like this, 18-30. We're thru'.

"event","The journey started at about 3:00pm on Monday September 20th, 2004. A friend and I loaded up the car for a trip to Washington DC to visit the grand opening and related festivities for the National Museum of the American Indian ( http://www.nmai.si.edu/ ). The trip was pretty long, but the scenery is gorgeous all the way there. PA is a pain in the ass state as far as the pressure in my ears is concerned, but the things you see in the early morning as you drive thru' are amazing. Is it fog climbing up that valley twards you, or is it a cloud bank. You tell me. 

On the outside of DC, we parked the car, and hoped onto the Metro. The pass that you had to buy is a minimum of $10.00, but if you pay with a $20.00, the least it will give you is $15.00 credit. And your change is spit back as $5.00 worth of Quarters. Well, that was fun to carry all over DC in my pocket. But, as far as mass transit goes, the Metro is quite nice. The cars a carpeted, the seats are not ripped, and the walls and windows are clean. The maps of all your connecting lines are easy to read. Over all, pretty easy for a first timer in the city to navigate. 

After climbing out of the Metro tunnels ( like the Morlocks, in The Time Machine ) we were not quite sure of our way around and needed a helpful hand. Hopefuly one with a pointing finger. Two police officers ( one of whom was holding an automatic rifle at the ready!!! ) were nice enuff to point the way. 

This building is wonderful. It looks nothing like all the other moldy old government buildings that surround it. Beautiful, and very Native American. 

Our time was limited ( about three hours ) so all we saw was the end of the procession, and the speaches at the Opening Ceremony. I will cut and past the speakers from the official webpage.

The program will include remarks from the National Museum of the American Indian Director W. Richard West, Jr., Smithsonian Secretary Lawrence M. Small, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Senator Daniel K. Inouye.

Not listed above is the Presidant of Peru who also gave a wonderful speech. 

The speeches were amazing. All of them were full of pride, and inclusiveness, and maybe a little of kicking whitey's tailbone? Yes, that too. 

The friend I went with kept getting upset about all the very very ( VERY ) white people who were in the procession, and who were all decked out in traditional dress. He does have a valid point here. I'm sure there were several people there who just wish SO MUCH that this was *their* cultural heritage, that they end up co-opting it. ( Like whitey is prone to do ) I am also sure that a good number of those people are only one eight, or one thirty second Native blood. But, here's the point. It's the big point, so be ready to take notes. 

The Native American culture has taken alot of hits over the last two hundred years. This is a group of people who could have went on the endangered species list, if it had existed back then. In the last several decades, the young of this culture has been neglecting it, or rejecting it entirely. We now think of Native Americans two way in this country. As the brown dudes that John Wayne used to shoot the hell out of, or as today's casino owners. Several of the Native American languages are dying out. No one wants to learn them, or the customs that go along with them. So, to my friend I would say ( at some time when he is not too tired and stressed to listen ) that, who *cares* if these people are white, or are mostly white. Are they willing to carry on the traditions? Are they willing to learn, and teach, and grow? 

The roots of this tree have been dying for years. The leaves want to become birds. So what if the maple leaves want to become oaks. Let them become oaks. And allow them the pride they deserve for the accomplishment."

"event","As I wash the grave dirt off my hands, I remember her. My little black skulker. The hunter. She used to wait for me in the driveway to come back home if I went on a walk. And before she died, that is the last thing she did. 

She must have been hit by a car. I could see no injuries, only that she had bled from her mouth and nose. She was stiff, but still warm when I found her at the end of the driveway. She must have just died not more than an hour or two before I found her.

I then dug a final resting place for my constant outside companion, placed her in it, made an offering to the four spirits. I then stroked her side one last time, and filled in the hole. I then placed a large sandstone I brought back from PA almost a year ago on top of her grave, cut some roses that I put in her now emptied food bowl, and placed that on the stone. I then lit four cardinal candles, and sat vigil for about an hour, thinking of her, and remembering her. 

I will miss her crying when I go away on a walk, or when she wanted me to come outside and spend time with her. I will miss her leaping on to my back in the winter and climbing to my shoulder. I will miss hearing her jingeling collar when she comes running because she heard me come outside. I will miss her yelling at me to tell me that some animal was eating her food. But most.... I think I will miss her waiting for me at the end of the driveway, waiting for me to come back home. I love her for doing it one last time.

I will miss you Parvati"

a meme found by veraxia:

Invent a memory of me and post it in the comments. It can be anything you want, so long as it's something that's never happened. Then, of course, post this to your journal and see what people would like to remember of you, only the universe failed to cooperate in making it happen so they had to make it up instead."

"event","On the subject of plans.... I have decided to stop making them. Oh, I'll still have *ideas* of things I want to do, and maybe *suggest* that I do them with other people, but the days of hard and fast concrete planning are done. I mean, what's the point? It always seem the more details I lay out, the less likely they are to pan out. Oh the other hand, if I do things that are a rough idea, on a moment's notice, that is always fun, or at least an adventure. 

As we lay this husk of Plans in it's eternal grave, we weep not, we mourn not for you, yer Bastard!"

"event","So, I now believe that every two out of five drivers in the Metro Detroit area have a broken left hand. This *must* be the case, or they'd be USEING THEIR FUCKING TURN SIGNAL!!!! This goes right along with my theroy that any driver who can *NOT* place the tags correctly on their licence plate must be both a moron and danger to everyone on the road. Don't laugh, I have proved this point to myself, time and time again. When you get behind that troglobyte brained lump of pre-human clay that has his tags in all three of the four  corners of his plate, watch him for about a minute and a half. I promise you, he *will* do something stupid. When the revolution comes, people who can not correctly place their tags on their plates will be boiled and searved with ranch dressing."

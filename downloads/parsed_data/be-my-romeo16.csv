"event","updates.. well Shelby and i went to the beach yesterday. a lot of fun, like always. hung out for a while at mcdonalds, got invited to some sandalwood party which we won't go to i'm sure, went to the beach, said really mean things, got a free red bull from some guy, got ritas, met up with Josh, Matt, and Miguel at the beach, said more mean things, Shelby and i made Josh mad by talking through our eyes, went to work, saw amityville with Francesca, it was REALLY good and REALLY scary, thought some mean things but didnt have to say them out loud because me and Francesca don't need words to communicate, now im going to work 10-3. *sigh."

"event","spent the night with LAUR on saturday night.. which was a lot of fun. ;) haha. we hung out with Matt and Miguel again then went to her house and watched some of the notebook, ate peanut butter, and took crazy pictures. it was great. :) then we went to the beach sunday with Katie and Lauren's lil sister and the best part was- we had Al's freakin WHITE pizza... which is amazing. i thought it'd be cool to work there.. but there is no way i could be around that pizza all the time without eating it all, i wouldn't be a good waitress there. even more excited about prom now, even though it's getting so worn out and i really want it to be over with, i still can't wait. everyone is stressing out about what to do for dinner.. what to do with their hair... and especially what to do afterwards. but, that's how it goes. i'm trying not to worry about it more than i have to, because when it comes down to it it's not a big deal and i'd rather just play the whole night by ear. but i'm excited. <3"

i don't mean to complain, gosh i hate complaining but it is your choice to read it or not. you can't say i didn't warn you.
i hate track. i used to love it. now.. i just... it's not fun anymore. i'm basically the only long distance girl that shows up.. and how fun is it running alone? and i just don't like it. probaby because i suck and i feel like i haven't improved very much at all.. only like 17 seconds. freakin' woo hoo. and during cross country i only improved by a few minutes. i miss running with people, that's what it is. it's just not the same anymore. now when ashley and lauren come to practice it's better, and i do a lot better. but i still miss running with friends. i want to do more of those races around town, like the pace race and stuff, but no one else does. and like i said, going and running alone just isn't as fun. i mean, i'd do it.. but it's so much better when you have someone to wear the shirt with the next day at school. hehe. :) 
david (my dad) is driving my craazzyyy. like absolutely crazy.
i'm getting tired of this prom thing. don't get me wrong i'm SO so excited about it and the group i'm going with... it's just. i was so happy... then something that could be better happens.. and when it doesn't end up happening nothing is as good enough... that probably doesn't make sense. but it's like having a one scoop ice cream cone and being really excited about it.. then getting to look at and almost touch a three scoop cone, but then you don't get it so you're stuck with the one scoop cone, and all of a sudden the one scoop cone just isn't as good as it looked before you saw the three scoop cone. comparisons suck. if it wasn't for people comparing everything, then everything could be perfect. you'd think you had the perfect dress if you didn't see one that you liked ten times better. because well if you didn't compare it to a better one then the one you had would still be perfect. i'm not sure if this makes sense to any of ya'll but it does to me."

"event","i never write in here anymore.. or get online.. so here's the updates that i can remember...
spring break started off sucky, but it is gradually getting better. friday night all the people i'm going to prom with all hung out. and now i'm really excited.. like i was before. i love the guys, glad i'm getting to know them, they're a lot of fun. i gotta call the Core to talk to Holly about beach shows this summer. that's the only modeling thing i will do here.. i hate modeling in jacksonville. it's like.. nothing. it's not important to me because ANYone can do it. maybe i'm just weird.. and picky. but i still refuse to do most of it. anyways.. Sunday morning i got up and went to the beach to go running. it was such a nice day, and i layed out for a while. i was by myself, but it felt nice. being alone feels great once and a while. then i came home and washed and waxed my car. gotta keep that black looking good. :) that night i went with Francesca, John, and John's friend (i forget his name..) to see the ring2. it sucked. i hated it. it went on forever... and ever. some of it was scary though, i will admitt. monday night i hung out with Shelby, Thelma, Paulina, David, Josh, and David & Josh's friends. went to  some guys apartment, went to mcdonald's cause it's the cool place to hang out, went home. wednesday i took Thelma and Paulina to the beach. it was fun... got a lil bit of sun. :) and i got to talk to Thelma, which i never really get to do. i'm applying for adventure landing. i'm really excited. Shelby said i could just stay with her the days that i worked consecutively. so i'm excited that i get to spend so much time at the beach. this is if her dad let's me. :) and being a lifeguard would be so much fun. i'll be tan, yayy. :) and when my cousin comes to visit she'll have something to do when i'm working. last night i hung out with Shelby, Jared, and Rodney. but first Shelby and i went to Copelands to eat and see Rob. we cleaned my dad's house for money, so we went somewhere nice. we never get to do that, so it was fun. and the food was amazing. :) doubt i'll ever go there again though. going to work today.. and tomorrow... and the next day. which is fine, i'm excited about the money. :) hanging out with my girl F-CAT tonight.. woopwoop. :) :)"

"event","sooo NY was amazing! it snowed the whole time, which kind of sucked, but it was awesome because it's been forever since i've seen snow. went shopping and got another prom dress so i'm taking the other one back. i'm really excited about prom now, my dress it kind of.. wild, i guess you could say, and i love it. so tuesday i went to most of the agencies. i finally met my agent, Ellen! she told me that if the agencies just say ""okay thanks for coming"" then it's usually not a good sign, but if they introduce you to other agents or take your picture then it's a good sign. and all but one of the agencies did both. one of the agencies was a complete jerk. i will never work for them, recommend them, or talk to them ever again. they sat there for like 20 minutes and told me everything that was wrong with me. every agency has a different look that they want, so obviously you can not fit every agency's look. and i can totally deal with that. i can deal with ""well thanks but you don't have the right look for our agency."" but for them to sit there after they tell me that and point out everything that makes me not right for their agency.. yeah i could of done without that, but i got over it. i wanted to cry at the time, honestly, but i didn't. that was the only one that said anything remotely like that, so that's good. the agency that i really want is ELITE. i met with Karen Lee, who is the president and another guy from there. they were awesome, so nice, and helpful. well Karen was talking to me and she was like ""well i've been tracking you for about two years and you've never been quite ready because of your age and stuff, but now... you're ready."" that was like the best thing she could of said. i'm finally freakin' ready! i have to work on a couple minor things before summer. they are having an ELITE model look contest again. i did the same contest in miami before. it's like a bunch of small contests then all the winners go to nationals and the winner gets a contract with ELITE. well today i found out that the contests are rigged, and they are going to rig it for me. not nationals but the small ones to get to nationals. which is kind of depressing, lol, but at least the agency wants me enough to rig it for me. lol.. i guess. well anyways.. NY Models agency, the guy said i should go to Australia. what they do is they send the girls abroad and while they are there they get their book put together and work a little for the experience. then when they come back they are these great models. it's like they send them to the other countries to do the dirty work. well Karen Lee and the guy from ELITE asked my mom how she would feel about me going to Australia, or maybe just staying in NY for a month over summer. my mom said it'd be fine.. so we'll see what happens. they wanted me to have a shoot on wednesday morning before i left but there wasn't enough notice and photographers were booked, so i just went back the next day and Karen took pictures of me. better than nothing to show to the other agents. soo i'm really excited about everything, and everything with ELITE went very well. i freakin' love NY. i want to live there. there's so many people and i like that. it's like.. no ones cares about you and you pass thousands of people every day and not one of them tries to get in your business and you will never see any of them again. everyone is solo. they don't look at you as you pass because they don't care about you. and that's a really good feeling believe it or not. i would just love to live in NY, no need for a car, just walk everywhere. and there is so much to do. it's not scary like everyone thinks it is. well i mean, there definitely is a lot of crime, but it's not like i walked around scared the whole time. i just love it up there."

"event","i got my outfit for NY and my prom dress. i'm really excited about both. i'm also going to look for a dress while i'm up north, and if i find a better one then i'm going to return the one i got here. :) i went and saw constantine last night.. it was a good movie. i reccommend it. apparently i'm a ""horrible driver"".. lol. i'm still adjusting to this whole automatic thing... the thing is, i can't control my speed as much anymore. well i guess i could if i really tried... but it's harder without a manual. 
well anyways... i didn't get to see Francesca or Holley this weekend.. again. and next weekend i'm going out of town. i miss those girls. we were going to go to lunch today but i have a lot to do.. and the weather is bad anyways. 
i was talking to Francesca about the whole Manny thing... it's like what is happening to her recently happened to me so i can totally understand how things will never be just completely normal between them. it's like... you can be your stupid self around every guy but him. and it doesnt even matter if your feelings for him aren't there anymore.. it will always be different. and you think to yourself ""well i'm only this way around him because i have feelings for him... so why is he the same way around me... unless he has feelings for me too...?"" but bottom line... it can never be normal. at least not in my experiences. i bow down to any girl who can do it. 
my friend was telling me the other day that she has feelings for her best guy friend, and she wanted my advice on if she should tell him or not. well, i for one am not going to sit around and tell somebody ""yeah tell him... because if he's really your best friend it won't change anything"" because it does change everything. maybe not at first... but eventually it will. it's inevitable. i'm not saying that you will lose this friend, i'm just saying it COULD change things. and it's up to you to make that decision. but i would tell him. it's going to knag at you if you do tell him and it's going to knag at you if you don't. 
and if you do lose a friend. it all goes downhill from there.  you can sit around and try to remember the good times all you want... it still hurts just as bad when you pass that person in the hallway and you don't even look at each other. and it sill hurts just as bad when he comes and sits next to you at the lunch table. and it still hurts just as bad when people talk about him in front of you all the time. and it still hurts just as bad when you see him with some other girl, or you hear stories about him and some other girl. or guy. (lol.. j/k...)
the point is... it's inevitable.
it's kind of hard to master the first step which is staying out of his buisness, the more you know the more you have to dwell on.. the less you know the better you feel. kind of hard when people tell you his business all the time. you can try to stay away and physically you can... but when someone tells you something about him you can't just be like ""wait! no take it back!! i didn't want to knoooowww!!"" lol. 
and then you get really pissed off because you figure out that he was right when he told you that you ""need"" him. which you don't NEED him but you feel 100 times better after talking to him. but you would never tell him that. 
so i guess all you can do is remember the past... you just have to realize that the guy you liked so much isn't the same guy anymore. and he's not going back to the way he was. and you probably don't even want him to.
it's the best AND worst feeling to know that this guy you liked so much isn't even someone you want to be with. best because it feels great to know that, and you can learn to laugh at him inside when he tries to play another game with you. and worst because things STILL can't be normal... and that's frustrating. but, lol, i do think the laughing on the inside beats the frustration. it's a great feeling when you know what he's going to say next, but he doesnt know you know.. so he thinks he's tricking you into something, and you let him think he is just to humor yourself. that's when the relationship gets interesting. 

inevitable.

but anyways... i had a great weekend, spent with shelby and thelma, who are awesome. oh and i totally introduced thelma to two new american foods, biscuits and gravy and ravioli! and she liked them both, which makes me happy. i love that girl. we all had a lot of fun together this weekend, matching and everything. hehe. 
track practice was tuesday. best and most i have ever ran. did stadiums.. they are so much fun! i love them. haha. killers though. the best part of tuesday (worst part?) was forgetting my track clothes... so i had to wear andrew's baseball shorts, thelma's white shirt with a black bra and shoes that were too small. needless to say.. my feet were killing me. i have blisters but i'll get over it. :)
i wanted the eagles to win sunday.... but the only reason is because the fans were a lot of fun, party animals, the way i like it. ;) and now NE is tied with the 49ers joe montana, winning three superbowls. so that sucks. joe montana is on my wall. haha.
i'm worried about my little cousins. :( i just want to go out there and take them all home with me and take care of them. but i can't do that... trust me-if i lived on my own and had the power to make that decision i would. please pray for them.

this girl i took acting classes with when i was in.. i think 8th grade, maybe some of 9th.. she just called me. it was really weird. but good weird. if that makes sense. we just had an hour long conversation about basically everything. i'm a little shocked that she still remembers me and called. it was very nice of her. so i guess people really do try to keep in touch. makes me happy. :)

friday night i hung out with Holley. we went to Al's for dinner, $1.50 off coupon, heck yes! then we went to the soccer and basketball games... soccer first where we lasted a whole 30 seconds before we decided it was way too cold, so we went to the basketball game for a while, then back to the soccer game after half time. it was cold, but i found us the best seats in the stadium. haha. and we got to see Zach play. :)we then went to starbucks and rented cellular. the movie sucked.. and it had so much potential but there were all these really random pointless scenes in it. really weird... 
last night i picked Francesca up at 11 and we went the hotel that Kyle and all them rented. it was a lot of fun. but i really do not feel good today. :/ Cameron taught me how to drink hard liquor without it really getting to you (the taste).. haha. and it works too! 
Holley and i had a good talk friday night. well... i don't know if i'd classify it as ""good""... kind of depressing. but at least we feel the same. i just don't understand why guys want the slutty girls. they'd rather go off with a girl with a horrible personality that puts out than a girl with a good personality that doesn't. i see where the priorities are. but i GUESS that is understandable... but i have a feeling it won't be that way for long. it's just really not worth it to me to become one of ""those"" girls. i mean, for whose sake would i be doing it for? at least we have some respect for ourselves... but then again.. who really cares? the word respect seems so overrated.

shelby complained that i never update this anymore, so here it is shelby! (i'm not looking at the keyboard! hah!) lol. okay anyways... last night was Miss Paxon, which was way long, but it was fun. brittany won, which i'm happy about. i expected kyla to win but i'm happy for brittany, she had a really good talent, i give her major props for doing all those twists in the air and stuff. hehe. KERRY came. third weekend in a row that i've seen her, which is way cool. :) then shelby and thelma and i went to get sundaes from mcdonald's.... duh. we always do. we ended up going over to josh's to watch a movie. i fell asleep.. lol. thelma and i slept through basically the whole thing. got home at 4 in the morning... (mama wasn't home all night)... this morning me and thelma made french toast and then we all went to mcdonalds and had sundaes, again... lol. i love hanging out with those girls. i love reminissing with shelby about all the crazy things we have done. and just the stupid things we have done. (which there are a lot of) we have gotten away with so much that it amazes me. and we figured out why- it's because we are smart and because our parents aren't good friends. lol. hey getting caught two times out of... (how many weekends are in a year)... lol. 
so i really want to go running outside but nooo. everytime i do i get sick. i ran last wednesday and i haven't felt good since then. damn the cold air. grrr. 
ohh yeah.. so i'm going to new york in march! woopwoop. i called Ellen last week and she said that the next day she was having a meeting with Karen Lee (president of ELITE) to discuss when they want me to come. it made me feel special... like wow, they are having a meeting and they are going to be talking about me. hehe. Ellen said that Karen is upset that we are going to other agencies too... hah. i'm like ""well sign me and i won't!!"" lol. i'm going to ELITE first, then the others. because ELITE is what i really want. Ellen told her that another agency is ready to sign me so maybe that will make her take some action. if not, i'll just go with the other one. it kind of makes me feel like i'm settling though. i mean shoot, any agency will do just fine, but i really want ELITE. i feel like the other ones aren't good enough. ELITE is number one, so that's what i want. and i'm not saying this in a conceited way... it's just what i want. i want the best. but we'll see how it goes. so Ellen said for me to keep working out and keep growing my hair out. (which i want so badly to cut!) speaking of working out.. i'm about to go to the gym. :)"

REALLY stupid. but the best part was when the girl forgot to take the hamster wheel out of the cage so the hamster killed itself, im guessing it didnt know how to use the wheel. lol. who thinks of that kind of stuff? saturday we went looking at houses. yayyy. drove all around mandarin. but i think we are going to move closer to like the st. johns bluff-southside, area. i'm really not sure. i went and saw Shelby perform at thespians. :) they did very well. and it was fun, i got to see matt, but i didn't get to see him perform. that night i hung out with Kerry and her friend DD. we saw coach carter, it was really good. THEN we drove all around mandarin and looked at all the huge houses. drove by ""whats his names"" house a few times, haha. (KERRY!) and i went to the loop for the very first time. how exciting is that. sunday i went to the gym for a couple hours... felt so good. Kyle is grounded so me, Rob, and Shelby went over to his house to watch a movie. but before Shelby got there we had a huge pillow fight, and i lost. Kyle, Rob, and Kyle's little brother all against me, that's totally not fair!! lol. it was fun though. then we watched collateral. man, i watched a lot of movies this weekend. man, little kids are really good at making me feel stupid. 
""well... uhh.. hellooo, the main character just died""
so i went back home with shelby and spent the night. we were so tired so we basically went right to sleep. we had nothing to talk about... it's either because our lives are really boring or because we don't worry about those things anymore so we dont talk about them. and i think that's the reason. which i'm proud of us for. :) we got up in the morning and i helped Shelby clean her room, yayyy. but the best part was making cookie dough for breakfast, sneaking it into her room, and eating it!! yummm!"

"event","okay so i absolutely love brad and jen.. and now they are separating. :( how sad. anyways.. last night i went to the soccer game and basketball game. woop woop. kerry came and she spent the night. :) after the games we went to mc donalds, to get a sundae! because everyone knows i'm in love with them. :) and i'm in love with the price. we ended up going to this park by my house, which was a really sweet place. and it's like 5 minutes from my house. yessss there are things to do on the westside! it was good krista-kerry bonding time. that girl hates boys... and it's great. but when i say hate i mean love so much she hates. if that makes any sense at all. so we went to blockbuster to get a sad movie.. and picked out this movie called ""garden state."" so i get home and i take it out and i'm just staring at the dvd... because it has freaky creatures on it and it looks really scary.. then i realize we got some movie called ""gargoyles""... i can't say thats the type of movie we were looking for. but we watched it anyways... well not exactly. i dont think the first 30 minutes counts as watching it. it was horrible! so i'm taking it back to get another one, the one we wanted! lol.. so i had a nightmere about a spider last night. i was dreaming that it was right above my head and that sucker was HUGE! i can still picture it. so i'm like ""kerry! kerry!!"" haha.. and she wakes up and freaks out. man, i'm glad that was a dream. otherwise i would have been a goner. gooosshhh i hate spiders. i'm still a little freaked out about it. lol. i went to the gym today... i only have like a couple weeks til track starts. man, i'm really nervous about track. but i'll get over it. i need a running buddy."

"event","okay i completely cannot take it anymore. omg... i wanted to scream at dinner tonight. ""eww dip is so gross, how can anyone do that"".. yeah well smoking is just as bad and you smoke a pack a day. ""i'm tired of people making smoking comments..ive been doing it for 30 years."" well dont talk about how gross it is when people dip if you smoke, how are you going to sit there and make ""dip is gross"" comments when you hate when people make ""smoking is gross"" comments..  dip is to him what smoking is to you. ohh but that's right.. everything you do is okay, as long as its okay with you it should be okay with everyone else. sorry, how dare ME forget. and if i hear another ""gosh she's so large"" comment i'm going to hurt somebody. real nice of you to say. your not so great yourself, you know. what really is the point of making a comment like that.. what are you gaining from it. absolutely nothing. just making yourself look like a jackass, so why don't you keep it up because that's what you are. 

okay enough of that... okay... but i had to get that out. anyways... new years was fun! :) spent it with holley, francesca, shelby, rob, and kyle, and a few other people. great group of people. somehow we managed to let david and kyle s spend the night without francesca's parents knowing. lol. go us! hehe. saturday i went to dave and busters for the first time. omg.. the desserts are to die for. i'm thinking of going just for the dessert, that's all i can afford anyways. then i went to jax raceways. okay so my mom told me to turn the wrong way and i took the guys down this long scary road... oops. it was one of those really foggy roads you see in horror movies. and this truck was on the side of the road... right when we pass the headlights turn on and it starts following really close behind manny, christian, and robert. kind of freaky... but i got us there! :) and it was pretty awesome. i had fun. drew was there racing, so that was exciting. 

okay now this next part is strictly for kerry. i know everyone else will read it too and that's fine.. but i think only kerry will understand what i'm talking about. so this is for you, kerry. like i said, my mouth dropped when i read what you wrote. holy crap girl. i totally just went through that. i mean, like exactly. like, wow. okay... you can tell the difference between someone kissing you like they mean it and someone kissing you as a ""hook up."" and it's only a hook up is both people know it is. otherwise, someone gets hurt. you say he kissed you like he meant it, you need to talk to him about it. seriously, you deserve it. don't let him ""get away"" with that. friends dont kiss friends. at least not like that. if it means something to you then it means something. you've liked him for a long time, it's time one of ya'll take some action, hehe. so you gotta get brave and tell him how you feel!! you'll feel better afterwards (no matter what he says.) trust me. anyways, he should be lucky to have you like him. and if things dont go like you want them to, cry a little, then get over it. ""if you don't care i don't care."" if it's not meant to be, then there's another plan for you. so basically, (from personal experience), remember- friends dont kiss friends the way he kissed you and tell him how you feel. i'm not saying things will go perfectly because sometimes it doesn't give like it takes... but you'll feel better that you were brave and that you got it off your chest. hope that kind of helps, maybe. that's what i've learned at least... <3

i'm really happy."

"event","yesterday ended up being a really good day. :) francesca and i went to al's for lunch and then we went around to businesses in five points to sell ads for the miss ed white program. that got really interesting considering we were in five points. we walked into a store called ""nicotine"" to sell an ad for a high school program. lol... well they did have some skate stuff too.. but yeah, with a name like nicotine, it didn't go over to well. then we went to this italian restaurant with this sweet italian guy who had an italian accent. you had to be there for that one. we ended up with $85! woohoo! go us. only like 300 to go! haha. it was a lot of fun though. then shelby came over for dinner. :) yayyy. then we went to brusters, i hoped to see lauren but she wasnt working. ohh and finally i got to see when harry met sally. which is a really good movie.

another highlight of my day was shelby's dad showing us a clip from america's funniest home videos. oh my gosh... i never knew that show was so funny. we were watching clips of gymnasts. talk about funny. lol. it's funny that people get enjoyment out of watching them bust their butts.

so its new year's eve. i'm working then going to francesca's for the night, and some people are coming over there. i have to spend new years with holley and francesca and shelby.. it's a must. at least i know it won't turn out like last year. it's amazing to think that was a whole year ago, seems like only a few months.

another highlight of my day was talking to shelby last night. (yess there's more!!) and realizing that whoa, things changed. and they have been this way for a while. but when you do something for so long it's weird for it to not be there anymore. it was always comfortng for it to be there so i never let go... but adios. 

well im really really excited that it's a new year. i'm so ready for it. :)"

BUT it was dark and she was wearing a big jacket with fur around the hood. (and she has really cute ear rings lol) sunday night i saw ""footloose"" because i'm apparently the only loser who hadn't seen it, or even heard of it. so i watched it with rob and his mom. kyle came over to rob's and we went to go play pool.. but they were closed, which is gay. shelby met us up there. (love your haircut shelby.. lol) according to shelby we played hide and seek in wal mart... lol. shelby came back to my house to spend the night. which was good krista-shelby time. we haven't hung out like at all out of school, it was well needed. monday we went to lunch with nicole, holley, stacie, and rachel. it was a lot of fun. good talks. haha. girl talk... every guys nightmere. lol. holley and i went to the mall where we did a horrible shopping job. we were so over it. once again, i hate the orange park mall during christmas. stayed home that night with my mom and watched christmas movies. family tradition. :) been working every day, which is fine, i need the money. last night i stayed home and wrapped everyone's presents. and i watched sister act 2! that's one of my favorite movies along with coyote ugly. (which is my inspiration) i haven't talked to maddie for more than 5 minutes in the past week and i feel like i'm missing something. i miss hearing her drama. she has enough drama for the both of us..

Eric met us up at school wednesday. hadn't seen him in like six whole months. and Charlie came to eat too. it was almost like a tv production reunion, but we were missing L.L. :( hehe the good ol' days. doing group projects in tv class... our projects freakin' rocked! haha. (especially the mohawk one lol) friday after work i went over to Holley's. which was of course a lot of fun. once again the ""drop the bag"" method proved itself. all five of us (Holley, Shelby, Rachel, Francesca, and I) slept on Holley's bed. which was quite interesting. hey, i slept fine. the best part was waking up an hour early because Holley accidentally changed her clock. lol. good job Holley, hehe. we had some Krista-Shelby-Holley-Francesca rebonding time. and we all worked out. plan for me and Shelb- we are staying after school to work out together once a week. (Shelby's idea)  :)  
i work just about every day over the break, which is fine with me. i need the money. hung out with Eric tonight. him and my mom had a ""cool-test"" and my mom definitely won. haha. we went to go visit Francesca at work and when we were pulling into the parking lot she called me because she was on her break and wanted to know what i was up to. how awesome is that! so i was like ""ummm come out from the back..."" man, we really do has esp(n). lol. we are SO here. <3
i think i'm going to go finish up my Christmas shopping after we go out to lunch on Monday. gosh, i hate the malls during this time of year. i'm not looking forward to it.

""it's juicing""- Holley
""it's getting bigger!!""- me

haha. we really should think about what we say when other people are around. then Holley and i went to help Stacie pick out a present for her boyfriend. we all decided we liked guys clothes better than girl's and that we want to wear them. :) we ended up picking out some awesome smelling cologne, that he ended up liking! Holley and i were definitely entertained. haha.

stayed after school friday to work out a little bit. then i went to the play that night, which was fun. we all went out to Denny's afterwards to celebrate Shelby's birthday.

""we are so here"" all the time. haha. and i kind of feel bad about that, but what can you do? GIRLS ARE JERKS!! i'll admitt that. toDAY was fun. toNIGHT sucked. we decorated my house today and made it Christamsy. AND we baked some cookies!! yumm. my mom and i do it every single year, and Francesca helped us this year. :) so Francesca and i came up with a little speech that we are going to give to each other when needed. such as, when we get upset over pety things and guys. it's a great speech, so we made a deal that we'd give it to each other when we thought the other needed it. because EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. and that's the basic idea of the speech. :) makes me really happy. tonight was gay. gay. gay. GAY!! party in ortega, didn't stay long enough to enjoy it. but i did get to see Drew and Andrew again! :) party in arlington. ehh. 50 people in a tiny apartment trying to be quiet which is impossible, and mentioning cops every 5 minutes is NOT something you do under those circumstances. and that SO would not have been worth it. well, actually, none of the things i've been CAUGHT for have been worth it. but some of those times i consider worth it, if i would have gotten caught, i woulda been just fine. shoot, as long as its worth it in some way or another. ;) kind of like those times when your like ""if i were to have died right then, at least i would have died happy"""

Friday i ended up doing a little shopping with my mom. i really didn't want to shop that day because everyone was, but it was INEVITABLE. so i'm in the dollar store and this guy comes up to me and tells me he likes the color of my toe nail polish. which is weird enough... but then he asks me what brand my flip flops are, and i tell him roxy, and he asks to see the signature on the shoe. so i take my shoe off and he picks it up... so i'm thinking he's about to take it and ima be shoeless. but THEN he puts the shoe down and picks up my foot and says i have the foot of a famous supermodel and walks away... really weird. who tells you they like the color of your toe nail polish? especially when it's chipping off. lol. so i'm not feeling the whole dollar store thing right now. after work Francesca and i went to Joe's. and i must say- that was one of the funnest times i've had there. watching Drew drive my car is exciting. lol. because he gets so excited. and i carried Drew and Andrew on my back. and they thought i was weak! ha! today Francesca and i went to lunch with Shelby. :) and we did shopping and we got matching ""stuff"" yes! now all we need to do is party, go into a bathroom together, and rediscover ""this"" lol. (and only Shelby knows what i'm talking about haha) we went to Emily's tonight, the first time we went it wasn't too great cause it was early. so we left and met Rob and Kyle at this girl's birthday party. we didn't know anyone but it was cool. then the guys wanted to go to Emily's so we ended up going back with them. and it was fun the second time! :) so we told Kyle that Francesca had her license and he let her drive his explorer there. how classic is that. she barely ever drives and she only has her permitt. but they made it. and it was probably even safer than Kyle driving. maybe, hehe.

Jenn was saying things like ""i told my sister that she needs to tell the family that she's pregnant so that they can buy her stuff, because we don't have money, and we need them to buy the baby stuff, so she needs to tell them."" i was like.. wow. which she does need to tell her whole family, i mean duhh, but she wants to do it for the wrong reasons. that's just really messed up. and yes my cousin ran into the garage... apparently she was driving the car into the driveway and hit the wrong pedal or something. i really don't understand. but whatever. i miss Jessica and Michelle like crazy. i want them to move back in. but that won't ever happen.

Ms Theresa is in her late 80's. she's so cute. she has alzheimers so she repeats everything a billion and twenty five times. so we basically had the exact same conversation 100 times. but i love her stories! she was awesome. her husband was in world war II and she had their baby when he was in war, but he got wounded so he got to come home and see the baby, but then he went back and he died in war when the baby was six months. :( so she had to work. Caroline was telling us that there weren't enough guys to do all the jobs on base so they started hiring women. and she showed us Theresa's certificate. she worked on planes because she was little and she could fit in he small spaces. how sweet is that! apparently, she was very independent and stuff. i love that lady. and even though i hear her stories over and over they are really interesting and each time she tells them she adds something, so it gets more interesting. hehe. well time for bed. <3"

Adams got hurt and i almost cried. his daddy picked him and up and carried him out. it was adorable. hehe. i had a lot of fun though. i watched like 12 minutes of the girls game before i left. (sorry i couldn't stay for more.) 
okay so news of the day- I'M GOING TO NEW YORK CITY BABY! hehe. well my agent called today and talked to my mom. she said that she went to this meeting with a bunch of agents in New York and showed them my pictures and they really liked them! Ellen (my agent) told them about what happened in Miami and they said ""Well she's not a Miami girl, she's a New York girl, she has the New York look."" so i'm going to New York during spring break this year and Ellen is going to take me to all the agencies. i finally get to meet her! i'm really excited about that too. we have been talking on the phone for about two years now. i thank her so much and i can't wait to meet her. and it's going to look so good going into agencies with her especially. she's really known. :) nothing makes me happier, seriously. BUT i can';t get too excited. seriously only one in a million girls get to do this, but only one in a million of them actually get signed and stuff so i can't get all worked up. i'm just REALLY excited right now. like this is it. :) not to mention i'm scared to death. hehe. can't wait! :)"

"event","last weekend was alright. Friday after work Francesca and i went to Al's pizza. it was so good. :) plus we had some catching up to do, i hadn't seen her in forever it seemed like. then we met up with Shaun and played pool... okay so we did horrible. lol. so what? (i still won last Friday night ;) haha) well actually, we did pretty good on the ""speed pool"" game. and with some more ""Francesca and Krista moves"" we would have won!! Saturday i went shopping in St. Augustine with my Mom, Debbie, and Michelle. which is always fun. :) so... that night was movie night. we watched Van Helsing. i fell asleep so it couldn't have been that great. but it was alright from what i did see. my dad wanted me to go with him to the mall sunday to help him pick our drapes and all this stuff because he's redecorating two rooms... and he ended up not feeling up to it, so we didn't go. he was ""sick"" and i bet i know why. but anyway. i decided that on the days i have weight training i'm going to come home and run that night, and on the days i don't i will go to the gym. (when i don't work at least) running inside is SO much easier. i could run miles inside. but if i try and do that outside it's so much harder because of breathing the outside air. i hate running in the cold. well that's my plan and i'm pretty excited actually. hopefully by the time track comes i will be pretty good. :) i finally finished my page today for the paper. that thing was a pain. but it looks good now. page 14, check it out. :) hehe.

"event","i stayed after school one day last week to run and work out. i was sore the next day, so that's definitely a good thing. it was the kind of pain that feels good. my legs hurt more than they ever did when i would work out with Bruce. i wasn't going to stay after..but 2 out of 3 always wins! hehe. ;) so Shelby and i realized that when we talk about guys we are always referring to certain people. (even though we make it sound like we are referring to guys in general) so we my as well just include their names and state the obvious, like we do with every other thing.
okay, so friday night Holley and i went to outback for dinner. yumm. our waitress was a lil crazy, she kept our change! and she was a spaz... but the food was really good, like always. we planned on seeing ""saw"" and i was so excited that i would get to buy my own movie ticket (yeah, lame i know, but it was going to be great) but i ended up forgetting my ID at home. so we saw ""the grudge"" because they were checking tickets. it was kind of stupid, but i liked it. we freaked ourselves out so that made it better. :) and i saw Jenni after the movie standing outside the mall. i got to meet her boyfriend, Brian. it reminded me of last year when me and Jenni would walk around every day during lunch and talk. she would tell me so much about Brian, and now he's her boyfriend so i'm really happy for her. 
Holley and i thought we were going to get kidnapped in the parking lot so we ran almost the whole way. vans are scary! she had to be home so i dropped her off and went to play pool with Shaun. and i beat him the first game!!! let it be known, too. it was very exciting for me. haha. then of course i lost the next game, but that's SO not important. i worked saturday 8:30-4. it was actually fun. and i got a lot of hours so i'm happy. i really like all the people i work with. then Holley and i decided against going out for the night and stayed at home and watched a movie. 
so today i got new furniture in my room. it's actually old furniture, it used to be my cousin's.. but it's new to me and i like it a lot better. it was a pain to move everything out and thne back in. grrr. i have something with a lot of people in my room like that. it bothers me. but now my room looks better now so i'm happy. 
Holley and i got A's for last night. actually i think we deserve A+'s... hehe. that was very good of us, i think. now if i can just keep that up things should be better in no time. :)
lol.. Pita."

""AHHH Holley!!! your gums are on my hand!!""

Holley spent the week with me and it was a lot of fun. the most important thing was, of course, our tie tying lesson. we went to my neighbor Al's house and he brought out racks of ties for us to go through, and Kenny taught us how to tie them so we are officially pros. it made everyone's night. haha. monday- pajama day. no one actually sleeps in the clothes they wore to school that day but it was a good excuse to be comfortable all day. :) tuesday was western day and wednesday was catholic school girl day, which i find funny because some schools always wear those clothes, and they hate it, yet we have a special day to wear them. it's basically slut day. my mom made me and Holley's lunches all week.. it was so cute, she wrote things on our bags and everything. i felt like i was back in elementry school. hehe. friday was the best day i had all week, actually the best day i've had in a while. 75% of the reason was because it was spirit day, pep rally, and the homecoming game. we lost the game but we still played good. the game was so much fun. i love football games. but i don't love the cops that won't let you back to your seat in the bleachers. okay, i usually understand the things that cops do.. but not letting me back to my seat, where my purse was, really pissed me off. i got to the game 30 minutes early to see Amanda lead the color guard and Shelby dance... i leave to go get Holley and i can't come back? so... someone goes to the concession stand for a drink and aren't allowed to come back to their seat? wth. i was so pissed.. and it takes a lot to get me that mad... i was arguing with the stupid cops, then i just left. finally they let us up there, i gave that lady cop the worst look.. gosh, i was so mad. lol. but everything else was really great. hah, then a group of us met in the senior lot so we could drive together to get food... had some fun in the parking lot. hehe. did a few laps.. :) we then all drove to steak and shake, to blockbuster (and saw Charlie!!! and got discounts on candy and got a FREE movie!!), then had a SLEEPOVER! it was so exciting.. i haven't been to an actual sleepover in soo long. store meeting- freakin' 8am this morning!!! today is the FLORIDA GEORGIA GAME! Go Gators. :)"

"event","friday night Holley and i went to the Episcopal game against us... we ended up only seeing a few minutes of it because we got so lost... let's just say we ended up 17 miles from Jacksonville, leave it to us! we did figure out things were wrong sooner than that but there wasn't an exit for like ten minutes... anyways, Paxon killed Episcopal, 26-0. we saw David.. i haven't seen him in soo long! saturday i got up and went to BK for districts... got lost again..lol. i'm no good with that area. but luckily someone called me and helped me out, good thing. girl's didn't make it to regionals, but i was so excited. i got my best time yet!! :) less than thirty minutes.. that was my goal. now i think my goal will be 26 minutes. i want to get good eventually, i'm willing to try and work at it so i can be decent for track. then of course for the rest of the day Holley, Francesca, and I did girl things. we got our nails done, did hair and make up and all that good stuff. it was really fun. we all got ready at Holley's house and took pictures and everything. dinner was really nice, we went out with a group of people to the landing. it was freezing though, but it was a lot of fun. my legs were killing me at the dance, after already running that morning then dancing, but it was well worth it. David L., that kid can really dance. that was fun. then i went to Shaun's for the night, which was also a lot of fun. :) sunday was me and Holley's sleep day. we slept the majority of the day and went to target and stuff... my mom knows everything, it's official.. ""when'd you guys get home, 8am?""... ahh whaatt!! that's just a little freaky!! well Holley is staying with me for a whole week, i'm really excited. :)"

anyways... i stayed after for cross country twice this week. tuesday was hard for me... but i did everything, and that's all that matters right now. i'm proud of myself that i at least try at something. even though i'm not too great... today we did nothing. we walked around the school and talked. and i visited Mama Holmes!!! 
i am soo excited about homecoming, we made reservations and everything for dinner. :) Eric asked me to go to my homecoming with him, which i definitely wanted to and we would have had a lot of fun,. but he's going out of town this weekend. :( but i'm going with a group of friends, which will still be a lot of fun. so i'm really excited. plus dressing up is the best. hehe. i've been driving my mom's truck to school all week.. that thing is a beast. and it cost pver THIRTY dollars to fill it up.. that's freakin insane! if my car took that much i would rarely leave the house. i'd probably ride the bus. but i finally got my car back today!! it's only been in the shop three times, maybe four, in the past 2-3 months.. brakes, cluth, gears, transmission, gears again. grrr.
yesterday was a ""half day"" so Holley and i went to Moe's for lunch, it's becoming a tradition. we saw Barrett!!! our friend was middle school, it was so exciting. he looks a lot different, not face wise, but he's grown up a lot.i was just like wow.. Barrett... haha. 
i'm just a little tired of people causing a lot of drama.. when will people learn to EXPECT things? but they don't and everyone freaks out... but, you know, i wouldn't understand because i've NEVER been through anything so horrible, my life is obviously just perfect, isn't it, so who am i to talk?"

Holley's changed. Francesca's definitely changed. and, well.. Shelby and I.. ours haven't changed. which isn't at all shocking. :/ but guess who came to visit us when we were in the drive thru?! larry and michael!! :) well Ricky called us and he said he was at famous amos in a booth by himself because he thought we were coming, so we felt really bad. we ended up meeting up with him again and hanging out for a while. Holley's gay dog was pretty entertaining... it really was. lol. i'm glad Francesca had a good birthday. :) my car is pissing me off, it's so hard to get into gear so i have to sit there forever trying to get it in... grrr. so it has to go get fixed again or something, i don't know. makes me mad. they keep taking my car away from me. my mom got back into town today, and im really glad. i missed her. 
shelby, i really love talking to you about 'what we were talking about' on the way to your car tonight. makes me feel soo much better... like, wow, someone really does understand me, and for once i don't feel stupid for saying things out loud, because you know exactly what i mean. and i love how our taste in guys is completely opposite. the guys i find attractive aren't at all attractive to you, and vice versa. so it works out really good for us, and well, it always has. hehe. so that's my 'i love shelby' note of the day.

""i won!!!"" haha. i love hanging out with them. ""raise your hand if you think guys are assholes"" yeah.. all the girls raised their hands.. kind of interesting. 
and saturday we went to wild adventures!! it was a lot of fun! so we go in the park for a while.. then we go out to the car and we end up sitting in the car talking and eating snacks for 2 hours.. lol. who sits in the car in the parking lot of wild adventures? and guys think that the stuff they talk about is worse than the stuff girls talk about... well they have NO idea. we went into 2 haunted houses. the first one we walked out and fell onto the ground. it was so scary though. Shelby turns around and starts hitting the guy that's chasing us in the house, we are trying to run out but we couldn't run because we were all holding onto each other. in the second haunted house we lost Thelma.

""your not scary!!!"" -thelma
""arggggggggghhh"" -ghost
""your not scary!!! shut up, i'm looking for my shoe!!!"" -thelma
""oh, sorry"" -ghost
we were so scared, we thought she died, so when she came out we tackled her. Shelby almost got cut up by a chainsaw. and i was sitting next to some random guy on the terror train and i was about on his lap. the freakin' jason guy (or whatever he was..) kept walking by and freaking me out. the scariest part is those people walking around and following you, and holding chainsaws!! we got taco bell and wendy's on the way home. we went through the wendy's drive thru twice. man, the guys in there were hot. so went through again and got free frosty's and ketchup. haha. ""frostys and ketchup.. are you sure that's all you want...?"" and i definitely drove the whole way home... sucked big time. especially since everyone else attempted to sleep and i was left fighting to stay awake. my eyes closed so many times and i'd open them real fast. it was scary, and so hard to stay awake. not to mention, i was burning up in the car but they we're cold. the heat makes you even more tired, and when its on FULL blast theres no way you can make it not blow into your eyes, which only dried my contacts out even more. i was SO pissed. i'm all for equalling out driving time, because trust me i was just as tired and felt just as bad. but.. it's fine. i was just pissed at the time, it's so dangerous too. that's what i was worried about. i kept dozing off and jumping back awake. it was really scary. but we made it, thank God. 
okay.. my cousin wants me to call this guy and tell him ""Maddie can't call you right now..but she's pregnant."" what the hell? i am NOT going to do that. he may be a jerk, but that's not something to joke around with. i may not be able to stand the guy, but that's harsh. she thinks it's some game... if it was some little joke i'd do it.. but that's serious. and she doesn't understand that. why would you want to put the guy you ""love"" through that? grrr."

it's really aggravating when people can sit here and say they don't like bush because of the war and say that they are so against the war. i know everyone won't ever agree, and people are going to have different beliefs, but at least show the troops some support. i know that if i were a soldier fighting in Iraq right now, and i heard that people (the people that i was fighting for) in my country were angry, or mad, at the president for sending me over there, i'd be pretty hurt. if the people you are fighting for can't even be happy, what's the point of fighting for them? (or really their name) show some respect. even though i don't like Kerry, if he wins the election, i'll still respect him. get over it- there is a war, our troops are there, and there isn't anything you can do about it. so sit here and protest against it (when nothing is going to change) or support the troops (because they are there, and they will stay there, whether you like it or not)? what makes more sense? just show the troops that you respect them for what their doing, and give them some support. after all, it's their job, and they obviously want to do this, seeing that they were not FORCED to go into the military. it makes me really mad when people are like ""gosh i hate bush! my friend just signed up for the marines and he's going to Iraq in six months!!"" and it's really funny when the friend that they are talking about is like ""i know i just signed up, but i didn't think i'd get sent!!"" we're in the middle of a war... damn, what do they expect. did he actually believe he could sign up in the middle of a war and not get sent? wow... maybe he shouldn't go. that's not too bright if you ask me.

""i don't want girl's getting pregnant"" okay, mom, look who your talking to. enough said. ""your not allowed in a hotel room unless there is someone 18 or older there"" what.. does she think they come door to door and check. umm NO. ""everyone is going to hear about it and show up"" well, okay, this is a good point. BUT we aren't going to spend most of our time in the room, mainly just to sleep. we will be doing other things.. like walking down to the beach or going to the pool/jacuzzi, whatever. we aren't going to let random people we barely know come spend the night in the room with us. who does she think we are? and that's all her arguments. yeah, so let's suggest an idea that our daughters would never even ask to do in the first place, tell them they can do it, get their hopes up, THEN come back a week before the day and tell them NO. smooth...."

"event","yesterday was my birthday. :) so now i can buy rated R movie tickets and i have a one o clock curfew, sometimes. my mom still isn't letting me stay out that late every night. just this weekend. so.. school was just okay yesterday. shelby brought me the biggest balloon and her mom made me my favorite cookies. :) yummm. i just wasn't in a good mood yesterday at school. i have my reasons. i think most of it has to do with a talk i had with a friend thrusday night, so i had a lot on my mind, and a lot to think about. i guess i came off as being ""mad"", but i wasn't mad. if i could tell YOU what i mean, then you would understand, i think. but the day was still pretty good. Holley came home with me and we picked up Francesca on the way to my house. we went to Clark's fishcamp for dinner. it was really good. (and i didn't get chicken fingers, yes!! lol) we tried some ""cock fritters"".. haha CONCH fritters. my mom said she'd give us each five dollars if we ate it, Holley and i did. Francesca didn't make it, but i don't blame her, she thought they were ""cock"" fritters, not conch fritters, so i would have probably spit it out too. lol. that was great. and it was so disgusting. yuck... man, we laughed so much. and we laugh over nothing. ""ABOUT TIME!!!!"" hahaha. then we went to see Ladder 49. i loved that movie, (not just because i'm in love with firefighters, that's only part of the reason) but it was a really good movie. it had everything in it. and now i;m even MORE in love with firefighters. i'm going to marry one, i just know it. then we went to a friends house. and stayed there for a little while. i was going to meet up with Eric, but we didn't get to because we were still in the movie. :( Last night was a lot of fun. we still have to go through the McDonald's drive thru... we didn't get a chance. but we will.. we have to ""see what's changed."" but i can tell you three right now that mine hasn't. which is a little sad, but what can i say? 
cross country meet this morning at 8. the girls' didn't even have a team, we only had four people. it took me 31 minutes, i was pissed. that's a minute longer than i usually do. it felt really good though after i was done. and the course wasn't too bad. :)"

"event","Happy Birthday Eric!! (sept 28th)

first of all, i'm so excited that Francesca gets to go to New York. that is so awesome. :) and i'm working on getting her a job at Hallmark with me, so i hope she gets it! i want to go to New York so bad. so bad. i guess Francesca and I kinda have a plan for our birthday.. our parents are going to let us rent a hotel on the beach. wow, what are they thinking? lol.. that's even worse than what we wanted to do- go to hanna park. maybe this is a better idea... something new. hanna park brings back memories. i haven't had cable for almost a week because of the hurricane. grrr. so that means i haven't been able to write in almost a week. i went and saw The Forgotten last night. it would have been good, but the end was bad. there were so many good possibilities for the ending and not one of them that actually made sense happened. not what i expected. but it wasn't bad. the best part was seeing the people fly into the sky, that was awesome. i had to do my whole math project tonight... i was so stressed about it too. but i got most of it done, thank goodness. i need to go to bed...."

"event","Right, so I've completely neglected LJ, as well as almost every other online community that I belong to, for the past few months. I am alive, interesting things have happened, it's just that this summer has been the best one of my adult life, and so it has flown by. I have tried to make everyone that is important to me be apart of it, so if you weren't it's either because you aren't as important as you thought or you live too far away from me to make anything work (if that's the case, I am sad). Anyway, there shall be two posts to come in the very near future. The first will sort of sum up most of my summer, end of school, blah blah blah, and the second will describe my Labor Day weekend, and will be probably just as long if not longer than the first. I will try to remember everything I can and gather up pictures as soon as I can so that I can make these two posts. Keep in mind that I also have probably about a thousand friend entries to read as well, so be patient, because these posts will be worth the wait (if you don't agree with me, you suck). 

Oh, one last thing, after this post, my journal will be ""friends only"" so you're gonna have to get me to add you to view anything of substance."

"event","I was just now looking over the document my AI teacher posted, which shows the grades for everyone in the class right before the drop date, again, and more closely this time. The grades in the class are completely based on a curve, broken up into approximate percentages for each grade (i.e. top 10%, next 15%, etc.). At the time the document was made, there were 5 people doing worse than me out of 42, which guaranteed me a C (I'm only doing this bad because of a mishap a number of weeks back that caused me to miss turning in two assignments). But as I looked closer, I saw that the two lowest scores hadn't done anything since the first assignment (including the midterm), so basically, three or four of the five doing worse than me are probable drops, the remaining one or two below me, as well as the three right above me, are possible drops. This means that I would have to move up the ladder by like seven people to get a C, unless some of the people didn't drop or some people bomb the final, or the scores of the people who dropped still count (which is unlikely). So basically, no matter what, I'm probably fucked for this class, unless I ace the final, and the teacher says ""well he sucked ass at the hw, but his test scores are good, so i'll let him pass"", or some people were stupid enough not to drop the class when they should have (i.e. the probable or possible drops i mentioned earlier).

I think I shall cry now."

"event","So far, my spring break has consisted of having to reinstall windows on my computer, going to work, getting my glasses adjusted (which i had to wait almost an hour to have done), a little bit of nothing, and my mom asking me if i had two girlfriends and if i had had sex yet (both within two minutes of each other). What's to come? I have to catch up with schoolwork for all of my classes so that i can try not to fail any of them so i can graduate and be fucking done with school, at least for a while, more work, more work on my computer, a concert (possibly two) and easter with my mom's side of the family (which will be lame). There shall probably be no pictures from my spring break, since i am not really doing anything picture worthy all week, so don't hold your breath.

Anyways, I think i need to stop watching shows and movies, since there is a lot things that i want to do coming up before school's end, apart from schoolwork and studying, that i want to accomplish or go to. I decided that maybe if i made a list and posted it, then i'd have a better chance of accomplishing the things on the list because others would know about them.&nbsp; so here goes:

Louis C.K. at the Acme comedy club on May 5
The world's largest trivia competition the weekend of April 20
Tubring in Chicago on April 27
ACen the weekend of before my finals (The weekend of May 13 i think)
start work on a card game program
exercise, since i am lazy and starting to feel like shit all the time
be able to do more things for costuming, with my focus starting on making props

so yeah, if anyone is going to ACen, and i know there are a few of you out there, and would either be able to hook me up with a ride or a room on the off chance that i can make it, let me know.

oh, and assuming that i graduate this semester, there will be a graduation party (at my parents' house i assume?) so anyone that would be interested in coming to it should let me know and let me know when they would be able to make it (or when they couldn't make it) so that i can figure out a day that works for all (or most if not).

words of encouragement are welcome too, since i think i'm going to go crazy some time before this semester ends.

oh, before i forget, i want to get a tokyo mew mew group together, possibly for ohayocon or somewhere thereabouts, i would be ichiro, and need people for the four others. I want to do it really well and go all out for it, so anyone that is either interested themselves or know of someone who is, let me know so i can start getting shit figured out."

"event","So last night was my birthday party. I was a combo party, since my birthday and two of my friends birthdays are within 5.25 days of each other (if you average in leap years). It marked the second celebration of my birthday, with the first being last Sunday (sadly, there wasn't one on my actual birthday), third being today, and the fourth/last being next weekend. The odd numbered ones are family shit, so kinda lame, apart from the free food, but last night was pretty sweet, and next week should be too. I will make a better post when I get some more time and actually upload pictures, and at that time I'll go into the details of the roommate dickfest that happened there, and how I ended up leaving my own party."

"event","My huge adventure started by me going up to Minneapolis for what I thought was only going to be for the weekend. I got up to Ash's and Anna's place on Friday sometime and not really much happened that night. Saturday morning I had to run errands for the VD party while the girls were at work, which was probably about the most productive I was all weekend. I had tried to use my van to take Anna to work early in the morning but it would not start. I thought that it was just because it was so cold and needed to warm up (you'll find out in a little while how wrong I was). So after errands, I did schoolwork and shit until Anna got home,she started working on my costume and we started cleaning up/decorating for the party. Ash ended up getting home way earlier than she thought since she and the other workers under her kicked ass and powered their way through all the work they had to do, so she was able to get home and change before anyone showed up. Both of the gals looked stunning in their dresses, and I didn't look too bad in my suit. (I apologize if some of the pictures have already been shared on here).<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/0000b3w1/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/0000b3w1/s320x240"" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/0000c5kw/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/0000c5kw/s320x240"" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/0000dgky/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/0000dgky/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />Anna hurt her knee at one point and describes how to me in this video:<br /><br /><img src=""file:///F:/Pictures/Events/Long%20Ass%20Bad%20Weekend/Vday%20party/DSC04935.JPG"" alt="""" /><a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=t0tknVGBIyk"">Hurt knee explaination</a><br /><br />The party went decently until the end of it, when there was some drama and an all around not so good time. I didn't notice something that was going on until it was too late and totally made myself out to be an ass because of it, but that's about all that I'm going to elaborate on that. I awoke Sunday to try to jump my car to see if I could get it going without any luck. Long, LONG story short, I had to stick around until Wednesday afternoon for the van to get fixed and then tried to take it home, got just into Wisconsin when it died again, and then Ash, bless her heart, spent her Valentine's Day coming to get me from the gas station that I was stranded at, and bring me back to her house so I could get ahold of my parents and have one of them pick me up so I wouldn't miss an entire week of school and so I could unpack and repack for Katsucon. <br /><br />I was in Madison less than 24 hours before I had to depart for Washington D.C. for Katsucon. The trip was pretty uneventful, apart from calling Anna while I was walking to the bus and pissing the hell out of Ash. I believe that a good time was had by all at Katsucon (aside from Hayley - we're gonna make sure that doesn't happen again!). Friday night, we wore our costumes for a bit, but it was boring, so we went out to dinner for Rob's 21st birthday. I was way too tired, having been up for over two days straight, and the girls got too drunk to party too late that night, so we ended up crashing at like 9 pm (lame, I know). Though at one point on Friday night I poured beer in Anna's ass crack, because I told her I would if I could see it again, and the next time I turned around, there it was. Saturday was filled with Disgaea 2; finishing costumes, getting dressed, photoshoots, ice, and then finally getting drunk.&nbsp; Caleb and I at one point locked the girls in the bathroom by moving a chest thing in front of the door, and Anna tried to move it without great success (hahaha, get it?) <br /><br /><a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=si80g3fEreA"">Stuck Behind A Closet</a><br /><br />There was also random meeting up with almost everyone that we wanted to see, and Also a mustache party! All of the pictures of the mustache party have been posted so I won't post them at this time, unless there are a lot of people that haven't seen them. Somewhere that night, Hayley ""poked"" Anna (to keep it clean) and I got a video of their reaction of the experience.<br /><a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=68sHAt1Kt5c""><br />Hayley's / Anna's reaction to ""the poke""</a><br /><br />The Atl gang had to leave right away when we woke up, and the two Mpls gals and I stuck around for a bit, visiting the dealers' room, before heading to the airport. I had basically an uneventful trip home, though the flight was annoying as shit because there were two 8th grade D.C. trips returning with me. I got back to Madison Monday morning at 2 am and right as I got off the bus Ash called me (amazing timing if you ask me) and told me all about their Kentucky adventures as I walked home and then spent the rest of the morning studying for a test (which I probably failed).<br /><br /><a href=""http://s75.photobucket.com/albums/i300/MagicHentaiClub/Katsucon%202007/?start=all"">The rest of my pics from the con are here</a>"

"event","As it happens, I went up to where I work right after making the last post to find that the place where I work is closed today. Go figure. This is probably a good thing, since I have a lot of stuff that I didn't get done this weekend that I should do before tomorrow. <br /><br />Anyways, about the two new holes. I got my nipples pierced on Saturday night, and it was acutally kind of an adventure. I was brewing beer with two of my friends most of the day and then was going to pick my sister up from work since I was in town. I thought I was supposed to be there at 10, but it turns out that it was 10:30, so yeah, that's kinda irrelevant to the story, besides the fact that my sister went with me when I got 'em done. When she got done with work, I asked her if she wanted to go with me, and she did so we went together. Hooray! <br /><br />I had a coupon for the place I go to get my piercings (Public Enemy in Sun Prairie) as well as some jewelry, so it only cost me $40 for the whole process. The first one went off without a hitch, with pain similar to that of my lip piercings. The second one hurt quite a bit more, and then even more when she put the horseshoe in (apparently the threading on the horseshoes I have are a bitch, and they're not gonna get changed for at least 12 weeks). I felt a little light headed when it was done and I sat up, but I still felt okay.  I got up to look at them in the mirror and I started to feel tingly, so I started taking deep breaths, and I felt better. <br /><br />And then I woke up on the floor. <br /><br />I fainted for a second, and freaked the shit out of my sister. She thought that I was having a seizure or something. I kept assuring her that I was fine, and sat for a few minutes with a sucker and a glass of water. I am quite fine, but I guess I am just prone to fainting when I get pierced (it also happened the first time I got pierced, so i'm at about 1/4 of the time).<br /><br />Yup, that's about it, except that when Anna found out, she was a real bitch about it.<br /><br />Here's some pictures:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/00008w65/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/00008w65/s320x240"" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/00009580/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/00009580/s320x240"" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/0000a3q6/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/magichentaiclub/pic/0000a3q6/s320x240"" /></a>"

"event","So finals are done for me now, and I learned something important this semester: if all of the material for the course is only covered in class, you should probably go to class more than never. 

Anyway, I have designed some christmas cards for a couple of people (if i designed one for you, you probably know it) and now just need to get my lazy ass to make them. 

Anyone else that would be interested in one that I will see anytime soon, let me know. But I should mention that they are not your typical christmas cards. (If you know me at all, you know what I mean).

I will post pictures of them after they are given, and other winter break type pictures as they come up. 

On that note, I have a holiday lunch for work to go to at famous dave's, followed by more free food at my other job, and then drinks with those peoples from work, drinking the beer that i brewed for the first time, and possibly more drinking at the come back inn. (I'm not an alcoholic, i swear).

Sadly, there was a nice holiday dinner that i could have attended for the second job, but it is the saturday of Ohayo, so those of you who will be at ohayo, we're gonna have to make up for that!

Well, i had better head out, since we will be meeting for lunch in like 9 minutes."

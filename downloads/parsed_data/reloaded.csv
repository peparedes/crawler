So I went out with one of my ladies yesterday to the girls-only party they're throwing at the ""zakk"".
We'd only just arrived and made our way to the dancefloor, taking in the scenery, when during the second song I feel someone brushing up close behind me. Didn't think much of it, as it was crowded and people move past you all the time. So I take a step forward to make room for the girl to pass me by, but suddenly she's grinding up against me and hands begin exploring my hips and the surrounding area. Dude. *lol*
My first thought was: ""I haven't been here 10 minutes, gimme a break."" And then I was trying to think of a nice way to get out of the situation, as I only wanted to dance that night and wasn't looking. I turn around and--
Petra's standing before me, grinning like a loon!
I'd only just met the girl on Tuesday. She studies media design with a very good friend of mine (Kat), so we hung out for a while. I'd even met her shortly again yesterday in the city, when I met up with Kat to do some shopping, and then <i>yet again</i> at the party. 
We had a good laugh and promised to hit the club together again next month. I bet we can get Kat to come along! *grins*

I've also been told I've been hit on several times that night, but I was completely oblivious to any flirting. The music was too good, I guess... *snickers* Maybe next time. ;)"

"event","I was bashing a fic the other day (""Letting Go""), to which Muffin left me a comment. Instead of just replying to that, I wanted to dedicate an entire post to this to set some things straight.

I'm aware of the fact that it seemed I was only bashing the fic because of its OFC. However, though ""Letting Go"" gives us a rather extreme case of a Mary Sue, it was not the reason why I singled it out.

I began writing fan fiction when I was 12. Long story short: <i>of course</i> I'm guilty of writing Mary Sues myself in the past. I was young and in love with Joe McIntyre! ;) 
I've stumbled upon many so-called Mary Sues in the LOTR fandom since then (even male versions - what are those called, btw?), which is ok. They can be incorporated into intriguing plotlines, well-written stories. I'm on lotr_het even, so I clearly enjoy my piece of het fiction from time to time. Thus a female character is no reason for me to dislike a story, but rather to give it a chance. 
I'd love to see more females in slash stories (not femslash, but starring the guys) anyway: as best friends, make-up artists, waiters, barkeepers, neighbors - <i>whatever</i>. There are females in MY world, not just gay man (or worse, an <i>entirely</i> gay LOTR cast, which I've sadly seen as well), so please let me read about some. Just adds to the realism, you know?!

But it's one thing to create an OFC that's the perfect version of yourself in a nice story and another to write a badly written fic, starring a rather extreme Mary Sue even. So what I was bashing was the author's style far more than her OFC. I didn't take the time to explain that clearly, I know. 

Muffin thinks it was at least courageous to post ""Letting Go"" - and I agree. The author probably is a teen now (who will mature in time) among older authors in a harsh slash world. People like me come along and laugh at her work, when she might write excellent stuff some day, who knows. BUT what I can ask of any author at any age is to at least do some research to get the names of actors right.

Hope that clears things up. :)"

<lj-cut text=""Elijah"">
ELIJAH

He spread his arms like wings, feeling the wind tug at his clothes and the spray of the sea on his exposed skin, before his feet carried him off on their own accord. Elijah ran. No destination, no chase, no chains.
Faster and faster, until his feet were barely touching ground, until all he could feel was the air in his lungs, all he could taste the salt on his lips. He was tall, strong and vibrant. He was a different man. Blue eyes closed to a play of sunlight on black canvas as he neared the cliff, ready to jump, ready to soar, ready for the freedom of--

""Lighe? Where are you, mate?""

The world changed before his eyes too suddenly. The wind tugging at him were Dom's fingers on his shirt, the rush in his ears Dom's voice, the sun in his eyes were mere flashlights of unwelcomed cameras. The sand beneath his feet was bleeding into a thin, red carpet. Though he was sure his eyes were a mirror of crying skies, Elijah found his trademark smile still on display.

""Ready?""

Yeah, Elijah thought. He let his smile falter.
""Yeah"", he said and walked away.

Ready for the freedom of being anywhere but here.

THE END</lj-cut>

By the way, this isn't suicidal Elijah. Quite the opposite, actually.
Oh, and should you think this worthy or in need of a comment/criticism, be honest. I don't have a beta, so anything will help."

There's bad fiction, and then there's bad fiction. They're not the same my friends, oh no.
Some of the stories are so godawful that they're actually funny. We've had an example of that yesterday.
But other stories are just plain awful. In case you'd like to know what I mean, would you please go to LOTR_RPS and read ""There's An Elf In My Bed"" or the follow-up ""There's A Rent Boy In My Bed"" (talk about creativity).
Hellooooo? Can we say bloody unrealistic dialogue and unbelievable action?
First of all, I've never heard anybody talk the way that Viggo and Orli do in this fic. And didn't you just guess before that this <i>had</i> to be a Viggorli-story...
Second, like hell am I not gonna be aware of somebody walking in on me masturbating (""ranger"" abilities or not) or weighing down the mattress I lay on, fer fuck's sake. To quote from one of my all-time favorite movies (<i>Singing In The Rain</i>): ""Do you think I'm dumb or something?!""

I don't mean whether they do it for the money, the entertainment, the praise or the satisfaction, but rather....what do they think writing a story is for. Simply telling a story to entertain? Or to actually tell a story that is worth telling?

More often than not I read fics on the lists that make me go ""Huh?"". 
Not only because they're written in poor style or grammar, but because there's nothing to it. No sense, no reason. It's not even provoking emotion. 
Just a random scene or wanna-be angsty piece, a fracture of a story at best. (Now I'm not talking about drabbles here. It's not about the length of a fic, 'cause drabbles sure tell powerful stories when they are well written.) Most likely some fangirls day-dream that she feels is so good she needs to share it. Why thank you, babes, but I have a mind and fantasy of my own.

The reason that at the moment I feel I have no good story to tell is why I've stopped writing fiction all these months ago. Because why else would I write, if not because I felt I had something to say, an issue to address or some beauty/pain/problem to capture?
And so, sometimes I wonder what other people write for.

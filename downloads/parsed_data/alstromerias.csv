Leaving The May means leaving behind the home I shared with our four legged family. I will not have memories of Sammy bear or P kitty in this new place.  

The living room is full of boxes, and getting it all organized and put away once school starts seems a daunting task.  And we need to get ready for baby.  I've been refusing to think about furniture for baby, but I can't keep that up.  So much to buy.

Someone, somewhere said that having kids means being stronger than you ever knew you could be.  Accomplishing everything I need to this term is going to require that I be stronger than I ever knew I could be.  Check back in ten weeks, we'll see how it went...

Ten weeks later (this was draft was auto saved by LJ) - The term went well.  All ""A""s again.  And it wasn't event too difficult of a term. Although, organizing the house is only just now happening.  There is still some stuff in boxes.  We bought bookshelves today, so maybe I'll get those boxes emptied tomorrow."

But really, he enetered into a psychological battle with a manager.  Alhtough he succeded at make an ass of the manager, and I suppose mentally bested him, it was a lose/lose style of conflict resolution.  Alex doesn't have a job, and Papa Hayden will face state/insurance investigations of employment practices.

He filed a complaint with OSHA, and he's talking about suing for wrongful termination.  I wish I could make him stop. (Although it looks like he has a case, I'm not sure that the size of his salary makes it worth pursuing, not to mention the emotional drain of it all.  This can't be a time to move on to new opportunities if it is spent stuck fighting in the past with a law suit.)

It's hard not to think that if the women had been around, this would not have happened.   John and Alex exploded on the same weekend that the female general manager was out of town, and I was out of town.  If Alex could have talked to Molly or me, maybe it would have all gone very differently.  I can't believe they fired him.  The situation is trully absurd."

Made it to the post office with a thank you gift for Pap Pap
Took a killer bilogy midterm
Met with the new garden coordinator
Finished most of my math homework

And now I'm really looking forward to a beer."

"event","It is absolutely beautiful out.  And now we have a term for this deceiving late winter sunshine.  We will not be fooled, the rain will be back.

In other news, I'm planning our first party in almost a year (we haven't entertained since the Hallway Party of June 08).  We're gonna have a housewarming, because we kinda like our new place.  Oh yeah.  But not till the term is over because it is a doozy.  

Now, off to go memorize me some biology."

In the room across the hall- he has terminal cancer and is ready to go, but as he complained angrily to his daughter his wife just wont let him.

I use to wonder about the term bittersweet, but that describes my trip to PA, so sad and so good.  She slept through my last visit to her room.  I wonder if that will be the last I see of her?  I wish I was better at talking about it all with Pap Pap."

"event","So it just occured to me that President elect Obama will be innagurated the day after we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr Day.  It's funny how things flow together.

Also, we watched the new Cat Williams comedy special last night, and loved it.  He talks about putting his seven year old son on ritalin, it is brilliant.  He does not stay on the drug for long.  

And as a white girl, I really ought not to be saying pimpin'."

"event","This term I have the busiest schedule I've maintained since probably high school.  I've sadly had to cut back on the ganja because I just don't have time for it.  I always suspected quitting would come on as a surprise when it simply no longer fit my lifestyle.  Although I can see myself heading that way, I have not arrived yet.  It's getting closer and closer to being time to cut the dreads."

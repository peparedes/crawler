"event","A. Pick 20 of your favorite movies.
B. Then pick one of your favorite quotes from each movie.
C. Post the quotes in your journal.
D. Have those on your friends list to guess what the movie is.
E. Strike out the quote once it has been correctly identified and place the guesser's user name directly after the quote

1. Hello, I'm nice, he's nice, we're both fucking lunatics. Can I come in, please?
2. If real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain
3. If anyone finds this, it means my plan didn't work and I'm already dead. But if I can somehow go back to the beginning of all of this, I might be able to save her. 
4. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves
5. Fine. Have it your way! 'Cause this is where your land of fiction is always right: we win. End of story! 
6. Did you ever find Bugs Bunny attractive when he put on a dress and played girl bunny?
7.<b> You'll shoot your eye out, kid. </b> Andrew
8. Where do you want to be oiled first? 
9. Something is always happening, but when it happens, people don't always see it, or understand it, or accept it.
10. <b> This is where they fought the battle of Gettysburg. Fifty thousand men died right here on this field, fighting the same fight that we are still fighting among ourselves today. This green field right here, painted red, bubblin' with the blood of young boys. Smoke and hot lead pouring right through their bodies. Listen to their souls, men. I killed my brother with malice in my heart. Hatred destroyed my family. You listen, and you take a lesson from the dead. If we don't come together right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed, just like they were. I don't care if you like each other of not, but you will respect each other. And maybe... I don't know, maybe we'll learn to play this game like men </b> Andrew again
11. Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore
12. Just when I thought you couldn't get any dumber, you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourself!
13. You were right Johnny, you can't win no matter what you do!
14. Like a beautiful blonde pineapple!
15. A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men. 
16.<b> I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate it, I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it that you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you. Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all </b> Daniel
17. Dude, is my face okay? I think you melted it off
18. Dad, I'm a lesbian. A big one
19. Keep it secret. Keep it safe
20. Inside me I'm screaming, nobody pays any attention. If I had arms, I could kill myself. If I had legs, I could run away. If I had a voice, I could talk and be some kind of company for myself. I could yell for help, but nobody would help me."

1. Have a biological child
2. Get married
3. Write a book
4. Get my doctorate
5. Move out
6. Drive

15. Get a monkey
16. See the Smithsonian
17. Some how let John Rzeznik know he inspired me so much

"event","So left my house after about 20 mins of my mom telling us not to get pulled over lol. Got to Chris' about 6:30 and had to wait in the lobby for Chris to sign me in, which is a little weird if you've never done it b4. So called him on the cell and he didn't answer, so they had to go get him lol, came down with bleach blonde hair lol. It was hot though lol. So got in his dorm and there were a few ppl there already, one who was already pretty lit lol. Me and sis had to stay in there with her while Chris signed some other ppl in, was a little odd. So started drinking a little Bullfrog, which doesn't taste that bad, but apparently was chocked full of Vodka. Drank half cup of that, and stopped for a bit. So then it was me, Chris, the lit girl, and another girl who I knew from one of my classes. He started playing really bad 80's music and they were doing interprative dance and singing in the hall way. Then he starts playing ""It's Raining Men"" really load and they were dancing in the hall. He and I kept looking at each other and giggling at them, cause I was not making a fool of myself lol. Got myself a Zima and started on that, some other guys wondered into the hall and were looking in the door, I knew I was starting to feel something cause I was fliritng with one lol. His name was Ben, although then he started flirting with my sister LOL ROTFLOL. At one point was in the dorm with 4 guys, although Jesse stole their attention, he's such a little whore lol. FINALLY, got some pizza, and I was happy for that cause I was starting to feel buzzed, so I tried to eat a small piece, but I sort of got sick, so I had to stop. Started drinking a little bit more Zima, and then we were listening to some weird folk music. Maria B. walked it (Ben's Gf!) and I was sooooo happy to see her because I haven't seen her forever and cause I only really knew Chris. So by the time I had drank that bullfrog and the 3/4 Zima, I was buzzed. I started having trouble understanding what ppl were asking me, and was singing and giggling. I thought I was drunk actually, but I could still read and I knew what was going on lol. I got a piece of gum and couldn't open the wrapper lol. So I stopped completely. They invited me to some place called Phase 2, but I knew if I went I would get drunk, and I didn't know if it was a rough spot or not. So we went on home. I think my sister told my mom about the Zima, but not about the Vodka. She said she didn't say anything about it. I really hope I can go again and hang with them I had a good time. And Chris was sweet about introducing me and he talked to me a lot of the time, more then everybody else. He could also tell when I was getting a buzz cause he kept looking at me and asking if I was ok. lol"

</lj-cut>
They decided not to go with us anyway, but when we left some women asked my sister if she was my mom!!! LOL. 

So me and mom then took half an hour to find the stadium. We got in there and found a seat. Ate. I was so clos to the ppl in front of us I was afraid I'd drop food on them. 

Dark New Day was alright, I didn't like them a lot, they screamed too much, plus I didn't know any of their songs soo. They were loud, the sound system was vibrating the stadium the whole concert. Shaun from Seether came on and did a camo. I sort of felt bad for mom cause she only has hearing in one ear and I knew it was hard on her. 

It took about half an hour to load the stage for Crossfade. They were ok. I think something was wrong with thier system like Andrew said. They sounded off. But I was psyched cause they played ""Dead Skin"" which is my favoite song of thiers. 
<lj-cut text=""Crossfade pic""> <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/googirl2000/crossfade.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com""> The guy from Crossfade </lj-cut>

Another half hour for Seether's crew to set up. They played Metallica's Black albulm through each break, it got a tad annoying about the third time though ;p. It was awesome cause they played ""I'm The One"" which is one of my fave songs the sing, I was hoping they'd play ""Love Her"" but no luck.Some guy pratically climebed over me to get in the row in front of us. He sat right in front of me and every other word out of him was the f word. Some guy showered the crowd with beer! Then one of the four guys in front of us pulled out a joint, like it was nothing!. Was the first time I'd actually seen one before. At the end they did a Deftones and Alice in Chains song. Of course he sang ""Broken"" for the encore. I was sort of bummed cause I kept watching backstage and I thought that I saw him and a girl walking in the back. I had heard of them bringing Amy Lee on as like a surprise guest and I thought that was her, but no luck. I kept telling my mom to wait to put my cam up, but she never showed :(.

Coming home we ended up getting lost, so it was like 2:30 when we got home. By then I was sort of getting sick cause of the heat and not getting anything to drink. 
But I had a good time. My mom told me I owed her big time lol."

But thankfully, it was another guy with the exact same name. 
I told him about it tonight, although I didn't get to the kid part, just the guy with the same name. It was cool, he told me to call him, and I told him my sister said I sounded like an obscene phone caller when I called on her cell, and he laughed and told me to call anyway lol :) I'm happy, that he has no kid, and that he wants me to call him :)"

We all were standing in the parking lot talking, and I walked over to the van a little away from them because I really wanted to go home, when I heard these tires screech and saw this black truck slam into the guard rail. Two other cars were in the accident, but I actually saw that truck hit the guard railing. And that screeching gave me the creeps. Just *shudders* and then the guys horn got stuck so there was this no stop drone of a horn. It was horrible. I went back over to my parents and by the time I got over there I was crying.

"event","Ok, for those of you that have nothing to do, maybe you can help me out. I'm trying to find tickets to the Seether/ Crossfade concert. They are suppose to be her August 20th according to BOTH their websites, but there is not any info on the KSF website, or ticketmaster. (although I will check again to positively sure)
I thought at first they were going to be in the Budwiser tent (aka 21 and over concert), but now i don't think they are. Mom said that I might be able to go, but not if I don't have tickets. (duh!) I really want to go see them in concert so if anyone can help me out I'd love them forever."

I've recently really had to take a look at myself and life in general and I don't like what I see. All around me is death and I have this hopeless, why bother feeling. Maybe it's just the realization of being shoved into the real world, or maybe this is just a bad time, I don't know. 

It seems like I have to surrender my life for my school right now, I can't even eat lunch and hang with Mary and Jessica for very long cause I have to rush and shove down my food and get to class. On weekends I'm so loaded down with homework I don't have a chance to even breath or I get behind. I haven't touched my guitar for two weeks and it's killing me. But I would have to pratice at about 12 at night. The only time I can get here is when I need to check my school mail, or blackboard. Haven't talked to Robby for a few days :( He came on Wensday and I had to leave him cause I was in the middle of homework. Haven't talked since then, and I really miss him, seems so weird to miss someone that you never even met yet. 

But the thing that bothers me the most is that I haven't been able to write anything for about 6 months now, I just have no time."

"event","Ok, this place is ment to vent huh, to get it all out. Well here goes. I have issues ok, issues that have been bottles inside me for the last 19 years. I hide these issues, why? Because every fucking time I find a ""friend"" they start to treat me like shit. I was never invited to hang out with anyone, and if I asked someone to hang out they would makes excuses. There are things that I don't tell some of you that I keep because I am too afraid that if I tell you then you will either think I am being winy or will think I have problems and will not be friends with me anymore. I know in my heart of hearts that you guys now won't drop me for stupid reasons like this, but I still have a hard time letting go of the mistrust of my former so called ""friends"" I don't want to lose what I finally have, friends that I feel like I can trust.

Also Daniel, I'm not sure if you will read this, or if you will read my e-mail first. I explained a lot about this there, but I want to say my piece here too. I don't want you to think that I don't want to be your friend, that's not it. It's just that I have always thought of you as more then a friend. Don't give up on me without giving me a chance first. Don't be like that, please just give me a chance. I love you, and have for at least a few months now, and I hate the fact that I do. I have opened myelf up to you and you just seem to try to shut me out. You say that you don't know me, but don't take the time to try to know me before shutting your mind to the whole idea, what is wrong with me? Why am I not good enough. I love you and I don't care who knows it. You said I should put myself out there, well I did. 
I would do anything to make you happy, and to make you laugh. What's wrong with me? I've never felt this way for anybody else before, don't be like all the other bastard men in my life who shove me off without a chance. Go back to before this summer, back to before all this happened, back to the Christmas Dance and me skipping Stevenson's class just to see you. You were the first person to see me for me, not as the girl in the wheel chair. You weren't afraid to be seen with me in the hall or walking me to class. You look at me in this way that I knew you were actually listening and interested in me, not just what I was saying. You are everything in a guy that I even wanted, needed, or even asked for. Don't give up on me. Please, I need this one chance.

Read this in one of my e-mails today :""Did you know that the three most difficult things to say

> 
>        I love you, Sorry and help me

Sadly, I do know how difficult those are to say. And it hurts when someone dosen't treasure you for saying them."

"event","Ok, all of you have these live jounals, so I finally broke down and signed up, I warn you, unless I have another week like this, this page might get a tad boring. What happened this week, well I was crushed, then made to feel better, then lied to and crushed again, but today is my b-day and I feel fine. A certain person called and we are on our way to fixing our frendship. Anyway, I won't go into details. Today has been cool, went to get some pasta at Fazolies after school. Sis came over and we are currently getting ready for a party tomorrow! Guess that's it for now, if anyone reads this, talk to you next time."

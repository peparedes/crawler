"event","&nbsp;so right now im considering buying the iphone.
i really really want it but its not cheap and i would have to pay for my own plan.
i think im going to get it and hopefully soon.

school is going ok.
im having a little trouble with math.
work is alright...i hate it as usual.&nbsp;

me and joe are better now.
i honestly love him to death and i want to be with him forever.
i cant imagine my life without him.&nbsp;
out of all the good and bad things we have been through he is the one person who always puts a smile on my face.
we have a lot we need to work on but im willing to take the challenges we face and get through them.

this weekend i work friday and saturday but im hoping to hangout with nicky after work on saturday and maybe a little bit on sunday.
i dont get to see him a lot with his school schedule and my school and work schedules.&nbsp;


the other day i was thinking about all the friends i have lost over the years and ones i have also gained.
i wouldnt trade anything that has happened over the years because it shows peoples true colors.
i also put so much guilt and blame on myself for the way things are but im finally realizing that im not to blame at all.
i am a great friend and a great person.
anyone who cant see that can screw themselves.
the only person who has seen that and stuck by me through all these years is joe. yea he broke my heart and yea i broke his heart to but he has always stuck by my side and that counts for a lot.
i am who i am and if people dont like that its fine.
because i dont always like everyone either.
im happy im not like the friends i have lost.
because deep down i am such a better person then them overall.
it makes me happy to know these things.
its so true when they say keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
true friends are hard to find these days."

"event","yesterday was such a god day.
good day at school.
good intervew.
good time with jarek.
and good time visiting nicky and auntie cindie.
then i came home and talked to joe.
just because he had a bad day and was crabby he had to take it out on me.
amy came over and we had a good time watching grey's anatomy and the girl next door.
but i still went to bed angry and upset.

i woke up this morning with a craving for dairy queen.
mmmm yummy.
and now im sitting here thinking.
i am so unhappy right now with a lot of things.&nbsp;
and im trying really hard to make those things better and be happy.
im trying to better my self as a person physically and emotionally.
im trying to make things better with joe.
im trying to build back friendships.
and im trying to make new ones.
but every once in a while i get a day like today when i feel so alone and discouraged.
i feel like im the only one trying..
i love joe so much and we have been through a lot but things arent getting any better.
hes not trying.
he doesnt seem to care.
sometimes it makes me think we should just break up even though i dont want to.
im sick of crying and yelling and feeling like i dont have him as mine.
i dont know what to do anymore.

there are no words to describe how much nicky means to me.
he is my rock and my bestfriend.
i wish that we were the same age and he was out of highschool and that i could see him like everyday.
i love that kid to death."

but this change is good.
a lot of good things have come from this so far and i only see it getting better from here on.
me and joe are amazing.
nicky is the best cousin anyone could ever ask for.
my mom and i are on good terms.
i can actually talk to her about&nbsp; lot of things now.
my brother and me see a lot of eachother and we fight but we constantly laugh at stupid little things everyday.
i love my aunite paula she is an amazing person.
she is so good to talk to and spend time with.
shes keeps me laughing.
i am so proud of her for what she has been going through.
my aunt cindie is great to confide in.
she gives great advice.
im so thankful that she lets nicky hang out with me and brad all the time.
i love e-mailing mrs rogers and mrs walker.
they are great people.
things just seem to be moving along wonderfully.
today i had a psych. test and i think i did really good on it.
i also had an interview today which went very well.
im waiting for a call back but im not 100% sure i want the job.
ill end up taking it tho cuz it pays great.
it feels so good to be happy and know that everything is alright.
no one can take these things away from me...no one.
i feel as if im untouchable.
nothing can&nbsp;hurt me right now.
its a nice&nbsp;feeling.

i feel like im missing something in my life but i dont know what it is.
suddenly im not as happy as i was last week. 
its weird.

im starting to not have faith in a lot of things.
i need a getaway.
thank god camping is coming soon.
it will give me lots of time to think and i really hope jordon comes to visit because i love talking to him. 
hes a great listener and acutally cares.
he is one of the few people i can open up to.

i have been e-mailing mrs rogers lately and she is another one of the few people i can open up to.
she cares and gives great advice.
im glad i formed a bond with her.






NO ONE knows me better than you
and NO ONE knows you better than me
^^^^
i love you nicky.
i hope you had a great birthday."

this is not where i want to be.
this is a awesome place to visit and party but not to live for 9 months.
i am very&nbsp; thankful to have this opportunity buts its not for me.


i was at a very low point quite a while ago.
and just recently i started feeling happy again.
i dont want to go back to being unhappy again and thats what i feel like here...just unhappy.


i cant be away from home like this.
i cant do it.


my mom is coming here today with my aunt to drop off my cousins desk and to talk with me.
i have a new plan of what i want to do.
i want to go home and i hope my mom lets me."

3 weeks until spring break.
i am going on a cruise to the bahammas with my mom my brother, my aunt my uncle and my little cousin.
we are going snorkling and swimming with/feeding the sting rays.
we are going to shop a lot have tons of fun.
i am sooo excited.

this summer is going to be so0o0o amazing.
i am going to spend everyday with my two bestfriends.
we are going to tan-smoke cigarettes-stay up late-and laugh every day.
its going to be the best.

next fall [i think] i am going to michigan state.
i got accepted a while ago and sent my deposit in.
i just dont know if i am 100% sure i want to go away.
part of me wants to stay home but part of me wants to go away.
either way life will be good.
and if i go away my best friends are going to visit me all the time and i am going to come home and see them every weekend.

i love high school musical.

i love tanning.

i love being happy and free.





the bad....

things with my mom suck.
we have no relationship except fighting.
i cant talk to her about anything and she thinks i hate her.
my brother told me she cries all the time about me hating her and stuff.
i love my mom so0o much and she does so much for me and everything but we just dont connect and dont have the relationship we we talk all the time and i can tell her everything...we just dont and i dont think we ever will.
it makes me sad.

things with joe suck.
we are supposed to be friends but we never talk. 
he only talks to me if he wants something.
i wanna be his friend but its so hard.
we always end up fighting about something stupid.

i cant believe that today is already friday.
last saturday morning i left for up north with my mom and joe.
the night before that i babysat my boss's kids. 
and saturday morning before leaving i babysat them again.
when we got up north brooke my papa and my gramma were already up there and later on my uncle mike and michael arrived.
we snowmobiled a lot.
it was tons of fun.
we went to this huge field a few times and just rode around for a while it was cool. we hit huge bumps that made us air borne. lol i hurt my knee on this one bump. its all bruised. lol
brooke rode with me everytime.
it was nice having someone riding with me tho cuz i felt safer if something would have happened.
i hit 70-75 mph. thats fast on a snowmobile.
it sucked that it went by so fast. i didnt wanna come home.
but once i came home i had to work then i hung out with megan and rob and i missed them sooo much.
i spend the night at megans on wednesday and then thursday her me and rob all hung out. 
of course me and megan went tanning wednesday and thursday night.
wednesday night i also picked up my cousin nicky and he spent the night at my house and hung out with my brother then he stayed again thursday night.
also last nite megan amy rob sean were over. 
so we all just hung out, ate nachos, and watched project runway.
i love the times i have with my friends.
today is friday and nicky is over right now.
i have to work at 4.
but i think me and nicky are gonna get ready right now and go to the mall for a little while then i have to drop him off and go to work.
then after work i am hanging out with megan and rob and possibly amy to.
i think megan is gonna spend the night over my house tonight and tomorrow night.
i have to work tomorrow to but not for long.

i am so happy right now.
i hope to keep things this way.

I never did believe them 
I know, I know they know everything 
I'll be alright by myself 
and no one's gonna tell me 
I'm defined, confined by love 

Now our day seems strange 
I guess my heart was bound to change 

I fell out, out of you and me 
Your fading from view and you're falling into history 
I fell out, out of you and me 
Your fading from view and you're falling into history 

I never thought that I'd say 
that I don't really miss you 
I lived I breathed your breath through me 
Time has a way of passing by 
Untill I don't remeber why or how to hurt for you 

Love's pain has gone somewhere 
And I'm fine leaving it there. 

I fell out, out of you and me 
You're fading from view and you're falling into history, 
I fell out, out of you and me 
You're fading from view and you're falling into history 

falling into, falling into 
You're falling into history 

into history 

I'll be alright by myself 
And no one's gonna tell me I'm defined, confined by love.</PRE></STRONG></FONT></FONT>

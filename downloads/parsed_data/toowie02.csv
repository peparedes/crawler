"event","Ok, I am talking to Sara (aka Ruqu), and Cydne, (aka Bucma) and it is so funny! jackson thought of a way to change you name to make it funny and i love it! You take the consanant before the one in your name and the vowel before the one in your name. So for me it would be S-I-Q-E. And cydne is B-U-C-M-A! i love it! an Hana is G-U-M-A, which is my favorite. I love this game! anyways, i got to do all my homework!!! bye, ~Toowie
By the way, i dont know what Quixotic means but i thought it sounded like a fun mood so yea!!!!"

"event","Ok, this is my 4th time trying to use live journal and i am hoping to mo's that it will work this time! So life has been unpleasantly stressful lately, but all the intersting stuff happened like 3 weeks ago, so im kinda short on topics at the moment. Well, my gramps passed away 3 weeks ago and that created a huge argument with my nanas side of the family about the will because they care about no one but themselves! thank god im not related to them! So anyways, that sad event did create a bond between my uncle jeff and I, so we email and talk on the phone every week .Hes cool, trying to get his life back together. hooray! so anyways.. thats kinda old news. Umm... Sara thought that Yt was dating someone but hooray, its not true! but she always thinks bad stuff is never false so she doesnt really believe it. oh well though, i know it is true!!! So, i have definatally taken a 3 hour break today from my work and that is really bad. But of well, only 3 weeks left! OOHH!! but i did set up our entire computer all by my self! im so impressed with myself! hooray for me! man, this entry is really boring, but nothing exciting is really happening. maybe tomorrow, something will! So i will make something happen and then write about it! yeah! ok, later! night night! Love, Toowie!

~Ultimate Elug! yea!"

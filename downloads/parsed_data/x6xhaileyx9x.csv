Cut my life into pieces..
I've reached my last resort, suffocation, no breathing..
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arms bleeding..
Do you even care if I die bleeding..
Would it be wrong, would it be right..
If I took my life tonight, chance are that I might..
Mutilation out of sight and I'm contemplating suicide..
Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind..
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine..
Nothing's alright, nothing is fine..
I'm running and I'm crying..
I never realized I was spread too thin..
Till it was too late and I was empty within..
Hungry, feeding on chaos and living in sin..
Downward spiral, where do I begin..
It all started when I lost my mother..
No love for myself and no love for another..
Searching to find a love upon a higher level..
Finding nothing but questions and devils..
Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind..
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine..
Nothing's alright, nothing is fine..
I'm running and I'm crying..
I can't go on living this way..

Brandy-Have you ever..


Have you ever loved somebody so much..
It makes you cry..
Have you ever needed something so bad..
You can't sleep at night..
Have you ever tried to find the words..
But they don't come out right..
Have you ever, have you ever..

Have you ever been in love..
Been in love so bad..
You'd do anything to make them understand..
Have you ever had someone steal your heart away..
You'd give anything to make them feel the same..
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart..
But you don't know what to say.. 
And you don't know where to start..

Have you ever found the one..
You've dreamed of all of your life..
You'd do just anything to look into their eyes..
Have you finally found the one you've given your heart to..
Only to find that one won't give their heart to you..
Have you ever closed your eyes and..
Dreamed that they were there..
And all you can do is wait for the day when they will care..

What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby..
What do I gotta say to get to your heart.. 
To make you understand how I need you next to me..
Gotta get you into my world..
'Cuz baby I can't sleep..

Some one is going to hurt you at one point of your life.. Its up to you to decide who is and who isnt worth it.. 

Love is when you dont see him every night.. And you wish he was with you.. 

Meeting you was a coincidence.. Becomeing your friend was a choice.. Falling fer you I had no control over.. 

If you really love some one, time, distance, nothing can stand in the way.. 

SomeTimes I wish I never met you.. Because then I could go to sleep at night not knowing that theres some one like you out there..

Does he really love me.. Or am I just a replacement of what he cant have?

I love it when you look at me.. Because I know for at least on second I crossed your mind.. Even if I try to tell you to stop.. 

The spaces between your fingers were meant to be filled with mine..

I can feel it again feel it again,
This isnt the first time,
That you left me waiting,
Sad excuses n false of time,
I saw this coming still I dont kno why I let you in, 
I knew it all aline,
So predictable,
I knew something would go wrong,
So you dont have to go,
Or say anything at all,
So predictable,

So take *him* if you want,
Your broken promises,
And all the time you stole,
Cuz I am done with this, 
I can give it away, give it away,
Im doing everything I should've,
Now Im makeing a change, 
Im liveing the day,
Im giveing back what you gave me,
I dont need anything.. 


Thx for calling me all the time</3

WAIT AND BLEED... 

I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed...

Goodbye!

I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
Everything is 3D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I CAN'T CONTROL MY SHAKES!
How the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong...
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?

GET OUTTA MY HEAD CUZ I DON'T NEED THIS!
Why I didn't I see this?
I'm a victim - Manchurian Candidate
I - HAVE - SINNED - BY - JUST
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away

GOODBYE!

You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free

I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell..



FUCK ALL OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","Tomorrow the packers (people who pack things, not the football team) are coming to pack up our entire lives into boxes. Including my computer. Which I won't have access to until August 1st when I return from choir trip to Ireland. *sobs, hugs computer to chest*

During this period, I will have occasional access to my email, either via brother's laptop or internet cafe's across the country. SO.

If you want to keep in touch with me (! which you should) <font size=+3><b>email me</b></font> at one of two places:

1. <font size=+2><b>[myFirstName].[myLastName]@gmail.com</b></font> - this is the one I check more often, and it's only for ""real life"" interactions, not forums and stuff. So this is the best way to reach me (don't forget the dot . in between the names!).
2. If you don't know my last name (for some reason?) email me at <b>[myLiveJournalName]@gmail.com</b>

So adieu until August!"

<lj-cut text=""Friends meme ganked from Aly"">

"event","Alright. This is my LiveJournal.

It is not for posting. Do not expect me to post here. Do not visit here and wonder why I have not posted. Do not contact me and ask me why I do not post. I am telling you right here.

I did not sign up for this to post. The only exception I will make to this rule is the LJ community <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/knitting"">~knitting</a>, as a demonstration of my old woman-ism. This is also for my friends list, because <b>they</b> have livejournals and like to post. And I'm darn sick of typing in all of their usernames!

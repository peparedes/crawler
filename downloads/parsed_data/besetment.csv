"event","Still not sure if I want to devote my life to the 88, but it's the best idea so far.

Other than that, I'm not going to justify writing a twenty page post on owning the most cynical view attainable and how it affects life in general. Instead, I'll find something shorter for that 15 second soundbite. It wouldn't be my post without any cynicism, after all.

This is my AIM profile:

<i>Insert trite diatribe which has a clever factor directly dependent on the age of the user multiplied by the time spent googling for former mentioned piece which is unoriginal yet is meant to describe the user while at the same time questioning the reader into thinking they are inadequate compared to the user.

Insert song lyrics which are generic and are reminescent of something related to prior paragraph, only in italics to dictate an innate ability to conform.

All pieces must be directly related or at least on a tangent to cognitive dissonance, with a splash of angst and a pinch of adversity.

Fronting originality is key in all cases.</i>

To this day I get people that are convinced I did not - could not - write that. First of all, I don't think it's anything special; a request was made to put something, anything into my profile. So that was written four minutes later. Second of all, I find it hypocritical to suggest I would quote someone when the point is to make your own profile since it does belong to you.

It has proven useful to scare off those who would follow its instructions, so I suppose it will stay where it rests for this specific purpose.

Thus ends today's serving of myself."

Does the meat arrive at the store pre-sliced, or is there a meat slicer in each store?
Are seasoned meats, such as teriyaki chicken, simply chicken with teriyaki sauce microwaved, or was it grilled with the sauce brushed on?
Is any meat actually cooked in your stores? (Chicken, steak, etc) or is it cooked, then frozen/refridgerated before arrival?
do you serve romaine lettuce, or iceberg?
Is the dough premade before arriving at the stores, or frozen and shipped?

These are genuine questions, as I do enjoy fresh food, and want to make sure that I am getting what is implied.

With a mashed in front end.

That I don't drive because I can't currently afford insurance.

However, this car has to be stored somewhere. When we moved into this apartment, they only had one parking pass, so we agreed my girlfriend would take it since she actually uses hers, and mine was parked in Queen Anne. The law states that a car can not be on the same street for more than 72 hours; so I found two rarely fully parked on streets and move the car between the two places for an extended period of time (since Nov 03) until apparently they got fed up with this (yesterday) and marked my car as CRONIC PROBLEM and I instead had to move it outside of CITY LIMITS, making this clear with a giant IMP in red letters in wash-off-paint on the back windshield. Because apparently parking on a half empty street for an extended period of time is some sort of bad thing.

So I decided to come in to work late, and get that other parking pass that was supposed to be available at this point.

However, the manager of the complex quit, and some new guy is taking over for him, and has no idea where anything is. Val, the other manager of the complex, won't be back until this afternoon.

Until then, I'm feeding a meter every 2 hours. Hooray."

"event","As I was walking down the street, a crazy bearded black man was shouting. I live in Seattle, and as such I am used to ignoring these things, or doing what is necessary to get them to stop bothering me. This one handed me a packet that stated 'Praise the Lord!'

I stopped in my tracks, and looked at him. ""Excuse me sir,"" I said with a curious tone, ""but what is required to Praise the Lord?""

He grinned and began cackling, from which I got, ""Why nothing! Just praise him, he's the Lord! He done made you!""

I was astonished. The Lord, whoever he was, had made me. Now, mind you, I was still wary of these types of performers, so I asked him what proof he offered. His response was one of an equal joy, flying from his mouth with a fervor I had never experienced. ""Just start praisin'! You'll know!""

I questioned why he thought people would listen to him, and not the other psychos on the street. He grinned a one tooth grin and belched, ""'sa powah of tah Lord!""

I figured this power of the Lord must be pretty grand if businessmen making millions of dollars were to stop where they were and join a cult that a madman preached about. Apparently this Lord fellow was so powerful that the only way to convince someone to join was by shouting bits of spit at passer-bys, followed by running them down with pamphlets.

I mean, this power must have been so grand that this man probably left his wife, kids, parents, friends and all he knew to convince others to 'Praise the Lord!'

I figured it couldn't be a farce. It couldn't be the fact that homeless people need something to cling to; why? Because this Lord is apparently not of this world, as the street man said.

I learned quite a bit in that exchange. I learned that crazy street men expect businessmen that make six figures to join a cult. It is a common misconception that businessmen do not want any connection to street men; in fact, they want a lot of connections. They want to be of the same belief, the one that makes you go homeless and preach on the street in a drunken stupor. People WANT that. Bad. And now they can have it.

Praise the Lord!"

"event","I think the most depressing thing I have to go through each day is getting out of the shower in the morning.

Think about it; you wake up, still half asleep and you stumble into the shower. You're instantly warmed back up from where you were in bed, even moreso at times. It's enough to make you shiver. You feel like melting into the essence with spatters off of your back, which runs down your chest.

But, as all good things come to an end, you realize one of two things. Either you have to get out to be somewhere, or you have to get out because there is no more hot water.

In my case, work beckons me so I turn off the water, the warm droplets joining and trickling down my body. However, without that constant stream of new hot water, the droplets become cold rather quickly, cooling you off at an exponential rate.

The state I hate is right when you grab for your towel. You bring it up to your face to wipe off the water. At this point, you're no longer warm. You're not uncomfortably cold, you're simply in a state that is damp and cool, and you'd so much rather prefer to be back in that warm shower.

Then you come to the realization that you're going to have to probably have to wait 23 hours and 55 minutes before you can have the warmth again.

Or at least, I do."

For example, I take several things to work:
- Wallet
- MP3 Player
- Book
- Black Book
- Headphones
- Badge
- Keys
- Bookbag

Now obviously the bookbag is large and rarely more than two feet from the door. I also (for some inane reason) tend to not look for things until a few minutes before I leave for the bus, which gives me literally no time to find something should I misplace them.

This morning, I was unable to find my badge, which was all well and good; a record for Mondays, as I can simply knock on the door.

However fate decided to make sure this wasn't the case. The Freud book I have been enjoying had found its way out of my bag, as I needed a book name from it during the weekend (as it happened, Venus in Furs; I couldn't remember the preposition connecting the two nouns) and my credit card, which shimmied its way out during a calzone order (and I must say, it was divine). There was also the MP3 player protective case, but considering my scritchy jacket is lined with some sort of fuzzyness, this doesn't really hold to be an issue.

Fortunately I have ten stamps on my Quizno's Glutton card, so I'll be getting my free sammich today, and there is also a plethora of candy from Uwajimaya in my work drawer to snack on and curb any hunger until I get home.

Erase the internet from your life. You can erase it from your past or your present, but your future isn't allowed. 

Here's mine, past and present: 

If the internet died right now, I'd be out of a job. I work for a payment gateway, which is essentially the individual who takes the transaction from your purchase on the net to the processor. I'd probably go to waiting tables or something. I'd lose all of my online contacts, as my phone number isn't very well known, and that would really free up a lot of my time. No more weblog or LJ either, which means I'd need to start some sort of documentation (as it's an out for a lot of my stress) related to life, probably clear up my handwriting issues. Thanks to the lack of crap to do, I'd probably read more, practice the piano more, and do more physical activities (whatever that may entail). Without the internet now, I wouldn't lose that much, as I'm slowly cutting off my addiction as it is. It would be weird coping with no email and the like, but it's not a necessity. 

I'm not going into global perspective, I'll leave that to someone else. 

If the internet never existed... this is where the 'Imagination Exercise' comes from. Let's see, I would still live in Colorado, I'd probably not have failed out of my first semester of college (damn you starcraft, napster and the like). I'd have never met my girlfriend. I'd probably be much better off financially and socially; knowing my test scores and personal ambition I'm betting I'd probably be making at least twice what I do now, in a job I like. This wouldn't stop the gaming, but it would cut down on it, as my main addiction comes from interaction with other people. 

Again, not going globally, I'm not that creative.

1. How the survey is invading on your personal life, and you're going to kick its digital ass.
2. Finding some extremely obvious unintentional grammar flaw, and making a horrible pun out of it.
3. Making an obscure reference no one will recognize, and then point out its there, followed by a statement about how no one gets to know.

5. Making the same vague answer slightly edited after you put some effort into the first 20 questions.

- Realizing I'm out of shape.
- Realizing nothing is really anything, and yet it is everything.
- Realizing not having a vocabulary is crap.
- Realizing that Kefka really is <i>the</i> best.

- Pronouncing Trigun wrong in my head.
- Wishing I had something to put that Tabasco on.
- Cracking my knuckles.
- Wondering if people really look over my shoulder, or if it is just paranoia.
- Imagining people commenting on this.
- Laughing at co-worker saying 'fucker' at a customer who just hung up on him.
- Swallowing the residue that collects from drinking soda.
- Looking at the toothpick I broke from a sandwich I had earlier.
- Taking a deep breath and licking the roof of my mouth.
- Wondering what the next five minutes will hold.
- Wanting to play the piano now, not in five and a half hours.

- Typing authorization at bottom of blog.
- Copying blog in case of IE error.

Perhaps if real life wasn't so fucking annoying I wouldn't have a problem with it. However, my problem stems from the pure amount of stupid I have to put up with.

- A retard gets on the bus each day, using a pass and asking for a transfer. While you don't need a transfer if you have a pass, he doesn't know this. The bus driver argues with him every single day about this. Totally worthless.
- I come in to work, and there are Christmas trees and wrapped boxes on either side of the elevator bays. Good thing that they also decided to fill the elevators with music, as I need to be reminded that it's December and that Christmas is approaching. Otherwise I'm sure I would have forgotten, or at least thrown a fit due to the fact that my building doesn't care enough to put up silver and red decorations on a silver tree with blinding blinking lights. I mean honestly, who wouldn't want to deal with that for a month? I should be grateful.
- This is probably more my fault, but the air conditioner is on at work again. I'm being told by my co-workers that requesting to have it turned off is some sort of mistake, as when people bitched enough about it being sixty-three in here, they just turn it off completely and have it go up to eighty-five. Excellent, glad my level of comfort is controlled by children.

These are things that I get to deal with on a daily basis. However this doesn't end the constant onslaught of stupid that I receive. Things can be stupid for an extended period of time, for example: My mother decided to tell an old friend about my website, and he's decided to e-mail me. Based on past conversations and experiences, my hypothesis is that he's going to try and butt in to my affairs.

They can also be short, for example: The customer on the phone is literally convinced he knows how to use the system, it's just not working for him, and I'm a clueless asshole who knows nothing. The fact that he called us for help isn't really telling him anything otherwise either.

I think I made the mistake by trying to believe in, trust and even respect the human race and society in general. Back to the prior, where I give people what they deserve, in my eyes."

90% of them break eye contact within the first three seconds, once realizing that I'm not going to let up. 5% hold it for a few seconds, and when they realize I'm not bound to the laws of their parents, also choose to stop wasting their time. The final 5% glare back, and skitter past me as quickly as possible to break it, proving to themselves that they really are hardcore.

I guess I really can't blame them though, most people don't expect me to look evil, especially with this haircut :D.

In related news, I was on the bus, and these two gothic chicks were confused about where the bus route went. So they make their way up to the driver and question him. He responds with a confirmation, and their response is 'rock and roll'. Fine, whatever; not my cup of tea, but it fit them perfectly, and they weren't doing the usual gothic facade, so I decided to leave it be. The old woman next to me decided otherwise.

Only after watching them return to the back of the bus and sit down did she decide to run her mouth about them, apparently pleasing herself as far as that was concerned. I was enjoying my music (as I am never without it on the bus) and realized it would be foolish to argue with her, as it was obvious she was too jaded to listen to reason.

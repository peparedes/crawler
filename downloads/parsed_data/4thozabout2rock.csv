If I'm the one who's confused, makes a bad joke, makes a big deal about something ... I'm WRONG.  Why do I always find people who always manage to be right, even if what they are saying or doing is wrong."

Now for the good stuff.

I chose the title of this entry because it pretty much sums up life in general.  What day goes by where someone doesn't have a question or comment or just something amusing to say?  I think it would be a great title for a blog in general, I'm just to lazy to start a new one when I don't post in the ones I already have.

Question of the week:  Why are my utensils frozen?
No seriously ... my utensils were frozen.  At a restaurants when I ordered salad, they gave me frozen utensils.  Cold to the point where I couldn't eat with them ... because they were COLD.  I didn't get it.

People are so interesting. There are some people that it would take a lifetime to fully pry into their minds and understand how they work.  Yet the ones that would take the longest to figure out are the most interesting.  I've always known that it's the quiet people who have the most to say, because they can't possibly be quiet and not be occupying their mind with some type of thought.  It just takes the right kind of person to inquire about their thoughts and learn about all these innovative things that that person had so much time to come up with.  

I like psychology and philosophy, yet sometimes they both get too complex for me.  Sometimes I just don't get it.  I don't have the time to get it, or the person I'm trying to ""get"" doesn't have the proper words to describe it to me.  Not everyone is as readable as others.  There are some people I really wish I could read or dive endlessly into their thoughts and figure them out.  And they are not necessarily people I'm extremely interested in for anything else other than their thoughts.  It's strange, but in a sense I kind of what to detach their mind from the rest of them and borrow it just so I can learn something about what they know.  People spend years and years figuring things out and learning things about a buttload of stuff that I may never have the time to figure out.

I have so much stuff going through my mind right now it would take one heck of a long time to explain it all and give each thought the time necessary to become a proper idea or decide to ignore it as something unnecessary.  I think I need a longer Spring Break ..."

"event","So you read that I quit my job and you probably know that I changed my major.  So since both of them somewhat coincide, I thought it would be a good time to start my new years' resolutions.  But they are more like life resolutions because I feel like I need to do them to make myself happy.  I'm not starting over with anything really, I'm just making it a point to take care of myself.
I already feel somewhat rejuvenated by the freedom and the knowing that I won't have to go back to the things I don't want to.  I had a terrible semester and between school and work it really got to be too much.  I can't let that happen again.
I need something else to be new though, and I can't figure out what.  I'm trying to clean my life up, both actually (i.e. I'm cleaning my room) and metaphorically (i.e. relaxation, etc.).  I'll see how I feel after I get the physical stuff cleaned up.  I seem to have a lot of clutter, which is also fairly representative of my brain.  Funny ...
Yeah, so I look forward to a really awesome start, even though I anticipate as always that it falls back to some point where I just get by. 
Oh and people, since I don't have a job right now, please offer to pay for my food.  I'm too skinny and too broke.  You know I'll return the favor. *hopeful smile*"

"event","Today was interesting.  I got to sleep in (YAY) because I had the day off (YAY YAY).  I hung out with my mom and brother for most of the day, and though my brother is quite the annoyance, it wasn't actually terrible.  Then even when we got home, I still went to coffee with my mom and the Greek girls, and then I even went shopping for food with my mom.  I miss my mom.  I'm really glad I got to spend time with her today.

I realized something today, though, when I was at coffee.  All these Greek/Canadian women all have coffee together.  Today, my mom took a survey of the women: how many of their husbands believed in gender equality.  It was quite a conversation.  It seems that gender equality never existed.  It's as if any man out there who believes in it should be a sacred shrine.  Men really are pigs.  I'm not sure what I would put up with from them.  What's my limit to how much shit I'd would take.  Maybe it's just husbands that suck.  As far as boyfriends are concerned, I know I have a great one.  I should make sure I keep him."

"event","I'm a smartass, so I'm going to answer all these questions that people wonder about.


Can you cry under water?
yes, you can. i have. the water washes away the tears very quickly.  it does help make you stop crying though...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



How important does a person have to be before they are considered assassinated instead of just murdered?
not very, i think it more depends on the person who is speaking.  plus ""murder"" sounds  a lot worse than ""assassinated"" ..



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do you have to ""put your two cents in"".. but it's only a ""penny for your thoughts""? Where's that extra penny going to?

nowhere, the person listening is just cheap not giving you your other penny.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you're in heaven, do you get stuck wearing the clothes you were buried in for eternity?

no, it's heaven.  no one is wearing clothes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why does a round pizza come in a square box?

because it's easier for the pizza guys to carry


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What disease did cured ham actually have?

plainness.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



How is it that we put man on the moon before we figured out it would be a good idea to put wheels on luggage?

keep in mind that there are some that believe that we still haven't been on the moon...  but it's because there is no government agency supporting the innovations of luggage.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Why is it that people say they ""slept like a baby"" when babies wake up like every two hours?

because for the 2 hours that a baby actually sleeps straight through, it's very quiet, cute, and probably full of dreams and happiness. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If a deaf person has to go to court, is it still called a hearing?

yes.  duh.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Why are you IN a movie, but you're ON TV?

because of the word ""a"" separating the preposition from the noun.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Why do people pay to go up tall buildings and then put money in binoculars to look at things on the ground?

because people like to see things that are really small because it is easier for their brain to process.  and a  lot of people decided to take advantage of this characteristic.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Why do doctors leave the room while you change? They're going to see you naked anyway.

because some people look really funny while their changing when they might not look funny just standing there naked.  when you're standing there, you don't have to put your legs through pants and bend your limbs in awkward directions making certain parts of you hang, swing, bend, squish, or be exposed in awkward ways.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Why is ""bra"" singular and ""panties"" plural?

same reason why you wear a shirt (singular) and pants (plural).  you wear a PAIR of pants/panties implying that when  you are wearing them, you are wearing more than one.  probably because of the seam down the middle.  there is no seam in the middle of your shirt or bra because it's one complete piece, not 2 sewn together to accommodate your legs



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Why do toasters always have a setting that burns the toast to a horrible crisp, which no decent human being would eat?

because some people like to eat burnt toast.  and someone else thought it would be funny to have people waste money on bread because they left the toaster on too long.  and some people like to put things in a toaster that don't necessarily burn at that setting.  maybe they toast their bread when it's frozen.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If Jimmy cracks corn and no one cares, why is there a stupid song about him?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Crack_Corn

no other explanation needed.  wikipedia knows everything.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Can a hearse carrying a corpse drive in the carpool lane ?

sure. no cop is going to pull over a hearse unless it's stolen/speeding anyway.  it would be disrespectful to the dead.  also ... aren't there 2 drivers for the hearse anyway?  i'd hate to do that job alone...


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If the professor on Gilligan's Island can make a radio out of a coconut, why can't he fix a hole in a boat?

because it's a tv show and there would be no plot if he could fix the damned hole


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Why does Goofy stand erect while Pluto remains on all fours? They're both dogs!

goofy talks, pluto doesn't.  
oh and again:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_%28dog%29  wikipedia knows everything.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If Wile E. Coyote had enough money to buy all that ACME crap, why didn't he just buy dinner?

because there isn't a grocery store in the cartoon, but there's an ACME god overseeing all his actions.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, what is baby oil made from?

minerals


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If electricity comes from electrons, does morality come from morons?

yes.  think about it.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Do the Alphabet song and Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star have the same tune?

yes they do


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Why did you just try singing the two songs above?

i didn't.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Did you ever notice that when you blow in a dog's face, he gets mad at you, but when you take him for a car ride, he sticks his head out the window?


i have noticed.  i don't really like it if someone with bad breath blows in MY face, why should the dog?  plus, we say people with bad breath have dog breath.  maybe dogs say other dogs with bad breath have people breath."

And every so often I think about those people, and I realize the group becoming smaller and smaller.  Kinda makes me wonder if there will be a time where I really don't have someone like that... if there will be a time where life just sweeps everyone away and no one really cares.  Is it my fault?  Am I / was I anti-social or mean or cold to these people that once were my good time, my trust, my happiness?  Or did these people just reevaluate their situations and find that their situation was better off with a smaller, more tightly knit group of people that I just happened to be excluded from by the luck of the draw?
I love my friends, but sometimes I feel like I don't have any.  Kinda makes me feel like my love is wasted and I need to concentrate it on other people.  People... worth my while?  But then how do I know they are worth my while when I had once thought a different group worth my while as well.  It's ... complicated, at the very least.

So I've found that, for me, quitting is a lot like ""breaking up with a company.""  I kinda feel bad that I'm leaving some of the people.  It was nice to work with Maria, Kiki, Anne Marie, Sharon, Sam.  I liked to talk to Larry and Chuck (the IT guys) whenever they came in.  But then the rest of them, it's like ... well I'll live without 'em very easily, thanks.  Like ... I'm not gonna miss Brian, Kassena, Laura or Vince.  And it's not that I have anything against them personally, it's more like ... those are the people you forget about until you get into the office and realize ... oh, them again.  I dunno.
But all people aside, no matter what it is that I'd be doing in this building with my current schedule, I'm better off without it.  And it's over.  At 5.30 today the only reason I'll ever have to come back here is to pick up a paycheck.  A few people said I would be missed.  I said I might stop by.  

Yeah.  So tomorrow, I had planned to go to work, but I'm not.  So I'm hanging out with Annie.  If anyone wants to hang out Thursday, call me up! :)  Because chicos, I am free as a bird (except tuesdays and fridays during the AM lol)."

Friday ... everywhere else.

So there were rumors of shootings and bomb threats.  ""It happens every year.  It's the anniversary of Columbine and 4-20.""  It was on the news as these rumors happening throughout the country.  No one had acted on these rumors yet, so that's what they were ... rumors.

They tell me it's Desert Mountain ... where some of the people I care about most still go to school.  Do you expect me NOT to call my cousin and warn her?  But that's what they want, right?  For people to be scared?  So I tried not to be ... I didn't worry so much.  We'd been through bomb threats before and everyone turned out fine.

Did you see the articles online?  Did you watch the news?  Desert Mountain is everywhere ... 6 people were charged ... with BURGLARY.  They stole chemicals from one of the chemistry labs that could be used to make bombs.

So ... so what, right?  No one got hurt ... 75 percent of students went to school ...
This is when it hits you... YOU KNOW one of the students involved.  He was in your graduating class.  He dated one of your BEST FRIENDS.  He was in the marching band with you.  HE GOES TO YOUR COLLEGE NOW.

When it's someone else somewhere far away, it doesn't hit home like it does when you're so connected to a person involved.  The president of ASU is saying there was a threat to ASU made earlier today also.  I really hope people aren't stupid enough to take advantage of ONE situation and make it a nation wide threat.  I'd like to be able to go to classes and not worry.  I'd like to be able to know that my  loved ones are safe.  I'd like to know that my school, current and past, isn't just made of idiots.  I'd like to know that the city I live in, the one most targeted by threats, is STILL OK.

I'm sorry, this is all really over done, especially with the media.  And I don't mean to continue it any more than need be.  But seriously ... as soon as I found out WHO was involved in the plots for DMHS ... 
I hope everyone is safe.  I love you all."

I looked into the glass and knew it.
I wanted to hear it, not say it.  Why?
I could not say it because...
Senor, sri, sisquard
And the lies.
I'm a bit scared, though.
I know my lies, not yours.
I know my truths, not yours.
I made my lies from truths.  But how?
Are your lies truths? Your truths lie?
It's empty.  Was it always empty?
Did you know before?  Do you know now?
You said it wasn't empty before, but was that real?
Don't hate me for writing this...
It's new to me.  Exciting.  Scary.
Which prevails?
I guess I'll see soon enough...

"event","I kinda had this random desire to post an entry.
It  has no purpose.  I might go off on a rant, I don't know.  Then again, I might type this wholel thing and then decide when I'm done not to post it at all.  It depends.  I also might make it private, but then again, no one reads it anyway.
I feel kinda blah this weekend.  Friday was nice, but plans almost got cancelled.  That would have made me :( but he decided to come anyway which made me :).  We went to Kierland, it rained, it was fun.  I like the rain, but I think if I didn't have such a long time to miss it I wouldn't appreciate it enough.  A lot of things are like that for me, but now I miss too many things at the same time.  I miss my friends a lot.  I got to see Ellie last weekend, but other than that I haven't seen any of my newly out-of-state friends since Sabra left for Canada.  I don't feel like I have so many people to trust anymore.  The few times that I do get to talk to my friends, maybe online, occasionally on the phone... it just makes me miss them more.  Plus, in high school, we never got to do anything as a group that often cuz there was always something to do, something due the next day, a test whatever.  And now that we all have a chance to hang out, chill, relax, have fun... we don't even live in the same proximity of the country. 
I feel like I'm spending too much time online chatting with people, but I can't help it cuz I miss everyone.  I don't get enough sleep anymore either...  and now I work, so I don't have all weekend to sleep like I used to.  But I like my job.  We have a good time.  Changing store managers though... not so fun.  Andy was pretty cool.  At least he was happy and excited to be there.  Who ever the new manager is, I hope he/she isn't an ass.  I don't want to work for an ass for $7 an hour when I can work for a different ass for $7.50 at subway that's across the street from my house.  School is ok, I think I'm only failling one class and I'm not really 100% sure that I'm failing quite yet.  Human Event... honors college... oh joy.  I might drop the honors college, because really it's not very purposeful for me.  I told my mom and she said she was ok with that if that's what I really wanted to do.  I just don't want to be a part of something without having a purpose to be there.  It's not like it's a load of fun or anything.  I got over 100% on my last calc 3 test, too.  How?  No clue.  All I cared to do was pass!  Anyway, that just reminds me how easy stuff is in college.  Even calc 3 as a freshman is easy for a past IB-er.  I guess IB wasn't really good for nothing.  But I still feel like I worked too hard in high school.  Or maybe I'm just a genius and that's why I can get an A on stuff without trying to.  On the other hand, I'm continuously reminded of how I make men fail calculus.  Long story, but the basic point is that I feel really bad...  I can't magically make people understand things, but I would like to...  Anyway, so calc isn't as bad as it used to be, for the time being anyway.  Java though... Java labs make me cry.  I cried on monday because I couldn't understand anything.  The homework is fine.  I can manage that.  The labs?  Ugh.  And the TA is an ass.  He doesn't explain anything and expects you to know everything.  Whatev.  Speaking of java, I have a test on monday.  I might fail.  It's a possibility.  I am going to go study now, even though I can't teach myself something I don't understand.  If you want to, call me to keep me company :)

"event","That's my feeling of the week.  The Irony Kills Me.  2nd semester started this week.  I was all excited.  I got to start over with 100% in all my classes and take Econ with Mr. Mooney, who I've heard rocks the world.  Monday morning, I realize that I was in a regular Econ class and would get to laugh at the people in it.  Now, I will begin using nicknames for people who have had them and will make some for people who don't have them.  If you really want to know who I'm talking about, you can talk directly to me.  That morning, my mom asked me what I would do if ""Captain Snuggles"" was in my class.  I hadn't been too worried about him because I was dreading ending up in a class with... ""blonde and not-so-beautiful.""  So I get to Econ (after I'm already having a pretty ironic day due to my Psych mid-term grade) and guess who's in my class?  Captain Snuggles.  Ew.  Crap.  Now I'm going to see how long I can go ignoring his pathetic existence.  Then, there was also... ""Sir TJ to the other Maxx"" who I've known since 3rd grade.  Then ""Whale 1"" is in it, who tried to choke me in 3rd grade.  And there's a bunch of other people that I don't like in that class.
Moving on.
So the rest of my day was also ironic.  Grades switched places with eachother.  History switched with Math and Psych.  Last year, English was my least strongest subject, this year is my highest grade.  For those of you who need to know, I no longer am ""Miss 4.7.""  I'm more like... Miss ""if they weren't honors classes, I'd barely make honor roll"" but whatever.
And now I will go and do all this homework that have and prepare for IB hell month (February).  Just to inform you, IB hell month may kill me.  If I die, I wish for my belongings to be distributed at the discretion of my parents or the person who purchases any of my belongings for me.  *hearts* Eva"

"event","I think I did what I promised myself I wouldn't do.  I've procrastinated (""oh, I'll have fall break to do it"") to the extent that I won't be able to finish it over fall break.  Well, see, I don't know... I guess I could make myself finish it all, but I'm slightly angry with myself for taking away my fall break.  Which is ok, as long as I get out of the house at least once a day so I don't die of boredom.

And for those of you interested in whether or not I am now the drummer of a band... in the 2 hours that I was being taught, I learned that I should just be the keyboard player.  (sad, isn't it.  or, we can be like Jethro Tull and I can play flute! not!!)

So yay for life!

"event","So Brent was looking for a drummer and a bass player for his band.  I would totally dig playing bass and would seriously work 24 hours a day on it if I could play it in a band (and someone gave me a bass).  So I said I'd play bass for him if he had a bass I could use.  He doesn't, but he has a drum set.  He asks if I want to play drums.  So, now, I'm trying to learn to learn to play a drum set.  I already told him to keep looking for a drummer because there's a 98.9 % chance I suck (I'd like to give myself more than 1%).  But, hey, miracles can happen, right?  (Wait until I tell him I can't do a drumline to save my life.)

"event","I guess I had something to say.  Maybe I don't.  Sorry if this is boring.
So, friday I guess.  I had a conversation about how my fingernails are ""stunning"" which was hilarious.  It was kind of like the ""skinny dippin good"" conversation except less... whipped-creamy.  Is that the word I want to use?  Yeah.  So, I was happy to be on the internet in my own house, so my AIM has my font and profile and I can view other peoples' profiles.  I didn't really do anything friday.  It was my ""day off.""  Saturday was busy.  I had to move boxes/unpack, which is awesome because I LOVE MY HOUSE!  It doesn't make any noise.  My other house made noise.  Like, normal house noise, but a lot of it.  But totally can't find anything (ie digital camera, sub-woofer (how do you lose a sub-woofer?), etc.).  I went to Wal-Mart and bought a folder with Johnny Depp on it.  Now my binder, folder, and quote book all match!  Then I baby-sat for the kids next door.  They don't pay well.  Oo Kate got a myspace!  Muahahaha!  Sunday was ""anime night.""  LaJuanda came because she left monday.  I didn't watch any anime (when do I ever?), and when there wasn't much else of an option I almost fell asleep.  Then the ninja kicked me and said he thought I was dead.  But yeah, I got to drive to Colleen's house!  Still have to learn how to drive the truck though, so I can drive to school every morning (as oppossed to just some of the mornings).  The only diff between having a permit and a license is with a permit, my dad just drives the car back home.  He's just there and stays quiet (unless he's telling me where to turn).  Monday, I was out all day buying stuff like shoe racks and organizers.... Whatever.  
So yeah homecoming is in 2 weeks and some odd number of days!  YAY!  Haha, hey vote:  should I ask Alice Cooper to homecoming (again)?  
Oh, in Vining's class today (i TA), me and the other TA had to superglue the chairs (like, the screws to hold the chair legs together?) so I thought it would be funny to superglue 5 nickles together.  But instead of supergluing them together, Jeff superglued them to the FLOOR!  (I stopped him after two nickles, so now there are 10 cents in change superglued to Mr. Vining's floor.  Nice.)
So gas is really expensive.  What's up with that?  $3 a gallon?  Oy.

I went to Wal-Mart (I love wal-mart!) and I found a shirt that says AC/DC For those about to rock! on it!! A shirt with my screen name on it? I had to buy it! (And this time it's not one of those men shirt things that say AC/DC.  This is actually a girl's shirt.  That made me really happy!)  Then I bought stuff for my cousin's baby girl!  (Shopping for baby's clothing is ALSO birth control.)  I also bought a notebook with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom on the cover.  (I decided that should be my quote book for my senior year.  My goal is to fill it, so start saying funny things people!)  

Oh, and I went to the library...  (*gasp*) and I checked out a book... (*double gasp*) and I paid my library fines... (*triple gasp*).  Neil, you'd be proud.  I read Ishmael.  When you told me it was about a gorilla, I didn't believe you.  Ok, well, it's really about a gorilla.  I find it funny that a gorilla can TALK.  Oh, and even more ironic, the gorilla can ""shrug.""  ""Ishmael shrugged.""  First of all, I'm having difficulty picturing a gorilla in an apartment, so a gorilla shrugging... oy.  And, I have this image of this giant ape thing with dainty glasses on speaking sophisticatedly (is that a word?) and trying to explain how things came to be to a MAN.  GORILLA.  MAN.  GORILLA.  MAN.  NO.  But, anyway, it was a very interesting book and it actually talks about a lot of ideas about how we live and stuff.  It's a ""thinking"" book though.  I wasn't really prepared for a thinking book.  It hurt my brain sometimes.  But I'm ok. lol. (<--Eva must be crazy.)

I'm helping one of my friends make beaded bracelets to sell to donate the money for breast cancer research... if anyone wants to buy a bracelet, lemme know....

ALICE COOPER DIRTY DIAMONDS! Aug. 2nd.  If I don't get this CD, I don't know if I would EVER be able to live with myself.  I *heart* Alice Cooper!

Oh, and quick advice.  Should I call someone that hasn't called me since... oh, october, and wish them happy birthday?  And another thing... should I IM someone that hasn't talked to me since April and wish him happy birthday?  I really would like to say happy birthday..."

So it'll be good, but maybe not skinny dippin' good. (lol)"

"event","Ok, so I think Prom qualifies for an occassion to type something about.
Right, so me being the person that I am take the SAT IIs the morning of Prom.  And it's not like I was smart and went to sleep friday night.  Of course not.  I went to my friend's birthday party at Desert Ridge until 11.  Right, so Prom and SATs on 6 hours of sleep.  Ha.  Very funny.  But somehow, I managed.
So for dinner, we (my table and I and our dates) went to the Melting Pot.  It was soooo good!  Totally got lobster!  (No really, guys, I'm not high maintenance, I just really like lobster.)  And our chocolate fondue was totally set on fire!  That was SO awesome!  
Anyway, so we get to Prom (as in my dad drives me, haha) and of course all the roads are closed off because of the baseball game... yeah.  But we get there, see people we know, and I'm like ""hey, let's go dance.""  And of course no one wants to dance yet, because all the exhibits are open.  So I find some friends and we dance!  Which is totally awesome because I love dancing!
Right, so I totally didn't dance with my date the whole time... I didn't even really SEE my date the whole time... So I danced with my friends! (yes, that included guy friends.)  I had such a GREAT time!! They have to do another prom.  I don't believe I have to wait a year.  Last year, I had fun, so this year PROM was all that was going through my head.  So yeah. Totally can't wait for next year.  But see, there's a catch.  Next year, we (and by ""we"" I mean me and whichever of my friends is coming with me) are totally getting a limo and so totally gonna party through sunday!!  YES!
I'm done now.  Ciao!"

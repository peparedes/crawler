Well I would like to expand on both of those things and give a little more insight into doing layout. Here's my insight. <br /><br />IT'S A PAIN! <br /><br />Well, actually it can be a lot of fun, but sometimes it is very frustrating. As Becky had mentioned we have the actual written article and then 3 or 4 illustrations to go along with it, and we have to put them together on the page. As easy as that may sound we have the ability to make it difficult. Mostly because we like to do creative layouts that don't all look the same. After all, we do pride ourselves on being a fun magazine so we don't want it to look like boring newspaper layouts. The funny thing is, one of the hardest layouts we did this issue was an article we were trying to make look like a collection of old newspaper clippings! <br /><br />One of our star writers, Erick Chase, wrote an article about Australia's famous Kelly Gang as a series of newspaper articles. Then we had the excellent Mark McMurray do some monotone illustrations like you would find in newspapers from the 1800s.&nbsp;And because both of them did such a great job we had to follow through with our layout and make it really come together.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/4156/blog2py8.jpg"" /><br /><br />A layout like this takes a lot of time and a lot of elements. For instance I have to scan in all the different styles of paper texture and create different ripped edges and aging effects. Then there is fitting all that text into the little spaces we've created by making them separate clippings, and they have to still be easily readable! Anyway there are a lot of things to consider.&nbsp;<br /><br />But not all articles are like that. Some just fall into place because the illustration dictates the way the words will go. This usually happens when you have a full page illustration which is&nbsp;easy from a design point of view (if the illustration is done right), but much harder from the illustrators point of view.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/1578/blogspread1vz2.jpg"" /><br /><br />Neither style of page design is necessarily better than the other,&nbsp; just different as far as who's responsibility it becomes&nbsp;to make the article work as a whole. We will always use both and, since I'm Art Director and illustrator, I will continue to pull my hair out over both.&nbsp;<br />See, I told you it can be fun."

But, unfortunately most of them were from people who are directly associated with the MCFC and therefore can't win. So the competition part wasn't too heated. It doesn't really matter because a good drawing is a good drawing, and they're all fun to look at. Ramses and F.W. even decided to enter this time. Which seems to explain the dried out markers I found laying around the other day.

"event","<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sorry, I kind of fibbed last entry when I said I would do another Foamlies Game this time. That will have to wait. But, I will talk about games!<br /> <br /> In every issue of MCFC we have a game that somehow relates to the topic we are covering. Sometimes these games are based on traditional games and sometimes they are completely made up. Sometimes they are games you can play by yourself, right there on the page, and sometimes they take a friend and a little more preparation. I like to mix it up from issue to issue so that you always get something really different. My goal is to someday be able to make a really awesome Moo-Cow Fan Club game book that is compilation of all of our games. As you can see I get really into the game and I love when I have time to really do a lot with it. It's technically Ramses' article, but he's too lazy to do it all himself. Which means I do most of the hard stuff and he takes all the credit. But he did come up with something pretty cool for the latest game.<br /> C The next issue (Pioneers out Nov. 1st)has a good board game in it that is based on an ancient board game known as fox and geese. Since we like to try all the games out before we print them Ramses suggested playing a large live-action version of what he decided to call ""Ramses' Spectacular Buffalo vs. Settlers Showdown!"" It worked out great and inspired me to make our first game with game pieces. The pieces for the board game are based on the crew of costumed friends Ramses invited over for the live-action version. Check out the Pioneers issue to see the final game, but here is a peek at the game pieces.</p><br /><p class=""MsoNormal""><img width=""771"" height=""192"" src=""http://img144.imageshack.us/img144/5764/gamepieceslx5.gif"" alt="""" /></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I also thought I would share with you some of the various kinds of games we've had in past issues.

"event","Sorry it's been awhile, we've been pretty busy here at MCFC HQ. Keby needed everyone's help to get her all of her vegetables picked before we got our first frost and Rhetorical needed my help fixing his bed, since he plans on sleeping a lot over the next few months. <br /><br />Anyway, as promised, here's the second installment of my 2 part series on how comics are made for MCFC. This installment is about how I personally do comics. It is a somewhat complicated process but I'll try to simplify it.<br /><br />I start my comic process by doing a really really really rough sketch of the comic just to get an idea of how it will flow and what the words will be.<br /><img src=""http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/9422/comicthumbtl6.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Then I sketch out how the characters will look in this comic if they are not wearing their normal duds.<br /><img src=""http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/5082/comiccharactersketchrx0.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />Sometimes when these sketches come out well, I'll use them in the comic. Like these images were used in the first panel.<br /><br />Once I get the look down I print out some light gray comic boxes from the computer. I print one row on a piece of paper so I won't have to draw tiny little pictures. I draw my pencil sketches in the boxes and try to get the comic down as closely as I can to how it will finally be. <br /><img src=""http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/5747/comiceg2it9.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />For instance this row is pretty close to how it ended up in the final comic.<br /><br />But that's not always the case!<br /><img src=""http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/7939/comiceg1vp9.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><img src=""http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/579/comicpg2qx2.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />Look at how much this row changed! All those changes were not made on the page though. They were made on the computer. Because after I do my pencil sketches I scan everything into the computer and generally tweak, stretch, squish, cut, paste, and all around manipulate it until it gets close to what I want to see.<br /><br />Once it gets to that point I can start inking it<br />.<img src=""http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/1387/comicinkjg5.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />Well, actually first I<em> </em>put all the words in to make sure they fit and then I start inking. I ink the comics using a electronic pen and tablet that hook right up to the computer. This kind of tablet has become a much loved tool by artists these days. From illustrators to painters, the art world&nbsp; is&nbsp; largely going digital. Since I can easily erase the ""ink"" I can make many more changes at this stage.<br /><br />Then once everything is inked I get rid of all my pencil layers and have just the final black lines. But that's not the end, in fact it's far from it. Coloring actually ends up taking longer than all of these other steps put together. You would think that since I can only use 2 colors each issue, and I'm doing it on a computer, that it would be extra easy. But, <em>because</em> it's two color and on a computer it's extra hard and I won't bother boring you with the details. <br /><br />Let's just say I color it and presto! A comic!<br /><img width=""716"" height=""858"" src=""http://img243.imageshack.us/img243/2553/comic1fa7.gif"" alt="""" /><br />This is just page 1 of the comic. To see the rest you'll have to check out the Pioneers issue of Moo-Cow Fan Club which will be out the first week of November. You can find it at many stores or *ahem* <a href=""http://moocowfanclub.safeshopper.com/3/cat3.htm?662"">subscribe</a> to get it delivered to your door.<br /><br />I hope you've learned a little something about our comics process, and more importantly enjoyed it.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">This might not look familiar to many of you because sadly lots of people do not notice our pet dedication section on the inside front cover of the magazine. Hence we don't get enough people submitting dedications. This is one that I did for our cats when we didn't have a reader's pet to do. Aren't they adorable! By the way the grey one, Pua, really is skinny you just can't tell from this picture.</p>
<img src=""http://img144.imageshack.us/img144/821/katiedogvh3.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The idea is that you send in a picture of your pet and a short dedication, along with your name. Here is an original photo we were sent of Katie the dog.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To make the picture of your pet fit our ""all illustration all the time"" rule here at MCFC, I color over it in such a way to make it look drawn. Then we place it, and the dedication, in the scene on our inside cover.</p>
<img src=""http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/1556/katiedogillustrationhb0.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is the final ""illustration"" of Katie (she's on a football field from our sports issue). </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We can work with whatever picture you send. Sometimes the weird pictures end up working out the best. For instance<br /> </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">I did the ""illustration"" of Shmoopie and then went to put it in our Weather issue and realized just how perfect it and the dedication fit with the lightning I did for the inside cover.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

So you should all send us pictures of your pets with dedications right away! In fact we need one for the issue we are finishing right now, and I'll use the first one we get! So, hop to it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"event","Here it is the first Drawing Game. I will post a new one here every once in awhile and I will do them in series or themes. This first series of drawing games is called ""FOAMLIES"".<br /><br />Foamlies are the creatures that lay hidden in little plops of shaving cream (or even whipped cream, or any spray foam)when it is sprayed out. I first noticed these interesting creatures when F.W. and I were playing a practical joke on Ramses after he had been prettyy bratty one day. After he fell asleep, and began snoring, F.W. and I sprayed a plop of shaving cream in his hand and were about tickle his nose when I looked down and noticed that right there in his hand was a funny little face staring up at me! I pointed it out to F.W. and he saw it too, but when he described what he saw to me I realized that foamlies appear different to everyone. Regardless of our difference in opinion about its looks, we both decided that we couldn't make Ramses squish this little foamly against his face. Instead we agreed that we should release it into the wild. I took a picture of our little foam friend and then put him out on the front lawn. He was still just sitting there in the grass when I went to bed, and I worried for him because it started to rain, but the next morning the little foamly was gone. I'm sure after he got his bearings he ran off to live with the other wild foamlies of the world.<br /><br />Anyway, I wanted to show F.W. what I saw when I looked at the foamly on Ramses' hand, so I used the photo I took and I drew over it. Then I decided while I was at it I would show what our foamly pal would look like while out to a lobster dinner.<br /><br /><strong>Original Foamly</strong><br /><img width=""534"" height=""489"" alt="""" src=""http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/6286/justfoam1jv8.jpg"" /><br /><br /><strong>What I see</strong><br /><br /><img width=""536"" height=""536"" alt="""" src=""http://img71.imageshack.us/img71/8090/nothungryif5.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><strong>CONTEST</strong><br /><br />I decided to see what all of you out there see when you look at a foamly. Below I have posted a picture of an untouched foamly and I am giving you a week to take this and show the world what you see when you look at it. You can do this however you would like. You can draw over the foamly in a computer drawing program or print it out and draw on it by hand. Then e-mail an image of it to me (ryan AT moocowfanclub.com) or post it on the internet and send me the link. Remember, show us whatever you see. I imagine foamlies come in all shapes &amp; sizes so don't hold back! <strong><br /><em><br /></em><strong>RULES</strong><br /><em>-All Foamlies must be in by 10am Friday Sept. 8th<br />-Please include your name and age with your entry<br />-Try to e-mail your picture to me, but if you can't you can mail them to<br />PO BOX 165<br />Peterborough, NH<br />03458</em><br /><br />Since these drawings are all going to be from your point of view none of them can be more correct than any other. So, to choose a winner we will show Willy T. (our gallery curator) all of the entries and whichever one he picks to hang in the gallery we will declare the winner. I will post all of the entries on our website after the contest is over so you can see what everyone else saw. <br /><br /><strong>PRIZE</strong><br /><br />For this first edition of the drawing game we have a super special prize. A Moo-Cow Fan Club Lunchbox! This is a very limited edition item because there were only about 5 ever made.<br /><br /><strong>Here is your Foamly. Quick what do you see?<br /></strong><br /><img width=""715"" height=""715"" alt="""" src=""http://img446.imageshack.us/img446/8045/justfoam2go0.jpg"" /></strong>"

Pioneers Back Cover

Hello all, and welcome to The Art of the Cow: The Moo-Cow Fan Club Illustration Blog! I'm going to  kick things off here with a look at a cover in progress. These two images are the almost done front and back covers for the upcoming Pioneers issue. This is them at about 80% done. Since this textured ""natural look"" is a totally new style for me I'll probably be playing around with the colors some more. And I also obviously have to add all the cover text and logo so people know what they are looking at. 

I decided to try a totally different style or point of view on every cover to try and make sure our whole Moo-Cow in a theme settng doesn't ever get boring. Sometimes I try things that end up not working at all when they show up on the magazine rack. It's important to me that the cover be creative, but sometimes I forget that it also has to stand out when you are seeing it next to a bunch of other magazines. This is not as easy to accomplish as you might think. It turns out that if you clutter up an image too much people can't tell what it is when they see it from 5 to 10 feet away (go figure). That is exactly what happened with our Baby Animals issue last year. I thought it would be great to show what was supposed to be a bunch of overlapping photos of the MCFC characters as babies. It turned out that when glancing at this cover you could not tell immediately what was happening because there was too much going on and too many lines drawing your eyes in different directions. 


<img src=""http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/6584/babyanimalssv2.jpg"" />

Anyway I'm slowly learning to simplify, but it's hard for me. I immediately try to fill white space and gernerally clutter up drawings. 

Well, this is the kind of stuff I'll be posting here. Along with some completely unique images and illustration games that will only appear on my blog. Check back this Friday for the first illustration game. The winner will even get an MCFC prize!

Thanks for listening to me and taking a look at my doodles.

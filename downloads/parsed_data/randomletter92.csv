I need to get a hair cut. its geting to long. and its started to get its poof back. and i dont like it. i like kanye west. he is about the only rapper i still like. the top of my deoderant stick fell off. and i am upset now. i dont like inky pens. they bother me. becasue they get ink all over your hand and the paper becasue it will smear. and its annnoying. i dont think that music stars should become actors becasue it never works. ya know it really would suck to spontaniously combust( your awesome sarah leroux) when im older i want to wear suits and look shnazzy. i like that kinda thing. natalie writes me really nice letters. i like getting letters. they make me happy. she doesnt even like to write them but she writes me some and it makes me really happy. i think it would really hurt to break your hand. or your fingers. or anything to be honest that would suck. it would also suck if your head was a gigantic eyeball. that would be to fun. ok well im going to go . i love natalie. and i will see her later. and im gonna show the love to everyone else.

I want to be tooken by surprise by a man with a gun and be shot in the lungs and drown in my own blood.
I want to be so ripped apart that no one can see my face, or distinguish if its really me.
I want to be stabbed by someone that has no reason to stab me.
I want to slowly bleed to death in a room where everyone can see me but no one can speak to me. or get to me.
I want to be hit by a car and be ripped in half by the force. 
I want to be beat to death for something I didnt do.
I want to scream until my throat aches and my eyes bleed.
I want my heart to stop beating, so maybe, it wont feel like this anymore. 
Ive had the same feeling in the center of my chest for the past 7 years.
Im so sick of it. that all I want to see when I look down is the handle of a 6 inch knife sticking out of my chest.

Sorry to be so meladramatic but thats how I feel as of right now.&nbsp;I dont know why...... no thts not right.&nbsp;I do know why, but it doesnt matter. In the long run things are very trivial. useless, you could say. the only thing that people can hold on to is religion and love. I have one. and&nbsp;I am truly greatful for that.&nbsp;I dont know who I am sopposed to aim my gratitude to, and thats why&nbsp;I dont have the other grip. So, I'm dangling by one arm, in a big world of useless comments, useless thing, and useless people. The only thing that&nbsp;I enjoy as of right now is the sound of my loves voice, but&nbsp;I can't hear her right now, and it hurts..... alot.&nbsp;I love her so much. and I'm sorry for being an asshole to her lastnight, but then when you think about it. There is more to the word love than you might think. I'm in love , I also love all my friends, and my family, and that makes me stronger. but every once in a while there is that weakness that shows his ugly face and pisses off everyone&nbsp;I know. and that is where I'm at right now. I'm sitting here alone. And&nbsp;I really feel like&nbsp;I need someone with me. Truly with me. And it is kind of depressing to think of my family. I'm just waiting for my turn. My Aunt, my Uncle, my Dad........, but there is also an upside to thinking about death. that&nbsp;I got from a movie called big fish. He says that when you&nbsp;think about death, it can help you becasue then you know you can survive anything other than that. Which is a good thought. but not quite&nbsp;right. I just want to move to alaska. My dream. and be with the one woman&nbsp;I love. who makes everything better for me. And brighter, And nicer. She makes all the bad thoughts and confused meanings just wash away. My mind is clearer when I'm with her. Or talking to her. She is everything to me. And I'm being very stupid. But&nbsp;I cant help it. Thats how&nbsp;I am. My stupidity is my personality. And&nbsp;I&nbsp;cant help it. I'm sorry. So... today&nbsp;I am going to go to the park. Try to relax and wait for the love of my life to call me."

"event","<FONT color=#ff6600>&nbsp;I am definitly bummed out. i didnt see my girl and i was relly, really looking forward to it. we were talking to these sluts to get jb, or eddie, or jr to get some play but they were hideous gremlins. i wasted alot of fucking gas that i cant pay for. i think jb is mad at us now because we left him with those monsters. its ok though. hopefully I will see my girl tommorrow and we can hang out becuase we havent hung out in a while. also me shawn,kala,jr,lance,and natalie all went to the beach. i have a pretty good tan now. im all sexy lookin. not to be cocky. but my lady thinks so, so i guess ill play along. it was really nice because i gotto hang out with all my good buddies and my girl which was great. ok well im done so ill update later.</FONT>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff6600>wow. have you ever had the feeling like your being ripped in half. mentally. yeah feeling that way right about now. I miss her so much . today i got off work and just went to our park and listen to all the music that reminds me of her. some may think thats pathetic but i dont care. i dont know it hasnt been that long. i just miss her voice. and her smile. and her rain drop kisses. everything. wow. i have never felt like this for someone in my life. I like it but i hate it at the same time. becasue when im with her im the happiest man on earth but when i cant see her or talk to her i feel like i have to keep touching my chest to make sure my heart is still there. I love her. I love her so much i cant see straight. its crazy.

p.s. its been like half a day by the way. </FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff6600>I love green tea. it is so good. but actually i like liquids in general. liquids are good. it doesnt even have to taste good. as long as its liquidy and cold i,ll drink it. i also love the word nice. its so ......nice. there really isnt&nbsp;a word for how nice the word nice is. its just nice. but if you want to feel nice listen to deathcab for cutie. because its nice and it makes me and natalie feel nice. i also like sleeping with out socks on. i never used to . but natalie had me do it. and i like it. its nice. i also dont enjoy sneezing. and for anyone reading this. you have to go buy the new gorillaz cd. even if yournot to in to them. its an amazing cd. its very moving. and it makes me happy. i love it. i also love natalie. she is reallly nice. and she is very pretty. i like her quite alot. i also like picky sticks. i also like the hulk he is cool. i wish i was the hulk. and that would be nice. because natalie already told me that she would still love me and be with me if i was the hulk. its just a matter of if my friends would still talk to me. also o turning into the hulk. thats about my biggest problem. that would be hard. ok sorry im lame. im done.</FONT></P>"

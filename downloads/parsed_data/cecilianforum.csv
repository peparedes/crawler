I guess that means you'll all be off having lots and lots of fun. And none of you will have any time for me, will you? You'll all be off making new friends and getting jiggy with it. I bet no one will post on me at all will they?"

Assuming you remember any of it. If not, post anyway - we'll make up stories about what you did and you won't know whether they're true or not....."

Sorry about this.

As some of you may have noticed, I've had a bit of a breakdown. Too much alcohol and Sexually Transmitted Diseases, my doctor said. 

So I've taken a bit of holiday; spent some time on the beach; topped up my tan; ate lots of ice cream - you know the sort of thing. Only problem is it gets a bit lonely on your own. No one's posted on my in days. I'm beginning to think no one loves me.

So I thought I'd hang out here for a bit. It struck me this might be a nice place to come and have a bit of a rest. When people think I'm too dull and lacking in banter, they always turn to doughnutdiary for some action instead. Which made me think that if I just hung around here for a bit people would stumble across me.  As it were.

Speaking of which, doughnutdiary, Where the f***** is Libby's wedding?
(And come to mention it, Where the F**** is Mrs Young herself these days?)

Go on. 
Post a comment.

You know you want to........."

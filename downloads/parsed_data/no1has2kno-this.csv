thanksgiving was like it always is...go to grandma nord's...eat...go home. nothing too exciting. this break is a busy one. i have only seen josh a select few of times. i feel for megan because adam is out of town. i would be pretty upset if josh was. 
but yeah. tomorrow i have to work, the next day i'm on call, and same with the next day. i swear work is taking over my life. but i guess it's a good thing because that means that i will have money. and money equals happiness...i don't care what you all say. lol. 
anyways, nothing special has happened. tomorrow me and megan work together! :) work is so much more exciting when we work together. but it's gonna be sooo hectic. oh well. that's just what you gotta sacrifice for good money. lol
wow so i can't wait for the my chemical romance concert. it's gonna kick major butt. i am really excited! :) !!!!

in other news, i have made my christmas list. lol. 

i think i'm gonna get offline now because this is boringggg....

"event","So I am taking into terrible consideration whether I should set my livejournal to private so that I can only read it. Seriously, livejournals are getting out of control. People use them as bitching tools to try to tell people they're mad at them. Can't you all just tell them to their faces? And I am guilty of the same thing so I shouldn't be talking. So this whole paragraph was pointless, I guess.

Well I seriously hope that everything is fine and dandy with the whole ""group of friends."" Because I was just so confused that I couldn't see straight. I'm sorry for everything that I have said about everybody and I'm sorry that everything came down to this. And I'm also sorry that livejournals are God now. 

Anyways, bottom line is, you don't have to read my livejournal if you don't want to. This is just a tool for ME to use as venting. No conflicts should be started over this stupid thing. 

*ahhhh* sigh of releif. Hopefully that helps. Probably not. 

So yesterday was Friday. Meaning that I was supposed to work from 5-cl but Jolynn (sp?) called and said that I didn't have to come in. Which was a good thing because I didn't really want to work that much. But I have to work today from 1-5. Me and Josh hung out 1 on 1 which hasn't happened in like 3 years. But it turned into a big almost ending fight. That kind of stuff is so depressing. And Josh, if you are reading this...

-I am really sorry for everything that I do to you. You shouldn't have to blame anything on yourself because you are a great boyfriend. I am sorry that I can't be everything for you. I really try to be and I really wish I could be. I am sorry for last night and I am sorry that we have to fight all the time. But I really want to be with you forever and I hope that we can work through our problems. I love you with all my heart.-

So today I have to try to get a ride from Megan to the mall, otherwise I can't work today because I am lazy and I don't have a lisence yet. *loser on me.* I hate always having to rely on people for rides home, and rides to the mall and crap like that. It's so freaking retarded. And I want my hair dyed too..but that isn't happenening any time soon.

BUT sunday is the TBS concert. Which I am completely excited for. It's gonna kick major ass. :)

Courtney and Jake broke up. I think because she likes Kevin. Or Nolan. (What's new there.) She is such a bad girlfriend to everyone. I feel bad for whoever she goes out with. Seriously, nobody deserves to be treated like that, and she blames it all on the guy that she's with, too. God, nobody could have it off worse than if they were with her. 

I'm sure many agree.

But yeah. You know what? Megan and Wagon are really cute together. I've just decided. 

And you know what else? I am really happy for Courtney and Brett. :) It's good that she finally found someone that she likes a lot...and ISN'T Bigbutt. lolol love ya Court. 

And you wanna know my final thoughts? I love Josh so much. He is the best boyfriend in the world. And nobody could be more perfect for me. He is so cute and nice and funny and everything I could ever want out of a boy. He is my dream come true!!!!!! :)

So I will leave with that!

xxxxLove Alwaysxxxx

I almost never see Courtney, Christine or Megan except for at lunch, and I see Fionna the least. Which sucks so badly.....:'(

Speaking of...

Fionna-I just read your livejournal entry from a couple of days ago and I have been trying to get a hold of you for the past hour. I know you're probably out with your family for Caitlyn's birthday. I am so sorry. I didn't know that you felt that way. Seriously you need to tell me when I'm being a bitch so that I can fix it. I know that I should be telling this to your face but I just have to get it all out and I don't want to forget anything. I have to get it off my chest right now. I am so sorry for making you feel like shit. I really do appreciate everything that you've done for me with the whole Josh situation. I know that times were hard and you really did help me realize a lot of things that I had to bring up to him. I am sorry that you are still mad at him and I wish that things would be better between the two of you, because I know that things don't always work out the way that you plan when your best friend and boyfriend don't get along. I know that I haven't been hanging out with you as much and stuff like that, and you really made me realize it. I really do feel like shit and that is definatly not how I should be treating my best friend. You really are my best friend and you're all I have, so I want you to know all of this. We need to talk about this more and definatly work this out because I don't want to lose my best friend. I don't know what I would do. Seriously I've been in tears for a really long time now, and I've been trying to find some words to help you realize this. I know that you probably are just looking at this as a lame apology like you said in your livejournal, but you have to believe me when I really say that I am sorry. I really am. If you don't forgive me, that's fine, but I hope that we can work this out. xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo I guess we'll talk tomorrow at school...

"event","So I went to Camp Dearborn the other day and it was a lot of fun. Me, Josh, Courtney and Bret had a really fun day. (Minus some of the troubles that were going on.) Nah, but all in all it was fun. I finally met Mary, which lemme tell you kind of bothered me a little bit. I don't know why, but I'm over it now, I suppose. 
So today was the first day of school! It was so exciting. I have a lot of really nice teachers.
(God I have the new math teacher again...I always get screwed over with that shit...but this lady seems cool...)
Other than that things went really well. I have a decent amount of people that I know in my classes and I think that I have lunch with my sister, Turtle, Debbie and Olivia Lapensee. So that's good. I still have yet to ask my friends what lunch they have but I haven't seen them. They went to Megan's after school which I had absolutely no idea about, but that's okay. I'll see what's happening tomorrow. 

10 more days until Cedar Point! I am so excited. :) The original plan was for Fionna, Megan, Bret and Josh to come but my mom said only one person. So that ruled Bret out...lol DUH! *no offense on him but I am not gonna bring him to Cedar Point with me for my 16th birthday...lol* And I couldn't bring Fionna because then Megan would be left out, and I couldn't bring Megan because Fionna would be left out. So I am going with my boyfriend. I hope you guys aren't offended! Seriously, I was gonna bring you guys. But the thing is, my mom wants it so limited because of the prices. But either way it's gonna be a blast and I am so excited. Plus it will be cute cuz we're spending 2 days there. So I am gonna officially have my first sleepover with Josh! lol :) I am so pumped. AWwwwwwWWWWwwww how cute! 

Other than that, I'm just chillin for now. 

I'm out! LOVE YOU ALL!"

"event","Yesterday was super cute. 

I had to go to my sister's cheerleading game. Which I had to be open-minded and optimistic about because otherwise my dad would've not been too happy. You all know how he is. So I was there for about half of Ericka's game and I realized that my dad was planning on staying for the Varsity game too. So Courtney and Olivia Briolat and I were walking back from the bathrooms and who shows up....but JOSH!!!! AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW it was the best surprise EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So me, him and Bret all walked around for a while and then Adam my Wagon showed up and we hung out with him. Then my dad tells me that we're leaving soon....:( but then he said that Josh and Bret could come over!!!!!!!! :) So they went to Taco Bell and then wow I had a boat load of people over. 
Turned out to be Josh, Bret, Adam my Wagon, Tommy Schaller and Kurt. It was a really cute time. But then Josh had to leave. lol he could probably tell that I didn't want him to go. awwww. 

But yeah today I think I'm going to camp dearborn with him. And tomorrow I believe that I'm going school shopping. And then the next day is school. Which I am kind of bummed about but you know what?? There is so many good things to look forward to. I am a happy girl now. And you know something? Things always get worse before they get better. And that has been turned out to be a pretty true statement in the last week or two. 

God really does love me!!!!!! :) lol

"event","Yeah so we all went to a football game yesterday which was kind of boring and uneventful. Seriously, I don't think I'll be going to anymore of those any time soon. There is absolutely nothing to do there except for look at girls that I hate and walk around. Yeah...maybe some other time. 
I finally got to see Josh for the first time in a long time. Which we both agree was kind of awkward because of the huge fight. Oh well. 
So after the game, me, Fionna, Megan and Christine went to 7/11 and got ice-cream and yummy stuff like that. 
And then Megan and I went back to her house and I spent the night. That was cute. :)
I don't really feel like typing a whole lot today.
I'm kind of hungry and irritated. So maybe I'll update later. MAYBE.
P.S. I need to get a job, I've decided.

"event","Yesterday was pretty eventful if you guys could all tell by the entries all over the place at livejournal.com. lol. Yes, Yes, my love and I were having some troubles that are totally and completely solved now. And boy, am I glad that is over. Seriously. It took like 4 hours to get through to each other. And right when I thought that we were making progress and getting better, shit started hitting the fan again. Which is kind of a good thing that it did, too cuz then a whole bunch of stuff wouldn't have been covered. I think this is a really good thing that all of this stuff blew up. Cuz then I would've never realized how downhill our relationship was headed, and how much we could have fixed it. I'm so glad that all of this happened because everything is 100% cleared up and we are both happy. I think you will all be glad that I stood up for myself and changed all the things that I thought needed to be changed, yet still keeping Josh happy. I guess in a relationship you have to make sacrifices. But we both realized that trust was the number 1 key thing and we need to trust each other more. So yes, everything is definatly cleared up and I am a happy girl. Now I think that our relationship is headed in a really good direction and everything is awesome now. :) 

I just wanted to say Thank you to Fionna. 
Fionna-Thank you so much! You are my best friend and you always help me through everything that I need help with! lol thanks for waking up at 9:30 yesterday to deal with my problems. And thanks for spending the day with me and talking with me about the whole thing because it really helped me realize a lot of things. I am glad that you are always there for me and can always recognize what I am trying to say about issues like this. Thank you for being there for me. I love you so much!!!!!!!! :) :) :) Best friends forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyways, let's rewind to earlier in the day. Yes, I woke Fionna up at 9:30 so she could help me. lol. I felt really bad but I can tell you that I really needed some Fionna counceling. We ended up watching some Comedy Central and the Hanson video for like FOUR HOURS!!!!! LOL omg it was so funny we were going crazy and making fun of Taylor the Hanson Nazi. and Isaac the cool Hanson which we never discovered. (Which might be a little on the homosexual side...) and Zac the RETARDED HANSON!!! God that little kid is such a spaz!!!!! LOL !!!! All in all it took my mind off of things and it was a nice break. That evening, my dad wanted me to go to the JV football game with him and Josh MADE me go...but it never ended up happening because he couldn't find his keys which ended up being in my mom's car and she was out somewhere. So I got all ready for nothing. Oh well, it would've been kind of boring anyways. After that me and Ericka got into the biggest fight that we've gotten into in a long time. lol. I punched her and then she threw the toothpaste bottle at me and I was PISSED! lol it hurt too....:'( yeah I'm a baby. DEAL! lol. So other than that I went to bed and slept really good. lol. And now I'm updating my livejournal more than I probably ever have in my life. Lol and I'm not gonna say that I'm gonna update it every day because every time I say that, it never happens. LOL! so we'll just stick to this for a while....
love you all!"

"event","So by now, Josh will be at school and not being able to concentrate because I seem to have managed to fuck things up once again for him. I cried all last night and didn't sleep well at all because of all this. I have no idea what to say to him, seriously. I talked to my mom and my sisters most of the night and they have convinced me that if Josh really loved me, he would trust me and wouldn't go prying into our Livejournals looking for stuff that he thinks I don't tell him. And if he really loved me that he wouldn't lay these huge guilt trips on me. My mom is so pissed off about all of this right now. She hates to see me depressed and she hates all of this when it happens. She doesn't think that I did anything wrong although Josh and I promised each other that we wouldn't do anything like this. It's not like I went off and looked at porn or anything because I wouldn't even want to do that. I think it's the fact that I didn't tell him about it. Which is an honest mistake because I forgot. And if I forgot, that means that it really wasn't that big of a deal to begin with, right? I have no idea. I really am kind of upset that he doesn't trust me enough to believe me when I say stuff and has to go reading Fionna's livejournal. I wanted to call her so bad after all of this last night and I still want to but I know that she will be sleeping right now. I need to talk to her so bad. She's my best friend and she always knows what to say to me and what to tell me that makes sense. Hopefully she's not working today so I can go over there or something like that. I'm just really depressed because I don't even know what to say to Josh when he gets home. I mean I said sorry a million times last night and he doesn't want to forgive me because he wants to make me upset like he is. He wants to make me feel bad about all of this. Which my mom also thinks is bullshit because he shouldn't be doing that to me if ""he loved me."" But being totally and completely honest, he is one person that I will never EVER be able to figure out. I can't ever tell what he's thinking and I can never tell how he will react to certain things. I can't even begin to read him like a book and he wont allow it. He always has to be right about everything, even if it is the stupidest little thing. I have no idea. I think that I'm bad for him, actually. I think that I cause all these problems because I am more leniant about all this stuff than him. I mean he hugs girls all the time when he is with Bret. And sure it makes me mad when he does that, because he says they're only friends and that it's ""not his fault."" But you don't see me going off and being pissed at him about it. Seriously even if he looked at a porn I wouldn't care. I WOULDN'T! And to be very honest, if he went out with Bret to the mall or whatever and they were having a good time and he looked at a Kama Sutra book to see what it was all about, I would not care. I might have used to way back when when I was unsure about all of this, but I trust him. And I care about him enough to let him go do whatever he wants. If you love something, let it go. And I'm going to tell him this. And I'm going to tell him that I need to be more of a person and that he can't control me. And if he doesn't like that, well then, something drastic will have to happen. If you love something, let it go. If it comes back, then it was meant to be. If it stays away, then it was never meant to be. My mom always tells me that and now I'm really starting to believe it. He has to love me as much as I love him. And we have to let each other be more free. It has to happen because being controlled is not what love is about. I have no idea. I need some help. And maybe me just causing him more problems is gonna ruin our relationship. Maybe I should just cut it off before it gets too bad. As much as I don't want to. Maybe that's the right thing to do. I told him to figure it out last night. I told him to. Something has to happen. And I don't know what. I need to figure this out."

"event","So yesterday was a weird day to start off. I went to Courtney's freshman orientation and it was completely insane. seriously! there were like 8 million people there pushing and shoving and it was just retarded. but it was cute to see my lil sissy in the big old high school. awwwww cute little thing. i'm gonna walk her to her locker the first day. lol aww what a great big sissy i am! so after that we went home and my mom and dad had to go finalize the deal on our new high tech car that we've just purchased which is pretty cool if i do say so myself. 

so josh and i talked on the phone like all day...surprise surprise. lots of weird stuff happened. idk i love josh and everything, but sometimes he just amazes me with the stuff that he DOES. i love him to death though. and i feel really bad that i hung up on him for a stupid reason. seriously i just tried to prove a point and it all blew up in my face. i feel really bad now cuz i made him feel really bad and there's no reason for that. sometimes i just have to be more sensitive to the fact that he's a really sensitive guy. but i love him that way and i would never change anything that we have for the world. 

so he went to the movies with greggie j and matt soulliere and bret tucker and they went to go see napoleon dynamite while i was out with my girls fionna and christine! lol first we went to borders which was quite an adventure!!! LOL !!!!! man good times girls. and then we tried to look for some CD's and they disappointed the crap out of me when they didn't have what i want. (possibly because i was looking for the wrong thing the whole time...lol RED FACE!) so then fionna is telling me what she's getting me for my birthday...well telling me that it's something super super cool so i am like begging her to tell me. but she WONT! GRR! lol 
so we finally get to the mall and me and christine to go hot topic...TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER ONE OF JOSH'S PRESENTS AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE SHIRTS I WANT IN HIS SIZE!  BASTARDS! so i guess i am just gonna go back some other time and look. so fionna shows up and she bought me my VANS SHOES THAT I'VE WANTED FOREVER! it was awesome! i was sooo happy. then after that we went into forever 21 to try on some hilarious outfits and we were singing hilary duff and jlo and all that good stuff. omg we were dying laughing it was so hilarious. fionna actually bought a really cute white and flowery skirt and it was adorable! so the mall was closing in less than 4 minutes and i RAN down to fye and this is where it got really interesting. lol i thought the cd that josh wanted was by BAD RELIGION which turns out it was by the suicide machines. omg major red face. it was so embarssing. those poor guys i made 'em stay after closing time to help me. lol but if it's for my boyfriend, it was all worth looking compltely retarded for. LOL !!!! so after that me and fionna really had to pee like maniacs so we left the mall and went to mcdonalds to use the toilets and to get some free water. lol which i am obsessed with. LOL !!!! yeah i'm cheap. so yeah as we were going home we heard the new used song which totally kicks ass. it's like massive screamo ness and i can't wait to get the cd which somes out september 27th!!! WOO HOO!!!!

other than that, we listened to poison on the ride home and then i went home and talked to josh for his last day of summer vacation. :( yes, sadly he is at school right now. poor boy. aww i love him so much. 

alright well this is getting longer than normal so i'm gonna go now. kk? love all of you so much!

school is in 7 days....:(

love kristan!"

"event","for all of you that didn't know i got a new s/n... it's 
xBigxChoicex
Which is a song by the one and only FACE TO FACE if you guys didn't know! lol DUH!

speaking of face to face...the concert was absolutely incredible! probably the best concert i've ever been to in my life. seriously i'm not joking. they are like the best band in the world and i would do anything to see them again. but that's not gonna happen cuz they're gone :'( but josh tells me that trever keith is coming out with a solo album that will more than likely be acoustic with a bunch of emo songs...cuz duh what else are you gonna do when you go solo!?!? so yeah that comes out in late 2005 which i will definatly be getting. anyway back to the concert. i got pete's drumstick! and we met trever and scott! and we got pics and they signed our tickets! omg it was awesome...lol can't say that i wasn't completely starstruck. 

thursday was school pictures and registration and i don't have very many classes with people that i know. none w/ courtney or christine, and i have brit lit 2 with fionna second semester and deutsch drei with evan mayernik second semester. i think i have sociology with stephanie jones first semester though. oh well i'll get by. lol my pictures are probably gonna turn out really goofy. i mean i was really really red face. lol but my ID pictures turned out really good. so hopefully that is some specification of how my other one's are gonna look. so after that, me and fionna and courtney and christine went out to breakfast at coney island. lol that was really fun because we were really loud and laughing really hard. it was really fun.

so other than that, megan's doggy died. :( which is really sad because it was so young and so lively. that poor thing. i feel really bad for all of them because they all loved that dog so much and they're really going to miss it. :( aww RIP daisy. so yesterday to try and cheer megan up i had all the girls over for some girlie time and it was really fun! we watched dirty dancing and then courtney and christine had to leave because court's mom didn't want her out or something. and then there was a huge conflict between me and my stupid father but oh well that's all settled now. so yeah me and fionna and megan all watched gothika and got really scared. lol even though it was megan's third time watching it. me and fionna were still pretty scared. i mean it's not an actually scary movie, it's just starteling. but all in all it was pretty good and i had a really good time yesterday. 

today i haven't done anything at all and it has been really boring. i talked to josh for a while but he had to get off the phone because his mom was expecting a call from someone. so then i talked to him again and we planned for me to go over to his house at 5 which is very soon because my parents are going into Howell anyways to go to Lowes or something. so yeah that will be fun. i am excited! :) i love my josh. ...lol as if you guys didn't know. 

well i have to go now because we're leaving! i'll talk to you guys later! xoxo lyl buh*bye!

"event","so yesterday was really really eventful! lol it was quite fun. 
Me and josh talked all morning planning ""the day."" so my mom finally decided to drive courtney, me and lorrain and her brother tommy to the movies at like 4:10 or something and we picked up my joshua on the way!!!! **:)**~! so when we got there we watched probably 20 mintues of napoleon dynamite and then bret decided to help us out and ""lend"" us his car. lol he is a very nice person and i am very grateful because me and josh had a VERY WONDERFUL time! lol i'm sure you can probably guess what happened. it was GREAT! :) i love my boyfriend. lol
so after that bret took us to taco bell and we ate some food. and let me add that the new mountain dew is really yummy. lol. so after that mrs.brown picked us up at the movies and took me back to their house and joshua and nolan played me some wonderful music. lol! josh is really really really super good at the guitar and he's an awesome singer too. i was in heaven! :)! i love my boyfriend.
so then mrs.brown took me home and i felt super bad because we had to take the expressway which took forever cuz the traffic was super backed up. so i felt really bad but she assured me that it was okay. and then on 89x all the good songs were on and me and josh were singing the whole way home! lol it was a really good day. 
but i miss him now. :( lol it's okay i will see him soon.
my daddy's birthday is tomorrow and i'm supposed to be making him something but i guess i will do it a little later. 
i think fionna is on the three day right now w/ her mom. i hope she comes home soon cuz i am really bored today and josh is on his boat and idk if i will be able to come w/ him or not. probably not cuz my daddy is out golfing right now and he wont wanna take me. :(
so only 4 more days 'til the face to face concert which i am still totally and completely pumped for!!!!! :)! and yeah the day after that is registration for school. which will be cool to see what classes i have and who i have 'em with. but idk what i'm gonna wear for pictures. i dont wanna go back to school. :( but i kind of do at the same time. 
in september me and josh and my family get to go to cedar point together! woo hoo! i am so excited for that. wow lots of good things happening lately. lol i can't wait.

But he didn't come home until 3:00 or so and my parents wouldn't let us do anything because they had a ""meeting"" to go to. But I had a fairly good day yesterday. I woke up and I probably watched all of the I Love The '90's episodes. LOL I LOVE VH1!!!! WOO!!!!! It was all great fun. Then I did a lot of situps and leg excercizes because I want to look good in a bathing suit for the remainder of the summer. Then my mom came home from work around 1:00 and asked me if I wanted to go into Novi and go to Old Navy and some stuff like that. I was like, ""Hey, what the heck."" lol and it was cute because we had a lot of good bonding time. I love my mommy! She's the greatest. So I got part of Fionna's supercool awesome birthday present that I hope she loves! Cuz I would love it. Which pretty much means that she's gonna love it too. Lol seeing as we're pretty much the same person. Which is a good thing! :)! lol. Anyways, so I got home and found out that my Joshua called me! So OF COURSE I called him back! lol DUH I LOVE HIM! :D!!! 
So we were supposed to go to the movies but my parents wouldn't let me because I think they had a bad ""meeting"". Which I totally understand because I feel bad for that situation...but I really wanted to see Josh! 

But it's okay because today I get to see him! Hopefully I can go to his house around 12:30 or 1:00 and we can hang out 'til he has to go to this orthodontist appointment which I am going to with him and then we'll probably go to the movies or something after that and then back to his house! And his parents will drive me home because I love them and they love me. LOL !!! So if today works out, it will be a splendid time. Cross your fingers! lol. 

Anyways, I will write later if all plans work out!!!!! :D !!!!

"event","Well I think Josh is coming home today because I haven't been able to get a hold of him on his mom's cell phone all day. Which is a very good thing! :) Tonight is Courtney's birthday party at Olivia Lapensee's house and I am stuck home doing absolutely nothing. Which is why I have decided to update my livejournal. lol!!! I guess I'll give you some updates...

I went and seen the Notebook for a second time with my mom and Debbie while Courtney and Adam were in Anchorman for Court's birthday. I love that movie to death! Me and Debbie had a really fun time. But I was debating the whole time if I should tell her about Bret wanting to break up with her.

Then yesterday me, my mom and my sisters went to my Aunt Coleen's house yesterday (which was really boring) and sat by the pool. Then Josh called me and confirmed that Bret is breaking up with Debbie because he is an ass hole and wants some other girls or whatever...I don't know...sounds stupid to me why he would want to let someone like Debbie go, but whatever. It's his decision and I'm not going to interfere. Except for today when I told Debbie all of this. She is more pissed than upset but I know she'll end up being sad in the end. I know how much she really liked Bret. But she'll find someone new. We all knew it wouldn't last forever. I just thought I should tell her because...DUH!!! Wouldn't you want to know!? I would. 

Anyways, so I miss Josh a whole lot. Hopefully we get to see each other tomorrow because I am having MAJOR Josh withdrawls. Courtney is all with her boyfriend and stuff and it makes me REALLY jealous because she is only in 8th grade. Idk...she's just stupid I guess. 

But yeah, Fionna is in Alabama right now and I miss her TERRIBLY! I mean, who is around to entertain me!?!?!? NOBODY!!! MYSELF!!!! GOD!!!! But I think the plan is that we're all gonna hang out when she gets back. Because that beeyotch is RETIRED FROM BEING RETIRED! lol which means she really wants to go to Camp Dearborn and meet some dudes. Lol this should be hilarious. I can't wait for this. LOL !!! 

Anyways, I should go now because I am a boring individual.
I LOVE JOSH!

lol 

Oh, Matt Massuch...if you're reading this...I apologize about what I wrote in my livejournal that you were offended about a while back. I think you know what I am talking about. So I really apologize. I hope you forgive me."

"event","Well I haven't written in a while... (lol what's new with that one) So i'll start off with my vacation up north with my family. 
We started off at the Zachar's cabin which was fairly uneventful...(as usual) and then traveled to Ludington to go stay with my Aunt Tinker for a while. Which ended up that we were there for a couple days with just our family and then all the reletives came up. (Grand Uncle, Aunt Louise, Aunt Tinker and Rummy.) The reletives from California were good but my Aunt Tinker was extremely wasted and got into a huge fight with my dad so we left early. Which was a good thing too, because at that point if i didn't see Josh, I would have killed someone. I missed him SOOO much that whole week because of the whole ordeal that happened the day before we left. My dad didn't let me talk to him most of the time that we were there and it was really rough being up there with just my family...bored as hell...not talking to josh. So yeah that vacation was the suckiest one of all time. 

But anyways, when we got home, Josh came over and met my extended family and we played softball at the high school feild and just hung out. I missed him sooo much that when he first stepped in the door we must have stood there hugging and kissing for like...10-15 minutes. I LOVE HIM SO MUCH! It was really cute. But the day after that, he left for Wisconsin and he's still there. He said that he's gonna try to get his parents to leave on Monday or Tuesday or something rather than Wednesday. Hopefully he can come home soon and see me because I miss him SO much...:'( *tears....*

But it's been refreshing to have some girl time with Fionna and Megan. I've been at Fionna's house for like the past...3 days...lol. I spent the night at her house on...let's see...Wednesday night? Yeah. It was a lot of fun and I missed Fionna SO much! On Thursday, we dyed our hair with Kool-Aid and it turned out pretty cool. Jack got a mohawk! lol it looks really cool. He's one of the few people that I think can pull that kind of thing off. He's a ballsy 9th grader, let me tell you. If I was a dude I would NOT be able to do that. So yesterday, I went and got my new glasses which are really cute ... I like 'em...and me, fionna and megan all went into novi to go see The Notebook which is a REALLY good movie. I CRIED SO HARD! And then OF COURSE we went to Coldstone and got some ice cream which was much needed after that movie. lol. 

And man, I've got a lot of new music material!
Let's review...

Coheed & Cambria: In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3 
-------------------------------------------------------
Overall a pretty good CD...it's a lot different than what I expected, but hey it's new and refreshing I guess...
-------------------------------------------------------
Green Day: International Superhits
--------------------------------------------------------
DUH that's definatly good...Green Day is the best.
-------------------------------------------------------
Pennywise: Straight Ahead
-------------------------------------------------------
Sounds a lot like face to face...which is definatly a good thing. I like pennywise! lol
---------------------------------------------------------
Nevermind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols!
---------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to give this CD a go and see what was goin on w/ it...it's pretty good and it's good to listen to when you're in a really good happy mood!
-----------------------------------------------------------
Thrice: The Artist in the Ambulance
----------------------------------------------------------
It's about time that I got this CD. I mean i liked the first one, but I really like this one a lot.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Alright kids! Well that is my new collection of CD's! lol

So yeah. Tomorrow is Courtney's birthday. I got her a copy of my Matchbook Romance cd. Which she is officially obsessed with. Jeeeeez. I'm almost sick of them now, I've heard them so much. But idk how that could happen. lol. OH YEAH! I ordered my Warped Tour and Face To Face tickets!! YEAHHH WOOO!!! I am so excited. But i'm royally pissed off because Alkaline Trio isn't gonna be at Warped Tour and neither is Motion City Soundtrack. Wow I am extremely pissed about that. But oh well it will still be fun. And I am really wanting the new Taking Back Sunday cd. So anybody who has it...(AKA MATTHEW MASSUCH) please contact me! because i want it badly! 

Alright well my wrists are getting sore. So plans for today...WHO KNOWS! I am probably gonna go down to Fionna's house again so she can burn my Places You Have Come To Fear The Most CD. And we'll probably hang out or somethin like that. Do what we do best! lol. But i have to call Josh in like 20 minutes so I have to wrap this up! 

***I LOVE MY JOSH!!!***He COMES HOME IN 2 OR 3 DAYS! ***

love, Kristan!"

"event","So I'm bored this morning because as of right now, I am doing nothing today. Yeah, that's right, absolutely nothing. I'm gonna see if maybe Fionna and Megan wanna go see a movie with me or something like that cuz Josh is gonna be at camp today. (And I can't go with him because my stupid parents are being stupid again...AS USUAL) But yeah, I guess I could use some girl time. But I'm trying to spend as much time as possible with Josh this week because I'm leaving on either late Saturday/early Sunday to go up north to the Zachar's cabin for a couple days. And then from there we are going to Ludington (my Aunt Tinker's house *AHHHHH!!!!!*) for the rest of that GAY ASS trip. I am so pissed off because we are going to be gone for like 2 fucking weeks. And then the DAY I get back, Josh is going to Wisconsin with Bret. For a week. Which means I wont get to see him for 3 weeks. Which is muy depressing to me. But yeah, we hung out Monday (he came to my house and to Ericka's softball game with me.) We played guitar for quite sometime...well he played guitar, and I just listened to him school me. He's sooo good. And he played me Dashboard *:)* Which, DUH, made me cry because he is just such a great and romantic boyfriend. I LOVE JOSH! So yeah, that was a lot of fun. We were supposed to go see The Notebook with Fionna and Christine but that didn't work out for the obvious reasons that my mom wanted to go look at comforters for my room? Oh well, that is more of a girly occasion anyways. Maybe we can plan that for today or something. *Hopefully!* Or see Spiderman 2...cuz I wanna see that too. Well, kind of. Anyways, yesterday was fun, too. We went over to Debster's house (we being me, Josh, Bret and Courtney) and we swam in her pool all day. That was pretty fun and I think I got a tan. lol, well kind of. It was really cute though because that was me and Josh's 9 MONTH ANNIVERSARY! HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO US!!!!!!! I LOVE JOSH!!!! lol as if you guys didn't already know. But yeah I called Megan after that because she wanted to know earlier in the day if I wanted to spend the night at her house, but she wasn't home, she was at the movies with B. So yeah, I continued learning Radio by Alkaline Trio. And I'm really good at now! Thanks to Josh, he taught me! :) But I love Alkaline Trio, and I love that song! And I really can't wait 'til Warped Tour when I can see them LIVE! Along with all those other wonderful bands that I want to see. lol. But yeah. The plans for today remain unplanned. I'm gonna call the girls and see if they want to do something. Hopefully that all works out and today I can actually get out of this bad mood. Cuz I am in a pretty depressed mood right now. I don't know what it is, but something is bringing me down like crazy. I think it's the lack of a drivers lisence. Maybe that's it. Or maybe it's just my psycho Nazi parents that are driving me insane. Which is exactly why I want to get out of the house. GOD! Alright, well this is getting long, so I better go. 
Love, Kristan"

Anyways for the past week i have been up in Caseville with Beggin Strips! lol (Megan). I have to say, it was pretty fun! except for the fact that I missed Josh SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much ... :( but yeah i'll tell you about my trip.

Saturday-We got there at like 7:30 or somethin like that and we just unpacked. I think we went out to ice cream too at this little cute place called shakers. We went out to ice cream a lot on that trip. lol! 

Sunday-I think we layed out by the pool a lot. yeah and then I went to the payphone and called josh because i missed him SO very much. I can't really remember what else we did...lol. Oh yeah, it was her little cousin Brandon's birthday and all their family came over. But it's cool cuz we stayed away from the family scene a lot and went to the pool and did our own thing which was nice. 

Monday-We layed out by the pool again and i got really sunburned. lol but it was all good cuz it turned into a tan and now i am a tan girl!

Tuesday-It was mine and Josh's 8 month and 3 week anniversary so i was thinking about him all day long and i HAD to call him. I think it was kind of stormy and overcast that day too so we stayed in a lot and watched movies. We also went out and saw Harry Potter too which was a pretty good movie, i must say! lol

Wednesday-We rented jetski's which was SO much fun. Megan and I got to ride our own jetski because she has her lisence now so she can drive her own. Man that was like 45 minutes of pure fun! lol it was great, even though the water was pretty cold. 

Thursday-We went to the mall and to these little shops in Port Austin. That was a lot of fun cuz i got to go shopping and get my baby a cd and stuff like that. it was good to get away from the chalet and stuff like that and get out and do something cuz it was kind of overcast that day. lol but omg that night we bugged katie sooo much and we listened to renegade by styx all night long! dude it was hilarious. 

Friday-We went to some more little shops with Megan's mom and grandma. Which was cute because I got to see a bunch of cute stuff in 'em. lol it was pretty fun. then we went out putt-putting which was hilarious. we cheated like crazy, but that's the fun in putt putt. lol! yeah idk what was wrong w/ me that day, but the end of the day was like massive depressiveness. I missed josh sooo much cuz i wasn't able to talk to him for 3 days cuz he was at camp. idk that day was just really hard for me. 

Saturday-We had to wake up really early and get packed. We were making fun of some girl next door that was the same age as me and Megan and went to school in Milford. Apperantly while she was on vacation there for a week, she met some really ugly kid who looked like a leperachaun and apperantly as her mom put it...""hit it off really well""...lol yeah you know what that means...SICK!!!!!! but yeah we got in the car and headed for home. (while making a stop at bigboys for some lunch on the way)

All in all, it was a pretty nice trip and I enjoyed myself. It was a nice getaway from the house and my family. 

But anyways, yesterday I went to Josh's hockey party w/ him at Bret's house. I had a really nice time w/ him and i missed him sooo much. But it kind of took a wrong turn in the beginning when apperantly Bret's mom thought we were making out or something and we really weren't. Idk, it was crazy and it all turned out that Josh ran off (i felt SOOO bad) and i was crying my eyes out to kirsten. I hate it when stuff like that happens. I love spending time with Josh, but I think that it just always turns out badly when we're around all of his parent's friends. But the evening turned out fine...we ended up running all over bret's neighborhood playing flashlight tag which was really fun...lol i felt like a little kid again. i haven't played that game in ages. But it was really fun. 

So now i'm just sitting here updating the livejournal and listening to alkaline trio. I have nothing else to do because Josh is supposed to be online talking to me right now and he's not! lol it's okay, maybe he's sleeping. AWWWWW I LOVE JOSH!!!!! and i miss him sooooo much. 

Well i should go now...I'll update later, maybe! lol!

Love Always,
Kristan!"

"event","lol holy shit i am finally updating my LJ! lol mostly cuz fionna wants me to and i wanna make her day! lol but so far, summer vacation has been kind of uneventful, the only thing that i've done so far is go to camp dearborn ( VERY SPUR OF THE MOMENT ) yesterday. it was a lot different than i thought it was gonna be but i met some of his friends and i got to see some of the CHICKS HE'S HOOKED UP WITH  who are very ugly and kind of fat might i add...but who's counting. lol. but yeah it was fun. 

but anyways i'm hoping to hook up with fionna today to maybe see a movie or somethin like that. cuz i miss her and i want to see her!!!!!!  so we're gonna see if we can't get together. cuz i haven't hung out w/ her since THURSDAY!!!!!! :'(

anyways i went to my sister's dance recital on friday?? yeah friday. i saw penky there and the girl matt's fucking. but i didn't see matt,he was probably there though. and i saw christine (penky's girlfriend) dance. that girl is really really good. she was in like every dance i saw so i got a good taste of her. lol but yeah.

im kind of excited to go back to school. kind of not. spring break's been kind of eventful. i've been so freaking busy though its not even funny. i've practiced every day this week for varsity for 3 hours. i feel used w/ the whole team experience because i feel like mr. gale doesnt care if we're there or not. we're just kind of extras. but whatever. i hung out w/ megan twice and we hung out w/ the soullieres which was a nice refreshing point of intrest. it was fun hanging out w/ megan for a change. i havent hung out w/ her in a while and it reminded me of why shes my best friend. 

speaking of best friends. fionna is definatly pissed at me. and i wish i could change that because i havent really done anything i dont think?????? i wish she would talk to me or call me or something. but i know shes pissed. i want to talk to her or call her or go down there and try to work things out but im so scared. im scared that she doesnt wanna be my friend anymore. but i hope thats not the case. GOD HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!! 

but yeah josh comes home tomorrow which is making me happy. i miss him soo soo much! :'(

"event","so i havent written in such a long time! but fionna thinks that i should write another entry so this is what im doing. 

well its officially spring break.
friday as soon as i got out of softball joshua called me from florida which made me very happy! *p.s. for all you stupid asses out there i miss him like CRAZY .... :'(* but i guess that me and megan are gonna be practicing w/ the varsity girls and we're gonna play in a game w/ them when we get back from break. im kind of excited but at the same time im just REALLY freaking nervous.

anyways i went over to courtneys house and hung out w/ her, megan, fionna and christine. it was so much fun! we ate TONS of food (lol fionna-) and i FINALLY SAW TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE! it was pretty scary and now im freaking obsessing over whether that scary dude is gonna come get me. but afterwards we went up in courtneys room and watched grind which is always a mood picker upper. lol that is the BEST MOVIE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD FOR ALL YOU STUPID ASSES THAT DIDNT KNOW IT! LOL! anyways we finally fell asleep around 4 or 3:30. well I earlier than courtney and fionna cuz they're CRAZY AND WANTED TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT ! lol love ya girls. anyway the next day we went to breakfast and it was really really really yummy. mmmmmm. lol but yeah after that we went to the mall w/ the exception of courtney who had to go to her vatti's house. :( but i got an outfit for easter so its all good. 
CHUCK CHUCK BO BUCK BANANA FANA FO FUUUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lol sorry random outburst

but yeah it was a lot of fun. then i went home and joshua called me again and we got to talk for like an hour and a half. i honestly didnt think that he'd be calling me as much as he has but obviously he misses me as much as i miss him!!!! :) which is a very good thing. 
anyways 
then me and my sister and my mom decorated easter eggs which was cute meine mutti is so adorable. i love her!!!!!!!!!
then my sister comes upstairs from getting online and its like 9 30 at night and shes like fionna wants to know if you wanna go glo bowling....lololol so i get ready and go glo bowling with fionna, kristin crider, kev the kevster and mike prud'homme. it was pretty fun!! kev the kevster is so cute! and so is mike. actually they're all so cute. 
but yeah then i went to bed and now im up listening to dashboard and all that junk. lol surprise surprise!
but yeah spring break has been damn good so far.
i love my girls. awwww!

"event","well i really haven't updated in a long time. quite possibly because you all know that my computer has been broken! woo hoo! lol yeah and plus now that we finally HAVE our new computer it is pretty sucky. oh well. im on it i guess. lol.

anyways, everything has been pretty stressful lately. drivers ed started two weeks ago and this week is my last week. im really pumped about that and today was my last day of driving. so i have my 6 hours of driving and observation in! ye-auhh! lol. and i made JV softball for all you dumbasses out there that didn't already know. lol yeah. that's like pretty stressful. im trying to find my throw again and my swing because apperantly summer ball screwed me up massively. but yeah its really hard. trying to find the time to actually DO something that i wanna do these days. I barely even have time to eat when i go home because i always have to be constantly going or doing something. crazy. but oh well i guess its good for me. anyways yeah.

but today was fun. its cute because courtney's friend debbie and fionnas little brother jack are going out! aww its adorable. im so happy for them. anyways they came over and fionna came over until she had to drive and joshua came over. it was a lot of fun. i miss josh though. of course lol im sure you guys dont wanna hear about me saying i miss josh. you all know the story on that one. lol ;)

anyways i got into a couple fights w/ my parents. which is a couple more then usual recently. i mean i guess conflict is good every now and then so we dont get too ""confident"" in each other or whatever. idk my parents are just weird like that. thats what i think is goin on. but i could be wrong. who knows. 

anyways im bored and a half. i hope you guys had fun reading my little thingy. lol i probably wont write again for a while unless i feel like it cuz the LJ just isn't doin it for me nemore like it used to! lol oh well. talk to you guys tomorrow. LOL

"event","fuck i havent updated in the longest ass time! but if you're wondering about the subject up there...fionna just showed me this nasty ass porno thing of two guys gettin it on and we both just about puked! seriously dude, hot dudes making out is perfectly fine and dandy in my world but UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD GUYS GO ANY FARTHER! seriuosly...just wrong.

so i think that i last updated the day of winterfest. or maybe the day before. it was sooo fun! we all had a really nice time. the decorations were really cute and the dj was pretty good. i took lotsa cute pictures *including the one of miles and fionna in which she absolutely glorifies* lol luv ya babes. but yeah all in all it was a really fun night. except for the fact that afterwards i couldnt go back to megan's house and spend the night w/ the girls. :( it was upsetting but im sure they had a good time anyways. 

nehoo not a hole lot has happened since. josh and i got together a few times in between that...well DUH! but last friday and saturday were fun. i hung out w/ josh and we FINALLY GOT TO GIVE EACH OTHER ACTION~!!!! lol after like 2 months of going without ANY i think we finally tided ourselves over. cuz after that me and fionna and josh and seemore pussy galore all went to the movies and i got MASSIVE action...we're talkin the best action in my entire life. but im sure you guys all know about that. lol i just had to exaggerate a little bit more on it. lol ;) but yeah so i think im tided over for a little while on the horniness.

man drivers ed started this morning. i woke up at fucking 4:15 in the morning and my dad drove me only so i could sit in a classroom full of 31 people and listen to a 50 year old dude talk about the stupid fundamentals of driving and stupid shit about the class for fucking 2 hours. and i have tons of damn projects due by the end of this week because my teachers are project nazis and wanna give 'em all out at the same time. GRR! plus on top of that...today is the first day of softball tryouts. i dont even WANT TO MAKE IT! seriously i have so much shit on my plate right now that softball is the last tiring thing that i need before i just pass out and never wake up. seriously im just gonna kill myself. >:( so yeah...

but yeah me and fionna are just sittin here in the library trying to get rid of our project that we have to memorize for gerlach's class. i swear that thing is kickin my ass SO badly. i just wanna kill gerlach sometimes. i mean she's a nice lady and all but just KILL ME ALREADY AND GET IT OVERWITH! GOD! oh well. but it looks like im gettin a lotta work done, doesnt it? yeah, i thought so too. maybe i should log out seeing as i pretty much updated you guys for a while.

and i might not update again for a while longer because my computers are blown. we're supposed to be getting new ones but that doesnt seem to be happening in the near future at all. oh well who cares. 

anyways i been kinda worried about josh these days. he seems really unhappy. like he's always in fights w/ his parents and he always wants to kill himself because of it. fionna and i were talking about it and she thinks that his parents just have a weird way of showing that they love him. but i think that its wrong for them to never tell him that they love him. i mean i know that they MUST but still. thats why i think that he is the way that he is and thats why he craves attention all the time. oh well i love him. i hope he starts feeling better...

oh yeah on saturday i spent the night at fionnas house. lol that was SO fun. we always have the greatest times together. love ya babes!

god i dont think my wrists have ever hurt from typing this much but i think its time to log out anyways. i'll try to update again soon but until then, tata! love you all! kissies! :)"

"event","well i talked to joshua last night. for a little while. im really excited about today. woo hoo! winterfest! but yeah 

i had this really weird dream. i keep having dreams that me and josh are cheating on each other or we are losing touch with each other. like josh stops liking me or something like that. i really do hope that its not a sign. like in my dream last night we went to winterfest and he was really annoying me and i was really annoying him. then he finally said that it wasnt working out between the two of us and we broke up. the thing was that in my dream i wasn't really sad at all. and when i woke up i almost cried. what the hell is that supposed to mean? if you people out there can interpret dreams, please help me cuz i definatly need it. 

but it was all just a dream and hopefully they'll go away or something. im sick of having bad dreams about the best boyfriend in the world. :( 

but today is good! my mom said that she would put really blonde highlights in my hair (making me a blonde again!! :D) and then she would give me a perm!! woo hoo! it took some huge convincing but shes gonna do it! and she said that she might put DARK BROWN highlights in my hair. ones that ALMOST look black but not quite. which is damn good enough for me cuz DUH nething close to black will work for me. so my hair's gonna be damn cool. HOT DAMN! lol kevin...that kid is hillarious.


so im wondering how lisa's party went. fionna was pretty pumped about the freaking 85$$ present that she got her! lol i hope they all had a good time. and i kind of feel bad for lisa cuz nobody was really gonna end up going. :( but hopefully that all works out for her. ya kno? of course you do. lol.

so anyways nobody is online and i am bored...so you all know what that means...QUIZILLA! lol! next entry i will probably be telling all of you about my LOVELY WINTERFEST EVENING!! WHATS UP!?!?!!!? LOL!

love all of you! HAPPY WINTERFEST!!!! :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:DD:D

"event","lol sorry i felt like i left things unsaid in my last entry! lol! nah...it was a really good day today.
i woke up and called my wonderful boyfriend and we chatted for a little while. then i picked out a really cute outfit and looked pretty damn cute today if i do say so myself. lol. so all the classes were shortened and the pep rally was today. which kind of sucked but it was alright. the sophomore skit was cuter than i had expected and a couple other skits were pretty funny. all in all it was a really good day cuz everyone was in a SUPER good mood including myself... lol fionna-we drank matts caribou coffee! lol funny stuff! but yeah it was a good day.

anyways i just got done painting my toe nails with courtney. they are light pink with semi sparkles on 'em. they dont look as good as i had planned but oh well...i guess things never do. but josh just dyed his hair black. well dark brown. he says that it looks black from a distance but shined in the light you can tell its dark brown. and he has to get it cut tomorrow. :( i am quite dissapointed. but oh well i will love him no less. because he is the best boyfriend in the world.

and i can wait until tomorrow! its gonna be a freaking blast. dude..........oh god im excited! lol. sorry. heres the schedule:

im gonna go to my momma's salon at idk what time. im gonna get my hair dyed blonde and then get an updo. and it better be cute cuz my one for homecoming kind of sucked. actually sucked big time. but its okay cuz its gonna look good this time! heck yeah!

so after that i'll probably call fionna and megan and see where everyone is. and i'll probably get all dressed up cuz i'll be at the salon most of the day. i'll get everything together and put my dress and stuff on and then i'll probably start dinner for josh.

josh will come over and we'll eat and take pictures and stuff like that and GO TO THE DANCE BABY!!!!! WOOO!!!!

after that we're gonna go to megans house and HECK YEAH ALL HELL WILL BREAK LOOSE! lol we're gonna have so much fun...

i cant freaking wait until tomorrow...oh god its gonna rock...

and now my wonderful boyfriend is back to talk to me! im outta here kids! love y'all! night night!"

"event","today was another day... this morning i woke up and my lovely boyfriend called me and we had another interesting conversation about our dreams...lol yeah they were crazy. then i got on the bus and fionna told me about her interesting dream which was QUITE interesting if i do say so myself...*lol fionna-mini me* LOL! then i got to school and nothing interesting happened there. i voted for winterfest king yesterday. DUH MILES THARP. i know he's gonna win and if he doesnt im just gonna be mad. and shoot whoever wins because they are not as worthy as miles. lol. anyway, nothing else good happened today. i had some more good conversation with fionna on the bus this afternoon, but whats new there...lol we ALWAYS have funny conversations. 

last night fionna and caitlyn came over. fionna showed me her shoes and her dress and all her stuff for winterfest. she looks SO good! she's gonna look awesome at the dance. i just know it! :) speaking of the dance, tomorrow is friday! which means that is the pep rally and the next day is the dance!! WOO HOO! :D! HOT DAMN! lol 

so now i'm listening to some billy talent. which is cool cuz i love billy talent. adam licked pussy galore burned me Deja Entendu by Brand New today. im pumped. i listened to it briefly in 6th hour and i still think that Your Favorite Weapon is better. lol which is also what this Pam girl thought too. She's a cool girl and i've always wanted to talk to her. lol she's a freshman and shes SO punk its awesome! :D lol i should make friends...lolol im a weirdo...

anyhoo...as fionna will predict...this is my josh section! lol! i hate looking at happy couples in the hallways. it makes me SO mad. and most people will say well at least you HAVE a boyfriend! well you know what? having a boyfriend that doesn't go to your school is worse than not having a boyfriend at all. cuz at least when you dont have a boyfriend you dont know what you're missing. i think about josh ALL the time in school and i never get to see him. all kids who have a boyfriend/girlfriend at south lyon high school: treasure what you have because some people are A LOT LESS FORTUNATE THAN YOUR SPOILED SELF! so yeah. lol i miss josh. 

tomorrow is friday! YESSSSSSSSSSSSS! :D!

oh by the way....courtney stoker!!! i love you!!! lol i have your socks for you...i will wash them for you but i know that you will not want me to because my beautiful feet were in them. lol luv ya babe

"event","so today was kind of uneventful. it all started with fionna. i guess her and courtney and christine were having a bit of confusion and contrevoursy in which i gladly stayed out of. but im glad its all over now. cuz its sad when people. :( i know all about it. 

anyways this whole scheduling business is WAY too much more trouble than its worth. today i had to wait in line 15 minutes before school only to listen to stupid ms. godo tell me that i had to come back after school. then i had to listen to ms. b bitch more at me and tell me to go down to the office cuz i didnt have it done. so i went down there and listenend to ms. b bitch s'more afterwards cuz i didnt drop it off at the right place. oh well shes stupid. but all of that is done and overwith and hopefully all the drama that comes with it is overwith too. 

nehoo the rest of the day kind of dragged on. well good thing today is wednesday. cuz that means that tomorrow is thursday and the next day is friday! and then the next day is SATURDAY WHICH MEANS WINTERFEST! i am sooo freaking excited. i went to fionnas house last night and it was the BEST! lol we always have so much fun together! yes fionna this is gonna be a LARGE section about you and i !!! lol !!! well i got there and caitlyn so generously burned me the billy talent cd and nick burned me chevelle and HIM. which rocks cuz im listening to HIM right now !! woo hoo !! so then fionna and i got dressed up like fREAKS and went down to my house to pick up my dress and went back to her house and danced around her room for the longest time cuz ..... chya......we're rockstars!!! lol!! *octopus feet* lol! *i wanna...li-li-li-lick you from yo head to yo toes!* lol great times girl! love ya! :D 

lol and oh yeah fionna and i started off having a quite clean conversation about HIM on the bus.....but you CANT end up having a clean conversation when it starts off with HIM. lol DUH! so we had a really really long talk about our sex lives *or lack there of* lol and we were thinking about how painful the first time will be.....OUCH! but very very interesting...lol of course! fionnas the best...

nehoo i just cant wait until winterfest. i just realized how annoying my dress is gonna be dancing around in it last night. oh well i'll hopefully look cute so maybe that'll make up for it. lol! sweeeeeeeet. nehoo moving on...i havent really done anything else today...

i miss josh and i havent seen him since monday. which considering the fact that we've had school isnt too bad but still. i love him! and listening to HIM is making me miss him soemthing terrible...these lyrics are soo o o o o cute! aww! 

plus ville valla *spelling is wrong and i know it...lol* is HOTT! lol josh is hotter...of course! lol

"event","so today was quite uneventful. as usual.
this morning fionna and i were both in a little bit of a bad mood so there was some tension on the bus. but i mentioned something right of the bat and everything seemed to be okay the rest of the day. im glad it was brought out in the open though. i wouldnt be able to STAND her being mad at me. or being in a fight.

so all these winterfest plans were practically screwed in the face yesterday. seriously im so confused on what to do. i mean i wanna hang out w/ the girls but i wanna have this winterfest dinner be special with josh. and i think we decided last night that we were just gonna be alone. which will be okay cuz i'll be hangin w/ everybody at the dance anyways. but i hope everything works out okay. 

anyways i am very pumped for this weekend. me and fionna are gonna make up a dance like on grind when they go to the club and their song comes on and they do that wicked dance. lol we're gonna be so cool. even tho fionna is convinced that we wont do it. lol we are SO gonna. lol !!! anyways im goin down there tonight 2 see whats goin on. lol cuz we always have so much fun together! :D love ya sweetie!

lets see... what else happened today...

oh yeah! last night i went to matt soulliere's hockey game with megan, josh and bret eventually showed up. oh yeah kirsten was there too. and bret's sister and her friend. lol it was quite a crowd. i tried calling fionna to come with us but i couldnt get a hold of her. :( it just wasnt the same. but it was fun nonetheless. we hung out w/ matt and kirsten for a little while until josh showed up and we watched the game and watched him and bret skate and stuff like that. its fun when we're all just chillin together and we really have nothing important to do. sometimes thats when i have the most fun. becaues nothing is actually planned and we're just playin it by ear. good stuff. i must say. 

anyways everyone's goin to lisa's birthday party on friday. i dont have anything to do. wait, lemme see...hmm...lol this should be a given. im probably gonna hang out with my boyfriend! lol man o man i am good. lol! 

nehoo im trying to convince my mom to give me pink highlights on saturday when she does my hair for winterfest. maybe i'll just ask her to do the wash out crap cuz it'll ""match my dress"" lol yeah that'll be my excuse. and maybe some black cuz that would just plain rock. dont you guys think? well agree with me because i know my shit.....lol

well im gonna go now cuz im BORED and nobody is online.....

anyways, today was fair. i miss josh a LOT. apperantly fionnas having some hard times with the winterfest plans and people are shootin her down for it. which is gay. she deserves so much more credit than that. and when people dont give that girl credit it just makes me mad. i love you fionna. 

anyways i hope everything works out good for winterfest this weekend. because im sooo excited. but the plans keep changing. who knows. we'll probably just end up going to mcdonalds or something. LOL that would be hillarious. anyways, theres really nothin for me to say.....lol ttyl.....

idk why.

i miss josh SO much. yesterday kind of sucked. i mean i got to spend time with fionna and megan and that was cool we chilled for a little while and fionna spent the night which was fun. 

but dude, my parents are so fucking gay. they wouldnt drive me anywhere yesterday. it seems like they're fucking driving nazi's or something. i mean josh's parents are willing to tote me around half way around the fucking world half the time and its freaking embarassing. its gay because my parents are always like ""oh yeah its not fair that josh's parents have to do all the driving all the time"" well then WHY DONT YOU GUYS FUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEN!? HELLO! its not that freaking hard! and it sucks because then i dont get to see josh as much! we've only seen each other two days and yesterday doesnt even count cuz we barely seen each other for a half hour. god damn. i hate this crap. i cant wait until i can drive cuz then i'll NEVER be home and i will be okay with that. 

i miss josh a lot. he has a hockey tournament today and tomorrow so its a fat chance that we're gonna be able to see each other. which is freaking gay. and on top of all that i dont feel good. i have a soar throat and some sinus crap going on.

fionna and me might go to the mall today. which better work out cuz if i dont get to do anything on friday then i better freaking be able to go shopping. i will freak out if i dont.

alright sorry for bitchin to you guys. its just all gay. 

fuck it"

"event","well im babysitting right now and sitting downstairs on these people's computer. its good because the 2 year old is asleep and the 7 year old is at her friend's house for the day. which means free access to whatever i want whenever i want for the whole day! and the best part is...this is the last day that i have to babysit! woo hoo! start with hell...end with not so much. lol! and 72 bucks which isnt too bad! i mean its not 2 good considering the HELL that i was put through yesterday, but its good enough. lol ! 

anyways last night was great. i hadn't seen josh in like 10 or 11 days which we all know is AWFUL for me. so i went to his hockey game. i love him so much. and i miss him like crazy right now. plus i am like...going crazy for some action. actually i cant decide whether im in the cucdly mood lately or the action getting mood. its half n half. lol. gotta be the pms. lol. 

anyways, its thursday on break and i still havent done anything extraordinary. break is supposed to be awesome and its alright so far...but nothing special. oh well. tomorrow my dress is coming in the mail for winterfest and im freaking PUMPED as hell cuz its freaking awesome. you guys will have to see it! woo hoo! :) 

so yesterday i guess fionna and courtney went to courtney bregars house. which doesnt exactly sound like a party to me because i dont like her as much as the rest of 'em do, but im glad that they had fun. lol.....and now fionna and i are gonna have to up the standards of this competition of ours...or lower them...lol whichever one you wanna say...LOL

so ms.time of the month decided to grace me yesterday. and my sexual frusteration couldnt be worse! you know, this always happens to me. oh well i guess i will just suck it up and deal with it. lol after all it doesnt last THAT long. ;)

anyways....

FIONNA: TELL ME THIS STORY! I AM GOING CRAZY OVER HERE!!  and yeah i'm talking to don right now. he told me that his girfriend broke up with him. :( poor kid. did you know that his parents are getting a divorce too? i feel soo bad for him. poor kid. we're gonna have to hang out w/ him this weekend and make him feel better. (non sexually...lol) BUT YOU ARE GOING TO TELL ME THIS STORY THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BRETTY AND YOU ARENT POSTING IN YOUR JOURNAL!!!!!!!!!!!! 

anyways today i woke up......and havent done anything since. lol we rode our snowmobile for a little while and i think we're gonna get some pizza soon.

but i cant help thinking about josh. its been 8 days since i've seen him. im gonna cry. but i'll try to hang on until i see him next. hopefully soon. :(

tuesday i might go get a winterfest dress w/ my mom. and then my dad said that we might be able to go into novi and look at some snowboarding stuff. heck yeah man im so pumped! lol. anyways i gotta go now. more later.

"event","so im at the grandparent's house because we're SUPPOSED to be up here. its gay. oh well. 

snowboarding was awesome. im getting a lot better than i was. i'm soooo pumped. the trip wasn't as bad as i thought it was gonna be though. we got there on friday night and we bounced around for a little while until i finally just passed out listening to brand new. of course whats new there, i'm like obsessed with brand new all of a sudden. so then on saturday morning we woke up and went snowboarding all day. it was awesome but i did something crazy to my knee and it looks like shit. it hurts like a bitch too. oh well. sunday we woke up and did a little cleaning, packed up and then snowboarded until about 4:30 when we packed up and drove to the grandparent's house. and thats where i am right now. i guess its kinda cool that i've been getting a chance to finally bond w/ my family that has been long needed i guess. but im glad because TOO much family bonding can be like...life wrecking..im tellin ya. lol. anyways, i really miss josh. i havent seen him since last sunday. thats about a week. i need to see him. enough said. 

and im wondering how fionnas doin. i know she said that she was gonna get together w/ bret but who knows how that went.lol. maybe we'll all get together this week. which should happen cuz i wanna hang out w/ fionna. and getting all four of us together again would be fun. we havent done that in a while. so hopefully that gets to happen.

anyways, im about beat. my legs hurt and im soar all over. i think im gonna go listen to a little josh groban. that always gets me in a good mood. or a sleepy mood. or an italian emo mood. whichever one comes first. lol. c you guys later!

Even though I'm not supposed to write a lot of stuff about Josh in here...*cough cough MATTHEW MASSUCH* lol I have to tell about my night!

So Josh came over and we had fun! Not sexual fun for all you dirty minded people out there. Just fun. I love being with him. 

Anyways, I hope that all the plans work out for today. Me, Fionna, Bret and Josh are all supposed to go to Emagine or something and use Matthew Massuch's car. *LOL!* So hopefully that works out because ONE MORE DISSAPOINTMENT with my parents cancelling my plans, and I'm gonna go PSYCHO! And I do mean PSYCHO! 

I need to start dieting...I'm getting a little on the heavy side. Well not necessarily heavy, but I'm gaining the weight back that I lost when I went on the diet the first time. So as much as Fionna says that I'll just keep putting it off...which I can understand because I HAVE BEEN...lol...I will start dieting either today or tomorrow. Mark that. lol. 

Anyways I have to go get ready for church. Hopefully the plans work out.

"event","i IM'd griffen on a monday and asked him if he wanted to go to he ANUAL ""phillip baileys: FANTA-SHE's""..... and he said yes and i was HAPPY i offered to pay and he said SURE and so i got ready a t 5 pm and got to the  GRIND a gay owned coffee shop and we walked to the RIVERSIDE MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM and bought our illegal tikets ( ill talk about that later...) and sat on the steps and i told jokes we talked about personal stuff,and then we got in to the balcony area haha we snuck in kind of and never got our tikets ripped or cheked haha it was great!!! we then saw the show.
  The main reason we went to the show was this guy i have had a HUGE crush on since my freshman year in high school (goin on 5 years now) was peforming in it as a fanta shes dancer boy, and my DIVA carlos was a stage crew guy so i ahd to go see it MOSTLY  for sean ( my crush ) the BEST impersonators were the DIANA ROSS, bette midler and christina agulera, at intermisson i saw carlos and hugged him and talked to him told him to see me after the show hehe, then i ATTEPMTED to talk to sean FINALLY after 5 years haha and i got the brush off and figured out that i WAS  sitting NEXT to RU PAUL CHARLES,(actually 5 1/2 seats my stuff was on the 5th seat haha ) and he wlaked backstage.
  Then the show continued and we hada a blast MADONNA kicked ass and after the show we walked down stairs and saw a few drag queens, a few were REALLY preatty and i talked to one of them, it was great. then i had to go potty and i went and when i came back down i saw sean ( i thought) leaving, but griff told  me he said he was putting stuff away and was coming back, and he did, we talked i got his number and was told he would totally liek to hang with me sometime and to call ANYTIME.i almost had an anurism,or  a heartattack im not sure, and then we went home and i asked griff if he would go clubbing with me on my 18th birthday and he said yes so i am planning my costume for the night it is on the VIP ((gay club) costume contest/party night so it all works out!!! all in all i think i had the BEST NIGHT of my life BETTER than seeing madonna live  and that says a lot"

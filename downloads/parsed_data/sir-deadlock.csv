"event","I was wondering what processes could be used in other areas, and then this one hit me.
 For those that watch Futurama (Matt Groaning), this method was applied to the robot Bender when he received a patch that would allow him to happily coexist with a newer more advanced robot.

 As you should know, pasteurization is the act of super heating a product and then chilling it back down rapidly. This act kills harmful bacteria and prolongs the life of said product.
 The act of mental pasteurization would involve forcing a mind to cope with living an entire life, and then returning to the previous youthful body.

 The result would be that all the healthy habits, quality social skills, and general betterment one gets in a lifetime would be deposited (mostly in physical memory) into the body that started the process in the first place. Hopefully this would put an end to &ldquo;youth is wasted on the young&rdquo; because the mental cycle would start young, become old, and then become young again. I&rsquo;m reminded of The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy regarding an race of creatures which were constantly evolving. The race was indignant to other races because &ndash; frankly &ndash; they&rsquo;d been everything, and as such were in perfect right to give criticism.

 Another thought that would support this process, is that it seems people are designed to adapt well to the process already.
 As people grow old it&rsquo;s as if they prepare to be a child again.

  I imagine it would be an odd sensation if the world we exist in is truly more like The Matrix, and we are simply interacting with other users. Certain ailments might be explained by their reflecting preprogrammed choices. A person born without a functional leg may on the outside have lost a leg, and it was decided their education would be better if learning how to cope with the lack of bipedal movement would be more beneficial than learning to dance with two legs.

 So how could the process be done? I&rsquo;m no biochemist, so I don&rsquo;t know. I think it would first involve analyzing the fragility of the patient&rsquo;s mind, gauging if they could handle the shock of living another life and then coming out of it. Then it would involve creating hypnotic or subconscious stabilizers to store and unlock one&rsquo;s identity. One&rsquo;s brain would have to become strengthened chemically to survive the memory acid flood. The mind would have to be monitored at higher than usual speed as the actual process would feel like years but take less than 2 or 3 months. For optimal results, there would have to be a gate system (like with sheep) to keep one&rsquo;s mind from going the wrong direction.

 I&rsquo;m reminded of the scene from Total Recall (Arnold Schwarzenager) where he was selecting a mental vacation which I assume uses the same technology, but for more of a recreational purpose.

 Hm&hellip; thinking about it, maybe this idea isn&rsquo;t so groundbreaking after all."

I'm in a Culinary Arts & Hospitality program, under Chef Wasson.

 *eats oatmeal with cream* yummy ^_^, I baught a 50 lb. bag of thick rolled oats, I'm a bit hesitant to open it, but I know I gotta, I'm afraid of it going bad before I finish it all, but I dunno. I just opened a 20 lb. bag of rice last night, I cooked some in a pan on the stove, it turned out nice. I've gotten into the habbit of adding soy sauce (non-alcoholic) to water I use to boil stuff like pasta and rice and other grainy things. It's been tasting great.... so I'm kinda worried it might be bad for me, atleast by salt content.

well, I'm late for school and I gotta brush my teeth. c'ya"

"event","sirdeadlock: I need to vent
sirdeadlock: are you available?
babadarma: I'm here young one
sirdeadlock: or are you going to sleep soon?
babadarma: no
babadarma: I'm awake
sirdeadlock: so the day started out feeling odd, I don't know why exactly. I woke up at 2:30 am 3:30 am and then 4:30 am.
I stayed awake at 4:30 and started to do my morning thing. I seemed to stall in a good chunk of time for what seemed like 15 mins, I was just standing there...
sirdeadlock: at breakfast I had my regular bowl of the grain group and some raisins
sirdeadlock: but I also made blueberry-buttermilk pancake batter, I made a few fancakes and mom made the rest
sirdeadlock: lately I've been using the phrase ""these things happen"" to get past my mistakes, but it doesn't really make me feel any better
sirdeadlock: I've been accepting too many rides from my mom, and that's been dampening my self worth
sirdeadlock: *takes deep breath*
babadarma: *good*
sirdeadlock: on the way to school I fell asleep in the car
sirdeadlock: I was ashamed that I couldn't keep myself awake
sirdeadlock: of late I've just been nodding off in class, as much as I don't want to
sirdeadlock: I try to stay awake and it doesn't work
sirdeadlock: so basicl I'm behind in my reading, I can find quick answers but I think the real point is that I learn something
babadarma: yes
sirdeadlock: so pretty much I'm not learning more than important sounding tid-bits
sirdeadlock: like caremelle is extremely unhealthy
sirdeadlock: and rice attracts a certain bacteria
sirdeadlock: in ten hours a billion or more cells of bacteria can grow
sirdeadlock: durring the food lab I was pretty much awake, but I was just drifting
sirdeadlock: I seem to be most awake when I'm on my feet or doing something physical
sirdeadlock: my homework is less dominating, but still difficult
sirdeadlock: I'm afraid of messing up and causing somebody to get sick
babadarma: I am convinced that when  you take a sleep apnea test you may get a machine and be able to be more awake
sirdeadlock: when I got out of class I headed out and found somebody waiting for a ride, her name is Anny... I think. she's 17 and good with conversations. so then I started walking to counseling
sirdeadlock: about a quarter of the way there I realized I didn't have my watch with me, so I walked back stressing a little bit, I asked around and it wasn't there
sirdeadlock: so I just went to counseling
sirdeadlock: I knocked on the door and a lady opened it, she got laura for me (I was a lil' late)
sirdeadlock: durring a good portion I was kinetic
babadarma: kinetic=moving around?
sirdeadlock: meaning I thought I said much more than I really did, my appendages moved less than I meant them to
sirdeadlock: pyscho-kinetic?
sirdeadlock: it's an odd feeling to try and move limbs, and it feels as though you are, but they don't move
sirdeadlock: so to make a long story short she sent me home early and was glad to know that I'd mostly be taking the bus home
sirdeadlock: I took the greenwood ave unless of fremont's or whatever it is
babadarma: shall I call you?
babadarma: hello???
babadarma is idle at 10:30:47 PM. 
babadarma is no longer idle at 10:30:57 PM. 
sirdeadlock: and the result of that was I walked past our mail-man's truck, and he saved time of going up 3 flights of stairs by handiong me a package for us
sirdeadlock: well, for josh
sirdeadlock: from there I did a little ""ninja boy! *swishes tube like a sword and then be's responsible for it's safety*""
sirdeadlock: it was a nice sunny warm day
sirdeadlock: so the walk home was a bit enjoyable
babadarma: *-*
sirdeadlock: I imagined what it would be like if instead of all the concrete it was just dirt roads and trails, and I got an image that resembled a scene from spririted away, but I also imagined there were more trees, green trhings and wildlife, the sun came down in packs and never truely blinds you
sirdeadlock: it was a comforting though to think of all those pretty green leafed trees
sirdeadlock: the reddish browny and slightly yellow and black stanbark/dirt/soil trails and thick roads
sirdeadlock: a tunnel created between the trees
sirdeadlock: beautiful
sirdeadlock: so anyway, I walked up the stairs in packs of 2 at a time
babadarma: *-*
sirdeadlock: when I got home I said hi to josh, and ate the leftover blueberry pancakes
sirdeadlock: then I had some leftover re-heated bean and veg soup I made
sirdeadlock: I added some left-over cream (from when I made fresh butter
babadarma: YUMMMM
sirdeadlock: so after that, I know I shouldn't have so soon after eating, but I fell asleep and didn't wake until it was 6 PM
babadarma: you needed the sleep
sirdeadlock: my eyes were dry, my mouth had the after taste of salad cream, and I didn't enjoy my sleep
sirdeadlock: I wobbled around a little and then rinsed the dishes and loaded the dishwasher
sirdeadlock: brb
babadarma: the problem of sleep apnea is that a little flap of tissue in your throat - a valve - shuts down and causes you to stop beathing
babadarma: but your body wakes up enough to start breathing again.  Your conscious mind does NOT awake..so people are unaware that they are not sound asleep
babadarma: My breathing stopped 35 times per hour..that is why I get so sleepy
babadarma: I do need to go to sleep now Scott..Have a good day tomorrow!  gnglily:-*
Auto response from sirdeadlock: I am away from my computer right now.

sirdeadlock: so pretty much the rest of the night comes to I did dishes, and slapped myself hard in sections of three and did around 30 individual slaps
babadarma: slaps??
sirdeadlock: I found that I can take a hit, but when I'm hit three times in the same area I start to cry
babadarma: you hit yourself?
sirdeadlock: so I had a good 5-10 minute cry
sirdeadlock: and now and then I'd slap myself again
sirdeadlock: yes, I hit myself
babadarma: nooooooo  don't hit yourself..that is almost like Kelsie cutting
sirdeadlock: indeed
sirdeadlock: it didn't help with stress, I guess it was just something to do
babadarma: well don't do it anymore ok?
sirdeadlock: no, I'll do it again
babadarma: why??
sirdeadlock: it's something I do without thinking
sirdeadlock: or something I do when thinking
sirdeadlock: or when trying to be funny
sirdeadlock: or just to punish myself for small things
babadarma: not funny..never funny
sirdeadlock: it hurts...
sirdeadlock: I really have no good reason to do it
sirdeadlock: does hat mean it's fun?"

"event","so today is saturday, it started out pretty well actually. I woke up early, went through my morning routine in less than 2 hours, then I had breakfast while I made some cookies (I added way too much sugar>_<). then it was off to tae kwon do for my saturday work out, a few people ate the cookies I brought, I got nothing but good reviews (ok, not true, a few people thought they were too sugary). after I got home I couldn't tear myself away from snacking on sesame sticks and wasabi peas! I did this while playing <a href=""http://www.wilddivine.com/"">Journey to Wild Devine</a> (it's a game about meditation and what-not.

so after that I looked for kelsie on diablo for like 5 hours (I also leveled my sorceress four levels). after that I pretty much just played Dance Dance Revolution for the rest of the day (except when I got the mail for mom) until josh came home and took me off.
he was very nice about it, then he came in and told me I was stomping, and that it messes up the pad, and how because he's just borrowing it, I shouldn't go so hard on it. he was very nice about it, even about how I messed with the options.

then when liesl came over she was really... what's that word? agrivated that I had stomped on her expencive dance mat and messed with her options.
I know she was trying to be nice about it cause she seemed very tense. you know, that feeling when you're so annoyed with somebody you just wanna slap'em. so I'm pretty glad she was so nice about it.
then when I was in josh's room I couldn't help but step along with him (off any mat of course) and again they said I was stomping! I swear I didn't notice! on some songs, like the really fast ones I have to bring my feet down faster than normal, so I can understand why I might be stomping.

well, I mailed kelsie a box full of some stuff I thought might be usefull to her (most of it won't make ANY sense to her at all.

something I've noticed about girls is that they hate when you appologize fro everything, but what am I supposed to do? break something and hide it?

... I've got DDR commands stuck in my head and sugar stuck in my blood -_-
so many snacks, it's just unhealthy>_<.
I need to do more things to work all this junk off!

well, I think I'll brush my teeth, take out contacts, ect., and go to bed. I've got a big lump on my left ankle from accidently kicking somebody's elbow it sparring class(they did alot of good blocks btw), and a stretched toe from not raising my feet enough when I was running. I Saul's mom barrow one of my books (the tao of pooh) and I hope she keeps it safe (I don't even know when she's gonna return it, but I trust her).

oh man can I stretch this stuff, LIKE PIZZA DOUGH I SAY, THE DOUGH IS SO STRETCHY!

so yeah.... bye"

I was telling how to tick kelsie off, and I was going into detail and I went much to far!
I talked about something seriousely private, and I said it wrong.
kelsie won't forget this, why is it that like every 6- 8 months I find a way to really hurt her...
if she reads this (I believe she's angry but still caring at all times... but still, I really hurt her), I want her to know I feel awful, I wish I didn't say it, and I know I went to far.
you have permission to: delete my diablo chars, kick me out of the clan, say you hate me as much as you want, only talk to me when I'm not a jerk, steal my money, get pissed off your ass. and of course you have permission to kill me, in case you're interested I got a new set of knives you can use, they're very sharp."

so it's been a long time since kelsie talked to me, I think it's been two weeks?
it's excusable though, she's going through a really hard time right now, if I was there, I'd try to make a pizza for her.

the most recent pic I have of her was taken in february and is posted on <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/liquidphoenixclan/KelsiesPage.html"">her website</a> so you can see it's not a great pic.

I rode down the street to freddy's to get more conditioner, I think I do better at tae kwon do whenever I do a really long ride, like 30 minutes.
speaking of tae kwon do, everybody seems to like me now! ... it's a bit creepy, I just want them to stop complementing my work; I braught a couple pizzas on thursday, took me 2.46 hours to make... around there. I showed up late but they forgave me.
anyways, today I did really good, but durring the bike ride I worked up some gas >_< and it didn't come out till I was at tae kwon do, luckily it didn't come out where anyone could smell it.

I got complements on my kicking form, but it still needs alot of work, and my yellow belt form needs ALOT more work. my kicks are much to slow, and when I spar I have trouble strategizing and thinking.

trissy, I know you're gonna read this, so here's my last comments on the subject, I'll try to stay away from it from now on. whatever I've ben like in the past, I like you now, don't let me ruin my future with you cause of old habbits.

I took a 3 hour bike ride and I came home like just over 2 hours ago.
I went all the way down fremont, and then it just seemed to disappear into phinny, I found out that at the end of fremont ave. is greenlake, it was beautiful today.
I found a fish & chips place, I asked for a menu (they only had the big one behind the counter) so I asked if they had anything I could take home ""we have a business card, but I think that's about it."" and I said ""that'll work^_^"" and I got a card from them, then I stopped at this other place and got a menu from them. I checked out a bike store, but I was too embarrassed to ask if they could do a maintanence check for my bike.
on the way home my bike started making strange noises [I think it's mad cause I said we'd go to a bike shop today and I didn't] so I decided I'm gonna clean it this evening or tomorrow morning. then I'll lube it's chain, it's gotten so dirty.
I went up a really steepish hill and got onto where phinny and grenwood ave. connect (I thought of getting a menu there and then thought ""nah, kelsie has one, and I never eat there anymore"". so I rode down the sidewalk, I stopped at the bakery outlet, I've only seen two brands of hazlenut bread. they had a bag of 13 bean soup mix, I wanted to get it, but I'm glad I didn't. when I went to Bartel's and turned in the film, they let me call mom, she said 4X6 would be fine, and she wanted chocolate.
I looked at just about every chocolate they had, even cooking, cookies, candy bars, truffles, chocolate bars, those solid chocolate balls that you smack on things, toblerone, just about everything, there are two common ingredients in them all:
""soy lecithin (as an emulsifier), vanillin (and artifitial flavour)""
so I just grabbed what looked healthiest and then some junk:-P
I did try to stay away from partially hydrogenated oils though.
so then on the way home from THERE I stopped at subway for a drink, and then finally I went all the way home. I got upstairs and mom was happy to see me."

"event","ok, so right now I'm at the school computer lab, I'm gonna go read in a bit, but I'd like to say some stuff first.

something that's been on my mind is that josh said at one point, kelsie said she doesn't care about me or the way I feel and she's starving for attention (it came out to that anyway).
so I'm looking at kelsie's pics on www.geocities.com/liquidphoenixclan/ and I'm wondering ""does she really not care, did she even say that? it makes me wonder about her, josh's word is pretty credible.
kelsie hasn't talked to me in about 2 or 3 weeks, oh well, saturday and sundays only.
I think about her and... I don't know, it's just not the same as it used to be.

me and trissy are still friends, not much to say anymore, but she's there if I ever need to talk to someone.

josh is back home, he bought this pencil drawing thing in arizona, and I want one too.
for breakfast I made vegan pancakes (I think). they didn't contain eggs or milk products (soy milk, but it's not from an animal). I added cinnamon and raisins, they were tasty. I feel fat now.

hey kelsie, if you're reading this, hi.

I've been showing my **** on cam, I guess the only reason I do it is cause I like the attention.
some guy who I was chatting with last night said I should get a second profile under the SN Lady_deadlock I thought it sounded like a pretty cool name, but I don't wanna attract guys.

ok, well I think I'll get back to school stuff now.

bye everybody!

I know that getting rest is very important, but he said he'd help me!
I need to get my contacts and he said he's drive me... my other option is either the bus or walking.
apart from the I'm not entirely sure if my wrist is just dprained or if it's more seriouse than than, I can't really bend it more than about half an inch to an inch.

I called school and said I won't be showing up today 'cause I sprained it.

I just don't know what to do :'(

I guess I should start walking to northgate or catch a bus, then I can hit the 75 and go to children's to have my wrist looked a instead of diagnosed over the phone.

I need to ask mom to teach josh how to get to children's.... damn it! he already knows, the bg liar, I remember him driving me home not only from there but driving me from home TO there!
maybe he just doesn't think it's too seriouse.
it's prbably nothing but I want a docter or at least a nursse to look at it for me and be sure if it's just....
I'm so stressed >_>

I hope josh gets his sleeping times back on track. it's tough right now, a legal adult is in my house, but he's asleep for reasons beyond his current control

it's not his fault though.
oh well, bye"

"event","I took a GED test today, the results are with me yet, but they'll show up eventualy.
I took mathematics nd reading skills.
I'm sure I'll pass reading, but I think I'll get a lower score on math.

when I was at the shoreline buss stop sugiharto was there, we had a bit of a laugh just talking (he hasn't been to tae kwon do since he broke his hand). he got a nice blue cast (no writing or anything on it)
turns out I do know somebody who goes to shoreline:-)

since I had to leave my bike at school I was given bus tokens so I could go back and get it.

I have a slight sore throat, but it gets better throughout the day.

last night I sent kelsie some info on my diet (but I modified it so she could better fallow it), what I left out is about eggs:
try to limit yourself to one egg a day.

ok, well I'm gonna eat oatmeal with raisins and carobs.

"event","today was awsome!

first kelsie talked to me about all the stuff she's been doing with matt *chuckles*
then I get to class on time, I got throuygh a round-robin sparing thing (I've gotten lots better at moving around).
then at the end of class Austin's mom gave us king cake in honor of mardi gras, and I got beads too!(no, I didn't take off my top)

then it was such a perfectly sunny day that I went to the library and picked up some stuff (rush hour 2, spirited away)

then I come home to kelsie's old messages that went like:

sirdeadlock (10:17:18 AM): I owe kiri more than 10 bucks. she cared lots for me when I was there, I love her
Darling Angel KK (11:21:42 AM): u gotta have mental issues if ya love kiri
Auto response from sirdeadlock (11:21:42 AM): I am away from my computer right now.
Darling Angel KK (12:16:40 PM): back  yet

but when I opened the door josh was putting on his undies! hahahahaha!
now I'm like, I wanna get josh a cold turkey sub and me some pizza and... IT'S SUCH A PERFECT PICNIC DAY!

I wish kelsie and matt were here, they'd be so happy
I so want to buy a pizza and eat it outside

p.s. I gold big gold beads and you don't!!!"

"event","today I totaly finished part of a project at school, I'm almost done with that bit.

I was really really late for school, I showed up a like 10:47 am.
on the upside I found that mixing some carobs and raisins into my oatmeal tastes real nice.

this whole fractured pinky thing really makes washing my hair tough, with the whole hand inside a plasic bag thing. I put a rubber band around my wrist twice to try and keep the water out, but that eventualy starts to hurt, what does this mean?: a) STOP USING A RUBBER BAND IDIOT! b) Take faster showers.

for lunch I had some toast with hummus, homemade garlic bread (that garlic was strong) and then pasta with tomato sauce and a little bit of cheese, I also snacked on a few raisins.

at tae kwon do I also showed up late cause I took a nap and had to use the b-room *embarrassed* but that's nothing comparred to the garlic flavor I had in my mouth.

so when I got to class they were past the running and already were into stretching, because I was so behind I thought ""do your own stretching"" so I did, and it turned out pretty well.
I remember before I went to change into my dobak a little girl named Madison asked if she could draw in my art book, I said "" of course, anytime"" (to be honest I donated it the the class but they probably think it's mine cause I'm usually the only one who uses it). I hope I spell her name right: Dannielle and her... I think he's her dad, his name is Gilbert, they were at he adult class, and so was bill (Gilbert and Bill show up sometimes, but I've only seen Danielle in OUR class like two times before).

Danielle (Dan-yell) is really good at moving around, and she's gentle (she didn't kick me back 4 feet like niel does) but her biggest flaw is that she... is the phrase ""selling yourself short""? she's really good and has tons of pottential, but she needs a lil' confidence boost.
after class when we were all sweaty and stuff, she shocked me by saying ""My 12 year-old body can't take this."" or something like that, I was like
""you're 12?! I thought you were at least 13."" see, she's like 5'7 so I thought she was older.
a few things that stop me from asking people from class out on dates:
1. I doubt anybody'd wanna go on a date with me.
2. when I first started going here, sir said it was like I had been adopted into a family, therefore if I dated somebody it would be like going on a date with my sister
3. all the girls are out of my ""3 year limit"" (I try not to date anyone beyond three years of my age).
4. I'm shy/a coward when it comes to real live girls.

where was I? anyway, at the end of class when I changed back into my normal clothes, saul (saw-ool) and madison were playing around (kicking pads, running, jumping, ect.) I couldn't help but get involved, so I held the pads for saul for a bit.
Madison'a a lil' cutey, it seems like whenever I draw somebody's picture they are sorta my friend. so far I've drawn: adda, madison, scott (me), sounds like soo-gee-heart-o, austin, and I drew sort of a sir in the background of adda's pic.
the only people there hat are around my age are guys, I don't really know if anybody else at this school is 16.

well, I suppose I've taken up enough of your time, tomorrow's saturday, enjoy your weekend."

"event","so today had alot of ups and downs.

I woke up early enough to talk to kelsie for a bit, but she made a big list of stuff she wants, and being me I'm gonna get it all for her.

I left late for school, yet I was the first student to show up.
while I was there earlier than the other students, I couldn't concentrate to well, and I was tired.

I got to counseling on time, but all I did while I was there was talk about me :-P
before I left counseling I got a hug from my counselor, yet it didn't last nearly long enough to make me happy.

on the way home I caught a bus and didn't have to walk my bike up any hills, but I put my bike in the wrong area.
when I got off the bus I noticed the kickstand on my bike wasn't working so well anymore, but atleast I didn't have to walk up those hills.

I showed up at home to wake up my brother and make a snack, my brother went back to sleep really fast, and my sandwhich was flat by the time I ate it.

I brought a fellow student a backpack, but she wasn't there so I put it in the hands of the school counselor.

I'm done with the ged pre-tests, but I still have trouble writing essays.

at tae kwon do it was sparring day again, I got hit alot, and didn't do much hitting (must've been the other person's day).
when I was putting my helmet on to go home they annoyed me about my hair again, they're probably justplaying around, but it really hur my feelings.

on the bike ride home, I got home safely, but I got teary from my thoughts.

I had my dobak washed, so now it's drying.

I made lots of pasta and had 2 plates of it, now I feel kinda fat.

I talked to my bro's girlfriend, but I couldn't say to much interesting stuff.

ok, so here I am, pretty depressed, pinky still fractured.
I feel like life sucks, but it's alot better than it used to be.

p.s. I need more hugs, and more friends."

ok, now that my ranting is over let's see the good things that have happened....

1. I saw adda (such a cute lil' girl) for like 12 seconds.
2. I rode my bike
3. I got my laundry done (that reminds me, a pair of trousers tore so I patched it with a rubber band)
4. I have time to play diablo 2: LOD
5. I drew a valentine for the lmatkd students(... and they'll probably never see it.)
6. people think I look better with conacts than glasses.
7. yesterday I got an incentive check for $50 from school (woot!)
8. my computer is still working fine.
9. kelsie was supposed to talk to me today, but instead she's been sending e-mail durring the week.
10. my nopets are happy and healthy.
11. I have a check-up at lense crafters tomorrow 
12. I'm one episode away from having downloaded all the episodes of chobits

I'm pretty happy right now^_^


kelsie talked to me on saturday, it was just a quick chat, we played diablo
and she told me how all her characters are atleast 35 levels higher than me.
after me and kelsie played diablo she went off to the cinema (movies).

I'm downloading chobits at the moment, the last episode is pretty heart warming.

last words: in the old west bad guys died well hung."

"event","hello again.
today I ate oatmeal with dried berries, and oven cooked buttered toast for breakfast.
for lunch... pasta and tomato sauce. dinner, tuna cucumber sandwhich with tuna mayo mix on the size.
I accomplished cleaning the toilet yesterday ^_^ I guess that's good.
I cleaned my bike today, it's less dirty now.
I'm kinda missing hotter weather, but I know I've gotten cranky in the past when I got too hot.
when I was rinsing the dirt off my bike, I was getting frost bite in my fingers.

I procrastinated alot today. I played diablo II: LOD and gained 5 levels on my character (I named my asassin char. Melixshina, just to spite kelsie *devilish grin*)
kelsie just popped up and messaged me on saturday or friday, I don't remember.
kelsie's quit smoking, good for her. she's been busy with her life and school and stuff, so she can't talk for a while, whatever.
as long as we're friends things'll go fine.

I played deadlock 2 and it froze on me, oh well maybe next time.
school tomorrow, and my first schedualed appointment with the onsight counselor (I told a very secret secret to a teacher and she reccomended I see the counselor)
I've been playing galaxy 105 (english radio station) since last night.

I'm gonna have to stop playing online games and get out more, next weekend is gonna be better, no online gaming unless it happens to be saturday afternoon.

I guess there's not much more to say, I gotta go shopping tomorrow, I've offered to fly one of josh's friends here, I'm looking forward to Pizza Pi on the 6th or 7th, my food is running low, it's left to pasta, bread, water, a can of pineapple, spaghettie sauce, and little more. I miss cheese.
last month I saved up $50 so that totaly rocks! I hope my mouth gaurd comes in soon, I could use it for bike riding (not that I need it).

well, I'm thinking I'll brush my teeth and take a bath now.
good night everybody ^_^

I took a GED practice test for reading, social studies, and science. each score was over 500 points^_^. so the teacher signed me up to take a test in february.

I got to come home and eat a late lunch, then I went to tae kwon do.
at tae kwon do I ran, I stretched, I hit pads with my feet.... and I totally banged my knee on a wall OUCH!

the new guy: Sugee harto... I don't know if my spelling is accurate on that, anyway, he has amazingly powerful kicks, and they're fast too. his only flaw is that since he just started his form isn't perfected yet. for 2 or 3 days he's been doing great.

I drew a big muscly bald guy, and I gave away a pack of oreos. aren't I so generous -_-.

well, I'm doing laundry. see you later everybody."

"event","saturday was really fun^_^.
we did kicking exercises, pretty common for tae kwan do, but my partner had sore muscles so I felt left out... ok I didn't pay much attention either, but I tried to work hard.

when I showed up for class I was taking my shoes off, and when austin (a 4' little girl) went to get some water it went like this:
me: hi austin. ^_^
austin: hi... HEY! how do you know my name?
me: it's on the wall over there with your picture...
austin: ... *walks back to the mat*
me: south seattle right?
austin: what?
me: you live in south seattle right? Adda told me that one.
austin: you know too much.
me: oh dear, am I going to have to die now?

to be perfectly honest I noticed austin alot when she's attending classes, she's just so cute^_^.
I heard sir call her that, so I checked the pictures to verify it.
I notice austin and carry more than anybody else... well I notice adda and her brother too.. I think he's her brother, they show up for class together.
I owe Adda a slice of pizza^_^' at the in house turnament that happened 1/17/04 she gave me a slice of cheese pizza, I believe in returning favors and good manors.

on saturday I kept blocking with my elbows >_< I do it out of instinct, but part of the class is about beating your instincts.
the only good thing out of the blocking I did was... I hurt the other person?^_^'
I want to get full body armor(pads and stuff) I paid for a mouth gaurd, but I returned it cause it was youth size (I didn't notice till I got it home) so sir ordered me another one, I'll ask if it showed up this wednesday.

so I kept falling asleep this morning, funny huh? by the time I woke up I felt so happy, I don't know why. I appreciated the shower I tooke so much, I appreciated the soap, the shower head baba gave us.
after I got out of the shower I dried off, put on some clothes, and started up the computer and PSO 1&2 for game cube. I looked up baba ""black sheep"" online and made a new character on PSO I named this one ""Scott M.J.#b <--(resembles my actual signature) I sent an e-mail with a link and some lyrics to baba and kelsie.
I'm finally over kelsie! I'm so happy. I can now move on with my life.
it seems to be working pretty correctly with my internal clock. on average it takes me about a year to get over somebody I really like. kelsie officially broke up with me a little after v-day last year (2003) she SORT'A cheated on me (our relationship was completely online) with this guy luke or whatever. turns out she didn't really really like him, she was just hungry for some physical attention.
I figure kelsie unintentionaly used me. from the moment I met her she liked me. after she found out I wouldn't cyber with her thinks progressively slowed down (pluss I acted like a jerk and tried to control her life), when we finaly really met things sped up again, she was happy to see me. then after having sex it stabalized at a high point, then something happened and it blew to pieces.
well she got sex, then she was done with me. currently she's engaged to an ex-bf she doesn't really want to marry, I give her my blessing cause he'd make a better father than I could... ok, done with her, right!

so it's 2 hours after lunch, I think I'll make a sandwich now, maybe take a ride to northgate if it's not too got. bye everybody, have a nice day."

"event","<lj-cut text=""My Day"">I woke up today after 3 or so hours of sleep (what's wrong with me!) but it's no big deal. I had time to take a shower, get dressed, eat something, brush my teeth, and then get out the door.

*on the bus* omg, so many hot girls! I love the bus^_^

so I got to children's was directed to the sign in area, then directed to a ct scan place (radiology?). I drank this weird stuff that makes parts of my body more visible to the scan or whatever, and I kept falling asleep in the waiting room!
by the time I had finished my second cup of the stuff, I had een there a while. not that I'm really complaining, there was a really nice mom and her daughter there. I drew a picture of the daughter. when I asked her name, it was something like... aurariella? I asked her how to spell it, and she wipped the whole thing out in under 3 seconds O_O I was like ""omg, I'm never gonna spell this."". I had a weird look on my face, so the mom said ""did you expect something simpler? like, Susan?""
I could'nt do more than smile... and go to the restroom soon after (that water they gave me just shoots through a body). I talked to them a little bit here and there.
the mom ended up turning the tv in the room to court tv, and then animal planet.
they're ver nice people, the daughter looked about... 12 3/4-13 years old.
she had a pink shirt and grey sweats on. she was very cute.

after waiting in the waiting room for like... 4 hours (I showed up early) somebody came out and told us the machine stopped working properly, so I got reschedualed for the 4th of february. it was then that I remembered, hannah's and my mom's birthday are coming up. I also remembered hannah doesn't want me to give her presents any (she didn't say it exactly liike that though).

*on the bus coming home* p-p-pretty girls everywhere^_^. thank you god!

I've seen so many people that remind me of kelsie and kiri, speaking of the de la hayes, somebody at children's was named Kiana.
so I'm going to attempt going Vegan again, I'll go at it slowly, like starting to replace things when I cook, and trying out alternatives.

I have tae kwon do soon, it's almost 5 pm.

I think me and Adda have sorta become aquaintances (sorta a friend but we don't do  anything together when we're not at class).

I had vegitarien pizza for lunch, mmmm.
I love pizza^_^

well of I go to work now, bye bye everyone.

P.S. at my eye docter appointment she decided I needed a stronger perscription, she also said she couldn't size me for contacts so I'd have to ask somebody at where I get my glass (gonna try lense crafters, down at northgate mall.)</lj-cut>"

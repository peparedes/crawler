on a more serious note, my second session class starts soon, which means i have to start waking up at 9am.  this is going to be strange and hard, considering i cant remember the last time i went to sleep before sunrise.

A PITCHER OF ALCOHOL!!!! but it gets better because they flavor it so you cant even taste any!  so last night me dan heather justin ryan and my english teacher from last semister (susan martin for any of you i told about her).  we met heather and some other g man people there. we left to go to chumleys for a few hours because its quiet and inexpensive.  then it was back to the saloon to meet everyone else who was there. what a night, drank WAY too much yet again. being 21 is still cool by the way.

P.S. the monkey boys are 5$ during happy hour, and if you can drink more than 3 and walk out of the saloon, i respect you.  they come in a variety of flavors, the best is bong water."

"event","i fucking love the summer in state college, (for those of you who didnt hear im not coming back).  Ive been out partying with all the cool people who stayed for the last couple days till sunrise.  the friday ""chase the semister away"" / ""goodbye you fucking dorm kids"" / ""bye friends who arent staying"" kegger, and its just been going since there.  it was a sad weekend, had to say goodbye to some friends, but we had a wonderful time.

work is SO fucking boring however, there is nobody in the town so i spend alot of my time being bored.  Im going to be taking a summer class or 2 tho, so that will kill some time.  ive decided in recent days that im not cut out for the journalism major anymore.  the current degrading state of today's media is sickening, and i cant see myself doing work in that feild anymore.  id like to make money AND be able to sleep at night.  now im going to change my major to philosophy.  i know, stop snickering i know its funny,  but ive decided id like to teach college level philosophy for a living.  there is a lack of phil professors at the moment anyway, so the feild has openings.  job opprotunites are a plus, and since you are sort of in demand its even better.  but the interaction with the students in a college level phil class is going to make it worth it.  i get to spend the rest of my life arguing my ideals and thoughts wo a group of students, and getting to hear each of their unique responses, and learn about their viewpoints.  the prospect of waking up to that every day is amazing.  its guarenteed constant mental stimulation every single work day.  every day would be like having a coffee house style conversation with complete strangers all day long, it would never get old or never be the same.

for the first time since i was a freshman im excited about school.  i actually am feeling a passion for what im about to be doing.  im taking some summer classes just so i can get started even sooner. i feel like ive been given a new life, and i cant wait to start it."

"event","Wow, last night was the most fun i have had in a long time.  After taking my english final, i worked at the G-man for like 3 hours. i was SUPPOSED to be quitting, but since i officially live here now, i kind of have to keep working.

went over to the 101 after i was off, and all of us (and there were alot of us) headed over to catharsis, the local ""goth"" club for some dancing.  There were only about 40 people there, which i guess is kind of standard, but i ran into some friends, danced to some goth music for the first time in FOREVER and smoked a hookah.  Catharsis is in the basement of the Tall Shiva Hookah Lounge, where you can buy a packed hookah (full of tobbacco of course) and chill and smoke with you friends.  It was alot of fun.  

Around 1am we decided to crash the party of some girl that the 101 hates, so off we went. this had to be the LAMEST party ive ever been to, it was an apartment party, but it was like REALLY lame, all there was to drink was queer beer, like smirnof, mikes hard lemonade, and fucking sky blue.  to combat against the lack of alcohol i spilled about 5 cups of fruit punch on the carpet. that should teach the bitch.  this girl apparently stole from the 101 back in the day, and had to be punished. we took some martini glasses, a snow globe, the dimmer switch to her lights and some magnets.  trust me, we got all that was worth stealing.  the only funny (and really sad) part of the party, was the bouncer.  yeah there was a fucking bouncer in an apartment party.  dan and katie started beating the shit out of each other, and the fucking BOUNCER broke it up. it was wrong.

when that got boring we headed back to the 101, and chilled for a while.  alot of people came over and formed sort of an imprompteau after hours party.  i left around 630.  on the way home i passed the water fountain outside of the Biolife building, and somebody put detergent in it, filling it with bubbles.  i called dan and matt and they came and played in the bubbles with me at 7 in the morning, in the middle of a buisy intersection of state college.  what a day.

more to come later, apparently there is a jell-o wrestling party tonite, gotta get ready"

I went to this party, a guy i work with was playing there with his band Dr. Innoculus or something. It was a dirty hippie party. i got there and there were like 100 dirty hippies bobbing and swaying to the ""crunchy jam beats"".  There was happy music and bright colors and people having a good time dancing the night away.  I lasted roughly 5 minutes before i said ""fuck it"" and walked home.  
I fucking hate hippies, with their dirty dredlocks, and their fucking patchouli oil. fuck them. fuck them all with a pipe bomb, then hit the detanator. I want to rape all of their mothers with a meat cleaver."

"event","so i guess ive been having a good time over sprimng break so far, im not really doing anythign tho. oh and also, just found out today that if i dont give my parents 1000 dollars by the start of next semister, im not going back to school, so that was pretty rockin news to find out. they really want me to get an intership at a newspaper over the summer or something, and it seems all they want me to do is work full time, like 70 hours a week.  i kind of wanted to have fun this summer, VNV Nation, Tiger Army, Nine Inch Nails, Warped, The Cruxshadwos and a bunch of other bands i like will be playing, so i didnt want to miss that.

Now that i think about it tho, i am going to be 21, maybe it is time that a settle down and take on a little responsibility like an internship or something. it would probably be really fun, but i just dont want to be working all summer, i did that once with the holiday inn and it really sucked.  im so not sure what i want to do. part of me wants to be a grown-up but part of me wants to stay a kid and have fun.

this doesnt seem like a hard choice, but i just dont want to let go. i have always hated the idea of a 9-5 job with a 401K, but maybe its time."

The absinthe should be arriving today or tomorrow, and if it takes longer than that im going to be really upset. i cant wait to get that terrible green liquid into my system. If Hemmingway and Wilde drank it i should too. we were joking that after the first drink my writing carear was going to take off, and that would be funny.... if i ever wrote. the only thing i want to do with my degree is write obituaries, so maybe i should start practicing that lol.

things have been very weird lately, i have alot of really strange decisions to make. decisions that i shouldnt have to make. i love how confusing life can get at times, but no matter how confusing it gets i can still rely on a few things. 

im going to go enjoy some hot tea and play world of warcraft. im calling in sick today.

Hi Jeff,

Thanks for your comments.  I suppose the devil can take any innocuous term and turn it around for his evil ends.  And to be frank, when the title was created, it was done to indicate that these were promoting groups that were little known, and thus you'd have to see them at out of the way places to check them out.  There was no knowledge of such a street term.

We cannot let groups with an anti-moral agenda keep taking these innocuous terms and changing them around for their own nefarious ends.  They can keep doing this, until there is no more vocabulary we can use to speak!  We have to fight back.  Therefore, if you were to hear the term ""back door"" again, I invite you to not think of the common street term, but of great Christian musicians that are not yet well-known. 

Thanks again for your letter.

Nick

got back last night and my GOD do i hate my family

im basically stuck in my room because if i go downstairs im just going to get more crap off them. my mum came into my room this morning saying shed been talking to my cousin and accusing me of a bunch of stuff. they think theyre so sneaky the way they are piecing loads of random stuff together and talking about me behind my back. i can just imagine them staging an intervention any day now. HOW o.c.

i really need to go to london to get some clothes before bhasvic because im quite bored of the clothes they have in the shops here as you just KNOW everyones going to have them.

im going to be so BUSYYY and i dont know whether its a good or a bad thing. theres a party and then a wedding this weekend and i sure hope its fun! im really not looking forward to next week because its going to be so tiring and blahblahblah but hopefully worth it in the end.

"event","cant stop listening to oh on repeat
it has a nice soothing quality

woke up today at 5 which was resonable seeing as i went to bed at dawn. stayed up watching that 1996 romeo + juliet and the day after tomorrow.
romeo and juliet was really really shit but we watched it in english lessons and i was feeling in a nostalgic mood. it made me remember a bunch of stuff i forgot, like how i wrote sasquatch over katie groves notes when she wasnt looking and how benvolio was harriets favourite character because he said ROMAYO and had a lovely shirt. good times.
the day after tomorrow is the kind of film i can watch over and over but never really get bored of it because im not actually paying attention to whats happening. also it reminded me of when i saw it in the cinema.
TAKE
IT
OFF
oh i well miss my schooldays.

collins says shes spiraling and that her life sucks and that it isnt gold. mainly because she cant listen to gold by spandau ballet. i was feeling like that but im kind of excited about the future, even though i really need to step up my game. i know exactly what i want now, and im going to get it. im sick of not doing what i want because everyone else thinks its a bad idea. that sounds bitchy but i mean it in the nicest possible way.

the people vs larry flint is on tonight!!"

last night was fun. people were nice and i got pissed on pineapple malibu so it was all good. it was such a nifty secret birthday party. my house didnt even get trashed, and some people even cleaned up abit and i thought that was actually proper nice of them.

today i was so tired it was hard to move so i just raided my video collection in the loft and watched movies ive never seen before. i saw dead poets society, which was quite bad and made me want to see jumanji, then gattaca which was good and then i found the sunshine boys?!(the 1975 one) which i didnt know we had and so i watched it and it was great.

then i kept on trying to make myself dinner but i was missing a vital ingredient for each thing i thought of. everything in my fridge was highly disgusting and of questionable freshness.

my hair smells like blueberry vodka mix which collins threw on me! skank. i want to have a shower and then i need to set about returning things people left at my party. i managed to locate everything everyone lost/left behind. call me if you want your stuff back or i might just pawn it all for a rolex.

god im still really happy because i found so much gold in my loft. i found a bunch of 'best of' cds, 15 euros and a computer. WHY WOULD SOMEONE PUT THAT SHIT IN A LOFT!"

im having a birthday party on friday 8th july
not a big house party but quite a fair amount of people i guess and its going to have a theme because me and collins want to dress up!
if you want to come then you can, but no one i dont actually know/havent heard of is coming in so dont bring a bunch of random people or tell people to bring people because i dont want my house to get trashed!!

im so loving ladytron right now
also that song two of hearts by stacy q from party monster
im so playing that at my party eheh!!"

today i had english which went ok i hope and then i watched anchorman which was quite funny especially the jazz flute bit and then i went to see sin city which was AMAZING.

its only 30 days till disney and im well excited.

tomorrow my mums friend and his son are staying at our house. his son is in my year and a SWOT apparently and his sister was anorexic and their parents are weird and slightly crazy and i dont really want to spend time with them. they are going to see an acoustic guitar concert. fucking cool.

arhgh i have to get some sleep so i can revise maths and chemistry tomorrow when i would really just do other stuff. apparently the weather is going to be shit this next week so i guess sun wont be a distraction or whatever.

yesterday i had the weirdest dream that was in night vision mode and included someone reading mein campf and something about a party and it was weirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrddd.

i hope i dream sin city style tonight cause that would be ace."

after latin which was quite good cause the poem i wanted was on it, i went to town with annika and collins and we went to this buffet place and collins stole ALL of these potato things shes obsessed with and we kept on seeing people looking for them and she wouldnt stop laughing. also i bought mystic dragon flavour capri sun!

saturday:
me + da oc+ olivia wd went to sams party. wd spent the whole time talking and then getting off in this darkened room with 'dan' who was really ugly. err WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU WD U USED TO HAVE MORALS! then me and collins just went round talking to random people whos names i dont really remember. i think we annoyed oscar abit cause he just put on his 'GENUINE DKNY SUNGLASSES' and gave us evils. he looked WELL like the terminator. then we spoke to someone called tom and a guy in a brown cap who liked avril lavigne?.. jack clock was nice cause he wrote me a poetic note and gave me some wine! i kept on trying to act 'stealth' but i tripped on the stairs whilst talking to sam and emile. BUT I DIDNT FALL OVER SO ITS OK!

sunday:
i dont remember sunday. i think i read of mice and men cause we have our english tomorrow!

monday:
went to the concorde 2 battle of the bands with sarah cause collins had art to do. first were hots = how good. they bl8 should have won! loads of people kept on shouting WHOAREYOU WHOAREYOU GET OFF THE STAGE WOOO HOTS at the 2nd band! i felt abit sorry for them though but it was ok cause they were shit.
then there was a no doubt wannabe band and an interpool wannabe band and a pvc feather bower glam rock wannabe band. i saw some people i knew and that was nice erm and then we left and eugguhg i smelt so badly of smoke.

TODAY:
i bought some black drainpipes from h+m which was good except i needed to sew them abit.
i want to make a mixed tape. YEAHTHATSRIGHTATAPE. but i lost the plug to my hifi.
does anyone have any song ideas/??"

"event","yeah so i have the flu
and i really should have checked my phone in the last few days cause i missed out on some stuff
including a picnic today
but its raining
so no harm done

the best thing about being ill is presents
my mum has gone to get me HEAT and ice cream cause my temperature is 38.9 and apparently you dont need a doctor until its over 39
also da oc has got me a present and i dont know what it is
mtv has taken over her life

maybe columbo is better than kojak
a lollypop AND a detective
pick one or the other"

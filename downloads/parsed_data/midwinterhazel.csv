"event","Hello!  I am having a great day and actually a great time.  Ever since i got here to VCU things have been different but i am starting to make sence of it all.  Because of this i have decided im going to put the bulk of colonial heights behind me.  I might not even come home this weekend.  I found out that if u dont hit the ground running that does not mean that u cant EVER run... just u need to wait a while.  True i have problems but it all makes me want to stay for a while... down here.  So because of this i have deleted everyone on my LJ friends list.  The only reason that i would add someone to it is if they are at this college or i have some kind of strong tie to them that would make me want to see how there day was every day.  I am still going to get on AIM frequently so if someone wants to tell me something they can tell it to me.  However, i encourage everyone to live their lives without me.  I dont want anyone to ruin this great day of mine and i dont want to ruin anyone elses great day.  So live. :) God bless."

"event","This is my favorate poem... its short and beautiful... it rhymed when it was written originally in japanese...

Underneith the blue sky,
The wind blows towards the future,
As if to draw the rays of the sun into an embrace.
I just let it push me around...
Leaving only my footprints behind,
If i have the air to stroke my cheek and soft grass to fall down on,
I don't need anything else.
Sleeping with a contented smile,
I stare into tomorrow,
That streches on endlessly."

"event","Well today i arrived at VCU.  I was going to meet up with my friends at a place i didnt see on the map so i decided to just get on a bus and wing it.  Well i got lost.  I figured i was going to get lost anyway so i might as well get it all out of my system now while i can still use the excuse that its my first day here.  Tomorrow will be much better as far as knowing where things are.  My roommate is kool and we are going to make our dorm room look like a rave club :)  There isnt much more to say that is especially interesting to the non college person.  Oh!  My mom said that my books should cost like $400 a semester and i got all my books except for one with only $180.  It is coming out of graduation money and my mom said i can spend the money i saved on whatever i want!  After further costs (scantrons, final book, etc.) i should be about $150 richer than i thought i would be.  I miss u Tiffany already :(  Im going to see u on friday and sunday evening if u make it back on time.  I should get home on friday before u wake up ;)  Well im going to bed.  Its close to midnight and i REALLY need to get on a better sleep schedual."

"event","Kid: ""Here Teacher!  I have an apple for u!"" *big innocent smile*

Teacher: *thinks: Holy shit!  This boy is offering me a apple.  No one has ever offered me an apple  in class before; what do i do?!  I cant take it.  But if i dont take it then i will not have that oh so infatuating taste in my mouth.  Oh how i need that smooth skin on my face, hands, and lips.  I want to bite into the juicy flesh that is milky white!  And the texture of it! oh the texture is such a vibrant blend of being rough and being sweet all at the same time.  My thoughts are a blur!  I cannot let myself be taken over by this lust in the classroom, right in front of the children!  But if i wait it might wither and die; like a red rose passion for it burns in my heart but its time is short like that same rose.  Oh!  I need to feel that smooth, hard thing and work it with my mouth until the white inside pours out all over my face and into my mouth.  Then i will let the juices pour down out of my willing mouth and let it drain down my hot neck and breasts.  I would do it anywhere; in bed, on a kitchen counter, even in the woods! but not here in the classroom!  Actually, it would be kind of fun to do it in the classroom.  But not in front of the children!  Oh the temptation is hard, but i can fight my body's desires!  I will resist!!* *the teacher snatches the apple from the kid* ""Gimme that!""

Are you're kids getting too much of the Americans for the Arts?
Where's the creativity?
I don't see any.
These commercials need to be cut;
Making is easier for my kids and yours.
Arts education can't be THAT important so it goes.
Fight it!
Cause the more arts kids get,
The more it blows.
Talking, complainin', to weird music,
Arts education is no thing!
How's that mom?
Remember what I told ya Chuck:
Less money to commercials,
And more money to your cause."

"event","I stayed up all night reading and playing on neopets.  Im still trying to get on a better sleep schedual for college.  I need to be awake from basically 8 in the morning to 5 at night; i can sleep whenever i feel like besides that time.

I decided i need to make some money so im going to start selling things i dont need anymore on ebay.  Im going to start selling all my ork models then im going to sell my magic cards then my UO account and possibly my guitar stuff.  I could make a large amount of money if i tried hard.  There are a lot of things i want more than the things i listed and truthfully i wouldnt hardly know most of it was gone, except i would have more room in my house.

I saw an awesome commercial today!  This really really preppy cheerleader chick goes into her dorm for the first time and this TOTALLY gothic girl is in the room.  The entire side of her room is black, all her clothes are black, and she is burning flames and candals all around.  The new girl fills the closet with a bunch of pink stuff and acts all cutesy.  Then they both open their laptop at the same time and it is the same laptop!  Then they smile at each other.  It was kool.

I am really going to miss Tiffany when she is gone. :( I hope she calls me sometimes when shes away.  I hopefully will get some studying and work done while she is away and hopefully come up with a surprise for her when she gets home.  Something to look foreward to at least.  It will be better than the last surprise.  The last one was just tradition.

The teen center is stagnating.  I really dont know if it is going to come to furition or not.  We have hit so many walls and we are starting to find out that people really dont support it as much as we thought.  It really sux.  There is one glimmer of hope: the election.  My dad and i weild the power to make a candidate look like an enimy of the youth or a total friend to the community as a whole.  Power is so great. :-D

I found out that one of my favorate bands: Dave Matthews Band, is performing free concerts to get George W. Bush unelected.  That really sux because i would expect better foresight than that from such a great poet and musician.  The whole anti-war thing is getting out of hand.  Being anti-war is being anti-American.  Being anti American is being anti-yourself.  So if u dont like what we do then get the hell out. Sorry.

I need my Homer book back from kristena.  Just whenever u get around to it id like it back.  I might need it for college. :)

I made my first purchase on ebay today!  I bought a bonzai.  A Japanese Juniper that is three years old to be specific.  You can see what one looks like buy clicking here --> http://www.geocities.com/queenknuckles/bonsai/page24.htm  They are so awesome and it really reflects the kind of person i am (or want to become).  Plus, the longer one has a bonzai the more rewarding it seems to be.  I am going to go to the bonzai museum in Washington DC on saturday most likely.  It will get my mind off of missing my Tiffany a little."

"event","Today i signed up for an e-bay account.  After it was activated i realized that i have begun a new chapter in my economic life.  One year ago, there were the following limits on my economic life:
1. if i had enough cash for it?
2. do i feel like going out to get it?
3. does my mom approve of it?
4. does it freaking exist?
5. is there a place in driving distance that sells it?
6. can only adults buy it?
7. is there a better price?

Now, with the power of e-bay and my 18ness these are my answers:
1. i dont use cash... i use a debit card... how much money is in it? hell if i know!
2. i can get it leaving the house or without hardly moving actually
3. my mom doesnt see what i buy, i could order an AK47 and all she sees is a box
4. if it exists, it is for sale on ebay, even souls (not joking)
5. the only driving i need to do to get it is hard drive (god that was lame)
6. u can only get an e-bay account if u are 18 so everything is available
7. at e-bay u get the best price because u name the price

Now enters a new plethora of questions:
1. how long will it take to ship?
2. how long before the auction ends?
3. how much is the item worth to me?
4. should i sell something on e-bay?

Those are much better and easier to answer questions, wouldnt u say?

My e-bay wishlist:
Trigun DVD boxset
Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVD boxset
Aqua Teen Hunger Force t-shirt
nice watch
fountain pen
camcorder
feng shui lo` pan compass
bansai
two 15 pound weights
some chinese and japanese decorations for my college dorm
the koolest lamp on earth for my dorm
several books
goth wear
a really kool chain made of platinum

Wow not only is my list long, it is very expensive.  I have to restrict my spending because im going to need a lot of books very soon and they arent cheap.  I will probably have to buy 5 books at $80 each with some extra money to throw around.  So i have strictly limited funds as of now, i just dont know what im strictly limited to because my debit card doesnt have a counter on it so in order to find out how much i have i have to go all the way to the bank and get a status slip.  And that requires moving."

I have one neopet and i only plan on having one.  His name is Midwin (short for Midwinter) and hes this cute baby dragon thing with a big adorable eye.  He is only like two days old but his intelligence is ""bright"" which is pretty damn high for a youngster.  Im going to keep making money and buying books for my little guy.  He is going to be a kool color like silver or sparkly or white or maybe even snow because im going with a snow theme.  Hints the name Midwin.

I am currently working on a CD project. I am going to listen to EVERY LAST ONE of the songs i have in my possession and throw away CDs i dont like anymore.  I will also try to take the good songs from my CDs that only condtain a few good songs on them and put them all onto a few CDS; its an attempt to reduce the amount of CDs i have. I am also going to, as i hear all of those songs, keep track of the best ones and such and create a CD with all of them on it :)"

"event","I have a crossbow mounted under the hood of my car.  Whenever i wish to use it i can press a button on my steering wheel and the crossbow extends out of the front grill of the car and aims to fire.  I have digital crosshairs and the trigger for it build into the front of my steering wheel like a touch screen TV.  Now many of u all may be wondering how i accurately shoot crossbow bolts from my car while driving, and that is a very good question.  The answer: seeking crossbow bolts.  I have programmed the crossbow bolts to seek out certain targets and never miss.  Now the military is still using primative ""heat seeking"" technology; i have since upgraded my crossbow bolts to seek whatever i want.  This is a list of all the different types of seeker crossbow bolts i use:

1. front axle of skateboard seeking (whenever i see an annoying skateboarder i put them out of misery by firing the bolt and it lodges itself into the front axle of their board and causes it to stop spinning; this causes the person riding the skateboard to fall flat on their face as the skateboard stops and they do not)

2. sideways upside down visor seeking (if a guy wears his visor turned to the side while it is upside down then they have rendered the hat completely useless; such idiocy is a trait of only jocks and preps and so i designed this bolt to ruin such hats but jabbing through it, the persons head just gets in the way)

3. fitch seeking (i am not a big fan of preps but i have grown to tolerate many of the clothing brands they like including american eagle and areopostel... i would even go as far as abercrombie... but when a shirt or something says both abercrombie and fitch on it than it drips with prepishness and must die)

4. soccor ball bumper sticker seeking (soccor moms are EVERYWHERE, they are completely obsessed with their children and take the liberty to brag on everything their kid has done thinking they are the best kid in the world... they are also extremely loud and usually abnoxious and fat and always try to sell u things like cheap candy bars and such... so i have designed this crossbow bolt to seek out those stickers [part of the soccor mom uniform] and place a nasty scratch on their car)

5. greenpeace related item seeking (greenpeace is an organization that is ULTRA pro environment... they ride large ships called ""rainbow warriors"" out in front of oil tankers to stop them from tanking oil on the ocean... then set fire and destroy SUVs because they burn a lot of gas... they put large steel rods in trees so when people try to cut them down it breaks their saw and the metal shards kill them instead of the tree... these terrorists need to be stopped!)

6. LSD fume seeking (i like people on LSD trips... i dont want to kill them... which is why i only made the bolt seek the fumes... this has the effect of a bolt wizzing by your face when u are trippin... i just want to see what they think it is... cause its really no telling what they saw...)"

"event","I am currently looking to get some jewelry for college.  I will be sponsoring a gothic look with the all dark clothing, white contacts, and steady dispossition.  To keep with the black and white theme in my jewelry i will need to use the color black and either silver, platinum, or white gold.  I am looking for a watch, a necklace, a wallet chain, all, none, or some of the above.  I have a lot of money to spend but need to allocate a good amount of it to college where they say i will be needing lots of money.  Truthfully, im on a prepaid meal plan and use of the college gyms are free, so the only things i will be spending money on is books and if my friends and i decide to go to a movie ($2).  I have discovered the watch i would like to buy.  It is a Rolex Professional Oyster Explorer with a black dial (face) and silver body.  I could get one on ebay for about $800 which is too much.  The necklace i want is a 925 silver necklace with a basic chain stlye.  It is $80, not bad.  The chain i want is also 925 silver that is absolutely beautiful.  Check it out on ebay:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=45377&item=4909468514&rd=1#ebayphotohosting

it ends in 18 hours though.  It is $75; again, not bad.  I will decide what i am going to do at a later date.  Until then ta.  Wow i enjoyed saying that probably more than any guy should, but thats ok."

"event","The following are book titles that are not published that would make a lot of money if they were published but should not be published because of obvious moral reasons:

""How to Commit Suicide for Dummies"" (Ever heard of the Darwin Awards?  Imagine if u could write a book that would be purchased by all those who won that award.  This book would be a bestseller and make its writer rich!)

""You DO Have a Mental Disorder, Which One Is It?"" (Truthfully, everyone has a mental disorder.  The real question is if it effects the self or society in an intollerably negative way.  People would buy the book just because the first part of the book would make them paranoid.)

""My First Porno Magazine"" (This would be a children's book.  After a child's sexual enlightenment they go through a stage where they very strongly desire a naked body of the opposite sex.  This book would probably be sold to every little kid in the states provided it was legal and not in view of their parents.)

""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Genocide"" (Switch on the news right now.  They are probably calling someone a racist, sexist, or pointing the blame at them for some kind of predjudice.  Imagine if u sold a book to each one of those people, u would be rolling in the Benjermans!)

""How to Punish Your Children Without It Being Concidered Child Abuse"" (I would probably buy this book just to put it on my bookshelf where my kid would see it every day.  Everytime he or she would talk back or refuse to clean his or her room then i would take out the book and just start reading as say things like ""OK, so this *makes motion in the air like swinging a bat* then that *makes motion like stabing knife* but just make sure u hit them only in the crotch area because 80% of children are too embarassed to show their crotch area to a judge.  Wow! I love this book!"")

""Guide to Getting Into Girl's Pants"" (This would be halarious to publish just because men would buy it thinking it was a guide to getting laid.  They would be disappointed to find that it is actually a diet book for women so they can fit into smaller pants.)

""In My House, a Novel"" (This book would have a pic of a random house on it.  The beauty in this is that it is completly neutral.  Mystery lovers will think it is a murder mystery, housewives will think it is a sex story, teenage boys will think it is a horror novel, old people would think it was a heartfelt and traditional story about a family.  Literally everyone would buy it.)

""Men's Dictionary to the Women's Language"" (This is a great idea.  Not only would every man in the world want to buy it, they would HAVE to buy it.  Their wives would make them buy it.  The reason it would be morally wrong to publish it is women THRIVE on confusing men and if they find that they can no longer confuse them with their language, they will create a new one.  This new language will be even harder to figure out and they will continue to confuse men but on an even worse level.)"

"event","We approach Bob and Dave while they are watching the six o'clock news.  They are about to debate the answer of a very good question.

News: Tiger Woods wins the award for having the best sportsmanlike conduct in the sport of golf.

Bob: There's an award for sportsmanlike conduct?

Dave: Wow, i didn't even know golf was a sport.

Bob: ... how do u tell if somehting is a sport anyway?

DUN DUN DUN! (dramatic reverb)

Dave: I just say that if it is in the Olympics then it's a sport.  The Olympics are manyly men playing manly sports.

News: Justin Timberlake wins the Olympic gold medal for miniture golf.

Bob: I just go by the definition that there are only three sports; the old sports of baseball, basketball, and football.  Everything else is a game or activity.

Dave: Well what about the official sport of the Aztecs, soccor; is that a sport?

Bob: Soccor!  Soccor is nothing more than a live action game of fosball.

Dave: Well is fosball a sport?

News: Archeologists are uncovering what appears to be an anchient Aztec fosball table.

Bob: You can't sell beer at a fosball game.

Dave. Is beer drinking a sport?

Bob: Ok now u are just being annoying.

News: And there are urns under the fosball table where experts say wine was stored."

"event","Some of u may notice that i type in a slightly unusual way.  I always capitalize the first letter of every sentence, i always use correct punctuation, and i try hard to make all of my writing grammatically correct.  However, i do not capitalize the ""i"" unless it is at the beginning of a sentence, i say ""u"" instead of spelling out the word ""you,"" and i do not use spell check.  This is because i find it very relaxing to not have to worry about the capital ""i"" and minor rules of spelling.  I do find it relaxing to throw out all rules of grammar but i am also disturbed by a feeling of unintelligence which outweighs the relaxing feeling.  So i have discovered that this way of typing keeps me at the optimal level of relaxation and intelligence for a journal such as this.  I think it is very healthy for others to adopt a style of writing that conforms to their optimal levels.  It is true that some people may only be relaxed if everything is absolutely grammatically correct.  Others may find that they are quite pleased with work that is hardly grammatically correct at all.  I have found the style that suits me and i would encourage everyone to find the style that suits them."

"event","As of now, there is no answer to the meaning of life.  Spiritual people would say that it is to glorify God.  These people may be right but it lacks solid proof that there is a God to exalt.  Some would say that we, as the human race, need to look beyond our own civilizations and search for other life in the universe.  This again lacks hard evidence that other life exists and so it is useless to spend a lifetime looking for somehting that might not be there.  Other scientists would say that other lifeforms are not found by looking at larger things space but at smaller things like atoms.  Once more, no evidence of civilizations on quarks.  There are many people on earth that believe that the only reason we live and the only thing worth spending time on is pleasure to the self.  This is limited to your mind and body only, making it a waste of a life once the person is dead.  Then there are some people that say that we should spend our lives giving back to society.  But the society we live in is ever-changing, and never pleased.  The people that live in this world will not be living on it forever, so what one man spends his life on to give back to the community is a waste of time after a few decades when everyone who felt its effects are dead.  The conclusion is that there is no meaning to life that we know of.  The only thing we can do now is to have children in hopes that they will figure it out some day."

"event","Today was my day all right.  It was what i was created for, being the pixelated person i am trapped in the same spot spinning incessantly in the same direction.  I started wondering why i was not getting dizzy from all of this spinning; month after month i have been standing here spinning.  Many a time i have wondered why i do not hunger, or feel tired, but today i was pondering the subject of dizzyness.  Around and around i spun and i spun but my eyes stayed open and i stay up straight.  I looked on my belt and saw one pokeball on my belt.  I have never used it.  I do not even know how to use it.  Frankly, i do not know how i know that it is a pokeball.  It is very possible that it is programed into me, but how do i know that.  Then, the most interesting thing that has ever happened to me happened.  I saw someone!  For such a long time i was limited to six tiles on either side of me and i had not seen another person ever.  It looked exactly like me, but it moved and it walked right in front of my face.  I was so excited the only thing i could say was ""!"" and then i walked over to it.  I then said ""You have a POKEDEX! I want one too!"" I did not even know what i was saying.  Then i had to battle it.  The screen changed and i saw that it was a boy, and i saw myself!  My name is Pokefan ALEX and i have a son!  I had never seen him before; he appeared out of nowhere in a pikachu costume.  I sent out my pokemon, DELIBIRD, from my pokeball and realized that my opponent had six pokemon that were 5 levels above mine.  He made my DELIBIRD that i had never seen before faint in one hit then he took my money!  It was the most thrilling think a man has undergone.  I told him that he was pretty tough and i asked him if he wanted my phone number.  Without saying anything he ran off as quickly as he came.  Now i have stopped spinning, and i have a new outlook on life.  I have seen it all.  I do not even move i am still paralized with awe of what has happened.  I doubt i will ever see him again, but if i do, i will ask him if he wants my phone number, nothing more."

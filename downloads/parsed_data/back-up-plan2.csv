"event","Dude, I almost completely forgot I had a LJ...interesting. So this means I can be all emo and depressed eh? Well, Hmm...I feel like everyone hates me, but I guess it's because I try hard for them not to like me. Yeah, me having problems is an understatement. I really don't give a flying fuck about anything besides getting good grades in school, and having a good time, no matter the consequences. I'm moving soon, and that means buh-bye to everyone practically. Start another new life, make friends all over. That's easy, the only thing is if they're the good friends or the bad friends. But who needs friends? I have plenty, at least I think. They're just scattered everywhere.. everywhere that I'm not. I just want to get a car, a job and begin my countdown 'till I'm out of the house. I'm 16, how fucken sad is that. I'll be graduating at age 17! Oh, and I'm contemplating what I should really do as my career. Honestly, art is my natural talent. I don't want to do anything with animals. So why waste my time? I think I want to be some kind of graphic designer. I want to travel, I don't want to be tied down. (well, untill I'm married and have children yadda yadda)Why do people always bug me when I don't feel like talking? I'll talk if I feel like it, damn. All I feel like doing is listen to my ipod and read. Unless I'm out of school, then I feel like doing something (cough). Kinda like this weekend, mom and james will be out of town. hell yeah. We got some left, too. Oh, Nick thinks I like Joe. Whatever! I told him Chealsea does, god damn. He's a freshman, how low does he take me? Anyways, I think Chealsea is going to come to church with me. She'll see Joe there ^.^ 
I've had a headache all day. I need a hair cut, it's bothering me. I'm tired of it always being up, and it bugs me when it's down. Sarah has my hoodie at her house... I just remembered that. I think I bombed my English 3 test, and I ran through my American History Test. Like 10 minutes flat, if that much. I got 10 dollars, I fell so rich."

"event","my mom just slammed a bottle of advil on the table and yelled at me. she told me she doesn't like the way i talk to her, b/c im such a smartass. and then she said how does that feel? and i told her that im used to it. she askes if it was b/c of her, i said no. then i said. dad yelled at me all of the time, im used to it. and it's the truth. he yells at everything and everyone. the tv the dog, my brothers, me, the cable guy, the waiter, the computer. he just yells all of the time. and when mom yelled at me, i wanted to laugh in her face, but i 'pretended' like i cared. but i didn't. i couldn't care less. the only way ppl effect me is with their choice of words. and then she mumbled that im lucky im not like her, b/c it's hard to care about what ppl say and wat she says to ppl, and i take the easy way by showing that i don't care what i say or what others say to me
all i did was ask if there was anything i could take for back pain. well i found some medicine on the table. she just started blabbing on about how advil has anti-histamines or something like that??? and i said nvm i found some. then there was the slam on the table and the yelling. she thinks she knows me! hah! whatever. 

""are u nervous?""
""no, why?""
""you're biting ur nails, u never do that""
""first off, i've been biting my nails for two years, and u've never been around me enough to notice""

^ only one of many examples of how my own mother doesn't know me. and she always tries to know me, but i push her away b/c everything she says pisses me off. she would've known that i bite my nails by just living w/ me. she doesn't have to talk to me for 2 hours straight everyday like she expects us to do. i told her to go read a book about teenagers, b/c she reads books on everything : husbands, sons, depression, religion, menopause . . you don't need a book to learn all of this stuff, she has a husband, she should know what they're like, she has 2 sons, she should know what they're like, depression i can understand, but she should start taking her damn anti-depressants b/c she has depression and she denies it. religion? go read the bible, and go to church. and menopause i can understand.  but damn. my dad is TRYING to be a better husband. but she refuses to accept that. she holds grudges for ever! she can't even see that he's changed b/c she thinks of him as he was when he was 30 or 40 raising ""us kid's"" i thought going to a psychiatrist or w/e would help. but i guess i was wrong."

Mrs. York expects so much more out of me. when i work harder than most ppl there, but do u see her yelling at them for doing a bad job? NO, but u see her yell at them for acting like children, i don't act like a child, yet i still get yelled at! And she also yells at me for what i've been doing at the zoo. It's mostly Not my fault! i have to work harder to just go behind Nick and get everything he doesn't, which is a lot. Yet im the one to blame. it's always MY fault, and yet my point again.. 15!! This pissed me off all day. And i have a concert tonight. oh yay? riiight.  People kept trying to talk to me. and i REALLY, REALLY didn't want to talk! i think i pissed some ppl off w/ that too. some ppl just don't understand, if im pissed. Dont Get In My Way. I'll talk to U, when i FEEL like it. and if u try to cheer me up, it'll come off as annoying to me. unless it's a guy, for some reason they just act sweet about it, girls just want you to be happy so they don't have to feel bad. fucken bullshit.

i have to argue w/ my mom so i can stay here this weekend. Which will make me EVEN MORE pissed! i haven't even told her that i have a concert tonight.woops, my bad.

"event","okay, this is sorta my venting over alex.. yes.. feel special alex. although ur gonna look at this and say ""what the hell"", anyways.. im just gonna list what im thinking about as it comes.. what im about to say, might be inturperited differently to different ppl. but i need to get it off of my mind b4 it explodes.

the whole daisy thing: it's pissing me off ""i really wanna take daisy to prom, but she hates me"" and apparently everyone knows this?oh, and i know who she is. im not stupid. 

which brings me to ur xanga site.. i've been secretly reading it.. that's sorta how brooke found it, i told her about it. i don't care what u say in it.. b/c it is were u can vent.. and i think im gonna stop reading it b/c it gets me in a bad mood. and i don't think i need to be reading some of that shit.. b/c it puts stupid ideas in my head.. sorta like some of my friends.. 

which brings me to bonnie.. (how u may ask? well, it just does) 2 1/2 years.. that's a long fucking time.. and ppl tell me that ur still not over her.. they tell me i shoulda never went out with u b/c of it.. and that any girl u'd go out w/ would end up getting hurt b/c of it.. just to let you know what's been filling my brain w/ lately.. and dont' think im regretting ever meeting u or something.. b/c ur a really awesome guy.. and im as serious as i could ever be.. and ppl probably think im being really mushy or something.. but who cares.. im bad w/ words..so awesome is the only way i can describe u.. but the past few weeks, i've felt like old, dirty laundry or something.. like 'oh, don't worry about lauren, or how SHE feels.. fuck her. i dont care about her' and through all of that.. this has built up.. but i think it's all getting better.. and im sooo happy about it. the only thing that is bugging me now. is the daisy thing.. yet again. it makes me feel like im at the bottom of ur 'so-called wish list' i guess u could say. but when im with u, it feels like nothing matters.. it's just u and me.. and all problems disappear.

i guess this is a little late to vent about this.. but better late then never as some say. 

this week is gonna be really busy.. tuesday and wednesday, im gonna be studying my ass off for dog obedience, then on thursday and most of friday i'll be in columbus for the dog obedience contest.. and that night it's sarah's b-day party. And then that leaves Saturday open. thank god.. which brings me to sunday.  ya.. church is half of that day. and then there's probablly homework from missing school on thursday and friday. what a week. but that also means i wont have to worry about that contest (arg, very stressfull)

i hope no one was offended.. b/c that wasn't my intent. usually i wouldn't care.. but im already stressed about dog obedience.. and believe it or not.. when ppl i care about are mad or angry w/ me.. it makes me really mad, or upset.. 

oh, on a sad note.. Randy'd huskie got ran over by jame's big ass truck, which just got new mudd tires.. i think the dog is going into the the vet hospital today. i feel really bad about it. i know he's a really, REALLY big jerk.. all the time.. but he really cares about that dog.  Jared and him are gonna share an apartment or something like that.. i think he's also gonna be a brusher bather at pestsmart. i haven't heard from Whitney in a long time.. i think im gonna call her.. see who her 'flavor of the week' is this week. . . okay, im joking. she's not a slut. i joke around w/ her about it thoe.. like how brooke is a whore on the corner of N.O .. only that's true. :p anyways.. i also have homework. stupid julius caesar.  oh, i took a quiz on what drug im most likely gonna do.. and it said 87% inhalents.. lmao.. ""where's some spray paint? *sniiiiiiiifff*"" and 75% weed.. and then X.. it's on quizfarm.com  if u ever wanna find it and take it."

"event","wow, i haven't updated in a while. well i feel sick. not sick enough to waste my time at a doctor's office, but sick enough to not go to the concert or school. 

i was thinking about not trying out for drum major, but then i thought that if i don't try out, then 'she' would have it all easy. But i really wanna do the DDR tournament! Some one needs to make sure justin 'advertizes' it. So ppl will actually come. And we cam make some money! oh we should also figure out when we're going to koto bukies again.

i finally watched Saiyuki requiem. it rocked. then me and my mom watched Spanglish. i feel asleep b4 the movie was half over. Everyone was calling me!! frist 2 times was my Dad. then jared actually called. but all he had to say was "" Ashley is gonna call you, when u pick up the phone say ' F*** off B****' and hang up"" i was like w/e. She actually called, i could barely understand what she was saying. but i figured out she asking me about 'my new boyfriend'(imagine saying that in a really kiddie voice, and that's ashley for ya) i just said that i was watching a movie w/ my mom (actually i was asleep, but oh well). so she told me to call her back. riiiiight. Then brooke called. ""so u didn't come? steirman was pissed"" ya... all i have to say is screw steirman. it's not like they needed me. 7th chair flute, doesn't sound important to me. i'd challenge ppl, but im happy where i am sitting. 

i went to sleep at 8:30 last night! and then i wake up at 8:00 this morning. that's a lot of sleep. i had a really weird dream.. i think it was from the tylenol sinus medicine. ""i was in a store, like krogers or something and i was supposed to find everyone in my friends family to tell them that we were done shopping (there were a lot of ppl!) and these 2 guys i've never met b4 came up to me and said 'are u hungry?' in a really flirty way.. and i just walked off and ignored them. well later on they did it again. but this time i said "" NO, and f*** off!"" they looked at me like i was the coolest person ever, so i paused and looked at them. the said 'okay, ur following us now, ur awesome' so i just followed them around everywhere, occasionally finding members of the family and telling them we were going to leave soon so meet up at the dairy section, or something like that. The two guys seemed like they were hiding from some one, so we'd always have to hide some where out of the blue. Then we were in this little hide out thing. And the two guys turned into demons and flew off. i was like 'okay,' and went and found the rest of the family."" STRANGE huh?

now what am i gonna do all day? i guess i'll just have to figure that out by myself."

So i was tired.. which made me look sad/mad.. but on the inside I was HAPPY! *cheesey smile* yeeaaaaaaaaaaah!.. last night was awesome.

I think things are going great, but then i go and find out something that i can't even believe. It makes me question who really are my friends? actually it's more like Who can i really trust? okay, off topic.. but this morning i was getting ready for church. My mom was being a total biotch. Then when we were in the van. she made James brush his hair.. and then she said ""all three of us are just gonna burn in hell"" in the most serious tone ever!.. i fuckin' exploded. ""HOW CAN U SAY THAT?  UR STUPID!"" i yelled at her. i started crying. She was soo serious!.. that's wat got to me!.. i joke around somethimes.. but she said it soo seriously. For instance.. when Chris R. was stalking Alica H. everyone picked on him.. and i said.. ""he's gonna bust up in here w/ and AK47 and kill our asses.. and he'll curse us all to hell!"" yeah.. it was funny.. not serious. I wanted to hit her!.. if i didn't have any self-control i probabbly would have. I can't stand her anymore.. if u look at my relationship w/ her.. u'd probably think it's all rainbows and gumdrops.. but its just the front we put up. She only looks at a problem w/ only one side of it. Not both sides. She thinks i have no disipline. WTF?!??!!!!! she should see some other families. but no.. she doesn't think that way. okay.. there's all my problems.. that im willing to discuss.

Ag center: i got bitched at by my teacher, couldn't back talk because she's like a boss.  
START: i hung out w/ melissa D. before the bell rang, then i waited for Alex.. But i did see Sarah, and then Alex showed up.  (there was a little confusion of where we were supposed to meet)..i walked w/ him and david untill i had to turn around and go to the office. 
OGT's: the writing OGT was pretty easy. Only downside was this stupid guy who kept asking me for a cigg. He kept asking if i was lying and i said NO!.. uhrrgggg.. 
Home: rode the bus. stopped by leah's house.. she was getting her hair cut. then i walk home. I read my e-mail to pass the time. Alex shows up. I read Brooke's email.. it was sorta disturbing. We watched Full House and Gilmore girls. (lol).. ((the nice version)) Mom brings pizza home.. i ate too much. he harassed kweenie. And making out w/ a dog IS cheating babe.*lol*...i forgot i was ticklish behind the ears... Black Jack!.. who won? ""wat r u doing w/ the lights off in the kitchen?"".. ""nothing""..

One day, when the sun was shining bright outside and the critters were about, she stumbled upon a talking frog at the meadow.  She hoppes infront of it and squats down to it's level. ""Hello Mr. Frog!"" The girl says with a squeeky voice. The frog looks at her with confusion. ""ribbit..."" the frog says dissapointing the little girl. ""Why don't you talk like all of the frogs in the stories mamma reads me do?""  She stares blankly at the frog. ""ribbit."" The frog belches out. A tear runs down the girls cheeck. She cradles her head with both of her hands, covering her wet eyes. The Frog hops to the spot of grass next to the girl. ""ribbit."" The frog says once again. The girl rubs her eyes and pats the frog on it's back.  The frog starts making choking noises, and starts to jump in place.  The girl is frightened and doesn't know what to do.  The frog falls on it's back and turns frozen. Shocked, the girl starts to cry even more. She looks around and there is no one to be found. She picks up the frog and craddles it in her arms.  ""I'm sorry Mr. Frog!"" She yells, whith tears running down.  She kisses the frog.  ""I never meant to hurt you."" She starts to dig into the ground with her free hand, and sets the frog in it.  ""I love you,"" the girl wispers as she covers the frog with the dirt. 


Yeah.. that's my story.. i don't think there was a point to it.. but i wrote it off the top of my head.. well i sorta just wrote it as i thought of it.. it's funny how it was a 'talking frog' although it never talked.. Well if u were wondering that too.. it's because he had a mouse in its throat... yeah read between the lines biotch!! okay..yeah.. that wasn't noticable.. unless u can read minds or something.. hey that'd be sweet!"

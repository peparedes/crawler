"event","Ok, so I think it's finally sunk in that I'm on my own now.  My dad arrived safely at home, and I spend my days sitting alone in my aunt's house (that is, until I start Frosh Orientation tomorrow and then school on Monday).  But I'm feeling pretty good because I've been talking to most of my friends back home, and I even got ahold of a friend in Arizona that I hadn't talked to since September.  I promise, Hana, that I will check out the tea situation as soon as I get slightly more situated."

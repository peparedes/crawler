"event","Wow i havn't written in this for a long time!!! I can't believe how bad i made my life sound in the other entries. Iv looked over my sisters and I'm surprised! but thats what i get for even doing this journal thing. Well i havn't done anything bad lately if i havn't told u what i did before when me and my friends snuck guys over, i smoked, drank and got caught sneaking out. Thats not bad at all compared to everyone else where i live and that sounds bad but whatever. I don't really have anything to say and this is a bad entry but thats my life boring and not that bad. I over exsadurate*** and i don't know how to spell."

"event","AHHHHHHH!!!! Im sooooo confused! Have you ever felt that only one person could help you feel better? That that one person can help you with anything? That one person is your best friend EVER? How 'bout when you find out that this one person dosn't seem to care about you as much as you care about them? Or when they say family before freinds and they totally do the opposite! Well this one person is my sister! I hate that she had to go to collage!!! She has all of these friends and isnt even here to see me be like her!!! I hate knowing that when she comes here she only wants to be with her best friend!!! I hate going threw life without her here! OK im not upsest with her but i miss her alot! Ok, well before i cry or get even more anoying im going on! Today was halloween and i went trick-or-teating, didnt really want to but whatever! umm nothing really happend except guys kept calling out to us and and following us and throughing eggs at us but they missed and we ran. so im over typing, later!

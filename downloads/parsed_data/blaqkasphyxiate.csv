I never did one of these posts when I first made this journal, so I&#39;m doing one now. My journal is at its core, friends only. I may have a few entries set to public, but if you really want to read my journal, I have to let you in.

Comment to be added, lovelies.

"event","I&#39;ve done another friends cut, trimming out people who I either don&#39;t feel I connected with, or haven&#39;t posted in a long time.

No hard feelings if I&#39;ve cut you, and I wish you the best!"

"event","Before I make a post about the crazy goddamn day I had, I did a friends list cut. I&#39;m sorry if I deleted you and you feel I shouldn&#39;t have - either you hadn&#39;t updated in a long time, or we just did not click.&nbsp;

If you&#39;re still here, yay! Glad to have you."

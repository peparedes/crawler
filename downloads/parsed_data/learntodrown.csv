im fucking coughing and all that shit so i go to shoppers and get some cough syrup and proceded to drink far to much of it too fast....so im all spun and not quite sure whats going on from about 1 til 5 at work...i had to take a 20 minute nap in the back room. so then i go to the set your goals show and im still out of it and im hanging out with andrea from barrie (a whole other story)

so then during dagger mouth i wasnt even in the pit just chillin but i get clocked by some big guy and get all dazed again....so then i get phone calls from ppl telling 
then while i was waiting for ppl at sherbourne station i get a phone call from my brother saying mark just punched both him and evan in the head...so i flip and almost bust it over to antos to give someone i once called my best friend the beat down of a life time but margy stopped me becucase she reminded me that i was sick and mark is kinda psycho...

so we get to the pheonix and im there and have like 2 drinks and start feeling sketchy then get a big hug from behind from Andrea from work and her bf appears and gives me serious cut eye all night

then by drink 3 i started feeling really sketchy so i hopped a cab home

"event","so it has been a really shitty week
quite a few things went down this week, all of which i coulda dealt with on their own, but it was just one after another after another after another...
it was to the point where i was out with some of my closest friends last night and i still couldnt have a very good time because i had so much on my mind

and the funny part is when i went to sacha's the other night to bitch, her mom totaly thougth we hooked up and asked sacha where i was in the morning becuase she thought i slept over4 and me and sacha banged all night. i infact was in bed by 12 that night

so hopefully this week will be the week of all these things becoming resolved. and if not, im going ot stay with kele in ottawa in 3 weeks, so hopefully i'll just drown myself at work until then"

"event","ok, this is the abridged version, as close to in order as can be pieced together at this time

got to alex's
drunken dancing and such
saw old faces
saw older faces
everyone got really drunk
counted down
think i mighta kissed somebody...nto too sure though
spray champagne everywhere
random phone calls/texts
mark tried to crowdsurf on the lineup for the bathroom
people started puking
landlord showed up and party got shut down
i walked to somewhere around bathurst and stclair before my drunkeness got the best of me and i grabbed a cab and went home(sorry bowsky)
went to sleep, and woke up at 530 in the morning to drunk to get outta bed and couldnt fall back asleep til like 10
had a million texts when i woke up


and now for my resolution:
i guess it would to figure out what I want to do with myself. yea, theres a little more to that than just what i wanna do schoolwise or anyhting like that. it's more figure out what i want outta friends, relationships, and everyhitng like that. i wanna start doing things for myself, what i want to do. not saying that anybody stopped me from doing anyhting before...or at least not directly, or even knowingly, but there were many(or was it few, im not really sure, nor does it matter) things i didnt do out fo fear of what those close ot me would say or think.
no more, this is for me
...and it all comes down to this...


and i gotta say...2007WHAT!...sorry, had to be there for that one"

"event","less than 11 months until im gone and have left this town with its places and people and sights and stories behind
i dont plan on going forever, but i dont know what will happen
i've spent the last little while thinking alot aobut the relationships i have with all of the people i know here...and have come to the conclusion that there are really only a small handful of those friendships which will stay with me. the few people i will miss i think i will miss them dearly. but in the last little while after telling alot of the people who are close to me about my plans i've been written off
i've been told im leaving for all the wrong reasons

so, despite the fact that none of these people read this i am not leaving because
1. i hate it here
2. i hate what i've become...although that took a little bit of tim to figure out
3. i hate the people here
4. there is nothing here for me anymore'
and most importantly,
5. i'm running from a certain person.

that last one needs some clairity. sometimes multiple things happen at the same time in someone's (my) life. but they have absolutely nothing to do with one another. i am not leaving because of what happened...if i was i would have left right away and not sorted out a relationship with one of the most important people i ever have and ever will know and care about.

but now that i am leaving and it is set in stone im fucking glad. i get to see who actually cares about me, i get to see who wishes me the best, and most importantly who is continuing to be my friend until i get on that train. i've already started to phase the illwishers and selfish fucks out of my life.
so, i guess if you hear from me in the next 11 months or so, know that you mean something to me.

and to set the record straight, i'm leaving for 2 reasons
1. to get get a fresh start because if i dont do this now i never will...and i'll never be able to grow and become the person i want to be
2. because i didnt have the balls to do this 2 years ago.

the people i love mean more to me than anything.

and i hope that now i have all my thoughts on the matter sorted out...because i can say i've really been a not so pleasent person to talk to and be around lately becuase of all of this on my chest.

"event","damn i'm good....i pull this shit once a month... 
well good isnt the word for it...but i pull it nonetheless. 
almost like fucking clockwork. 
i really gotta stop, but i have to get my thoughts in check first and figure out why my frustration causes me to take it out on the person who means more than anyhting to me. 
and i also have to&nbsp;figure out whats frustrating me and causing me so much ...(ugh) angst. 
it's this entire chain reaction... 
1. figure out whats been bothering me 
2. figure out why i take it out on those i care about 
3. stop hurting said person 


easier said than done...i guess"

"event","i was bored this afternoon and because i was feeling under the weather for various reasons i didnt feel up for leaving the house. so i cleaned my room, right down to ripping all the posters and shit off of my walls. i mean i'm 20 years, should i really have 6 year old magazine cut outs of rollerbladers and punkrock stars all over my space. the best part is that there are all these different shades of blue form where and how much the paint faded and got dirty.
now i need some paint, some picture and record frames...maybe some new furniture...or maybe for that lottery ticket to win so i can actually afford a real space of my own

AGAIN) and searching for a real job, I have managed to read a few good books.<br /><br />Watership Down- supprisingly good, for a story about anthropomorphic brittish rabbits.<br /><br />Kitchen Confidential - I like Anthony Bourdain No Reservations.&nbsp; I like his dry, sarcastic sense of humor and how he's not PC.&nbsp; I liked this book too.&nbsp; It was a super quick read.&nbsp; I read it driving&nbsp;from Lancaster to Bayone, New Jersey, with a random nap thrown in here and there (ok, I wasn't driving, I was a passanger).&nbsp; Its mostly about the time in Bourdain's life before he started traveling around the world.&nbsp; And before his divorce.<br /><br />The Professor and the Madman: A tale of murder, insanity and the making of the oxford english dictionary -- more interesting than you might think (and my family thought I had lost it when I broke this book out &quot;a story about the <em>dictionary</em>?&quot;)&nbsp; Because the dictionary hasn't been in existance for that long.&nbsp; Its pretty recent in the grand scheme of books and language.<br /><br />The Alchemist - I read it again and I still LOVE it.<br /><br />By the River Piedra I Sat Down&nbsp;and Wept- again, another book by Paulo Coelho that is simply amaing.</p><p>House of Many Ways - the sequel to Howl's Moving Castle.&nbsp; It was wicked good.&nbsp; I loved it.&nbsp; but then again, I like most of the books I read.&nbsp; haha!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yeah, and then there is that time when I went on a CRUISE to BERMUDA!!!!!&nbsp; It was just a week ago and I miss it so much.&nbsp; Bermuda was so beautiful.&nbsp; I, however, would have to marry a local to live there full time.&nbsp; Either that or spend 1.5 million for a house and then I could only spend 5 months a year there.&nbsp; Darn.<br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p><br />So... its been quite a while since I last wrote in here.&nbsp; Student teaching will begin in just about two weeks.&nbsp; I'm not nervous yet, but I'm sure if you talk to me on January 15, I'll be a little more nervous.&nbsp; Anywhoo... I hope (hope, hope, hope) that my other journal, on blogger, will be where I post about student teaching.&nbsp; I honestly just need to schedule in blogger writing time into my schedule, around teaching and exercising.&nbsp; <br /><br />Speaking of exercising... I'm really, really trying to get back into the swing of running.&nbsp; so far, Sunday and today, I've been walking for one minute then running (jogging) for two minutes.&nbsp; I've done that for 20 minutes.&nbsp; I'm shooting for running again tomorrow to get back on the <a href=""http://www.nike.com/europerunning/flash/train/pdfs/beginners-5k.pdf"">schedule</a> that I have.&nbsp; After about four more weeks, I should be able to run for about 20 minutes straight, granted this is on the treadmil, so as long as I can do that,&nbsp;I can work my way to running on the road.&nbsp; The reason for this running, aside from getting back into shape and losing weight is that this summer the fam is going on a CRUISE!!!&nbsp; We're going to Bermuda.&nbsp; And it is my goal to fit into and purchase <a href=""http://www.landsend.com/pp/BeachLivingSolidVneckSwimTop~166795_593.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::TVY&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_00006__0000000650&amp;origin=index"">this</a>.&nbsp; Basically I just want to find a bathing suit that I feel comfortable in and if I happen to look good then that is just a plus.&nbsp; I also need to find some sun dresses and a more formal dress for the cruise too.&nbsp; But I'll cross that bridge when I get there.<br /><br />What else... I'm seriously considering going into the peace corps when I get done with school.&nbsp; I'd like to teach english somewhere.&nbsp; I'm afraid of filling out the app now because they might send me away before I go on the cruise.&nbsp; And I want to go on the cruise.&nbsp; I've been scouring the internet to find when people who teach english leave America, but most of the blogs dont give much information on when they left the country.&nbsp; I'm thinking if I fill out the application about four months before August (when I want to leave) then that will almost guarantee that I'll be able to go on the cruise.&nbsp; So if I start the application in April, and because the peace corps is a governmental thing which will take a while to go through all the red tape, I'll know if I'm doing that or if I need to start filling out teaching applications and finding an apartment.&nbsp; I should really fill out the application now, or at least by Feb or March.&nbsp; And I need to tell my parents about my decision to do this.&nbsp; I just want to get out and expericen the world.&nbsp; And travel.&nbsp; And teach.&nbsp; Going to Canada doesn't really count as going out of the country, cause we're so close and so similar.&nbsp; It would be like the British going to Scotland or Ireland.&nbsp; They're just really similar, and the language is the same, (even french for canada) but culturally very similar.&nbsp; Me going to like Romania or China&nbsp;or something is stepping out of the zone that I'm so comfortable with.&nbsp; And it would just really kick some serious ass for me to be able to say &quot;I did this!&nbsp; what have you done with your life?&nbsp; got married and popped out a kid?!&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I went to a foreign country, learned a new language and lived on my OWN for two years.&quot;&nbsp; Not that I'd rub it in or anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, I've posted enough and need to do some thinking and probably take a shower (since I haven't and I've run and went for a hike up Mt. Prospect, but only to the first rest area)&nbsp; Let me know what you think of my possible life plans!!</p><p>Bisous!</p>"

Yeah, so I think that milk, and maybe even dairy in general, is giving me headaches.&nbsp; They may even be migraines, but I&quot;m not sure.&nbsp; This weekend when I was home, Friday night I had a huge glass of milk and woke up the next morning with a headache.&nbsp; I went to work at the lantern and thought that it was all the chemicals that were giving me a headache.&nbsp; After I got home, it got worse.&nbsp; I could still kinda function, but I dind't want to.&nbsp; the headache I had was concentrated in my temples.&nbsp; So I decided to go as dairy free as I could for five days.&nbsp; Today at lunch I&nbsp;had three spoonfulls of corn chowder, and now I have a headache.&nbsp; Not as bad as Friday, but still bad enough so that my extra strength excedrine isn't helping.

I dont think these headaches are stress related.&nbsp; I'm stressed, but not super stressed.&nbsp; I dont know.&nbsp; I'll have to do another experiment tonight and have a glass of milk with dinner and see what happens.&nbsp; I'll have to remember to have dinner dairy free except for the milk.&nbsp; Wish me luck!"

So (and I dont remember if i posted about this or not) a few weeks ago roomie's mom spent the night.&nbsp; Not that I really care if she has guests, but if they're spending the night in our room, it would have been nice if I had been told.&nbsp; But I wasn't.&nbsp; Mom just randomly showed up, I was kinda introduced and then at like 10 pm or something, they both went to be.&nbsp; Nice.

but this weekend, the boyfriend is over.&nbsp; Again, I was NOT told that there was going to be someone sleeping in our room.&nbsp; And, as a side note, what is the appeal of spending the weekend in a dorm room?&nbsp; And he's older, so I'm assuming that he has an apartment or something.&nbsp; So yeah, it was a generally sucky weekend.&nbsp; Lets see.&nbsp; Friday night, after I had to listen to them whispering sweet nothings in eachothers ears, decided that no one would die if I left the room.&nbsp; So I slept in a suitemate's room.&nbsp; then saturday night, I was exhausted, so 11:30 rolls around and I decided to go to bed.&nbsp; At 12:30, they come in, and of course, as roomie ALWAYS does, she jumps on the computer and types, types, types!&nbsp; Oh, but get this, her screen saver isn't scheduled to go on for at least an hour!&nbsp; So, now I'm awake, pretending to be sleeping and hating the world and cursing their children.&nbsp; Oh, and they didn't do anything, or if they did, they were sooo quite that I couldn't hear.&nbsp; anyway, so 2 am rolls around and I&quot;m frustrated to the point of tears, so I get up and go out into the common room to read for a bit.&nbsp; I get tired at 2:30 and get back int bed.&nbsp; and the screen saver is on.

I need to have a chat with this girl.&nbsp; Because this is getting past the point of rediculous.&nbsp; I can put up with a lot of shit... this semester.&nbsp; Next semester is going to be a whole different story.&nbsp; I am not going to put up with anything if I am still living with her and I'm student teaching.&nbsp; sorry.&nbsp; I'll turn into an uber bitch if I have to.&nbsp; Which I think that I'm starting to turn into one right now.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; I just want a single."

Controlled kicks work your hips, thighs and butt while complex combinations that include punches will target your abs to make them stronger. A 140-lb woman will burn up to 500 calories with 45 minutes of kickboxing.<br /><br />so yay me for burning up to 500 cals (and probably more moving my junk around).<br /><br /><br />whatever.&nbsp; I've put homework off long enough.&nbsp; And its nearing bedtime!</p>"

"event","I finally finished that damn plastic crochet bag!&nbsp; It looks a little&nbsp;something like <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/linzspence/AdventuresInCrochet/photo#5203963545074841410"">this</a> and <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/linzspence/AdventuresInCrochet/photo#5203963613794318162"">this</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; Don't know what my next project will be.&nbsp; I also finished a book last night too.&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Novel-Gregory-Maguire/dp/0060988657/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211642471&amp;sr=8-1"">Mirror Mirror</a>, it was alright.&nbsp; I have recently become, well, fascinated, for lack of a better word, with Cinderella stories.&nbsp; Most of my reading has happened online, which is not a lot, but I did rewatch Disney's Cinderella and liked it, but didn't like it at the same time.&nbsp; Its too sterile.&nbsp; I kind of like the blood and gore of Grimm, and Cinderella is bloody and gory.&nbsp; I'm in search of a storybook, like a picture book, that is much closer to the ending of the Grimm story, which is the step mom/sisters get their eyes pecked out by birds.&nbsp; I also think there is another ending where the mom has to dance in red hot iron shoes, which I like better than birds, but I dont remember if its Cinderella or another story.&nbsp; Another thing that I have decided to do is to collect (I guess) Cinderella stories from different countries or races/religions of people for my classroom.&nbsp; I'm not guaranteed that I'll have a diverse classroom depending on where I go, but if I'm in a more urban area my chances of having a diverse classroom are higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of my fav Cinderella stories from my children's lit class are not the french or german Cinderella.&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Yeh-Shen-Paperstar-Book-Ai-Ling-Louie/dp/0698113888/ref=cm_lmf_tit_8_rsrsrs0"">Yeh-Shen</a> is a beautiful Cinderella story from China.&nbsp; The pictures are very pretty too.&nbsp; I'd be able to give more information if I actually had the real book infront of me.&nbsp; I tend to think that I'm now the world authority on children's literature because of my class.&nbsp; Anyway, my second fav Cinderella is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rough-Face-Girl-Rafe-Martin/dp/0698116267/ref=cm_lmf_tit_9_rsrsrs0"">The Rough Faced Girl</a>, an American Indian Cinderella, Algonquin, so its almost in our neck of the woods.&nbsp; This is another beautiful story.&nbsp; I think that this one more than any other Cinderella story shows that beauty is not how you look on the outside, but how beautiful you are on the inside.&nbsp; The one thing that I dont like is *spoiler ahead :D ) that in the end, the Cinderella character is transformed to look as beautiful as she is on the inside.&nbsp; I mean, I guess it works because the prince likes her for her personality and stuff, but whatever.&nbsp; I didn't write it.<br /><br />Eh... I need to find something else to do... like finish cleaning my room.&nbsp; Or watching tv.&nbsp; Or exercising.&nbsp; Or finding another project to do.&nbsp; Or find a new book to read/ finish one of the 7 books that I tried to read during the school year (I'm embarrassed)."

"event","&nbsp;So, not a whole lot has been going on.&nbsp; I've been kinda sick for the past few days, which my parents/sister have had a field day with (I was complaining that I was cold all the time) until yesterday.... when my mom got sick and appologized for teasing me because now she is cold/sick.&nbsp; Vindication!&nbsp; No, I feel bad for her because it sucks.&nbsp; On the work front... nothing.&nbsp; Its been super slow, and chef has had to cut a lot of people until it gets busy again.&nbsp; And... I have a second job.&nbsp; I will be cleaning rooms at the Lantern.&nbsp; Probably wont start until about Father's Day, but thats ok.&nbsp; I'm thinking that the Lantern will be 5 days/week and the Cabot will be about 4.&nbsp; The Cabot has every Sunday off, restaurant and bar closed (which doesn't make much senses) and I probably wont work on Mondays and Tuesdays.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; I hope that I'll get called for Memorial day.&nbsp; They should be open that whole weekend.&nbsp; But for now, I guess I'll just help out around the house as much as I can, try to wean myself from the TV and finish my books and finish my crochet projects.

I was hoping to go outside today to get some reading done, but its wicked windy and looks like its just going to open up and rain, so I'm thinking today is another inside day.&nbsp; I had a list of things to do, but I lost it and forgot what i had to get done.&nbsp; I know that it had laundry, dishes and cleaning my room on it, but I know I had some other things on it.&nbsp; Oh, running and shower.&nbsp; In that order.&nbsp; I've been soo lax about exercising, even though I'm not happy with my body.&nbsp; well, yeah, not happy.&nbsp; I mean, my body is ok, I know that if I wanted to , it could be a lot worse, but&nbsp;I was sooo good about exercising when I was at school and now I'm just lazy and lazy.

Oh, and my eating has been a little less than stellar.&nbsp; I need to work on that too.&nbsp; I'm pretty healthy.&nbsp; Breakfast could be a lot better.&nbsp; Today was two homemady biscuits (made by yours truly!) and a Dunkins bagle with cream cheese and I'm working on a large hazelnut iced coffee (yum).&nbsp; And prevous days haven't been any better.&nbsp; I either eat breakfast that isn't that good or I skip, which is bad.

Eh... I need to get some stuff done and try to peel myself away from this NCIS marathon... I love crime dramas!!"

anyways, on a more positive note, I bought these really fabulous sandals from Rite-aid today for a little under 8 bucks.&nbsp; Ok, so they're not that fabulous.&nbsp; But they're black and more dressy than the crappy dirty old navy sandals that I've been running around in for, well, ever.

also diet/exercise has been lax.&nbsp; I ran yesterday, monday, and it was pathetic.&nbsp; I couldn't even make it Powder Hill.&nbsp; The last time I was home and went running, I easily made it to Blackberry Lane, which is about a half mile from my house.&nbsp; I didn't run today, but tomorrow I""m going to the dump and back.&nbsp; Maybe running on flats will be easier than uphill!"

The good news is that my face isn't peely, just my lips.&nbsp; And my face doesn't hurt.&nbsp; And most of the time it looks ok.&nbsp; I've found that a little makeup make is look pretty good, so I need to add that to my get ready for school routine.&nbsp; Oh, I've also found an amazing facewash...honey.&nbsp; It makes my face super smooth.&nbsp; I haven't tried straight honey since starting accutane, since my skin is becoming paper thin.&nbsp; I do equal parts honey and cetaphil.&nbsp; I've heard that smearing honey on your face and letting it sit for 10 minutes is supposed to feel wonderful.&nbsp; And I think I'll do straight honey tonight, just to experiment, cause I'm feeling reckless!"

"event","so, today kinda sucks.&nbsp; and I'm throwing myself a pity party!&nbsp; My lips are annoying me.&nbsp; I have to lube them up like every 30 minutes.&nbsp; And my scalp itches, I have dry skin and my room smells like tuna fish (because I decided that bringing back a tuna sandwich would be a good idea... wrong!).&nbsp; I can deal with the lips and the skin, but my scalp.&nbsp; I'm going to look like I have lice or dandruff or some combo of the two.&nbsp; And that means that I probably can't wear my hair down around people.

oh, so when I woke up my lips were sooo chapped.&nbsp; Like, nothing i've ever seen before.&nbsp; And I counted four new pimples.&nbsp; two of which popped when I washed my face and two are just glaring at me when I look in the mirror *shakes fist*.&nbsp; I think this means that I'm going to start to see some more breakouts within the next four to five days.

I think I'll just snuggle under a blanket and forget about the world for a while... and watch a movie."

"event","<p>&nbsp;Well, another dull weekend here on KSC.&nbsp; What I'm supposed to be doing is cleaning my room, writing a couple of papers and working on my art project for Seminar.&nbsp; what I'm acutally doing is... nothing.&nbsp; Well, I ate, watched some TV, went to Walmart and now I'm doing this.&nbsp; My art project isn't that hard, its just that I have to shuffle some things around to get to it.&nbsp; Eh... I'll get around to it.&nbsp; Maybe a little later, when there is absolutely nothing on tv.<br /><br />workout/diet has been going ok.&nbsp; I didn't go to the gym yesterday.&nbsp; I ended up falling asleep after my 8am class and didn't wake up until 4pm.&nbsp; Yeah, I slept from 10am to 4pm... and it was glorious!&nbsp; And I'm still thinking if I should go to the gym today,&nbsp;I did walk to walmart.<br /><br />And accutane... oh accutane.&nbsp; I've been on it for a little more than a week.&nbsp; I've taken 10 pills, but had to skip a pill or two so that my 30 pills and my 34 day wait are even.&nbsp; damn you fda.&nbsp; anyway, I think my face is a little less red and angry looking.&nbsp; Not so much as cleared up, but does look better.&nbsp; Its hard to tell because I try to avoid taking pictures of myself.&nbsp; the real people to ask would be my parents.&nbsp; I dont know when the next time I'll see them is.&nbsp; I do need to start cleaning out my room and bringing some stuff back home so that moveout day won't be a complete disaster.&nbsp; </p><p>Ok, its official, I've wasted enough time and now I have to accomplish something.</p>"

"event","&nbsp;Ok, maybe not.&nbsp; But there is some serioush crushage going on.&nbsp; the bad news is that I'm pretty sure he has a girlfriend.&nbsp; Or if not, knowing my luck, he has a boyfriend ;)&nbsp; anyway, its this guy in my lit class.&nbsp; He's gorgrous.&nbsp; He's probably a little under 6' tall.&nbsp; Dark hair, peircing blue eyes... you know the ones where you can see right through them *girlish squeel*... aannnddd he's super nice to me.&nbsp; I dont think it will go anywhere, but I'll try to put my best flirt on while I can.&nbsp; anyway, the reason for this sudden obsession, besides realizing that I will never be able to be with David Boreanaz (too bad, cause he's hawt) and we've been talking a little bit after class.&nbsp; And on top of that, it makes me feel good about myself to have a little guy attention.&nbsp; On top of exercising (I made it through hump day!! and am moving on to days four and five) and taking my meds, I'm begining to feel better about me.&nbsp; Granted the meds are starting to make me break out a bit, but that is expected.&nbsp; And it is my supreme hope that buy July (aka Leah's wedding) I will have slimmed down a bit (20 lbs isn't asking too much I think, but I'd be good with 10-15) my face should have cleared up a lot too (I really hope!).

the only thing that I need to do with my exercise program is a little weight training.&nbsp; I dont like to do that here.&nbsp; running and being self consious about rocking the uniboob is about all I can handle.&nbsp; I dont want to go down to man-land, the weight room, and feel weird.&nbsp; Hopefully if I go back to the mountain view I might be able to use their gym to do some weight training before I go home.&nbsp; I'll have to see how that works out.&nbsp; I'd like to do breakfast again, with a few banquets here and there for some extra cash.&nbsp; Oh well, I have to get a ton of reading done before class."

"event","Yes, I'm bored and avoiding work.

Yeah, went running again today.&nbsp; Trying to make it over the three day hump.&nbsp; so that means by wednesday I'll be back in the swing of things.&nbsp; anyway, so my run.&nbsp; ran 6 laps, walked 1 and stretched my poor tight calves, ran four more than walked one for a cool down.&nbsp; so all in all it was a pretty good run.&nbsp; I figure if I could go the whole mile, I'd be able to do it in about 10 minutes... which is wicked slow, but whatever.&nbsp; and my eating has been pretty good too.&nbsp; So anyway, my next goal after getting through hump day is to get to three weeks exercising every day except saturday and sunday.&nbsp; I might go for walks on weekends, but nothing super hard."

"event","<p>So I decided to get off my butt and go for a run.&nbsp; and I did!&nbsp; At the gym, in my comfy new running shoes, still pristine if I do say so myself... I ran six laps, which is just a tad over a 1/2 mile.&nbsp; then I walked two and ran three (or two, I lost count) and walked one more.&nbsp; Which makes my run 1 and 1/11th miles.&nbsp; woohoo!&nbsp; but for the first lap or two, my back was killing me.&nbsp; I haven't decided if its the meds or because I'm fat and out of shape.&nbsp; And for dinner, I had a turkey wrap, small salad (mostly lettuce, some beans and two broccoli florettes, w/ vinegar and olive oil *yum*) and h20 to drink.&nbsp; And then I went <strike>home</strike> (haha) back to the dorm room and had some easter candy that Gram was late in giving me.&nbsp; And now I'm currently working on a low sodium V8, in which I added some salt to.&nbsp; go figure.<br /><br />Other than that... accutane as been going ok.&nbsp; No noticible side effects as of yet, other than the wicked cotton mouth about 30 minutes after I take it.&nbsp; But dry skin and the such... other than an itchy scalp (which is exactly what people wanted to hear) I dont have much of anything going on.&nbsp; I think it might be because I'm starting out on a low dose.&nbsp; this month is only 40 mgs a day, next month is 40 mgs twice a day.&nbsp; And I also think that it is fat soluble, so it might take a while to get into my system.&nbsp; But I definately think that it is working, cause of the cotton mouth.&nbsp; And I think my face is a little less oily (I'll have to skip the moisturizer in the am to see) and a little less red.&nbsp; But my overhead light blew, so its a little dim in my room when I wake up and at night.&nbsp; I need to ask my dad about taking a fish oil capsule.&nbsp; I heard it supposed to relieve the muscle/joint aches as well as help the meds get absorbed.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; so much work for such a good cause.</p>"

"event","&nbsp;New shoes make the world a much better place.&nbsp; So on the 27th I finally got my scrip for accutane (well, I'm on amnesteen, which is just a generic version... and cheaper!&nbsp; only $5 for 30 pills... score!)&nbsp; And because of the fun, necessary laws (note sarcasm) that require me to visit my doctor every 30 days and get blood drawn, I have to go back.&nbsp; But wait!&nbsp; My doctor doesn't work on Fridays... and my day 30 lands on a friday... so I have to wait until Monday, but wait!&nbsp; Monday is full, so I'm going on Tuesday April 29.&nbsp; Which means that I go to my 10 am class, leave for St. J around 1, 1:30 (google maps tells me it will take me just a little over two hours from keene... and this means that I miss my 2pm class, right before finals week.&nbsp; The good news is that the 2pm class is my seminar, and as of today I've only missed one class... which is much less than some kids, so I think it will be ok.&nbsp; I just have to tell him.&nbsp; So to get back on track, my next appointment is four days later than my day 30.&nbsp; So I'm skipping a pill here and there so that I can take my last pill on the day of my next appointment.... *phew*&nbsp; I remember this being so much easier in high school.

As for side effects, none that I've noticed other than Ive been needing to apply chapstick a little more often that I normally do.&nbsp; but then again, it just could be because my house is pretty dry and in my dorm room I generally have a humidifier running for a couple hours a day, before I go to bed and when I wake up... its kinda loud.&nbsp; And no outbreaks yet.&nbsp; I think my skin is also a little less oily, but then i only took my second pill today (first pill was the 27th)&nbsp; We'll see in a week or two when I'm taking a pill every day.

On to shoes.&nbsp; I've been needing new running shoes and a pair of sneakers for a long time.&nbsp; So the fam and I went to north conway for a shopping trip.&nbsp; My running shoes have some magenta&nbsp;in them and my sneakers are Etnies and they're super cute.&nbsp; their white with little green and yellow stars scattered over them.&nbsp; I'll have to put pictures up.

As for my pathetic life... this is what it has come down to.&nbsp; I've recently discovered Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&nbsp; Lame, yes... dorky, totally... embarrassed to be admitting this, yes.&nbsp; But I like it and I've fallen even more in love with David Boraneaz (LOVE him on Bones.. can't wait for it to start again).&nbsp; I love Angel.&nbsp; so anyway.&nbsp; I've watched the first three seasons of Buffy online, and I found Angel series online too.&nbsp; So I get to the Angel episode ""I Will Remember You""... and for the last 10 minutes of the show and 10 minutes after the show has ended, I sobbed.&nbsp; Seriously, I do cry during movies and stuff, more so within the last year or so than in the rest of my life.&nbsp; but I never sob.&nbsp; I weep.&nbsp; This was not a normal cry for me, not that i cry a lot.&nbsp; But this was like body shaking, hard time breathing, coughing, sobbing kinda cry.&nbsp; I dont think it was the accutane.&nbsp; It was just one of the saddest things I've ever watched, because I like the tragic idea of Buffy and Angel being a couple and the ending was something I would expect in like a modern twist of Romeo and Juliet, without the death.&nbsp; I guess its something you have to watch to be able to know what I'm talking about, crying or no.&nbsp; I dont think I'll be watching that episode for a long, long time.&nbsp;

Continuing with my pathetic life, Buffy is all I can think about.&nbsp; Sad, I know.&nbsp; Well, when i got back to school, it wasn't such a big part of my day.&nbsp; But during spring break and this long weekend that I gave my self (haha... I was at school for Mon, Tues and left for home again Wednesday afternoon...hahaha) buffy, bones, psych and monk are all I can think about.&nbsp; I think this means that I dont have anything to worry about.&nbsp; And way too much free time.&nbsp; and this is kind of off topic, but my psych sem professor said that if you wake up with a song stuck in your head, then thats a good thing because you dont have any problems in your life right now that you need to think about and deal with.&nbsp; something to chew over.&nbsp; Now, I must think about buffy and angel and how they belong together... and I need to go to sleep."

"event","&nbsp;I was just wondering what happened to the world today.&nbsp; Maybe spring fever, but probably not with this fun little snow storm that we're getting now.&nbsp; Ok, maybe not snow storm, but its snowing...

Anywhoo... the reason for questioning the rotation of the earth is that Tom had a girl over.&nbsp; and it wasn't Lindsey.&nbsp; *I can hear the gasps of surprise*&nbsp; He's been pining over her for so long that it was really surprising to see him walk in the door with someone other than Lindsey.&nbsp; So they were in the family room for a while watching Across the Universe (cause I could hear it all the way downstairs).&nbsp; So about 9pm, when Cassie gets home from sports awards, she comes barrelling down the front stairs and looks at me and at the top of her whisper says ""They're making out!""&nbsp; And I""m pretty sure Cassie wouldn't lie.&nbsp; And I think her name is Elaine Frenette, and I""m pretty sure she has a little sister around cassie's age named Leah, which doesn't help me much.&nbsp;&nbsp;

So yes, something happened today and it was quite monumental.&nbsp; I'm still not sure what to make of it.&nbsp; I dont think any of us will get any information from Tom... he's in that ""Im the most important person in the world"" selfish stage of his life right now.&nbsp; but maybe *cross fingers* now that he's finally 100% over Lindsey, he'll turn back to normal."

"event","Well, last night totally sucked.&nbsp; I think I'm getting sick, and I'm exhausted, so I decided to finish my work quickly (which is something I dont normally do... I hold off till the last minute) and then go it bed.&nbsp; It was 9pm.&nbsp; I ended up watching a little family guy then called it a night.&nbsp; First I was cold, but I figured it was because I had been sitting next to a drafty window in shorts and a tanktop... no problem.&nbsp; Then five minutes later, I was boiling and my feet were wicked hot.&nbsp; so I kicked off all the blankets on my bed except for my sheet and this cotton blanket, I forget what its called, but it looks like it was weaved.&nbsp; Anway, so then I was cold again.&nbsp; So I decided to ignore it and try to sleep.&nbsp; 10 minutes later, under the same blankets I was boiling hot and my feet were hot again.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; So finally around 9:45 I fell asleep, only to wake up again at 11, 11-30.&nbsp; Couldn't sleep.&nbsp; Got up and went on the computer, watched the TED talks on youtube (cause I'm currently obsessed with them, expeciall the one by Michael Pollan and the one on the WorldWide Telescope)&nbsp; then around 1:30 I went back to bed.&nbsp; Woke up at 3, 4, and then was wide awake at 5:30, and have been up since then.&nbsp;&nbsp;I figure I got about 5 hours of sleep, maybe more, maybe less.&nbsp; I hope I make it throuh class today."

"event","so the other day, I talked ad nauseum about accutane and the iPLEDGE program.&nbsp; well, I finally got my user ID and password, and I thought that I would be able to take the test that they mandate that ""females of reproductive potential"" have to take monthly (if only I had taken that hysterectomy when I had the chance *jk, jk*)&nbsp; Anyway, so I jump on and this is what I see when I go to be a good, decent citizen and do what my government has asked me to do...<br /><br /><a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/linzspence/IAmJustANumber"">http://picasaweb.google.com/linzspence/IAmJustANumber</a><br /><br />and the next photo is the government telling me when I can go in for my next pregnancy test (March 26) and apparantly I can't take the test until my next visit with my dermatologist... after we have ""counseling"" aka ""lets talk about how stupid this is and how my birth control methods (abastainance and not getting any) are working for me and talk even more about the side effects of this drug on fetuses""&nbsp; then and only then can I take the test and get my drugs.&nbsp; I swear, if they did this for heroine or something, no one would be addicted, cause its a pain in the ass."

"event","so this is completely ridiculous.&nbsp; So I'm back on accutane for my acne.&nbsp; But wait, I'm not going to be on it for at least a month, maybe two.&nbsp; the FDA has decided that me, the doctor and the pharmacist have to jump through these ridiculous hoops just to be put on the medication.&nbsp; But here's the thing, its only for females of ""childbearing potential"".&nbsp; So guys, once again, get to skate by and get the help they need while the females who need the help have to have (I think) two negative pregnancy tests before they can take the medication.&nbsp; And we, the girls, also have to make a promise to the government that we will either abstain from sex for the entire course of the medication including the month before we go on the meds as well as one month after we stop the meds, ooooorrrrr we have to say what two forms of birth control we will go on.&nbsp; One form being horomonal (pill, patch, ring, shot, IUD, implant) non horomonal IUD, or getting my tubes tied (oh, this doesn't count if I've gone through menopause or if I dont have my reproductive organs).&nbsp; So these bc methods are the ""primary"" sources of bc.&nbsp; My secondary choices are spermacides, male condoms,diaphragm w/ spermacide, cervical cap w/ spermacide, vaginal sponge, and Plan B.

Ugh!

I chose to abstain as my primary source and use nothing as my secondary source :D&nbsp;( like I'm running around having unsafe sex anyway) because 1.&nbsp; the government doesn't need to know if I'm sexually active, its none of their damn business 2.&nbsp; even if I was having sex, I think I'm smart enough to know how to protect myself and 3.&nbsp; where is the responsibility of the guy?&nbsp; Seems to me to have heterosexual sex it takes a man and a woman.&nbsp; Why is it only my responsibility?&nbsp; yes, yes, I am the only one who can get pregnant, I understand that.&nbsp; But why is it only the women who have to go through basically sex ed and have a birth control workbook (swear to god, it says it right on the cover)&nbsp; Shouldn't guys who are going on the medication be aware of what could happen to babies?&nbsp;

Oh, and on top of studying my ""Isotretinoin Education Kit for Female Patients Who Can Get Pregnant: The Importance of Avoiding Pregnancy on Isotretinoin""&nbsp; Monthly while I'm on accutane I have to log on to the iPLEDGE website (you can google information about it... the FDA has a handy little page on it) and take a test on birth control monthly.&nbsp; As well as having blood drawn to get a pregnancy test.&nbsp; this drug was found in 1982 I believe, so we're coming up on it being around for about 30 years, and the only numbers that I could find were 2000 pregnancies (about 100 a year I think) and I think that the vast majority of them ended with miscarriages.&nbsp; I also wonder the numbers of pregnancies that were not reported because before 2007 there wasnt this extensive thing to go through.

And on top of that when I either drop off or pick up my prescription, I have to show them this little yellow card with an ID number so the tech or the pharmacist can check it in the computers to make sure I am able to take the medication.&nbsp; Like they dont have enough to do.&nbsp; And I only have a seven day window to drop off the scrip and pick it up.&nbsp; So like, Monday counts as day 1, and Saturday is day 7.&nbsp; After that, I think I have to wait until my next pregnancy test to get a new prescription.

Ok, so I'm back onto pregnancy tests.&nbsp; The first month that I'm on the meds, I have to go see the doctor for ""counseling"" and get a pregnancy test after that, up to seven days and have a pregnancy test within the first five days of my period.&nbsp; Which I dont understand.&nbsp; If I'm getting my period, wouldn't that indicate that I'm not pregnant?&nbsp; This means that I need to figure out when my next period is, which I think happens before my nex appointment.&nbsp; so maybe if I'm lucky, I've counted wrong and I'll get my period later than I expect (haha... last time I think I'll probably ever say that!)"

"event","Sooo... because I feel like such a good kid, I'll post again.&nbsp; simply because I 1. desperately want to avoid reading my 30 page complex paper for my psychology seminar and 2. because I need to share this with someone.

Soo.. I went for a run today (second time in a row!).&nbsp; So like yesterday, I started off with 5 laps (I think I could have gone for 6, but I stopped at 5) then I walked a lap, then ran 4 more (I got a cramp again)&nbsp; I think I'm not breathing right... I know Im not breathing right.&nbsp; I dont want to huff and puff as I run by people, so I dont breathe when I run by people (crazy and shallow, I know) so I walked a lap to relax, then&nbsp;I felt better and ran two more laps.&nbsp; Add all the running together and I ran a MILE!!!&nbsp; Honestly, I haven't run, like actually propelled myself around anything, a mile in such a long time.&nbsp; I feel like such a rock star.&nbsp; Hopefully if I keep this up, when I get home this weekend I'll see some results on the scale.&nbsp; I'm getting the exercise part down ok, I just need to stick to it.&nbsp; the food part on the other hand, eh.&nbsp; I've been really good about keeping a food diary.&nbsp; I dont remember if I posted about this before or not, so I will again.&nbsp; But I found these sheets on the net and saved them to word and stuck them in a cheap three ring binder and have been keeping track of what I eat.&nbsp; I've found that I eat wwwaaaayyyy too much pizza (my weakness) and not enough veggie stuff.&nbsp; Breakfast also isn't such a good thing for me, as in I dont eat b-fast on a regular basis.&nbsp; Wednesdays and Fridays I make time fore breakfast because of my 8am class (also to get some free coffee, which I need to get a bigger thermos) and that is never pretty.&nbsp; I almost always run right past the bagels, ceareal, fruit and yogurt for tater tots (aka ""home fries"" but they're tater tots) and omlettes.&nbsp; Omlettes are not so bad.&nbsp; but the tots are so bad for me.&nbsp; I need to make a conscious effort to have fruit and yogurt for b-fast, and an egg white omlette, and to stay away from the potatoes!&nbsp; But yeah, recently I've been good about getting a salad or having a turkey wrap or the vegetarian wrap and a soup cup, which is actually one cup, so its enough but still low on the calorie count.

I just hope I can keep the exercise part up into the summer when I'm working... which means I'll be back at the lovely mountain view grand.&nbsp; I just need to keep reminding myself that its good money and that I really only have this summer and possibly the next summer to be working there... then I will be an adult and out in the real world using my degree to teach instead of feeding fat, rich, snobby people food and slaving away for events that I dont even get a cut from (I hate!! that)... but its only three months and its good money.&nbsp; Its good money.&nbsp; Its good money."

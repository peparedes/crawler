<u><b>Fandom</b></u>: Iron Man 1, 2 & 3. Plus Avengers and some trailer footage from Age of Ultron.
<u><b>Audio</b></u>: ""One Vision"" by Queen (Mister A's 99% Fat Free Edit)

<u>Description</u>:

This is the Tony Stark/Iron Man vid of my heart. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff's Third. My Pieta. My Opus.

I originally pitched this song to Deejay when I was doing Sweet Charity back in 2008/9? But she turned it down as she wasn't fussed with Queen. But I'm glad now she did as I would have only had the first movie to work with and we got ""Let it Rock"" instead. For my mind this is the superior vid in every aspect...its exceeded even my expectations.

I started editing back in June 2014 but this vid almost was set back permanently when the lap top I was editing on died somewhat as the power input was not accepting charge. I gave it to a guy to fix and then never heard from him. Worried I'd lost my property I called the cops and they were able to track it down and my edit was still intact. Phew...crisis averted!

There's a few easter eggs scattered around in the edit. They are mostly at the start. See if you can pick them.

Hope you enjoy! Turn your speakers up to 11 first though...only way to listen to Queen is LOUD."

"event","Just wondering when dates are decided for Vividcon? And do they take into consideration of any other big events or cons that are on nationwide that might draw participants away?

Only reason I ask is I was also hoping to attend Gencon in Indy as well if I come over and it would really really really suck if both events are on the same weekend. I believe Gencon is set for 14-17th of August 2014 already. I don't think these 2 events clashed last year but was VVC on that exact weekend last year?"

Got the FRINGE polish, a Bladerunner feel & is hilarious in sections. Also Karl Urban as the star.

So much good TV at the moment (SHIELD, Sleepy Hollow, Blacklist, Walking Dead) but apart from Thrones, this is the cream of the crop.

Also I got to meet Lena Hedley recently at a Geek Festival ( <url>http://www.supanova.com.au/</url> )as she filled in for Peter Dinklage who was supposed to be here but pulled out due to scheduling commitments. Got her to sign a picture of Cercei, Jamie & Tyrion and managed to have a really good chat to her for like 6-7 minutes. Was so good!"

"event","<i>First happy new year to everyone! Hope everyone is well in LJ land</i> :)

Ive been a little bit distracted with my new job (one year anniversary last week) & a certain little known football team from New York lately. While I haven't had the urge to vid anything substantial for about a year, I do have my dream IM video on a timeline on my PC which I have been picking at every now and then. I will eventually finish it & god willing it will be this year...maybe just before or shortly after the Avengers comes out would be 2 good timeframes if you're the betting kind.

But thats not the reason behind this post.

Something Ive been meaning to do since my non-involvement with Vividcon these past few years is to <u>offer audio edits to those who need it for their vids</u>.

So the <b>first 6 people</b> who need a virtually flawless cutdown/edit of a song they need for their VVC vid gets it. I'll be doing it with Cool Edit Pro (which is essentially Adobe Audition), which I used on Nickys Fountain vid whereby I cut out an entire section of the song in the middle.

One song per customer.

First in best dressed. 

Must be for Vividcon.

<i>(though if I really like the sound of your song/idea I will offer to do it for you if you didn't make it into the first six)</i>


Takers so far: Deejay, Kiki, Anoel."

"event","While I really enjoyed the story of TRON: Legacy (won't spoil it), the lead Garrett Hedlund is flat early & often. One of his worst readings is his first with Bruce Boxleitner, and although things do improve after that scene, its not a drastic improvement. Luckily the rest of the cast is more than capable & it almost seems they are compensating for Hedlund - the stand outs Michael Sheen, Olivia Wilde & of course Jeff Bridges. The other disappointment is Clu's face. Its clearly a good approximation of a young Jeff Bridges, but that's as far as it gets. The real footage of Bridges used in montages at the beginning only serve to highlight these flaws - and its mainly around the eyes that really sticks out. Its just not on the money, especially to those who remember Jeff when he was young. Theres a few fleeting moments when it does actually look him but they are few and far between. Which is majorly disappointing considering that the team that delivered Benjamin Button were responsible for this.

The action sequences are superb as are the FX, seeing the programs splinter into a thousand fragments never got old - which is good because it happens often. There are lots of little throwbacks to the original and I was genuinely enjoying picking every one of them. Don't bother staying through the credits, no extras to see - which I thought there might have been given a certain turn of events towards the climax. Also the score is one of the highlights, but that was pretty clear before the film had even rolled with Daft Punk at the helm.

This was one of the three movies of 2010 that were the most anticipated for me (Inception, Iron Man 2 were the other 2) and it was those 2 major flaws that easily made it the weakest of the 3. With a much stronger lead this could have been one of the best of the year. As it stands, this film never really gets into top gear. Still worth it to catch it in cinemas on cheap ass Tuesday, or for cheaper than standard rates.

I really like how you can see easily what the top 3 age groups are that are watching your videos, and what countries the majority of the hits are coming from. Also when they were first embeded somewhere else & when they were first viewed on a mobile device in the graph area is also kinda nifty.

On the insight page you can select a certain date range to see how many hits occurred within that period and which vids represent the most popular or the ones that get the most attention (not always the same vids as you can see by my graphs). And its all sortable depending on what you wanna look at.

I am suitably impressed YT. Now if you only allowed the same video file to be re-uploaded over the old one to take advantage of the better streaming quality or to fix fucked up aspect ratios (like what you did to my Tombstone vid) the same way Stage 6 used to, I'd be happier than Happy Hogan. 

And he's pretty fucking happy."

Obvious song choice is obvious. Crappy poster/banner is crappy.

Soooo, Hellboy. I wanted to love your movies. I really did. But as it was they just didn't really grab me. They were good for a laugh but not something I wanted to own and watch every so often.

So I set myself a challenge, to try an make something out of the movies that I would watch over and over. <i>Gives You Hell</i> always was in my mind as the perfect song for H.B. since it came out and because I couldn't cut what I wanted to in time for BASCon 2010 without really rushing it, I did this instead.

I really wanted to lip sync the group singing bit, but ran out of time & viable footage so thats how the comic panel section was born.

Hope it raised a smile or 2 on the day."

"event","Hello <strike>LLCOOLJAY</strike> LJ peoples. I just posted a comment that wasn't just what I enjoyed but where I felt things could have been improved on a persons vid, and I for the first time in a long while I felt completely liberated. Because I felt those constructive criticisms had the potential to <em>help</em> the person involved.<br /><br />So from this day forward I will continue to post comments that feature only the positive aspects I see in your video....BUT....if you are genuinely &amp; honestly open to wanting constructive criticism on your vids, other options you may not have considered or just ways to improve for next time around, please let me know by saying so in this post. By doing this you are aware that I am by no means the BE&nbsp;ALL&nbsp;&amp; END&nbsp;ALL&nbsp;of an authority on vids - I'm just one person among millions with an opinion. And as far as personal opinions go, <em>mine are no more valid than the next persons</em>. <br /><br />Ive never personally been comfortable with that anonymous comment thing that goes around every so often because it just seems like you're hiding your identity to get out your true feelings on vid to avoid potentially risking a friendship. No disrespect to anyone whos used it OR&nbsp;to the instigators of the idea - if it works for you then keep doing it! <br /><br />There's a quite a few people out there whos work I enjoy, but that doesn't mean I feel the need to comment on every vid they do because they all don't speak to me as much as other vids in their catalogue. My mantra on this matter has always been if you can't say something positive, then don't say anything at all. There's just too much snarky/petty one-up-manship on the internet already to even risk going through all that bullshit let alone unravel a friendship.<br /><br />This is also applicable to me in case you think it might be a one way street. My background does not automatically make me Mister Perfect by design. I would actually be a little worried if everyone &amp; anyone who saw my work agreed, understood &amp; loved them un-conditionally. <br /><br /><strong>So consider this a blanket announcement that you don't have to only tell me about the things you enjoyed in my vids.</strong> If you take the time to constructively criticise my work when it doesn't  quite do it for you on some level <em>then I've got all the time in the  world for you</em>. But deliberately troll me - and you'll be talking to  the hand."

This vid came about quickly as a test bed for using/formatting 1080p source as well as Media Composer 5. But it rapidly mutated into something truly frightening. Its the Hammer in Hi-Def. And I gotta say I'm pretty fucking happy with the end results, especially the file size/quality ratio.

Hopefully the song choice will be something you didn't expect and then you'll be pleasantly surprised at how the whole thing unfolds.

If I was truly talented I would have made the Hammer Drones his backup dancers - you'll know which scene I'm talking about when it happens. Might be something for the 10,800p re-master...."

<a href=""http://kristin1228.livejournal.com/21568.html"">Crazier (C.Bale Ensemble vid)</a> by <lj user=""kristin1228"">

Kristin is a very talented young lady and actually was the one who directed me to Livejournal in the first place. This vid combines the original Gary Numan music video with an ensemble of  characters played in films by Christian Bale. Great song & even better editing and a wicked theme to match.


<a href=""http://humansrsuperior.livejournal.com/88060.html"">Butterflies & Hurricanes (Iron Man)</a> by <lj user=""humansrsuperior"">

Simply one of the best Iron Man vids anywhere, HRS deftly retells Tony Starks lifechanging experience, redemption & will to ""be the best"". Audio grabs from the film at the end to round off an awesome tribute to my favorite Super Hero of all time, all set to the audio stylings of supergroup Muse.


<a href=""http://obsessive24.livejournal.com/208627.html"">The Fountain (Film)</a> by <lj user=""obsessive24"">

You could throw a dart into Nicky's entire vid catalog and hit something that will knock your socks off - <i>Jesus for the Jugular, Cells, OMG!, Change In The House of Flies</i>....the list goes on. But its this video of hers that I love the most, an concept that I couldn't shake yet couldn't make - & when she took it on board it turned out way better than even I had envisaged, she has completely captured the emotion of the mashup with her vision here. I remember reading later that this is among her least favorite vids, but I will forever remain its number one fan, waving a giant foam hand at its greatness.


<a href=""http://bradcpu.livejournal.com/28864.html"">Vertigo (House MD)</a> by <lj user=""bradcpu"">

Here's another one of those people who have an impressive stable of vids, Brad - like fine wine - just seems to get better as he gets older. But its the lovely little 2007 vintage I keep coming back too. An excellent blend of trippy imagery & phat beats from the show that pours ever so smoothly from the bottle thats satisfing to the last drop. Waiter! Another bottle for my friends here....


<a href=""http://bananainpyjamas.livejournal.com/99978.html"">Intergalactic Friends (Smallville)</a> by <lj user=""bananainpyjamas""> aka DC.

Pure entertainment value from a vidder who has impressed me from day one. It was a line ball between this and <i>Break Teen Spirit in 4 Minutes</i>, but in the end I had to give it to this vid just for its energy, pacing & overall fun. This is DC on top of her game, though that's usually a position she rarely leaves with any of her vids. I would say that everyone should this out, but I think <u>everyone</u> already has!


<a href=""http://jarrow.livejournal.com/956803.html"">Falling From The Sky (BSG)</a> by <lj user=""jarrow"">

This vid oozes awesome sauce from every nook an cranny, that how packed full of awesomeness it is. A perfect blend of storytelling & beat editing in the one neat package. This is a vid that if it were a character in the BSG universe, it would first drink Starbuck under the table then go out an destroy the entire Cylon race BY ITSELF. Sublime.


<a href=""http://sockkpuppett.livejournal.com/292325.html"">Estatic Drum Trip (Farscape)</a> by <lj user=""sockkpuppett""> aka Luminosity

Who needs acid when you mix Farscape and Rusted Root? Wicked, wicked editing mixed with the ""Time"" conversation between Crichton & ""Einstein"" makes for a highly entertaining ride. This vid has made me get out the DVD's on many occasions for a look back at one of my favorite Sci-Fi series of all time.


<a href=""http://balistik94.livejournal.com/5566.html"">Even Dogs Dream (A Bittersweet Life)</a> by <lj user=""balistik94"">

Where do I begin with this one.
Excellent editing? Check. 
Crystal clear story telling? Check. 
Powerful emotion resonance? Check.

Using a song/video combination to express personal experience just works magic over this viewer and is one that I found I could also relate to. This is a video that just shouldn't be missed by anyone.


<a href=""http://hitmanyr2k.com/Creativity8.htm"">Decent (The Crow)</a> by <lj user=""aj2k"">

The Crow is one of my all time favorite movies and I own the graphic novel as well. AJ has blended the 2 together in an absolutely breathtaking manner set to the Foo Fighters ""Let It Die"". He's made a lot of Crow vids over the years but this is without a doubt the cream of the crop & its no surprise that it made NYMags best vids of 2008. No other Crow vid comes close to this one and its another one of those vids that makes me break out the DVD whenever I watch it.


<a href=""http://charmax.livejournal.com/26159.html"">No Bravery (Troy)</a> by <lj user=""charmax"">

Last but certainly not least is Charmax's opus for Troy. James Blunt & Ancient Greece is a combination that doesn't instantly spring to mind, but when you watch this video you'll realize that its like the 2 were made for each other. Charmax captures the emotion of the song perfectly through the retelling of the film through her editing & shot choices and really presents a great theme - there are no heroes in war.

</lj-cut>

There are lots of great vids out there by many talented people that I enjoy, but these are the ones I would take with me to a desert island. So please don't feel left out if you're not on the list.

Feel free to re-use my graphic if you wanna make your own list & try to do it on the 10th of the 10th in '10!"

"event","Ive been slack round these here parts. And I have major post VVC catch-up to do in addition to a small backlog of vids that is seriously eating into my desktop space. 

The reason is I have been editing. Not for love, but for money...back to freelancing. I did have a full time job working on Graphical Data Entry for one of the major Telcos in the city which was great (and it kinda tapped into my Photoshop skills with a technical layer mixed in), but they put on too many people, so all the newbies were let go. :/

Good news is that there is plenty of editing work at a place I usually go at the moment & the first job was even kinda Vid-dery. I had to cut 5 days worth of Highlights packages for the <a href=""http://www.mbff.com.au/mbfftv/"">Mercedes Benz Fashion Festival</a> & then an overall Highlights package, in which I just really taped a bunch of previous sequences together. Don't bother watching the first day - I had like 90 mins to cut it and have it uploaded so its as rough as guts - the rest I had about 3-4 hours each. Day 5 (great mashup track) & the ""The Week that Was"" are the only 2 worth watching.

Also been cutting color stories & some 1 minute webisodes for an Outback Resort at Uluru, so it has kick started my mojo again somewhat. Which is good news seeing as I kinda promised Brad a vid for Bascon this year. Although I wont be able to give him the one previously discussed as Ive not touched it since we talked & I want it to look good & not rush it. Got something else in mind though...

<lj-cut text=""By Xenas Breasts, that Spartacus is a rollicking good show!"">
On the fandom front I've loved the Spartacus:Blood and Sand 13 part series that aired on Starz earlier this year which was just epic with its blood, boobs and blades. Came for the action/gore stayed for the awesome plot twists and turns. Could be a vid in the works if I ever get around to it.

I also loved Inception which was just gob-smackingly awesome in every aspect - I definately need to see it again. Best film of the Year & its truly Nolans opus of filmaking and most definitely vid worthy. Can wait to wrap a timeline around some of that footage.

Also played through Red Dead Redemption which was fantastic although the very last bit of revenge could have been better scripted in a ""romantic"" (not literally) sense. Looking forward to heap of games coming soon, mainly Force Unleashed 2 & Dues Ex: Human Revolution. They look to be right up my alley.

Well thats enough gasbagging, better get cracking on some feedback!"

Shouldn't be a surprise that I loved it, and probably as much as the first.

I will admit that the first's story is a lot tighter while the second has a lot more going on with its larger cast of characters - I wouldn't say the pacing drags, there's just a lot more to absorb in a short frame of time & I can see how the bigger ensemble & their arcs could be made accountable for this. It also doesn't have the political relevance the first film had. I didn't seem to get affected by that though, I was totally engaged the whole way through.

Downey again nails Stark to a T, and while he makes a return to his ego-tistical, prick-ish ways he still manages to keep us on his side. Rockwell's Hammer is in fine form, and does an excellent job of portraying used-car-salesman-turned-weapons-dealer (loved his little Hammer dance at the expo). Scenes with Downey & Rockwell in the first act are worth the price of admission alone. I was pleased to see Faverau give himself increased screen time as Happy - he had some great comedic moments. Scar-Jo is serviceable as Black Widow as was Sam as Fury, but I just didn't feel Gwens turn as Pepper (or the romance between her & Stark) this time round & apart from Vankos/Rourkes initial appearance, he never really came across as the uber villain of the piece, which were probably the weakest elements of the film for me.

I'm pleased ILM have really been let off the leash here, because the action sequences are excellent and way more impressive than the original. Whiplash's debut, Tony's Birthday party & the final battle being the standout sequences. 

And for the all Marvel fans, <u>yeah stay until after the credits</u> - there's some gold to be had.

This sort of film is the reason I go to the cinema, to be thoroughly entertained & to have a decent laugh.

<b>4.5 stars out of 5</b>

I gave it an extra 1/2 star because of how well War Machine was realized - that being my comic book dream come true. Also neglected to mention that Cheadles' turn as Rhodey made me go ""Terrance Who?"". He was really that much stronger in the role compared to the first."

If you couldn't already tell from that I had quite a hard on for Star Wars, kind of like the one I have for The Matrix & Iron Man. I cut the whole thing too.

This and <a href=""http://www.motionbox.com/videos/3096dbb81a19e5c4be"">the year before</a> were probably my first forays into making music vids and using copyrighted materials for skits. All before the age of non-linear too. Ahhh the good old days of A/B rolls & tape to tape.

My favorite goof I cut out of everything was the trailer using the news readers hissy fits - the one with the Beegees music underneath in that second link.

Also vid catch up will have to wait until May 1 - Olivia Dunham, Greg House & the 11th Doctor all have dibs on my last gig of bandwidth for this month. Then when the 5th months ticks over I can go crazy on the backlog. Theres definately a few I wanna check out that look hawt."

<lj-cut text=""Thinky thoughts on the future of streaming sites"">
Wasn't surprised in the slightest that the site adopted a new business model ala imeem, nor will I be when then next generation of like-minded streaming sites do the same. Or the generation after that. Or the ones after that.

I'm just pleased that I didn't bother with uploading anything there.

Ive said it before - while we continue to dip our toes into public streaming sites, there will always be risk to losing vids or even your whole account. And like a certain Agents favorite saying, says its inevitable. You'll probably save yourself some grief if you just adopt that mindset whilst enjoying the honeymoon period with the next contender. Because before you know it it will go down quicker than a 2 dollar whore.

For example here's another service that's very similar to Vimeo with excellent streaming video quality (audios a bit on the low side though): Motionbox

<lj-embed id=""61""/>

But you only get 750 meg total & 100 embeded plays per video & 500 total embed plays per month on top of the usual copyright verbatim. So...same shit, different smell.

Ive been using 4shared for a while to host my D/L'able vids now & its pretty good in that regard.

<lj-embed id=""62""/> 

I just wish that it would stream in the correct A.R. instead of displaying everything in 4:3. I've tried stuffing around and changing width code but that just makes it worse. It would have been a nice one stop shop...like Stage 6 was.

<u>Description</u>:

Got listening to this song a couple of years ago & instantly pictured it as a vehicle for a TRON vid both lyrically & muscially - it just seemed like the perfect fit. And its been in the back of my mind & on my to-vid list ever since. So when I picked up the 25th anniversary edition cheap on DVD, it was suddenly the right time. 

But at the same time I wanted to make a updated trailer as well for the movie as no one has really done it justice that I'd seen anywhere. But as that would have taken some effort as well, I decided to just combine the 2 ideas. The opening scene is exactly how I would have started my TRON trailer (minus the text/credit info) - also a SFX from the District 9 trailer was thrown in for added effect.

Ive also decided to do away with watermarks, so thats why its not there. I didn't think to keep the position consistent anyway in my other vids, so maybe its a good thing."

For the past 18 months the rental we live next too, theres like 5-6 guys living in the house that are scab labourers hired from overseas. That fact in itself is annoying enough as the enconomy has been tough for local aussie workers, but it isn't the thing that <i>really</i> shits me to tears. The worst part has been that at least every second weekend - their carport which is 2 meters from our loungeroom (ie: my sanctuary for watching movies & TV) - they use as party central & play their music & TV outside & laugh like fucking hyenas late into the night. We know the owners & they asked us to call them if there was anything wrong, but I guess they only meant if their house was burning down or some shit like that as they've done pretty much nothing to help this situation. And when the local sluts & drug dealers from up the road have joined in making the parties last longer, I'd finally had enough.

I'd actually been planning it for some weeks & when we returned from Fiji I put my plan into action. I went out & bought <b>the smelliest bag of chicken-poo pellet fertiliser and laid it on the grass right next to their carport</b>. And the best part was I only laid it only in front of our aircon split system exhaust, so that the smell blows <u>directly</u> into that area & doesn't affect us. I seemed like a good plan. I didn't realize how well it would work though.

When my wife woke early the next morning at 5am, one of them must had gone outside for a early morning smoke. The next thing she heard was hime outside hosing & scrubbing everything in sight in the immediate area. By 7am they were ALL up doing it! It pretty much contiued on like that until 10am when they gave up & decided to get out of the house for a bit. We literally were ROFL'ing. And there wasn't so much as a peep out of next door for the whole weekend. Hopefully that will continue - I'll just remember to ""top up"" every Thurs/Fri.

They say revenge is sweet. In my world, it just fucking stinks.

<u>Description</u>:  

I decided to give my 2005 Matrix vid a make-over before I do a system reformat while I still had all the footage on my PC. Ive also fixed a few of the things that bugged me about it, and replaced some shots to improve the overall structure & ""angry"" theme.

<lj-cut text=""Background history &amp; notes"">
The Burly Man is the only vid I've ever created out of therapy, which I mentioned in my <a href=""http://mranderson71.livejournal.com/19219.html"">previous post</a>. I think I originally cut it in about a week, and while I could have spent longer tweaking it...the best part about therapy is the release & letting go. To have kept working on it would have only kept me angry for longer. So its kind of ironic that now while I'm feeling the most <i>zen</i> in my life I've gone back to remaster & tweak it into the vid it was meant to be. You can still find the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNDtnV0Oi-E"">original vid here</a>.

Its a lot tighter & more <b>intense</b> now, with 20% more Neo angry face!. There's more shorter cuts/shot changes. Some sections are unchanged, especially the very beginning of the vid but for the most its quite a bit more intense. Gone also are sequences that, in retrospect, didn't keep that intensity up - such as the fight with good guy Seraph (from the Teahouse fight, where he ""quits & lets the shit slip""). I decided to keep it strictly to characters that were enemies engaging Neo.

Also during the section of the song where it repeats <i>""...and if my day keeps going this way I just might...""</i> the original had the middle one of those three repeticious lines with Neo striking back at the guy with the sword, whereas now he's being smacked around in all three. So by the time he gets to the last one, he's <u>really</u> pissed off & retaliates by breaking all sorts of shit - peoples faces, light posts, statues, etc.

I also recycled an effect I used on Matrix Life to lead into the ""he said, she said"" sections to highlight their arrival a bit more. And I think this may be the only vid I've made that doesn't have jump cuts! Still not sure how I restained myself the second time around...

This kid is absolutely adorable, if I couldn't adopt him then I hope my child grows up with that same kind of enthusiastic innocence!


The second video is a short excerpt from one of the extra discs from the 10 disc box set of the Ultimate Matrix collection & one of my personal favourites. It deals with shooting some of the TV monitor Neo's in the Architect scene from Reloaded.

<lj-embed id=""31""/>

<b>The Burly Man</b> is the only vid I've made out of therapy, and this short clip vividly illustrates what I was feeling internally when I made the original video back in 2005. I don't ever get enraged but I really was <i>that</i> angry and it really takes an extreme situation to get me to that level. I'd also planned to remix some of Neo's outbursts into the intro of the Burly Man remaster in a conversation with the Architect. But the effort required to recomposite the footage and make it look seamless with the original movie required far more effort than it was worth. So I'll just share it with you in all its glory :) For all the shit they've copped - my love for the Wachowskis is unfaltering & I would have given my left nut to be on-set this one day...

Hope to have the remaster up in a day or 2."

The only thing bad thats happened is my video card died a sad death a week ago & I need a new replacement. I was going to do a big reformat during my holidays anyway so I'll just have to shout myself a new one as well as a new 250/320 gig HDD for the PS3. This could also be good news vidding wise as it forces me to complete my <i>TRON</i> vid and the <i>Burly Man remaster</i> I had been planning. Also got a really cool trailer idea for <i>Merlin</i> (that Ive had since season one) I am super keen to turn into reality which will come after the reformat.

Also I have seen probably the best comedy Australia has ever produced in <b>:30 Seconds</b>

Having worked in the advertising industry (and essentially still working in it), this just makes my heart explode with over exposure to awesome. Its funny in a blatantly & surprisingly honest way & quite similar to 30 Rock - I feel anyone of any nationality would enjoy this series. The way the main guy see an advert in any everyday products is kind a similar to how a vid idea formulates in my head! If you can spare a 200meg-ish download it is most definately worth your time & effort checking out the first episode. It also has some very strong female characters & the second episode is worth a look as well for some brilliant insight into the female mind which I know would probably have most of my flist fist-pumping the air.

These promos don't fully do the show justice, though there are a few grabs from the show in each one.

"event","Had a blast at Gencon Oz this year! Its the best con Ive ever been to based entirely on my own experiences, of which I will elaborate further when I can actually look at a screen for more than 15 minutes. I got to interact with Sam Witwer & Kate Vernon, of which I have video of...but again this will come when health & time returns.

2 days sick leave would of have been a great time to catch up on feedback too, but again the 15 minute thing was prohibitive.


In the interim I found these 2 videos (not by me) that a nice little montages of various aspects just so you get an idea of what it was like:

I don't think are many individuals that ever make them to be intentionally controversial or confronting. Unfortunately, there's always the risk of someone who will take offense to some aspect of your work. And those individuals will always be looking for such issues, whether they exist or not.

To sum up, its not you...<i>its them</i>.

So always take heart in that fact, and never ever let it stop you making & sharing your creations.

Haven't had a chance to get through the rest of VVC vids as yet. Am on the case, though.

"event","I mean apart from the BAM-SPAM-DRAM(A)? And the fact that Nicky has probably released about 7 vids in that time?

Seriously behind on my LJ reading, something I hope to catch up on tonight with the missus on the other side of the continent for work.

In my own little world things have been busy, it seems my bitching to the universe about my job situation has worked...kind of. While I haven't found an alternative, I did get something very close to a <i>10% payrise</i>. We get a pay review every year but I wasn't expecting such a jump. Go me! I have gone from wage to salary though now & I don't get leave loading for holidays or paid for overtime - but I didn't do that much OT to begin with).

With Comic Con come and gone & no bootleg <b>Iron Man 2</b> footage to be seen Mister A was a very sad boy :( But luckily, a very cool thing happened.

<a href=""http://www.flynnlives.com/media/video/0xendgame.aspx"">They released a hi-res version of the FX test from last years TRON:Legacy</a>, which has re-charged the vidding batteries back up just above critical levels...enough for me to lay some old skool TRON footage down on a timeline. And it'll be even getting back to my action roots...although the mainly static shots will be somewhat of a hurdle to turn into something decent.

Also finished remastering Handlebars for <lj user=""deejay""> which along with a DVD of Let It Rock will be winging its way to her hopefully in time before she leaves for Vividcon. Heres the DVD case & discs:

And no deej, the Iron Man stress ball is not part of the package!

I also recently did a face-to-face vidder interview with the lovely Katie Freund, aka <lj user=""nushanakt""> to help with her with her research - which was fun. Even though it was an interview type situation, the best thing was to be able to talk to someone ""in real time"" about vids. As opposed to all this written dialogue. Now I know why everyone goes so batshit-ballistic for VVC...I mean apart from the flood of new vids that also accompanies this time of year.

A reason I have been rather absent also is both promoting & gearing up for a <a href=""http://www.genconoz.com/"">big convention of my own</a>, although instead of watching/talking/living/breathing vids, I'll be blowing shit up with <a href=""http://www.classicbattletech.com/index.php?action=gallery"">big, stompy robots</a>. If you squint really hard, or watch a Transformers vid its <i>kind of</i> the same thing...

In final news, finished watching Merlin & discovered a fucking hilarious show featuring my current ""man crush"" Danny McBride - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUiOP3-m2oM"">Eastbound & Down</a>. So politically incorrect its not funny. Well, actually it is. I love it anyway."

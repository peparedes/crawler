"event","My Angel Up Above


My angel up above
In the clouds she is looking down
Shining bright with beauty and love

Her beauty so radiant 
Her love so divine
And to think
I used to call her mine

Now with this gun to my head
I fight to pull the trigger
Wanting to join her on that cloud
But not wanting to leave this earth

Pressing hard into my skull
Boring a hole to my brain
The barrel feels so cold
Tears pouring out of my eyes
This pain is getting old

Her beauty so radiant 
Her love so divine
And to think
I used to call her mine

I just want to be 
With my angel up above



ok so this one is a little bit morbid, but its not talking about suicide. yes i know that is the theme of the song , but the underlying theme is that this dude would do anything to get to this girl, to make her notice him, even something as radical as killing himself. not to worry though, its just a song, not an omen that i am gonna do anything. let me know what you think.

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#006600>first off, after going to Kings Dominion i was dead tired and having to go to work at 9 in the morning is not a good thing. so needless to say i woke up late. so i quickly jumped in the shower and ate breakfast. now for some odd reason i just knew today was going to bad. one because i was so tired, and two because i woke up thinking about allison. not good at all!! so i spent most of the day thinking about her and angry at myself cause i was thinking about her. now secondly, the group that came in was horrible. the head teacher was a nasty mean tempered woman who was so mean to the kids and kept telling amy that she was being hateful to her. now the lady had none of her stuff together and she had no idea what was going on. we assigned groups on the bus and when the kids went inside the lady changed the groups around so we had no idea what was going on. and dont even get me started on the kids!!!!!! they tore everything to pieces. so much stuff was broken its not even funny. finally the group left and it was so quiet. thirdly, emily's camp kids were a mess and loud as mess. so i had to help her a little bit with that. needless to say i am drained out. i finally got to leave work and headed off to bible study. i really needed me some Jesus after the day that i had. after bible study i hit the gym to get out some aggression. i ran on the treadmill for a long time while listening to MCR (My Chemical Romance). Rock on MCR!!! pumped some iron too. i really lost alot since the last time i lifted which was like 6 months ago. so i really need to get back into it. which ill get back to my normal weight after a week or so. so im really exhausted now and sore and tired and everything that goes along with that so im off to bed leave me some nice ones.</FONT></STRONG></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#006600>ok so its tuesday and i already want the weekend to be here. i dont know why. i mean i have to work saturday, so i dont know whats up. i guess it might be because anna is coming back from camp in&nbsp;SC for the weekend and we are hopefully&nbsp;gonna hang out. she is one cool chick. i think im starting to like her a little bit too. i mean she is great. everything that she has been through in her life has given her&nbsp;such a strong personality. everything has a good side to it, with her there is never a bad side. whats even better is that she is such a strong christian and thats one thing i look for first in a person. plus she is really cute and thats always a good thing. i really want to hang with her this weekend. so hopefully that will happen. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#006600>well i have a long day tomorrow and i need my sleep. night night kids</FONT></P>"

"event","ok so i didnt post yesterday because my day was very busy and i didnt get home till like 3 in the morning, which i'll explain later. for right now let me start at the begining of the day.

so i wake up and im feeling good because of the night before at chick-fil-a. so i go off to work and im doing really good. after work i had to go to church to help set up sound and props for a play that the little kiddies were putting on. i was fine until i look back at the back doors of the gymshuary (the sanctuary has been moved into the gym while they are renovating it)and there walking in is my ex girlfriend allison. right then my stomach lurched and my heart dropped. not because i cant stand her, but because im still deeply in love with her and she doesnt want to have anything to do with me. its horrible. i know she still loves me too and she wants to be together, but for some reason she cant be with me. i dont know why because she never talked to me when we were dating. for some reason she could never express her feelings. she cannot communicate what-so-ever. and that always killed me. anyway, so she walked in and i all of the sudden became nauseous. so i put on that happy face so that no one can see how bad i feel and go about my work and kinda watch her out of the corner of my eye. she looks just about as bad as i feel. i wanted to talk to her so bad, but i knew if i did i would say something stupid or just dig my hole deeper because i keep trying to fix things and i mean them all for good, but everything i try to fix just gets screwed up more and im getting tired of it. so im trying to move on and thats why i gave the girl at chick-fil-a my number. apparently its not working though because i still think of allison all the time and it hurts so bad that all i want to do is curl up in a ball in my bed and cry for the rest of my pitiful life. its very sad. i wanted to talk to her the whole night though and i was glad when the whole thing was over so i could get out of there. after church i went over to my youth leaders house to meet him so we could go to the midnight showing of star wars!!!! thats why i didnt get home till 3 in the morning. the movie was awesome by the way. so i went home to bed and luckily i didnt have to work today so i got to sleep in. 

today i pretty much did nothing. it was great!!! i watched tv all morning, which i never get to do. this afternoon i went hung with abbott at his house for a while. after that i came home and watched more tv. tons of fun.

so the past two days have been pretty eventful. now i am going to go to bed so i will be able to get up for work tomorrow. night kiddies!! ;)"

"event","<P><FONT color=#33ff33>ok so i went to chick-fil-a after bible study with my good buddies abbott and joseph and we tormented the staff there. i went through the drive-thru to get a refill for my drink and walked back in the resturant and everyone was like what??? the reason i went through the drive-thru was because this hot girl was working there and i wanted to hit on her. i kept trying to get her number, but she wouldnt give it to me. so i finally got one of those comment cards and was like ""so i want to let 'chick-fil-a' know what i think about the service here"" and i filled out the card and gave it to her and was like ""so do you think 'headquarters' will give me a call about my comments"". she was like ""you probably wont get a call, but you might get an email"". it sounds really childish, but it was great fun.&nbsp;it was GREAT!!!!! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33>well kiddos it is time for me to retire for the night because i am tired and there is much needed rest to be had.&nbsp;so until tomorrow i bid you ado.</FONT></P>

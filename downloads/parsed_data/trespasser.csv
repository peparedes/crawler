They cut my work schedule in half, so I have to find another job. I'm thinking i'm gonna apply to be a server at Pizza Hut. Maybe I'll make some good tips or something.

It's nice to know that my life is always going to be strung along from paycheck to paycheck barely hanging on by a thread, always wondering if I'm gonna get my hours cut. It's ok though I can always sell things to make rent and buy groceries and beg off of other people.

SOMETIMES i feel like such a waste of space, and I'm sure glad I have a livejournal to write about it in."

"event","<P>OK so this is gonna be my official outlet for <STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>SPOOKY TALES OF RETAIL</FONT><FONT color=#000000> Mmkay?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>I wasn't entirely sure I was gonna do this but since we opened our store, we *have* gotten a lot of really crazy people in here. Ranging from moderately spooky window washers all the way up to complete grade-A drooling maniacs.</P>
<P>Usually, it's just a kind of wierd person who walks in with a vacant stare and strange smell. Maybe about 50% zombie. But sometimes... Sometimes you get the *really* bizarre people.</P>
<P>For example, yesterday, a guy walked in with two paper plates taped together filled with some kind of unknown red substance and a FILTHY bottle of what, at least at one point, seemed to be Fresca.</P>
<P>He plopped it down in front of me on the counter. In this dialogue, the parentheticals are what I'm thinking.</P>
<P>HIM: Here, want some lunch?</P>
<P>ME: No thank you. (Who are you and why are you in my store trying to give me what is probably a ground up body part?)</P>
<P>HIM: Can I use your phone? I'll give you my Fresca.</P>
<P>ME: No, that's ok, go ahead and just use the phone. (Stop trying to pawn off your urine on me as fresca, creepy possibly mentally unstable homeless guy.)</P>
<P>HIM: *uses the phone* *leaves*</P>
<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</P>
<P>Ok so that was bizarre. Not quite as bizarre as the really creepy conversation I just had. This is it, VERBATIM. Once again, the parantheticals are what I was thinking.</P>
<P>The set: All Game. 28 W First Street, Duluth, MN...</P>
<P>The time: about 11 AM</P>
<P>The situation; I'm sitting there adding some things into inventory.</P>
<P>Suddenly,&nbsp;the door opens. I can't quite make out who comes in.... I hear him cough. He walks over to a steering wheel. He doesn't look *that* crazy. Kinda disheveled, but maybe a good person.</P>
<P>HIM: *looking at the steering wheel* So, do I have to be five to play this?</P>
<P>ME: What was that?</P>
<P>HIM: Do I have to be five?</P>
<P>ME: No... (was that drool I just saw?)</P>
<P>HIM: These games. What are they all about? I sometimes play with these little kids and they always beat me and I can't figure it out.</P>
<P>ME: (you play with five-year-olds??) Uh... I dunno, it's pretty surprising what they can do.</P>
<P>HIM: You know what real videogames are? Pong. You remember pong? I was playing pong and I got beat by five year olds! But inside I laugh because I know I can beat them. So do you get a lot of five and six year old kids in here?</P>
<P>ME: (WTF?!) Uhm.... ... ...no we mostly have college aged people actually...</P>
<P>HIM: but not in the military, right?</P>
<P>ME: .... (what the hell is wrong with this guy)&nbsp;... right? ... ...</P>
<P>HIM: and not the CIA or FBI or anything?</P>
<P>ME: I guess I don't really know... (o_O)</P>
<P>HIM: So it's like if they just wanna play basketball so they go home and play these games and than that's it... Than later they go out on dates. Ok.</P>
<P>Than he left. Just like that.</P>
<P>Now I don't know what was going on but this guy creeped me out more than most people usually do... That's saying a lot.</P>"

"event","<P>Once again, it's been a long time... Not as long as sometimes but... yeah.</P>
<P>I dunno, a lot is going on. First of all, good stuff;</P>
<P>King Kong, Chronicles of Narnia, Dark Water, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and King Kong are the four best movies to come out in the last year.</P>
<P>This year started out cool, I was still with Jake and very happy. He broke up with me and broke my heart... I thought I knew what that meant before, but I was wrong. It hurts a lot. I'm mostly better now, though. I worked through the summer to make it better. It started out with my doing everything I could to get him back. I quit at Gamestop, moved out, and started my own store. All of these things were originally an attempt to get him back, which now of course I realize is retarded.</P>
<P>Anyway, my summer was pretty much empty. I was totally not over him yet and it was really hard. I never really went out or did anything with anyone... It was almost entirely wasted.</P>
<P>I did go to the Summer Solstice festival this year, but at that time I was still barely even able to function, so it didn't go over so well for me.</P>
<P>I met Chris early on in the summer. What a weird situation. I'm not actually related to him but he's part of our family, and at the time, he had a girlfriend. He was here for his dad's funeral... Another really strange thing...</P>
<P>I almost immediately fell for him more or less... Obviously there was no way it would ever work though, right? So for the rest of the summer I just mostly worked. When school started, I continued working and made some new friends and lost touch with some old ones and continued to be friends with other old ones. :-\</P>
<P>In October we had halloween. I dressed like a gigantic banana because i was so thoroughly not into halloween that it wasn't even funny. The costume was a blast and i really *did* end up having fun, though. The pumpkins were cool. I also dated Topher for a while, which turned out disasterous, much to my dismay. I'm still really sorry for how that turned out, but there's not much I can do to fix it so I guess it's best to just not think about it.</P>
<P>In november Chris came up for thanksgiving and stayed at my house for like four days. It went rather well, but still seemed kinda hopeless. We didn't really do anything except talk a lot, and on thanksgiving he kissed me for the first time. At this point it was like... the whole year has been an emotional rollercoaster and, while I was incredibly happy that it was happening, I knew it was a bad thing because he had a girlfriend he had no intentions of leaving. I was frustrated and angry but also incredibly happy with diluding myself into thinking everything'd be ok.</P>
<P>My spending habits were shit all year, and continue to be shit. I lost my car to an accident and still have yet to be able to save up enough money to even begin to think about getting another one. Darren keeps trying to help by telling me to stop spending but it doesn't help at all because he's very abrasive about it and it comes off as him just trying to control me, which of course I will rebel against. I thank him for trying to help but sometimes the way he goes about doing it seems more destructive than if he'd just not say anything. Ugh.</P>
<P>Anyway, the night Chris went back to L.A. was really difficult, and there was a lot of crying and frantic kissing and stuff... About a week after he got home he called me... He'd broken up with his girlfriend. It wasn't my fault though, this was something that was a long time coming. I'm still not sure how I feel about <EM>that</EM>. He also decided to switch his major and move to Duluth... Not just because of me, but because he has family out here that he doesn't know and wants to be a part of, and life in LA is too hard. I keep telling myself that I know this to be the complete truth because I don't want it to end up like what happened when Jake moved here.</P>
<P>Shit.</P>
<P>And so... Christmas rolled around and Winona came to visit. I miss her *so* fucking much. While I got to hang out with her, it was like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders and I could actually spend some time just being relaxed and happy. We had a mini highschool reunion at canal park inn, which was totally rocking.</P>
<P>On Christmas night, we went to see Chronicles of Narnia. At the beginning of the movie I got a text message from Chris that said ""I need you to call me right now!"" and I couldn't because I was in the movie... Anyway after, I tried to get into contact with him but he didn't answer. I kinda got freaked out and ended up waiting up all night for him to somehow tell me he was alive.</P>
<P>Next morning, I went to Target in Superior with my mom and on the way home he finally called me to tell me that all this bad stuff happened on christmas. They had to put his brother's dog down and he (the brother) freaked out and was just going nuts, so Chris had to get out of there. He ended up staying at Vanessa's for the night, but he told me nothing happened. Something was up, though, and I could tell. I've been around long enough to know when someone is obviously lying to me. I went through the whole cycle of anger, disappointment, sadness, and disgust all before he even told me what was going on. The whole day I was upset and I wasn't really consciously aware of why.</P>
<P>That night was the big party we had, and I wasn't gonna go but Winona and Emily dragged me to it anyway, and I'm so glad I went. It was probably the highlight of this year. On the way back to the hotel room from the pool, Chris called me and told me the truth and I didn't even really react. I was like ""Oh, well... Don't be so upset."" I dunno, I just feel emotionally drained all the time now. I think it's a mix of disappointment in myself and other people, and working pretty much 12 hours a day on most days of the week. Woe is me, right?</P>
<P>Since Christmas I haven't really been able to feel the same way about Chris that I did. I can't feel upset though. It's not like he *cheated* or something. We weren't officially calling it anything yet, and since he's not coming here for a long time I guess I can't really expect him to wait or something. I dunno. I've been doing a pretty good job though. Why is it that i'm somehow the only person who can go a year without having sex with someone and be okay with that? I used to think of myself as slutty but lately things have definitely made me rethink that. That wasn't a statement about Chris, either. God. Ugh.</P>
<P>Umm, oh yeah, christmas presents. I got a GBA Micro and a bunch of games from money my dad gave me&nbsp;and a nifty shirt from Darren that says ""if you can read this flip me over"" upside-down... He also got me some other stuff. Jen gave me a book about Kokology which was probably by far the most thoughtful gift I got. Definitely appreciated that. My mom got me the RE4 chainsaw and a couple other things as well. Overall I was happy with it.</P>
<P>Also on Christmas I got a text message from Jake (first time I'd heard from him since mid summer) saying something like ""I hope you're having a good holiday, driving to the cities always makes me wish it was this time last year."" Than again a couple days before New Year's he called to reminisce about new year's last year.</P>
<P>Fucking fuck. So it got me into that mode about thinking about him all the time again, which sucked ass. I was so over it and doing really well.</P>
<P>New Year's was fun, although I don't *fully* remember it. ^_^ I did manage to make up with Keith and Katie though, which was awesome.</P>
<P>Chris and I also seem to have patched things up. We are mostly calling it something official now so that's cool.</P>
<P>Last night Jake told me a ""conservative estimate"" as to how many people he's been with since we broke up. The fact that he had to give me a ""conservative estimate"" should tell you something about it. It's none of my business, but it made me feel cheap and used and shitty. Like, everything I thought was good about our relationship is turning out to be a gigantic lie and it sucks. And he tried to defend himself by saying ""this person has had sex with over 200"" and&nbsp;I didn't say anything but&nbsp;I was thinking ""a slut standing next to a bigger slut is still a slut.""&nbsp; All the old wounds got opened up and I spent a good chunk of last night just tossing and turning and unable to do anything but think about how, even though I still have feelings for him and miss him, if I ever got back together with him, it'd never be the same. All I could think about is how many people had been there since. It totally took me by surprise and it was like having the oxygen SUCKED from the room.</P>
<P>I was so angry and pissed off that all I could do was fight the urge to send him a bunch of really childish texts, which I fought off valiantly. </P>
<P>Instead I stayed up on the phone with Chris til about 3:30, not really even talking. He was really helpful, even though it was shitty to pine to my new boyfriend about my old one. He's understanding though. God knows I've tried to be there for him through this whole Vanessa thing.</P>
<P>And to end this just fabulously cheery entry, a bunch of cheesy lyrics from an Alanis Morisette song that seem to fit;</P>

Do you have children: Maybe some day, if I don't accidentally kill them.

What was your favorite date: Benihana's with Jake

How many dates till you give a kiss: It depends.

How many dates before you feel up: see previous answer.

How many dates before you possibly have sex: hahaha. Once again, it really depends.

Best kisser: Jake.

Best lover: Jake.

Have you ever been proposed to: I guess... but it turned out to be a big fat lie...

If yes, describe your proposal: no

How long was your longest relationship: a year. I hate this survey.

How short was your shortest relationship: relationship? A couple months. Four?

What is one thing you feel is most important in a relationship: actual communication

What qualities do you look for in a significant other: 
1) manliness.
2) can't be like a TV homosexual

What qualities are a major turn off in the opposite sex: I'm gonna go with same sex on this one. Being really full of himself, skanky, or like a TV homosexual.

Describe your dream wedding: Wah wah I can't marry in a church wah. Shut up christopher.

What age do you wish to be married: Lots of marriage questions. Realize that marriage only recently entered my mind as a possibility. After listening to the St.Germain family bitch-fest at Kristen's wedding, it makes it seem impossible. I really want to care what you guys and have your blessing but dammit you make it so hard. It's a sensitive topic.

Do you wish to have children: Yes but I worry that they might starve or get caught under something heavy in the basement and I wouldn't see them for weeks and I'd be like ""Where's the kid? I haven't fed it in like a week... what's going on? Oh look shiny things!""

How many children do you wish to have: Two at most.

Where would you go on your honeymoon: I don't know.

We went and signed the lease for 28 W 1st street, so that's officially the location of AllGame... Hopefully we'll be open by November 1st. They're leaving us a few desks and chairs and stuff for free, so we're happy. I'm really excited. The store is gonna rock my socks off, and owning and running my own business is going to be equally fricking awesome.

Not a WHOLE lot else going on. A few days ago we had a really major scare in which we though my dog had Distemper, because she was showing all the symptoms stretched out across the last bunch of months. My mom and I spent like a whole day crying and just freaked out because the vet said she was pretty sure it was that, but then when the tests came back, they were all negative and it turns out that it was just a *really* coincidental collection of symptoms of other things... Just, ugh though... Being faced with the possible death of my dog just floored me that whole day. It was not good. :\"

So me and Natalie pop into my car and take a <A href=""http://www.ln.edu.hk/ssc/career/featured/Wal%20Mart%203.jpg"">quick</A> <A href=""http://www.walmartgermany.de/presseservice/img/pm_singleshopping.jpg"">jaunt</A> <A href=""http://www.murtonen.net/usa/hancock&amp;houghton/original/wal-mart.JPG"">down</A> <A href=""http://fivestones.sitestream.com/img/blog/fortune_bruise.jpg"">to the</A> <A href=""http://cagle.msnbc.com/news/2004Huffaker/images/WAL-MART-1.gif"">local</A> <A href=""http://www.lisarein.com/daily/10-27-03-daily-walmart-3.jpg"">Wal Mart</A>. It was surprisingly full of people. Leave it up to the <A href=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/6305058873.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"">social masses</A> to appear at wal mart at <A href=""http://www.nmpft.org.uk/images/filmimages/dawnofthedead5.jpg"">completely inappropriate times in completely inappropriate weather</A>. We bought the movie and on the way out, noticed they had <A href=""http://www.wineenthusiast.com/images/products/thumbnails/p16430b.jpg"">an umbrella</A> that was <A href=""http://www.superiorwi.com/placed/index.php?story_id=198443&amp;view=text"">only a dollar</A>. So I bought it...</P>
<P>BRB, I have to go to the bathroom...<BR>Ok I'm back. Sorry I took so long, I was reading.</P>
<P>Anyway, I bought the umbrella. As we were leaving, I opened it to discover it was all <A href=""http://216.239.54.9/img/288/5422/640/PICT0045.jpg"">bent and fucked up and cheap</A>. For a dollar at <A href=""http://www.saveevilsmiley.com/images/evilsmileycover.jpg"">Wal Mart</A>, what was I expecting, right. Ok, so Natalie and I huddled under the umbrella and ran out to the car and she got in. I couldn't get the fricking thing back closed! So it's POURING rain and my <A href=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0007M4TCG.01-A39B6LAYBCL5SI._AA400_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg"">pajama pants</A> are now <A href=""http://www.yourmiami.com/graphics/images/index_images/index_lg/sexy_guy.jpg"">transparent</A> and <A href=""http://www.nataliedee.com/050803/attack.jpg"">I'm fighting with the fucking cheap umbrella</A>. So I shove it into the backseat.</P>
<P>""I fucking hate that thing,"" I say.</P>
<P>Natalie, with great dramatic timing, cries out, ""Let it go! Let it go! It's not worth it!""</P>
<P>So I throw the accursed umbrella into the elements and peel out with my car, only to almost smash into an <A href=""http://www.carriage-trade.com/images/Shopping-carts/Carts2.jpg"">angry mob of shopping carts</A> that were prowling the parking lot in the <A href=""http://www.computerandvideogames.com/screenshots_library/dir_39/vortal_pic_19729.jpg"">dank fog</A>.</P>
<P>So we made it home and had a fun night of well-timed thunderbursts, <A href=""http://www.villagegreenmarket.com/Merchant2/graphics/00000001/soy-pumpkin-candle.jpg"">pumpkin-smelling</A> candles, <A href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v713/Trespasser85/Image0.jpg"">bleeding indians in the bathroom causing us to freak out</A>, and <A href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v713/Trespasser85/MoandPrincess.jpg"">roommate bonding</A>. (the picture in that last link is our two cats, Mo and Princess. TEY SO CUTE!)</P>

"event","Today was, to put it lightly, VERY very strange. I woke up thinking it was just gonna be a day off like every other day off ever. I was hungry, and I had very little food, so I called my mom and asked her to come over with some food to feed me. She was like ""I have no car, but if you come over we and the dog will go to Grandma's house and we will stop to eat on the way.""

So then I jump in the shower, change, and go to her house to pick her up. We go to McDonald's and then to Grandma's house. The whole way there, we talk about random things. When we get there, I play with the dogs and a stick for a while and then go into the house to watch some TV and talk to grandma, and I hang out with mom and fall asleep for like an hour on the big armchair... I wake up and I find out that HEY, today would be the perfect day to BURY MY GRANDFATHER.

He was cremated 8 years ago, and his marker was put under a tree in my grandma's yard, and his ashes have been sitting on a shelf in her livingroom for all that time...

Anyway my uncle Kevin and aunt Liz came over with a bag of concrete and everyone but me went to put the marker in its spot on the family plot at the cemetary... Meanwhile, I run around outside throwing a hatchet at things. I managed to get it to stick into a tree, which made me happy. After a while, they got home. It was time... Grandma went in the house and grabbed grandpa's ashes and also brought out the urn containing Willie, their Doberman that died in 1989... They would be buried together. The drive to the cemetary was relatively uneventful. My grandma told a story about how she was at her friend Elsie's funeral and they poured the ashes out onto a field and she almost laughed because of a scene in a movie in which some people poured some ashes onto the sea, but they had just painted their boat and the ashes blew into it and stuck to the fresh paint. The movie was a comedy. Anyway, it was a funny story.

We got there and my uncle had two shovels and a post hole digger. I just have to point out that we were there alone and I'm pretty positive that no one ""official"" knew. Anyway he started digging and we all stood around making jokes and laughing and being really happy and taking pictures and stuff (i'll post them when I get them if I remember) and then he got tired so I dug some. I just have to say that digging your own grandpa's grave is really surreal. We got the hole to about 4 feet deep...

There was some talk as to whether we should take the ashes out of the box or just put the whole box in, and the comment was made ""well what would you keep the box for?"" and I said it would make a handsome cookie jar, and everyone laughed. My grandpa would have loved it. Then we were like, well which side should we put Willie on? Between where grandpa and grandma would be, or on the outside? My grandma's reply was ""wherever you want, cuz I'm NOT GOING.""

My mom was taking pictures and she dropped the camera or something and said loudly ""GOD DAMNIT"" and everyone was shocked, but it was funny because my Grandpa would have loved it. She was such a daddy's girl and he was totally awesome. :-( I miss him. I almost cried a couple times but by far the mood was of happiness.

So we put the dog on the outside and covered the hole in the brown dusty clay dirt and put the nice square of sod in the middle of it. VERRRRY subtle. The idea of keeping the sod was so that no one could tell we had dug there, but then there was a big pile of clay with a square of sod in it, so we just covered it with the clay anyway. 

I have this feeling that there are people in Floodwood who assume that my grandpa was buried 8 years ago, and my grandma will probably get a frantic call informing her that he's been dug up. Hehe.

Interesting story; when my mom's uncle Robin died, he was cremated and his son Chris was to pour the ashes over a lake where he lived. However, the ashes were in a seemingly indestructible bag inside the urn and no one had scissors. Luckily for them, his cousin Johnny had a screwdriver and they managed to stab it open. It ripped open quickly and some of the ashes sprayed out (like when you suddenly open a bag of M&Ms and they spray all over the place) and everyone laughed... It was all good though.

My family always has very irreverant funerals. I don't know if irreverant is really the word, but they're more like celebrations of life than mourn...ifications of death.

Anyway we went home and I excitedly told everyone about my day and then me and Natalie and Bridget and Darren and Bridget's girlfriend Idelle went to see Stuart Davis at Beaner's and let me tell you, he's amazing. I felt like my Chakras were aligned. His music is incredibly good and his stage presence is fantastic as well. Idelle's friend Al was there and he was sexy and me and Darren are in somewhat of a small war about him right now. So I have to kill him (Darren) with an uppercut and several bludgeons about the face and head."

"event","I just got home from doing a massive relay/store meeting at work. It was fun, I feel accomplished.

This weekend was Gay Pride in Duluth. I only got to go the bonfire cuz i worked through everything else. It was on friday at Wisconsin Point, and was relatively fun. I saw Jake there... The first time since we broke up. Blah. At first I had that wierd sinking feeling you get where it feels like all the blood drains from your head and you might fall over or something, but then we talked a little and it was fine, if a little awkward. I still am not entirely sure how I feel about it.

Then I guess Darren saw him at a QSU meeting today. So much for not being out. I dunno. We talked again via texting a little and I decided I want to try to be friends with him, although I'm sure that'll end like a flaming car wreck. I want to get along with him and I'd rather he have good friends like me and Darren then dumb friends who do nothing but act gay all the time and eat yogurt and talk about their clothes.

Speaking of clothes, I got the best jacket ever at the mall... haha...

It's really hot in my room. 

ZOMG!

My mom and brother gave us tons of furniture for our house! I got a nifty shelf for my room from Chris, and he also gave us his TV stand and his table and chair set.

Which matches our kitchen perfectly... 

It goes really well with our silverware which go with our dishes perfectly which go with the upcoming paint job perfectly. We have a perfectly coordinated kitchen. How awesome/creepy is that?!

And my mom gave us the big (and after it was cleaned, nice) rug for the living room as well as the bigger of her two leather couches and some other random things (a small mystery shelf, for instance, AND a papasan chair... Our livingroom is almost perfectly coordinated as well except for the big blue couch... but that's workable...)

Overall I'd say we most definitely have the best most coordinated and sassy house ever, for a bunch of college aged people. It's like season six/seven of buffy in which everyone lives in her sassy house and it's all nice. It's just like that. Darren even has a certain amount of ass-kicking skills. I guess that'd make him Buffy, which sucks. I'm still Faith though, even though my ass-kicking skills aren't quite as good. I dunno, I'm good with computers so maybe I'm Willow. But I'm not sassy computer-hacking happy Willow, I'm crazy ""I lost my one true love so now I'm going to destroy the world"" Willow... Or, maybe I'm Dawn. No I'm not Dawn. I'm Faith. Definitely Faith. I've always related to her the most, cuz she's way better than Buffy. WELLLLLL.... Maybe I can be Buffy, too. Darren can be some random Potential or something. Yeah, I like that.

Or maybe I'm kind of a mix between Faith and Buffy. Like... Baithy or Fuffy or... Faibuthy.

Yes. Faibuthy. I am Faibuthy.

And obviously, I'm really tired. Goodnight."

Then I went to work. Ugh. It sucked so much I almost quit. It was just shit fucking tastic.

I'm so stressed out it isn't even funny.

And then I get home and go on hotornot for no particular reason and what should I see? The pic I took of jake that I used to show people of him in my room smiling at me. The pic *I* took of him and was obviously *my* room. He was smiling at *me* for *me*.

I told him to take it off or I'd post pictures of him shirtless on there with keywords like ""fisting"" and ""Nascar"". I also told him he has to get me a new car stereo to replace the one I gave him to borrow that he lost.

Fucker. Anyway, I haev to work tomorrow at nine in the morning but I'm thinking ""fuck it the world can fucking suck my fucking ass and die."" I want to quit. I want to just fucking scream and break things and go crazy. Mostly work related, some jake-related, and some because Darren and I were fake fighting an he kicked me in the balls and it hurt.

I am getting along with everyone, and even though I'm still really sad about what happened with Dustin, it's a job. And a job is better than no job.

I'm doing laundry. I haven't done a single bit of laundry since like a week before I moved out of home. Heh, it's something that desperately needs to be done. I still have a bunch of boxes to unpack, but they're just full of shit and I don't really *want* to have a room full of shit again, and some of the boxes are just full of dirty laundry that I probably will never wear again. Ugh. This is the part of moving that I hate the most, the ""I have my room fully set up and a bunch of extra boxes of stuff that was supposedly important in my last house but I couldn't care less that I don't have them here"" stage of moving.

I finally have my DVD collection rebuilt after the whole Jake fiasco. All I need to get to have it completely restored is Chung King Express, which he still has, and is going to give to me. Speaking of which, he's going to be working at the Caribou in the mall. I'm just hoping we can get along. God, he's more like an ex husband than an ex boyfriend. It's just a more complicated situation for me than just a simple avoidance.

zomg! Serenity, the Firefly movie comes out on the 30th of September. I'm so fricking excited.

Speaking of so fricking excited, my mom gave me a DS yesterday. It was an extra one she had because it has no serial number and we can't sell it in the store. So I'm not too sad about selling my PSP anymore. There are rumors of yet *another* resident evil remake, this one for the DS... And it's allegedly going to have the control scheme of Resident Evil 4. No one but me cares about this.

I beat Silent Hill for the first time since ninth grade yesterday. *sigh* I heart those games so much! I totally shouldn't have been playing it in ninth grade though. Gods that game is mature.

Yesterday I was so wired all day... All day all I ate was a veggie panini for lunch with a Venti Double Mint Mocha Frappuchino with an espresso shot, two bottles of coke, a bag of Riesens, and a big bottle of coffee frappuchino from the gas station on the way home. I was really jittery and hyper, and I made delicious cheesey rice stuff that was moderately delicious. Like your mom.

It's still absolutely retarded how they expect us to get numbers and it seems like our store specifically gets bitched at more than anyone else. We are doing better than we've done in ages in the main rankings; we've been SOARING above Sue's store, yet somehow we still manage to get told that we're bringing the company down and we continue to be treated like a problem store. *sigh*

Anyway, a couple days ago I traded in my PSP. Time to admit that there aren't any good games for it and its' just a glorified MP3 player. I sold it for cash so I could get an HDTV for my room, and an HDTV I got. From Wal Mart. I'd just like to say, though, that Wal Mart is absolute shit for buying TVs. I got there, knowing *exactly* what TV I wanted. I go to it, and I point and show the electronics employee, a thirtysomething from India who clearly knows nothing about electronics. She says that they will have to check the back room. She comes back ten minutes later to inform me that there aren't any back there but that there are other similar TVs available. Of course none of them are HD-compliant or in my price range. So I point again. I say, ""I want that TV. I see it right there. Give it to me."" (in more words). She goes to check again. Oh wait, there *is* one back there. But it was returned a few days prior. Nothing wrong with it though, oh no, it's perfectly fine. But since the box is messed up I get a 10% discount.

She says everyone who can help me carry it is on break and that i have to wait a half hour. I say that i'm gonna go eat and when I get back could she have it by the counter ready for me to buy? She says yes. I leave. About forty five minutes later, I come back. Nothing is done. *sigh*

I get to the checkout counter. Swipe card. Card does not swipe. WTF? Lady manually enters amount, has no fucking idea how to run her till. Was she trained yesterday? Probably. I get 10% off, but only after waiting ANOTHER ten minutes for a shift supervisor to key it in.

I get home FINALLY after hours of waiting. Box is shit. Remote lacks batteries. Styrofoam shredded.

TV Defective.

Shocked and appalled, I bring it in the next day. I leave the TV in Darren's truck and go in. Woman acts like I'm crazy. How could Wal Mart possibly sell ME, the valued customer, something that is shit. Oh I don't know, maybe it's a lack of standards in their hiring practices.

I get her to listen, and she gets someone with a trolley to help me bring the TV back in. Of course it's Tim Kacer, the one kid I've ever been in a fight with, in 6th grade. I won. He's still tall and freaky and creepy and child-molestery as ever as he brings his *shopping cart* to help bring in my 27-inch HDTV.

I try to do the return, she says they don't have any left. I say there's a display unit that seemed to be working just fine, and could they please give me an even exchange? They say ok. Old woman butts in front of me and stays there. I continue to finish my problem as old woman stands there like moron. Eventually the woman at the customer service desk gives me a *gift card* for the amount I paid for the TV. I go to the electronics section where they were warned half an hour prior that I was coming to get the display model. No one is there. Eventually a manager shows up. Tells me my TV that I bought wasn't actually a return, but it came new that way. It came to Wal Mart opened, with the documents crumpled, the styrofoam shredded, and the batteries for the remote missing. Ri-ight. Either someone in their warehouse needs to be fired or someone in their electronics department needs to be shot.

He tells me it's going to be at least forty-five minutes before they can get the ever-so-heavy TV down so I can take it home. I say I'm going to go eat. I go eat. An hour and a half later, we return. The TV is still being displayed, plugged in. Only now there's a ladder leaning up against the wall next to it.

He shows up and he and Tim bring it down, almost dropping it. It takes approximately two seconds.

The manager tells them not to give me the discount. This display is new.

Even though it's caked with dust on top.

I resist the urge to punch said manager.

Eventually I get the 10% off and the TV, begrudgingly from the manager, who acts like I'm trying to shoplift even though they lied to me a few times and sold me shit. Like he can't just be like, ""sorry for the inconvenience, I hope you come back."" Valued customer my ass. The guy needs to be slapped.

Moral of the story; Wal Mart is the worst fucking place in the world and I would have to be paid to ever shop there again. I love my TV though, it's great.

So today at work, I processed all our defective merchandise to be sent out to the warehouse, something which I've done twice before and is normally Randy's job. It was pretty easy but kinda time-consuming and it took me a while to figure out how exactly to do it. Then I processed like three and a half months of paperwork that our manager was supposed to have been keeping up with every monday. It took me about two hours, and I've never done it before, ever. No one has told me how, either, but I figured it out and got it done. It made me feel really good to know that I had done two higher-management jobs by myself without provocation or training, and I had done them *right* and *well* and that I had figured out how to do them myself.

Then the realization occured to me that I will never get any positive credit for doing so. Yes I did a fabulous job and got shit done that's needed to be done for months and was self-sufficient enough to figure out how to do it by myself, but who cares? I will get nothing but a small pat on the back. It will be forgotten in two days' time. *sigh*"

And my mom gave me her flatscreen monitor because I needed to save some room in my room. I'm also not taking that horrible horrible TV. I'm gonna save up and eventually buy a better one. Until then I can play my PS2 on my computer screen.

So I have my own room now that's huge and stuff and yay and I pay rent and feel good. Very good!

Still kinda working on setting things up and I have to get some stuff from Mom's house still, and clean up there. I feel kinda sad. She cried before I left... Mom has *never* lived alone. It was from her family to my dad to me and chris... And now she lives alone with The Beast. I hope she's ok.

"event","So. Yes. God.

Religion. I just watched Constantine... The movie wasn't particularily good (in my opinion) but there were a couple things that jumped out at me that got me to thinking. And I'm more my dad's son than I'd like to admit. There's a part where this half-angel half-human woman tells Constantine (in a catholic church) that, because he commited suicide, he's fucked and going to Hell no matter what he does. The first thing that popped in my head was, ""Oh come on, everyone knows that, according to Christianity, if you ask for forgiveness in your heart that God will let you into Heaven. An Angel would never be such a bitch to him about it."" Haha. She turned out to be evil in the end, anyway, but still...

Anyway... I guess I'm more Christian than I realized. I guess I believe in God and the Devil and stuff, but part of it is that it doesn't matter to me. I don't think God put us here to bitch at each other about who God is, or to try to figure out where we came from. Yeah our roots are important, but I don't think that it matters that far back. The only one key thing that I think God wants us to figure out, and the one thing that I think that humanity is *completely* missing the point on, is that we're all here. Right now. On this planet. Together. No matter who we are, what we believe in, what color we are, sexual orientation, social status, whatever... We're all here, and we should deal with it and get along. Instead of looking backwards at where we came from and who made us, we should be looking at making the world a better place for everyone.

I think that the idea that you have to have some kind of institution between you and God is ridiculous. He (for the sake of being irritated, I'm gonna refer to God as He even though really I don't think that God is a He or a She) is all over the place. (Like in Stigmata) God is in everything, rocks, trees, wood, people, animals, everything. If you stop to appreciate what's around you, you'd know that you don't have to go into a church and have someone tell you a bunch of Dogmatic bullshit that God is too big to really care about anyway. You think God is really going to be that offended if you eat pork on friday? No... God is so much bigger than anyone can even begin to fathom. He has more important things on his mind, I'm sure.

Religion was once used to explain where we were from and used as a basic guideline for people, but it has become a tool of oppression. Wars are fought over it, people die for it and because of it, and people disown their children because of stupid details.

I think God meant for us to be a little more laid-back about it. Preaching at people isn't going to change their minds... Lead by example."

Yesterday I traded in a few psp games and got a second super-thick raised-buttoned dance pad, and I safety-pinned them together so it's like one just really big super-thick raised-buttoned dance pad. Anyway playing double pad is a lot more fun than just single. Even though both are awesome.</P>
<P>I also got Britney's Dance Beat, but unfortunately, the game is stupid. It only has FIVE songs. FIVE. That's *it*.</P>

"event","I ran into <A href=""http://lifesite.net/features/harrypotter/"" target=_blank>this article</A> today. All the links at the bottom to all the essays seem to be dead, or at least most of them.<BR><BR>Pretty convincing article.<BR><BR>Here's the thing. Normal people (the ones not in the religion club) can separate reality from fiction. Believing in religion requires you to believe in magical forces (god, or miracles, or angels watching us, or life after death, etc), by proxy. Because these religious crazies already believe in magic, they think that the rest of us normals have the same trouble they do - separating what is ""good magic"" and what is ""bad magic"".<BR><BR>For example: Jesus walking on water - good magic. Harry Potter flying on broomstick - bad magic. Moses' religious leaders turning staves into snakes - good magic. Harry potter speaking snake toung - bad magic. Jesus reviving Lazerus from the dead. Good......... good magic? Voldemort rising from the dead. A few times. Bad magic.<BR><BR>Now, their problem with Harry Potter is that it's so close to what they believe, but it involves cauldrons and broomsticks, and there's no mention of ""God"", and as such, they have to denounce it as ""bad magic"" and a ""gateway to the occult"" (leading children into a world of bad magic rather than their branch of good magic).<BR><BR>The rest of us simply look at the whole nine yards, think about it critically for half a second and say ""the laws of physics dictate that there is no such thing as magic and everything can be explained by rational means"". Then we assess Harry Potter as a harmless work of fiction, which is what it is. The religious can't accept the harmless work of fiction theory because it leads to the conclusion that their branch of ""Hogwarts"" (""the church"") might also be a work of fiction, and no one who has spent their whole lives believing in something likes to have the carpet pulled out from under them.<BR><BR>Well.............. Surprise!!<BR><BR><FONT size=1>For those that wonder why I ever go into religious topics with such disdain... it's been made into my predisposition. It's been shoved in my face for so long and each news article gets more and more ridiculous. These are my opinions - it's not a statement of affiliation in any way to anybody. No, not even the bad guys. Only politicians say ""If you're not with us, you're against us."" Christian fundimentalist politicians who just happen to be pretty much the most powerful men in the free world. <B>That's</B> a rant for a different time that's not my [brother's]&nbsp;birthday.</FONT>"

"event","What is with this insanely hot weather? I wish it'd stay this hot, but be about 90% less humid.

Right now I feel really queasy and I dont' know why. Like the kind of feeling you have after not eating anything for several days, only I have eaten today and I ate yesterday a lot. So I don't know what the big deal is.

Speaking of eating a lot, I gained seven pounds and should start playing more DDR.

Work was heinously boring today, of course as always."

<P>Yeah it was just like that. JUST like it.</P>
<P>Only better.</P>
<P>Anyway I went to see the fireworks last night with Kathy, Alicia, and Amanda, and it was really fun. But that's for closer to the end of the story.</P>
<P>Yesterday I went to my uncle Kevin's house and we ate meat and it was good. My brother Chris brought me home and we almost died when he decided to merge onto the freeway going about 80, into a space between two trucks that was roughly half the length of his car.</P>
<P>Fun shit.</P>
<P>THEN I went home and was bored, until I went to the fireworks. And yes I kissed Alicia and Kathy. I'm such a manslut.</P>
<P>We then met up with Darren and went to Perkins where we had quesadillas and got bussed by a guy named Dobby or Dilbert or something.</P>
<P>Overall it was a&nbsp;holiday that exceeded my expectations.</P>"

"event","This semester I'm fulfilling my last Business Breadth requirement with a Healthcare Management course.  Thought it would be useful.

It is.  But right now my studying is severely hampered by bouts of anger.  Is the public simply brain-dead?  (Never mind, we all know the answer to that.)  Can anything good come about without full dependance on the nature of politics?  (Well, we know that, too.)

OK, folks.  I love low prices.  Really, really love 'em, a frickin' lot.  And generic drugs rock my world.  But the new technology has to come from somewhere.  <em>Someone</em> has to figure out what new molecules will make unpleasant (debilitating, life-threatening) illnesses go away.  So do not make it any harder for the drug companies to get their products to market, or to sell them.  <em>They</em> are not the big bad wolf.

Have any of these advocates looked into how many failed attempts these research firms have, how much it costs for <em>one drug</em> to come from idea to realization and <em>then</em> pass the FDA's stringent tests--the FDA that has a significant political incentive <em>not</em> to approve new medicines?  How long it takes?  Do they even think about that?  This scene of drug prices <em>is</em> part of a big picture.  For once this is not about big firms just trying to screw people over, and all these people want to do is look at the short-term solutions.  <em>As always.</em>

Seriously, that Donna Shalala had balls to refuse to enact the importation law that politicians on both sides used in election year in lieu of facing the Medicare crisis as a pretend show of love for the public.  Fortunately she had evidence from the actual proposed law to back up her action, not just the fact that it would actually help lead to a drug crisis of medicines not existing a decade or so in the future.  But to keep going with this example, if we look at all the crises that our country has faced over the years, consider how many of them could have been prevented if politicians hadn't been pressured by the short-term-oriented, dumb-but-vocal* segments of the population to make pretenses of bringing about solutions that only ultimately compounded the problem.

Come to that, a great many <em>individual</em> medical crises (e.g. heart disease) could be prevented or greatly reduced if people just looked a few years in the future and made some minor lifestyle changes <em>now</em>, rather than waiting to get bitch-slapped by a coronary or other severe symptom to start caring about solving a problem that could have been kept from arising in the first place?

Seriously, it is <em>painful</em> for me to read about all these changes and attempted changes to the drug industry that come about because of the public's dumb perspective on just and only the immediate present.

Take the FDA for example.  It was made to regulate <em>food</em> (after some public outcries over media attention on a few specific cases).  We should have an FA and a DA, and that DA should be held just as accountable for statistical lives lost because of standing in the way of a wonder drug as it currently is for identifiable lives impacted when it approves a drug that causes too many or too extreme adverse ""side""-effects.  It should not take drug companies pairing with advocacy groups for various illnesses (like breast cancer) to give the FDA some incentive to consider blocking drug approval an unacceptable error.  (Or lower the goddamn repercussions for letting a ""bad"" drug get through.  Balance, folks.)  Speaking of which . . .

So, the FDA is never scrutinized by Congress for statistical lives lost/negatively impacted, only identifiable ones.  They only get pressure when an advocacy group can catch media attention and bring a political incentive for the FDA to move its ass on approval.  (This is a bad situation to start with, asking the impossible of an already-screwed-up government organization that I am usually criticizing, not siding with.)  But when it takes media attention for a political push, it means that only groups that can gain sympathy can get that push.  While breast cancer supporters have sponsored Walks to gain funding for medical research, supporters of mental health patients are having Walks to stamp out stigma.  The people who commit suicide or just have no real lives because the FDA hasn't approved a certain drug (yet) are hardly even identifiable as statistics, so much less than patients with physical health problems.  It doesn't capture the public goodwill to stand up and say, ""Because XYZ Drug Company had to overcome so many scientific, economic, regulatory, and political hurdles to bring drug A to market, I've been lying in bed all the time for the past twenty years, living off of welfare.""  If statistical mental health patients adversely affected by drugs not being invented or coming to market try to become identifiable human beings, those identified will be ostracized.  This is the most invisible bunch.

So people make a million contradictory demands of the FDA, making a fuss whenever something spectacular happens, wanting short-term results, and ignore all the invisible victims of this mess.  I've cut so many examples of idiotic things out of this post because it just made me too upset to hash through them again.  <strong>We can't have everything.</strong>  I hate it, too.  But I'd rather have drugs on the market that can dramatically improve or even save my and other people's lives than have them not get created because people bitched about high <em>coinsurance</em> for the drugs that were improving and saving <em>their</em> lives at the time--and got political support for it.  The money to research and invent the drugs has to come from somewhere, so suck it up.  I have.  I will continue to do so.  Because people need those drugs to have good lives, and I want them available to me and those I love when one of us comes down with a severe illness. 

We live in a big picture.  Putting a Band-Aid on a ruptured artery will only help for a millisecond.

Besides, can't these people at least bitch intelligently?

Back to the books.  Let's see how far I get before I have to vent to someone again to prevent my head from exploding in seething anger at the dumb masses in a society that only changes with political support, or get mortally bored from the book telling me things that I already know while sprinkling in infuriating examples of said stupidity.  Until next time, folks.

"event","With exams looming large and the semester coming to a close, I can't help but look to the future.&nbsp; What's on the horizon?<br /><br />Er, the other horizon.&nbsp; Turn around; I'm pointing that way. <br /><br />My linguistics class, cross-listed under everything from computer science to philosophy and really a cognitive science class at heart, amid a discussion of emotions and where they (may or may not) come from, we had a little discussion about metaphors.&nbsp; Dead metaphors, to be precise--meaning the metaphors that are so alive in day-to-day speech that the meanings are universally accepted.&nbsp; My exams aren't really getting bigger, the school semester isn't snapping shut like a bear-trap, and my college course doesn't have a muscle beating blood steadily through its body, but you knew what I&nbsp;meant.&nbsp; The classic example would be, &quot;You were all so sweet to post and let me know that you actually read my blog!&quot;&nbsp; You guys don't actually taste similar to sugar.&nbsp; But it still made me feel all warm and fuzzy seeing your comments.<br /><br />When I&nbsp;say &quot;universally,&quot;&nbsp;what I actually mean is, throughout all of English and, often, worldwide.&nbsp; Dirty is bad.&nbsp; Up is good.&nbsp; Heavy is important.&nbsp; Warm is nice.&nbsp; <span style=""font-style: italic;"">In every language</span><em>.</em>&nbsp; To me, that's pretty amazing.&nbsp; Of course, it comes with a logic.&nbsp; I&nbsp;won't go into it entirely, in case you already know or don't care, but these cross-cultural connotations aren't the only ones.&nbsp; <br /><br />As in so many other language-related areas, some rules have exceptions--light and dark, for instance, with white being the color of death in Japan.&nbsp; The most confounding one to me though is that in a small handful of languages, you don't move forward into the future.&nbsp; I would be able to wrap my mind around sweet having a negative meaning.&nbsp; But looking backward into the future?&nbsp; How does that work?<br /><br />Perhaps most incredible to me is just <em>how much</em> that <em>so many</em> of these &quot;core&quot;&nbsp;dead metaphors are wildly difficult, even up through now impossible, for my mind to process in the opposite direction.&nbsp; I cannot imagine calling someone a cold person and meaning that he or she is really friendly.&nbsp; This could have something to do with the fact that <em>cold</em> now has an English definition of not-friendly (and various other negative concepts), but I'm pretty sure it's more than that.&nbsp; Despite the fact that I rather like the cold, comparing anything to being cold and considering this good still blows my mind more than I&nbsp;like to admit . . . and warm happens to be one of the really worldwide dead metaphors.&nbsp; If it has any exceptions, my professor didn't mention them. <br /><br />Above all, though, the future being behind me?&nbsp; I've been trying for a day to make this work in my mind, and I still can't.&nbsp; I write stories, read books and watch shows in which time-travel is either possible or a norm, and I (thought I) stopped thinking of time as linear a long time ago.&nbsp; But in all those fictional media, people travel backward to the past and forward to the future.&nbsp; I suppose that this means I&nbsp;still think of time as a line--disappointing, that.&nbsp; Changing that perspective will have to be a goal. &nbsp;<br /><br />Until then, I&nbsp;guess I'll just have to look Back to the Future of exams and prospective semi-freedom during winter break.&nbsp; Getting through the month behind won't be a picnic, but if I&nbsp;put my nose to the grindstone I&nbsp;ought to be able to come out on top.<br /><br /><br />-----------------------------<br />(Yes, I know some of those are idiomatic expressions.&nbsp; Metaphors all the same. :-p )"

"event","So far I've compiled this list: <br /><br />Monster<br />Power Edge<br />Red Bull <br />XS Energy<br />Relentless<br />Bolt<br />5-Hour Energy<br /><br />The only ones I have any first-hand confirmation on are Red Bull and 5-Hour Energy.  The others I saw under searches on the web for vegan energy drinks.  This is by no means a comprehensive list. <br /><br />I'm making this post primarily on the off-chance that someone searching for the words &quot;Which energy drinks are vegan?&quot; or &quot;Which energy drinks are vegetarian?&quot; or &quot;Which energy drinks don't have animal ingredients?&quot; will see this and find it helpful, as I've done that search myself.  It would be really nice if the manufacturers would specify.<br /><br />A while back I emailed Mana, and am still awaiting a response.  Those things seem pretty cool.  Unfortunately, I have yet to find an inexpensive energy drink.  The only reason I buy them at all is that without them I can't make it to or not sleep through classes, and compared to the price of my university it makes sense to suffer the cost, as a type of &quot;school expense.&quot;<br /><br />Speaking of that, I'm back in school.  If anyone still reads this pretty-much-dead-journal, I'll try to get around to posting further about that and other interesting tidbits.  <br />(<strong>If you read this, can you just leave a comment, even if it's simply one random letter or symbol?</strong>  As an anonymous guest if you want?  <br />I just want to know if it's worth the time and effort of starting this thing up again.  I like being in more regular touch with people outside my revolving-college-door world, but if no one reads this, then that's not really achieving the end, and the means are consuming of what have now become more valuable resources.)"

"event","Okay, I said last entry that my next entry would be about shiny new electronics.&nbsp; And then I found myself putting off writing an entry until I had adequate time and energy to write one befitting the Shiny New Electronics in my apartment.&nbsp; So, sorry.&nbsp; Let's just say, another entry.&nbsp; Hopefully the next. <br /><br />Today I had some time to hang out with my neighbors . . . of over a year.&nbsp; It was three months after beginning to sleep in my apartment that I finally got a bed, and a year and three months before I really got to know my closest neighbors aside from the kid screaming upstairs and the occasional &quot;Hi&quot; in the hallways.<br /><br />Above me lives a little boy with his father and his babysitter (also male).&nbsp; I went to talk to the caretaker guy, J, because he's knowledgeable in the world of golden ratios and more spiritual stuff.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the more negative stuff comes to mind first, which I consider a human failing since he's a nice and educated guy.&nbsp; I learned he is a self-proclaimed hippie who doesn't believe that addiction is anything more than a cop-out to hide behind.&nbsp; The arrogant dismissal of mental illnesses angers me, especially since I have so many people close to me who have been or are struggling with various ailments that are as real as diabetes, just harder to <em>see</em>.&nbsp; The hippie part is partly negative because it leads to him holding some pretty out-there beliefs, (and I am not a person who dismisses any theory out-of-hand) and something else that I won't post publicly.&nbsp; <br /><br />He's also pretty cool in many regards.&nbsp; He knows a lot about hexagons, the Golden Ratio, current events, and non-religious spirituality.&nbsp; I like the food for thought he brings and the intelligent conversation he can hold.&nbsp; He's well-informed and will cite his sources.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm just having some trouble describing my time with him without bitching about his prejudice.&nbsp; (Yes, I realize the irony of that.)&nbsp; I'll have to come back to it sometime, because I did spend a while upstairs enjoying myself in conversation with him. <br /><br />The little boy, Jacob, is a pain in the ass.&nbsp; I do not like little kids.&nbsp; I do not like little kids.&nbsp; I do not like little kids.&nbsp; I'm getting a little used to them, grazie a Master Phan's two little girls, but I do not like little kids.&nbsp; Jacob is probably cute.&nbsp; To most people.&nbsp; To my surprise I was able to tolerate him, which includes interacting with him in the stupid, little-kid way.<br />Now, saying he's a pain in the ass doesn't mean he's a particularly bratty kid.&nbsp; It means he's at least a normal little kid.&nbsp; It's for a reason that I don't want to have kids. <br /><br />I had a really good time hanging out with Jacob's father, MGJ.&nbsp; He's a really decent guy with a very good work ethic.&nbsp; And he knows how to cook and might very well teach me.<br /><br />Gosh, I'm all tired out from bitching that now I don't feel like lauding MG and talking about my nice time with him.&nbsp; This is a lesson:&nbsp; Do the positive stuff first.&nbsp; It's probably healthier, anyway.<br /><br />I feel like this entry was so lame, but once I lay down to write it the tiredness just swept over me."

And I must say that I'm not surprised at the people who did respond as such.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And thanks for the answer--That'll be most helpful as I try to enjoy this Chinese movie without subtitles.&nbsp;

VoIP<br /><br />So, I need some papers from a fuckface in Japan.&nbsp; His general method of dealing with demands from his first wife demanding necessary paperwork for their biological offspring by certain deadlines is to wait several months and then either give in or procrastinate some more, often with a nasty email or two thrown into the mix.<br /><br />I need some papers from him.&nbsp; I hate the <em>need</em>, but he is biologically and legally bound to me, no matter what either of us might like to do about it.&nbsp; So I need these papers from him (from his employers, actually), and I need them NOW.&nbsp; I really, <em>really</em> don't want to wait months and months for this.&nbsp; I can't keep putting my life on hold every time he decides to be incompetent.&nbsp; <br /><br />My mother contacts him via email.&nbsp; Once he accidentally called her from a VoIP phone, so she got his number.&nbsp; But according to her, it's ridiculously expensive to call it, thereby negating the possibility of its usefulness as a faster means of reaching him. <br /><br />The number is 011-815-055395524.&nbsp;<br />(Yes, I'm posting this in a completely public entry.&nbsp; I know, I know.&nbsp; Yes, I <em>know</em>.&nbsp; This is an educated decision.) <br /><br />I have Skype.&nbsp; I also have Pidgin.&nbsp; I can play with them and find a way to contact him gratis, but at the moment I have had it up to my eyeballs in <strike>troubleshooting</strike> playing with computer problems, and I just frickin' don't feel like it.<br />(In my next entry some further computer updates.&nbsp; More frustration, but also excitement.&nbsp; Still could use help on the VoIP though.)<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Frustrated <br /><br />a)&nbsp; Xubuntu &amp; DVDs<br /><br />One of the laptops that I thought was broken (based on someone else's statements) turned out not to be.&nbsp; Yea!&nbsp; Well, not completely.&nbsp; Boo.&nbsp; The fan is wonky.&nbsp; As in, unpredictable.&nbsp; Sometimes it works fine, sometimes it just won't go.&nbsp; When I went to visit the computer guy, it acted like a naughty child and ran perfectly in the presence of a stranger. <br /><br />Anywho, I installed Xubuntu on it.&nbsp; (It has ridiculously little RAM.)&nbsp; And here's the frustrating part: I can't get DVD's to play.&nbsp; I've downloaded various plug-ins and codecs, but no success.&nbsp; I checked out the ubuntu help page, and their suggestions didn't work.&nbsp; <br /><br />ARG!!!<br /><br />I really like being able to play DVD's on a computer.&nbsp; It drives me UP THE WALL that I have to go through all this effort, still without success, just because the OS is OS as opposed to proprietary!<br />(And yes, the optical drive can handle DVD's.&nbsp; It ran a DVD just before I installed Xubuntu on it.)<br /><br />Any help in this area would be exceedingly appreciated.<br /><br />b)&nbsp; Party drunks<br /><br />The other day, when I began writing this entry--Friday, I think--it was really nice weather out so I decided to take a walk.&nbsp; Some neighbors were hanging out with friends on their front porch, and I crashed their little gathering.&nbsp; Little did I know that I actually was crashing a party, one of Drexel students to celebrate the end of finals.<br /><br />At first it was cool.&nbsp; The hanging out was fun, except for the cigarette smoke, and the fact that they were having beers and I wasn't seemed to be no issue.&nbsp; We had relatively intelligent conversation.&nbsp; It was nice to hang out with people about my age on a nice day. <br /><br />More and more came.&nbsp; It continued to be nice.&nbsp; One of the guys went to my high school, and we chatted about that.&nbsp; I met a couple of nerds, and talking with them was fun. <br /><br />And then they started to get drunk. <br /><br />Now this isn't something I really recognized until after leaving.&nbsp; Just somehow it became less and less enjoyable.&nbsp; I left around 23:30, when a group started playing flip-cup on the back porch.&nbsp; I can see almost absolutely no appeal to that game.&nbsp; I suppose if you're tipsy or drunk it becomes funny, but I found no amusement or entertainment in watching people take shots of beer and then turn cups upside-down.&nbsp; It seemed utterly pointless. <br /><br />On other occasions I have felt left out by the fact that I don't drink any kind of alcohol.&nbsp; That evening I didn't.&nbsp; It was just how it was.&nbsp; I <em>did</em> find some small, unexpected feeling of being left out by the fact that I've never even tried weed.&nbsp; While they were still decently sober, one pointed out that I shouldn't put down marajuana or the use thereof without ever having tried it (though I at that point hadn't, in fact, done any such thing).&nbsp; But kung-fu has put me in touch with a lot of mind-body, spiritual-type connections, and put me in touch with people who know what it is to be desperately trying to quit because it has fucked up their lives.&nbsp; I have seen the effects, albeit on a small scale, but even that small scale is quite significant.&nbsp; In general I figure people can do what they like with their own bodies, so long as it isn't hurting others, but seeing my good friend(s) so addicted and terrified for his/her/their life/lives . . . It does put things in perspective. <br />Also, Master Phan has a strong policy in terms of drugs--of any sort.&nbsp; The most I've seen him do is a few sips of tea.&nbsp; He keeps his body clean, and he is truly a Master, at several arts.&nbsp; A humble, down-to-earth man, and a true Master.&nbsp; (Not a term I use lightly.)&nbsp; And he holds keeping the body pure in such high regard, that my opposition to any legal or illegal drug (prescription ones mostly excluded) has amped up radically.<br /><br />But I'm beside the point.&nbsp; I don't drink, I don't do drugs, and I don't want to.&nbsp; I didn't feel left out, or envious; I just felt a lack of fun.&nbsp; Looking at Indian movies--<em>Dhoom, Dhoom 2, Bend It Like Beckham</em>--they know how to have a super time without getting drunk.&nbsp; Why can't we??<br /><br />It's just frustrating and annoying.&nbsp; And give me a general feeling of a lower mood; the words that come to mind are &quot;mi dispiace.&quot;&nbsp; Even if they have to drink, can't they just do a little, so they can keep up a semi-intelligent conversation??<br /><br />Geez. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;"">---------------------</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br /><em>Next Entry:&nbsp; Much more happy stuff!&nbsp; Computers, OS's, and hubs!&nbsp; Oh my!&nbsp; Squealing, and grinning, and </em><em>screaming like a banshee at things that don't work and things that aren't there and things that take way way too long!</em><em>&nbsp; <br />Hurrah!</em></div>"

"event","In a certain fantasy series, a man does not get to gain years until he has received his sword.  A grown man may refer to himself as being five years old. <br /><br />Once someone told me of her gay friend who counted the day she came out of the closet as her birthday.  She celebrated it as the beginning of her new life.  <br /><br />In China they tell kids at the new year that everyone is now a year older.  The new year is celebrated for several days, incidentally ending today-the-27th.  <br />Interesting that it should go from the New Moon to the Full Moon.  For today-the-28th is a 100% full Full Moon.  (Still a waxing gibbous, according to Google Desktop; a 14.74 day-old moon, but let's not be so anally picky.  It's the fully full moon.)<br /><br />And that bright moon glows over my 9th birthday.  According to Master Phan, 9 is a lucky number (as much as he puts stock in such things, which he doesn't much).  And the 28th of February is the date on which, 9 years ago, I came home from school, went to get an after-school snack, and said, &quot;Hey, wait!, it's Lent!  I think I'll go vegan for Lent this year.&quot;  Silently I added, &quot;And <font size=""-2"">probably</font> forever after . . . but I don't have to mention that aloud to Mom just yet.&quot;<br /><br />That was the last Lent I ever celebrated.<br /><br />That day at lunchtime was the last time I knowingly and consensually ate dairy cheese.  <br />(A few mistakes have taken place over the years, but those were always utter mistakes.  It's weird what they sneak into things, sometimes!)<br /><br />I was already a vegetarian.  <br />As Donald Watson [the man who coined &quot;<span style=""background: rgb(0, 255, 255) none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); display: inline ! important; font-size: inherit ! important;"" class=""GBL-Highlighted"">vegan</span>ism&quot;] would have said, I started with vegetarianism and took it through to its logical conclusion.<br /><br />So the full moon shines brightly on my ninth birthday!&nbsp; I'll be celebrating the whole lifestyle, taking a shower with animal-friendly toiletries, going out in my newly-polished-with-&quot;100% Vegan No Bull&quot;-brand, non-leather, fashionable boots, dropping by a yarn store with friends and not buying wool or silk yarn, then going out to celebrate with my mother and a boyfriend at a Chinese vegan restaurant and getting, among other delicious delicacies, the chocolate vegan cheesecake that I love so much.&nbsp; Hanging out with my mother whom (if I may put it in these self-centered terms) I made vegan.&nbsp; Who supports me through moments of weakness strain, and whom I support in return.&nbsp; Who guards and loves my two daughters who came from the streets in need of a home, a warm lap, and a soft touch."

"event","What else would make me say that I heart something?  What else could possibly cause me to abandon normal sanity and use the ""<3"" combination of symbols?  <a href=""http://www.sevenmountainskungfu.com/htmls/aboutphan.html"">Seven Mountains Spirit Fist Kung-Fu</a> is more than just a place to learn a martial art and more than just a school.  It's a family. 

I haven't written too much about this family.  I know.  Well I don't post much anyway.  And this is so special that I wasn't sure I even wanted to post about it.

I've known about and liked Seven Mountains Spirit Fist for a long time.  I've wanted to go for a long time.  Since my freshman year of college, in fact.  But it isn't a place for quitters or half-hearted students.  It's a school for devoted learners, and has a minimum attendance requirement [for testing to advance].  I wanted to go knowing that not only could I make this minimum requirement, but that I could devote the energy I needed to learning the art.  In the last month I've decided to devote even more time and energy, as I've come to appreciate the school family, art form, and spirit envelopment even more. 

What incites this night's rant of fondness?  Well, we go out to dinner every so often.  Or, we can--some people go and basically everybody is invited to come, and the main family members always go.  The central character is always the wonderful Master Phan, a man whom I have no issue deferring to and calling ""master.""  (If you know me, you know that's unusual.  Way unusual.)  I go every chance I get.  And--spectacular!--we always go to a vegan place, one of my favorites, Harmony (in Chinatown), for the Master is vegetarian as are many people in the school.  But it's not a cheap place, and we don't order individually (we eat Chinese style!), and the cost has started to strain.  No, let me put that in a more directly past sense: the cost has strained me beyond acceptability.  Tuition to the school itself is expensive enough.  So tonight I said I'd come along for the company, and just order a tiny thing for myself.  

Well, the red sashes wouldn't have it.  I now lie in bed, stuffed full of delicious vegan Chinese food, and filled just as much with a feeling of warmth at the generosity and familiarity that the others at the school have shown toward me. 

The feeling of a family connection is not unique to me.  One of the senior members, getting married in May, is inviting only three people who do not go to the school.  (I haven't heard anything about me being invited, but hell, I think he planned the wedding before I started.) Those three are from something of another (non-biological) family.  Some people have gotten the name, usually in the Chinese characters, tattooed onto themselves.  I've spoken with others about how close-knit and supportive the group is.

Is this love I have for Seven Mountains, one* might ask, just a honeymoon period?  Is it part of the traditionally-three-month infatuation stage that takes place with new couples?  The answer is empirically negative.  For one, I have been attending the school quite longer than three months.  Also, my affection and loyalty have grown as time passes.  My increased attendance was a carefully considered decision, which I discussed first with an external party.  I know, on a conscious, intellectual level, many of which of my needs it fulfills and why.  And, the family air has invited me in.  They treated me as one of them before I considered myself such.

Now I could probably go on for quite some time about Seven Mountains Spirit Fist Kung-Fu.  But for now I'll leave it at that.  It's fantastic.  They're fantastic.  And I heart them.

"event","We got snow.  More than we've had in eons.  I blame (and credit) the originator of the title quote (as he obviously has some cosmic power to jinx snow into being) for bringing all this on.  I was so warm and lazy today, taking public transit everywhere.  No bike riding for me.  (No bike lanes!)

I should really try writing my name in snow sometime.  It's a new idea. 

Done a lot of writing lately, leaping from genre to genre, storyline to storyline, mood to wildly different mood (in the stories).  Usually I'm just in the mood for one feeling of story, but I've been writing a lighthearted short story and an at-this-moment-in-writing terribly depressed longer story, flipping between the two with absolutely insane ease and alacrity.  That's just weird. 

My poor little Dell is still out.  I'm very, very sad about that.  Desperately hope that it'll come back online, but I may end up having to rebuild it.  Fancy that--rebuilding a laptop before I've even built my first desktop.

Kung-fu tonight was wild fun.  Unfortunately Master Phan won't let me test at three months: I have to wait six before testing for the first time, even though the test isn't until mid-January and I've almost got Dragon and Crane down now.  A really funny event happened when the class went to do Five Elements, and Jesper called me over as if I'd been slacking, and I said, ""I don't know Five Elements!"" and he said, ""You do now.  You know enough to follow along.  Come on.""  

So I've done Five Elements.  I think the fifth is Snake . . . not sure.  But I <em>did</em> manage to follow along (they did it quite slowly) <em>on the spot</em>, <em>in the middle of class</em>, despite the fact that I've never done a hook kick in my life.  What I couldn't do, I faked.  Sort of.  Still tried to keep good form and all, but I could only do so much, doing a new form for the very first time right in the middle of class. 

Unfortunately I'll be away from kung-fu for a week. :'-(  I'll be practicing on my own, though--and if Ebe throws a fit, I will (feel a very strong urge to but refrain from) totally go tiger-monkey-snake-crane batshit woolly on her.  Maybe that'll be enough to scare her off.  I'm dedicated to this art form, and I need to practice.  It's bad enough that I'm missing class. (Phan would leave the studio open over all the Christian holidays if he weren't trying to make this fit well enough into American society!)  This is a long-term study that requires devotion, and I intend to give it, so far as I'm able. 

Another thing that sucks about going away is that I have to make sure I use up any leftovers or such things as won't last if left for a little while.  Oh, and there's the inconvenience of library items that I have to return, or make sure are sufficiently renewed.  God, travel sucks . . . at least in several regards.  (Overall I'd say travel is awesome.  Being at the destinations is, at least.) 

Okay, enough chatter.  I've had a tiring day; I'd best be getting some shut-eye."

"event","Let's amend that title with something slightly longer: 

Using new things is good.  It's a good part of expanding life.  Doing new things is, in general, good.  But don't jump into 9 foot water if you've never been in water before.  So, moderation and common sense are your friends.  They would be my friends too, if I treated them more nicely. 

Now, particularly don't use never use something that can on occasion be dangerous, then use it in such a way that the package has very explicit warnings about.  

What was my something?  Oil.  I hardly ever use it in cooking.  Teflon pans and cooking spray.  Much healthier.  But, on occasion, not as tasty.  So, last night I had the uncanny craving for french fries.  And I had some in my freezer, a bag which I'd opened long, long ago in a galaxy--er, state--far, far away--erm, quite some miles away.  Usually I bake them.  But I thought, to hell with it, I want those terrible, greasy French Fries that you get at terrible, healthless fast-food joints . . . or something similar.  So I dumped a whole bunch of oil in the pan, heated it up, and then proceeded to drop in a french fry covered in ice crystals. 

Bad.  Combination. 

It makes the oil spit.  Spatter.  Fly in tiny droplets all over the place.  It's horrible.  Very fortunately for me, nothing caught on fire, as did happen at Italian house last week (not il capo's fault).  Thing is, I didn't notice quite <em>how much</em> or <em>how far</em> it spit and spattered.  I'll be encountering oil for the next week!  Oh, and, although I've learned enough from burning myself way too many times, I did get a little spatter of hot oil on one of my hands.  Yeah.  Not pleasant.

So, my children, the moral of the story is, be careful when trying new things.  Use sense.  Heed the instructions on the package.  Don't jump into 9 foot boiling oil."

I meant to talk about how selfish a song it is.  Warning: I haven't proofread it, so it's exactly as it was two months ago.

This entry has quite a lot to say.  I just saw my house in NJ for probably the last time, after spending much longer in it than expected partly owing to a delayed closing date.  That house meant quite a lot to me, owing in large part to having grown up in it since I was six, and in another large part to the graves of my dearly beloved children being in the far reaches of the backyard.  It's been an eventful and painful more-than-a-week, and has brought up a few issues that seem utterly unrelated to a house or the loss of such.

Let's begin with the current topic on my mind, which is the comfort of sleeping in a bed.  I've never been much one for ergonomics, and certainly not one to be picky over mattresses.  When I was a kid I slept for a few months on a <em>coffee table</em> with perhaps just a thin blanket under me for padding, and I know that I've slept on the floor before with no problem.  Hence my confusion at being thoroughly not only uncomfortable, but in great pain when the furniture had been moved out and I began sleeping on the floor of the living room.  

I chose that spot specifically because of its padding.  The carpet is soft to walk on; it has an about one-half inch (maybe less) foam pad underneath it, and the carpet itself isn't exactly thing or hard-woven.  I pulled it to a corner, stacked up some decorative pillows that will probably be going to my apt and thus were still around, and lay out a comforter on the ground, using half of it as the underpart of my bed.  Half to sleep on, half to sleep under.  A good arrangement, no? 

The first night wasn't too bad.  It was after a few nights that the back pain really began to set in.  With all fairness, I had been doing a lot of heavy lifting, as I am the primary party doing that since no one else is around to take care of that.  I can lift a 30 lb. box with ease, provided I can get a good handle on it--a fact which I say merely as a basis of comparison--and most of our boxes had that as an easy minimum.  So that could have contributed to the back pain.  But I digress.  The point is, after a bit, my back started hurting, and before very long, that pain was almost unbearable.  I think only my exhaustion has caused me to sleep as well as I did. {Interestingly, I passed out from pure exhaustion--and a good bed under me--at the very end of that sentence.)  By the last night I was semi-conscious for half the time, and once actually <em>pushed a kitty off me</em> to roll onto my side. 

I was speaking with an adult friend--and by that I mean, someone who was an adult when I was a kid and hasn't since become a peer--and when I mentioned my confusion over not being able to sleep on the hard floor with no qualms she said, ""You're not as young as you used to be.""  I was still a little groggy from recently having woken up, and the unfiltered response that burst out of me was, ""That's horrible!""  She said, ""Welcome to my world."" 

It really is horrible, though.  I'm ""getting older"", in the sense of GETTING OLDER.  I'm not as young and spry as I used to be!  Agh!  Sleeping on a <em>floor</em> for a week has me complaining!


Now, you may have been given this long ranting if I'd been available for several, shorter rants, but I wasn't.  This reason is much more horrifying.  I have been WITHOUT INTERNET for the past more-than-a-week!  Yup.  Exactly.  Word.

"event","On this day one year ago, Trixy C-W died at approximately 6:15 AM.  The wound is still fresh; it feels not like so much time has passed.  A whole year.  He was with me more than half of my life.

I don't have a birthdate for him, and even his adoption date is fuzzy.  All I have is the date of his death.  So this morning I woke up in the early morning, lit candles, and did my best to reach out to him beyond the grave.  And, call me whatever you like, I could feel him reaching back.  Some events are just too improbable.  

I paid extra attention to my kitties, all of them--including Lucri, even though she isn't technically my daughter or even my niece.  All day I've given them special attention.  On a regular basis I try to pay great attention to my cats, but today I went beyond.  The Kitten mews at me, and I sit back down and give him more attention, even though I've been sitting and giving him attention for 20 minutes already and only mean to get up for about 90 seconds.  For example.  

My actions at first felt odd--like I was celebrating his death.  But no: today I celebrated Trixy's life.  With respect to the gravity of the anniversary, I dressed in full mourning, but all day I recalled fond memories of him and mentioned him to my friends, noting lovable quirks and stating that I have not for an instant regretted running up my first credit card bill in a vain attempt to save his life.  He was a different species, but he was my son.

Coming home, I was oddly cheerful, and continued giving lavish attention to every cat under my protection.  And it dawned on me.  Today is a reminder to cherish our loved ones, and in remembrance and celebration of Trixy's life, it is a time to give extra appreciation to every kitty-cat we know and love (and have contact with--two of my daughters live out of state).  So today is the day to give extra attention and affection to our furry beloved.  Time is limited, and it behooves us to appreciate fully the time we have now.  

Today, in honor and celebration of Trixy C-W's life, is KittyKat Appreciation Day.  

I love my son and daughters.  And I appreciate the time we have together and the love we share."

Also it [the Library] limits the number of items you can check out at one time, which makes perfect sense considering that this is a city, and that the city is Philly, but after my raising in an affluent county I'm spoiled and DON'T LIKE having my holds limited to five at a time.  I like having about a gillion holds at a time, and I want them to come in INSTANTLY (and yes, I realize how horrendously childish this entry is sounding and I'm not entirely okay with that but I need to vent) to my nearest of the 54 branches.  (See?  54 branches!  I should be singing its praises.  I just got a 1 Gig USB flash drive from them for 10 bucks, and am I not keeping up with the times, or was that a good price?)

In other news, Lucrezia has ear mites and a polyp.  Just my luck.  I babysit for one of the coolest cats EV-AH (outside of my gang) and she has to have a sickness start [on or before] the very day I get her.  (I noticed the excessive ear-scratching, but didn't know it was serious until she drew blood.)  I sure hope P. is okay with paying for the bills she's wracking up, but I am sure as hell going to get her good care.  Heck, the other day I crouched in the rain and cold wind for about half an hour, wearing light summer clothes, freezing while holding the umbrella over her carrier.  I even, IMO, slightly compromised my computer's security by installing the chat program that P. uses so I can try to get in contact with him ASAP, but since he's in a far-off country that his internet access is sketchy so I haven't been able to converse with him to discuss surgery.  I've even considered getting CareCredit again.  Damn; I hate having this bulky plastic collar on her, but she can't be scratching at her ear; it does nothing but press the polyp against the eardrum and won't make the itchiness go away.

I've been feeling a little social lately and missing my Tetazoo friends.  KC is the one who taught me what an ISO image is and how to use one.  (Imagine not knowing that!)  Call me.  I haven't been on Facebook lately (I don't like their recent and recently recent changes), but I think my phone number's on there (for friends).  IIRC (and I believe I do), Gordon F.'s my friend.  Teddy B. is, too.

For the record, I'm sleepy and woozy and distracted by having to give Lucri attention, so if this entry is a little . . . blirk . . . that's why.  But the main points, at least, are true.  I want my freakin' stuff from the library, Lucri's sick, and I want to talk to those from 3rd East.  Oh, and, I'm in between computers, which sucks.  A hell of a lot more's going on, but as I SUCK at keeping up with journals, and I don't think this one entry should be all that long, I'll leave that stuff out and hope I get back to adding the new stuff in, hopefully in regularized installments in this Livejournal."

"event","So, I just got a guitar.  It's pink (bleh), but was $15 and all I want to do is learn.  Now, usually I wouldn't go announcing this: I like to be able to show before I talk, and not have something happen like saying ""I'm going to play the guitar"" and then never getting to it like most of the people on Craigslist who are selling.  But I wanted to blog about something related to it. 

As far as fingernails are concerned, I prefer to have them shorter these days: it's more practical, particularly on the computer.  But since I came to have cats living with me, I had to let my nails grow longer so that I can give them good, satisfying scratchies--and I have to have both hands' nails long, because I have more than one cat.  This has made typing a bit more annoying, and slowed my speed, but it hasn't been so terribly bad and I've adapted. 

In the old days, when all three kids in my family were taking violin, I remember music teachers being militant about short nails.  That's what happens on a string instrument, at least the violin.  You've gotta have short nails, at least on your left hand. 

I was concerned that I might have to cut the nail on my right thumb for strumming, but asked at this store and found that I can use my nail to strum.  This saves on stuff.  No need to get callouses or picks.

Then I started trying to learn chords.  My guitar is 6-string, and I have to do a lot of holding down with the fingertips on my left hand.  And dammit, those nails are getting in the way!  I'm certain that other things are less than optimal with my technique, but I know that having a long nail makes the rest of my finger press against the string below and dampen it.

Problem. 

So here's the question:  Do I maintain long nails so that my kitties can get all sufficient scratchies whenever they want them, even if I'm already giving scratchies to another cat, or do I snip most of the nails on one hand so that I can better play?  Does some reasonable, acceptable compromise exist?  
(The kitties MUST have their scratchies.  This is not negotiable.  Says Cat.)

Oh, and:
Whine!  Complain!  My fingers aren't calloused and they hurt!!!  Oh, the self-pity!

P.S. - All I've got is the guitar here, and oh, how nice it would be to have a few basic accessories. If anyone's got a free case or strap . . ."

When I left CA, I knew it was a distinct possibility I'd never see Tigger again.  Sammy, though.  Sammy I expected to come back to.
God, he isn't even my cat and I still grieve.  Now so deeply as others, not so deeply as for others, but I grieve.  He was fantastic.  Wouldn't it be easier to be a hermit, never have a pet, never know anyone else or their children (meaning pets), so that the pain of loss needn't be an issue?

No, I suppose not.  Ultimately I think I still believe it's better to have loved and lost.  I wouldn't give up my years with Trixy; God no!  So there you have it.  

The thought still crosses my mind, though.  It would be easier not to love, because with love inevitably comes pain."

Oh, and my birth birthday was a few days ago, but my mother made way a much bigger fuss about it than I did.  She also made another damn tasty cake (and dinner), though, and Friday we went to <a href=""http://www.namastejuicebar.com"">Namaste</a> in New Brunswick where I met a really cool vegan guy named Drew--cool as in, he actually knows how to think, so far as I can tell from one conversation.  He can also whip up some excellent and freakishly healthy vegan food, wraps and shakes and juice mixes, among other things.  (I say ""freakishly"" in all the best humor.  He can rattle off a lot of facts about what's bad for the human body.)  My apartment finally has furniture, although I'm still neck-deep in boxes, and will be in the sleeping bag on the couch for one more night.  I am so drained from the past week.

"event","Happy birthday to me! . . .

Alright, the first thing you're going to say is, &quot;Today isn't your birthday.  You don't turn ## until next month.&quot;
<ol>Are ya one, 
Are ya two, 
Are ya three, 
Are ya four, 
Are ya five, 
Are ya six, 
Are ya seven, 
Are ya eight--
STOP!</ol>Now you're going to say, &quot;You've totally lost it.  Even <em>more</em> than usual.  You've got a double-digit age!&quot; 

Well, there's a book.  I never actually read this far in it, but my sister told me about how people give their ages according to when they got their swords.  In response to &quot;How old are you?&quot; a guy who got his sword six months ago would respond, &quot;I am not yet one year.&quot; 

People tend to forget or not even know what an important date the 28th of February is for me, because, one, legally the anniversary of the date on which I was physically born isn't, in fact, until next month; two, because since <em>this</em> date of birth happened only eight years ago, people haven't had time to learn it well; three, because some people are used to my birthday being not today; and four, I didn't even figure out what this date was for a while, and often forget to realize its importance while in conversation with people.  I have to reel off my legal birthday every couple of weeks for identification purposes, and places like the pharmacy don't give a damn about February 28th. 

I know you're on the edge of your seat, waiting with bated breath for me to stop jabbering and tell you what the hell is so important about today for me.  Well, did you recently notice a lot of people walking around with dark smudges on their foreheads?  What happens around this time of year, every year?  

Lent starts.  What do people do for Lent?

They give something up. 

At this point you say, &quot;Nione, you don't celebrate Lent.  Remember how you came back from California and said you were officially non-religious?  And you stopped following the rituals of religion many years ago?&quot; 

Yes, you're right.  But I was brought up a good little Catholic girl.  And Lent is a perfect excuse to give something up . . . when a parent says it's too much work and you can't do it for another three or so years.  Give up something like, hmm, eggs, dairy, and honey. 

Getting it?

Eight years ago, after having a cheese sandwich for lunch, I came home, went to get a snack, remembered it was lent, and decided that this was the perfect opportunity to 
<center>GO 
<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><strong>*~V-E-G-A-N~*</strong></span>.</center> 
Yes ladies and gentlemen, eight years ago today I went <a href=""http://www.veganoutreach.org/whyvegan/"">vegan</a>, in all manners of lifestyle.  I moved to <a href=""http://farmsanctuary.org/"">cruelty-free living</a>, and <strong>don't have a single regret.</strong>  
(OK, it took some time to phase out the leather and wool that I was already using, but I didn't want to waste what I'd already given the industry money for, or--morbid as this might seem--what the cows, etc. had unwittingly given to me as protection for my body.  Now, though, you can look at my shoes, and they'll tell you &quot;<font size=""-1"">ALL MAN MADE MATERIAL</font>.&quot;)

I don't really know when my vegetarian anniversary is, but I came to it in a similar fashion.  My sister and I both gave up meat for lent, but afterward went back to eating it.  I think it was around that August that I stared at a hamburger patty and saw the dead cow staring back, after which point I permanently gave up the eating of animal flesh. 

If 28 February wasn't actually the start of lent eight years ago, don't bother telling me.  The date itself doesn't have meaning until it is imbued with such, and when I took a calendar from that year and counted back forty days from Easter, the 28th is what I landed on.  For several years now I've held this as my anniversary, my second birthday, and if it's off my a few days I don't see an overwhelming point in changing it. 

The real point is, this is when I was in many senses <a href=""http://www.veganoutreach.org/guide/beingvegan.html"">reborn</a>.  I didn't become <a href=""http://www.farmsanctuary.org/issues/legislation/"">really active</a> in the <a href=""http://www.farmsanctuary.org/issues/factoryfarming/"">animal rights movement</a> until after I'd become vegan, and now, it's so much a part of me that it's second-nature to eschew anything that comes from an animal, besides love.  (And I do keep some feathers that Nasly, may he rest in peace, molted off naturally, and some cat hair from all my children including Trixy, may he rest in peacefulness.)  This was a very important day in my life, and a very fortunate one.  It was a new birth. 

On 11 March I became an independent human body, but on 28 February I became a fully independent spirit.

<em>Oh, and that parent who thought it would be too much work?  She realized it wasn't, and became vegan shortly thereafter.  In three years, at the point she'd told me she'd have enough time to help me go vegan, <strong>we both had a good hoot at how easy it actually was</strong>, and how neither of us could imagine living any other way.</em>"

"event","Yes, that last entry was rather vague, wasn't it?  In retrospect, I was about a ninth asleep when I wrote it.  

First: I figured out what I needed, at least with regards to the numbers.  (And I am using epsilon and hey; thanks.)  I took a nap, then did a simple, type-and-click search on the OEIS, and found a whole bunch of possibilities.

Now, to clarify: what I need(ed) is a sequence of not-too-large numbers that contains the numbers 14 and 5 next to each other, preferably in that order.  
I had been thinking, ""something like the numbers 8 and 13 in the Fibonacci sequence.""  But 14 and 5?  Not even, not prime, not divisible, separated by an absolute value of nine--I couldn't find a single connection.  After an embarrassingly long time (but before my nap!) it dawned on my sleepy brain that the digits of 14 add up to 5, but then, what would the next number in the sequence be?  (Interestingly, while writing this I've come up with a sequence of my own that could work, but I've already selected A052297, which works quite well for my purposes.)

Why the hell: I didn't originally use neatly connected numbers because I didn't originally realize their importance.  Look, I don't plan these things in advance, thus I don't realize when I really should be trying to plan in advance, and then I pass the point of no return and basically have to do something a little (I dread to say) fanwanky.  
If this last paragraph made sense to you, I congratulate you, because I'm back to being partially asleep.  (I just wrote ""partually asleem."")  Agh, RULES.

I looked at the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, and found <em>three</em> out of over a hundred that have both numbers: signature permutation of a Catalan automorphism, a(n) is the smallest number not of the form a(i) (1<=i<=n-1) or a(i)+a(n-l) (1<=i<=n-2), and a(0)=2, a(n)=5, a(n-2)^2 + a(n-1)(n-2).

The (hi)story:

So, I heard the credits to a certain movie, and actually thought that they might go well in a little story I'm writing (that happens to be in screenplay format, so I think about things like music).  Problem was, the music faded out halfway through the song and changed to another song, so I couldn't just grab the music from the movie.  The title wasn't obvious, so I googled some of the discernible lyrics and found the song.

Then a lot of blah blah blah happened with me listening to various songs and reading my script at the same time, but although a popular music song seemed most appropriate, I just don't KNOW them, so I was pretty much going hit-or-miss.  It occurred to me that if the credits from this movie were good, some others might be as well.  (I tend either to* distinctly either like or dislike credits music.)  

So I went online and looked for a list of the music used in movie credits.  I found a bunch of entries of people saying, ""I really liked the song in the credits from XYZ Movie; what was the name of it?"" but no general listing. 

The point:

Since so many people appear to like the song in the credits of a movie and later search for it, it seems like a general listing would be a good idea.  Someone either with too much time on his/her hands or with a violent need to procrastinate should try to come up with a general list.  People make lists like this all the time.  The demand is out there, but no one has provided an easily-googlable supply.

------
*
I put an asterisk in places where I write something that is stylistically incorrect, like splitting an infinitive.  It's a way of saying, ""I know this is a stylistic error, and I'm consciously breaking the rule.""
Of course, I use asterisks for other purposes as well.

"event","California had a very important animal rights initiative on the ballot this year, and, just like in Florida when I was 15, it <strong>PASSED!</strong>  This victory is so much huger, though.  In Florida it was a ban for gestation crates for pigs.  <a href=""http://farmsanctuary.org/mediacenter/2008/pr_prop2_victory.html"">In CA this year it was gestation crates, veal crates, AND battery cages.  And it PASSED!  </a>This is so incredibly immensely awesome.&nbsp; <lj-cut text=""Here's the article from Farm Sanctuary, or you can just click on the link and read it on the FS website!"">This evening, Farm Sanctuary, the nation&rsquo;s leading farm animal protection organization, celebrates a landmark victory for farm animals: the passage of Proposition 2 in California. The YES on Prop 2 campaign was run by Californians for Humane Farms, a coalition headed by Farm Sanctuary and the Humane Society of the United States. This law phases out some of the most restrictive confinement systems used by factory farms &ndash; gestation crates for breeding pigs, veal crates for calves and battery cages for egg laying hens &ndash; affecting 20 million farm animals in the state by simply granting them space to stand up, stretch their limbs, turn around and lie down comfortably. This evening, Farm Sanctuary&rsquo;s President and Co-Founder Gene Baur released a statement on the Prop 2 victory: <br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;The passage of Prop 2 in the country&rsquo;s largest agricultural state marks a monumental victory for farm animals. This campaign did an amazing job of raising public awareness about the cruel treatment farm animals endure at the hands of an industry that has consistently fought meaningful change for animals. Farm Sanctuary supporters and campaign volunteers have seen California voters respond with reason and compassion agreeing that all animals deserve humane treatment. Today marks a significant change in the way we view and treat farm animals and falls closer in line with public sentiments and values of compassion. We look forward to seeing these confinement systems phased out nationwide.&rdquo;<br /><br />The YES! on Prop 2 campaign has been the greatest undertaking on behalf of farm animals in U.S. history, raising enough public awareness and support to end three of the cruelest confinement systems with one ballot measure in spite of massive funding from the industry&ndash;backed opposition. Media outlets throughout the state and nationwide have covered Prop 2 and thousands of campaign volunteers have hit the streets consistently during the past several months to raise public awareness about farm animal protection issues. <br /><br />Farm Sanctuary was the second largest nonprofit contributor to the YES on Prop 2 campaign. Many Farm Sanctuary members showed their support through individual donations to Californians for Humane Farms, as well as hundreds of hours of volunteer time working on the YES! on Prop 2 campaign. <br /><br />Farm Sanctuary has been instrumental in setting the groundwork for many of the first victories on behalf of farm animals in California and nationwide, and was a lead sponsor of two previous successful ballot initiatives in Florida (ban on gestation crates) and Arizona (ban on gestation and veal crates): <br /><br />1995 - Farm Sanctuary helps pass a law in California, which prevents dragging, pushing, holding, or selling downed animals at stockyards and slaughterhouses. Other states follow California, passing similar laws. The Chino slaughterhouse investigation that resulted in the largest beef recall in U.S. history led to prosecution under this original California downer law. <br />2001 - Farm Sanctuary files a lawsuit with the USDA urging an end to the marketing of downed cattle for human consumption.<br /><br />2002 - Farm Sanctuary is a key sponsor of the first-ever ballot initiative to ban a cruel factory-farming practice in the U.S. This measure bans gestation crates in Florida.<br /><br />2003 - At Farm Sanctuary's urging, USDA promulgates a rule to prevent the slaughter of downed cattle for human food. Farm Sanctuary attorneys later negotiate settlement of this lawsuit against the USDA in response to the Agency's no downer rule.<br /><br />2004 - Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signs SB1520 into law, banning the force-feeding of ducks and geese to produce foie gras as well as the sale of the cruel product in California.<br /><br />2006 - Arizona Voters overwhelming vote Yes on Proposition 204 to ban the use of gestation crates for breeding pigs and veal crates for calves in the state. Farm Sanctuary is a leading backer of this campaign.<br /><br />2008 &ndash; Precedent-setting legal victory achieved when N.J. Supreme Court unanimously rules that factory farming practices cannot be considered &ldquo;humane&rdquo; simply because they are widely used.<br /><br />In addition to legislative and legal advocacy work for farm animals, Farm Sanctuary also operates the largest rescue and refuge network for farm animals in North America. The organization runs a 300 acre sanctuary in Orland, Calif. and a 175 acre sanctuary in Watkins Glen, N.Y. where more than 1,400 rescued farm animals receive round the clock rehabilitative care and lifelong refuge in optimal habitats. Some of the oldest farm animals in the United States reside at these sanctuaries where visitors can meet these animals, learn about their histories, as well as the adverse effects of factory farming, and witness their social bonds. <br /><br />More information on Farm Sanctuary&rsquo;s current efforts can be found at farmsanctuary.org. <br />Farm Sanctuary is the nation's leading farm animal protection organization. Since incorporating in 1986, Farm Sanctuary has worked to expose and stop cruel practices of the &quot;food animal&quot; industry through research and investigations, legal and institutional reforms, public awareness projects, youth education, and direct rescue and refuge efforts. Farm Sanctuary shelters in Watkins Glen, N.Y., and Orland, Calif., provide lifelong care for hundreds of rescued animals, who have become ambassadors for farm animals everywhere by educating visitors about the realities of factory farming.

"event","Chinese House had its kickoff tonight, or, more accurately, its first meeting and movie.  Hui, the new head of Chinese House, was nice enough to make a sign for my door that has not only my English name, but also my Chinese one--using simplified characters.  I'm guessing it's something to do with the computer not having a full range of the traditional characters.  

Anyway, the movie we watched was called (in English) <em>To Live</em>.  It was a <em>good movie</em>.  Not the type that's usually up my alley, and touchingly sad, but with a deep message and a deep truth.  It also had a sense of humor, which is hard to mix in, but they did it well.  Perhaps it particularly touched me because I just lost a son . . . and I know it touched me on a political level: basically, f*** Mao, Communism, and persecution of capitalists and intellectuals; these lead to BAD STUFF.  I'm not saying any of this very well, but I think I'm getting the meaning across.

Tomorrow Maison Francaise has its first meeting.  I can't be full members of Chinese or French Houses, but I still like to participate at least a little.

Gregory House TV Lounge doesn't have the enormous-screen TV anymore.
 . . . It has a high-resolution projector onto a screen.  Like at the movies.
I'm not one to find great TV-watching thingamajiggies impressive, but since other people do, I've been in the habit of being able to brag about GH's facilities.  And I thought the last three years were impressive(-sounding)!
(Van Pelt, I believe, still just has a regular enormous-screen TV, pshaw.)  

Now, am I working harder this semester or taking harder classes, or just not able to handle things as well?  I think it's one of the former two.  At any rate, I don't usually get the drinking-from-a-firehose impression on Day 3 of classes.
. . . Y'know, no one here gets the ""drinking from a firehose"" expression around here.  I always have to explain it.

And I leave with a question (one that I don't really expect anyone to have an answer to): 
Are there some things in life that you can just never get over?  Do some things just hang on no matter how many years pass over, and no matter how long goes on and you think you're over it?  Even for things that should be, rationally speaking, relatively trivial and logically easy to overcome?

Oh, and a final thought: I hate RealPlayer.

"event","Back at Penn.  It's my senior year, but when people ask me what year I am it seems more appropriate to say I'm a fourth-year, since for me senior does not equal last.  

I'm still in mourning.  The thing is, it doesn't seem like wearing black is accepted or even recognized as a sign of mourning in this century.  If I kept wearing black, people would mostly think I was a goth or something.  So I'm just wearing a black scarf or veil.  After all, I am a business student.  Unfortunately I can't wear just whatever I want anymore.  Still, it's annoying.  It used to be acceptable to wear black even for a year, maybe longer; people would know what it meant.

I'm going to try this thing called a short journal entry, meaning I won't spend an hour writing something for my lj.  The necessary stuff is in my room, but I still have some boxes and bags that need emptying, and some errands to run.  Never a dull moment."

"event","In one of the last <em>Doctor Who</em> episodes with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, he tells the Daleks that ""if there's one thing [he] can do, it's talk.  [He]'s got five billion languages and [they] haven't got one way of stopping [him]"".

5 billion languages.

5 <strong>BILLION</STRONG>.

That's a hell of a lot.  The Doctor is 900 years old, but that's still not enough to learn 5 billion languages in what we [Earth humans] would consider the conventional way, even if he's a really, really fast learner.  Sure, he's brilliant, but<em> five billion?</em>  That translates into, on average:
5,555,555.5555555555555555555555556 	  per year
   15,220.7001522070015220700152207   	  per day
      253.67833587011669203450025367834   per hour
        4.2279722645019448672416708946389 per minute
        0.0704662044083657477873611815773 per second

The only solution I can conceive of is that the TARDIS has a database of about five billion languages, and the Doctor is relying on that for all his languages.
OR maybe the Academy on Gallifrey has some kind of mega-fast-learning input system, like tape-learning or something, and the Time Lord brain can handle all that.  Of course, since the Doctor hasn't been at the Academy for a long time*, that means that he'd have to have learned the languages even faster.
OR maybe the Time Lord brain has some capacity for assimilating languages and learning them very rapidly.
OK, so maybe the first one wasn't the ONLY solution I can conceive of.  But it seems the most likely.

*Y'know, I <em>still</em> can't get ahold of those old <em>Doctor Who</em> episodes.  I guess they'd be on VHS, wouldn't they?  But still, I'm really having trouble finding the first 26 seasons/serials of the show.  But maybe that's for the best; I really don't have time for being watching so much TV.
At any rate, I don't know how long since the Doctor left the Academy.  All I know is that he entered at the age of 8, and by the age of 900 he had been travelling and fighting for some time.

But any good statistician would tell you how stupid it is to go by averages like that, anyway.

<font size=""+1"">Today marks <strong>seven years of veganism</strong> for me.  Seven years, not eating anything that comes from an animal.  Seven years of cruelty-free eating!  Cruelty-free eating, and cruelty-free <em>living</em>!</font>

I'm not sure what time of day it was that I made the decision; it was very on-the-spot, but all the same I knew it would be permanent.  It was for Lent, officially, but we all knew it would really be forever.  My mother and I had arranged that I could become vegan during my Junior year in high school, since she would have more time then for this ""big switch"" that would take ""so much work"" (that's sarcasm coming from me there, folks), but I realized it was Lent and, 'up, I was gonna be vegan.  Just like that.  A bit of an odd procedure, surely, but just as effective.  No weaning, not even ""one last non-vegan meal.""  Just, ""HEY, I'M <a href=""http://vegan.com/"">VEGAN</a> NOW!""

It's like a second birthday for me.  Nobody <a href=""http://docs.google.com/View?docID=dfmqd7kq_12j42gw4d6&revision=_latest"">gives me presents</a> or anything; I don't think other people recognize it as a second birthday the way I do, but this 'pop!' decision marked a profound turning point in my life, a turning onto a path that brought about remarkable changes in the past seven years.  I've <a href=""http://www.noveal.org/"">testified for the New Jersey Senate</a>; I've <a href=""http://www.farmsanctuary.org/mediacenter/pr_fl_2002.html"">helped change the Florida Constitution</a>, I've <a href=""http://www.farmsanctuary.org/get_involved/jobs/intern.html"">helped a vet performing surgery on the cancerous eye of a cow</a>!  I've met <a href=""http://www.arconference.org/"">masses of fantastic people</a>, and I've been privileged and honored to see others try out a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle as a result of having talked with me.  I <a href=""http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/search/search.php?q=vegan&num=10&start=0&output=xml_no_dtd&client=default_frontend&filter=0&site=default_collection&num=50&btnG=Search"">vote with my dollar</a>, and shifted my support to the <a href=""http://veganstore.com/"">vegan products market</a>, which has <a href=""http://www.vegnews.com/veggieawards_2006.html"">positively boomed</a> over the past decade.  No matter how else I stumble, no matter how else I fail, no matter what areas in which I feel pathetically deficient, this is one thing of which I can always be proud: I became <strong>vegan</strong>, of my own volition, when I was 13 years old, and have helped contribute to a great movement ever since then.  Hurrah!"

The spring semester started this past week.  Break was longer than usual, and I got a chance to see a few friends I haven't seen in quite a while, but several elements made it not actually that breakish.  Oh well.

I've been listening to Victor Hugo in the form of recorded books.  <em>Notre Dame de Paris</em> was nice and the library had it on CDs, but <em>Les Miserables</em> is only on audio cassette tapes, so I had to dig up an old Walkman.  But Victor Hugo is really an incredible writer.  I'd highly recommend <em>Notre Dame</em> (aka, <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>) to everybody.  Les Miz I'm not done with yet.

My classes look good but like a lot of work.  (Well, what am I expecting, elementary school?)

My iPod has been randomly starting to play French songs, so I have to keep it plugged in all the time or else when I go to use it it's out of battery.  Odd."

My only weak plea of excuse is that on the actual day I was heavily grieving and not paying much attention to the world, but still, I should have at least posted within the week.  But enough I & me.  

Kevin, my sincere apologies that this is over a month late.  I hope that you had a truly great day, and of course, that all the other days have gone, are going, and will go well also.

Kevin, coincidentally, is the one who taught me what an ISO image is.  So it's thanks to him that I wasn't at a complete loss when Knoppix talked about burning one.  (Also, as I have now, <em>finally</em>, installed Ubuntu on my Dell, I had to burn an ISO for that, too.)  He also introduced me to Nero, so I wasn't surprised by Knoppix's recommendation and knew what I was expecting (even though that part didn't come).  Actually, I've been thinking of Kevin a lot these past weeks (just kept forgetting the birthday, dammit) because ISOs and Nero are things that I associate very closely with him. 
(I don't know if this is a common thing or weird and specific to me, but I associate a lot of things referred to by nouns (i.e., places, things, ideas) very strongly with people.  For example, every single time that I use the word ""digress,"" without exception, I think of my sister.  No exaggeration.  And every time I think of an ISO, I think of Kevin.)
(The other way around, when I think of Kevin one phrase that comes to mind is ""mad brilliant."") 

Now, I wrote this entry when it was <em>only</em> less than a month late. (sarcasm)  It's just taken me forever to actually* post it.  So, at last, here it is: Happy birthday, Kevin.

"event","From <a href=""http://www.specbros.com/faq"">SpecBros's FAQ</a>:
<ul><ul><li>If you have professional quality tape from a major manufacturer and keep it in a dry environment that is comfortable for you, it should last at least ten years.<li>If tape is of a totally unknown brand or is miniaturized there is no real life expectancy: consider yourself lucky every time it still works! </ul></ul>Both my parents, by the time they married, had become very experienced in frugality.  I don't know what top-of-the-line was in 1980, but I highly doubt that these tapes I had found fell into that category.  Their brand is certainly no company that I've ever heard of.  If anyone wants to calculate inflation, I found a price tag, which listed each tape at 59&#162;.  At any rate, I'd much more expect that they fall under the category of ""totally unknown brand"" than ""professional quality ... from a major manufacturer.""

Yesterday [Friday 24], upon returning from RadioShack and cleaning the tape heads, I proceeded with my experiment of the headphones-to-mic cable.  The first annoying but minor problem was that I realized how incredibly short the cable was.  Twelve inches, in fact, although it feels a lot less than that.  My computer has to be <em>right next</em> to be boombox.  Fortunately I have a laptop, but whereas some of you civilized people may work at a desk or table, I tend to lounge on the couch (where I'm sleeping, for various reasons) and work with my laptop on my lap . . . or stomach, or folded legs, or . . . You get the idea.  So last night I fell to sleep with a boombox <em>and</em> a computer on top of me.  

But that's not really important.  I got my computer hooked up without too much trouble, selected a tape, and rewound it.  I listened to a bit, just to make sure it was working, then rewound it again and set my computer to recording.

No input.

Of course I blamed the connection, then retested the mic jack to make sure it was working right (it was) and tested the headphones jack on the boombox.

No output.

It was then that I opened up the tape deck to find that the tape . . . wasn't showing any tape.  On that last rewind it had yanked the end off one spool, so now everything--<em>everything</em>--was on one spool, with nothing at all sticking out where even tweezers could touch it.  I had the <em>tape</em>, but no access to it.

I didn't panic.  There are places, I thought, that know how to deal with this sort of thing.  I would have been astounded not to find any, even now in the age of CDs.  Going to the pile to pick out another tape, the first one I laid eyes on <em>did</em> have tape showing . . . outside of the tape casing.  Dismayed, I took another tape, carefully set it to the beginning of one side, and got it going.  The headphone-to-mic cable worked fine.d 

My mother was making dinner, and I showed her the tape I blamed myself for breaking.  She looked at it with interest, not appearing in the least surprised that it had broken.  ""Look, this has been used before,"" she told me, pointing to cross-outs on the label. ""It looks like college lectures.  This [tape] was used twice before making these recordings.  Don't feel bad about it breaking; these [tapes] are at <em>least</em> thirty years old.""

College lectures they were indeed indeed.  I've come across some of them while working with other tapes.  Not all of them have been used three times, but it's evident that they're all older than my brother, and most have been used multiple times, as is demonstrated by crossings-out and piled-up labels.  All of them are the same no-name brands, and all of them are old/low quality enough to be glued/welded together rather than held together by screws.

This last is important in terms of fixing the broken ones, but I'll get to that later.  The current point is that these tapes are very old, very used, and extremely fragile.  Since that first one broke, I wouldn't use Fast Forward or Rewind on any of them, at least not for the full distance of the tape, and certainly not for the ends.  For the ends, I've found, are particularly fragile, especially where the leader tape meets the audio tape.  That is where it has broken most often.  For this reason, my usual MO is to rewind/ff to close to the end--although usually this means pretty far from the end since I'm paranoid about overshooting--then Play to near the end of the opposite side--though again I'm often not sure where ""the end"" is, since these are home-made tapes that very often are in Cantonese--and then rewind it the rest of the way by hand.  I have now done far more hand-rewinding than I expected (or hoped) to do in a lifetime.

Now [Sunday 26, evening] I have quite a few broken tapes on my hands.  I kept count for a while--last I recorded it was one found broken and five broken during use, although that last was kind enough to wait until I have copied both sides of it--but now it's definitely more than six that need fixing.  Some of them got ""eaten""; some that got eaten I didn't notice for so long that the tape got quite scrunched and accordioned when most of it would have been unharmed if I'd caught it earlier. ( ::smacks self:: ) A couple of them have done one side just fine, but snapped or scrambled when I tried to record the other side.  One actually has both ends protruding, so I can fix it without needing to take the case apart.  Speaking of which . . . 

So, it's good that I remembered the wise instructions of DON'T PANIC when encountering broken priceless family audio tapes.  Some deep and extensive research (Wikipedia) on compact cassettes led to the discovery that not only are they simply repairable, but I can do it at home.  It would be easiest if the tapes were held together by 5 screws, as apparently most tapes today are (which I have indeed observed), but these don't have screws, which means I'm going to have to pry them apart, with a knife or screwdriver.  As such I won't be able to reuse the shells, so I had to find out where to buy empty ones, which is preferable to cannibalizing other tapes.  These proved difficult to find, although on a forum I found via Google, someone claimed that they used to be available just about everywhere.  Online, I found a grand total of TWO places that sell the cassette shells, and these with drastically different prices.  The extremely cheaper one (a dozen shells for $3, rather than $9.95) had an order minimum, though, so, alas, I was forced to buy more, which ended up being a tremendously large amount of stuff, which (including shipping) was about comparable to getting 12 shells and one roll of splicing tape from the other place.  My one less scrupulous decision was, instead of getting more than a lot of empty cases, I just got a lot of empty cases and a 24-piece tool set that was absolutely dirt cheap.  I think this is what would be jokingly called ""a guy thing"" to do: get something because it's on sale, and, you can never have enough tools. :-P

In the area of <em>video</em> tape recordings, I made my decision on method and bought the necessary equipment.  Tomorrow (er, later today [Sunday 27]) I embark on that exciting scene . . . in addition to continuing (and expanding) my exploits in the audio department.

Next up: One-to-One

"event","So, my most recent exploits in the technology/electronics area, since my harrowing run-ins with the Blue Screen of Death and subsequent interactions with Knoppix, have not been in the world of PC-computing but in dealing with vestiges of older technology and their conflict with the modern world.  I have a feeling that I'm a laggard in this regard, but I have finally pulled out all the old family VHS video tapes and audio cassettes with the intention of both preserving them and making them available to everyday use in this new era.  In other words, digitizing them.

I've done a little crude digitizing in the past, namely, when I came across an audio cassette that I wanted to listen to on my computer, I'd stick a microphone next to the boombox speaker--much like pointing a camcorder at a TV screen to capture video.  I've known that far better--and much more convenient--ways exist, and even known the most obvious solution: get a cable that goes from a headphone jack to a microphone jack.  But I never went forward with the process.

It actually wasn't until today, though, that I started looking at audio tapes again.  I spent the last few days sporadically researching VHS-to-{DVD} conversion.  I tried going from the VCR to my computer with my camcorder as an intermediary, but, wouldn't you know it, my wonderful, high-tech, tiny & sexy, 3 CCD camcorder won't take input into the AV jack.  So that nixed the hope that I would be able to do this without purchasing anything.

What I wanted to do was get the VHS onto my computer, then do what I like with it and then either burn it to DVD or save it onto one of my external hard drives.  It doesn't seem, though, like anyone wants to make a VCR-to-computer cable ready and available.  (If anyone happens to know where to get a cable that has the yellow, white and red on one end and USB on the other, I'd be happy to hear about it.)  

Today, procrastinating on further VHS research and other currently aggravating or otherwise meh-I-don't-feel-like-it tasks, I pulled out a bag of CDs, tapes, 3-1/2 floppy disks, and one <em>really</em> old-style tape (8 track, I think) that I had found among our store of VHS tapes.  Among these, I found some Spanish and Catullus Latin tapes, the old Suzuki violin tapes, far more religious music tapes than I would have expected . . . and some very old tapes labeled with such things as ""[my name] 1 mo.""

I didn't even know we had such things.  I listened to a little of one of them, one labeled in Chinese, and heard TKW [my father] speaking in Cantonese, what sounded like reading from one of those Chinese children's books we have.  Even though I hate hearing his voice, (and I couldn't understand more than a word here or there) I still listened for a while.  

Finding out how to transfer from cassette to computer proved much more complicated than I expected.  Lots of business about white & red plugs that you need some slightly sophisticated device to use. . . . My mother recently did some major house cleaning, and disposed of, recycled, or radically moved most things, particularly old things.  I'm not sure I would be able to find this stuff anyway, and as I wasn't sure if it was even around anymore, I didn't spend much time looking.  So I've got boomboxes, simple tape players, and walkmen, with nothing but headphone jacks.  Well, at the moment I'm more concerned about preserving the stuff, and hadn't I been thinking all along that all I needed was headphone-to-microphone?  So I did some coarse Googling, and found out--whaddya know?--they're the same type of jack/plug.  So all I needed was a cable with the same 1/8"" stereo plug on both ends.  As soon as my mother got home, we hopped over to RadioShack and I found one such cord with no problems.  I also got a head-cleaner and asked about analog-to-DV recorders, but didn't buy anything in that regard yet.

I started recording the tapes as soon as I got back, and it wasn't until then that I realized how desperately old and endangered these tapes are.  I've seen things online saying stuff about ""10 years"" . . .

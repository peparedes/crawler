"event","Well so much since the last time I wrote.. Wow where to begin.  Well we had gone to dinner at j and a's and everything was good till I got slammed with the stuff going on between jon and I.  About needing to know things and blah blah blah.. Well I felt I was being attacked even though they said i was not.. jon was ready to move and pretty much give up on the friendship.  Those are two things I don't want.. I mean I already have to pretend at work he does not live with me anymore.. I have to think about everything I say so not to let it slip.. That was a very hard night for me.. I can't lose him as my friend and i won't but I also don't want him not to talk to me and keep things from me.. Then of course j and A are getting tired of dealing with the crap and talked about letting jon live there for awhile.. But he came home with me.. But i found out that he was going to be watching their house for the weekend while they went away for their anniversary.  So Friday when i got home he was gone which I knew he would be.  He left me somethings on the board and talked to me a little online.  Saying he loved me and will love me.  I just need to work on it.. So he had me come over and bring him some things.. He was online and offline.  I got online at home and talked to him some.  He also called a few times and had me bring him some movies and food.. The whole weekend I of course wondered what he was doing, if someone was there, who he was talking to.. He asked me if I had been emailing him under other emails which I have not. The only other one i have is tj and I have not emailed from it in awhile. Also during the weekend pepe my cat was not doing well.. I knew he was on his way out to pet heaven.. Well jon came back monday night and things were ok. Tuesday I went to work and we talked online.  He told me he got approved for a phone through sprint.  How can he get approved for sprint but nothing else.  I asked if someone else helped him and he got a little upset over that.. Thought maybe ns helped him.. He gave me the numbers to make it a number game but not good at them.. LOL  His phone should be there today.  he will be able to text again.. Don't like that.. WEll while I was talking to him he told me pepe would not eat and was not moving so i was upset over that.. So had to go by store on way home.. When i got home pepe was still breathing.. But when he moved he cried.. So i got upset when i heard that.. I called my sister and my mom was there and she said tell tammy she has to go to work jon can kill him.. That upset me and hurt me.. So i told teresa to call me back.. Jon and i decided it was time to help pepe go so he would not be hurting.. i held him a little then put him back on the floor.. We ate dinner.  then after dinner jon crushed up some of his pills and mixed with water and put in a dropper.. I went and got pepe and opened his mouth so jon could give it to him.. of course after we got my sister's blessing. So after we gave it to him I sat down with him and just held him and kept him calm till he passed. He passed peacefully and without paid and knowing i loved him and was there.. His eyes would not close which was hard.. We called my sister and told her he was gone. She told us to wait so my mom could leave.  We found a shoe box and put him in it with a towel and a ball.. jon wrote nice stuff on the top.. We went to my sister's and teresa and samantha wanted to see him.. Then we put him in the ground said a few words then covered him up.. That was hard to do but he is not suffering anymore or in pain.. Otherwise things are ok. Jon is getting ready to go to DC next week.  Will be gone 6 days but making 1000.00.  I hope he is not lying about it because i am putting alot of trust in him.. Well money still is tight but go figure.. Well will keep you posted.. RIP pepe 05/26/09 9:30pm"

"event","Just once I want to know why people think I am stupid. Perfect example is Jon thinks I am stupid.. He tells me he is on the phone with one person (ie dave, grandmother, etc...) but I am sure he is on the phone with the whore s. I could be wrong but I am sure I am not.. Just like I know there are some major emails going between the two of them.. I just want him to be honest with me.. I know I should not be worried about it.. She is an ugly adulterous whore. I know that is mean but I do not like her at all.. And if they do get together I am definitely going to be pushed way back.. I don't even think it is right that he has to be FWBs with her.. He tells me he does not want to ruin friendships but yet he will do sexual stuff with her.. That phone is really getting on my nerves.. IF he is not on his phone he is on the computer and vice versa.. I can't get into his phone and I can't get into his email.. I need to figure out the password or something.. He won't talk to me because he says I am being a brat. I knew something was not right with him this morning.. Now I know.. He had a death in his family and other things he said if I was not being a brat he would talk to me.. I am sure he is going to take k out for his birthday or something.. I just know the rent check better not bounce.. I don't like when he is home because I don't know who or what he is doing.. But nothing I can do.. Seems he only tells me what he thinks I want to hear.. I know I have screwed up and broke my trust level with him but I need to rebuild it.. I don't like feeling he has to talk to others and not me.. Now he said I was posting on CL but it was not me it was him.. See this is what I am talking about.. Fine he is on the DL about and bi curious but don't treat me like I am an idiot.. I have no problem with him being bicurious but don't hide it.. I feel I am better when he wants to be with a guy instead of a girl.. Because then I can't try to figure out what is wrong with me.. I just don't know what to think or do anymore.. I am starting to doubt him more and more.. I don't like doubting him but he treats me like I am stupid and won't be straight with me.. will let you know..&nbsp;"

"event","Well so far everything has been going ok if I will stop getting myself in trouble...  I have been getting along with K... Jon and I have been getting along except when I assume.. Last night I assumed at something K said... So I left a note on the car and of course that was not a good idea because I got a lecture this morning.... I am just afraid that he does not want to spend anytime with me... And I am afraid that when they do move out (which I know will happen but not too soon..I hope) that things will change and I will not get to see him that much.. He works alot of hours... But for some reason K keeps upsetting him and Jon does not want to talk about it... He tells me to ask K and he tells me to leave it alone... I just don't want the friendship to change.... I think my insecurity is trying to come up again... I don't like to upset jon or make him mad.. I don't understand why my family can't trust me... Jon is not using me.. I am a good judge of character... I just want everything like it used to be... I want our fun and play back plus other things... heehee  But I Have to stop assuming.. If I go back to the old tammy that jon changed he is not going to be happy with me... I do still want some of his positive words again... He knows how much they mean to me... MH called and wanted to know about his money... I had my second interview with connextions today.. It went well... I just have to decide if convergys is where I want to stay if I get the other two positions.. Mary G said that she wants to work with me on interviewing skills because she does not understand why I can't land these jobs because I have so much experience and knowledge.. Mark said that I don't talk about the job I am interviewing for and that I need to tell them what I know and what I have done... It is nice because connextions pays weekly and I have the chance for advancement but of course the hours is going to be crazy not having any seniority.. IT would be nice if I could get into management... Have to go to school tomorrow and jon has to go to west palm beach... My friend from Tennessee said he is going to be in town and is going to give me money but we will see if that happens... I am not going to because when I do it never happens... Well guess this is enough for now... Till tomorrow..."

"event","Well talk to Jon last night.. He was not mad at K or I he was mad at the world... He is starting to work at Mcdonald's part time which I am not too excited abt because there is time taken away.  Even though he is living with me... Also they are already talking about moving out.. Jon knew I was crying and wanted to know why.  He does not let me go until I tell him... I am glad he knows me like he does... I do want them to stay for awhile... I like the company and K and I are getting along pretty well... He did read my email and said we would discuss part two later.... HIs later means so many different things....LOL   So we shall see when that is going to happen... I do still want some one on one time where we can go do something and talk like we used to.. Well today is Monday... I start back to UCF this week... Yippee.... I am really starting to hate convergys.  I applied for about 5 different jobs online.. Hopefully something will give because I need to get into my field... I changed my hair and everyone seemed to like it except one or two people did not.. I know even though Jon is living with me I still miss our talks during the day.. I still have that slight fear about being replaced but I don't know why?  Jon has even said that before... I am starting to become the old negative Tammy that jon changed for the better and dislikes... When he came home we did talk some... He asked why I look upset but I did not go into it because I don't even know..(well maybe??) I know I am in some severe pain and don't know why and that scares me.. I am glad I go to the dr on Friday..I am really hoping that jon helps me on a few things like he has always said he would.. When him and i was in the kitchen he was playing with me and I miss that... I was glad that was happening... Now just to get the positive words and etc.... I wonder if I asked him to do something for me if he would or would I get let down... Hmmm I wonder... I am starting to feel like he is telling K stuff and not me.. He talks to K during the day but what about me?  I don't know.. I know I can tell him anything or show him anything and not be embarrassed as I know and hope he can with me... Well hopefully I will get some time with him soon.. He knows me and knows me very well just like I know him very well... Well we shall see what transpires from here..."

"event","WEll things have been going well...  At least I thought they were.. Friday night was not good because people were making things up abt jon and I.  It is nice having company... I did get to meet jon's trainee and I wonder about her... Well yesterday was time for k and jon to help the pack rat (me) clean my room... Things were going good except when K found stuff he would read it.. I am not embarrassed but I don't want jon to pull away thinking my feelings are back.. So we were cleaning and everything is looking really good... WE stopped to eat some lunch and watch a movie... I kinda got upset because the way K was playing with him and I can't.. Of course jon knew this because he knows me... I cried a little because of some stuff in my head.. Then I ordered some pizza for dinner... Jon's attitude kinda changed and I asked if he was mad... He said yeah and he did not want to talk about it.. I asked if I did something and he said he did not want to talk to me right now... When he wants to be left alone you leave him alone.. But that bothers and concerns me.. Makes me think he is replacing me with either S or J (even though he has not known her long...)  But if that was the case I think he would tell me... I wonder about her and jon... So later that night he came in and said that the dogs are suppose to be on the floor and they rule my life so at least he is talking to me.. So if it was me then he would not be talking to me... Him and I have an agreement with our friendship that if I do something to make him mad or upset him he is to tell me... That is why him and I are so close and we have our open and honest communication... So he said he was leaving and to have a good night I assumed and asked him if he was coming back and he said did I say that? So of course I was jumping to conclusions.. my bad.. AS he was leaving he spoke to K and asked if mr almighty was going to respond or if he cared.. Then he said well I hope you and your friend tammy have fun since you already have been.. I asked K what that was about he said I did nothing wrong and to let him have his temper tantrum and not to dwell on it...  So I went to bed of course could not sleep well at all.. Things running through my head and I know he is upset/mad... He did come in after midnight but did not speak... I wonder who he called or whatever.. I don't want anything to be ruined and I enjoy them being there and the company.  I want things between jon and I to get back to normal... Plus I really want to ask him something hypothetical to see what his answer is but I am afraid to get hurt...  Dean comes back from vacation tomorrow... WEll we will see how things go from now... till later..."

"event","Well jon was out late with his team at work.. His paycheck is still messed up which I know is ticking him off... K and I went to target and got some food... We actually have been getting along lately which has been nice.. I still can't tell when he is playing or what.... Today I was off.. Got the money from the friend who wrote me the check... Took that to the bank, went to target and got my perscription and went and got my hair done.. I did a little different color and a different hair style.. It looks good.. Even K and Jon said it did not look bad.. Figured I needed a change... Seems certain people are taking things I have said and getting me in trouble as usual.. Especially S, since she does not like me and I have no clue why... Well I sorta do but won't go there... So jon was mad because people are calling him and starting crap all over again which upsets me because Jon should know me better than that.. I think if I said anything I would have told him... I know better than to lie to him... He does not like it because I am going back to my old self that I was doing so good to get away from... Plus I have been slipping into negativity again... I don't want to mess things up or make them want to leave any sooner... I like the company even though they are taking over my house... I just want to feel like we used to and right now I don't know i feel like I am doing nothing right or something... K and I got along again today and that was nice... We brought his fish over here and they are cool.. Went and bought food for dinner from money i had left after buying stuff for school... Of course jon thinks he will hear about it and I don't understand that at all... I just want everything to be fine and all of us to get along and jon and I to be like we used to and it scares me that is not going to happen... I don't like when he is upset with me because that upsets and hurts me... I just want some time with him.  Just him and i... Maybe i can get him to go play putt putt with me just so I can know that we are fine.. He did say love earlier today and I like when he says and does stuff like that... Well we shall see how things progress or transpire... Till tomorrow..."

"event","Well I finally got power back yesterday... I am so glad... It was getting very hot and I was not sleeping well at all... JOn and K is staying with me and things are ok at times but other times they are not.. I think JOn is different around K but he says he is not... My mom threatened to put my niece on her life ins instead of myself since she thinks that Jon is using me and not telling me the truth and does not care about me.. So I have to stop being around him.. I told her she needs to give me the benefit of the doubt and trust my judgement... I am not stupid... But he does because he does not want to see me go back to being negative like I used to be.. He does not like when I am like that... I am glad he is here and K is ok as well but i still want some one on one time.. Today he has called and K has talked to him everytime.. I sent him a message but got nothing back but yet he can call K... I guess my feeling is right... The guys will always be first before me.. Even though jon keeps saying he only trusts K and I... I did find out from K that the detroit trip was personal... I kinda figured so why would he lie to me or not tell me the total truth... R is going to give me the cash tomorrow... So my acct will be ok again I hope... Now just to get the other acct under control... I got my stuff for UCF today.. School starts back this coming week.. Also my hrs are better next week but not where I would like them to be... i just want to feel comfortable with everything and stop feeling like I am on a roller coaster... Sometimes I think if it was not for jon knowing me so well that I may have driven myself crazy by now... Him keeping me positive is important... Because I think I would be crazy right now if it was not for jon.. I just want him and I to have some one on one time...  I wish I could get enough nerve to ask him one thing I think about hypothetically  but I can't seem to because I am afraid my worst fear would be realized... I am glad he is here... I just want to know that he does appreciate and cares and does really love me.. He is my best friend and I love and care about him and nothing is going to change that.... Time will tell..."

"event","Well this has been an interesting few days.. A friend helped me with money and his check bounced so now my acct is majorly in the negative.. So I am freaking about what I am going to do to pay my bills and buy food.... Then Friday Hurricane charley came through.. K and J started moving in and they stayed with me during the hurricane.. We lost power at 930pm and a tree almost came through my sliding glass door but my porch saved it so now I have a tree house...LOL I am just glad I did not have to go through it alone... We are still without power as of this morning.. I went to my sister's yesterday for my niece's birthday party and took a shower there.. Then my mom started her crap so I left and came home.. Jon and i kinda got into it over a few things but we talked it out.. Today I am at work.. Yippee... Still worried about everything and now my refrigerator has to be cleaned out which really stinks... So I really at this point don't know what I am going to do.. Jon tells me to relax but that is hard especially right now.... But he would not let me drown so I trust him.. He said we will figure stuff out as it comes.. I really trust him.. I dont' like getting upset with him and I know he does not like to get upset with me.. so hopefully things will get better... We shall see.. But right now I feel like I am downward spiralling and dont know what I am going to do...  We shall see..."

"event","WEll still have not talked to Jon and that scares me... He has had his boss with him the last couple of days so he has not called me.. Last night I woke him up and he told me to stop probing...  He is kinda going back to the way he was at this time last year... I sent him an email but I probably won't get a response I never do lately... Well today I had to work 915 to 615.. I really hate those hrs... We have a hurricane heading this way... I txt messaged jon but he said he is in training... So another day of not talking to him... So the day was very busy which is good but also bad... So finished up the day and went home... Checked the accts and my acct was totally negative because the check that was given to me to help me was returned not paid... So now I am really freaking... I called my sister and of course her stupid husband would not let her help me even if she could... I know my mom can't help.. So I called Jon and left him a voicemail.. go figure... Then I sent him a txt message hoping my vm did not come off wrong... Well he finally called me and I told him what was going on.. He told me not to worry because we would figure something out.. I trust him with my life and don't doubt him.. So we talked and he will probably be living here next week with K... I am happy about him but still some issues with K... He put me on hold and when he came back his whole attitude changed.. I don't understand why.. I need to ask him or am I reading too much into it.. He said he has not really talked to anyone this week...  But I wonder especially if he has talked to the other person I keep thinking he is replacing me with.. But I am assuming again.. I just want to make sure everything is ok with us and that we still get some him and me time... I just want what we used to have with emails and IMs and everything especially our fun and play and other things...  I know he would never keep anything from me.. Then to top the night off MH called asking about money jon owes him.. I told him don't even start on me about that because I feel like my life is downward sprialing.. Well we shall see if I get to talk to jon again..."

I txt messaged jon and he called me later and told me to relax and not to worry, he is not mad at me and everything is fine because his boss was riding with him... So did not hear from him all day like I have been which I like.. So when I got home I txt messaged him and did not hear anything.. He called me to tell me about his phone but i had gotten the email.. So I asked him what was wrong and he said he was not talking.. That scares me because he is near the breaking point when he says that.. He txt messaged me to let me know he was going to bed... So I heard nothing else... Today I had to work a crappy 10 to 7pm.. Yuck.. Txt messaged jon but did not hear anything till he asked what time I worked till... and he said they were coming over to clean after work... Plus his boss was riding with him.. So another day of not talking to him which really worries me... Well I txt messaged him to see how his day was and he said he had a great day and talk later.. I hate that because his later could mean anything... So I was hoping they would be there so I could talk to him but they are not and I have not heard from him.. I am really worried about him and what is going on... It is not like him to keep stuff to himself... I sent him an email and hope he calls... Something had to come up for him not to be here cleaning since I guess they will be moving in this weekend... My sister got into a car accident yesterday but she is ok.. She seems to think that ever since I met jon I have gotten myself in a hole because of him and that I will never see any money to help me get out... I can't wait till I can make her eat her words... It is hard for me not to message him but I don't want to upset him.. Well hopefully since he knows me so well he knows not talking to him is killing me... WEl I Just want him to call me.. I hope he does... Well till later or tomorrow.."

Night... That had nothing to do with what I sent at least I don't think so.. Well I start my screwed up schedule this week.. I am not looking forward to it.. I have to work till 730 today but I got out early because I could not do it and next week is no better... I really hate charter.. Well txt messaged jon this morning and he said he was going to put some cash in the bank... I told him to call me on my lunch... Got to work and they were in queue... Go figure.. But my seat was saved... So at break time went to the store... Called the bank and everything good there and then called the payday place and they cashed the check.. which I hope my rent check gets there before it does...So went back to work.. It finally slowed down which was good... I took a late for leaving early yesterday...But needed to... WEll at lunch I txt messaged Jon and he called me.. So we talked.. He said he got my back and I know he does.. He was not having a good day and was going to have a meeting with his boss tonight.. I hope they fix his check for him he could really use it... So he had to go and we went back to work.. OF course M was trying to get ahold of me about the money from Jon so I txt messaged him and he called me and told what to say to M... So on my last break I went and talked to M and dealt with that.. I then left early.. Came home and took out the dogs and fed them and ate... Jon called me and he is stressed which I understand because like he told me when I am stressed he is stressed... I do feel for him and what he is going through.. I just deal with it in my own way not to add to him... His ex is being so vindictive about his son and everything.. They are still giving him and k hell about the house and everything.. This is really getting to jon and I can tell...I am here for him no matter what he needs.. He just has to let me in... So he said he would talk to me later and they would probably be here when I got off tomorrow cleaning... I hope he knows I am with him and I do care about everything he is going through... We have helped each other and I don't want that to stop now... I just want to be able to hold him back from the edge... Without him in my life I really don't know where I would be... His positive and caring words as well as actions.. Yeah I would like another of those type emails but I am sure in due time.. Plus I love the hugs and everything.. But I am here for him all the way and he knows that or better know that.. Till tomorrow..."

"event","WEll Jon called me last night totally pissed.. seem J talked bad abt me and that totally upset jon... Everyone tries to tell me jon does not care but I beg to differ after that.. Well today I had to work 845 to 545 but jon called to say I had an emergency so I could get out early so we could have lasgna and clean.. Because him and K will be living with me soon... Jon could tell something was wrong as he always does which is not a bad thing most of the time.. But I told him we needed some rules and K has an interview on Tuesday...Jon thought I was going to ask abt his checks so he told me he was going to see if he can get them fixed before he cashes them... But I was not even going there.. So I went to the store and got the lasgna stuff.. Jon paid for the stuff.. can't wait to tell my sister that... Came back and put the stuff in the house and then took the dogs out quickly... When I was in the kitchen jon gave me a hug and said thanks for letting us stay here... I needed that hug to let me know i am still appreciated....:-/ So we ate and then cleaned some more.. I took the dogs out.. as they were wrapping up to go Jon gave me a hug and held me which really made me feel good... I am just afraid with K living with us that I will get kicked to the curb or never get time with Jon.. I told jon this but he told me why would I think that... Because I still think K is more important some times...The apartment looks real good.. No one is going to believe it.. I do want jon and I to sit down and talk a little more without K... I am hoping he gets his stuff fixed so we can at least take care of the acct... I will call the bank and sarah tomorrow... I need more time.. I could really use one of jon's positive emails... I just still want time with him and to feel like I matter and I am important because many tell me I am not... I can't wait till I can prove all of them totally wrong about jon.. Yeah I want our fun and play back and things back to normal but one thing at a time.. There is even some other things I still want.. But we will see... I hope he will call me later if not at least call me this week... I like talking to him.. Well till tomorrow."

K was not speaking to him because Jon accidently went off on him because he was so angry.. His job lied to him yet again... And they still want him and K out of the house... So we talked about all that and he wanted to end it all but I kept him away from that idea.. Well this morning my sister called me because her idiotic husband wants her name off my bank acct.. I was very pissed.. I am really starting to hate him and I don't usually hate people... Well my sister said it is temporary.. Maybe I will put jon on.... Well then Jon called me he was meeting with someone about some money but that did not pan out.... He called me later and said him and K may come over and we would start cleaning my apt... They may be moving in with me for a little bit.. I have no issues with jon living there but K is another story.. There will be rules put down... This is my house so I can do what I want...LOL WEll did not hear from him so I called but he states he was sleeping..(hmm I wonder)  So he said he would call me back later... So he called me when he was on his way home from getting something to eat... Where did he get the money and is there money going into the bank acct soon I hope... Well he was totally pissed because J had been spreading lies abt jon and K being ungrateful and other things while visiting for a wedding... Then Ja told him that J said that he is responsible enough he could go stay with his bitch friend (me) and I guess it was brought up that they thought J liked me and he said no I was a piece of shit.. :-(  Well Jon did not like that at all.. Not only was he pissed about what was said abt him but also that he would talk about his best friend that way... I said well J owes me some money so I better get it or Jon said we will sue... Jon said the next week is going to be interesting... He was very upset abt it... And i understand... Well he said he would call me when he calmed down.. He said love and hugs... bye... Still have not heard from him but he has always kept his word so why would he stop now.. I know not to bring up money though with him in this kind of mood.. I just hope either the check comes in the mail (is there one?)  or that he puts some money in the bank so the bank does not close the acct....He tells me to relax but it is hard... We shall see what happens.. Till tomorrow..."

"event","Well Jon called me last night... It is nice to talk to him again.. Things seem to be getting back to normal or so it seems.. Today is my day off... I sent him a txt message hoping his day is better.. He said Gee, Thanks... So I got my bad feeling so I txt messaged him and asked if everything was ok.. He called me and said everything is fine... He went home for lunch and fell asleep.. He said he would be over shortly... So got dressed for my interview.. He called again and said to meet him outside... I asked him abt the money again and he asked me to promise not to bring it up again... So then we talked about me wanting him to come back and I said yeah... He said he has to bring his boyfriend with him...LOL  He knows i hate when he says that because he is not gay... He just likes to aggravate me... He said that K and I will become the best of friends again... I said there will be some rules set and he said why?  I said I still have trust issues with him and so should you.. He said I have let it all go and so should you... I just don't trust him with the money situation.. I still wonder if he is putting his paycheck in K's acct but why would he knowing he has his own acct and it is in jeopardy... He wanted to shake my hand so I gave it to him and he squeezed it so hard that my ring cut into it... He said you look like you want to cry.. Did I say something to upset you?  I said no and he said you are lying.. Remember I can read you.. Which he can... So I finally got him to believe me even though there are a couple of things that concern or bother me but was not going to go into it right then... So I left for my interview.. He called my phone but I did not hear it so he left me a really nice voice message and I definitely needed that... Just wish he would of ended it with that he loved me like he does sometimes... So got lost going to my interview.. The interview went well... So called him and told him.. Thanked him for the message and he said no prob... So then that was it... I went home and took the dogs out and went to target to get dog food and got me some taco bell... He called me and said he will call me later, don't ask questions just go with it.. Don't text message or assume or anything you normally do.. I will talk to you tonight.. I said can I ask one thing and he said yeah... I said did I do anything?  He said no, if you did you would definitely know.. So I felt better after that... So he said he would talk to me later before I wake up in the morning.. he said it could be in 10 mins or hrs from now but he will call me.. I may have to come get him out of jail... so he joked with me a little and then said he had to go...To this point I have not heard from him.. A neighbor is having relationship problems so needed me to drive him somewhere.. His girlfriend has no trust level with him.. I am so glad I am not in a relationship and I have jon and our trust level... Well guess I wrote enough for now... I really hope I hear from Jon soon... Till later or tomorrow..."

"event","Well did not hear any more from Jon last night but did not think I would because he was so tired that his eyes were blood shot... So I hope he got some much needed sleep.. I know he has not been sleeping since all this crap going on.. WEll today I had to go in at 10 am which really sucked... And next week they have my schedule totally screwed up as well... I txt messaged Jon to say I hoped he had a good day and hope he got some sleep... He said thanks and he went to sleep at 830pm.. So I told him that was good but I was just going into work.. So he called me and asked why?  So I told him they screwed up my schedule.  I asked him abt his checks and he said he would get them and bring them to me... So we talked and today he finds out if he will be staying here or not.. I guess I will be getting K as well but there will be some rules laid on that one... K is my friend but i still have some trust issues like JOn should have.. But nothing I can do on that one... Well worked till 2pm and then went to the mall and was there for a little while.. Jon called and we talked.. He was not having a good day.. He talked to his dad abt helping him and they were telling him today was the day... He went and saw A and S at the office and they talked abt me and stuff... I asked what he was doing after work but they had a company outing ( I wonder???... LOL)  He wanted to know why because he could read my words.. I said so he could bring me his checks.. But of course never got an answer.. So he had to go back to work.. So I went and got G and my niece a birthday card and headed home.. Took the dogs out and checked my machine and there was a message on there for Jon abt their concert so I called and told him.. His day was no better so he was sitting in a park and now was headed back to the office.. I did not ask abt the check again because did not want to upset him.. I don't doubt him but I would like to get something in the bank soon.. Especially since the payday advance is due tomorrow.. I know he tells me to relax and I trust him but I just don't want bad standing with the bank or anything and he knows that and I know he does too.. I hope he brings me the checks tomorrow so I can put them in the bank in the morning... Why am I not seeing the checks???  Where are they????  Guess I will have to wait.. I trust him and don't doubt him.  HOwever I want to get things taken care of so that is off my and his shoulders... Well we shall see.. Till tomorrow..."

"event","Well Jon called me last night when he got home... I was glad because I was worried... He told me that K and J was in Michigan but for a wedding.. Him and K may need some where to stay.. I have no issues with Jon staying here but there would have to be ground rules when it comes to K... I still have trust issues with him (K)... Jon told me the check was being mailed to me from tally and he would pick up his check today and bring it to me so I can deposit it... As long as that happens that will kill alot of doubt that people have stuck in my head... Well this morning he called me to see when I was going to lunch.. So I told him and he said ok I will come meet you.. That shocked me but I was happy about it... So I went to lunch and he came and picked me up and we went and got something to eat (he paid...LOL) :-) I helped him look over the map to see where his area is... I am glad it is here and not some where else close to someone else... Then we came back and he dropped me off and he went to work... So the day was not bad.. Not as busy as the beginning of the week.. They totall screwed me next week on my schedule.. I am not happy about that... Well Jon called in the afternoon and asked when I got off so I told him and he said ok I will come over and take my break then.. Will be there at 3:30 and if you are not you are in trouble...LOL   So I finished my day.. Headed home.. Just as I walked out the door with the dogs he pulled up.. It was nice and starting to feel like old times and things were getting back to normal... So we talked for awhile and then he had to go back to work.. He looked really tired... I just still think there are some things he is not totally being straight with me about... But why would he do that... He trusts me like I trust him and we have open and honest communication where we would not judge one another so why would he not be straight with me.. I just need to be bold like he wants me to be and ask him... But I don't want him upset with me either.. I don't know.. He tells me to stop worrying and relax but sometimes that is hard... But I am trying.. He said I have to let him take control sometimes and give up my bitchiness...LOL  Well went to go pay my electric bill but it is done via EFT so I am freaking it will clear before money goes in the bank... I hope not... He called me and told me it would be ok I need to stop freaking out and relax.. I don't know what I would do without him... He also pointed out how much he really knows me... It is scary but I really don't think it is a bad thing... I would not mind him living here again... It was nice before.. But not getting my hopes up because then I get hurt.. I hope tomorrow happens to and it pulls through... Well guess I will have to wait and see... I just hope things with Jon and I are getting back to normal and continue to... Especially our fun and play and a few other things....LOL  well gotta go for now..."

"event","Well Jon called last night.. I was glad of that I was kinda getting upset because usually he talks to me more but since K and other people are with him I get kicked to the curb... He seemed happy and he gave me some information abt one of our situations but he would not talk about a txt msg that he sent that he said he would tell me later.. That was not later.. Oh well hopefully when he gets back.. So he should be landing soon I would think.. I am sure he has a ride from the airport or I would have already heard something... I just hope he will give me one day this weekend since I have not got to spend much time with him... Plus I really think we need to talk... I got another txt message tonight and this one kinda scared me because it said ""Jon is not being straight with you.  He is laughing behind your back because you are buying every untruth.. You need to ask him for the truth...""  Why would this be sent to me?  What do they know that I don't?  I would hope nothing.. JOn and I have a trust level like no other that we would not judge each other and we can tell each other everything and anything.. Unless he thinks he has to keep stuff from me for some reason because I may get upset, hurt or whatever... But I think he knows me better than this.. But I do have some stuff that won't leave the back of my head.. Just don't know if and how I want to present it... I just want my best friend back and to have it like we used to.. Also today (if I remember correctly) is the day I told him I had feelings for him last year and we had a 2hr conversation in the parking lot which brought us closer together.. I should get my surprise tht is significant to it as well... I just want everything back to normal including our fun and play and he knows that.. But anyways enough about that... I have an interview on Friday for a TSR position at a company called connextions for Olympia cameras... It pays more than what I make now... But we will see.. I am not going to jump the gun.. Does not hurt to go interview.. so we shall see... But I hope I get to talk to or see jon tonight.. I do have his truck so I will see him sooner or later...LOL  Well guess I have gone on long enough... till later..."

"event","Well did not get a call from Jon which I was hoping for... But did get text msgs abt him hating certain people because they are liars and backstabbers.  But I don't know why because it was too much to type.. There are only two people he trusts and that is me and K.. So hopefully he will call me tonight and I will find out.. See when he is out of town with K or any of the guys I get no phone calls... But when he is out of town with just guys he does not really know he called me everyday.. I am afraid that maybe he was calling someone else instead of me.. I am so afraid that he is going to replace me or things are changing... But like he has always stated if anything was to change or anything he would tell me because that is just him.. Which is one of the many things I love abt him... I wish I could be as blunt but I am afraid I am going to upset him or something really bad so I feel like most times I have to walk on eggshells because I don't want to screw up.... I want things back to normal like they were last year... But MH and CL tells me that won't happen because he is just leading me on to get what he wants... But jon knows me and he knows if I found out any of that was true I would definitely be over the edge and I don't know if anyone would be able to pull me back...I am still freaking over money... But someone is talking about helping me so I am meeting them on Thursday for lunch.. I can't wait to see what the surprise is that Jon got for me that is significant to the date when he comes back... He comes back tomorrow and I am happy abt that.. His next trip is with K to a concert.. Yipee another weekend I won't get to see him... :-( I just want to spend some time with him and sit down and talk to him to resolve all this doubt and negativity that is being fed to me... But I know him so I should not have to discuss it... But there are some inconsistancies... I just want to get some of our time back and things back to normal without other people or things taking time that I could get.. See I told him this would happen but he told me no it would not so I should know better... He said I should not think I would not get to see him or whatever... Well we shall see... I hope he calls...."

What else is he keeping from me?  Are they getting a good laugh abt me behind my back?  Am I blind to see the truth?  I don't want to believe any of it but there are too many inconsistencies... I got a txt message tonight from our mysterious person saying ""Do you really think you matter? Don't contact Jon and see if he either contacts you or wonders if something is wrong.  I bet not.. Maybe then you will see..."" He also responded to one of mine after midnight saying OK will talk to you soon... Nite... Go figure... He is having fun with the guys and I am kicked to the curb.. I should be used to this by now.. Anytime the guys are around especially K.. Maybe I am doing what I did last year and pushing him away and to other people.   What do I do?  Do I bring all this to him?  Or do I just sweep it under the rug and let it eat at me?  But would he give me a straight answer or just what I want to hear like MH keeps telling me that he is doing... But why would he start this now... Especially with the date and its significance...LOL Don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing... I really don't know what to believe or Think anymore... Am I just stupid and naive?  But why would he do that... He is not the type to hurt people... He has never given me reason to doubt him so why is it so strong now... Just like where is he getting the money for food and stuff up there... I mean put 2+2 together to get 4... I am so confused with the negativity, insecurity, worry and being scared... I am sure he is talking to S while he is up there... He needs to be totally straight with me... We have open and honest communication with no secrets and he knows he can tell me anything and I will not judge him but that does not seem to matter right now... I feel lost and very close to the edge right now... I just need jon to tell me all this stuff is stupid and tell me the real deal... I mean he has not even said anything reaffirming for awhile... Funny when I don't have anymore money that all stops or when someone else came in the picture... I need to do alot of thinking and plan to sit down and have a heart to heart talk with him if he will make time for me..."

Well hopefully I would hear from him today.. Need to find someone who could spot me 20.00 to get through the week.. Well Jon called and he did not want to talk to me last night because I was being a bitch... His boss would not let me pick up his check so I hope he will put it in on Wednesday while he is out and about.. We need to get money in the bank and the other money has not shown yet.. I wonder about that... Well he told me I need to relax and calm down and like he told me before the money woes will work its way out... Sometimes I need a kick in the butt from him and some reassurance.. I would like more.. I usually talk to him more when he is gone but I guess he is spending time with certain people or calling other people.. I don't know why but my insecurity in our friendship is coming back.. YOu know if anything was to change he would tell me.. He told me I was being a bitch yesterday didn't I.. I told him it was because I was stressed and worried and it causes my attitude to shift and he said I need to stop and I am digging myself a hole... I really want to sit down and talk with him when he comes back and I hope I can pick him up at the airport but probably not... Sometimes I feel I am being replaced either by the guys or S ( the person that is back in touch that he isnot telling me the whole story on...)  I don't know why he thinks he has to keep things from me..  I feel I am competing again.. I need to stop though because that is where the insecurity and negativity gets me into trouble.. I need my butt kicked or a good talking to when he gets back.. I think we need to sit down and have a come too meeting.. Well hopefully will hear from him again tonight but not getting my hopes up...

"event","Well JOn is still in Detroit.. Talked to him on Wednesday and he got quite a bit of bad news while he was out of town.. Stuff that came to his house so he was very angry, upset and bitter.. So talked to him a little but then he wanted to go... Then yesterday I was worried about him so I txtd him and he finally told me he was fine and he called me before they were moving cities..  Then today I was off.. did my errands.. Went to see my mom but she was not at work yet.. My bank acct is so negative I have never been this bad before....  Jon txt messaged me and we talked.. I am hoping I can pick up his paycheck to get it into the bank and pay the payday loan off.. Well he called me and I asked about it and he got very upset... Which I did not mean to do.. I am just worried about the bank.. He keeps telling me he put money in but it is not in there yet and I don't know how much more it will let it be negative.. Marti is keeping it open and I appreciate that but I need his help here.. Sometimes I wonder if he is putting his money in another acct but then I am like if that was the case why would he want to worry about this acct.. So I don't know.. Well got a txt message telling me I needed to get under control and he would not speak to me till I did.. So I wrote him back telling him how much it hurt that I disappointed him and made him upset with me.. He told me he had to go and take care.. I got the payday loan pushed off another week but I am running out of excuses.. I hope he is getting a decent paycheck so we can take care of it.. He was suppose to call me when he heard abt the check but he did not so what does that mean?  See that is where my doubt comes in.. What if my small piece of doubt is right and he is putting it in K's acct.. but why would he write checks off of this one.. I don't know.. it could be a payroll issue.  I trust him and really have no reason to doubt him but many people like to stir up any doubt their may be that gets me in trouble... I txt messaged him later hoping to talk to him but he said he would call when he could but we were ok so I could calm down on that end.. But I would still like to know what is up with his check.... He would never hurt me and he would never let me get into trouble.. He is very big on his credit standing and making sure he is not bad with the bank.. So hopefully I will talk to him tomorrow.. I hope he is having fun with the guys.. That is why he is not calling me... But go figure.. REmember the guys will come first... Especially right now.. Well this is enough for now.. I hope I can talk to him tomorrow...."

I just get this feeling but why would he not tell me?  What does he think I would be upset or hurt?  Especially when I flat out asked him.... But why would he make up work if he was not working... I don't know... The conversation I had with mom yesterday I guess opened up the negativity... Then this morning I get a call from the bank... So I txt messaged JOn and he did not rspnd, so I sent another one tellign him I was sorry for ruining his day... STill nothing then i sent one more asking him to call me.. NOthing... So I called the bank and Marti is being really cool and keeping the acct open... Money just needs to be deposited soon... Matt M txt msgd me and asked if I needed the money and I said yeah he said he would be here tonight... He wanted to play like we talked about but I have to get up early and really don't have the gas to go to the airport... So guess I won't see the money... OH WELL Never get your hopes up... Well Jon finally sent something back about him sucking and ruining my life which is not the case... So I told him that but then he said sure that my messages seemed like I was doubting him... I was not trying to sound like that... He said work calls but is he?  (Gotta stop that....) He has never given me reason to doubt him and if he has told me something untrue he comes back and fixes it.. Other people are the ones telling me to doubt him... I love him and care about him and would trust him with my life... I would even die for him if I had to... I just want to know that he is telling me everything like we are suppose to with open and honest communication and no secretst... It can be anything and he knows that... Even if he gets with someone else and has fun (ie sex...LOL) I don't care.. That is why we are best friends... WE are so close and care about each other... Of course there is a few things I would like to do or happen...LOL ( I am so bad..) He has always loved my perverted mind....heehee But of course another thing not to get hopes on...

"event","WEll my week started off horrible... I had not gotten to see Jon yet.  Then yesterday morning my car had the radiator hoses blow so had to have the car towed.. Matt M told me he would give me 600 to help me but that did not happen... I should never of thought it would.. Maybe this is the reason I have doubt in me.... People tell me stuff and it does not happen... Well Jon brought over his truck and he got a phone call about someone he thought was deceased but is not really.. That was a shock.. And things with his other situation is coming to a close hopefully by tomorrow... Also the surprise he said he got me I will not get till he gets back because it has significant meaning between him and I... He remembers when we had our 2hr conversation about me having feelings for him.. He has such a good memory sometimes it is scary... But not a bad thing...He left for Detroit today... I still feel he may have gone on business but really I think there is some personal time involved and some of the roomies went especially K... I don't know why but I don't think he is being totally straight with me... Today I got sent home from work again on IGH which is really making me mad and using up my PTO. I want to take a trip with Jon but can't if I use all my PTO... I called my mom just to see how she is and was going to see if she could buy me a few groceries because my acct is about to go into the negative when two more bills hit.. But instead I got a lecture on how Jon is using me and how she does not believe anything he is telling me... She said I am getting myself in jeopardy because I can't see past the end of my nose when it comes to him... She wants to know what he has over me.. MH thinks he has me wrapped around his little finger and also doubts the money... I really hope it is true because there are a few people that will have to eat their words and owe me a BIG APPOLOGY!!!!  Why would he make something like that up?  That is just not him... But I do have the negative doubt bug that is trying to take over... Why do people think I am so naive and stupid and not a good judge of character?  I should know better than anyone... But could I be wrong?  I don't think so because I don't think God would of brought us together.  He has helped me so much but alot of people think for the worse.... So I am beginning to doubt myself... I don't know who or what to believe anymore... I trust Jon and really have no reason to doubt him that I know of.. But MH said he does not tell me everything only what he wants me to know... What about our open and honest communication with no secrets? He says he tells me everything and I have no reason to doubt him, do I?  I am so stressed, depressed and don't know what to think anymore... I guess time will tell...."

"event","Well Jon called me last night and told me he was on his way and then called me to say good night.. I have a feeling he stopped somewhere but I am not going there.. He has not responded to my email but I had already figured that was going to happen.. I should know him by now.. I know he said he was going to sleep in... He did want to stop by and see me last night but it would of been too late he said... Plus he bought me something while he was up there.. Can't wait to see what that is...  Now to the real feelings... I have this very little piece of doubt that he is either not telling me everything or not telling me the whole truth.. I don't know why I can't shake it.. Does he really not care about me like I care about him.. See the doubt gets me thinking negative and gets me in trouble.. That is not good.. I want to txt message him and tell him we need to talk but he will want to do it over the phone and I don't.. I want to do it in person... I think it is time for a come to meeting... I need the money I gave him back or my acct is going to be major negative... My sister even got on me about giving him money.. Go figure.. I am running out of food and don't know what I am going to do then... I know JOn wants the acct so why is the doubt telling me otherwise.. I need to stop.. HE has never given me any reason to doubt him so why start now.. Who is the one that planted the negativity bug that I can not shake.. It is killing me and breaking my heart because I have no reason to doubt him.. He does care about me and he does love me... He would never let me suffer and he is worried about the acct and money too.. SO WHAT IS CAUSING THIS?????  Maybe I need to do some bridge jumping to clear my head...:-(  IF jon heard me say that he would probably baker act me before I could say I won't... I do still have this little piece of me that thinks I am always going to have to compete with the guys or that the guys will always come first.. (especially K)  This is hurting me so bad that I can barely see the screen through the tears...:-(  See I have not heard from him since this afternoon and I feel like he is avoiding me now.. But for what reason... I just need him to call me... Maybe by the sound of my voice he will know we need to talk... But probably not.. I just want to see him and talk to him about this before he leaves or this is going to eat away at me while he is gone...But knowing my luck that won't happen.. He even said one day was I going back to my old self.. That is where that negativity bug is working... I need him to give me a good lecture and a butt kicking... But please jon call me...."

He called me last night and I went off about money and was being negative so he was not going to ask me to help him... That would of hurt me if that happened... He also said he has a surprise for me.. Can't wait to see what that is...LOL WEll today I am off.. I am really freaking about money.. I have never been this bad in awhile... JOn started off with a txt message so I replied... He called so I talked to him and appologized about last night.. He said he is concerned I am going back to my old self that got me into trouble... We talked about a half hr... He said what he got me had tammy marie stewart written all over it...LOL WEll he had to go do work said he would call me later... So got in the shower and while I was in the shower the pest control guys showed up... I knew that would happen... WEll got out and got dressed... WEnt to the ATM and got money then went to Winn Dixie to WU the money to Jon.. After I did that I txt messaged him and let him know it was sent... Then I went to see if I could get food stamps..I was really embarrassed but it needed to be done... Jon called me while I was there and I was embarrassed to tell him.. He made the statement ""I thought we tell each other everything..""  I said we do but I was embarrassed.. He said why?  I said I don't know.. But does he really tell me everything even if it is embarrassing.. Sometimes I do wonder... But he has never given me the reason to doubt him.. I Know he has never let me down before so why would he start now.. Well we talked some more and then he had to go.. He probably is not coming back till saturday to spend time with the family...  I just want to see him before he leaves and see what my surprise is...LOL Matt M said he would have money for me tomorrow but Jon and I both think he is pulling my chain.. I just hope something good happens soon... Jon said he would talk to me later but I am sure that won't happen.. Wonder what stops he is making on the way back.. hmmmm I hope he calls me on his way home... Not getting my hopes up though... But I will be glad when he is done traveling for a little while.... I miss my best friend... :-("

"event","Well Jon is in Tallahassee.. He left on Monday.. I talked to him yesterday and today.. I really need to stop letting doubt and negativity enter my head.. Jon has never given me any reason to doubt him...  Today was a bad day for him.. His job has lied to him and once you lie to Jon you have lost your trust with him and it will take alot to get it back if you even do... But I really hope the good news he got on Sunday does happen... That will show him his life is turning around... WE also got to talking about something and he asked me a question but I bypassed which is unlike him to let me.. But I sent him an email with my answer so we shall see.. My money situation has still not gotten any better.. But go figure.. My schedule is good though and I start back to UCF next month... I am actually getting free money for once...LOL  I am really worried that jon is paying for other people's stuff that they should be paying for and taking advantage of him... I mean yeah he owes me some but it will be paid back in due time.. I have no doubt and he even agreed to help me... Which I so much appreciate but I know his stuff comes first... I just want to prove to everyone they are so wrong abt him... He is not out to use me... I am not naive or stupid.. But people keep telling me I have rose colored glasses on when it comes to him...  I just know if any of the negative stuff about him is true i would definitely be pushed over the edge and the St johns river bridge would look really good.. But in my heart I know this is not so.. Why can't people just let us be... He is my Best friend and he means the world to me as our friendship does.. I love him and care about him and would trust him with my life.. I just hope things start getting better for him... Till later..."

"event","Well Jon called me on his way home yesterday... I was hoping he came to the luau but I should have figured he would be too tired and I am sure the guys were there.. I got a little buzzed which was nice.. It was fun.. This morning I got up and took the dogs out.. Pretty much stayed around the house all day.. Jon txt messaged me abt something that dealt with his son that he said he would tell me later... Then he sent me good morning and I replied and he said I c which ones you reply to...  I sent him back some responses but never heard anything so guess he did not get them... Well he called and said him and k were coming by to get his tools and beer.. That he would not be able to stay long... They had to get his truck fixed so he could drive it to Tallahassee this week.. I hope I get to see him before he leaves but not getting my hopes up.. Well M started his crap putting doubt in my head about jon and paychecks and money.. Anything to make me doubt Jon... So when he came by I did not know how to address it and he told me to spit it out.. So I did and he told me to tell M to GO TO HELL... I started crying and he told me don't start crying or I won't talk to you.. I said don't say that.. I said it hurts me that I let him put doubt in my head when I have no reason to doubt him because he has never gave me reason to doubt him.. So he had to go.. He said something about a brother/sister thing we have going on.. That kinda confused me so I will have to ask about that when and if he calls.. He was kinda upset with me when he left and I hate that.. But he said we would talk later or he would see me later... But his later means too many different things... I just don't know why I can not let my Insecurity and other people's negativity get to me and get me in trouble with Jon...  I end up getting hurt because I am the one that cares the most... Sometimes I think there are some inconsistences. I know we have no secrets but I still feel either he is keeping something from me or is not being totally up front.. I don't know.. There goes other peoples stuff in my head.. Maybe I need Jon to give me a good butt kicking and a lecture and I will be good to go... I just hope he calls me tonight because otherwise I am not going to be able to sleep well.. I could just shoot myself.. I don't know why I go through this.. WEll we shall see if Jon calls.. Not getting my hopes up though.. I get hurt if I do..."

"event","WEll Jon never called back last night so guess he slept all night and/or did not read my email... Well today I had my interview for scheduling.  I hate that I sounded like I was babbling and you could tell I was nervous.. I am going up against 8 people so M my manager said I should have a good shot... But I am not getting my hopes up because if I do I always get hurt then I beat myself up over it... I am glad JOn called last night though I needed some of his positive words... WEll I hope he calls tonight... I hope he had a good day... WEll he got online and he said he thought he would say hi.. HIs day was shit and he did not want to talk about it.. So he was in a bad mood... Hopefully he won't read my emails when he is in a bad mood.. I talked to him abt a few things... One of our friends called K and that pissed me off because it seems he did not trust me... WEll jon logged off suddenly so I thought I said something wrong so I txt msgd him but he lost connection.  So I told him to call me on his way home tomorrow and reminded him about the luau.. But I am sure he will find a reason not to come.. I have a few things in the back of my mind just trying to figure a way to reveal them and not get myself in to trouble.. Hopefully I will get to see him before he leaves for Jacksonville.. We do have to take the money to the bank... Then he goes to detroit.. I hope I will get to see him and take him to the airport.. This traveling kills my one day a week I get to see him.. But at least he gets online or calls me.. I just need to know that nothing has changed and things are getting back to normal and hopefully our fun and play won't be too far behind....LOL  I definitely think we need to have a come too meeting but not till I am ready and he is going to be back to where we can actually have a full conversation... Well hopefully I will see and talk to him tomorrow... So we shall see... Till then...."

"event","Well Jon got online for a little last night.. He did not talk much because he was tired.. Today I had to go into work at 930 and I hated that... It was busy pretty much all day...  I think I made a mistake and sent Jon an email telling him I feel something has changed but I do... Ever since he has started talking to someone again I feel like I am being pushed off or whatever... I am being stupid.. HE has continously told me that if I was not needed he would not call, email, IM, etc... Why am I letting my negativity cause insecurity because of stupid immature people... I have been told so many times that he only acts like I want when he needs or wants something and that I will never get things back to normal before I started pushing him away... I fixed what I was doing and at times it feels like things are back to normal... I mean yeah I still want our fun and play back along with some other things but I guess in the matter of time.. Well found out I have my interview tomorrow for the scheduling job... I hope I do well.. I really don't like interviews.. Well got to leave early due to connections....LOL So went home and took the dogs out.. They were having movie night at the clubhouse so went and got some dinner.. They had wings so I thought of Jon.. I told A that Jon will try to make the luaua on Friday.. I hope so because it is the only time I will get to see him before he goes to TAllahassee for another week.. Unless he comes and kicks my ass before he leaves...LOL  I don't know anymore.. I trust JOn with my life and he has never lied or broken his word to me so why do I continually  let people push the buttons that put doubt in my head.. I have no reason to doubt him.. Everyone has inconsistences but I would put my life on the line for him because he has pulled me out of the pit that people don't want me out of.. Without him I don't think I would be the new Tammy everyone hates so much.. HE called me and wished me good luck.. He is doing really well in Ocala and I am proud of him.. I knew he would be fine..  WEll he was tired and he gets crabby when he is tired so he was going to go take a nap and said he would talk to me later tonight... WEll I am not going to get my hopes up... I just need to go with what is in my heart and what i know of Jon and stop letting people try to put a wedge between us... I don't know if he reads this butI hope he does... Well guess I am done babbling for now.."

"event","WEll Jon never called back.. But said he would talk to me tomorrow (which is today) but I have not heard from him... Guess he is having too much fun or getting what he wants... I got a bad feeling last night and I don't know why... Bad feelings get me wondering and my negativity flowing... Something does not feel right and I don't know what it is... I know JOn said if anything was changing or had changed he would tell me and he has never lied to me... So I don't know what is causing this feeling.... I would hope he is not keeping anything from me and I don't want to upset him or make him mad... I don't know what to do... Is this my insecurity causing the doubting or what?  I got another message telling me can't I see that Jonathan is only the way I want when he needs something or wants something.. I would hope that is not true... I have also been told he does not appreciate me or care about me like I do him... WHY can't I be stronger than this negativity that is being sent or said to me.... I am afraid I am Backsliding and I don't want that to happen.. That is how I screwed up last year... I am not messing up again....  Just like some things that were said in the car and actions that were happening.. Made me start thinking... I have my sister asking if Jon is going to give me money.. I just don't know anymore.. Why do people want the old walk all over me TAmmy back.. Jon pulled me out of that pit but I feel like people are trying to put me back in it...  Maybe it is time to put up some walls and keep to myself... I do that and Jon will know something is up... So I don't know... I REALLY HATE feeling like this... I just want what we had back (all of our fun and play).. Every now and then maybe some positive words like he used to give me... Maybe when he gets back we take a day and have a come to meeting or maybe I need one of his famous lectures... GOD will someone help me... I feel like I am going crazy or losing control... The downward spiral is starting or maybe I am going over the edge... ST Johns River bridge jumping looks real good right now... (j/k?)  WEll we will see... I am trying not to txt him to see if he keeps his word.. He has never broken his word or promise before.. Will he start now and if so why?"

"event","WEll enjoyed my time with Jon last night.. Somethings said and actions caused some thoughts to stir... Jon had to leave for Ocala this morning.. He will be gone all week and then I am lucky if I even get to see him before he leaves for TAllahassee.. I was afraid something was going to cut into my time that I get to see him and spend with him.. I know it is work but still.. I am glad he calls me everyday pretty much but I still like to see him once a week... I don't think that is too much to ask... I hope not.. Hopefully the guys will bring me his check early in the week so I can get it in the bank....  MY sister keeps asking if he is going to give me money... She needs to understand that he will give me money but it won't be alot at one time.. I don't know why she won't get over that... She is so afraid as well as other people that he is using me and I will never see any of what he tells me or promises me... Jon has never lied to me, broke a promise or his word for that fact.  I have no reason to doubt him.  But immature people put negative stuff or push the right buttons to try to get me to doubt him which gets me into trouble... Jon is a big part of my life and yes I do miss him when I don't get to see or talk to him especially when he is out of town..  But that is only because of how much I care and love him and how much we mean to each other (which I hope is mutual) and have helped each other.. But of course I get told I have rose colored glasses on when it comes to jon... People think he uses my emotions to get what he wants.. I don't know why they think that... But anyways not going to upset myself.. JOn is not here to pull me out.. Sometimes without him I don't think I would be either sitting here right now or the new Tammy everyone hates... But we will see what the weeks hold... I still have some hypothetical things I want to bring out but that is another thing that will definitely wait... I know Jon does not keep stuff from me even though people and txt messages say he does...  But time will tell everything...."

You need to realize this.. Everyone else can..""  I don't know why people can't leave us alone.. WEll starting my screwed up schedule this week.. can't wait to see what they did to me next week.. WEll JOn leaves for Ocala tomorrow... A week without seeing him but hopefully he will call... He knows me and that is hard for me... Well had not heard anything from him and wanted to make sure dinner was still on... So txt messaged him but did not hear anything.. Then I called him on my last break and come to find out he got a message too and cingular is saying I sent it... Why would I send him a message.. I am not afraid to tell him anything so why would I hide behind a text message.. He was upset when they told him that... That bothers me that he would think I did it... But we talked it out and he knows I got one too..  Well he was out doing stuff with K for his trip... So I finished up work and it was storming... He wanted spaghetti so I had to stop and get the groceries for spaghetti...  WEnt home and had to clean up some messes the dogs made... Jon called to let me know when he was going to be here that K was going to drop him off and I could take him home... So he got there and we talked... I asked about the detroit trip and he said it is business... I have no reason to doubt him... Then we talked abt some other things that was bothering me.. So we ate and watched some tv... I wish he could of stayed longer but I know he has to get his stuff ready for his trip... So I took him home.. He does not understand that he is a big part of my life the only one that is fine with the new Tammy and cares about me this way... I know I mean the same to him as he means to me... I don't think it is wrong to want to spend one day a week with my best friend... I wanted a hug but he did not understand why but that is just me and he never had an issue with it before... I just know I am going to miss him.. I am sure he will do fine... The guys are suppose to bring me his check so I can get it in the bank.  I just hope he will call me because he knows it will drive me nuts.. LOL   WEll guess I will see... SEnt him a card just because to give him good wishes for the week... I hope I have some good stuff for this week to say.. I do have some stuff in my head I am going to formulate into an email for him.. Till tomorrow..."

"event","Well JOn did not call me back.. I guess he was so tired that he went to bed...  Next week and the week after he is going to be out of town..  I did not hear from him this morning so I went and turned in the letter to keep the acct open and in good standing till he gets his chk... He needed money for the trip so I did that.. He said he needs money to pay for his ticket to detroit but if it is a business trip they usually pay for it.. Plus he said he does not want me to take him to the airport... That is kinda strange.. I think he is going for personal not business but why would he not tell me if that was the case?  I still would of helped him no matter what but why would he not tell me that.. I just get this feeling deep down that is the case.. That would hurt if I found out he was not giving me the whole truth.. He knows he should not have to keep anything from me.. So why would he now?  I don't know.. Tonight I got another mysterious text message and this came from somewhere else... IT stated Jonathan is not being truthful with you.. He is keeping stuff from you... You need to realzie this.. Everyone else can...  Why is this?  This does not help my feeling I have.. I guess I need to ask him.. I don't want him to think I am calling him a liar or don't believe him but if he is going for personal and as a vacation well that is fine but don't make up a story... Well hopefully he will call like he said he would.. If not I will see him tomorrow hopefully... I probably won't be able to sleep because this will bother me.. IF he is keeping this from me just imagine what else he is keeping from me.. Which I hope he is not.. Open and honest communication with no secrets... But we shall see..."

"event","Well Jon called me last night.. He wanted to talk to me but changed his mind.. So we just talked.. He took something I said wrong because he was grumpy and thought I wanted to start an arguement but I do not like to fight with him... WEll today is my Friday.. Jon called me this morning and I was on break so I came back and called him and he was sick... Possibly food poisioning..  Talked to him a little then had to go back to work.. So he got online a little later and we talked.. He wants to go shopping tonight and to see if I can get money to give him money for gas and food.. So I was like I am sure we can do that... So went home and then JOn called and asked when I wanted to go and I said whenever... So he said he would call when he was leaving.. So he called and said K was coming with us... Not happy about that.. But will have to deal.. I made him mad because I said his sarcastic attitude is why I was not happy plus I was hoping it was him and I so we could talk... But go figure... I started crying after I hung up because I knew he was not happy with me.. So when he got here he was not happy with me and telling me to forget it and we kinda fought.. He gave me two slaps and off we went... (I like the playful jon)  I was trying but it was hard because the one thing running through my mind was has jon let K off easy?  I told him what my sister said abt him giving me money since he has a job... I told her he will give me some money but he has bills to pay too.. I would never lie to JOn and I hope he knows that.. Yeah I have told some mistruths or not full truth in the past but since then I have not lied to him... I know better then to keep anything from him... We have no secrets from each other... At least I don't and i hope he does not either.. WEll we went to publix and then beltz factory outlet.. He kept hitting me for fun...LOL  I miss our fun and play alot.. I just want that and other stuff back.. Well we got him a pair of pants and two shirts and then left.. He kept asking if I was ok or what was wrong.. I was doing some thinking and did not want to talk in front of K either... Well they brought me home and he said thanks and that he would talk to me later and they left.. I was pretty down of course because of stuff on my mind.. M keeps asking if Jon really appreciates me.. He used to tell me he does but has not lately.. I like my positive reinforcements from him... Certain people ask me if he does not just act like I love except when he wants something.. That is not true and why do they think that.. I swear why can't they see I am not stupid or naive.. They still think he uses my emotions against me.. I don't know.. I don't need negativity to SCREW things up between him and I ever again.. WEll we shall see what happens.. Hope to hear from him.. Need to run some more stuff through my mind.. Till later or tomorrow.."

"event","Well I got to talk and see Jon last night... I know where my headache was coming from.. It is our connection and he was having a bad day and was very annoyed.. He called about coming over and said we needed to have a conference.  I agree but we are probably not talking the same kind of conference...LOL  He said that I told him I would do something when the time was right and now was the time.. He said it would make me happy.. Boy did the thoughts start flowing... There was one thing that popped into my mind that I remember agreeing to but I don't think that is what it is because I would never be that lucky...:-/  Of course he should know me..LOL  Well I don't know what else it could be.. So he came over and we talked and then he told me what it was and I agreed to buy him 2 pants and 2 shirts when he got a job.. I did not remember that but as soon as he mentioned it I did.. I wish sometimes I had his memory.. He has an awesome memory which is good and I am sure bad at times...  Today started out slow but then all Hell broke loose..  I was thinking about jon hoping his job was going better today.. I did not get a headache so I think that was a good sign.. Well he called me on his way home but had to call my house phone because my cell was going to voicemail for some reason.. That is strange.. He did good today and I am happy for him...  Now that he has a job certain people keep saying he should give me money.. I am sure he will once he catches up his own bills.. At least for the check but I am not worried I trust him and I know he would not do me wrong.. Even though certain people think he will and only wants to do stuff with me when he needs something... I wish they would STOP!!!!!  Next week he will be in Ocala and possibly Tallahassee the next week.. I will miss him but I don't see him during the week usually only on the weekends plus he can call me... I just don't want to miss seeing him at least once a week.. I enjoy our time as I hope he does as well.. I don't need my fears to start coming back... I don't know why people can't understand that our friendship is special and we have the open and honest communication with no secrets... I don't feel right if I keep stuff from him because of how close we are.. I know sometimes I have to till the time is right but not often..  I feel comfortable telling him whatever and everything and I know or hope he feels the same way.. Well guess this is enough for now.. But I will end with Jon is my Best friend and our friendship and him means the world to me... :-)"

I have been thinking alot about different things and think him and I need a come to meeting... I sent him an email about coming over but we shall see if that will happen.. Did not want to upset him with it... Well it was not too busy which was nice.. I missed Dean though..LOL  We played a board game even Mark played and that was nice..

Well jon did finally log online and I got to talk to him.. He wanted to know why I entitled my email ""many things"".  I know he will read my emails but he does not respond to many of them.. I know he only responds when he needs too but sometimes I would like an answer... I finally told him about the txt message that really got me upset.. He did not want to know what it was but I got it off my chest.. He just was not in the mood the few times I did get to talk to him.. And it bothered me because I was keeping it from him and we have out open and honest communication with no secrets.. I just want things back to normal and our fun and play back.. I miss the old times... He starts his job tomorrow which I am happy for him... I am sure he will give me some of the money back which will prove my sister and everyone that he is not using me...

Well on my last break I called JOn and he sounded upset... He did not want to talk to anyone last night so that is why he did not call... I asked him why he was upset but he kept doing the stuff to drive me nuts...LOL Then he started to blow a party horn.. So I asked if they were having the july 4th party and he told me No but I wonder.. He has never lied to me so why would he start now.. We have no secrets if they are having a party I hope they have fun... I don't think he would not tell me that they were having a party... But he would not tell me anything but said he would talk to me later... I hope K did not give him an issue about talking to me in private yesterday... That would be stupid if he did .. He is suppose to be working on the friendship not worrying about ours.. M keeps asking me if jon really appreciates me... Also am I sure he is telling me the truth and everything.. Why do they keep having to bring negativity into my head and life...  I have never doubted him before and he has never lied to me.. So why are they working so hard to cause me issues... They just want to put a wedge between jon and i because we are so close.. I know if anything changed or he was not telling me everything he would tell me and I have no doubt about that... He has always been up front and tell it like it is... That is something I love about our friendship.. We have open and honest communication, no secrets and can tell each other everything..  I don't ever want that to change.. I love him and care about him and our friendship means the world to me... Well hopefully he will call me later... I don't want to have to send an email....LOL Even though he does not answer...heehee :-p Well guess this is enough for now.. Till later or tomorrow..."

Today he called me and said he was coming to see me for 2 mins.. I felt like I was in trouble... OF course K was with him.. I knew it would not take long to get back to normal.. I know Jon can take care of himself...  But I worry because K can also be manipulating.. But anyways.. He needed money for gas so he could go see his aunt that was not doing well.. Unfortunately I did not have it and felt like I let him down because I could not help him because he ended up not going so that made me feel bad... When he left I was crying because I felt so useless because I did not have any money to give him for gas.. It was nice he wanted to talk away from K but still... Certain people keep telling me he does not appreciate what I do for him and he makes up stuff not to see me at times... Do I think this is true?  No not really but it does get my negativity going since he has not said anything positive to me to reinforce me lately.. He has not even said he loves me like he used to.. I mean I know all this inside but sometimes it helps to hear it.. Is that so wrong??? I am just afraid that now things are really going to dwindle.. I know he will be upset with me about this but he knows that is one of my biggest fears... I guess I am just being stupid.. But sometimes my negativity starts flowing and then I start getting upset.. I mean I got one of those secret messages again and it upset me really bad... Did he get the feeling something was wrong.. hmmm no.. But when it had to do with the house or K he got a feeling so that is just not right... I get the feeling when something is wrong with him.. LIke today I got the feeling but I knew he would contact me if something was wrong and he did... I hope he is not upset with me because I couldnot help him but he said it was fine.. I don't know... I just need to talk to him and we need to have a come to meeting I think... He said he would call me later but he has not answered any of my messages but 1... So we shall see..."

"event","Well Jon is back home.. Last night I got to take some stuff over to him for his room... The color definitely has to be changed....LOL Keith was helping him but I know Jon can take of himself... I just care about him so I get a little over concerned.. But I am afraid that I won't get to see him that much but he told me ""why wouldn't I and that I should not think that..""  I think my insecure side I have been working on is trying to come back out and cause me issues... He has not said it lately but I know he does appreciate and love me and he really cares.... Some people think that he does not appreciate me and only tells me he loves me and cares because that is what I want to hear... But I don't believe that...  I am feeling really down right now and some positive words or some positive reinforcement from Jon would be nice.. Why do people plant negative stuff in my head so I start doubting myself and my best friend... I trust our friendship and he has never made me doubt him.. I should have no reason too... So why can't people get over their jealousy... Maybe because they don't have a guy best friend as great as I do... If anything happened to our friendship there would be a large hole in my life... He helps me and I help him that is why we know each other so well.. I would give up my life if I needed to for him plus would go to the end of the earth for him as I am sure he would do for me.  (even though people say he wouldn't)  I enjoy our IM conversations, emails (when he replies), phone calls, txt msgs and visits... Jon and I have the open and honest communication with no secrets and a trust level like no other and that is IMPORTANT... I am not afraid to tell him anything as I hope he is not with me... Sometimes I just have to figure out how to word it so I don't get him upset or mad... Well this is enough for now.. Hope to talk to Jon later... Bye for now..."

"event","Well Jon made me go to bed early last night... He went and got his wallet and was gone for awhile... I am afraid they are trying to convince him to come back and give in and forgive everyone... I was worried so I txt messaged him and then he called me... So did not get up when he got back but I could tell something was wrong... But don't know... Today was pretty slow.. I was not as tired as yesterday... Jon was talking somewhat but he told me the dreaded words I knew would be coming... He had been thinking about things and was going to go home to see how things go.. I am glad he is going to have his own room... He told me not to get upset but that is hard.. I would not call it upset I think saddened would be a better word because I liked coming home and him being here.. But that is going to change and he will probably go back to how it was.  I am worried about money but that is not new... I hope he hears something on his.  He could use some good news... He said everyone was leaving him alone which I hope is right.. I just hope he stands his ground.. I trust him and he was hurt pretty bad this time... He knows he always has me and a safe place.. Some of my fears are trying to rear it's head such as like:  the guys wanted him away from me, I did something to make him leave (if that was the case I think he would of told me...), I am afraid the time will diminish again... But why do I think this... I just want him to be totally truthful with me about everything... There is no reason to keep things from me... I know, ""When he is ready he will talk...""  I enjoyed spending time with him it was nice... He was even a little playful which I have not seen in awhile...(I was glad to see that and I miss that...) I am glad we have our open and honest communication with no secrets.. My sister does not think he tells me everything and is not truthful with me... I have never caught him in a lie or found out he told me something untrue and if he did he corrects himself...  I just hope he stands his ground and is careful.. I know he is close to the edge and I am not there to keep him from going over but he knows how to reach me any time day or night or just come by... I love him and care about him very much.. But I guess I will wait and see what happens... I just don't want him to shut me out... I don't think he would but I am afraid of what the guys may say about me...  Also are hypothetical questions bad especially when they give you the answers you want even though it may never happen... Jon is my best friend now and forever... I am here for him..."

"event","Well went with my sister last night to get ice cream.  I could not get my mind off of Jon but that is because I care about him.  I hope he read my email.  I don't think he read my card because I never got a response from the website that he did.  But he knows I care.  Well about 2:49am I got a text message from him saying he is tired of it all and wants to end it all... Tired of being the helper.  So we went back and forth till after 3am.. I don't know what he is keeping from me but he knows I am here to listen.  I am really worried about him.. I love him and care about him alot and am really concerned.... I have helped him before when he went this kind of mood and i plan on helping him again.. But he has to let me in.. Even if he needs somewhere to stay he knows he has a place here... He said he is over the edge which I was afraid would happen but I am going to try to bring him back over.... I can't lose the one person that has helped me become stronger... My life would not be the same without him... He has helped me so much now it is my turn to help him but he has to let me in so I can... I am just glad he is reaching out that means alot to me that he trusts me and knows I care that I will do anything to help him or keep him here... I wish he would get some good news on his money situation but all with in good time... He needs something good to happen to him... Him and I have never kept anything from each other and this is hard... WE have open and honest communication with no secrets... But as he has before and he said many times when he is ready he will talk... I will be here to listen and help him through it... I support him and do not judge him... He knows he can come to me with everything and anything and I can be unbiased... I called him at lunch and he really did not want to talk... I started crying and he told me there was no need to cry.. But it is because I am concerned and care so much that it hurts me.. He thanked me for caring and being concerned.. He said when he is ready he will talk.. So I will just have to wait... NO matter the time or whatever I am doing I am here for him and he knows that all he has to do is call or come over... Waiting is half the battle..."

"event","Well nothing from JOn since the phone call.  I hope he reads my card.  I have not got a response yet that he has.  Well Dean was not at work and it was not real busy.  So I caught up my paper journal and read some.  I also wrote Jon an email because I am really concerned about him and want him to know I care... I know he knows that but I needed to get it out on paper... So I read it a few times to make sure it was not sounding pushy.... Well missed playing cards today.. I left about 2 hr and 5 mins early and used PTO for it because Jon was on my mind and I was worried... So came home... Took the dogs out and finished watching my soaps... I sent a txt message saying just to let you know I am thinking about you and hope you are doing ok.  He sent back Thx.  Not talking.. Then I got another one saying ""Don't worry about me.  Not worth the effort. Don't reply.  I am done with IT ALL""  That scared me so I went ahead and replied and sent another one after that but have not heard anything yet... I am not understanding why he is trying to keep it to himself... But I am here when he is ready... I hope he reads my email and responds... But he will probably read it but won't get a response.. (Because I want one....lOL)  I know he trusts me and believes in me then tell me what is up?  I don't care if certain people is feeding crap into his head about himself.  He is better than all of them... I just hope he will call me..  I just want to hear his voice... I was about to break the rule and call him because it is time I stepped up to the plate and made him listen... But I have not yet... Well Teresa called me and wants to go get ice cream so we will do that.. They are leaving for Tennessee on Friday... My friend from Tennessee is suppose to be in town and we are suppose to meet up so we can finally meet and have some fun...LOL  Don't forsee that happening.. Well I will wait for JOn but I want to know he is ok..."

"event","Well was hoping Jon would of called me but did not hear from him... I am really concerned about him... I have not seen him this bad for awhile... I prayed for him that God would help him with whatever it is or let him open up to me like he always has before... I don't know what is going on now that he does not want to open up about it... That is very unlike him..  Well did not hear anything from him all day.. So about 3pm I sent him a txt message saying Hey.  Just checking to make sure you are ok.  Because I had a very bad dream last night and from other times that I have seen him bad... I have seen Jon at his worse and we have always got through it...  Well did not hear anything till he called about 7:30 pm to let me know he is alive and still pissed maybe worse... I said Jon what is going on and he said he does not want to talk about it.. But why???  What has changed?  We have our trust level, our open and honest communication and we have no secrets so what has changed now... I can be nonbias and just listen.. This scares me.. Is he talking to the guys?? I am just not used to him not talking or venting.. It scares me because the more he keeps it inside the worse it gets and may blow him over the edge... I heard it in his voice tonight... I don't know who or what pissed him off.. Have an idea but will wait for him to tell me...... He knows he can come to me or call me anytime... He can even come over here to be safe... I dont' care if he calls just to vent or yell... I am here.. I am sure he needs smokes and I know no one will get them for him... I would if he would ask because when he gets like this smoking calms him down... I am feeling very hurt (kinda) because he does not want to talk about it.. I thought our trust level was the same.. Did something change and he did not tell me?  No, I know him if anything happened he would tell me unless someone tells him not to... I guess I will just have to wait.. I did send him a card last night I hope he likes it... I care about him and want him to know I am here for whatever he needs and he knows that... So waiting......"

No one seems to care.  Im done with everyone... bye... That scared me and really worries me.. I don't know what happened and he does not want to talk to me... What am I chop liver because I care and he knows that but I guess he means his roomies/guys... He won't talk to me... He asked me to let him be, please and that is even harder on me.. I know he is hurting and I want to help like I always have before.. We have always gone through his problems or issues together... What is different about this time???  I told him I care but he knows that... I hope I am not part of the everyone.. I have not done anything to piss him off.. I am just trying to support him... I know Jon is stronger than this... I pray every night for him and that things will get better for him... I just want my best friend back and him being able to talk to me like he always has before... I am really afraid he is going to shut down... I just want him to call and talk to me or even get online... I will listen like I always do with no judging and won't say a word about anyone... I know that is what he wants.. But he is really scaring me... WE have the best trust level in the world and our bond is strong... I have not seen him this bad in a long time... He knows how to reach me... I am available for him no matter the time or whatever... He is the most important thing in my life and I want to be here for him and help him... I guess I just have to wait... It is hard for me but as a true best friend I will do what he needs... I hope he calls.. I could really use hearing his voice right now... I will wait for him and be ready to listen and be the shoulder he needs..."

"event","Well Jon did not get back online last night... I was hoping he would but guess he went to bed early... I know his allergies were kicking and his back was hurting... Well actually hoped he would have called but that did not happen either... Well today was nothing either... I am really concerned about him... I text messaged him about 3:30 because I had not heard from him he did not respond till much later with not well.  Thanks.  Pissed off. bye... So I sent why are you pissed... but of course got nothing back... It is so unlike him to keep stuff to himself... He always needs to vent like I do... I mean I understand problems waiting till he is ready to talk about him but when he is mad he usually likes to vent.. He knows I will listen so what is the deal... I was hoping he would get online but that did not happen... I want to send him and email or a card but I don't want to upset him either.. I do know if he was upset he would have already been all over me but I do know I have not done anything to piss him off I don't think.. I mean he was fine when he left last night... I just want him to start talking like he used to... I know he thinks he is a loser and a liar but that is not so.. He has never lied to me from what I know and he has pulled through it just might not of been right then... But I guess I just have to sit and wait... I have prayed for things to go right for him and I actually for both of us... I have also prayed that he would call me and talk.. I will just listen if that is all he needs... I am just not used to not talking to him on a daily basis... Sometimes I do wonder if that is what the guys want... To keep me out of the picture but I would hope Jon would not let that happen... We are too close and have too much together as best friends for that to happen... Well hopefully I will hear from him soon.. I will wait.. IF I get nothing I will send an email or I may even call.... Don't know... Time will tell...  (Jon I am here just call...)"

"event","WEll went to bed last night concerned about JOn.  All of a sudden yesterday he was in one of the moods he has not been in for awhile.  But he does not want to talk about it which is so unlike him.  We have never kept problems from one another... So that kinda bothered me... But like he has always said when he is ready he will talk about it.. So got up this morning still very concerned about him.. Still have not heard anything about the money for the check or Matt but I trust him... Well he got online in the afternoon and said he was amazed I was online.. I said I am always online... He said Thought maybe you would be mad after the email I sent you this morning.. I said what email?  He was like figures... He said he was appologizing for not having money and for being a fucking loser... I told him not to go there... He said he is working on the money issue.. He is still in the mood he was in yesterday maybe a little worse... I hope he is not telling anyone like he says... I know Keith and Jeremy may try to get it out of him... That is why sometimes I feel shut out or needed because of them but I know I should not and he has told me that many times especially yesterday.. Well he wanted spaghetti for dinner so I made it but he put down ground rules such as no talking about anything we normally talk about or he will leave and the food had to be ready by 4pm... When he is in this kind of mood he keeps to his word. JOn has never lied to me or not kept his word from what I know...  Even though other people try to tell me differently... I just want him back to normal and everything back to normal and on the right track... I am afraid he is going to get too close to the edge.. Well I felt it was one of those times for my famous cards so I gave him one thanking him and wrote him a letter too... I guess he liked it... He never says anything.... I just hope it helped... I just want him to know that the trust level we have and the bond we have is one of a kind and we have always gone through each other issues together before that is why him keeping this one to himself is different.. So I don't know.. He knows how to reach me and where I am so when he is ready or whatever he knows where I am no matter whereever, whenever, or whatever time I will be here for him... But in the mean time I have to be the true best friend and respect what he wants and know he will come to me when he is ready to talk.. He is not shutting me out or I am not needed like other people say.. He will not leave me short on money and I know that... Even though certain people try to say that is all he uses me for.. All I can do is go by what i believe in my heart and know he is not the type to hurt me or anything... IF it ever did I would be crushed and I think that is what people are wanting... Well I will be here when he needs me otherwise I will just care and love him and be concerned from afar.. Guess this is enough for now.. Till later or tomorrow..."

"event","Well JOn txt messaged me and told me he was alive but not doing good.  Speak to ya soon... Then later today he sent me some interesting messages.. I don't know what that was about.. They were funny don't get me wrong but they were not him.. When he said speak to me I think online or by phone but when I asked he said no... I just get this feeling that either something else is wrong or he is avoiding me.. I don't know why I get that but I just do... I mean everything is coming due tomorrow and I don't know what is going to happen... I know when he is sick he wants to be left alone but not to get online or call me because he knows how I am that scares me... I just have my feeling and it causes fears.... I just have things in my head that I can't seem to get out or let go... I just don't understand... I have never had a reason to doubt him and he has never lied to me.... So why is the stupidity sticking in my head...Maybe I need one of JOn's come to meetings or one of his famous sermons that have always helped... I just want him to be proud of me and continue to appreciate me and love me as his best friend... I don't want to screw up anymore.. I just want everything back to normal and him to get some stuff he so desperately deserves... JOn has had too much bad stuff going on in his life the last year and for once we need some positivity for him even if I can't give it to him... Well I will be here for him no matter what and he knows that just like he will be there for me I am sure.. I guess I may just have to tell him what I need... I don't know.. He knows me so welll I am sure he knows stuff I don't even have to tell him... Oh well I will just sit back and wait... Time will tell..."

I did talk to him last night and he said his interview went well.. Which I am glad even though he is more talented... Jeremy is suppose to be depositing the money but nothing yet... I hope that is not bad... I hope his lawyer gives him some good news soon because Jon definitely could use it..  But I think something else is bothering him... I know he is not ignoring me (I hope)...LOL  But I just have that feeling something else is wrong but I can't figure out what and I don't want to ask because he is not in a good mood right now...  I know I can't fix everything... I wish I could because I wish I had the magic wand that could because Jon deserves better... But all I can do is be here for him like I always am to listen or let him vent or whatever no matter the time... I would go to the end of the earth for him... I would even give up my life if I had to.. As I am sure he would do the same because that is how close and how much we care for each other... Of course I may be speaking for him and I may be totally off base... But I don't think so... Some people keep trying to tell me that I don't really know him but how do they figure... And why would they say that?  I am hoping to hear from him tonight but I am not going to get my hopes up... WEll I will just keep my fingers cross and hope he calls or even gets online..

Just like I don't understand why sometimes he does not answer my emails... He does not even email me that often and I don't understand why.  Is it because we talk via IM or phone... I don't know.. Just like HYPOTHETICAL questions... What good are they if people are going to give you an answer they know you want to hear... I thought they were to help put a situation into perspective without coming out and asking it... Yeah I have questions I have asked or questions I want to ask but what is the sense.... There are certain people that seem to think Jon only tells me what I want to hear and he does not give me the full truth.. But why?  Where do they get their nerve?  They say I am naive, pathetic, stupid and have rose color glasses on because of how I feel about him... He is my best friend and I care about him and love him as he does me.... What is the CRIME in that?   Yeah I may be pathetic because I am 35 and single but what is the harm in that..  I just want people to realize I am not stupid... People say I am too trusting or trust too easily... Jon and I have a bond and was open with each other from the beginning.. God knew we would be good for each other and help each other out..  I am glad he can read my LJ even though I am not sure how often he does or if he even does since that day...  I know my world and life would not be the same without him... I just want the old times back... But I don't know if that will ever happen.. I guess I shall wait and time will tell... Need to stop the negativity and let other people start it... I want jon to be proud of me...."

I looked at it online and I can't wait to see it in person.. Jon did tell me a friend of ours thought he was buying his friends and their bond.. But that is not the case because that is not going to change even with this positive thing happening for him that he so desperately needs... He also told me he has an interview with Mcdonald's which I am sure he will not have a problem getting but I am afraid that between the positive stuff and the job that our time is going to continue to diminish... I know it is stupid but I can't help it... I don't get time like i used to with him and I miss it... I mean yeah I get our dinner but he does not stay long then... I Know he is in pain but still... The guys get to spend more time with him then I do.. ( I know I need to stop this.. but I get scared....)  He knows my fears just like he knows me.. I just miss the old times and want them back...  Jon means the world to me and our friendship does as well... I don't want anything to change... He has helped me so much as I hope i have him.. I really need his positive reinforcements and I need to hear that he appreciates me and loves me and cares for me... I guess it is just my self doubting.. But coming from him it helps... He has given me so much to live for..  I am so glad God brought him into my life and I would die if anything happens to our friendship or him... He is so much a part of my life and has helped me change for the better...  Time will tell......"

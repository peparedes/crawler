Draft CHD subject search summary.

Quite a lot of worthwhile stuff on Dare that can go on when a protocol has been devised. Subject area is very broad; again, large overlap with MI, arteriosclerosis and stroke. Most of the major guidelines are on already. Was quite selective about what material went on - left off some of the more minor non-UK guidelines.

Now on congenital heart defects. http://www.acr.org/cgi-bin/fr?tmpl:appcrit,pdf:0067-72_suspected_congenital_heart_disease-ac.pdf - good document, but RMS won't accept URL."

Chest pain - 11-15/05/04
Summary:
Not much available on this topic. Suspect this is because much of it falls under other, more specific condition categories such as angina and MI. Much of the available literature also relates to non-cardiac chest pain. As usual, I suspect that the ACP journals might yield useful results. However, such a generalised search term was a bit confusing to the indexer, which probably didn't help. Two quick queries: http://www.acr.org/cgi-bin/fr?tmpl:appcrit,pdf:0079-84_acute_chest_pain_no_evidence_mi_ac.pdf relates to chest pain, not entirely or even principally to cardiovascular conditions, and http://144.32.150.197/scripts/WEBC.EXE/nhscrd/expand?saan=0000280631 - not sure how to index DARE abstracts.

The Harcourt International journals site may well contain worthwhile material, but a subscription would be required in order to ascertain this. 
Two additional queries relate to the Bandolier Atrial Fibrillation site and the way in which PRODIGY documents should be catalogued."

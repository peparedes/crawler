"event","I had a dream this morning that I was at my grandparent's house, which is in the country, with William Moseley (Chronicles of Narnia). We were riding bikes extremely fast and we stopped at this old house. We wandered around for a bit and then we sat down, and were talking (about Ghost Hunters) and just as I was about to kiss him (>.>), Jorge Garcia walked in. He walked around a little and we scattered. Then William Moseley said something like, ""We weren't up to what you think we were up to,"" to which I muttered a bitter, ""Unfortunately, not yet."""

So I get better every time I try, right? Here's my latest drawing, of Rachel Weisz. Lots of flaws, but it's probably the best one I've done so far. Her eyes are open much wider than in the picture and her lips are not very detailed.

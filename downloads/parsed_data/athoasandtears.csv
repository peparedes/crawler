I dunno, I carry my cell phone with me everywhere just hoping he's going to call me... granted it's only been 2 weeks.  I'm going to stay with him no matter what, it's just if I were to see him I couldn't tell him I loved him.  I dunno why, but I do want to be with him always.

I'm going to prove all the people wrong who tell me it's not going to last.  I just love doing that.  Right now I keep doubting everything... I'm afraid he is going to leave me and find somebody who is way better than me and who's perfect for him.  That makes me want to cry but I'm so worried about that.

I found out recently that one of my friend's isn't a virgin anymore and for some reason I don't like that.  I feel like I'm being overprotective of her, I started talking to my mom about that, I told my mom I was being a little hypocritical but I just can't believe she would do that.  She's a really smart person, and this guy may just ruin her life.  Maybe I just don't give guys enough credit.  There's some other relationships with friends of mine and I'm perfectly fine with who they're with because I know the guys'll treat my friends fine.

Is it me, or are a lot of people getting married early?  I'll prolly join them.  I asked my mom what she would do if I married early and she told me she'd tell me to think about it.  I don't care.  I love him, too bad I haven't heard ANYTHING from him...uhm ugh."

When I was driving home today, I was thinking about this time after I found out that I got a C- in math and told my mom so she started lecturing me.  I was close to crying, so Jordan took me home to get my stuff so I could stay the night at his house.  When we were driving to my house he went REALLY fast down this one road and I almost cried because I was already depressed but he was pissed off at my mom.  So then he tried to drive me to Kalin's house so I could have ""a friend to talk to"" but he passed her house, so we drove around Battle Ground and Yacolt.  I dunno what the point was of that story.

I went over to his house on Thursday and I'm trying to think of what I did, I know I laid in his bed a lot and watched him play videogames.  I came over to his house almost crying that day and just being around him cheered me up.  That night we watched the WSU game and wrestled like idiots.  Can't even remember that much of Friday either.  We went and saw Ghost Rider and then went to Walmart around 9:30 or so.  Hung out there for an hour and a half.  Then he made me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  On Saturday he really wanted to go paintballing but there wasn't anybody there, I felt so terrible!  So went back to his house and he washed his truck and for some reason that made happy.  When he was taking me home, I almost cried because I wanted to be with him and I knew my days were running out.  I came back later that night, and we watched Miami Vice, then his dad made me eat a pizza because he doesn't think I eat anything.  Then we cuddled that night hmmmmmm.  Sunday mostly consisted of watching him play videogames.  Then at night was his going away party.  I talked to his best friend and grandma.  Yup.  Then I pretty much teared up and cried on my way home.  

Today though, I went and watched him swear in.  If only I could explain everything.  I love him.  I love cuddling with him."

"event","This weekend in all wasn't so bad.  Friday was a whatever day at work, as usual.  I really do hate working there.  Anyways.  Jordan came to my house, met Pete and Jaci and all the little people.  All they did was talk and we were like ehhh whatever, and then went to bed.  On Saturday we bummed around until 12 or so and then we went to the mall and I bought a pair of pants that were actually on sale, I'm damn proud of that.  Came home around 4 and I really don't remember what we did from 4 until 7.  But at 7, we went to see Norbit (and btw Crystal was with us from the mall to the movies), but dude I was just checking my bank account and they charged me twice!!  Ugh.  

Then we went to Fred Meyers coz I need to get some nasty stuff.  Came home around 9:30 or so.  Jordan made all of us... spagetti (I CAN'T SPELL IT SORRY!!!) and it was pretty tasty.  Crystal pissed me off coz she was like ""I don't like spagetti with sauce on it."", oh BITE ME.  My brother seemed like to like it, along with Lukas.  I went to bed stuffed and happy.  I'm lucky I got me a guy that can COOK!  

Sunday, Dennis made a big breakfast but Lukas and Crystal were stupid because they didn't get up when Pryce AND Taylor told them there was breakfast... so they missed out on that.  Jordan and I went to Fred Meyers again to get the correct stuff that I was supposed to get, and then I got 2 books (Zodiac, and Christine by Stephen King), chips, and razors.  He got chips and a Snickers bar.  We came home and he looked pretty tired so I told him he should sleep, so we laid in my bed and I read Zodiac (pretty interesting book, even though I'm on Chapter 3) and then we fell asleep for a half hour or so.  Then we took the kids (as in Pryce, Taylor, Crystal, and Lukas) all to Red Robin.  They treated us like crap there, they forgot about us and never gave us boxes...wetwetwgfaegaidiotskakwjtwlkejt.  Then we went to Hollywood Video and rented Spider Man 2 and Saw 3.

When we were watching Saw 3, I felt like I loved him more than I ever have.  We mostly watched the movie, but every once in a while I would ask him stupid questions, or told him I didn't want my relationship to be like this one girl's relationship that I work with, I don't want to be stuck at home while he's out doing whatever, he told me he wouldn't do that and kissed me.  It was just that whole night that I felt closer to him and all we were doing was laying on the couch watching a gory movie.  Go figure.  But I love him so much and he's leaving in two weeks.  Okay now I'm getting teary eyed.  Back to reading my book.  Nobody cares about my love life anyways."

My life is a wreck.  I cried at work again because I suck and I'm just a baby.  I went on break to play around with my cell phone to find out that I had 3 voicemails and 4 missed calls.. I found out that my stepmom is currently in the hospital because she had an asthma attack.  Pretty much, nobody called me until today when it happened on Sunday.

I have no money, and everything happens in February... or at least just this week and next.  Me and Jordan's 5 month anniversary is on Friday, so I figured we could go to the Cheesecake Factory on Saturday and I'd pay... but I only have $70 which is supposed to last me until next Friday.  Then this chick is planning a going away party for Jordan on Sunday and wants me to pay for half the stuff.  My grandma's birthday is Monday.  Then Valentine's Day is Wednesday.  I need to just die.  Then I still owe soooooo much money to the parents, oh and apparently I owe money on my taxes...wtf.

School and such always kills me.

I want to cuddle with anybody but I doubt my friends would cuddle with me... well, I could prolly get Michelle into bed with me because she's easy to bribe with.

I kept telling everybody nothing was wrong because in some truth it was true, I just wanted to be left alone.  Jordan kept coming up asking what was wrong, or randomly calling me asking me, each time I hung up.  My PIC let me leave 30 minutes early because we were pretty dead, when I got out to my car there was a rose under my windshield wipers.  When I got home I took a shower and then about 5 minutes after I came out Jordan came over with another rose.  I was shocked.  He told me the first rose was for the day before and the other rose was for yesterday.  Damn, he's way too nice.

This morning Jordan went to school with me...well, I went to class and he went to Fred Meyer's and bought stuff.  Then he drove me to a park in downtown Vancouver, it was absolutely BEAUTIFUL... of course it was cold so we didn't stay very long.  I want to go there again, hopefully before he leaves.

This only has to be a one page paper, but of course I haven't even written it yet and it's due tomorrow.  Not so bad, but what is bad is a test I haven't even studied and here I am procrastinating, and writing run-on sentences.

Last night was somewhat amusing.  I watched Jordan help Walter move from Kati's duplex.  I made fun of them, telling them they would make a great couple, or they were hot together.  When we were going to Walter's sister's apartment, Walter had me ride in the car with his mother, so we had a rather good chat, she was really friendly.  Just the whole time with them was great.  Walter's mom thinks I'm really nice and sweet...HAHA, if only she knew me better.  Then I went to Jordan's house and we started watching The Illusionist.  Ahh... how I love cuddling.  He was kissing me and then he told me he was glad that I came over.  I hope I marry him (I know that's young and naive to say).  We're way too alike, it's weird.  But I feel so bad for him sometimes, I hate going to his house because it makes me feel like a freeloader coz I eat all the time there (mostly because he forces me to eat).  His dad is currently unemployed and is having a hard time finding a job...and his brother is just whatever, he spends his money a little too much (and he makes 30 grand a year).  I'll love him no matter what.

It's icy.  I've done almost all my Christmas shopping and I have more money than I thought I would.  YAY.  Except I still won't have enough to pay for my books.

I got called into work yesterday.  Ugh.  Around 8, my mom told me that my work was on the phone and I'm like, ""WHAT!? WHAT!? WHAT!? WHAT!?"", only to find out somebody wanted to go home because of cramps and another called in sick...so now that really screws up my schedule.  GRRRR."

"event","So I will tell you about my fun in Mexico.  I don't give a damn if you care or NOT.

<lj-cut text=""It's REALLY long but READ IT... it took me an hour to write... due to me being sidetracked!""> 
Day 1-- Woke up 5 minutes before 5 and started poking Jordan out of excitment and because I love him.  Our plane was delayed for an hour while we're still in the stupid thing.  Finally hit Mexico.  Unpacked for a little bit.  Then we went to Margeritaville.  Very lovely.

Day 2-- Woke up, went to pool and hung around there for a couple of hours.  Got tan, face burned.  I can't really remember much during the day after the pool, but around 5 or so we went to this place called El Squid Roe.  It was pretty rad.  I got a Sex on the Beach (ohhh Jordan was making comments about that which I said no to).  Got a little tipsy or so, and took some crazy pictures.  That was the end of that night.  Oh the making out but you don't need to hear about that.

Day 3-- Pretty much lounged around the pool and the room and because I'm a mean girlfriend, Jordan went out to eat by himself.  The next day we went fishing.

Day 4-- Went on our little fishing trip.  Half of the people got sick (my mom, my brother, my sister, and Jason)...and me and Jordan almost got sick due to the massive bumps and the smell of diesel.  But Jason, Jordan, and Dennis all got a Marlin (aka a swordfish) but Dennis killed his... so we couldn't release it.  When we got back to the hotel room we were all exhausted.  My mom mentioned that they were going to this Cheeseburger place so I get myself all pretty and everything and then ask Jordan if he wanted to go and he said no, so I started tearing up.  My mom was asking me some question about pesos and I walked out of the room and went to beach and cried.  After 10 minutes I started going back to the room and I saw Dennis and there my mom was on the balcony and she was yelling, ""You're in trrrrrrrrouble"".  I didn't care.  Then she was like, ""Where'd you go? You know you're not supposed to go anywhere by yourself."" And I cried that I was at the beach and that he wasn't coming.  Well, apparently Jordan was out looking for me, but he came back to the room after a few minutes when I was crying in the bathroom.  So while my family went to the Cheeseburger place me and Jordan sort of talked.  I wasn't telling him the reason I was crying (because it's stupid and I was being selfish)and he told me that I drive him crazy and the next thing I knew was that he had his foot on the bar of the balcony and I went over and started crying more.  He kept asking questions like ""Are you breaking up with me?"", ""Are you crying because of me?"", ""Is it because of your family?"", all I could do was shake my head no.  I told him I loved him and I didn't want him to go away... and blah we talked for a little bit... and then he ate some cup of noodles and then we watched Pirates of the Carribean 2.  Oh and apparently when I was half awake or not even awake I made him turn the movie off... woops!!!

Day 5-- Me, my mom, my brother and Jordan all went parasailing, it was a very nice day and very nice and peaceful!  Of course on our little boat thing, we had this one chick who was sooo ANNOYING, she just wouldn't stop talking but whatever.  She told the captain of the boat to dip half this chick's body into the water (if they did that to me I would've flipped out).  We then went back to the hotel and did the whole pool routine.  The waiter brought out our drinks and in our drinks there were pieces of plastic... which is kinda gross.  Jordan and I accidently fell asleep out by the pool and then I woke up and started poking Jordan and then my mom made fun of us because half of our bodies were red.... we didn't burn or anything but yea.

Day 6-- Hung out by the pool.  Then we went on the Buccaneer Queen (aka the boat they used in Hook).  It's a sunset cruise thing.  (I keep getting sidetracked and now it's 10:23).  Anyways, so my mom pretty much volunteered herself to do stuff (even though she said she had no idea that's why they were asking who's birthdays and such were this month).  She had to drink a shot of tequilla and then do the Mexico yell, then she had to act out as a pirate.  Meh, of course she won.  One of the guys on board asked me to be the damsel in distress in their little skit so I went up in front of about 30 to 40 people and screamed because a pirate had captured me.  HA.  I don't go up in front of people.  After the end of this little 2 hour cruise my mom was a bit drunk.  After that my mom and everybody else wanted to eat so we went to Romeo y Julieta, which a somewhat fancy Italian restaurant, and there my mom is talking really loud and kept repeating what she said 5 seconds ago.  Ahh my mom was irritating me.  She snapped at my when I corrected her pronounciation for pollo which is pronounced ""poy-o"".  So Jordan, Pryce, and I went back to our room.  Sometime around 3 I woke up, turned off the fan because I was cold and that ended up being a good little night for me.

Day 7-- Brandy, Jason, Jordan, and I went shopping for random people.  I got Amy, Kalin, and Cherie stuff which I thought was pretty cool.  We went to this little jewelry store and Jordan bought me a ring!! It's so pretty!  Damn him.  He told me he bought it for me as a Christmas present even though he got me 3 presents also.  Never get stuck in the bathroom with somebody else.  Pretty much the last day was a whatever day.. except I watched The Island.

I was at Jordan's house and excited that I got a C- because I thought I had done wayyy worse... and then she was like, ""You're never going to make it into the program."" and ""You're never going to go to anywhere in your life.""  I just sat there and Jordan put his arms around me.  He was like, ""I'm sorry, nobody in my family never said that to me.  I can see why you want to move out.""  I just sat there.  I almost cried but I couldn't let myself cry.  I wanted to just die right then and there or just slit my wrists, anything to get away from this.  We drove to my house and I got my pills and got glared at, of course on the way home, Jordan decided on this one hill that you can't see that well that he was going to go 80 mph... We drove around a little, went to Yacolt and such.  Then I stayed the night over at his house, by the time we were at his house, I was in a little better mood.  

I want to die right now.  I'm just tired of stuff.  I'm sorry that my brother and sister are smarter than me.  I go to work and I think I don't care that you found out you're pregnant, I don't care that you're boyfriend cheated on you but now you're engaged, I don't care that you were in a car accident and decided you didn't want to come back to work for 6 days and then leave early due to your neck ""hurting"", and I don't care that you're going to break up with your shitty boyfriend.  I need to get the fuck out of here.  

Somebody kill me, please.

I need to take my last pill and die."

I was at the doctor's and uhm the electricity went out... in a room... it was dark... I couldn't see... it was scary.  I, of course couldn't pick up my prescription so I need to leave in a few minutes because the electricity is back on over there. 

When I driving on Mill Plain (A VERY BUSY ROAD) all the lights were out... for at least 3 blocks. It sucked majorly!

Last night was pretty interesting.  Jordan looked sooooooooooooo GOOOOOODDDDD last night.  I was almost drooling.  We went to our dinner party... got lost as in which building our people were in, it was WINDY and COLD !!!! I holding onto Jordan with my teeth chattering. The party was amusing.  I didn't win anything this year!! But I got perfect attendance!  Watch Jordan pretend to sing (he claims he was).  Laughed.  Tried to ignore people who were trying to flirt with me.  Made it so Sean won an $82 table saw.  Oh he owes me.

I almost cried then but then called Cherie.

Then I'm just like WTF and almost cried then too.  I'm tired of her talking about one guy one week and how she ""made out"" with him and then changing to a new guy the next.

Yesterday when I was going to Walmart, my mom was telling me how she and Dennis were talking about me and Jordan and they said that if we weren't together now or didn't work out now, it would work out when he comes back and most likely we would get married.  It's weird because sometimes I think he is the one I'm going to marry.  Right now I don't have many other people to go off of because I haven't really been with anybody.

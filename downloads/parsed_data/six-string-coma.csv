"event","Well... This is my first post ever... Went to the beach today, I was kinda bored, but I brought the dog and my friend Chris, so it was allright.... sort of contradictory, but meh. The dog (Sofee, she's a chihuahua) went swimming, it was funny! When she came out she looked like a drowned rat.
   Anyways, the point of this post: Chrissy(AKA a_perfect_scar on LJ) came over! Woohoo! haha... Well... She called me to go for a walk,but I was too tired, she claims its laziness, but I keep telling her I was tired, the sun tires me. So she's here now. She started me with this LJ thing... It seemed cool... But.. yeah it seems cool. Later we are watching movies, 3 of them... which are:


 -Edward Scissorhands

 -Almost Famous
 
 -Zoolander

     So I guess thoses are the plans for the evening. We ate icecream earlier... isnt that rebelious, hehe... Anyways Im off..."

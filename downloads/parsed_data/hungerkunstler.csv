"event","In the numbing wake of this world-spanning tragedy which has yet to entirely sink in, to become fully and nightmarishly real, one considers the different aspects of Michael Jackson the man, the icon, the curiousity, the rumour-mill.  It's a testament to the voyeuristic predation of our gossip-fixated society, I think, that the very afternoon news of Jackson's demise is confirmed, news outlets seems oddly conflicted as whether to laud the man and his artistic legacy, or titillate the masses with further unsubstantiated charges suggesting a dark and debauched ending to match the dark and debauched seclusion of Jackson's which fed so much scavenging postulation.  The very same day, as if no room or space be need left for the respectful settling of this tempestuous news, no time to mourn the passing of this enigmatic man, simlutaneously so much larger-than-life and yet so saddeningly small and tortured, a study in paradox and duality in one charismatic, brilliant package.  In hindsight, Jackson's impact and iconic status almost make his rather lengthy professional life seem unusual by its very duration, as if such a bright and tragic star should necessarily have burned blindingly but briefly, dying mysteriously and suddenly while young, another James Dean, Jim Morrison, Hendrix, or Joplin. 

But Jackson didn't: he sustained a career full of mind-bendingly numerous hits much longer than even the deified Presley, and the gradual warping of his persona seemed to mirror in curiosity the weight of his iconic identity, breaking his already fragile child-star-withered superego, to use Freudian terms, leaving him pointedly deaf to the reactions his oddities would provoke, and sadly blind to the true face of the desperately perfection-seeking ""man in the mirror"" his increasingly mutilating physical modifications so shockingly revealed.

As I type this, the glow of VH1's Jackson video retrospective flickering out from the adjacent TV screen, I'm startled at just how many marvelous MJ songs I've forgotten: The recent ""smooth criminal""-recalling Cuban cameo-fest of ""Rock With You"", as catchy as the best of his 80s material; the oozing evocative groove of the Eddie Murphy and Iman - featuring ""Remember the Time"", with Jackson as some charming and devilish upper-Nile sorcerer gifted with such condusive sexual pheromones that his robotic gyrations send the Egyptian court into an orgy of sudden erotic coupling, almost against their will, while Pharoah Murphy can only impotently stamp his foot as his queen literally swoons in Jackson's volcanic embrace; the hypnotizing, almost narcotically smooth sway of Jackson's besequined, green-lit ""Rock with You"", one of the best from his earlier solo days...and then of course the cultural touchstones: the world-dominating ""Thriller"", whose MTV premier was such a major international event that I remember quite clearly taking a break from a childhood chum's birthday party as his mother summoned us all to the television, where we watched in hushed and suitably reverential awe as the red-leather clad ""Corpse of  Pop"" so marvelously scared us and ""thrilled"" us with his dynamically choreographed, inimitably influential dance moves and childlike, over-the-top sense of spectacle and wonder; the stylish paranoia of ""Billy Jean"", with its posterization-effected Oz-ian backdrop and endlessly debated lyrical enigmas; my personal favorite 'Smooth criminal"", with its marvelously synchopated table dancing and seemingly effortless moonwalking; and of course the clearly ""Warriors""-influenced balletic violence of ""Beat It"", in all its ""West Side Story"" glory.  

If any theme seems to run through Jackson's work it's one of labyrinthine struggles, endless pursuits, and childlike fantasies of escape into the worlds of entertainment and recreation.  This is perhaps not so strange, considering th crushing work ethic imposed by Jackson's domineering, overbearing father, who from such an early age pushed the developing Michael into showbusiness with such dogged intensity that, seemingly, Jackson never experienced the relaxed satisfactions of a happy childhood, and spent his whole life (whether through obvious wish-fulfillment such as his Neverland Ranch or the more insidious  and puzzling associations with his omnipresent youthful companions) attempting to recapture one.  Certain works make this especially evident: on its surface ""Black or White"" is an empowering, electrifying paean to racial integration, full of the grand humanitarianism which typifies so much of Jackson's '90s material, but the video's introductory vignette tells a different story, one of Macualay Culkin, so fitting in the role of eternal youth and optimism, scolded by his loutish father (played by the same actor known for his drunken ""Cliff Claven"" character from ""Cheers"", the name escapes me) for enthusiatically and fervently enjoying his favorite song alone in his room.  The scene is intended as a humorous one, and it is, but there is something in the furious, threatening up-stairs climb of the approaching father figure, so angry and so much larger than the pixie-ish Culkin (who is entirely unaware of the impending reproval), which contains within it all the torturous echoes of child abuse and misused parental authority, and given Michael's own experiences with the rather large and frightening Joe Jackson as his father, the scene carries with it an unintentional chill.

Let us hope, then, that in death this enigmatic and eternally youthful man will recieve the peace and wonder of a childhood unfulfilled, the comfort within his own skin which his much-discussed physical metamophoses, whether genuinely initiated by a pigmentation deficiency such as vitaligo or not, seemingly never achieved, the ceasing of his tortured but brilliant inner voices.  There has been discussion that he'll be buried with his single trademark glove, and we can only hope that it serves him as well in death as it did in life: one lone sequined glove, wholly original, containing the raised fist of triumphant and eternally jubilant defiance.

We'll miss you, Michael."

so kyle informed me that we'll be seeing depeche mode AS WELL AS the reformed jane's addiction / nails show; i believe these two concerts are separated by a month or so (jane's / NIN being first) and anxiously await the original jane's lineup, as well as (kyle's description) the consciously compartmentalized nails show, with space given to different genres within their library.

But I'm MOST excited to obtain my Gil Mantera's Party Dream T-shirt; Kyle I will owe you eternally for this gift! and it's especially timely 'cause several of my fave band shirts have recently fallen into disrepair...OK that's sugar-coating they're threadbare: Kill me Tomorrow, Lords of the New church, and my white birthday party T.

Oh, yeah.  I've gotta see IAMX this summer, one of the few modern acts i dig at all.

so for some reason, i've really been getting into sex-gang children and andi's solo stuff again recently.  that and coleridge - i forgot how amazing his poetry is, and i haven't really read any of it seriously since high school.  last night i stayed up late with coffee and coleridge, exploring kubla khan, rime of the ancient mariner, the pains of sleep, and (of course) christabel.  the strength of this last piece is such that i believe it would work as easily as a short story, or even, with some expansions, as a novelette.  i remember when i first explored it...it was something of an epiphany for me, realizing as i did that within the confines of this academic poem was contained all the horror, mystery, and suspense of lovecraft or poe.  i realized, then, that narrative poems could be just as absorbing as short fiction, opening a whole world of new colours and plots to my mind.  i recommend coleridge to anyone with an interest in the horrible, the esoteric, and the phantasmagorical.  he's a writer who can really merit the use of such decadent praise.

i also found strong and resounding parallels between samuel taylor's life and my own; i knew that many of his school had dabbled in opiates and laudanum, but the partiuclars of coleridge's relationship to the drug, and his trials and triumphs resounded in my very soul, as did the complicated chronology of his romantic life...and even his work habits.

i'm the sort whose interest blooms eternal when i have a connection of empathy and relation, and these experiences, so similar in their fashion to my own mad past, lit the corner of my brain that enjoys the pure and perfect expression of ideas and experiences.  of this, at least, coleridge is masterful.  his terminology, his idiom, even his reversion to archaics is a fantastic, labyrinthine library of the soul.  my only regret is that i stayed away for as long as i did.

it's good to be home."

So, during my recent used film buying frenzy, I accumulated more movies than I could easily watch, and ended up putting some aside for a rainy day.  Although I was initially intrigued by Art School Confidential, noting that it was based on a Dan Clowes comic and directed by Terry Zwigoff, (of ""Crumb"" fame) it kind of got lost in the shuffle, and made its way to the very bottom of my ""to view"" pile.

Apparently last night was just such a rainy day.  I couldn't sleep, (again) and I didn't feel like reading or Zelda, so I decided that the time was ripe for a light-hearted comedy.  As it turned out, I was completely wrong about that ""light-hearted"" bit, but I'm getting ahead of myself... 

My introduction to ""Art School Confidential"" came years earlier when I read  a biography piece about Clowes in an issue of Wizard, which reprinted several panels from the ASC comic itself, including one hilariously self-deprecating scene of the young Clowes character's  initial interation with art school girls.  I made a mental note to explore his work, but it wasn't until I discovered ""Young Dan Pussey"", ""Eightball"", and ""Ghost world"" that I recalled the Wizard piece....and I never ended up reading the comic that this satirically unsettling gem of a film is based upon.

The title itself conjures up imagery of the hard-boiled, sexploitation sort, and this connotation is obviously deliberate, although it also works as a lampooning send-up of the genre itself, like everything else in the film.  One of the greatest achievments of ASC is that it manages to toe the line between over-the-top exaggerated parody and cinema verite ""slice-of-life"" realism... leaving the viewer altogether puzzled about the resolution of the film's chief conflicts.  At times desperately bitter, mockingly brilliant, and curiously innocent, ASC manages the difficult task of ushering the audience into a cultish world seen through the eyes of an outsider...and then actually forcing the audience to change its suppositions and loyalties as the protagonist is doing so himself.  this is no small feat.  Composed of a melange of art school sterotypes, the characters are so true-to-life that their potrayal can hardly be termed parody.  We've ALL met these sorts in school: the teacher's pet, the snobby pseudo-intellectual, the manic hippy, the jaded professor.  ASC marshalls a veritable parade of self-delusion, wielding dialogue and interaction with a deft touch, and coaxing bravura performances from John Malkovitch, (the world-weary art teacher whose jaded exterior masks a deep-seated desire to be more artistically accepted) Ethan Suplee, (the aggro 3rd-year film student whose transparent attempts to convince freshmen of his sexual prowess offer some of the film's funniest bits) and especially Max Minghella in the lead role.  Minghella's desire for nigh-unattainable dream girl Audrey (Sophia Myles) is palpable, and his slow descent into pessimistic cynicism is depicted with an authenticity that makes his later lapses of morality seem perfectly reasonable.  This is one film that i can genuinely say kept me guessing; not only was the outcome itself a complete surprise, but several key developments were so unexpected that I was in a constant process of re-evaluating the sort of film I was watching.  This seems to be characteristic of Clowes' work, and Zwigoff's as well: both 'Ghost World"" and ""Crumb"" purport to be largely comic, but find much of their resonance from an underlying sense of world-weary, lovelorn melancholy.  While not overwhelming the comic aspects, this dramatic counterpoint creates an almost immediate identification with and sympathy for Minghella's Jerome Platz.  Subtle adjustments to wardrobe, makeup, and styling artfully render Jerome's progression from wide-eyed optimism to sullen acceptance, managing all the while to hint that beneath his increasingly cynical shell, he still hopes his inital dreams of success and romance will come true.  If this sounds multi-faceted, it absolutely is: all of the leads undergo some sort of a development over the course of the film, bringing the audience along with them, and all of the characters are more than they initially seem to be.   

The ending of the film is unsettling; although we already understand that jerome's world has become too cynical and desperate for any storybook 'happy ending"", our identification with the characters is such that we hope for this tidy conclusion all the same.  And interestingly enough, the most horrifying moment of the movie comes NOT when we witness a strangling, not when we realize the killer's identity, but when Jerome hangs Jimmy's painting in the classroom as if it were his own work.  This is a highly charged, poignant moment...the camera pans from Jimmy's horrorshow creation to Jerome's innocent, somehow virginal depiction of Audrey.  Our reaction is very different from the character at this moment; Jerome is realizing, wrongly, that Jimmy's work is an authentic masterpiece, and the  stark contrast between the two depictions makes him see his pencil sketch as childish, naieve, and representative of all the unrealistic expectations of success he originally engendered, of which Audrey was the most cherished.  The audience, on the other hand, mourns the path of deceit Jerome is taking with his drunken deception.  It's not even what we know these paintings will associate Jerome with, but the complete and total loss of his youthful. creative spark that leads him to commit such a blasphemy as claiming jimmy's work as his own....this is the true tragedy.  once Jerome has crossed this rubicon, the remainder of the film is largely an unwinding of minor story arcs, and a reaapraisal of characters who've managed to chip off a chunk of Jerome's success.  One of the best details is the audiences understanding that Jonah has been effected by his surroundings; more than just his job, his early success had lead him to genuinely care about his art and how it's recieved.  This is a great bit; not only does it make his character more likable and less one-dimensional, but it's just WHAT would happen if such a blue-collar joe began to be lauded for the artistic expression he'd never had an outlet for.  Unfortunately, in order to explain Audrey's final choice between Jonah and Jerome, ASC tips its hand in showing Audrey's reaction to her realization of Jonah's true purpose.  After the film has gone to such lengths to suggest that what an artist does and how he lives has no bearing on his art, this self-contradicting bit of romantic fluff seems not only pedestrian but somehow hippocritical.

On the other hand, we all want Jerome to get his muse in the end."

so basically, i'm interested in finding some new horror flix for october.  having recently purchased alien 2, hills have eyes 1 & 2, silent night deadly night 3, blood feast, event horizon, ....uh...there's more but i'm blanking.  what i'd REALLY like to find are some old hammer horror pics from the 70s....something along the lines of ""the creeping flesh""....anything with peter cushing or christopher lee, anything that has that ""dark shadows"" intensity and gritty british-noir edge.

or even any b-picture that rises above the drek, like ginger snaps or the darkness.  any recommendations?  or any reviews of the ""wicker man"" remake?  i'm beyond curious about how nick cage remade that one....especially because the original is so lauded / lambasted.  actually, to digress, i discovered that what makes certain prints of the original ""wicker man"" so unwatchable is the fact that these particular edits are cut so unprofessionally as to completely cripple the continuity.  there do exist WELL-EDITED prints of wicker that retain the film's intensity and make the plot much more comprehensible.  so....lest hear some recommendations for some buried horror gems, 'K?

i checked out 'darkness', with anna paquin, on a recommendation from johnny.  it was as phenomenal as he had said; the blurb on the cover claiming it to be a hybrid of the shining & amityville was really quite accurate, and the film as a whole did justice to those worthy comparisons.  Yuzna (dagon, re:animator, etc.) is one of the two directors, and 'darkness' has the same spanish feel that dagon had without being directly lovecraftian. 

here's some of what makes it so genuinely creepy: 1) no computer generated special effects whatsoever; everything is accomplished with sparing use of makeup, lighting, and some tricky camera play. 2) the film manipulates the dysfunctional family dynamic artfully and successfully creates a palpable sense of unease and mistrust.  3) there is little gore, but when the red red groovy comes out the scenes are so charged with emotion and tension that they are nearly unwatchable, in the best way that such scenes should be.  4) the cinematography is, bar none, some of the creepiest i've ever seen.  that, more than any narrative similarity, was what warranted the kubrick comparison.  certain scenes suggest a feeling of being watched, a very uncomfortable sensation of an unseen presence, that the visual darkness intensifies and compliments.  5) the ""spooks"" are never clearly shown, merely hinted at with back-lit silhouettes or referenced by  horrifying sigismondi-esque sped-up-motion flashbacks.  

i could go on and on, can you tell?  the spanish setting meshes smoothly with the occult atmosphere, the acting is understated enough that the bursts of frenzy seem genuine and intense, etc. etc. etc.  

heartily recommended.  4 bones."

i took home a pre-street of the aviator last nite and was, i guess, entertained.  i still can't see dicaprio as any older than he was on growing pains....and jude law makes a really lame errol flynn (cary elwes, anyone?  hello?) but the movie is exciting enough.  cate blanchett is little more than a caricature....and some of the howard hughes cliches are really overdone, but it's not as bad as i was expecting.  i would have enjoyed seeing less of hughes' lovelife and more of his kleenex-boxes-for-shoes-period.  i just never see dicaprio as anyone other than himself; he doesn't transform the way you really need an actor to in a biopic.  hmmm.

"event","rented ""fade to black"" yesterday.  it's something i've been wanting to see for awhile, but just never actually picked up.  it's about this lonely, misanthropic loser obsessed with classic cinema ie: bogart, rathbone, cagney, monroe, etc.  Hollywood's golden era.  anyway, because of the rejections of a girl who takes on delusional significance in his mind (because she resembles marilyn monroe) he embarks on a killing rampage, with each murder styled after the deaths in one of the many films he's obsessed with.  it's real dark & grainy 'cause its '81, but i enjoyed it nonetheless."

it was great...they had her in the theatre with just a mic, a podium, and a red spotlight.  she ranted and raved about bush and the war for a bit, then broke into pieces about love, relationships, and the nature of sexuality.

"event","i'm trying to compile a list of all the lovecraft films that i'm aware of....here's what i've got so far:

*beyond dream's door
*bride of re-animator
*the curse
*curse of the blue lights
*DAGON
*the dunwich horror (dean stockwell!!)
*forever evil
*from beyond
*necronomicon
*re-animator
*the unnameable

hmmmm....i'm excluding films with a ""lovecraft-esque"" feel; i want the films on the list to be straight from the source, not just ""influenced by"".  i also didn't include the 3rd re-animator sequel as its name escapes me...

out of the pack, 'dagon' is obviously the pick of the litter, with 're-animator' and 'bride of...' following close behind due to the hilarious mix of gore and jeffrey combs' unappreciated leading-man potential.  'dunwich horror is a relic', and not in a good way....'necronomicon' (aka ""h.p. lovecraft's necronomicon"") is absolute garbage; basically a loose grouping of tales with nothing outstanding.

'from beyond' is worth seeing.

this genre has so much potential; i'd love to see someone turn ""cool air"" or ""at the mountains of madness"" into a feature-length film.  but i'm not holding my breath..."

"event","for no reason other than the aforementioned need to infuse myself with halloween spirit, the following is a short list, in no particular order, of some horror films i enjoy and why:

*in the mouth of madness*  obviously the not-so-subtle h.p. lovecraft references tickle me pink, but more than that i just love the whole evil feeling that this film gives me every time i watch it.  it's a great mixture of scary ideas (terror) + scary visuals (horror) with a few ""screamy sudden pop-out"" moments.  sam neil is masterful as the eternal skeptic; he doubts the seriousness of his situation until things literally ""unhinge"" right in front of him.  full of countless genuinely ""creepy"" moments and dialogue that just pops into my head when i'm trying to sleep at night.... (""he.... sees you"" ""do you read Sutter Kaine?"" ""you're my mommy.  you know what today is?  today is mommy's day."") OK i gotta stop with the quotes....i'm giving myself  the creeping horribles.

*severed ties*  my recommendation of this B-grade splatter pic is solely based on the last thirty minutes of film....in which the darkest, most twisted, most horrifyingly literal example of the oedipus complex i have ever witnessed is driven hilariously home.  it almost seems that the last bit of the film was scripted by someone else; there's not much to recommend the only-average acting, etc. in the rest of the story.  But the ending?  wow.  see if that doesn't make you squirm.  

*shivers*  i think the standard U.S. release title is 'they came from within' or some such quasi-exploitive phrase.  i prefer the one word canadian release title.  i've always enjoyed cronenberg's decidedly ""wet"" take on horror: from his interpretation of burroughs' 'naked lunch' (mugwump jizzum anyone?) to jude law's biotech horror-game paranoia in ExiStenZ, cronenberg always depicts viscera with an eye for shiny, lubricated ooze.  and he makes it real, and he makes you care about his characters, so it's even harder to watch.  'shivers' is the most determinedly sexual horror film i've ever seen...that actually pulls it off.  alot of flix have tried to straddle (heh) the line between scare and screw, but cronenberg is at home with this subject matter and he plays this tale of oozing, crawling venereal disease like a maestro sawing away at his violin.  highest possible recommendation.

*halloween 3 - season of the witch* don't expect any michael myers references; this film is unconnected (thankfully) to the mound of horrible carpenter-cribbing sequels.  can you believe that donald pleasance actually acts in most of them?  poor man.  anyway, i just like the gritty, slow, 70s-style pacing of this film.  the halloween masks that turn kiddies into killers - that was a gem; gotta give props there.  sure, the end wanders and none of it's really genuinely frightening, but it just gets me into the halloween spirit in a way that few larger budget films can.  i guess this one is really a bit of an oddity.

more later, no doubt..."

"event","was perusin' my old deadjournal....hmmmm....i din't like anything else about that blog other than the ability to load a dozen user icons w/o having a paid account.  but it's so much fun to look through writing from even a year ago....and going back a couple more than that is really eye-opening.  I don't write, think, dream, or laugh the way i used to.  is that growing up?  is that maturity?  i hope one day soon i'll know.

so halloween's creeping up on me way too fast, just like last year.  I think it's a truism we're ALL aware of, but i'll say it nonetheless:  time absolutely flies when you get older.  the worst part of this is letting holidays slip by, treating them like any other day because the responsibilities and duties of your life don't give you the time to relax and soak in the holiday feeling.  

i guess for the past couple years i took for granted that working in a mall around the winter holidays guarantees that you'll at least be constantly bombarded with Xmas carols....and we all know that the good ole galleria pulls out all the stops when it comes to getting tarted up for Xmas....

but i don't have that this year.  I bought a pumpkin on friday, and i watched ""dracula: dead and loving it"" on TV this evening, but other than these two details, I've made ZERO concessions towards the spirit of halloween.  and to think that all through my school years it was, hands down, my favorite holiday.  i guess this summer weather isn't helping any; for those of you who care we've had record high temps for the past two weeks....mid 90s all day.  it's fucking evil to deal with that sort of weather when you're trying to get in the fall swing of things, you know?  and of course all the clothes i like to wear are of the warm and heavy persuasion.  my peacoat is crying for a walk, but i know he'd smother if i let him out.  so i guess we both have to wait.  

I'm excited about seeing ""saw"" (with cary elwes!!! sp?) at the end of the month.  when the whole mystery / serial killer thing is done well, like 'lambs and 7, i really enjoy the experience.  but i guess the phenom of ashley judd assembly-line style detective flix has spread a lot more crap around in that genre than there used to be.  speaking of crap, i attempted to get into ""nightmare before xmas"" again but....and i full realize that this is blasphemy to many of you.....i just can't get into musicals.  I mean obviously the character designs and story are genius, but, i dunno....i just can't do it.  and believe me, i've tried.  

would we consider 'the labyrinth' a musical?  If that falls into the category then i might have to re-evaluate my opinions of the musical as a whole, because obviously i've always had a soft spot for bowie & muppets, but...hmmm.  this is getting rather long.  i'll continue tomorrow..."

I just finished two midterms which were all essay....and i just finished my definition essay on the nature of fear.  that one turned out rather well, but the writing muscle is still tired.  and i really should be completeing more entries for my brit. lit. journal but....can't bring myself to.  they'll have to wait for tonite or (more likely) tomorrow before class.

"event","so i've had a chance to ruminate on the horrifying events of yesterday and i've also gotten a bit of new information:

as of 9:00 pm last nite the old man was in critical condition @ herman hospital....so there's still hope, i think.  I can't leave the situation behind; i see reminders of the horror everywhere.  I was cutting tomatoes for a salad yesterday evening and was almost overcome by the whitish tomato seeds in a red, watery pulp on the cutting board.  teeth in a bloodbath.  it was all i could see.  I keeping thinking about death, unconsciousness and sudden tragic loss.  

I have to write a paper on the psychology of fear for next week, and although i know it's generally frowned upon to include personal experience in any work of scientific/analytical worth, it's going to be a struggle for me not to let the shadow of that horrible, panicked terror from yesterday cast a definite pall over the point-by-point minutiae.

I guess my penultimate analysis is this:  the random brutality and velocity of the act is part of what made it so incredibly scarring.  less than a second and one's body can be reduced to crippled, lacerated incapacity.  it could have been my dad; i'm fairly sure that the man had a family.  it could have been lauren; she shops around there all the time.  

it's the not knowing that gets to me.  the reaper could be bearing down on any one of us with incredible speed and specificity of purpose....and we would never know until we had collided head on with mortal destiny.  a train bearing down, while you idly meander down the tracks with a walkman and headphones oblivious to looming doom.  some beserk renegade avenging angel smiting people at random like a spree killer stumbling into a luby's and unloading a shotgun into the people at the utensil bar.  

life is suppose to be richer for those who've felt the reverberating wake of death's falling cleaver.  and i think i'm finally beginning to understand why ..."

I was driving home from my comp. class....on westheimer in the vintage / resale / tattoo shop district in front of vintage oasis and taurian body piercing....

this teenage girl in the curbside lane (i was on the inside lane) mowed into a middle aged oriental man crossing the street; she didn't even brake.  she took him out at the hips and suddenly that expression about a body ""being tossed like a rag doll"" was driven horrible and suddenly home before my eyes; i was about 1.5 car lengths behind her and the whole scene unfolded with that slow-motion dread which seems to accompany terrifying shock.  the poor man was struck with such force that the change in his pockets landed 15 feet away on the road away from the body.  quarters, dimes, and a bus pass. i parked immediately and called 911 on my cell...thankfully a cop coming from the montrose PD stopped and helped block off the intersection.  The man lay bleeding and gurgling foam, twisted at an impossible angle from the waist down.  his teeth were on his shirt and in the gutter....he was unconscious and almost looked as if he was dreaming.  I gave a full report to the police and left them with my information and a witness statement....the girl didn't even brake.  i can't get over that detail.  no skid marks, no tire squealing, only a massive wet crunching sound that was loud enough to draw people out of the junkshops and boutiques in investigation.

vehicular manslaughter is not enough.  the first thing the girl said to the cops was a lie; (which you can be sure i immediately refuted!!) she suggested that the man had stepped in front of her car from the north side of the street, when in reality he was crossing from the opposite side....in plain sight.  she had more than sufficient time to decelrate.  She was crying alligator tears and seemed much more concerned with her ruined automobile than the horrible bloody mangled form folded in the ditch.

tragedy follows me this year....first my grandmother, then muffy, and now a total stranger violently cut down before my very eyes.  life is precious."

kyle (my best friend) went to school with one of the ex-tripping daisy members (rick) who is now in polyphonic spree, gave him a ride from austin to houston, and made plans to schmooze with the band after the show tonite......AND.....polyphonic spree is opening for the inimitable mister bowie tonite...

SO.....

guess who's seeing bowie and hanging out with Polyphonic Spree after the show?

go ahead, be jealous."

took some AMAZING pictures of lauren....in her red satin naughties on our heart-print duvet cover.  absolutely dizzy with desire.  you've GOT to see these pix.  to be posted soon!"

"event","life requires all sorts of coping mechanisms....it's always interesting (sometimes horrifying) for me to see what people are capable of when they're trying to deal with anxiety, sadness, and stress.  i have to wonder if ANY awareness exists at ALL re: this sort of self-defensive rationalization.   

the idea that someone could hold on to a grudge for more than a year....then ingratiate themselves in order to get back into the grudge ""causer""'s sphere of reference....with the eventual intention of lashing out viciously under the cautiously re-built, ingratiated trust....absolutely unspeakable.  this is the poison fruit....the faked smile....the knife-in-the-back....the blood vendetta.  i'd hate to live the life (so wholly swallowed by hatred) of one who plans and organizes such subterfuge.  the guile that replaces alleged love...the false sincerity in empty reassurance....i am completely floored.  initiate the motions to make me apologize to you....then kick me when i've exposed (admitted) a weakness.  there are no words for you, my dear.  for all of my shortcomings, every last one of my sins, mistakes without number.....i make public atonement.  consider this the final word.

hold that hate tight when night comes, darling.  i have something else to keep me warm."

i separated the pics from my last entry into 2 entries....just because.  my dad gave me his cashmere burberrys scarf, so i don't have to use the above sad relic anymore.  oh, and i got a new black wool jacket...it's excellent.  i'll try to post pics with it while we're still in the brief texas winter / fall.

pictures from last danseparc....i couldn't resist posing with the terminator 2 arcade stand-up now that ah-nold is the gov. of cali.  plus the blue/red/black colour scheme of the coin-op housing perfectly echoed my outfit. that's environmental accessorizing.

"event","no work today....thank jebus.  after getting 0 sleep following danseparc saturday nite....and work sunday morning / afternoon....i was all kinds of draggin' yesterday.

gotta go pick up some sheets and things i left @ my mom's house....now that the apartment is squared away and looking nice, we might as well have the sheets that fit, you know?  just a detail.  sushi last nite was much needed and appreciated....but i drank the last of my ricard while eating....so i'll have to invest in some more (or some other pastisse) this week when i get paid.  hmmmm...

lauren showed me julien donkey-boy w/ ewan bremner from trainspotting....absolute genius.  i didn't enjoy the movie, i didn't ""like"" it, i was FLOORED by it.  so deceptive; it's filmed in such a grainy, unprofessional manner that one would expect the plot to be scatter-shot, but harmony korine sculpts the narrative and makes his point with precision and definite direction.  like a puzzle or a house of cards, every little piece has a fit and function.  amazing.  very hard to watch; in terms of emotional / psychological trauma, it's certainly nothing you could term ""entertainment"".  but with that caveat, it pushes the envelope and re-establishes MY perception of film as an invaluable artistic medium; a lance to pierce the status quo and bleed the jaded awake.  art as the message, art WITH a message....and nothing to be casually ingested.  next to cronenberg's ""spider"" i suppose it's one of a small handful of films that show mental illness from the inside...and paint a picture in crude strokes of horror and empathy which is an absolute shock to the system.  highest possible recommendation."

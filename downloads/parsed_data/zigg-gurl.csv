"event","so yesterday was officially a busy busy day, stayed up til 3:00am reading, (yes...i am a geek), then got up at 7:00am to go garage saling and shopping, didn't get back until 12:30pmish, then cleaned up a bit, put my new stuff away, headed down to chars, came back around 6:30pm, then went out at roughly 9:30pm to see the longest yard, got back at 12:30am sunday (today) and i am going to be babysitting from 9am - 1pm today as well as helping in a kitchen at 5pm-7pm. i still have yet to finish my english project as well...oy. 

the longest yard was amazing, i saw it with colin, kevin, and mr. weatherby. such a good movie, i laughed so hard, man adam sandler is good. now a realization i came to...this may seem completely unlike me considering i absolutely despise and loathe most rap, and the artists, but wow...nelly looked hot in football pants and convict clothes. the best part by far was the actual football game, man so sweet. 

so i watched some ""lost"" at charlotte's...somewhat disappointing. everyone kept saying that the others were going to take the boy, and as per usual i knew who it was before it was revealed. walt, god what's wrong with the world, would you rather a baby who cries constantly? or a psychic....hmm. but ya, that was fun. 

steph is sleepy, and when she starts referring to herself in third person that means she's tired and needs to go to bed. so cheerio and farewell for now.

"event","i really suck at keeping these up to date...i'm terrible lol. picking up from my last post, i got my NLS, second time through sadly. i am currently awaiting to hear from Camp next wednesday to find out if i got the job (crosses fingers). a lot of you i will miss dearly if i get the job, but i'm sure you can understand that given the oppurtunity to be away from my parents for a long time i'm going to take it. we've entered the final stretch of the school year, mind you celeste is almost done (shakes fist) us public schoolers unfortunately have 2 weeks(?) left. currently i am involved in making another mask, exciting :D i love art that involves getting your hands in there...and no don't take that sexually please. physics is same old, chemistry is well...not positive cause i'm in the middle of a two day test, english is constant, and law is sitting lower than usual. exams are just around the corner, so i'm not the best person to be around i guess, i get sensitive and stuff cause im stressing and everything. social life is good, mind you i want to get away really badly, mostly cause im in exam mode...i hate this time makes me weird, i go from an extrovert to an introvert in ways. i hurt my ankle a long time ago...thought i might share that, i tore 3 ligaments. i would've preferred to break a bone cause now that the ligaments are healed they are scarred and it feels like something's squeezing me all the time. i'm still single though! lol, ya that hasn't changed. it's just weird i guess...i dunno it's hard to explain but i feel empty sometimes and then too full at others, really quite indecisive. school sucks socially, i wanna scream sometimes because i'm almost alone all day cause only 1 friend is in 1 class all day, and that's a class where there's no oppurtunity to talk, so ya...now i must finish off cause i'm sleepy and worried about school and my english project, i bid you adue...

"event","been a long time since i've used one of these. what can i say, i got a little bored and i don't really want to work on my physics project, so this happened. march break is not going to be a great one this year, NLS course all through the week, but in order to get the cash from the parents for driver's training, well, a deal had to be struck. so basically i pass NLS i get my g2, i dont pass NLS then i'll be waiting a long time before i can drive on my own...and that's not an option lol. my vacation for easter is also riding on whether i pass or not (sigh) it's gunna suck ass if i fail. ah well, school's not to shabby if i say so, law is a piece of cake, sitting at a 93% without studying at all. chemistry and physics are another matter though, god, you never know youre in the university level courses until your teacher practically hits you over the head, but chemistry is looking up since i did the 2nd quiz, physics'll be better once my project is handed in too. any ways, this was fun..."

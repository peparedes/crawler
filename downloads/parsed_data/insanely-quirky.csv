She was naturally confused, but found herself quite curious. This girl was different from her first visitor, while that dark haired girl was familiar, she did not make her feel quite like this.<br /><br />Like she was complete, even if she could not remember anything.<br /><br />Like she was home, even if home was such a foreign concept.<br /><br />She studied the way hazel eyes lit up with a smile after she did, before her lips formed a grin. Her hands itched to touch porcelain skin, her arms yearned to hold her close, her ears begged to hear the soft timbre of her voice. She wanted to know more, she wanted to know everything.<br /><br />Before she even knew what she was doing she had started to get up, ignoring the pain that enveloped her whole body until it was the only thing she could focus on, it was too intense, almost unbearable, she shuts her eyes and clenches her fists when everything started hurting too much.<br /><br />&quot;Breathe, just breathe,&quot;&nbsp;she tells herself.<br /><br />She opens her eyes and finds a worried face peering back at her. Anxiously watching her, gauging her reaction. She doesn&#39;t even know how she was once again on her back. But the girl seemed to be vibrating with worry. She bites her lip, wondering how she could express how remorseful she was to cause the other girl to worry. She opens her mouth to say something, stopping short as she was reminded of her unfortunate state.<br /><br />She couldn&#39;t speak.<br /><br />And to make things worse her visitor looked like she was just about to burst into tears, and she didn&#39;t know what she could do to stop it.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn couldn&#39;t believe it, she was awake and breathing, and alive and awake and was not just looking at her, she was smiling back.<br /><br />Belle was smiling back.<br /><br />She wouldn&#39;t have been able to stop the grin on her face even if she tried. And she kept on smiling at the small girl, even as she tried to calm her rapidly beating heart, that started doing somersaults and cartwheels when brown eyes studied her curiously. And just as she thought everything was finally winding down it starts up again as the smaller girl&#39;s brows furrow and her face scrunched in confusion. It was beyond adorable, and Quinn found herself melting at the display. She idly wonders how she was still standing when she could feel her knees buckle, and her legs shake. But all of that was forgotten when she sees the girl suddenly try and sit up, Quinn&#39;s heart leaps to her throat as the smaller girls face show pain. She moves to stop her from further sitting up. And gently helps her lie back down.<br /><br />She hovers over the girl, not really knowing what she could do. She watches as the beautiful face crumples in pain, then small hands clench into fists, and it took everything inside of her not to grab them in her own hands, to try and soothe her.<br /><br />It breaks her heart.<br /><br />She releases the breath she didn&#39;t know she was holding when Belle opened her eyes. But it failed to stop her heartbeat from pounding loudly in her ear. Her eyes flicker from one point to another, trying to find even a small twinge of pain from the other girl&#39;s face. She was worried, extremely so, that she was trembling.<br /><br />Their eyes meet, and Quinn wanted to console her, tell her things would turn out ok, only to stop herself when she sees the girl open her mouth to try and speak before promptly closing it again. And for a brief moment Quinn saw something, a sense of vulnerability, a twinge of despair, a dash of hopelessness. And it hurt, it hurt in a way she couldn&#39;t understand and it made her lips tremble.<br /><br />But she forgets all about that when Belle tries to sit up once again, albeit with much trepidation. Quinn spurs into action putting a restraining hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder.<br /><br />&quot;Don&#39;t try and get up,&quot; she whispers trying to get the girl to lie back down, &quot;You&#39;ll hurt if you don&#39;t lie back down,&quot; she adds.<br /><br />The girl looks at her for what seems like hours, before she once again tries to sit up, fists clenched, face ashen.<br /><br />&quot;Please, just stay still ok,&quot; pleads Quinn, &quot;I&#39;ll help you, just don&#39;t move ok,&quot; she adds keeping her eyes on the girl, she blindly gropes for the bed remote, then presses the appropriate button to raise the top part up.<br /><br />She watches as Belle jerks a bit, startled as the bed starts moving. Once again wincing in pain.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s ok, just trust me ok,&quot; she brings the remote up in between them, &quot;See, I&#39;m just using the remote to help you sit up.&quot;<br /><br />The other girl&#39;s eyes widen, glancing to her left then right before finding Quinn&#39;s eyes again, the smaller girl gives her a beaming smile now that she was upright.<br /><br />Quinn for her part places the remote beside the girl&#39;s hand, &quot;Better?&quot; she asks, smiling as Belle nods her head.<br /><br />She smiles, watching as the brunette lift the remote in front of her inspecting it curiously. She presses the same button that Quinn had pressed instantly letting it go when the bed moves again. Quinn chuckles at this and receives a grin, before the smaller girl goes back to inspecting the remote turning it around, and tracing each button.<br /><br />The look of joy on Belle&#39;s face left Quinn in awe. She was left breathless as she watched the girl, innocently press buttons and smile softly at each discovery. And it was so precious, that Quinn couldn&#39;t help the giggle that escaped her lips.<br /><br />&quot;So adorably cute,&quot; she whispers, before turning bright red, the small girl was looking at her just as red, &quot;Sorry,&quot; she murmurs stopping before she could say more, voice hitching as a small hand clasps hers.<br /><br />&quot;Hi,&quot; she says, smiling shyly, &quot;You must think that I&#39;m the biggest dork you&#39;ve ever met huh?&quot; she adds ducking her head, a tug on her hand makes her look up, and the small girl shrugs her shoulders gently..<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure you would say otherwise if I told you how I talked to you the whole time you were unconscious,&quot; she says once again looking down, tracing patterns across the bed sheet, switching from one foot to another, &quot;And I pretty much told you my life story,&quot; she trails off, once again looking down, catching sight of their still joined hands.<br /><br />It takes a minute or so for Quinn to once again remember her manners, internally face-palming at her forgetfulness.<br /><br />&quot;I already did this while you were unconscious, and I told you then that once you were awake I&#39;d do it again,&quot; she says with a shy smile before letting go of the softest hand she&#39;d ever held, &quot;My name is Quinn, Quinn Fabray. And I wanted to thank you for saving my life,&quot; she says extending her hand out.<br /><br />The small girl nods her head, brows crinkled in what seemed to be confusion, looking at the hand extended towards her. And all Quinn could do was look from her outstretched hand to the confused girl in the bed, before smiling when she sees the other girl extend her hand as well, not taking hers. So Quinn takes it upon herself to take the smaller hand in hers, shaking it slowly. A snort escaping her body at the beaming smile the other girl gave her. Their eyes meet, and just like the first time, Quinn felt a sense of deja vu. Her breath catches in her throat and she marvels at all the feelings this beautiful girl causes.<br /><br />&quot;My angel,&quot; she whispers to herself, inherently knowing how perfect it sounded.<br /><br />They stayed like that eyes locked, hands clasped until a rapid succession of gentle knocks came from the door, prompting both girls to turn their heads. Quinn starts moving towards the door stopping short when she feels her hand being squeezed, and then being tugged back towards the bed.<br /><br />Belle looked anxious, worried even and Quinn quickly placates the smaller girl, &quot;It&#39;s ok,&quot; she murmurs, her thumb massaging the hand she held in her own, &quot;It&#39;s just my best friend Brittany, I told her I wouldn&#39;t take too long,&quot; she adds takes a quick look back at the door before locking eyes with Belle.<br /><br />What she sees makes her want to giggle and coo all at the same time, the smaller girl was pouting, and it was the cutest thing Quinn had ever seen.<br /><br />&quot;I probably have a couple more minutes until I have to go,&quot; she says, &quot;But I&#39;ll be right back, I promise.&quot;<br /><br />This makes the smaller girl pout more, pulling away her hand, and crossing both arms across her chest, wincing a bit. Quinn couldn&#39;t stop the small laugh that escaped even if she wanted to.<br /><br />&quot;God you are way too precious for words,&quot; she exclaims trying to catch Belle&#39;s eyes with her own, once successful, she offers both her hands and smiles as tanned hands connect with hers, &quot;I just kind of sneaked in your room, and I&#39;m supposed to be resting too,&quot; she confesses, squeezing Belle&#39;s hands just a bit when she feels her pulling away, &quot;I just really needed to see you with my own eyes, the conscious moving you that is,&quot; she adds.<br /><br />Belle looks straight at her a faint blush painting her cheeks, and they gaze at each other until Brittany&#39;s muffled voice comes through the door.<br /><br />&quot;Q! We gotta go, mom&#39;s asking where we went.&quot;<br /><br />Hazel eyes refused to move as she answers, her response laced with disdain. There was a pull, a certain feeling in her chest that refused to let her savior out of her sight, afraid that once she didn&#39;t have the other girl in front of her, she would find her gone. The thought evoked a feeling of loss so acute, she had to bite down on her lower lip to stop the tears she knew would fall down her face.<br /><br />The fact that said girl was looking at her with teary eyes as well did not help in making her make a quick departure. She vaguely wonders why she was feeling the way she currently did, when she barely knew this person, aside from deducing that said person saved her life, she knew nothing about her that would explain the sense of belonging and completeness she felt in her presence. The same feeling that surrounded her and somewhat grounded her the whole time they were on the road, as she searched for help and conversed with the then unconscious girl.<br /><br />Deciding that she had time to figure it out much later, Quinn instead started focusing on making Belle understand that she would come back as soon as she possibly could.<br /><br />&quot;I wish I could stay, I really do. But I need to go back to my room before my mother starts panicking thinking my father found me again,&quot; she says gently, heart breaking as a tear trickles down Belle&#39;s sun kissed skin, she wipes it away with her thumb cradling her cheek, &quot;I promise I&#39;ll come back and I won&#39;t leave until they make me,&quot; she adds with a soft smile trying to convey her sincerity and the truth behind her words, &quot;And everyone will attest that a Quinn Fabray promise is as good as a guarantee.&quot;<br /><br />And as the smaller girl nods in understanding, Quinn finds herself grinning in relief, joy and unabashed admiration.<br /><br />&quot;You&#39;re a very brave person did you know that, trusting too,&quot; she says letting go of Belle&#39;s face, &quot;before I go, I just wanted to ask for one thing,&quot; she adds a burst of nervous energy spreading across her body.<br /><br />Belle looking at her, but with an emotion she couldn&#39;t quite place giving her the boost she needed to finally ask.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />She didn&#39;t want Quinn to go, just the thought of it made her cold and alone. She didn&#39;t need to know who she was to figure out that this girl, Quinn Fabray made her feel safe, made her feel grounded, made her believe that everything wads going to be alright.<br /><br />She couldn&#39;t stop looking at her, eyes tracing the curve of Quinn&#39;s cheeks, down the angle of her jaw, the way her lips quirked upward, her perfectly arched eyebrows, and finally her eyes. Those hazel eyes with just the perfect amount of green and golden flecks, dancing with happiness and uncertainty.<br /><br />Her arm lifts up on it&#39;s own accord, her hand resting on a pair of frazzled ones, a pair that settles down after being wringed over and over again with anxiousness.<br /><br /><i>what is it?</i>&nbsp;she wanted to say,&nbsp;<i>what one thing?&nbsp;</i>her mind screamed.<br /><br />She didn&#39;t have to wait too long, and it takes everything inside of her to stop herself from giggling at how flustered Quinn was.<br /><br />&quot;I ummm,&quot; she starts to say, &quot;umm, well I,&quot; Quinn&#39;s voice trails off, &quot;I just wanted to ask,&quot; Quinn tries again groaning cutely when she was unable to just blurt it out.<br /><br />She smiles at this squeezing the hands beneath her own, grinning at the appearance of a small smile that was on Quinn&#39;s face.<br /><br />She waits as Quinn takes a deep breath and says, &quot;Belle, I wanted to know if I could hug you.&quot;<br /><br />It was more of a whisper but she heard it clearly, and as much as she wanted to agree, she instead was stuck on the fact that Quinn had called her Belle.<br /><br /><i>is that my name? is she someone who knows who I am?</i><br /><br />&quot;I just, I know you don&#39;t know who I am Belle, and well I don&#39;t know you well either, but I just really wanted to give you a hug, as a thank you, which now that I&#39;ve thought about it sounds really lame,&quot; Quinn rambles who showed no signs of stopping anytime soon.<br /><br /><i>We don&#39;t know each other but you call me Belle? is that my name? It doesn&#39;t feel like my name</i><br /><br />&quot;But it&#39;s the best I can offer for now, I don&#39;t really have any way to repay your kindness and for a lack of a better term heroism.&quot;<br /><br /><i>I know you mentioned that I saved your life, but how exaclty did I do that?</i><br /><br />&quot;And you know you could totally say no, if you don&#39;t want me to. If I&#39;m like being all over your personal space just let me know and I&#39;ll back off...Belle?&quot;<br /><br /><i>I&#39;m so confused<br />who am I?</i><br /><br />&quot;Did I say something to upset you?&quot; Quinn asks.<br /><br />A shrug and a sniffle was the answer.<br /><br />This mortifies Quinn who exclaims, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I assumed it would be ok to ask for a hug, I feel so stupid for asking. Of course you wouldn&#39;t be fine with it, I&#39;m practically a stranger.&quot;<br /><br />She shakes her head at this, she clutches one of Quinn&#39;s hands in a desperate need to catch her attention, once hazel eyes find hers, a frown mars her features in utter disdain for her inability to communicate. She looks at Quinn and with teary eyes points at herself.<br /><br />&quot;Umm, I don&#39;t,&quot; Quinn says obviously confused.<br /><br />She huffs not knowing how to get her point across, a second or so later she points at Quinn.<br /><br />Prompting Quinn to ask, &quot;Me?&quot; earning a nod. She then points to herself, &quot;You,&quot; answers Quinn, and once again she gets a nod followed by a finger pointing back at her.<br /><br />&quot;Umm Quinn?&quot; Quinn asks, as everything was finally clicking into place. And as she pointed at herself, Quinn&#39;s eyes widen, &quot;Oh gosh! I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she exclaims apologetically, &quot;I called you Belle,&quot; she adds.<br /><br />The smaller girl nods her head.<br /><i>Yes! You did</i>, she thinks to herself,&nbsp;<i>You called me Belle but insist that we are strangers, when you don&#39;t feel like one.</i><br /><br />&quot;While I was driving, looking for help for both of us, I just didn&#39;t want to call you hey. And once I started talking to you I just decided to call you Belle, from this cartoon. She was brave and she was beautiful, and I just thought that it fit. I decided I would call you Belle until I learned your name. And now I feel like an ass for calling you by that name when the doctors said that you well, that you were,&quot; Quinn trails off not knowing how to say it without sounding mean.<br /><br />Her shoulders slump, and she wraps her arms around herself, feeling a twinge of pain from her shoulder blades and back, a small sound of discomfort leaving her lips.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she hears Quinn mumble, &quot;Do you want me to call you something else?&quot;<br /><br />She shakes her head, &lt;i&gt;<i>What else would you call me, I don&#39;t know anything</i>.&lt;i&gt;<br /><br />&quot;How about I call you Belle for now, and when I come back I help you with your real one?&quot; was all Quinn could say, hoping it would make up for her obvious blunder.<br /><br />She shrugs, wincing once again in discomfort.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m really sorry,&quot; Quinn whispers, &quot;I should go, I&#39;ve probably overstepped on my self imposed welcome,&quot; She watches as Quinn gets up from her seated position obviously on her way to make a quick exit. Not wanting to let the blonde go just yet, she grabs unto the taller girl&#39;s shirt. Quinn looks at her with a questioning gaze, and she just keeps pulling at the shirt until they were almost side by side.<br /><br />She finally lets go of Quinn&#39;s shirt, and looks at the blonde. Waiting for her to ask again.<br /><br />&quot;Is it ok,&quot; Quinn starts, voice a bit shaky, &quot;Would it be ok if I hugged you?&quot;<br /><br />She gives Quinn a small nod, and she was given a small smile in return. She watched as Quinn moved closer, felt a gentle hand graze her shoulders, while Quinn&#39;s other arm wraps around her lower back. Her arms wraps around Quinn&#39;s waist and she rests her head on Quinn&#39;s shoulder, she feels Quinn&#39;s chin on the top of her head. She closes her eyes and just stays in the moment, and beneath her ear, she could hear Quinn&#39;s heartbeat strong and steady. Beating in time with hers, when something flashes<br />behind her closed eyes.<br /><br /><b><i>&quot;I can hear your heart, Angel, it&#39;s like mine,&quot; was softly garbled by a sleepy child&#39;s voice, And her arms holds the small blonde closer.</i></b><br /><br />Her arms squeeze Quinn tighter it was so familiar, like something she had seen or maybe a memory from her past, and before she could think about it more she hears the other girl whisper &quot;Dibs.&quot;<br /><br />The room was still, and as they held each other, everything else seemed inconsequential. Outside the sun was bright, the wind breezed through but in that sterile hospital room. The two girls were locked in an embrace and eveything was forgotten.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn, we really gotta go,&quot; rang Brittany&#39;s insistent voice.<br /><br />Arms withdrew from its locked state, both girl reluctantly lets go. And for a brief moment, all the smaller girl could think about was how right it felt, how that hug reminded her of a past that was hidden from her reach. She shakes her head and sighs as Quinn stood in front of her, looking as if all she wanted was to stay right there. Here with her.<br /><br />&quot;I really have to go now,&quot; Quinn says, &quot;But I promise I&#39;ll be back, maybe I can convince my mom and the others to have lunch here instead,&quot; she adds, &quot;If you were ok with it?&quot;<br /><br />Wanting to see her again, she nods her head in earnest, smiling just a little at the prospect of being around the girl. It was definitely a good idea.<br /><br />&quot;Awesome, I&#39;ll be back with a few people. People that would more or less hug you too,&quot; she says with a chuckle, &quot;They&#39;re weird like that,&quot; says Quinn, as she walks backwards, &quot;And I&#39;ll bring you some green Jello, somehow that always makes me feel better, Oh and Ice Cream, I&#39;ll bring some Ice Cream too!&quot; she exclaims before hitting the door, &quot;Ooof, ouch. Umm yeah, I&#39;m going to go now before I embarass myself further or you know hide in the closet or something from shame,&quot; she rambles, grabbing the door handle from behind her, &quot;I&#39;ll see you later ok? yeah ok, umm later alligator.&quot;<br /><br />All of this happened in a span of a minute or so, and all she could do was giggle, she looks out the window and saw the clear blue sky and she feels happy. She was alone, she was unable to speak, and she knew nothing about herself. But with Quinn around, it didn&#39;t feel as bad as it did when she first woke up. With Quinn around everything was just better.<br /><br />A thud against the door, makes her look back at the door. She wonders what it was, but when nothing else happens, she looks back out the window and stares at the sky. She was going to meet Quinn&#39;s family,&nbsp; she wonders if her first visitor was that for her.&nbsp; She looks behind her and spies another black rectangle object, with lots of buttons. She reaches for it and pushes random ones and was startled when sounds and moving pictures appear on the box attached to the cieling.<br /><br /><i>Wow, it looks real.</i>&nbsp;she thinks to herself.<br /><br />She presses a couple of more buttons and watches as the moving pictures change from one thing to another.<br /><br /><i>This is wow</i>.<br /><br />She keeps on pressing the button that made the pictures change until she saw a woman in orange carrying yellow flowers and a suitcase walking and singing at the same time. She lets go of the rectangle thing, and watches in awe.<br /><br />&nbsp;<b><u>I&#39;ll march my band out, I&#39;ll beat my drum</u></b>&nbsp;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />The door softly clicks shut behind her and she in turn leans against the closed door. She sees Brittany watching her curiously as she sighs heavily. Their gazes catch, and she she knew that Brittany would ask her questions she really didn&#39;t want to answer right at that moment. So she turns around and lets her forehead touch the door.<br /><br />&quot;So how&#39;d it go Q, was she awake? is she ok? did you guys talk?&quot; Brittany asks in rapid succession.<br /><br />There were a lot of questions, and she really didn&#39;t want to answer any of them, still feeling like the biggest idiot for calling Belle, well Belle when they obviously didn&#39;t know each other, and most importantly the actual girl didn&#39;t really know who she really was. So Instead of answering she let&#39;s out a groan thumping her head against the door a little harder than she anticipated.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Jeez Q, it was just a few questions, no need to hurt yourself,&quot; she hears Brittany right behind her, as said girl grabs her shoulder dragging her backwards before turning her round so they were face to face. &quot;You ok?&quot; Brittany asks.<br /><br />Quinn shrugs her shoulders while one hand rubs her forehead, sneaking a peek at the closed door, while sporting the look of a scolded kicked puppy. She hears Brittany whisper to herself, &quot;Oh&quot; making her face front and scowl. Her eyebrows move closer together when she sees her friend struggling to keep her giggles to herself, &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; she asks &nbsp;incredulously. She huffs and lifts an eyebrow when instead of words, she hears Brittany giggle before grabbing her hand then dragging her away, &quot;Brittany! I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s so funny!&quot; she exclaims then turning bright red when one of the orderly shushes them&nbsp;&nbsp;as she passed them by<br /><br />Brittany turns to look at her smiling widely, &quot;You&#39;re the one whose funny Quinn,&quot; she tells her friend, &quot;And we really need to get back to your room before everyone starts looking for you.&quot;<br /><br />And that answer was not enough for Quinn, who starts tugging on Brittany&#39;s hand to stall her movement, &quot;No, we&#39;re not going anywhere until you tell me what was so funny,&quot; she says grumpily, pulling her hand away from Brittany&#39;s grasp to cross both arms across her chest.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s coz I know that look,&quot; Brittany says, eyes full of mirth as she keeps their eyes locked, &quot;And with that look and you being like this means you did something very Quinnish, and you don&#39;t like being seen as an adorable dork&quot; she adds moving closer to her friend, &quot;What happened Q?&quot;<br /><br />Quinn drops her gaze and sighs, she&#39;s always had these quirk that everyone finds adorable, and often times it comes up at the worst possible opportunity. So when she started talking and kept talking there was no way to stop it. She still couldn&#39;t believe she called Belle by Belle when it wasn&#39;t even her name. The girl probably thought she was a weird clingy, stalker type insensitive dolt and would probably have her and everyone she knew banned from coming back. &lt;i&gt; I&#39;ll never see her again&lt;i&gt; runs through her mind making her tear up a little. Which in turn alerts her best friend.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn, what happened?&quot; she asks softly.<br /><br />Quinn covers her face with her hands before giving a muffled reply, &quot;I&#39;m a Jerk, she&#39;ll never want to see me again.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh Quinn, you could never be a Jerk,&quot; Brittany retorts, &quot;even on your worst day you&#39;d never be able to pull it off,&quot; she adds.<br /><br />&quot;Well I was an idiot then, a stupid bumbling idiot!&quot; exclaims Quinn exasperatedly, &quot;There is no way that she&#39;ll want to see me again after what I did.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;What exactly happened?&quot;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;I completely forgot that she had amnesia, and that she was more or less mute, and I just kept talking and talking, and kept calling her Belle, and you should have seen how sad she was Brittany, how confused and lost. I was just so insensitive and so stupid when I kept calling her Belle and just went on and on about wanting a hug, and what I talked about while I was trying to find help, and I now that all of that is over and done with I just feel really really stupid.&quot;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;You&#39;re not stupid, I should totally know right?&quot; negates Brittany, &quot; And if this girl was already told what happened I bet she&#39;d understand.

She&#39;s going to come home with us?&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;If Holly and the Police gives us the all clear, yes she&#39;ll be coming home with us. And you and Brittany should help her feel as comfortable as possible,&quot; she adds.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">In a span of mere seconds, Brittany had Quinn in her arms, and they were twirling and jumping around in circles, only stopping when Alexis cleared her throat, Quinn whips her head round to find her sister&#39;s knowing gaze, &quot;I thought you said something about ice cream and Jell-O, I demand that you find some immediately,&quot; she says with a certain air of superiority, she guffaws as Quinn&#39;s eyebrows rise, &quot;Oh don&#39;t even try I invented that eyebrow thing, besides the baby wants some.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">And as quick as they arrived, the younger girls were gone, throwing a we&#39;ll be right back with Mr Berry 1 and 2, who was currently in the lobby surveying the choices in the vending machines.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;Now that the kids are gone, we can all be adults,&quot; Alexis starts, &quot;Is this really a good idea? putting them together, I&#39;m all for it especially if this girl really is orphaned, and I think being a foster mom is an amazing&nbsp;endeavor&nbsp;mom don&#39;t get me wrong. But is this even safe? and will this actually help this girl? We&#39;re basically strangers, both ways. And what if dad comes back, for both of them.&quot; she continues, shuddering at the thought of her father getting close to Quinn, to her family all over again, she never wants it to happen again.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;The police have been going over the one cabin to another along the same area as yours, trying to find anyone who might know this girl,&quot; Holly starts, &quot;The press were under strict orders to only release the fact that Quinn was now safe, and that your father was still at large, and nothing about the girl was mentioned. But we are trying to find her family, but until we do, she can&#39;t stay here. She shouldn&#39;t stay here. And the doctors think that being around Quinn would help her remember, or at least feel safe, And I agree, if she reacts positively to Quinn then we&#39;re all good, so to speak.&quot;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">Judy stands only to sit beside her oldest daughter who for as long as she could remember tried to protect them, protected Quinn as much as she could. So she takes her daughter in her arms, &quot;Honey, I understand, I really do. But I have a good feeling about this, even if it was caused by something so horrific, I just feel like this is something I should do ok?&quot; she asks as her voice was a bit muffled by her daughters head, &quot;If it weren&#39;t for the friends we met along the way, we&#39;d never be where we are now. I just want to be able to give back,&quot; she adds eyes locked with Holly&#39;s, who just gives her a teary smile, Judy smiles a little bit wider, when Alexis just nods her head before burrowing deeper into her mother&#39;s embrace.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">-o-o-o-o-</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">An hour or so later, Quinn finds herself standing in front of the same door she head butted. She idly wonders if the door would hit her back if it were alive. She stays stuck on the same space not really paying attention to the doctor who is currently talking to Holly and her mother. She was just really, really wanted to open the door and see Belle again, and at the same time she was dreading actually opening the door. That decision was taken away from her when the doctor knocks on the door once, twice then thrice in rapid succession before opening the door, gesturing for them to follow. She was hoping that Brittany was with them right now, but the doctor mentioned that the fewer people the better, for now anyway. Before she knew it her mother&#39;s hand was on her arm, and she was the last one in the line of people entering the brunette&#39;s room.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;Hi there,&quot; she hears the doctor say, &quot;I brought a few friends with me and one special guest,&quot; he adds.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">Quinn once again doesn&#39;t pay attention. Instead she finds herself smiling at the beaming girl whose eyes were sparkling like the sun. She really doesn&#39;t know what comes over her, but she lifts up her arm, the same arm holding a bag of most probably melted ice cream and proceeds to wave, swaying the bag from one side to the other, hitting her face.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;Ouch!&quot; she exclaims, before flushing guiltily at all the worried glances thrown her way, &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m ok!&quot; she says putting the offending bag on the table, before rubbing on the sore spot on her face, while her eyes stay glued on the giggling brunette on the bed, she spies her lift an arm and wave back. And she just smiles. She keeps on smiling as the doctor excuses himself to tend to his other patients, she keeps smiling as she watches Holly introduce herself, then her mother, and smiles wider as Holly mentions her name and was rewarded with a big mega watt smile and another wave.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><b><i><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">so cute!</span></i></b></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">She keeps on smiling as Holly talks about what was going to happen, she keeps smiling even as she picks up random facts here and there.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><b><i><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">Cool, we&#39;re like the same age more or less.</span></i></b></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">She keeps smiling as she watches the small girl, nod then frown and nod, then smile tentatively, throwing quick&nbsp;glances to Holly then her mother, then a shy glance at her.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><b><i><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">I hope she&#39;s ok with this.</span></i></b></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">She barely paid attention as her mother starts speaking, she was sure her mom mentioned her once or twice, she wasn&#39;t really keeping count.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><b><i><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">I hope she likes the ice cream, oh shit the ice cream.</span></i></b></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;I brought Ice Cream like I promised,&quot; bursts out of her mouth before she could think, and she sees her mother look at her in wonder, and Holly just laugh in amusement. But the most important thing of all, was Belle. And Belle, well she was smiling, just smiling at her. And that made all the difference. For a moment everything just stopped and started back up again, she barely hears Holly say something about Brittany, and her mother mentions getting some cups, or forks? why would they need forks. Spoons! her mother mentioned spoons.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">Then they were alone. And Quinn was at a loss for words. Again. She lifts one arm to rub the back of her neck and hits her stomach with another bag instead.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; she exclaims excitedly, &quot;Mr Berry 2 &nbsp;was with me when I bought this, and he said it might be good idea as a way for us to talk and stuff and well I guess it is. We kind of talked about him while I was driving around, but uh, you&#39;ll meet him later along with Mr. Berry 1 and everyone else.&quot; she says while pulling one thing after the other from inside of another plastic bag, &quot;The doctor already told us that you weren&#39;t talking and well, this is one we can communicate,&quot; she adds before showing a white board, some markers and an eraser, &quot;Here, we can try that,&quot; she walks closer towards the smaller girl, before offering the newly procured merchandise.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">She watches as Belle uncaps one pen sniffs it and frowns, and she couldn&#39;t stop the giggle that escapes her after that, Belle smirking at her really didn&#39;t help the situation. Quinn watches as she writes something, only to erase it and try again. The whole process was on repeat. Before finally Belle turns the board round.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><i><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">Hi Quinn! I was hoping you&#39;d come back, thank you.</span></i></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">She was about to reply, when her mother comes back in with Brittany in tow. And a few spoons and cups on hand.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;So who&#39;s ready for some melted ice cream?&quot; her mother asks, &quot;Also this is Brittany and she wanted to bring you the Jell-O that Quinn left behind,&quot; she adds with a wink thrown at the brunette, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure she was just excited to see you.&quot;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">The smaller girl giggles at that, and start scribbling on the board again, and all Quinn could do was frown at her mother and grab a spoon, open the tub of ice cream and start serving.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><i><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">It&#39;s nice to meet you.

She instead focuses on dishing out the ice cream, passing each occupant of the room a cup before plopping herself at the end corner of the bed. She more or less sulks, until she feels a foot nudge her knee. She looks up and finds Belle look at her pointedly before pointing at her face and smiling wide, then pointing to the cup of ice cream on hand.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">After that the room was filled with laughter, Judy excuses herself to talk with Holly about more paperwork, and Brittany follows a few seconds later stating she wanted some water. Both Quinn and Belle, look at the full pitcher on the bedside table, Belle looks at the door, then back to Quinn a question clearly showing on her face, and Quinn just shrugs her shoulders not really knowing what to say. A few minutes later, Quinn takes a deep breath before starting to talk.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">&quot;I&#39;m really sorry about you know, before,&quot; she says,&quot;And I just wanted say sorry again,&quot; she continues and could only watch as the girl grabs the board and pen. The smaller girl starts write and write and write. It felt like forever before she saw what was on that board.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><i><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">You don&#39;t have to keep apologizing Quinn, I to a certain degree understand. And somehow after watching copious amounts of moving pictured from that mounted box on the ceiling that there are far worse problems in the world, than the one currently have. My no recollection of who I am and where I&#39;m from is but a&nbsp;minuscule little thing compared to famine, and war and&nbsp;incurable&nbsp;terminal diseases. My having amnesia is not your fault, I am pretty certain for some reason that this was all my doing, that was indirectly caused by my attempt to save you. So please, don&#39;t apologize. Let&#39;s just move on from this and yes this means I would like to take you up on your offer to help me figure out my name, and even a temporary one.&nbsp;</span></i></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">Quinn takes it all in, and even has to squint more than once to make sure she was reading everything right before lifting her head up, &quot;Oh--OK.&quot; was all Quinn could say.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><b><i><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">Wow, ummm yeah, wow.</span></i></b></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""></p><p style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;"">TBC</span></p><p>hope you liked it.</p>"

She desperately tries to catch Sue&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Tell me she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was Sue&rsquo;s whispered command, knowing full well what it would mean otherwise.<br /><br />She tries to remain stoic, but her voice tremble as she answers, &ldquo;I tried to stop her coach, I really did. But she&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t listen, she wanted me to make it back here.&rdquo;<br /><br />Carl kneels beside them, grabbing Santana&rsquo;s hand making her focus on him in return, &ldquo;Was it everything?&rdquo; he asks his demeanor changing with every word.<br /><br />And Santana&rsquo;s answer changes everything, &ldquo;If it was, I wouldn&rsquo;t be connected to her would I?&rdquo;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn keeps staring at her wrist, tracing a pattern only she sees. She could vaguely hear someone call her name, she lifts her head up and sees the same police officer from the cruiser.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ms Fabray,&rdquo; he says softly, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we get you checked out,&rdquo; he adds extending out his hand for her to take.<br /><br />She looks at his face and his gentle smile, &ldquo;Can I call my mom first? I need her to know I found help and my phone died awhile back,&rdquo; she tells him as she clasps his offered limb in her smaller one. And he helps her up and immediately let&rsquo;s go of her hand once she was on her feet.<br /><br />&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a phone you can use somewhere,&rdquo; was his reply as he leads her towards the nurse&rsquo;s station, &ldquo;Hi, can we use your phone?&rdquo; he asks one of the nurses. With a nod she hands over the phone and Quinn proceeds to dial a familiar number.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ringing,&rdquo; she tells him before biting her lip in anticipation, &ldquo;Hi Mom, Lexi. I made it I&rsquo;m at Mercy Hospital in Westerville, and right now I&rsquo;m about to get checked out. I don&rsquo;t know how she is they whisked her away as soon as we got here, I&rsquo;ll see you guys here. I love you.&rdquo; She ends the call and places the phone back in its cradle, before looking at the police officer, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably on their way like they said they would be,&rdquo; she tells him.<br /><br />He nods his head once, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get your exam out of the way, and when your mom gets here I can get your statement,&rdquo; he tells her as he leads her to an exam room.<br /><br />&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Quinn whispers right after she had launched herself at the unsuspecting police officer, &ldquo;Thank you so much sir,&rdquo; she says again as she pulled away before turning around to smile at nurse in the room. She wonders why in this room full of strangers, she felt more at ease than in a room with her father. She thinks about &lsquo;Belle&rsquo; praying that she was being taken care of, that she was going to be ok.<br /><br />The nurse directs her to sit on the bed, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started ok Hon?&rdquo; she hears her say. She gives the older lady with a smile, and tries hard to pay attention to what&rsquo;s happening during her exam, and she answers all the questions the best way she could.<br /><br />At one point during her exam, a doctor came in and started asking her questions. Quinn was pretty sure she was able to answer them as best she could, but her mind kept straying to that small girl who had saved her life. She wondered if she would even be told of her condition. If someone was out there worried about her, if there was someone looking for her.<br /><br />Quinn had no idea how long she&rsquo;d been sitting there, she doesn&rsquo;t even remember how many out dated magazines she&rsquo;d leafed through. All she knew was that no one had approached since she sat back down on the surprisingly comfortable seats.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s been trying to read the article on the page she had stopped on, she&rsquo;d gotten as far as the first sentence, when she vaguely hears her name being called. She lifts her head before taking off running.<br /><br />&ldquo;Mommy,&rdquo; she cries clinging to her mother, &ldquo;Mommy you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she whimpers both hands clutching her unto her mother&rsquo;s shirt. She could hear her mother whispering words of comfort, but it all went over her head, she could pay attention to them later, she just wanted to melt in her mother&rsquo;s safe embrace. She keeps her arms wrapped around her, taking in the feel of her, inhaling the scent of her, it was that last reminder that she needed. She was safe, she was with her mother, she was home.<br /><br />She feels a hand on her head, gentle fingers running through her hair, forcing her to lift her head from the her mother&rsquo;s neck, her eyes find familiar hazel ones. Eyes brimming with tears, relief, worry and joy evident in them, &ldquo;Lexi,&rdquo; she croaks, before heaving sobs wrack her body, her mother lets her go long enough for her sister to take her place, pregnant belly cradled in between them.<br /><br />She knew words were being said, her name and prayers of thanks falling from their lips. Their hands never idle, always touching, her arms, her hands, and her head or wiping away her tears, tucking her hair behind her ear. If they weren&rsquo;t speaking she&rsquo;d feel their lips on her forehead, on her cheek, on the back of her head. <br /><br />At one point, she knew her mother directed them to the couch, she knew she had soaked her sister&rsquo;s shirt with her tears and she knew that she was clutching their hands as tight as she could, the same way they clutched hers. And she knew, she finally knew that she was safe. She really made it out. She found her way home.<br /><br />Everyone else in the room could only watch the joyous reunion unfold as the three women clung to each other. Everyone knew that what they saw was either a miracle, or close to one as they could get.<br /><br />Everyone there could only wish that this was the last time this family had to go through anything like this again.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Holly sat in her home office, staring off into space. She kept thinking of what&rsquo;s been happening all around her, kept thinking of what her role really was in all of it.  her ringing phone startles her, and she quickly picks it up, hoping for good news, somehow knowing what she was about to hear just that, &ldquo;Hello, Oh Judy you are? That&rsquo;s good to hear. Yes, I&rsquo;ll let them know right away, I&rsquo;ll go grab it right now, yes we&rsquo;ll see you all soon, take care,&rdquo; ending the call she runs her hand through her hair, &ldquo;Why does it feel like something big is about to happen?&rdquo; she asks out loud. <br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Judy sat back down beside Quinn, putting one arm around her baby, &ldquo;I just called Holly, I&rsquo;m pretty sure we can expect everyone in a few hours,&rdquo; She softly tells her girls as a content smile blossoms on her face as Quinn cuddles closer to her, she gives her forehead a kiss and catches her Alexis&rsquo; eyes who was gently smiling at the scene.<br /><br />A nurse walks towards them, and Quinn sits up straight before trailing the nurse&rsquo;s movement before visibly deflating as said nurse just passes them by, she snuggles back into her mother&rsquo;s side, moving ever so often until finding the perfect position. She sighs happily before tensing up.<br /><br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong Baby?&rdquo; Judy asks, Quinn instead of answering burrows further into Judy&rsquo;s arms, &ldquo;Quinny,&rdquo; prompts Judy.<br /><br />Quinn untangles herself from her mother&rsquo;s arms, biting her lip, &ldquo;Do you think&hellip;&rdquo;, she starts glancing at the double doors where the girl was rushed through, &ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;ll be ok? That she is ok?&rdquo; She asks, &ldquo;Will they tell us how she is, do you think she has a mom and sister worried about her too?&rdquo; Quinn continues forehead scrunched, emotions running wild inside of her, the thought of Belle being alone worrying her, &ldquo;Can we help her get home? Can we stay here until she&rsquo;s ok?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay squirt,&rdquo; Says Alexis, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay as long as you want.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; says Quinn as her eyes grow heavy, she tries to snuggle back into her mother but instead almost falls face first if not for Judy&rsquo;s arms wrapping around her middle. She knows she was asked a question, she tells her mother what she feels instead, &ldquo;Mommy, mm tired,&rdquo; she mumbles before everything goes black.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&ldquo;Hi, we&rsquo;re here to see Quinn Fabray,&rdquo; Holly tells the nurse in front of her, who takes one look at her and her &lsquo;entourage&rsquo; : The Berrys and her darling daughter, worrying her lip while clutching Mr. Lambchop to her body tightly.<br /><br />&ldquo;They&rsquo;re over here,&rdquo; the nurse tells them leading them over a hallway, before stopping at one door, &ldquo;The poor thing was so exhausted she just conked out, we&rsquo;ve been trying to tell her to rest up, but stubbornly refused to leave the waiting area until she knew how the girl she came in with was,&rdquo;  she says adds nodding her head towards one door where an officer stood guarding it, &ldquo;You can go and visit but I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;re all asleep in there,&rdquo; she continues, before moving back towards her station.<br /><br />&ldquo;What of the other girl, the one Quinn came with?&rdquo; asks Hiram.<br /><br />The nurse looks from side to side, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir, I can only release her status to family members or if applicable legal guardians,&rdquo; she gives them a sad smile before leaving.<br /><br />Brittany doesn&rsquo;t waste any time and opens the door and quickly makes her way inside, &ldquo;Q?&rdquo; she whispers, when she finds everyone in the room asleep, she quietly walks over Quinn&rsquo;s bedside, before putting Mr. Lambchop in her best friend&rsquo;s arms, &ldquo;We were worried about you Q,&rdquo; she murmurs, smiling as Quinn grabs on to Mr. Lambchop tighter, she leans forward and kisses Quinn&rsquo;s forehead before turning around to sit beside her mother, who sat with a now awake Judy, she gives her a tight hug before she watches the berry men, fidget beside Quinn&rsquo;s sleeping form.<br /><br />&ldquo;Has anyone said anything about the other girl?&rdquo; Holly asks Judy, who just shakes her head, &ldquo;Not even the detectives or attending?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;The young  man outside, told me that the lead detective will be by in an hour or so, they&rsquo;re at the cabin checking it out, and as for the other girl, she appears to be a minor, and that he can&rsquo;t say anything else,&rdquo; was Judy&rsquo;s answer, before standing to accept the hugs that the Berrys wanted to give.<br /><br />Holly catches her daughter&rsquo;s eyes before giving a barely noticeable nod, she&rsquo;d take care of it. She stands up, letting them know she had to make a call, she had a feeling her hunch was correct, but she just had to make sure.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Holly walks up to the hospital roof and just stood for awhile, and wasn&rsquo;t surprised to hear the voice coming from behind her.<br /><br />&ldquo;The Big Boss wanted you to know, all that should happen, will happen,&rdquo; Becky tells her, &ldquo;And he also said that go with your gut,&rdquo; she gives Holly a huge grin before disappearing.<br /><br />Holly takes a deep breath, before placing a call, &ldquo;Hi Honey,&rdquo; she greets her husband, &ldquo;Yes she&rsquo;s when we got here they were all asleep,&rdquo; she answers, &ldquo;but we still don&rsquo;t know anything about the girl,&rdquo; she trails off, knowing her husband would automatically pick up on it, &ldquo; yes that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m calling, aside from giving you an update about your other daughter,&rdquo; she smiles when she hears him sigh, pick up what sounded like his desk phone and start conversing with someone, she could barely make out what they were saying, but it wasn&rsquo;t long before he was back on the line with her everything she needed and wanted to hear, &ldquo;Thank you Seth, you really are perfect,&rdquo; she hears him tell her that he was perfect for her, and she smiles thinking he was absolutely right, he was perfectly made for her.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Judy and Holly were quietly talking in the couch at the corner of the room, the Berrys and Alexis were currently out looking for dinner, and Brittany was sleeping curled beside Quinn, when a knock on the door makes them stop, a man with a shield clipped to his belt comes in and introduces herself as the Detective Cabot, the lead for the case.<br /><br />&ldquo;We went to the cabin where Quinn said she came from, but we didn&rsquo;t find any clues that could lead us to finding him,&rdquo; she tells them gently, &ldquo;Would there be any place you can think of that he might go to? Anyone he could try and get in touch with?&rdquo; she asks Judy.<br /><br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any place or person really, when we divorced his parents stopped talking to me and the girls,&rdquo; she answers, &ldquo;The friends I thought I had before the trial stayed away after from us after he &lsquo;got convicted, and I doubt they&rsquo;d do something as scandalous as help a fugitive,&rdquo; she continuous starting to get worried.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find him, we&rsquo;ll do everything we can and we&rsquo;ll find him,&rdquo; the detective says with conviction, now about the girl, we&rsquo;ve searched any matches in Missing Persons, as well as Child Services, and we didn&rsquo;t find any record of her, we are also unable to question her at this time,&rdquo; she adds, only to be cut-off by a worried voice from the bed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Is Belle ok? Is she awake? She&rsquo;s ok right?&rdquo; Quinn asks rapidly while trying to get out of bed and Brittany&rsquo;s arms.<br /><br />All three adults turn to look at Quinn who seemed to falter on her feet prompting Judy to jump on hers, &ldquo;Baby, not so fast, let&rsquo;s go sit down beside Holly and let Brittany sleep some more,&rdquo; Judy coos leading her daughter to the couch.<br /><br />&ldquo;Did she say her name was Belle?&rdquo; asks Detective thinking this would be something that can help them find the identity of the young brunette<br /><br />And Quinn readily shakes her head &ldquo;I had to stay awake so I kept talking to her, and I felt bad that I didn&rsquo;t know her name so I gave her one,&rdquo; she answers sheepishly, blushing knowing her mother and Holly was smiling at her rambling and telling answer, before remembering that the detective did not in fact answer her questions, &ldquo;Is she ok? Can I see her? Is she awake?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I can tell you that she&rsquo;s ok, and that she&rsquo;s currently sleeping,&rdquo; she tells Quinn, before looking at Judy, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still trying to find out who she is, but given the circumstances, the department thinks that for the time being the girl, who we will refer to as &rsquo;Belle&rsquo; needs an advocate or social worker that can work this case, even without her statement, she is in fact a victim of violence,&rdquo; she then catches Holly&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;Seth called the station, somehow convinced the cap that we could have you take care of it instead.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;And I assume you have the paper work with you?&rdquo; Holly asks, when she gets her answer, she looks over at Judy and then Quinn before she starts speaking again, &ldquo;Can we speak outside Detective?&rdquo; she stands up and tells the Fabray women she&rsquo;ll be right back.<br /><br />Quinn watches them go before telling her mother, &ldquo;I really want to see how she is mom.&rdquo;<br /><br />Judy could only hold her daughter closer whispering, &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Santana opens her eyes, and looks from side to side. Realizing she was alone, she slowly sits up, and smiles as she doesn't feel any pain. She rolls both her shoulders then stretches her arms above her head. Swinging her legs to the side of the bed, she lowers both feet on the ground then wriggles her toes. She rolls her head, smiling as she hears her bones crack and pop.<br /><br />She gets on her feet, and falters as a wave of emotions hit her full force.<br /><br />It was Rachel.<br /><br />She knew what she was about to do was risky and flawed at best. What Rachel did had repercussions and she could only guess what happened to her dear friend after the fact. And as the small brunette was moments from a full breakdown she knew she didn't have much time. So on shaky feet, she gathers her bearings. Yet a nagging thought made her falter, but instead she lets it go fully intending to be there for her dear friend, like she promised.<br /><br />&quot;Besides,&quot; she tells herself, &quot;Coach will understand.&quot;<br /><br />And then she was gone.<br /><br />She appears in a hospital room just as a doctor and nurse was walking out. She pays them no mind and instead keeps her eyes focused on the bed, where whimpers could be heard, coupled with minuscule movement. And she knew, just like she's always known.<br /><br />Something was wrong.<br /><br />She slowly walks toward the bed that seemed too large, it felt wrong, this was never something she thought Rachel would be in. She pauses when the whimpers turned into a sob that was quickly muffled by a hand.<br /><br />Rachel was beyond scared, she was terrified.<br /><br />&quot;Hey,&quot; Santana says in greeting, and takes a step back when Rachel looks towards her. Her friend, her Thumbelina looked at her with terror in her eyes. She could only watch as her friend tried to subtly move away from her.<br /><br />'She's terrified of me,' Santana thinks to herself in horror.<br /><br />&quot;It' ok,&quot; she whispers, &quot;Don't be afraid, just breath, ok, just breathe,&quot; she gently smiles as the smaller girl does as she was told. &quot;Good, just like that,&quot; she coos.<br /><br />Rachel wipes her face with the sleeves of her hospital gown as quick as she could, before looking back at the stranger in her room. She felt familiar, but she was confused and alone. And the girl's sudden appearance and the recognition on her face initially scared her but said stranger's presence gradually made her feel safe, and for the first time since she woke up she didn't feel so alone. And as the stranger beams at her once she had calmed down, she finds herself smiling back just a little.<br /><br />&quot;There you go,&quot; Santana murmurs, &quot;I bet you feel so much better don't you?&quot;<br /><br />Rachel bites her lip before giving Santana the barest of nods, making the standing girl grin and move closer.<br /><br />&quot;So,&quot; she starts drawing out the word, &quot;Wanna tell me what the doc said, that started the waterworks?&quot; Santana immediately senses she said the wrong thing, as the smaller girl burst into tears once again. &quot;Oh no, please don't cry, don't cry,&quot; was all Santana could say, as she tries to console a distraught Rachel, &quot;I'm sorry, please don't cry, I don't like it when you cry, and I know you know that I don't,&quot; Rachel starts crying harder, Santana not knowing what else to do, clears her mind and breathes deep, keeping her eyes on Rachel. Her forehead crinkles in confusion as another barrage of emotions assault her mind only this time so much stronger, something she's never been accustomed to.<br /><em><strong><br />who?<br />scared<br />alone<br />can't<br />no words<br />hurt<br />can't<br />remember<br />who am I?</strong><br /></em><br />&quot;You,&quot; whispers Santana, as something inside of her breaks, her eyes lock with familiar brown eyes and she grabs a trembling hand and she feels her insides clench when Rachel tightens her grip, &quot;I know you're scared,&quot; she says softly, &quot;but somewhere inside of you, you know I could never hurt you,&quot; she adds.<br /><br />Rachel tries to keep her eyes on this stranger standing before her who made her feel safer than the smiling nurse, and gentle doctor who kept asking her questions she couldn't answer, who touched her hand making her cringe. But this beautiful stranger, looked at her with caring eyes, and it looked like this girl felt what she felt, knew what she was thinking.<br /><br />&quot;I'm going to ask you a few questions ok?&quot; she says and smiles as she feels her hand being squeezed &quot;can you speak?&quot; she asks softly.<br /><br />Rachel shakes her head, and more tears flow done her face, and all Santana could do was wipe them away.<br /><br />&quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; Santana asks, somehow knowing the answer. And Rachel shakes her head, eyes filled with anguish. She could only try and smile, trying to show Rachel that it was ok, that it was going to be ok.<br /><br />&quot;You might not remember me here,&quot; Santana starts before lifting her free hand to gently touch Rachel's forehead. She keeps her eyes locked with Rachel's then asks, &quot;But how about here?&quot; she points to Rachel's heart. All she could do was watch as Rachel closes her eyes as if to concentrate.<br /><br />Rachel closes her eyes and just feels, the hand in hers did not stifle her, instead it made her feel safe. Those eyes when looking at her did not feel invasive or pitying, she could instead feel the concern and care. She opens her eyes abruptly when something finally clicked, this girl was no stranger. <br /><br />She was familiar.<br /><br />Santana stifles a sob when Rachel finally nods at her. And all she wanted to do was take her friend in her arms, and take her away from here. But the two voices coming closer stops her from doing so. She turns her head towards the door, and knew she didn't have much time. She looks back at Rachel and tries to smile, she had to leave and this time it was harder than ever, she had to go but she didn't want to leave Rachel defenseless.<br /><br />&quot;I have to go now,&quot; she whispers, Rachel's eyes widen and squeezes her hand tight, &quot;I don't want to, but I really have to. But I'll be back for you, I promise I'll come back,&quot; she says her voice breaking, &quot;They'll take care of you while I can't, but I will come back.&quot;<br /><br />Rachel seems to search her eyes before nodding her head dejectedly, then let&rsquo;s go of her hand. <br /><br />&quot;Close your eyes,&quot; she says softly, Rachel takes one last look at her, lifting up a hand to wipe away a tear that was falling down the Latina's face, she gives her one last smile and then closes her eyes. Santana hears footsteps and she takes a quick look at the door before looking back at Rachel, &quot;sleep,&quot; she utters before disappearing, leaving a sleeping Rachel alone.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Quinn! We shouldn't be here!&quot; exclaims Brittany in a whispered manner, as the other blonde drags her in front of a door, cautiously looking from side to side, &quot;Let's just go back to your room,&quot; she adds all the while pulling the determined girl towards the direction they came from.<br /><br />But Quinn stood her ground, and pulls Brittany back, &quot;I can't wait anymore B! And if I stay in that room any longer, I might just go insane,&quot; she says as she once again checks their surroundings, &quot;besides the doctor already said she could receive visitors, and I just wanted to be first, I need to see that she really is ok,&quot; she adds the last part sheepishly as she blushed faintly.<br /><br />Brittany takes in her friend's overall appearance and demeanor, and could only lift an eyebrow before breaking out in a grin. <br /><br />&quot;What's that smile for?&quot; Quinn asks with her own eyebrow raised, and was just answered with a snort and a head shake, &quot;Fine! Don't tell me, just will you stand guard while I check on Belle?&quot; she asks exasperated, Brittany seemingly was being a tad difficult for some reason. Instead of getting mad, she pouts at her friend, while whispering please over and over again. It seemed like hours until Brittany finally gives her a nod, and she almost jumps for joy, but hugs her friend instead, &quot;Thanks B! You're the best,&quot; she says squeezing her friend tighter before letting go, &quot;I won't take too long, I just want to see her ok?&quot;<br /><br />Brittany nods her head, and giggles as Quinn wasn't quite paying attention to her, the hazel eyed girl had all her focus trained on the door instead, she was looking at the door handle like it would disappear, and Brittany couldn't help herself and said, &quot;Q, it doesn't work that way.&quot;<br /><br />Quinn whips her head around and looks back at her friend, &quot;What?&quot; she asks.<br /><br />&quot;The door,&quot; Brittany quips, &ldquo;You don't stare at it, you turn it silly duck,&quot; she adds with an even bigger grin.<br /><br />&quot;I knew that,&quot; Quinn says before looking back at her friend with a scowl.<br /><br />&quot;Uhuh,&quot; drawls Brittany, amused at her friend, &quot;So why haven't you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Haven't what?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Turned the handle so you can open the door and see your Belle?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;My Belle?&quot; Quinn whispers to herself, her heart stopping, '<em>I'm having a heart attack!'</em> she thinks, only to jerk out of her stupor when she feels a nudge from behind.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn, I really love you and all but you need to get a move on, I don't want our moms to get mad, and they will if we get caught!&quot; says the taller blonde while pushing her friend forward, a few steps closer to the door.<br /><br />&quot;I'm going, I'm going,&quot; Quinn says not moving.<br /><br />&quot;Do you want me to open the big bad door for you Quinny?&quot; teases Brittany.<br /><br />&quot;No!&quot; huffs Quinn, moving even closer, she takes a deep breath before grabbing the handle, and slowly opening the door.<br /><br />&quot;Be brave Quinn, you can do this, nothing to be afraid of,&quot; she tells herself as she takes a step inside the room, closing the door behind her.<br /><br />&quot;She saved your life and like B said, she's your Belle.&quot;<br /><br />Hazel eyes find the pristine bed, and the slumbering form of the small brunette. And like a moth to the flame, Quinn moves forward, getting closer one step at a time. Until she was right beside the girl.<br /><br />She watches the girl sleep, just taking it all in, knowing that they both made it. They were safe.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Tink doing good?&quot; Sue asks appearing beside Santana who just appeared inside the same room she had vacated.<br /><br />&quot;She's awake,&quot; was Santana's clipped answer, eyes downcast, not knowing why she was feeling the way she did.<br /><br />Sue eyes the Latina, surprised at the connection the two friends shared, &quot;And is she well?&quot; <br /><br />Santana's eyes close as she whispers, &quot;She doesn't remember me, and she can't speak.&quot;<br /><br />They stay silent, somehow both needing a few minutes for the situation to sink in before Santana breaks the silence.<br /><br />&quot;She needs me more than ever,&quot; she says, &quot;You need to send me back.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will soon.&quot;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn brushes back some hair, tucking it behind the sleeping girl's ear, she whips her head round when she hears voices outside the door. She turns around and was surprised to find brown eyes looking at her.<br /><br />&quot;Hi,&quot; she whispers smiling.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />She felt fingers on her hair, and heard faint noises from afar. Her eyes open, and sees a girl standing beside her bed making her heart beat so hard, she thought it would burst out of her chest. When their eyes finally meet, everything stops.<br /><br /><em><strong>I know you.</strong><br /></em><br />Then the girl said hi and smiled.<br /><br /><em><strong>I know that voice</strong></em><br /><br />And she smiles back.<br /><br /><strong><em>You're the only thing I remember.</em></strong><br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br /><br /></lj-cut><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

She desperately tries to catch Sue&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Tell me she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was Sue&rsquo;s whispered command, knowing full well what it would mean otherwise.<br /><br />She tries to remain stoic, but her voice tremble as she answers, &ldquo;I tried to stop her coach, I really did. But she&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t listen, she wanted me to make it back here.&rdquo;<br /><br />Carl kneels beside them, grabbing Santana&rsquo;s hand making her focus on him in return, &ldquo;Was it everything?&rdquo; he asks his demeanor changing with every word.<br /><br />And Santana&rsquo;s answer changes everything, &ldquo;If it was, I wouldn&rsquo;t be connected to her would I?&rdquo;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn keeps staring at her wrist, tracing a pattern only she sees. She could vaguely hear someone call her name, she lifts her head up and sees the same police officer from the cruiser.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ms Fabray,&rdquo; he says softly, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we get you checked out,&rdquo; he adds extending out his hand for her to take.<br /><br />She looks at his face and his gentle smile, &ldquo;Can I call my mom first? I need her to know I found help and my phone died awhile back,&rdquo; she tells him as she clasps his offered limb in her smaller one. And he helps her up and immediately let&rsquo;s go of her hand once she was on her feet.<br /><br />&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a phone you can use somewhere,&rdquo; was his reply as he leads her towards the nurse&rsquo;s station, &ldquo;Hi, can we use your phone?&rdquo; he asks one of the nurses. With a nod she hands over the phone and Quinn proceeds to dial a familiar number.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ringing,&rdquo; she tells him before biting her lip in anticipation, &ldquo;Hi Mom, Lexi. I made it I&rsquo;m at Mercy Hospital in Westerville, and right now I&rsquo;m about to get checked out. I don&rsquo;t know how she is they whisked her away as soon as we got here, I&rsquo;ll see you guys here. I love you.&rdquo; She ends the call and places the phone back in its cradle, before looking at the police officer, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably on their way like they said they would be,&rdquo; she tells him.<br /><br />He nods his head once, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get your exam out of the way, and when your mom gets here I can get your statement,&rdquo; he tells her as he leads her to an exam room.<br /><br />&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Quinn whispers right after she had launched herself at the unsuspecting police officer, &ldquo;Thank you so much sir,&rdquo; she says again as she pulled away before turning around to smile at nurse in the room. She wonders why in this room full of strangers, she felt more at ease than in a room with her father. She thinks about &lsquo;Belle&rsquo; praying that she was being taken care of, that she was going to be ok.<br /><br />The nurse directs her to sit on the bed, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started ok Hon?&rdquo; she hears her say. She gives the older lady with a smile, and tries hard to pay attention to what&rsquo;s happening during her exam, and she answers all the questions the best way she could.<br /><br />At one point during her exam, a doctor came in and started asking her questions. Quinn was pretty sure she was able to answer them as best she could, but her mind kept straying to that small girl who had saved her life. She wondered if she would even be told of her condition. If someone was out there worried about her, if there was someone looking for her.<br /><br />Quinn had no idea how long she&rsquo;d been sitting there, she doesn&rsquo;t even remember how many out dated magazines she&rsquo;d leafed through. All she knew was that no one had approached since she sat back down on the surprisingly comfortable seats.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s been trying to read the article on the page she had stopped on, she&rsquo;d gotten as far as the first sentence, when she vaguely hears her name being called. She lifts her head before taking off running.<br /><br />&ldquo;Mommy,&rdquo; she cries clinging to her mother, &ldquo;Mommy you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she whimpers both hands clutching her unto her mother&rsquo;s shirt. She could hear her mother whispering words of comfort, but it all went over her head, she could pay attention to them later, she just wanted to melt in her mother&rsquo;s safe embrace. She keeps her arms wrapped around her, taking in the feel of her, inhaling the scent of her, it was that last reminder that she needed. She was safe, she was with her mother, she was home.<br /><br />She feels a hand on her head, gentle fingers running through her hair, forcing her to lift her head from the her mother&rsquo;s neck, her eyes find familiar hazel ones. Eyes brimming with tears, relief, worry and joy evident in them, &ldquo;Lexi,&rdquo; she croaks, before heaving sobs wrack her body, her mother lets her go long enough for her sister to take her place, pregnant belly cradled in between them.<br /><br />She knew words were being said, her name and prayers of thanks falling from their lips. Their hands never idle, always touching, her arms, her hands, and her head or wiping away her tears, tucking her hair behind her ear. If they weren&rsquo;t speaking she&rsquo;d feel their lips on her forehead, on her cheek, on the back of her head. <br /><br />At one point, she knew her mother directed them to the couch, she knew she had soaked her sister&rsquo;s shirt with her tears and she knew that she was clutching their hands as tight as she could, the same way they clutched hers. And she knew, she finally knew that she was safe. She really made it out. She found her way home.<br /><br />Everyone else in the room could only watch the joyous reunion unfold as the three women clung to each other. Everyone knew that what they saw was either a miracle, or close to one as they could get.<br /><br />Everyone there could only wish that this was the last time this family had to go through anything like this again.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Holly sat in her home office, staring off into space. She kept thinking of what&rsquo;s been happening all around her, kept thinking of what her role really was in all of it.  her ringing phone startles her, and she quickly picks it up, hoping for good news, somehow knowing what she was about to hear just that, &ldquo;Hello, Oh Judy you are? That&rsquo;s good to hear. Yes, I&rsquo;ll let them know right away, I&rsquo;ll go grab it right now, yes we&rsquo;ll see you all soon, take care,&rdquo; ending the call she runs her hand through her hair, &ldquo;Why does it feel like something big is about to happen?&rdquo; she asks out loud. <br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Judy sat back down beside Quinn, putting one arm around her baby, &ldquo;I just called Holly, I&rsquo;m pretty sure we can expect everyone in a few hours,&rdquo; She softly tells her girls as a content smile blossoms on her face as Quinn cuddles closer to her, she gives her forehead a kiss and catches her Alexis&rsquo; eyes who was gently smiling at the scene.<br /><br />A nurse walks towards them, and Quinn sits up straight before trailing the nurse&rsquo;s movement before visibly deflating as said nurse just passes them by, she snuggles back into her mother&rsquo;s side, moving ever so often until finding the perfect position. She sighs happily before tensing up.<br /><br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong Baby?&rdquo; Judy asks, Quinn instead of answering burrows further into Judy&rsquo;s arms, &ldquo;Quinny,&rdquo; prompts Judy.<br /><br />Quinn untangles herself from her mother&rsquo;s arms, biting her lip, &ldquo;Do you think&hellip;&rdquo;, she starts glancing at the double doors where the girl was rushed through, &ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;ll be ok? That she is ok?&rdquo; She asks, &ldquo;Will they tell us how she is, do you think she has a mom and sister worried about her too?&rdquo; Quinn continues forehead scrunched, emotions running wild inside of her, the thought of Belle being alone worrying her, &ldquo;Can we help her get home? Can we stay here until she&rsquo;s ok?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay squirt,&rdquo; Says Alexis, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay as long as you want.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; says Quinn as her eyes grow heavy, she tries to snuggle back into her mother but instead almost falls face first if not for Judy&rsquo;s arms wrapping around her middle. She knows she was asked a question, she tells her mother what she feels instead, &ldquo;Mommy, mm tired,&rdquo; she mumbles before everything goes black.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&ldquo;Hi, we&rsquo;re here to see Quinn Fabray,&rdquo; Holly tells the nurse in front of her, who takes one look at her and her &lsquo;entourage&rsquo; : The Berrys and her darling daughter, worrying her lip while clutching Mr. Lambchop to her body tightly.<br /><br />&ldquo;They&rsquo;re over here,&rdquo; the nurse tells them leading them over a hallway, before stopping at one door, &ldquo;The poor thing was so exhausted she just conked out, we&rsquo;ve been trying to tell her to rest up, but stubbornly refused to leave the waiting area until she knew how the girl she came in with was,&rdquo;  she says adds nodding her head towards one door where an officer stood guarding it, &ldquo;You can go and visit but I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;re all asleep in there,&rdquo; she continues, before moving back towards her station.<br /><br />&ldquo;What of the other girl, the one Quinn came with?&rdquo; asks Hiram.<br /><br />The nurse looks from side to side, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir, I can only release her status to family members or if applicable legal guardians,&rdquo; she gives them a sad smile before leaving.<br /><br />Brittany doesn&rsquo;t waste any time and opens the door and quickly makes her way inside, &ldquo;Q?&rdquo; she whispers, when she finds everyone in the room asleep, she quietly walks over Quinn&rsquo;s bedside, before putting Mr. Lambchop in her best friend&rsquo;s arms, &ldquo;We were worried about you Q,&rdquo; she murmurs, smiling as Quinn grabs on to Mr. Lambchop tighter, she leans forward and kisses Quinn&rsquo;s forehead before turning around to sit beside her mother, who sat with a now awake Judy, she gives her a tight hug before she watches the berry men, fidget beside Quinn&rsquo;s sleeping form.<br /><br />&ldquo;Has anyone said anything about the other girl?&rdquo; Holly asks Judy, who just shakes her head, &ldquo;Not even the detectives or attending?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;The young  man outside, told me that the lead detective will be by in an hour or so, they&rsquo;re at the cabin checking it out, and as for the other girl, she appears to be a minor, and that he can&rsquo;t say anything else,&rdquo; was Judy&rsquo;s answer, before standing to accept the hugs that the Berrys wanted to give.<br /><br />Holly catches her daughter&rsquo;s eyes before giving a barely noticeable nod, she&rsquo;d take care of it. She stands up, letting them know she had to make a call, she had a feeling her hunch was correct, but she just had to make sure.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Holly walks up to the hospital roof and just stood for awhile, and wasn&rsquo;t surprised to hear the voice coming from behind her.<br /><br />&ldquo;The Big Boss wanted you to know, all that should happen, will happen,&rdquo; Becky tells her, &ldquo;And he also said that go with your gut,&rdquo; she gives Holly a huge grin before disappearing.<br /><br />Holly takes a deep breath, before placing a call, &ldquo;Hi Honey,&rdquo; she greets her husband, &ldquo;Yes she&rsquo;s when we got here they were all asleep,&rdquo; she answers, &ldquo;but we still don&rsquo;t know anything about the girl,&rdquo; she trails off, knowing her husband would automatically pick up on it, &ldquo; yes that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m calling, aside from giving you an update about your other daughter,&rdquo; she smiles when she hears him sigh, pick up what sounded like his desk phone and start conversing with someone, she could barely make out what they were saying, but it wasn&rsquo;t long before he was back on the line with her everything she needed and wanted to hear, &ldquo;Thank you Seth, you really are perfect,&rdquo; she hears him tell her that he was perfect for her, and she smiles thinking he was absolutely right, he was perfectly made for her.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Judy and Holly were quietly talking in the couch at the corner of the room, the Berrys and Alexis were currently out looking for dinner, and Brittany was sleeping curled beside Quinn, when a knock on the door makes them stop, a man with a shield clipped to his belt comes in and introduces herself as the Detective Cabot, the lead for the case.<br /><br />&ldquo;We went to the cabin where Quinn said she came from, but we didn&rsquo;t find any clues that could lead us to finding him,&rdquo; she tells them gently, &ldquo;Would there be any place you can think of that he might go to? Anyone he could try and get in touch with?&rdquo; she asks Judy.<br /><br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any place or person really, when we divorced his parents stopped talking to me and the girls,&rdquo; she answers, &ldquo;The friends I thought I had before the trial stayed away after from us after he &lsquo;got convicted, and I doubt they&rsquo;d do something as scandalous as help a fugitive,&rdquo; she continuous starting to get worried.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find him, we&rsquo;ll do everything we can and we&rsquo;ll find him,&rdquo; the detective says with conviction, now about the girl, we&rsquo;ve searched any matches in Missing Persons, as well as Child Services, and we didn&rsquo;t find any record of her, we are also unable to question her at this time,&rdquo; she adds, only to be cut-off by a worried voice from the bed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Is Belle ok? Is she awake? She&rsquo;s ok right?&rdquo; Quinn asks rapidly while trying to get out of bed and Brittany&rsquo;s arms.<br /><br />All three adults turn to look at Quinn who seemed to falter on her feet prompting Judy to jump on hers, &ldquo;Baby, not so fast, let&rsquo;s go sit down beside Holly and let Brittany sleep some more,&rdquo; Judy coos leading her daughter to the couch.<br /><br />&ldquo;Did she say her name was Belle?&rdquo; asks Detective thinking this would be something that can help them find the identity of the young brunette<br /><br />And Quinn readily shakes her head &ldquo;I had to stay awake so I kept talking to her, and I felt bad that I didn&rsquo;t know her name so I gave her one,&rdquo; she answers sheepishly, blushing knowing her mother and Holly was smiling at her rambling and telling answer, before remembering that the detective did not in fact answer her questions, &ldquo;Is she ok? Can I see her? Is she awake?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I can tell you that she&rsquo;s ok, and that she&rsquo;s currently sleeping,&rdquo; she tells Quinn, before looking at Judy, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still trying to find out who she is, but given the circumstances, the department thinks that for the time being the girl, who we will refer to as &rsquo;Belle&rsquo; needs an advocate or social worker that can work this case, even without her statement, she is in fact a victim of violence,&rdquo; she then catches Holly&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;Seth called the station, somehow convinced the cap that we could have you take care of it instead.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;And I assume you have the paper work with you?&rdquo; Holly asks, when she gets her answer, she looks over at Judy and then Quinn before she starts speaking again, &ldquo;Can we speak outside Detective?&rdquo; she stands up and tells the Fabray women she&rsquo;ll be right back.<br /><br />Quinn watches them go before telling her mother, &ldquo;I really want to see how she is mom.&rdquo;<br /><br />Judy could only hold her daughter closer whispering, &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Santana opens her eyes, and looks from side to side. Realizing she was alone, she slowly sits up, and smiles as she doesn't feel any pain. She rolls both her shoulders then stretches her arms above her head. Swinging her legs to the side of the bed, she lowers both feet on the ground then wriggles her toes. She rolls her head, smiling as she hears her bones crack and pop.<br /><br />She gets on her feet, and falters as a wave of emotions hit her full force.<br /><br />It was Rachel.<br /><br />She knew what she was about to do was risky and flawed at best. What Rachel did had repercussions and she could only guess what happened to her dear friend after the fact. And as the small brunette was moments from a full breakdown she knew she didn't have much time. So on shaky feet, she gathers her bearings. Yet a nagging thought made her falter, but instead she lets it go fully intending to be there for her dear friend, like she promised.<br /><br />&quot;Besides,&quot; she tells herself, &quot;Coach will understand.&quot;<br /><br />And then she was gone.<br /><br />She appears in a hospital room just as a doctor and nurse was walking out. She pays them no mind and instead keeps her eyes focused on the bed, where whimpers could be heard, coupled with minuscule movement. And she knew, just like she's always known.<br /><br />Something was wrong.<br /><br />She slowly walks toward the bed that seemed too large, it felt wrong, this was never something she thought Rachel would be in. She pauses when the whimpers turned into a sob that was quickly muffled by a hand.<br /><br />Rachel was beyond scared, she was terrified.<br /><br />&quot;Hey,&quot; Santana says in greeting, and takes a step back when Rachel looks towards her. Her friend, her Thumbelina looked at her with terror in her eyes. She could only watch as her friend tried to subtly move away from her.<br /><br />'She's terrified of me,' Santana thinks to herself in horror.<br /><br />&quot;It' ok,&quot; she whispers, &quot;Don't be afraid, just breath, ok, just breathe,&quot; she gently smiles as the smaller girl does as she was told. &quot;Good, just like that,&quot; she coos.<br /><br />Rachel wipes her face with the sleeves of her hospital gown as quick as she could, before looking back at the stranger in her room. She felt familiar, but she was confused and alone. And the girl's sudden appearance and the recognition on her face initially scared her but said stranger's presence gradually made her feel safe, and for the first time since she woke up she didn't feel so alone. And as the stranger beams at her once she had calmed down, she finds herself smiling back just a little.<br /><br />&quot;There you go,&quot; Santana murmurs, &quot;I bet you feel so much better don't you?&quot;<br /><br />Rachel bites her lip before giving Santana the barest of nods, making the standing girl grin and move closer.<br /><br />&quot;So,&quot; she starts drawing out the word, &quot;Wanna tell me what the doc said, that started the waterworks?&quot; Santana immediately senses she said the wrong thing, as the smaller girl burst into tears once again. &quot;Oh no, please don't cry, don't cry,&quot; was all Santana could say, as she tries to console a distraught Rachel, &quot;I'm sorry, please don't cry, I don't like it when you cry, and I know you know that I don't,&quot; Rachel starts crying harder, Santana not knowing what else to do, clears her mind and breathes deep, keeping her eyes on Rachel. Her forehead crinkles in confusion as another barrage of emotions assault her mind only this time so much stronger, something she's never been accustomed to.<br /><em><strong><br />who?<br />scared<br />alone<br />can't<br />no words<br />hurt<br />can't<br />remember<br />who am I?</strong><br /></em><br />&quot;You,&quot; whispers Santana, as something inside of her breaks, her eyes lock with familiar brown eyes and she grabs a trembling hand and she feels her insides clench when Rachel tightens her grip, &quot;I know you're scared,&quot; she says softly, &quot;but somewhere inside of you, you know I could never hurt you,&quot; she adds.<br /><br />Rachel tries to keep her eyes on this stranger standing before her who made her feel safer than the smiling nurse, and gentle doctor who kept asking her questions she couldn't answer, who touched her hand making her cringe. But this beautiful stranger, looked at her with caring eyes, and it looked like this girl felt what she felt, knew what she was thinking.<br /><br />&quot;I'm going to ask you a few questions ok?&quot; she says and smiles as she feels her hand being squeezed &quot;can you speak?&quot; she asks softly.<br /><br />Rachel shakes her head, and more tears flow done her face, and all Santana could do was wipe them away.<br /><br />&quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; Santana asks, somehow knowing the answer. And Rachel shakes her head, eyes filled with anguish. She could only try and smile, trying to show Rachel that it was ok, that it was going to be ok.<br /><br />&quot;You might not remember me here,&quot; Santana starts before lifting her free hand to gently touch Rachel's forehead. She keeps her eyes locked with Rachel's then asks, &quot;But how about here?&quot; she points to Rachel's heart. All she could do was watch as Rachel closes her eyes as if to concentrate.<br /><br />Rachel closes her eyes and just feels, the hand in hers did not stifle her, instead it made her feel safe. Those eyes when looking at her did not feel invasive or pitying, she could instead feel the concern and care. She opens her eyes abruptly when something finally clicked, this girl was no stranger. <br /><br />She was familiar.<br /><br />Santana stifles a sob when Rachel finally nods at her. And all she wanted to do was take her friend in her arms, and take her away from here. But the two voices coming closer stops her from doing so. She turns her head towards the door, and knew she didn't have much time. She looks back at Rachel and tries to smile, she had to leave and this time it was harder than ever, she had to go but she didn't want to leave Rachel defenseless.<br /><br />&quot;I have to go now,&quot; she whispers, Rachel's eyes widen and squeezes her hand tight, &quot;I don't want to, but I really have to. But I'll be back for you, I promise I'll come back,&quot; she says her voice breaking, &quot;They'll take care of you while I can't, but I will come back.&quot;<br /><br />Rachel seems to search her eyes before nodding her head dejectedly, then let&rsquo;s go of her hand. <br /><br />&quot;Close your eyes,&quot; she says softly, Rachel takes one last look at her, lifting up a hand to wipe away a tear that was falling down the Latina's face, she gives her one last smile and then closes her eyes. Santana hears footsteps and she takes a quick look at the door before looking back at Rachel, &quot;sleep,&quot; she utters before disappearing, leaving a sleeping Rachel alone.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Quinn! We shouldn't be here!&quot; exclaims Brittany in a whispered manner, as the other blonde drags her in front of a door, cautiously looking from side to side, &quot;Let's just go back to your room,&quot; she adds all the while pulling the determined girl towards the direction they came from.<br /><br />But Quinn stood her ground, and pulls Brittany back, &quot;I can't wait anymore B! And if I stay in that room any longer, I might just go insane,&quot; she says as she once again checks their surroundings, &quot;besides the doctor already said she could receive visitors, and I just wanted to be first, I need to see that she really is ok,&quot; she adds the last part sheepishly as she blushed faintly.<br /><br />Brittany takes in her friend's overall appearance and demeanor, and could only lift an eyebrow before breaking out in a grin. <br /><br />&quot;What's that smile for?&quot; Quinn asks with her own eyebrow raised, and was just answered with a snort and a head shake, &quot;Fine! Don't tell me, just will you stand guard while I check on Belle?&quot; she asks exasperated, Brittany seemingly was being a tad difficult for some reason. Instead of getting mad, she pouts at her friend, while whispering please over and over again. It seemed like hours until Brittany finally gives her a nod, and she almost jumps for joy, but hugs her friend instead, &quot;Thanks B! You're the best,&quot; she says squeezing her friend tighter before letting go, &quot;I won't take too long, I just want to see her ok?&quot;<br /><br />Brittany nods her head, and giggles as Quinn wasn't quite paying attention to her, the hazel eyed girl had all her focus trained on the door instead, she was looking at the door handle like it would disappear, and Brittany couldn't help herself and said, &quot;Q, it doesn't work that way.&quot;<br /><br />Quinn whips her head around and looks back at her friend, &quot;What?&quot; she asks.<br /><br />&quot;The door,&quot; Brittany quips, &ldquo;You don't stare at it, you turn it silly duck,&quot; she adds with an even bigger grin.<br /><br />&quot;I knew that,&quot; Quinn says before looking back at her friend with a scowl.<br /><br />&quot;Uhuh,&quot; drawls Brittany, amused at her friend, &quot;So why haven't you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Haven't what?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Turned the handle so you can open the door and see your Belle?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;My Belle?&quot; Quinn whispers to herself, her heart stopping, '<em>I'm having a heart attack!'</em> she thinks, only to jerk out of her stupor when she feels a nudge from behind.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn, I really love you and all but you need to get a move on, I don't want our moms to get mad, and they will if we get caught!&quot; says the taller blonde while pushing her friend forward, a few steps closer to the door.<br /><br />&quot;I'm going, I'm going,&quot; Quinn says not moving.<br /><br />&quot;Do you want me to open the big bad door for you Quinny?&quot; teases Brittany.<br /><br />&quot;No!&quot; huffs Quinn, moving even closer, she takes a deep breath before grabbing the handle, and slowly opening the door.<br /><br />&quot;Be brave Quinn, you can do this, nothing to be afraid of,&quot; she tells herself as she takes a step inside the room, closing the door behind her.<br /><br />&quot;She saved your life and like B said, she's your Belle.&quot;<br /><br />Hazel eyes find the pristine bed, and the slumbering form of the small brunette. And like a moth to the flame, Quinn moves forward, getting closer one step at a time. Until she was right beside the girl.<br /><br />She watches the girl sleep, just taking it all in, knowing that they both made it. They were safe.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Tink doing good?&quot; Sue asks appearing beside Santana who just appeared inside the same room she had vacated.<br /><br />&quot;She's awake,&quot; was Santana's clipped answer, eyes downcast, not knowing why she was feeling the way she did.<br /><br />Sue eyes the Latina, surprised at the connection the two friends shared, &quot;And is she well?&quot; <br /><br />Santana's eyes close as she whispers, &quot;She doesn't remember me, and she can't speak.&quot;<br /><br />They stay silent, somehow both needing a few minutes for the situation to sink in before Santana breaks the silence.<br /><br />&quot;She needs me more than ever,&quot; she says, &quot;You need to send me back.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will soon.&quot;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn brushes back some hair, tucking it behind the sleeping girl's ear, she whips her head round when she hears voices outside the door. She turns around and was surprised to find brown eyes looking at her.<br /><br />&quot;Hi,&quot; she whispers smiling.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />She felt fingers on her hair, and heard faint noises from afar. Her eyes open, and sees a girl standing beside her bed making her heart beat so hard, she thought it would burst out of her chest. When their eyes finally meet, everything stops.<br /><br /><em><strong>I know you.</strong><br /></em><br />Then the girl said hi and smiled.<br /><br /><em><strong>I know that voice</strong></em><br /><br />And she smiles back.<br /><br /><strong><em>You're the only thing I remember.</em></strong><br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br /><br /></lj-cut><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

She <br />remembers making smores with her mom, and star gazing until she fell asleep in her arms.<br /><br />She remembers all the good times they had, and the not so good times when her father would get drunk, nights and sometimes mornings when he&rsquo;d be so different from her daddy, nights when she&rsquo;d fall asleep clinging to Alexis and Mr. Lambchop afraid of all the noises coming from outside their room.<br /><br />Quinn shakes her head, and pushes the gas pedal harder. It was not the time to reminisce. She had to get out of there. She needed to get out of the woods, needed get away from the cabin. She needed to find help, for her.<br /><br />She takes a left and sighs in relief when she sees what seemed to be a bigger road. Finally feeling that they are as far away from the cabin as possible, she grabs her phone and dials a familiar number.&nbsp; She knows that once she hears their voices, she&rsquo;ll breakdown. She also knows that she needs to hear their voice, she needs their words of comfort, and she needs to let them know she was safe.<br /><br />&ldquo;You can do this Quinn, be brave, be strong,&rdquo; she tells herself before finally pressing call, and setting it to speaker phone. It barely even rings before she hears a panicked voice frantically speaking.<br /><br />&ldquo;Quinny! Quinny, are you ok? Alexis its Quinn! Baby, please say something.&rdquo;<br /><br />Her mother&rsquo;s voice brings tears to her eyes, &ldquo;Mommy,&rdquo; she croaks out.<br /><br />She heard her mother let out a sob, &ldquo;Oh baby, where are you? What happened?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Daddy got me Mommy, and he took me to the cabin, but I escaped and then someone saved me,&rdquo; she cries, wishing nothing more than to feel her mother&rsquo;s arms around her. She hears another voice that makes her cry some more, prompting her to make a complete stop.<br /><br />&ldquo;Kiddo, I&rsquo;m so glad to hear your voice,&rdquo; murmurs Alexis.<br /><br />Quinn sniffles, and tries hard not to cry, &ldquo;Lexi, I was so scared,&rdquo; she whimpers, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to do and I&rsquo;m not sure what happened, but when I found a way to escape I did, but he pointed a gun at me Lexi, Daddy shot at me and missed, he was going to kill me. I knew he would, I could hear it in his voice, just like when he broke my arm, I knew,&rdquo; she swallows hard, wanting to just get it all out there, &ldquo;I could see it In his eyes, I knew what he wanted to do, even before I was able to escape and I couldn&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t let him to do that,&rdquo; she continues only to have her mother cut her rambling.<br /><br />&ldquo;Baby, did he,&rdquo; she starts to ask, and Quinn could hear Alexis whimpers filter through the phone, making her feel so much worse.<br /><br />&ldquo;NO! No mommy, I escaped, and I ran as fast and as far as I could, but I feel into the river, and the water was so strong and I was just so tired, but she saved me Mommy, she did,&rdquo; she says glancing to her right where the unconscious girl sat unmoving, &ldquo;The next thing I know, I was waking up, and I was beside a fire in front of the cabin and I saw her and she was bleeding, and I didn&rsquo;t see him anywhere so I just grabbed her, hotwired the van and drove away, I called B then I called you,&rdquo; she says finally stopping to breathe.<br /><br />&ldquo;Kiddo,&rdquo; Alexis says, voice breaking, &ldquo;Quinn, where are you? Is she still with you? Are you safe?&rdquo; she asks.<br /><br />Quinn breaks down some more she could hear how scared her sister was. And she felt so guilty, for once again causing their family so much <br />anxiety and grief. And before she even knew it rage filled her whole body. She wanted to hurt her father, for coming back, for doing this to them once again. She hated how much power he seemed to still have over them. She hated how powerless she felt, just like when she was younger. <br /><br />Her fists clench and all she could think of was hurting him back. So lost in her thoughts she never heard her sister and mother calling her name, worriedly asking if she was still on the line. When she hears her sister scream her name she snaps out of her thoughts and finally acknowledges them.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she whispers. Sorry for everything, for not being careful. For being scared, for once again putting her family through another harrowing ordeal, for being weak, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Quinn Fabray!&rdquo; her mother says loudly, &ldquo;You have nothing to be sorry for! You listen, and you listen good young lady, you have nothing to be sorry for, absolutely nothing, you didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong and none of this is your fault. Your father is a very sick man; you didn&rsquo;t make him this way. He just is. Everything that has happened has been in no way shape or form you fault.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;But I should have been more careful, after he called the shop, after we knew he was out, I should have been more careful,&rdquo; she reasons, she knew without a doubt that if she just had been more careful, more mindful they wouldn&rsquo;t be in this state.<br /><br />&ldquo;Quinn, we all know that if he really wanted something, absolutely wanted something, he would stop at nothing to get it. Do you understand? None of this is your fault,&rdquo; Alexis tells her.<br /><br />&ldquo;But, I &ndash;&ldquo; she tries again.<br /><br />&ldquo;No. You&rsquo;re safe and that&rsquo;s all that matters,&rdquo; Her mother tells her with an air of finality, &ldquo;The girl who saved you, is she with you?&rdquo; her mother asks, successfully distracting her from her guilt.<br /><br />&ldquo;She&rsquo;s here, I think there&rsquo;s something wrong, she hasn&rsquo;t woken up,&rdquo; she tells them suddenly afraid, what if she doesn&rsquo;t wake, her heart squeezed painfully at the thought of it, &ldquo;Mom, what if she doesn&rsquo;t wake up?!&rdquo; she asks frantically, moving so she could check on the girl. Once again she berates herself for forgetting about her savior, her own angel. She checks for a pulse, &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; she mumbles out loud as she feels a faint but steady one, she could see the girls chest rise and fall, and her eyes stay glued to it and she looks away in shame when she hears her mother calling her name, Good job Quinn, the girl is probably concussed and God knows what else and you accidentally perv on her. Amazing!<br /><br />&ldquo;She&rsquo;s still breathing mom, and her pulse is there but it&rsquo;s slow and faint,&rdquo; she says answering her mother&rsquo;s questions.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; her mother says and she sighs in relief, only for it to be short lived, &ldquo;But you need to get her to a hospital as soon as possible, you said she was bleeding, is she still?&rdquo;<br /><br />Quinn gently lifts the girl and sees her injured back, &ldquo;Yes, but I think it&rsquo;s slowed down,&rdquo; she answers worriedly biting her lip, all she could think of was that she messed up once again, this beautiful stranger saves her life and what does she do, she&rsquo;s on the side of the road crying to mommy.<br /><br />&ldquo;Quinn focus, stop blaming yourself,&rdquo; Alexis says authoritatively. &ldquo;Just go find help ok? Do you know where you are?&rdquo; she asks.<br /><br />Quinn frowns wondering how her sister seemed to know what she was thinking, &ldquo;I think I see a highway from here, but I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; she shimmying back to the driver&rsquo;s seat.<br /><br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good try and look for anything that can tell you where you are ok, and we&rsquo;ll stay on the line until you&rsquo;re safe or your phone dies, whichever comes first.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Ok Lexi,&rdquo; she whispers closing her eyes to say a silent prayer before starting the car once again. She takes one long look at her savior before continuing on to find safety, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go ok Lexi?&rdquo; she asks in a small voice.<br /><br />&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll stay on the line I promise,&rdquo; her sister answers.<br /><br />&ldquo;Just keep talking ok, please,&rdquo; Quinn add, &ldquo;I just need to hear you guys so I know that it&rsquo;s real.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s real baby?&rdquo; her mother asks.<br /><br />Quinn takes a deep breath and bites her lip as it trembles, &ldquo;That I got away,&rdquo; she says wiping away her tears, desperately willing herself not to cry. <br /><br />&ldquo;You did baby, you got away and you&rsquo;re far away from your father and you&rsquo;ll find help soon enough, just focus on that ok?&rdquo; her mother tells her soothingly, &ldquo;Just focus on coming back to us,&rdquo; she adds.<br /><br />Taking one last look at her unlikely hero, she takes a deep breath and drives on, &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she tells her mother, focusing on finding her way back home.<br /><br />Quinn drives on, and listens to her mother and sister chatter on about the pregnancy, she would interject randomly usually when asked a question. She&rsquo;d look to her right looking for a random sign or landmark she could relay to her mother, and slip a glance or two at the unconscious girl. She knew enough to know that she had to get the girl to a hospital as soon as she could, she&rsquo;s actually contemplated calling 911 but was quite unsure how she would explain where they were. But something catches her eye and she pushes on the gas pedal a little harder. Intent on getting as close to it as possible.<br /><br />&ldquo;Mom! I think I see a sign about a highway,&rdquo; she exclaims excitedly, &ldquo;I think it says Highway 71,&rdquo; she squints her eyes trying to read the sign still a bit further away than she wanted, &ldquo;Yeah I really think it says 71,&rdquo; she confirms driving a little bit faster.<br /><br />&ldquo;71, the first town you&rsquo;ll come across would Westerville I believe, it might lead you to Columbus, you&rsquo;ll probably come across a state trooper or a sheriff baby, that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; was her mother&rsquo;s reply.<br /><br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to get home,&rdquo; she mumbles under her breath, &ldquo;will you guys be there?&rdquo; she asks softly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Of course kiddo, the minute we put the phone down we&rsquo;re getting the quickest flight home,&rdquo; Alexis says with conviction, &ldquo;Nothing will keep me away ok?&rdquo; she adds.<br /><br />Quinn sniffles at this before softly saying, &ldquo;Thank you Lexi.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my baby sister Quinn, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be anywhere else.. So you find yourself some help and be ready cause once I see you I won&rsquo;t be letting go ok?&rdquo; she heard her sister&rsquo;s voice break, followed by sniffling and then choked sobs.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry Lexi,&rdquo; she says wiping her tears away as well, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re ok,&rdquo; Lexi whispers. Quinn wanted nothing more than to be in the same room as her family, to make all of it real. That she did escape and that she was indeed ok, that she was safe was far away from Russell Fabray. She vaguely hears her mother tell Alexis that she was going to get her some water, all she could focus on was the sound of her sister sniffling, she&rsquo;s never heard her sister sound like this, and she was she never wanted to hear it ever again.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok Lexi, and we&rsquo;ll be together soon,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;And when you&rsquo;re done smothering me, you can smother this girl that saved me, and then when everything settles down, I&rsquo;ll be at your beck and call,&rdquo; she says trying to make light of the situation they found themselves in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll even rub your foot for you, even if they are yucky.&rdquo;<br /><br />Alexis laughs at this before saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll regret saying that Quinn!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Which part?&rdquo; she asks loving how her sister&rsquo;s laughter makes her feel so much better.<br /><br />&ldquo;All of it,&rdquo; was Alexis&rsquo; answer, &ldquo;So how is she?&rdquo; she asks.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: small;""><br />Quinn spies a glance at her unconscious companion, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s still knocked out cold, I really hope nothing&rsquo;s seriously wrong,&rdquo; she says wondering why her fingers seemed itching to touch her, why even if they were relative strangers, she felt so at ease with her presence even if she was basically passed out the whole time. She couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that she knew this girl.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that way, just focus on finding help,&rdquo; was her sister&rsquo;s gentle reminder. Quinn drives on glancing to her right from time to time, the sun was rising and as it rose, light touched the brunette just right, she looked magnificent, she looked peaceful, she looked beautiful she looked like an angel.<br /><br />&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Alexis asks her breaking her train of thought.<br /><br />Perplexed Quinn furrows her brows before asking, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You said something, what was it?&rdquo;<br /><br />Quinn&rsquo;s eyes widen and her cheeks turn red, &ldquo;nothing,&rdquo; she mumbles realizing the train of thought she had before Alexis asked her a question. She blushes further when she hears her sister laughing. Just as she was about to say something more, they hear a beep, a tell tale sign that her <br />phone was dying.<br /><br />&ldquo;Is that,&rdquo; Alexis starts only to have Quinn cut her question short.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;How long until,&rdquo; she lets her question trail off.<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Lexi,&rdquo; She answers, before asking a question herself, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s mom?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Right here honey, are you almost at the highway?&rdquo; Her mom asks.<br /><br />&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The minute you see someone that can help, you stop ok? You tell them what happened and you have them take care of that girl.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes mom.&rdquo;<br /><br />Another beep could be heard.<br /><br />&ldquo;And you call as soon as you can, we&rsquo;ll be there soon ok Quinn?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;OK.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;And we love you kiddo&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I love you guys too.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Just stay calm ok? You got away and that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo;<br /><br />And another.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes mom.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I love you Quinn, we&rsquo;ll be here soon ok?&rdquo;<br /><br />Just as Quinn was about to answer silence envelopes the whole vehicle, her phone had finally died, she&nbsp; picks up her phone,&nbsp; and stares at it before placing it back on the dashboard. She heaves a heavy sigh and keeps her eyes trained on the road ahead. Looking for road markers, or directions, a whimpering sound breaks her concentration; she turns to look at her passenger.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she says softly not wanting to frighten the girl, &ldquo;are you awake?&rdquo;<br /><br />She holds her breath waiting for the other girl to say something, anything. She keeps glancing towards the girl, but nothing came. &ldquo;I was kinda hoping you would wake up,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;It would actually make me feel so much better if you did,&rdquo; she adds trying hard to keep her eyes on the road, &ldquo;And I totally feel weird talking to you since you&rsquo;re unconscious and everything, but I just really need to get this out. Thank you, you didn&rsquo;t need to save me, but you did and you saved my life,&rdquo; her eyes get blurry, and she softly shakes her head to stop her tears, &ldquo;you saved my life and I&rsquo;ll save yours, &ldquo; she reaches across the seat to grab the other girl&rsquo;s hand, she gives it a squeeze before whispering, &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Please coach, you have to send me back, you have to send me back,&quot; Santana begs, sluggishly trying to get out of Sue's arms. She groans in pain when her movements stretches her back and affects her wound. She was tired, but Rachel needed her, she couldn't just abandon her friend, not after everything they've been through.<br /><br />&quot;Santana how were you injured?&quot; Sue asks as she keeps her hold on her subordinate, Becky had stormed in the council stating that Santana was wounded and was on her way back, she spies Carl move beside her presumably to check the damage, &quot;You need to tell us how so we'll know how to heal you,&quot; she says her voice rising as they arrive at head quarters.<br /><br />Santana knew coach was talking to her, but all she wanted was to go back, &quot;Please send me back,&quot; she whimpers tiredly, &quot;I need-- Rae--&quot; she tries to say only interrupted as she started coughing.<br /><br />&quot;I'll send you back, I promise I will,&quot; Sue tells her,&quot;but you need to tell me how? Do you understand, you won't be much help to anyone if we don't heal you in time,&quot; she adds gravely.<br /><br />&quot;My knife, Dave,&quot; Santana says softly that only Sue heard her, she was tired and her eyes were growing heavy, coach promised she'd be sent back. She'll find her friend and do anything, absolutely anything to keep her safe, anything to keep them both safe. <br /><br />Sue could only watch as Santana's eyes close, healers had rushed forward as soon as Santana informed them of how she was injured, they took the newly appointed defender as Sue was left kneeling there. She could only hope that Rachel was faring better than Santana, especially now that she was all alone. She feels as if she had failed, she had failed Rachel and Quinn, failed Santana, when it was the last thing she ever wanted to do. the last thing she could afford to do. She looks at her hands, stained with Santana's blood and she had never felt so pathetic in her entire existence, they were byproducts of choices, of decisions made by one being, someone who now seemed bigger than any of them had anticipated.<br /><br />&quot;Coach,&quot; she hears snapping her out of her musings, &quot;We need to figure out what to do,&quot; he adds.<br /><br />Sue takes one look at where Santana was whisked away before nodding her head. This was the only thing she could do, it was the thing she had to do.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&ldquo;Sure is empty for a highway,&rdquo; Quinn grumbles under her breath, she chances a quick glance to her passenger and bites her lip, &ldquo;I really wish you would wake up soon, but you have no idea how relieved I am that you&rsquo;re still breathing, like I am sooo glad you still are,&rdquo; her eyes widen and she all but dives towards the passenger seat placing a hand just beneath the girl&rsquo;s prominent nose, &ldquo;Thank God! For a moment there, I thought you had stopped breathing.&rdquo;<br /><br />She takes a few deep breaths and suddenly pulls back her hand upon noticing that her hand had strayed lower, face red she starts spouting apologies, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, I wasn&rsquo;t trying to cop a feel, and I&rsquo;m not saying that because you don&rsquo;t have umm breasts, coz you do. And it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;ve stared at it, I have eyes, and I did feel them when I carried you in the van, and I&rsquo;m not a perv feeling you up or anything like that but it was the only way I could carry you in,&rdquo; Quinn finally stops to take in a deep breath, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m rambling like this. Um please excuse me,&rdquo; she tells the unconscious girl, before putting one hand on her mouth trying to muffle her scream of frustration.<br /><br />&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try that again shall we?&rdquo; she asks knowing she wouldn&rsquo;t get an answer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I wasn&rsquo;t trying to feel you up, I was just preoccupied in making sure you were in fact still breathing, And I wasn&rsquo;t trying to cop a feel when I carried you into the van either,&rdquo; she says quickly before taking a deep breath, &ldquo;You should get used to this, I can sometimes go off tangent and not that I&rsquo;m a big talker, I usually am once I get real close to someone,&rdquo; she says with a grin, &ldquo;and for some unknown reason, for the life of my I can&rsquo;t stop talking to you, I just&nbsp; keep talking and talking,&rdquo; she continues before she runs out of breath and has to stop.<br /><br />She steals another glance at her companion before hitting herself on the forehead, wincing right after she did, &ldquo;I am such a dummy, my mom would totally tell not like the fact I forgot my manners, My name&rsquo;s Quinn, Quinn Fabray,&rdquo; she says with a small smile, &ldquo;And I realize that I do look crazy, since I&rsquo;m introducing myself to an unconscious girl, but it feels weirder that after everything we&rsquo;ve been through so far, I don&rsquo;t even know your name,&rdquo; she takes another look before keeping her eyes trained on the road.<br /><br />After a few minutes of silence Quinn starts talking again, &ldquo;So we&rsquo;ve established that my name is Quinn Fabray, rambler extraordinaire, and since I can&rsquo;t ask for your name at the moment, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to give you one,&rdquo; she exclaims with a grin and nod of her head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll call you Belle, coz you kinda remind me of her, the Disney Princess I mean, she was a brunette, which you are,&rdquo; she says glancing at the thick brown hair adorning the girl&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;She was brave, just like you coz if you weren&rsquo;t I doubt you&rsquo;d have been able to save me,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;And she was beautiful which is exactly what her name means,&rdquo; she says before whispering, &ldquo;and you are, beautiful that is,&rdquo; her cheeks once again turn red and she clears her throat trying to get rid of the lump that had suddenly formed there.<br /><br />&ldquo;So yeah, Belle it suits you,&rdquo; she squeaks out prompting her to clear her throat once again, &ldquo;And once we find help and you&rsquo;re actually conscious, I&rsquo;ll introduce myself all over again,&nbsp; I promise, oh and another thing you should know and will probably find out pretty soon is that everyone important to me,&rdquo; she says with a small smile, &ldquo;Will hug you a lot, like a real lot,&rdquo; shrugging her shoulders she keeps on, &ldquo;when they&rsquo;re done smothering me with bear hugs and kissed and once the doctor gives them the OK, they&rsquo;ll be on you just like Winnie the Pooh is with honey.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;But I call dibs,&rdquo; Quinn whispers to herself.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;This is a disaster Doc, an absolute disaster,&quot; says Sue as she paces the floor, occasionally stopping as Emma was moving from one point to another, sweeping the already pristine floor.<br /><br />&quot;I understand that you have some doubts about our current action plan,&quot; Carl says from his seat, &quot;But we knew the possible consequences,&quot; he adds.<br /><br />Sue abruptly stops and turns to advance at the seated man, narrowly missing Emma, she points her finger at Carl, &quot;Santana almost perished, and we don't know where Rachel is, let alone how she is, she's not even in the feed Carl!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You need to calm down Coach, You won't do them any good if you're mad,&quot; Carl tells her.<br /><br />&quot;Don't patronize me, this could have all been prevented,&quot; Sue continues undettered, &quot;You know, you've known all this time and I believed you when you said we could handle it, that they could handle it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Are you doubting their abilities?&quot; Carl asks finally standing up.<br /><br />Sue glares at him, and leans down aggravated, &quot;Are you mocking his capabilities?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Stop it!&quot; Emma screams forcing the two to break apart, &quot;This is not the time to argue, we need to fix it, we need to fix this now!&quot;<br /><br />Carl plops down his seat and looks sheepsihly at Emma, whil Sue visibly deflates and takes the seat across from him, &quot;Now we know what we are up against, What we should work on is what we can do to save Rachel, and her ward,&quot; says Emma as she too sits down.<br /><br />&quot;Her chosen,&quot; mutters Carl and Sue.<br /><br />Emma's eyes widen at the new information, &quot;Ohh,&quot; she says, &quot;Well that makes things a bit more complicated then.&quot;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&ldquo;So I told you about my mom, Lexi and the most important man in my life, Mr. Lambchop,&rdquo; she says with a small giggle, &ldquo;I told you about the Mr. Berrys Hiram and Leroy, so we move on to my best friend, Brittany!&rdquo; she says with a bit of flair in her tone, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the best dancer I know, and she&rsquo;s also the best hugger ever,&rdquo; she continues as if talking about a well kept secret, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s obsessed with ducks and cats, actually she loves animals a lot, and has a heart of gold,&nbsp; she and her family are one of the reasons I am who I am today, and she&rsquo;ll totally love hugging you,&rdquo; her grin grows bigger, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d tell you that you&rsquo;re perfectly fun size, and would probably stay glued to you until someone pries her away.&rdquo; <br /><br />She sighs talking about her family was making her feel better, she had initially thought she wouldn&rsquo;t see them ever again, and this girl, her savior, her hero, no her angel came swooping in to save her from the nightmare that was her father, and the circumstance she found herself in while with him. She takes a long look at her companion and sees her breathing grow shorter, shallower even and a whimper breaks the monotonous sound of the engine that had accompanied the silence when Quinn stopped talking and it prompts her to step harder on the pedal.<br /><br />&ldquo;Just hang on for me ok Belle, you can&rsquo;t give up now,&rdquo; Quinn says loudly, a light skinned hand shooting out to grasp a tanned one, the cold Quinn feels makes her press on faster, &ldquo;Stay with me, please angel stay with me,&rdquo; she begs before letting go of the clammy hand and focusing on the road ahead, wishing, praying for anything that can help them, help her.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />She was alone but she could hear her<br /><br />She could hear her beautiful voice<br /><br />Calling out to her<br /><br />Calling out for her<br /><br />&lsquo;please angel, stay with me&rsquo;<br /><br />But something was pulling her away.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Santana's eyes open wide, and she lifts her head trying to figure out where Rachel was only to realize her friend's sacrifice. She tries to get up, but was stopped by a firm but gentle hand on her shoulder.<br /><br />&quot;Please lie still, we're still not done healing you,&quot; the voice tells her.<br /><br />She doesn't listen, and instead rolls her shoulders and stretches her back. She could barely feel the pain, but she knew that she still wasn't a hundred percent,&nbsp; She gets off the bed and almost falters in her steps, &quot;I have to go,&quot; she says.<br /><br />A hand grabs her arm, &quot;You can't leave, you shouldn't,&quot; the healer insists.<br /><br />Santana turns her head and looks at her eyes hard, and with a determined voice and stance says, &quot;Make me.&quot;<br /><br />They look at each other for what seemed like hours, before the hand on Santana's arm lets go. Santana disappears not long after.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />They had just passed the Welcome Sign, and Quinn barely pays attention to how fast she was going, all she did care about was finding help and finding it fast.<br /><br />&ldquo;Stay with me ok, just stay with me,&rdquo; she says over and over again.<br /><br />Spying a hospital sign she pushes on the gas pedal harder, the engine roars and she moves forward, onwards. She was close, they were close.<br />Then she hears it first, the sound of sirens, she looks at the rear view mirror and sees the flashing red and blue, she knows they were getting closer, and somehow she&rsquo;s not quite sure how, but she stops and soon after the squad car is parking in front of her, she looks to her right, and finds the small brunette shivering, she places a hand on her forehead and gasps at how cold she was.<br /><br />&ldquo;Stay with me please, Belle, stay with me,&rdquo; she begs.<br /><br />A sharp knock startles her prompting her to turn around, the officer takes one look at her before grabbing his radio saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Quinn Fabray, she&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;<br /><br />The cop slowly opens her door, instead of getting out, Quinn turns around moving closer to the unconscious girl, grabbing her face, &ldquo;Stay with me, ok? Don&rsquo;t go ok?&rdquo; she tells the girl before turning back towards the cop, &ldquo;You have to help her please, she&rsquo;s been unconscious for so long, and she&rsquo;s lost some blood,&rdquo; she tells him brokenly, tears falling down her face.<br /><br />&ldquo;Call a bus!&rdquo; the cop tells his partner who was still by the squad car, as he walks round the van towards the passenger side, &ldquo;Quinn, it&rsquo;s ok, Help is on the way alright,&rdquo; he tells her soothingly, gently checking the other girl&rsquo;s vitals, &ldquo;I need you to get out of the van, and stay with my partner over there ok?&rdquo; he tells her.<br /><br />&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t leave her, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Quinn says through her tears, shaking her head. &ldquo;You need to stay with me Belle, I still need you to wake up so I can properly introduce myself, like I promised.&rdquo;<br /><br />Another set of sirens reach Quinn&rsquo;s ears, and they were getting closer.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hear that, help&rsquo;s on the way Belle, so just hang on, ok? Just hang on for me.&rdquo; Quinn mumbles, wiping away her tears with one hand, and squeezing a clammy hand in the other.<br /><br />A pair of hands fall on her shoulders, a soft voice tells her that she needs to let go so that they could help her friend, she feels herself being slowly led out of the van but she keeps her eyes trained on the brunette, she watches as they slowly carry her out of the van, and places her on the stretcher. She shrugs off the hands on her shoulder and instead rushes towards the still unconscious girl that was going paler by the minute.<br /><br />&ldquo;Stay with me ok? Just stay with me.&rdquo; She says again, her hand holding unto a smaller one squeezing it once, twice.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;How long?&quot; Emma asks Carl, &quot;How long have you known?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A while now, I kept stumbling into anomaly after anomaly,&quot; he answers.<br /><br />Emma then turns to Sue, &quot;Where do you come in?&quot; she asks.<br /><br />&quot;Doc and I talked about a few things we've seen, at first we thought it was system glitches, until Rachel it made sense then. Rachel was his biggest mistake, and he'll do anything to cover it up,&quot; she answers.<br /><br />&quot;Surely the boss knows about this,&quot; exclaims Emma, &quot;This is his 3rd in command we're talking about,&quot; she implores.<br /><br />Just as Sue was about to say something, Santana appears falling to her knees in front of Sue, &ldquo;Send me back,&rdquo; she grunts, painfully trying to stand up.<br />&ldquo;You can barely stand, what makes you think I&rsquo;ll send you back in this state?&rdquo; Sue asks incredulously.<br /><br />Santana stands straight before speaking voice clear and strong, &ldquo;Because you and I both know, I&rsquo;d still go with or without your permission,&rdquo; their eyes locked together, never wavering, a silent conversation take place, only to be broken as Santana starts coughing, before falling down on her hands and knees screaming in pain.<br /><br />&ldquo;When you are healed, I will send you back,&rdquo; Sue tells her as she crouches down beside Santana, &ldquo;But you need to heal, you are no good to either of them like this, do you understand?&rdquo; <br /><br />Santana nods her head once before gritting her teeth in pain, suddenly she arches her back and her scream bounce off of the walls.<br /><br />Sue&rsquo;s eyes widen at the display, before whispering &ldquo;Rachel.&rdquo;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />She was afraid, but not for herself. For someone else. <br /><br />He was angry so angry.<br /><br />Gunshots.<br /><br />Screams.<br /><br />Punches.<br /><br />Bones breaking.<br /><br />Pain, so much pain.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn&rsquo;s eyes widen as she could only watch as the brunette suddenly arches her back, before collapsing then whimpering in pain, all around them the paramedics were busy trying to figure out what was wrong, they come to a sudden halt, and the doors are pried open.<br /><br />She follows them jumping out of the ambulance, running right after them as her angel was being wheeled in. She grabs the rail with one hand, she refused to leave her side, not until she absolutely had to.<br /><br />Someone, a nurse was telling her she had to stay in the waiting area, that the police wanted to speak to her, but she barely listened, she kept her eyes on her hero, kept looking at those closed lids, wanting nothing more than to see them open.<br /><br />A hand grabs her wrist, and she instinctively looks down only to gasp when she finds out whose hand it was. She looks back up in time to see the brunette blinking, eyes fluttering trying to adjust to the light, before turning towards her.<br /><br />Their eyes meet, and everything else fade away. <br /><br />Before they come crashing back down as the brunette&rsquo;s eyes close once again, Quinn left in the wings, as a nurse held her back, her savior wheeled away.<br /><br />Quinn touches her wrist, gently tracing where she could still feel the girl&rsquo;s hand on hers. She takes one more look at the door where the other girl disappeared, before wordlessly moving back towards the waiting room where the nurse was leading her to.<br /><br />&ldquo;Her eyes,&rdquo; she whispers.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes dear?&rdquo;&nbsp; the nurse asks her.<br /><br />Quinn just shakes her head, and just shuffles her way to a chair, &ldquo;I remember them.&rdquo;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />TBC<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span></lj-cut>"

I seriously can't feel my legs!""><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">It&rsquo;s been two days since Rachel and Quinn made up, thanks to the most awesome pet tortoise ever! Thank you very much. And it just so happened to be Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</p>  <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">And this morning Quinn crept in Rachel&rsquo;s room to wake her up with snuggles and kisses and hot vegan cocoa too.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t believe in the idea of Valentine&rsquo;s Day but I wanted to make up for the past few days we weren&rsquo;t technically together,&rdquo; Quinn murmurs, as I hear Rachel stretch.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Quinn,&rdquo; Rachel whines, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do any of this,&rdquo; she says.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I know baby, but you deserved to be pampered,&rdquo; Quinn tells her with a kiss, &ldquo;So get a move on and drink your vegan cocoa and when you&rsquo;re ready I&rsquo;ll be downstairs waiting for you with breakfast ready ok?&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">And as Rachel walks over me to get to her bathroom, Quinn swoops me up and brings me downstairs, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry big guy, I have something for you too,&rdquo; she whispers.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">She puts me down beside the feeding tray that she and Rachel made for me, a variety of red colored things were just waiting to be eaten.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Thank you Quinn! </i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I started munching, completely forgetting that I was supposed to be on a diet, it barely registers that Rachel had come down, and I never noticed them leaving for school.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">So I spent the rest of the day lounging and eating, I played a little. Pushing a ball round and round is fun. I ventured outside and basked in the sun only for a little while, and before I knew it Rachel was home, scrambling to get ready. She grabbed me from the floor and ran up the stairs before dropping me on her bed.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Hey! Careful there little lady!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Quinn is picking us up in a few hours, I need you to help me choose what to wear,&rdquo; she says excitedly while going through her closet.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Oh Joy!</i></b>&nbsp;</p>      <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Sarcasm does not look good on you Tello,&rdquo; Rachel says so casually it caught me off guard.</p>  <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Wait, what?</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Oh Tello, your confusion is both endearing and amusing. But now is not the time to dwell on the fact that I can hear you, and I&rsquo;ve been hearing you for awhile,&rdquo; she tells me in such a patronizing way it ruffles my non-existent feathers, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how many times I find myself struggling not burst out in giggles, or just hug you or kiss you,&rdquo; she continues.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">How long?</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Tello! We&rsquo;re wasting time here, Quinn will be back soon and we&rsquo;re not ready yet,&rdquo; she huffs.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Rachel!!!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Ok Fine, I&rsquo;ve been hearing you for awhile now and at first I really did think I was going crazy, but then it all just made sense, I am psychic after all&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">And you&rsquo;re not freaked out?</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Oh there was, remember that day that I kept looking at you funny? That was when I was trying to figure out if I was crazy, so I decided to spend the night at Quinn&rsquo;s and well I kind of thought back to when she and I first kissed and I figured it out,&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Figured what out?</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;That you had a hand in it and a lot of other things too. So thank you for everything Tello, you really are the best friend I could ever ask,&rdquo; she tells me before giving me a kiss, &ldquo;So now that we have that all ironed out, can you assist me in finding the perfect apparel for tonight&rsquo;s outing?&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Yeah! You should wear one of your skirts, Quinn loves seeing you in a skirt. Or shorts, really, really short shorts; I mean it is warm out.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Gosh Tello, I never knew you were such a perv,&rdquo; she says unamused.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I look at her evenly</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Between me and you, I&rsquo;m pretty sure you are. Come to think of it you and you&rsquo;re girlfriend are.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Tello!&rdquo; she shrieks.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">What it&rsquo;s true, the things you guys do.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Tello!&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Baby, oh Quinn!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Keep it up, and I&rsquo;m letting you sleep in that nice little house daddy made for you, outside!&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">You can&rsquo;t resist my cuteness, actually you&rsquo;re girl has a little soft spot for me. I bet I can get her to make you reconsider.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Just help me find something to wear!&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">I bet you wish you didn&rsquo;t tell me you could hear me now huh.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">&nbsp;</i></b>&ldquo;Tello please, we really need to get ready, if you really want to continue with the teasing and jibes can we do it later, or maybe another day?&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Later sounds good.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Tello, what are you planning? Tello!&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">I like that, you should wear that.</i></b><br /><br />Safe to say it was interesting to have my relationship with Rachel change just because we now communicate. I must admit I kind of like it.</p>        <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">So when Quinn comes to pick us up, and Rachel tells me to behave, I told myself what the hell, might as well do as told. And here we are walking around the neighborhood.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I could hear them chatting behind me, an occasional giggle would spring out followed by the distinct sound of kissing. it was all very sweet and gag worthy. And it&rsquo;s just making me wish I had my own girl.</p>  <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong><i><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">It's been months, when is the honeymoon stage ending?</span></i></strong></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&quot;You're so adorable when you blush,&quot; Quinn says leaning in to kiss Rachel again.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Rachel accepts the kiss before swatting Quinn's shoulder, &quot;Stop making me blush!&quot; she says with a small smile.</p>  <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Quinn just laughs and takes a look at him, and sees that he's made some good distance, she pulls Rachel forward to follow him, &quot;But it's true! I swear, you have the most amazing drool worthy legs,&quot; Quinn tells her, stopping right behind the moving tortoise.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&quot;This conversation would be better continued in the privacy of my home Quinn,&quot; Says Rachel, who bends down just a little intent on grabbing Tello to put him back in the wagon Quinn, was dragging around.</p>  <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><em><b><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">I agree with Rachel! I don't want to walk anymore! Who even thinks of taking a TORTOISE out for a walk? it's absolutely ridiculous.</span></b></em></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&quot;Just one more block please,&quot; Quinn pleads, &quot;I've been planning to do this thing even before we fought--&quot;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><em><b><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">Look Quinn, I know I totally helped you out and all but this is torture! this is animal cruelty! I demand you take us home imm--</span></b></em></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&quot;--and I thought, a picnic at the park, and star gazing would be amazing. There's supposed to be a meteor shower tonight, and I found the most amazing spot!&quot; she says</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong><i><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">Awww man! Quit being so sweet.</span></i></strong></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&quot;Why'd you have to be so perfect? I feel like I don't deserve you sometimes,&quot; whispers Rachel before pulling Quinn down for a kiss.</p>  <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">It was Quinn's turn to blush, &quot;I ask that question all the time, and I just want to make up for everything I've ever done. You deserve every nice thing I do and will do,&quot; she whispers, &quot;You deserve that and more,&quot; she adds eyes locked with her girlfriend.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">They release each other and start walking again.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong><i><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">I can't feel my legs! I seriously can't feel my legs!</span></i></strong></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&quot;Hey where's Tello?&quot; says Rachel.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong><i><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">I think I'm going to faint, why is it suddenly dark? OMG why am I floating? Why do I feel so weightless! where the hell are my legs?!?</span></i></strong></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&quot;Hey Big Guy, why are you hiding, did all the walking tire you out?&quot; Quinn asks me, poking me at what appears to be a protruding foot.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong><i><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">That's my foot! I didn't lose it! I'm ok! I'm alive! I wasn't being abducted by aliens so they can experiment on me and put in some probes or turn me into a ninja turtle! Thank God!</span></i></strong></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I poke my head out and see her looking at me funny, her eyebrow quirks up, &quot;OK, it's either I just heard you Ranting,&quot; she says in a whisper, &quot;or I'm going crazy like Rachel thinking she's kinda psychic.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Quinn Fabray! I heard that!

I hope all of you find these offerings satisfactory.<br />&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Quick call the police! There are bandits about!""><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">It&rsquo;s been more than a week and today was Thursday, and Rachel was at her dance class. Usually around this time Quinn would arrive with a treat or two just for me. I glance over at Rachel&rsquo;s alarm and an overwhelming feeling of sadness flow through me. It was already 4:13PM and she was nowhere in sight. I hate to admit it, but I miss her, I&rsquo;m pretty sure Rachel does too. I heard her crying a few nights ago.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I drag my feet as I make my way to Rachel&rsquo;s door, I know her daddy is downstairs and since my elevator is now fixed, I can probably use my powers of cuteness and have him pay attention to me until Rachel comes home, then we can probably sulk together.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Just as I was just two feet away I hear scratching noises from the window, and I cringe as I hear it being open.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Quick call the police! There are bandits about!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I was pretty sure my mouth hung wide open; I think I was imagining things. I thought for sure I saw familiar hands open the window, and I was quite convinced I saw a blonde head poke through it once it was open. The pair of white sneakers placed just right was familiar to me, but the bag of rose petals did it for me. She was here.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Hey big guy, Miss me?&rdquo; she says with an easy smile.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">If I was close enough I would have kissed her feet, even if she still had socks on. I wanted to run over to her, and hug her, which wasn&rsquo;t entirely possible. You know what I&rsquo;d settle for gently biting a toe. That should work.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">QUINN!!!!!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">She makes her way to me, and lies down on her belly beside me opening her bag of treats, &ldquo;I missed you, both of you,&rdquo; she whispers handing over some rose petals. Instead of eating them right away, I move closer to her and nuzzle my face to hers.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">You guys should make up already.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure things just were taken out of context, I didn&rsquo;t mean to make her feel as if I was accusing her of it, besides it seemed more like Santana&rsquo;s style,&rdquo; she tells me rubbing a finger across my head as I chew on my treats.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">That spitfire!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;B found out that S did after all cause they were dissing B too, and that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s still mad at S. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;ll be ok by tomorrow,&rdquo; she tells me, &ldquo;I wish me and Rach would be ok too,&rdquo; she adds in a whisper.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Footsteps&rsquo; going up the stairs grabs both their attention, &ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Quinn curses and runs to hide in the closet.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Hiding in the closet Quinn?! Really?!?!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Rachel&rsquo;s dad comes in and looks at the open window and the sneakers right beside it, he kneels beside me and pats my shell, &ldquo;What do you have there Tello?&rdquo; he asks.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I feign innocence and just keep munching my treats, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he figured it out anyway.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I keep telling you no treats, or you&rsquo;ll ruin your dinner tsk tsk,&rdquo; he tells me admonishingly before standing up, he closes the window, and just as he was closing the door he says, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to sneak in Quinn, I&rsquo;d let you come in the front door, but you should talk to Rachel soon. This little spat has gone on too long.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Quinn squeaks, she actually squeaks before saying, &ldquo;Ok Leroy,&rdquo; she answers.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Oh and Quinn, the closet really?&rdquo; he jokes laughing his way downstairs.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Quinn finally emerges from the closet, closing it as she does, &ldquo;I really have to go Tello, give Rachel a kiss for me ok?&rdquo; she says sadly as she leaves the room shoes in hand.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I knew then, I had to do something, anything to get them back together, even I was getting depressed.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;-o-o-o-o-</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Since they started dating, Saturdays were alternatively spent between houses. Last week had they been ok, we would have spent the day over at the Fabray&rsquo;s and Judy would have spoiled me rotten, much like her daughter. This week had they not been fighting Quinn would be over, and we&rsquo;d play games until Rachel is done with her weekend vocal conditioning.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">They would then spend the rest of the day doing homework, being lovey-dovey, watching TV, making out and anything else they happen to think of doing. One time they decided making me move from one girl to another was fun, I was powerless to resist strawberries.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">This Saturday, Rachel was up bright and early, I barely heard her insane ramblings about something and something, and before I knew it I was downstairs, and she was gone. I briefly wonder if she had caffeine. I wander towards the front door and bump into it enough times that Hiram opened the door for me. I make my way out and walk across the yard, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wander to far Tello, I don&rsquo;t want a repeat of last year,&rdquo; he tells me as I was close to the sidewalk, I stop and stay still and as soon as he back inside, I start walking again.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I knew exactly what to do to get Quinn and Rachel back together.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">I better get epic brownie points for this Universe. I take treats and other entertaining things as payment. But what I really want is a lady friend. I want to gets my freak on.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I start walking, and walking, and walking.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I&rsquo;m five houses down and just turned right and I wonder if this was a good idea. Quinn lives 4 blocks away, I&rsquo;m never going to get there in time.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">At this rate, Armageddon will start before I get there. And it will be lovingly referred to as Rachel Berry&rsquo;s wrath.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I kinda ran away once, she got mad at me. And it was not pretty. Nope not pretty at all.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I pass another house, and then another and I was getting tired, I haven&rsquo;t had breakfast yet, and I didn&rsquo;t plan this whole thing through, why did I ever believe I was a mutant tortoise that can walk four freaking blocks!</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">What if I get run over by a car, OMG what if I get run over by a car and made into soup? Oh wait that&rsquo;s turtles. Wait what if someone takes me; I&rsquo;ll never see Rachel, her dads and Quinn! I knew I should have let Rachel put a tag. Stupid Tello! Stupid! Stupid!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">A hear the tires squeal and I try and walk faster.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Oh God, oh God someone just saw, they&rsquo;re going to take me! Oh no! Nonononononono!</i></b> <b style=""""><i style="""">Help! Anybody! I don&rsquo;t want to go; I still want to have children! I don&rsquo;t want to die a virgin!</i></b></p>      <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I think I hear someone calling my name, but I pay it no mind. I idly wonder why I am unable to do more than run, whatever happened to my superpowers? Ok I&rsquo;ll focus on that some other time.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">You won&rsquo;t get me. I won&rsquo;t let you!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I hear the person following me scream, &ldquo;Tello! Where the hell are you going?! And Why are you alone, where&rsquo;s Rachel,&rdquo; and I turned as fast as I could, once I saw who it was all I wanted to do was kiss her feet.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">QUINN!!!!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">OK, I think it&rsquo;s time I be honest with myself, I like her, I like how she is with me, I like that the Berry&rsquo;s accept her, and most of all I like that she loves my neurotic, crazy and high maintenance Rachel, even if they get into arguments a lot, she loves Rachel and Rachel loves her. So yes, I approve of Quinn Fabray.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">You&rsquo;re here! I don&rsquo;t have to come find you!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">She lifts me up in her arms, and takes me to her car. She puts me in the passenger seat, and she buckles in and gives my shell a pat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I saw you Tello, wouldn&rsquo;t want you to go on adventure without me and my ba-, and Rachel around,&rdquo; she says as she drives towards the Berry house.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">I was going to your house to have you take me back, eh see how these things turnout. And if I know the Berry&rsquo;s Rachel is probably back home by now, panicking that I can&rsquo;t be found anywhere.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I hope Rachel won&rsquo;t get mad at you for running away like that one time,&rdquo; she teases.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">GOD! It was one time! ONE time!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ve been doing some thinking, I was so miserable this past week,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever want that to happen again, so I well I&rsquo;m going to talk to Rachel and I&rsquo;m going to apologize and we&rsquo;ll discuss all of this things that usually cause us to fight.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Yeah, cause you both clearly have tons of issues to go through.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">She parks her car, and I wait for her to carry me back home, and I was surprised that Rachel wasn&rsquo;t out of the front door the minute Quinn had me in her arms. Hiram lets out a sigh of relief and shouts out that Quinn found me, &ldquo;You are in so much trouble Donatello Berry, so much trouble.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I hang my head in shame, and I barely listen as Hiram starts thanking Quinn and telling her to bring me out back, it only means one thing. I&rsquo;m sleeping outside tonight.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;So where did you find him?&rdquo; Hiram asks.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Quinn puts me down before answering, &ldquo;He had just turned left on Lincoln St.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Lincoln you say, if I didn&rsquo;t know any better I think he was trying to come find you, not that it&rsquo;s possible, I mean I don&rsquo;t think it is,&rdquo; says Hiram.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">I was, I wanted them to talk already and this was the only way I thought of.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I feel Quinn sit beside me, and she starts rubbing my head, &ldquo;Is it ok if I stay for awhile? He looks miserable, and I actually wanted to talk to Rachel too,&rdquo; Quinn tells Hiram.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Alright, and I&rsquo;m glad one of you is taking the initiative, God knows how stubborn both of you can get,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Judy called last night asking if we should take matters in our hands seeing as both of you were miserable, but not doing anything about it,&rdquo; he adds going inside.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;So, you think Rachel will talk to me once she gets home?&rdquo; she asks me, &ldquo;I know things moved a bit fast for us, and we changed, but we still carry some of the crap from before, and well I guess it&rsquo;s seeping into our relationship,&rdquo; she continues.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">You got that right!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I playfully pretend to bite her fingers as she wriggles them at me, I knew she was trying to get her thoughts in order, &ldquo;I love her, I really do. And I know I often get mad at her, that we get into a fight a lot of times, we wouldn&rsquo;t be Quinn and Rachel if we didn&rsquo;t, but I think it&rsquo;s time we took time to really talk about it,&rdquo; she says looking up at the sky, &ldquo;Pretty soon we&rsquo;re heading off for college and I want to still be with her, I want to be with her in New York, cheering her on, supporting her, loving her and I know she&rsquo;ll do the exact same thing for me,&rdquo; at this point she was sniffling a bit. To be honest I would have been to, but I don&rsquo;t have tear ducts as far as I know.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;So she and I need to talk, because I need her to know all of that,&rdquo; she adds in a whisper before she starts chuckling, &ldquo;Oh look at me blubbering like an idiot, I bet you&rsquo;re laughing at me.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">I&rsquo;m totally packing up and moving in with you if Rachel doesn&rsquo;t talk to you once she gets home. And no, I think you&rsquo;re actually kind of sweet. And between you and me she&rsquo;s been thinking of the same thing, even made a pros and cons list. I think she printed out her arguments last night.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s ok,&rdquo; she tells me, &ldquo;I know that Rachel considers you as one of her closest friends and confidante, and I really need you to know that you never have to worry about her, I mean you do, but as long as she&rsquo;ll let me, I&rsquo;ll take care of her, I love her, and someday I plan on telling her that I want to spend the rest of my life with her, and maybe have a baby or two,&rdquo; she says all this in a rush and I barely have enough time to wrap my head around everything when it hits me.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Wait, Babies?</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;And who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll finally get around to giving you your own girl, seeing as you kinda got us together in the first place, being cute and all.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">I support that move wholeheartedly.</i></b></p>      <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;So I really hope Rachel gets home soon, I kinda feel stupid talking to you, cause you never talk back and stuff,&rdquo; she shrugs and continues, &ldquo;I just want to have everything all sorted out so I can tell her that I got my acceptance letter to Columbia this week, and that I&rsquo;ve missed her so much, and that I&rsquo;m sorry and that I never ever want to not talk to her ever again,&rdquo; I guess we were both so into this well semi one sided conversation neither of us noticed Rachel standing by the door, I noticed first of course.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Hey Rachel have I ever told you how lucky both of you are to have found each other.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Rachel steps forward, and the wood creaks beneath her foot, prompting Quinn to turn around, &ldquo;Did you mean it Quinn?&rdquo; she asks.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Which part?&rdquo; Quinn asks standing up.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Rachel moves closer, and they were a few inches apart, &ldquo;New York and college, babies, Columbia and everything in between, did you mean? Do you really want to be with me?&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I watch Quinn swallow the lump in her throat, and I notice Rachel bite her lip in anticipation, I wish I could just roll my eyes at them, sometimes they&rsquo;re just so ugh. So I nudge the closes body to me, and this propels them closer.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Get this show on the road guys! Come on get a move on!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I meant it, I meant everything,&rdquo; Quinn comes closer.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sorry,&rdquo; they say at the same time, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; they say again.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">See much better.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">I turn around just as they were leaning closer, I know what comes next, I hear kissing sounds, and mumbled apologies and promises.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Ok, you can stop now. Guys please; it&rsquo;s really just gag worthy. So stop it. I thought you were going to talk!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I love you Rachel Berry,&rdquo; Quinn whispers between kisses.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I love you, Quinn Fabray,&rdquo; was Rachel&rsquo;s answer.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Please stop! I mean it&rsquo;s adorable and all, but seriously.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;We have a lot to talk about,&rdquo; Rachel says in between kisses.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Yes we do, and we should ummm, oh god baby, we should start now,&rdquo; Quinn says brokenly, and I really don&rsquo;t want to even attempt to think what Rachel was doing right now.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">I can hear you know, just cause I&rsquo;m not looking doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t hear.</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;My Dads told me they were watching a double feature with your mother to give us privacy for this talk,&rdquo; says Rachel</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">Ok young lady, when did your voice turn so sultry? </i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Baby, we should, hmmmm, umm, we should,&rdquo; Quinn tries to say, &ldquo;Ok talk later, yes definitely later.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">OK! I DEMAND YOU LEAVE ME HERE AND TALK IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN BEDROOM!</i></b></p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you so much Rach, I hate it when we fight, and I&rsquo;m sorry it was stupid, so stupid,&rdquo; murmurs Quinn.</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I missed you too much baby, so much. It was stupid, mmmm oh Quinn, I agree it was stupid, and we should talk later, much later.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><b style=""""><i style="""">OH GOD!

Angel, anyone,&rsquo; <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming Quinn, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; she says taking flight once again.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />The van stops and Quinn feels absolute terror when her father gets out of the driver's seat. She tries to move away from the door, wriggling as best she could. She jumps when the door slides open.<br /><br />&quot;Come here Quinn, Daddy won't hurt you if you're good,&quot; he says in a sickeningly sweet voice.<br /><br />It sent chills down Quinn's spine; she tries kicking her feet as her father grabbed them and pull her towards the door.<br /><br />&quot;I don't want to hurt you princess. Don't make me hurt you,&quot; Her father warns her.<br /><br />The way he said it made no room for doubt, he'd do it in a heartbeat. <br /><br />&quot;If you promise that you'll be my good princess, I'll take these off,&quot; he says pointing to the ropes on her hands and the gag on her mouth, &quot;I mean it Quinn, no funny business. Besides if you remember this Cabin, we're far away from anyone that can help you,&quot; he adds as his eyes stay glued on hers.<br /><br />She shudders at how dark his eyes, and slowly nods her head. 'Be brave Quinn, strong like an Amazon.' she tells herself as she feels his calloused hand on her skin, she cringes as he takes time to trace her face, and tuck her hair behind her ear.<br /><br />&quot;You're so beautiful Quinn, you remind me so much of your mother,&quot; he says as he helps her to her feet leading her up the stairs into the cabin.<br /><br />'God please help me,' she prays as he closes the door behind them.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Rachel falls down on her knees, she looks up to the sky and cries in desperation, &quot;I can't find you, I can't...&quot; she says brokenly.<br /><br />She feels a presence moving towards her and she is quickly on her feet, sporting a defensive stance.<br /><br />&quot;Rachel?&quot;, &quot;Santana?&quot; they say at the same time.<br /><br />&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Russell is planning something, and I couldn't do anything, I was stuck and couldn't move.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He took Quinn.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I couldn't even report back to coach.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;She's scared, and so am I.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You won't believe who's egging him on Rach.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;and I can't find her Santana, I'm failing her, at the time she needs me the most,&quot; Rachel screams once again falling down on her knees, &quot;It hurts so much and I can't do the simplest act of finding her, I can't hear her anymore, I'm so sorry Quinn,&quot; she says beating the ground repeatedly.<br /><br />Santana falls beside her, she puts her hands on Rachel's face, &quot;Rachel stop it,&quot; she says wiping away her tears, &quot;Listen to me, ok, listen to me coz we don't have much time,&quot; she says, &quot;Think of Quinn, think of her, of all the times you were with her, all the times you were without her,&quot; she moves to hold Rachel in her arms, &quot;remember the last time you held her in your arms, remember what she said, your hearts were beating at the same time.&quot;<br /><br />Rachel nods her head at this, she remembered everything, &quot;I know you feel it Rachel, and I know you do. You could never forget your Quinn; you could never let her down,&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I feel her Santana, she's so scared, but trying to be brave,&quot; whispers Rachel, eyes screwed shut, fist clenching.<br /><br />Santana then grabs her hands, &quot;What else Rach, what else?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He took her to the woods, a cabin,&quot; she opens her eyes catching Santana's gaze; &quot;I know where she is.&quot;<br /><br />In a blink of an eye they were gone.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Here you go Quinn, I hope you like it, it's my specialty,&quot; says Russell as he places a plate filled with pasta.<br /><br />Quinn clasps her shaking hands tight as he kisses the top of her head, &quot;Thank you Daddy.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Still well mannered I see, I'm glad Judy didn't ruin everything I taught you,&quot; he says as he starts eating.<br /><br />Getting her fork she tries to eat along with him, she had to make him trust her to survive. It was the only thing she could do.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />A ball of light shatters the calm hill, two figures burst through it hitting the ground hard. <br /><br />Santana gets on her knees gasping for air, &quot;Ok, what was that?&quot; she asks Rachel who was struggling to catch her breath.<br /><br />&quot;There's a no fly zone on Lima,&quot; she says brokenly.<br /><br />Brushing off leaves from her arms Santana tries to stand up, &quot;It explains why I couldn't leave or do much, doesn't explain why you could with me hitchhiking.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;She's close Santana, I can feel her,&quot; Rachel says instead, walking away.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Come here Princess tell me everything I missed,&quot; slurs Russell as he pats the space beside him on the couch.<br /><br />Quinn warily looks at him, and the bottle of scotch he held in his hand before sitting down a few inches away from him.<br /><br />&quot;How is Alexis? And you what's keeping you busy? Any boys I should know about?&quot; he asks before taking a long drink from the bottle.<br /><br />Quinn bites her lip, &quot;She's doing well, she married a nice man and they live in Boston,&quot; she answers.<br /><br />&quot;And you, any boys I have to chase away?&quot; he slurs.<br /><br />She wraps her arms around herself before answering, &quot;No daddy, I'd rather focus on school, cheerios and glee.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Are you cold?&quot; he asks noticing Quinn shiver, &quot;Why don't you come closer Princess,&quot; he adds with a smirk.<br /><br />Quinn's blood run cold, 'Help, please,' she prays.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;We need to move faster,&quot; says Rachel, grabbing Santana's arm.<br /><br />A twig snapping make them turn around, &quot;Well, well, well look what we have here,&quot; says one voice.<br /><br />&quot;Oooh it's the teacher's pets,&quot; taunts another.<br /><br />&quot;You...this is your doing isn't it?&quot; Rachel accuses pointing at the smaller one.<br /><br />He grins walking slowly towards her, &quot;Well not all me my lovely nightingale, I had a little help,&quot; he says.<br /><br />&quot;I didn't think it was possible for both of you to stoop so low, actually I'm not as surprised about you,&quot; Santana says pointing to the larger one, who moves to tackle the Latina. Stopping short when he feels a hand on his chest.<br /><br />&quot;So this is what happened to you? You chose this path?&quot; says Rachel, &quot;And you dare use the moniker I bestowed upon you in your quest to spread evil?&quot;<br /><br />He appears behind Rachel and whispers in his ear, &quot;I did quite enjoy being your Lark Rachel but this was all your doing,&quot;<br /><br />Rachel spins glaring at him, &quot;My decision to become mortal had nothing to do with you Jesse!&quot; she screams<br /><br />&quot;It had everything to do with me; I wanted to be with you for eternity,&quot; he answers back angrily, &quot;You chose to leave me behind to be with weak pathetic human beings.&quot;<br /><br />All four of them feel a change in the atmosphere. Jesse starts laughing, &quot;I just love how unhinged Russell Fabray is when drunk, Poor Quinny, do you think you can save her this time?&quot;<br /><br />Rachel grits her teeth; her shoulders tighten and was ready to pounce.<br /><br />&quot;Some guardian you are, letting Daddy hurt poor little Quinny,&quot; taunts the other a few feet away.<br /><br />A blur pushes him against a tree, Santana's arm pressing down his neck, &quot;You know nothing, you don't get to dis Rachel or what we do,&quot;<br /><br />He pushes back sending her flying across the clearing, &quot;I can do whatever I want to do bitch,&quot; he says laughing.<br /><br />&quot;Now Dave, remember they're our friends,&quot; Jesse tells him as they stood side by side, &quot;I think it's time we show them a good time Bull,&quot; he adds rolling his neck, Dave manically smirks and cracks his knuckles.<br /><br />Rachel readies herself, &quot;We don't have to do this,&quot; she says only to be knocked back. She lifts a hand to soothe her aching jaw, only to find the corner of her lip bleeding.<br /><br />&quot;That's it!&quot; Santana says before charging at Dave, &quot;Come on bull, show me what you got,&quot; she taunts as she appears behind him, delivering a karate chop to the side of his neck causing him to stumble. Santana smiles in triumph for a second, she find herself face down on the ground, a knee placed in the middle of her back.<br /><br />&quot;I don't think you're ready for me lil reaper,&quot; he taunts putting more pressure on her back causing her to growl, He laughs at this but is thrown aside.<br /><br />Santana jumps to her feet in an instant, &quot;You were saying big guy?&quot; she says jumping from one foot to another.<br /><br />Jesse and Rachel circle each other, &quot;Jesse, we don't have to do this,&quot; she says arms up palms facing forward; a kick is delivered to her stomach. She stumbles and whips her head around looking for him.<br /><br />&quot;Au Contraire my Nightingale we do, I've been waiting a long time for this,&quot; he says side sweeping her then appearing a few feet away.<br /><br />Rachel gets up from the ground, looks at him just as she disappears; Jesse follows right behind her, grabbing her foot. They tumble to the ground. Jesse straddles Rachel and proceeds to punch her face, &quot;Do you really think I'll let it go that easily,&quot; he screams at her, &quot;I despise what you've become, loving that filthy mortal,&quot; he adds spitting at her face before delivering another blow.<br /><br />--<br /><br />&quot;Pfft, you fight like a girl,&quot; Dave says with an evil smile, &quot;You think you can take me tiny?&quot;<br /><br />Santana sneers before letting her wings unfurl, majestic white wings flutter behind her, &quot;Bring it,&quot; she says.<br /><br />Horns appear on Dave's head, his massive wings appear behind him, his hand grow sharp talons, he licks his lips as his eyes travel down her body, &quot;Once I beat you up I'm going to take my sweet time violating that body,&quot; he says before charging at her.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Russell puts a blanket around Quinn's shoulders before tucking her under his arm, &quot;You look so much like your mother Quinn,&quot; he tells her, &quot;She looked just like you when I first saw her, when I first wanted her,&quot; he whispers against her ear.<br /><br />Quinn clamps her eyes shut, 'Oh god no, please no' she prays. <br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Jesse cackles as Rachel tries to push him off of her, he moves forward, and licks Rachel's face, &quot;I think Russie boy is about to show Quinny a good time,&quot; he says, he laughs again only to have it cut short.<br /><br />Rachel's eyes start harden and she disappears leaving him kneeling on the ground.<br /><br />&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; he exclaims getting on his feet.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Dave and Santana charge at each other, dirt and leaves flying behind them, Santana hits him on the face, as he scratches at her torso, &quot;You look good with red, ever think of switching teams?&quot; he tells her licking her blood off of his hand.<br /><br />&quot;You have to do better than that buddy boy,&quot; she says as she assumes a defensive position.<br /><br />They go at each other, kicking, punching and dodging; it was a blur of red and white, the demon and the angel.<br /><br />&quot;When I'm done with you, I'll do the same thing to Rachel,&quot; he says maliciously, &quot;and then I'll take my sweet time with Quinny, she's a hot piece of ass that one,&quot; he adds.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Are you still cold Princess?&quot;<br /><br />Quinn just nods her head, not trusting her voice.<br /><br />&quot;Come outside with me, let&rsquo;s get some wood for the fire,&quot; he tells her, &quot;I find it oddly stimulating,&quot; he whispers to himself.<br /><br />She catches the gleam in his eyes, reminding her of times when she'd hear noises from her parents room. She tries not to flinch as he grabs her arm, half leading, half dragging her out of the cabin.<br /><br />'I need to get out of here' she tells herself.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Where do you think you're going Rachel?&quot; Jesse says grabbing Rachel by the hair, &quot;We're not done, we're far from done.&quot;<br /><br />She slaps his hand away and disappears, a few feet away they appear near the edge of a cliff.<br /><br />&quot;Get off me!&quot; Rachel pushes him away; Jesse lunges forward, grabbing Rachel by the arms.<br /><br />&quot;That bitch will get what she deserves Rachel, don't you remember 'Honor thy father and thy mother', clearly she forgot her father when she sent him to jail. It's only right Russell shows her, her place,&quot; he tells her in an all knowing voice.<br /><br />Rachel pushes him so hard, he was an inch away from the edge, &quot;He got what he deserved, and more. He hurt my Quinn,&quot; she says.<br /><br />&quot;Your Quinn?&quot; He howls as his wings sprout from behind him, his horns grow, &quot;let's see how perfect you'd still think she is once I'm done with her,&quot; and with that statement he disappears.<br /><br />--<br /><br />&quot;I so wish I could just end your existence,&quot; Dave tells her kicking her hard, &quot;Lucky for you, I have a job to do,&quot; he adds smirking.<br /><br />&quot;Walking away? You've always been such a coward,&quot; says Santana buffing her nails against her blood stained shirt, she crouches low the moment the atmosphere around her changes, 'so predictable' she thinks to herself as he charges at her.<br /><br />&quot;Coward! I'll show you cowa--&quot; he looks down finding a dagger lanced into his side, &quot;You Bitch!&quot; he screams pulling it out and screaming in agony.<br /><br />Santana smirks, &quot;Oh did I forget to tell you? I was reassigned? Defender Santana at your service,&quot; she says with a bow before turning around.<br /><br />She falls down on her knees as a burning sensation from behind her.<br /><br />&quot;Does it hurt Santy?&quot; he asks as he twists the knife before pulling it out and plunging it down again, &quot;It burns doesn't it?&quot; <br /><br />Santana falls to the ground, her wings fold behind her, what was once immaculate white was now tinged with red. She coughs once, and blood seep down her mouth.<br /><br />&quot;I'll be back my lovely, I promise I'll show you a good time,&quot; he coos before kicking her hard and disappearing.<br /><br />Santana tries to get up as tears roll down her face.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Jesse is blinded by a burst of light, causing him to come hurtling stopping only to crash against a large tree trunk, he tries to move only to find himself stuck.<br /><br />&quot;You dare hurt her?&quot; he hears Rachel say as she glides closer to him.<br /><br />His eyes widen, Rachel was aglow. Energy crackling about. Her eyes white. She was blinding, beautiful. terrifying.<br /><br />&quot;Rachel,&quot; he rasps as turbulent wind pin him further into the trunk.<br /><br />Rachel looks at him as if disinterested, &quot;Call him off,&quot; she commands eerily, &quot;Call him off, and I'll let you go.&quot;<br /><br />Jesse balks at this, &quot;I can't Rach.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Call him off now!&quot; she screams.<br /><br />A ball of light grow bigger, emanating from her heart. It swallows both of them whole.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Russell pauses from chopping wood to watch Quinn as she gathers up some wood, 'Just like Judy,' he thinks to himself.<br /><br />He raises the axe to chop some more, only to drop it when a loud booming sound cuts the silence around the cabin; he turns around only to squint at the sudden burst of light that exploded in the woods.<br /><br />The strong gust of wind hits both Quinn and Russell so suddenly, they didn't have time to ready themselves. It throws Russell a few feet away, hitting the side of his van hard, while Quinn who was crouched rolls across the ground.<br /><br />Both lie still. <br /><br />Quinn was safe, for now.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Jesse lowers his arm, and finds Rachel kneeling on the ground breathing heavily; he spies Dave creeping behind her and tries to stop himself from grinning.<br /><br />Dave leaps towards Rachel, only she meets him head on, they fly apart both of them hit rock walls in opposite directions.<br /><br />He regains his bearings first.<br /><br />&quot;Dave my friend, a little help please,&quot; he hears Jesse scream, &quot;Quickly while Rachel is down for the count.&quot;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn whimpers and slowly lifts herself off of the ground; she sees her father slumped against the van, unconscious.<br /><br />'Thank you, thank you' she prays.<br /><br />She gets on her feet, and once steady enough she makes a break for it, running towards the woods, towards the flash of light.<br /><br />It was calling to her, she knew, somewhere there, she'd be safe.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Rachel opens her eyes, and they widen when she feels her heart beating, calling to her, calling out for her.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn,&quot; she whispers as she places a hand on her chest.<br /><br />She stretches her wings and flies, she'd keep her safe, she'd protect her, whatever it took.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Wake up Russell,&quot; Jesse whispers, &quot;Your princess is getting away, you don't want that do you?&quot; he adds.<br /><br />Dave and Jesse smile as Russell groans and opens his eyes.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn?&quot; he says out loud, when he doesn't see her anywhere he stands up and goes into the cabin.<br /><br />&quot;Show her who the man is Russell, nobody disrespect Russell Fabray,&quot; Dave eggs on.<br /><br />Russell appears at the door with a gun in hand, &quot;Come out, come out wherever you are princess, Don't make me hurt you!&quot; He bellows.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn hears her father's booming voice, and scrambles to find a place to hide. She scolds herself for not grabbing a weapon, anything that she could use to protect herself.<br /><br />She berates herself for not continuing her self defense classes with Seth.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Can I go teach that Santy a lesson now?&quot; Dave asks shakily as he puts pressure on his wound, he was getting weaker, and he knew he needs to get back to HQ soon.<br /><br />Jesse looks at him with a raised brow, &quot;We have a job to do.,&quot; he says icily.<br /><br />&quot;As do I,&quot; Rachel says before charging at them, she tackles Dave to the ground and Punches him with all that she has. His head lolls to the side, and Rachel looks down at him with remorse, she puts a hand on his cheek and whispers, &quot;I'm sorry Dave, I am.&quot;<br /><br />Lost in her internal turmoil, she forgot about Jesse.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Where the hell are you, you little bitch!&quot; Screams Russell.<br /><br />He curses at how dark the sky had become, &quot;You better pray to God I don't find you, cause when I do, You'll be begging me to kill you instead!&quot;<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn crouches low, she could hear him, and he was getting closer. She's starting to panic, she was sure she was going in circles. She wipes away her tears knowing crying wasn't going to do her any good.<br /><br />She then remembers the van; she could use it to escape.<br /><br />'Please let this work, please' she prays.<br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Jesse's blood boil as he watched Rachel touch Dave, he didn't want Rachel touching anyone that wasn't him. When she sees her lean down to whisper her apologies mumbling about how it was for Quinn, he sees red, and stalks over to her. He stalks on over to her and thrusts his hand out closing his hand, and in a few seconds he closes his hand around the axe handle. <br /><br />His eyes turn black as coal, and he evilly smiles as he imagines cutting of her wings, 'I&rsquo;ll cut off your wings for you Rachel so you can finally be with your precious Quinn, ' he thinks to himself. Just as he swings he finds himself tackled from the left, hitting his head against a rock knocking him out cold.<br /><br />Rachel scrambles to Santana's side, putting her hand on her wound, &quot;Santana, you need to get back, you have to go back.&quot; she says, trying not to cry.<br /><br />&quot;I promised, I said I'd always protect you,&quot; mumbles Santana coughing up more blood.<br /><br />Rachel shakes her head, as tears run down her face, &quot;Santa--&quot; she says cut short by the sound of gunshot.<br /><br />&quot;Go,&quot; Santana whispers trying to keep her eyes open.<br /><br />&quot;But you need--,&quot; Rachel tries to say, but Santana shushes her.<br /><br />&quot;Go,&quot; she says again, &quot;she needs you,&quot; she says softly.<br /><br />&quot;Wait for me, I'll come back for you,&quot; she whispers before kissing Santana's forehead.<br /><br />She nods her head and finally lets her eyes close when Rachel disappears, &quot;I'll try,&quot; she mumbles.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn moves as quickly and quietly as she could, she looks around and sighs I relief when she doesn't see her father anywhere. She wasn't sure how far she was from the cabin, it's been awhile since she had been there, and she wanted to cry at the idea that she might just be actually lost in the woods, with her father trailing after her in a mad rage. She hears a twig snap, and whips her head toward the sound, she finds nothing there, her shoulders sag and she starts moving again.<br /><br />She stops when she hears the sound of a gun being cocked, Her heart thunders in her chest, 'No, no, no, no, please no,' she prays.<br /><br />&quot;I don't want to hurt you Quinn,&quot; Russell says evenly, &quot;So come to daddy,&quot; he adds.<br /><br />Quinn makes a run for it ducking behind a large tree, she could hear how close he was and she knew it was the end of her, &quot;You disappoint me Quinn, I thought you were my princess, but now I see you really are just like your mother. You're just dying for a lesson too, aren't you?&quot;<br /><br />The last sentence frightens her so much, she runs as fast as she could flinching at the sound of the gun going off, she looks back and finds her father hot on her trail, she keeps running, weaving in between trees, and rocks fearing for her life.<br /><br />&quot;Stop right this instant Quinn, or I will shoot you,&quot; he screams.<br /><br />But she doesn't stop, she can't.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Jesse Groans and touches the side of his head, he sits up and his gaze falls on Dave and Santana, He knew both had little time left, he unsteadily walks over to Dave. Once there he looks out into the distance and whispers, &quot;Make her pay Russell, make her pay,&quot; He turns his gaze towards Dave and frowns, &quot;You are so useless sometimes,&quot; he says before they both disappear into thin air.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&nbsp;Rachel finds herself a few feet away from Quinn, she hears Russell's frustrated curse as Quinn kept on moving, she distinctly heard the sound of the gun being cocked. She didn't think, she just moved. She barrels towards him silently urging Quinn to keep running, she didn't care that his gun was pointed straight at her, didn't think that it could still do some damage to her, she only knew one thing, she had to keep Quinn safe, so she looks at Russell then at the gun, she delivers a blow unto his wrist, knocking down the gun in the process.<br /><br />&quot;What the hell?!&quot; He exclaims, shaking his hand in pain, he wonders what the hell it was.<br /><br />He feels something come closer, it's presence heavy, just like all the other times he would think of getting his revenge, times when his thoughts were not just thoughts, times when he would actually take action, like when he set fire to that judge's house knowing he was inside, or that time he poisoned that cop.<br /><br />Only this time, he was afraid. <br /><br />&quot;You should be,&rdquo; was whispered to his ear, and he twirls around looking for the owner of the voice, &quot;It's time to pay your dues Russell,&quot; he hears from behind him, and he turns again.<br /><br />&quot;Show yourself you demon!&quot; he screams, he moves looking from one side to the other, turning whenever a foreign sound reaches his ears. The hair at the back of his head rise, and dread flows down his body when he hears the chuckled response.<br /><br />&quot;I find that between the two of us, you are quite closer to being a demon than I ever could,&quot; the way it was said made him freeze, if only for a minute. He stumbles backwards only to fall as he tripped on his own feet. He scrambles for the gun, and points it at any direction he could, going round in circles.<br /><br />&quot;Drop it,&quot; he hears the voice behind him, he is startled by this prompting him to turn and shoot, the sound of shot echoing in the woods.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn keeps running, something, someone was telling her to run. So she did, she was running alongside the river, behind her the sun was already setting, and she knew it was only a matter of time before darkness will shroud the woods, she had to get back to the cabin, she had to get there quick.<br /><br />She hears the gun shot, and she feels a sharp pain on the side other shoulder. It was so distinct, and so unexpected that she screams, falters in her step and falls into the raging river beside her.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Rachel touches her shoulder gritting her teeth.&nbsp; The bullet grazed her shoulder and the pain was not as intense, but the feeling acute to rage did. She stalks over to Russell, and smiles a little as his eyes grow large as she finally appears before him, with her wings outstretched.<br /><br />But her rage was short lived. She heard Quinn scream, and felt her utter terror. &quot;Quinn,&quot; she whispers before taking flight, Russell would get what was coming to him but right now her ward needed her.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Russell falls to his knees; he couldn't believe what he just saw. <br />He could sense heavy footsteps behind him and he turns his head, and his eyes widen at the sight of another winged creature smiling evilly at him.<br /><br />&quot;Hello Russell,&quot; it said.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />She tries to keep her head afloat, she spies a fallen tree and tries to steer her body that way. She swims as hard as she could, but she was tired, so so tired. <br /><br />'swim Quinn, swim!' she tells herself as she paddles and kicks as much as her tired body could, her torso hits the trunk hard, and she takes heaving breaths in relief. her eyes are starting to close, and her body was starting to shut down. It was so cold, and her body just seemed so close to giving up. Her hand slips, and before she knew it she was once again carried by the raging waters.<br /><br />She screams, and water fills her mouth then her lungs, she flails her arms getting her head above water, she sputters and looks to the sky, she vaguely sees wings before an undercurrent pulls her down.<br /><br />She was sure she heard her name being screamed before all she could hear was water, everywhere.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;Where are you,&quot; Rachel whispers under her breath. She keeps her eyes on the raging waters, shivering knowing how cold it was, the sun was almost fully gone. and the sky was starting to be tinged blue.<br /><br />She notices a blonde head clinging to a fallen tree, just as she was close enough to swoop down, Quinn's hand loses its grip and Rachel could only watch in horror as she disappears again.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn!&quot; she screams as she swoops down and dives into the water.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Russell struggles to move away, as the man in front of him move closer and closer, &quot;No need to be afraid Russell, we are after all old friends,&quot; he says grinning.<br /><br />&quot;Stay away from me! What the hell are you?!&quot; he screams, trying to get up on his feet.<br /><br />Stretching his wings, Jesse smirks, &quot;Hell? that's where I come from, and I can't stay away,&quot; he says slowly, &quot;I need you after all,&quot; he adds before he turns into smoke, smoke that enters Russell's open mouth, and ears and nose. His eyes grow wider, and his scream dies in his throat, his body collapses on the ground and convulses in pain.<br /><br />For a few seconds he lies still, before jumping to his feet, and rolling his neck and smiling at the popping sounds he gets, &quot;As filthy and disgusting being in your body is Russell, I feel as if I will be quite satisfied with using it.&quot;<br /><br />He bends forward and grabs the gun, twirling it like in old western movies, he assumes a shooting stance and makes 'bang bang' noises, he blows on the barrel of the gun before walking to the direction of the river.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Rachel springs from the raging water with Quinn cradled in her arms, the blonde unconscious, and a lot paler than usual. She lands not so gracefully on the other side of the river, she drops down to her knees and gently places Quinn on the ground. <br /><br />&quot;Quinn,&quot; she whispers shaking the blonde's body gently. She frowns upon seeing the blue lips her ward was sporting. She tries to feel for a pulse and tries to check if she was breathing, but her hands are shaking so bad not from the cold but the possibility of failing Quinn. She can barely see through her tears and the water from the river. She calls her name again, desperately praying that she wake up. <br /><br />Quinn starts coughing the minute she opens her eyes, she didn't even realize she had closed them. She looks at her, drowning in the presence of her, the very thought that she was here with Quinn, they were together again after all this time, even if the circumstances surrounding their reunion was not ideal, even if Quinn didn't know who she was. The only thing she was concerned with was that Quinn was safe, she saved her, she was alive, she didn't fail.<br /><br />She smiles as Quinn blinks and looks up at her, whispering one word that made her forget everything except Quinn.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Her body was cold, her lungs hurt and she was exhausted. And as Quinn kept coughing she doesn't register the hand that was palming her cheek, all she knew was she felt safe, that she was safe. It brings her to a time when she was younger, a time that always seemed like a haze to her. She tries so hard to open her eyes.<br /><br />What she sees made her glad she did. A beautiful brunette was hovering above her, with tears in her eyes, but a smile gracing her lips. She'd never seen anything as beautiful as her, she was so moved, so entranced by her that she lifts up a hand to trace her face.<br /><br />&quot;Angel,&quot; she whispers. The smile grows larger, and everything seemed brighter. She wanted to stay awake, she wanted to stay with this creature in front of her, she wasn't sure if she was still alive, or if she was drowning, or if she was just dreaming. The brunette looked like the girl from her dreams, the girl she drew in her books hidden underneath her bed.<br /><br />She fights her exhaustion, tries to keep her eyes open. But it was a fruitless endeavor, she closes her eyes with a smile, the last thing she saw was the angel in her dreams.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />As Rachel watches Quinn succumb to sleep, a small smile on her lips she can't help but cry some more, &quot;Oh Quinn,&quot; she whispers as she kisses the girls forehead.<br /><br />She once again takes the girl in her arms and takes flight, Santana needed to go home.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Jesse watches as Rachel takes flight, he looks on in disgust as Rachel gently cradles the human in her arms, he could feel Russell flinch at the sight as well as his fear. He licks his lips loving the taste of it. As Rachel's majestic wings gracefully lift them away. He runs towards the cabin, he knew exactly what to do to win.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Rachel lowers Quinn to ground, and a fire starts behind her where the fire pit lay. She looks at Quinn one last time and whispers, &quot;I'll be back Quinn,&quot; just as she was about to turn around, the air grows colder, and she covers Quinn with her wings in reflex. The pain she feels after is enough to make her cry out in pain, once, twice, thrice. She looks down at Quinn and was glad she was unharmed, and undisturbed.<br /><br />She turns around, and<br />&nbsp;finds Russell Fabray pointing the gun at them, she walks over to him only to falter a little when his smirk reminded her of Jesse.<br /><br />&quot;Did it hurt my nightingale?&quot; he asks smiling evilly at her.<br /><br />Rachel moves closer, &quot;Jesse,&quot; she whispers.<br /><br />He advances at her, and hits her square on the jaw and takes pleasure in watching her stumble to her knees. He delivers a swift kick to her stomach and laughs as she doubles over in pain.<br /><br />&quot;Fight back,&quot; he screams, &quot;Fight back bitch!&quot;<br /><br />She defends herself from his blows, as much as she wanted to; she had already crossed so many lines. And she couldn't find it in herself to actually harm this human, regardless if he has done such evil things, regardless if Jesse was inside of him. He was still human, and she was still an angel.<br /><br />&quot;Fight back Rachel!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Stop it Jesse, stop it.&quot; she says desperately avoiding his blows. She was growing tired; she could see Santana from her vantage point and knew she had to get to her quickly.<br /><br />&quot;He hurt your precious human, he was going to do evil things to her, he was going to take advantage of her, don't you want him to pay,&quot; he says as he finally stops raining punches and kicks at Rachel.<br /><br />Rachel keeps her arms up ready to defend herself, &quot;It is not my job to mete out justice, however tempted I might be, not like this, never like this.&quot; she says.<br /><br />&quot;He hurt you!&quot; he screams in frustration, he could not break her, he never could.<br /><br />&quot;All thanks to you, and your meddling,&quot; she answers.<br /><br />He leaves Russell's body as quickly as he invaded it, Russell convulses once again, and when he sees both winged creatures standing in front of him, Rachel turns to him, her rage was alluring, it was calling to her. She moves closer only stopping when she hears him whimper, &quot;she deserved it,&quot; she then raises her hand palm facing Russell, &quot;Feel,&quot; she whispers, &quot;Feel for a moment what your wife and children felt in your presence,&quot; he bursts into tears, pleading for forgiveness, for mercy and giving false promises.<br /><br />This disgusts Jesse in the process, &quot;Pathetic,&quot; he spits out before moving forward and placing his hand on his head, &quot;Sleep,&quot; he says stepping over Russell's body as he approaches Rachel, &quot;You are not as pure as you think you are Rachel,&quot; he says evenly. <br /><br />&quot;I never said I was, but I unlike you regret what I just did,&quot; she tells him solemnly, backing away from him.<br /><br />They hear Santana whimper, and Rachel turns towards her at the sound. Jesse takes this moment to grab Rachel by her injured wings, he pulls as hard as he could and laughs at the sound of bone breaking.<br /><br />Rachel's scream pierces the silence in the woods.<br /><br />Jesse catches her before she could fall, &quot;I did what you wanted Rachel, I did exactly what you wanted,&quot; he tells her before giving her a kiss, disappearing as he does taking Russell with him.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Santana's eyes open at the sound of Rachel's scream, she curses herself for being so careless, for being so sure of herself that she forgot Dave fought dirty, her wound was healing but not as fast as it would had she been in heaven, she tries to sit up only to fall back down, she could spot Rachel's slumped form and notices the odd angles her wings were.<br /><br />&quot;No,&quot; she croaks as she crawls over to her friend, finding strength hidden deep within, &quot;Rach,&quot; she whimpers.<br /><br />Rachel turns her head, eyes filled with pain, regret and fear, &quot;Santana, don't!&quot; she reprimands her voice strained, sluggishly moving towards her friend, she slumps down beside her, and she grabs the taller girl's face in her hand, &quot;You need to get home,&quot; was her pained whisper.<br /><br />&quot;Your wings Rachel,&quot; Santana says, &quot;What happened to your wings?&quot; she asks.<br /><br />Rachel shakes her head and instead repeats herself, &quot;You need to get home.&quot;<br /><br />Before Santana could say more, they were floating, a bright ball of light holding them together.<br /><br />&quot;Rachel! NO! I won't let you do this, you can't do this!&quot; Santana utters angrily, she was so tired and the pain was becoming unbearable, but the price Rachel would pay in exchange for what she was doing now, it was too much, she couldn't bear the thought of it.<br /><br />Rachel once again shakes her head, and rests her forehead against Santana's. She puts her hand on her wound, and sadly smiles. Santana could feel energy pulsing to her wound, &quot;You're my oldest and dearest friend Santana, thank you for everything,&quot; she tells her.<br /><br />&quot;Rachel, don't please don't do this,&quot; she pleads. Slowly her strength was increasing, and she knew Rachel was getting weaker.<br /><br />&quot;I'll miss you Santana,&quot; Rachel tells her holding her close, before letting her go.<br /><br />&quot;Nooooooo!&quot; Santana screams reaching out for Rachel.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />From a distance a ball of light was increasing in altitude, before it splits into two, going separate ways before disappearing.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />&quot;I'll be there soon Quinn,&rdquo; Rachel whispers hoarsely as she falls down, her wings flapping uselessly behind her, she closes her eyes and whispers, <br />&quot;and I'll never leave again,&quot; she doesn't turn to look at the direction she was going; instead she closes her eyes and accepts her fate.<br /><br />She hits the ground hard she doesn't feel the pain; all she knows is that Quinn was there with her and she was safe. She drifts of knowing she was where she had to be.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Santana finds herself reaching out for Rachel, screaming her name only to be in coach&rsquo;s arms. &quot;Coach, send me back, please send me back!&quot; she pleads, &quot;They're too strong, they won't make it. I have to go back,&quot; she begs as Sue holds her close wondering for the first time if they did the right thing.<br /><br />-o-o-o-o-<br /><br />Quinn moves closer to the source of heat and wonders why she wasn't under the covers, she is startled awake by the sound of an owl in the distance, she sits up straight and remembers everything, whipping her head round, she searches for her father and instead finds the girl that saved her, a few feet away. She moves closer to the girl, and sighs in relief when she sees her breathing. <br /><br />She sees a patch of blood on her shoulder, exactly where Quinn felt herself hurt prior to falling into the river. She also notices the wound on her head. She shakily gets on her feet, and tries to lift the small girl towards the van. She was glad the doors were unlocked and was mildly disappointed the keys were not in sight.<br /><br />She gently lays the girl down on the passenger seat, and spots her bag on the floor; she grabs it and runs to the driver's side. She begins to hot wire the car and smiles as it sputters to life &quot;Thank you Leroy,&quot; she whispers, as she drives away, trying to remember how to get home, she grabs her phone and thanks God that her father was not smart enough to throw it away.<br /><br />She calls the first number on her call list, &quot;Quinn?! I've been searching all over for you, my mom has been practically crawling on walls, until she got called away for a case she couldn't drop. Where the hell are you?!?&quot; Brittany screams at her.<br /><br />&quot;My dad kidnapped me Britt, but I'm ok, she saved me,&quot; she tells her as she maneuvers her way out of the woods.<br /><br />&quot;Who Quinn?&quot; Brittany asks.<br /><br />&quot;I don't know,&quot; she answers, &quot;But she seems familiar,&quot; the last part was whispered mostly to herself as she looks at the slumbering girl beside her, &quot;I'll figure out where to go Britt and I'll call you again, she's hurt and needs a hospital,&quot; she ends the call not bothering to pick up when her phone starts ringing again.<br /><br />She'd have a lot to answer when she finally sees everyone, she can only imagine how her mother would feel, and Alexis too. But right now, for some reason she felt safe. For some reason she wasn't thinking about her father, or the fact that he kidnapped her and was alluding to things she never wants to think about. <br /><br />All she knew was that this girl saved her life, and she didn't even know her, didn't know her name, but she's never felt more safe, adored and guarded in her entire life, she grabs her scarf and tries to wrap it around the girls head, &quot;who are you,&quot; she whispers.<br /><br />TBC<br /><br />So there you go folks, did it answer some of your questions?<br /><br /><br /></span></p></lj-cut>"

Still dazed that she had just made out with Quinn Fabray, and it was wonderful, it was beautiful, it was amazing and if she had a pen and paper in hand she'd be writing song, sonnets, poems and a phenomenological essay on making out with Quinn Fabray.<br /><br />She grins and kicks her legs against the mattress before grabbing a pillow and smothering her scream with it. I just made out with Quinn Fabray and it was legen-wait for it- dary! She takes a deep breath and goofily smiles once the smell of Quinn's shampoo and perfume assaults her olfactory system which in turn triggers a massive short circuiting of all her neurons. She lies in bed, clutching a pillow with her eyes closed and a dopey smile plastered on her lips.<br /><br />&quot;RACHEL!MY WATER JUST BROKE!&quot; she hears Quinn scream.<br /><br />This propels her to be on her feet on top of the bed in a second; she tries to jump out of the bed and almost tumbles to the floor when her foot gets stuck on the comforter on the bed.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn! Calm down. Calm down ok?&quot; she says rather loudly while scrambling for pants, shorts or sweats anything she can put on really. She practiced this scenario in her head; in the freak chance that Quinn suddenly went on labor in her presence she had catalogued a number of responses and game plans.<br /><br />Running around the hotel room half naked with swollen lips and make out hair was not one of them.<br /><br />Quinn's giggles snap her out of her manic search for pants.<br /><br />She turns her head and was about to scowl at the blonde when she notices the pool of liquid at her feet. This spring's her into action making a beeline for the closet.<br /><br />Of course the closet, where else would all the clothes be. She thinks she can blame Quinn for her state, apparently making out with Quinn Fabray ends all rational and normal Rachel Berry thoughts and leaves her in a stupefied lovesick state.<br /><br />&quot;Baby, I really need you right now.&quot; she hears Quinn's quivering voice.<br /><br />That's all she needs to get dressed, get Quinn changed and wrapped in a jacket to keep warm, and out of the door before you can even say &quot;Holy shit Quinn Fabray and I just totally made out, then her water just broke and she just called me baby.&quot; BOOYAH!<br /><br />&quot;NOAH PUCKERMAN!&quot; she screams the minute they were out the door, to try and catch the baby daddy's attention. True enough the mow hawked boy pokes his head out from his room. Followed by eleven other heads the last being Mr. Schue's whose eyes bug out so much, Rachel was afraid they'd fall off.<br /><br />&quot;It's time; we need to get Quinn to the hospital right now.&quot; She says while helping said girl gently but briskly walk to the elevator, when Puck stays stupefied at his door Rachel bristles with anger, &quot;NOW PUCKERMAN!&quot; she screams at him.<br /><br />It was at that moment that Santana runs past them to slap some sense into the gawking boy, &quot;Dude, now is the best time to join the class.&quot; she tells him scowling before running ahead and pressing the down button for the elevator.<br /><br />They were all inside the elevator when Quinn's first contraction hit.<br /><br />&quot;THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT PUCK! I NEVER SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED YOU WHEN YOU SAID TRUST ME!&quot; Quinn screams at him, her nails digging into his arms.<br /><br />&quot;Shhh its ok Quinn breathe with me, just like this hoo hoo hee, hoo hoo hee.&quot; Rachel tells her gently rubbing circles on her back, pretty soon everyone in the elevator is hoo hoo heeing along with Quinn.<br /><br />&quot;Jesus Quinn, I have scratch marks all over my arms and I didn't even get it while having sex.&quot; Puck exclaims after seeing all of the scratches Quinn gave him.<br /><br />Rachel's eyes narrow at this, Puck was really starting to get on her nerves, &quot;Shut it Puckerman!&quot; she hisses at him.<br /><br />Puck scowls at her at this, &quot;Who the fuck left you in charge Berry? That's my baby about to be born right there, this doesn't fucking concern you.&quot;<br /><br />Before anyone could react, Quinn had kicked Puck in the nads and grabbing a fistful of mow hawk. With gritted teeth she pulls his head close to her face, &quot;Never ever speak to my Rachel that way ever again Puck or I swear I will cut it off using a plastic spoon and make you eat it slowly!&quot;<br /><br />Then the elevator doors open. And everyone scrambles out except except Finn.<br /><br />&quot;Did Quinn just say my Rachel?&quot; he asks out loud, Kurt turns around and just drags him to the exit.<br /><br />&quot;There are more pressing matters to think of Finn. What Quinn may or may not have uttered is not what we should be worried about.&quot; he says, his gaze falls on Puck being dragged by his Mohawk by a very distressed and angry Quinn Fabray.<br /><br />&quot;Let go of the hawk Quinn.&quot; he screams.<br /><br />&quot;Fuck you Puckerman! You don't want me scratching you, so I'll settle for the hawk.&quot; Quinn screams back.<br /><br />&quot;It's better than her grabbing your balls Quinn does have an awesome grip.&quot; Mercedes quips smirking at the pale color the resident stud was sporting.<br /><br />Pretty soon they're all loaded in the bus headed for the closest hospital.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn, I've called your mother she's on her way.&quot; says Mr. Schue while helping her down the bus.<br /><br />Quinn nods her head before whispering a thank you before reaching out a hand to Rachel, &quot;Rachel I want you with me. Don't leave ok?&quot; she says.<br /><br />&quot;Nowhere I'd rather be Quinn.&quot; she whispers against her ear.<br /><br />The minute they pass through the emergency door, they hear Judy Fabray frantically looking for Quinn.<br /><br />&quot;Mom, I'm scared.&quot; Quinn tells her the minute Judy wraps her in an embrace.<br /><br />&quot;It's ok Quinny, mommy's here.&quot; Then they were off Quinn in a wheelchair, Puck pushing her and Rachel running right beside them hand clasped in Quinn's<br /><br />&quot;My daughter is having her baby.&quot; Judy tells one of the nurses. In just a matter of minutes, Quinn is in a room and in a hospital gown.<br /><br />&quot;Mommy, I don't think I can do this.&quot; cries Quinn, clutching her mother's in one hand and Rachel's in the other.<br /><br />Judy Fabray just wipes at her brow, &quot;Yes you can sweetheart, the minute you see your baby all of this will be worth it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Baby girl.&quot; whispers Quinn, she was just so tired.<br /><br />&quot;It's a girl?&quot; asks her mother with a proud smile.<br /><br />Quinn nods and then screams, &quot;FUCK!WHY?WHY DOES IT HURT SO FUCKING MUCH!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Look at me Quinn, look at me. Just breathe like we've been doing.&quot; Rachel says, and soon enough Quinn is calm but tired.<br /><br />&quot;We're almost there Quinn, you're baby's almost crowning and any moment now you'll meet your daughter.&quot;<br /><br />Quinn spies Puck move toward the doctor who was in between her legs.<br /><br />&quot;DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT NOAH PUCKERMAN!&quot; Quinn screams at him, and then another contraction hit.<br /><br />&quot;YOU SUCK, YOU SUCK, YOU SUCK, YOU SUCK, YOU SUCK, YOU FUCKING SUCK!&quot; she screams in succession, grabbing unto Rachel's hand, &quot;YOU ARE NEVER EVER COMING NEAR ME WITH WINE COOLERS EVER AGAIN! AND DON'T YOU EVEN DARE THINK OF DOING THE SAME TO MY RACHEL!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You're doing great Quinn, I want you to push on the next one ok?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;GOOOOODDDD IT HURTS!&quot; she screams<br /><br />&quot;Push Quinn, just push.&quot; says the doctor.<br /><br />&quot;I AM PUSHING, I&quot;M PUSHING GOD DAMMIT!&quot; she screams at her, before collapsing back to the bed.<br /><br />&quot;Good girl, your baby's excited to meet you.&quot; the doctor smiles, used to hearing all sorts of things during delivery.<br /><br />&quot;You're doing great Quinny,&quot; her mom tells her while wiping away her sweat.<br /><br />&quot;You're so amazing Quinn, so beautiful.&quot; Rachel murmurs and Quinn looks at her tiredly.<br /><br />&quot;I look horrible I'm all sweaty and so tired Rachel.&quot; she tells her.<br /><br />&quot;Nope still breathtakingly beautiful. Even in a hospital gown that leaves little to the imagination. It's a good thing you're on your back cause if not I'd be seeing your backside not that your umm assets aren't amazing they are and now I'm rambling.&quot; she takes a breath to control herself before speaking again. &quot;You take my breath away. And pretty soon you'll have an equally beautiful daughter in your arms.&quot; Rachel answers with a kiss to her forehead.<br /><br />She smiles before groaning again &quot;Oh God.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Push ok Quinn.&quot; The doctor instructs here. &quot;Just a few more big pushes and we'll be all done.&quot;<br /><br />The scream she lets out both during and after her contraction, scares Puck who seems almost halfway to unconsciousness.<br /><br />&quot;Her head is out, Good job Quinn, one more big push after your next contraction and you'll have your baby girl in your arms in no time.&quot; says the doctor.<br /><br />&quot;I'm so so tired Rachel, So tired.&quot; she strains to say, forgetting everything else but brown eyes locked with hers.<br /><br />&quot;I know Quinn, but you can do this. I believe in you. I want to meet your daughter, I can't wait to meet her, I'm pretty sure she's excited to meet you too? Just one more ok.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ok baby. Just don't leave me.&quot; she pleads, forgetting about Puck and her mother.<br /><br />&quot;Of course baby, like I said no place else I'd rather be, you're stuck with me.&quot; Rachel was equally unaffected by their presence.<br /><br />&quot;Promise?&quot; she asks vulnerably.<br /><br />&quot;Even better, a berry guarantee.&quot; was Rachel's answer before giving her a sweet kiss.<br /><br />&quot;One last big push ok?&quot; the doctor says, ready to help ease the delivery.<br /><br />Quinn screams even louder and pushes with all her might.<br /><br />&quot;And she's out! Good job Quinn.&quot; the doctor says, &quot;And just relax while we take care of your placenta.&quot; turning over to Puck, &quot;Would you like to cut the cord daddy?&quot; she asks, Puck starts walking forward after a small nod from Quinn, but as soon as he sees the blood he faints rather ungracefully almost hitting the doctor and narrowly missing. &quot;Umm yeah never mind.&quot; the doctor clamps the cord, cuts it and then hands the baby over to one of the nurses to get cleaned up.<br /><br />&quot;Rachel, why isn't my baby crying? Mom? Why is she so quiet.&quot; Quinn asks distressed. In all of the movies she seen where there was a child being born involved the baby cries almost as soon as it's finally born.<br /><br />She sinks down to the bed in relief once she hears her baby cry.<br /><br />&quot;Good set of lungs on her.&quot; the nurse cleaning up the baby says. And in just a few minutes she turns around carrying a pink bundle walking over to Quinn, &quot;Here you go mommy.&quot;<br /><br />And as the baby was placed on her arms, she doesn't even stop the tears in her eyes or the smile on her face. Her daughter was perfect.<br /><br />&quot;Hi there Beth, I'm your mommy.&quot; she whispers while tracing her daughter's face with a finger. &quot;You are so beautiful.&quot; she whispers.<br /><br />&quot;She's perfect just like you are.&quot; whispers Rachel watching as Quinn memorized each and every detail of the tiny girl in her arms.<br /><br />&quot;Come here baby.&quot; she whispers to Rachel, &quot;This is my Rachel.&quot; she tells her daughter whose eyes were open and seemed to be looking around and smacks her lips a few times.<br /><br />&quot;Hi there sweetie.&quot; Rachel says gently with tears in her eyes, &quot;You're so beautiful just like Mommy.&quot; she runs a finger across a small hand and smiles as the tiny hand holds on to it, &quot;Just like mommy. Already stealing my heart before she even knows it.&quot; she says all the while locking eyes with Quinn.<br /><br />&quot;We're going to have to talk Rachel.&quot; Quinn tells her never breaking contact.<br /><br />&quot;I know. We'll talk soon but now let's just focus on Beth.&quot;<br /><br />They spend the next few minutes admiring the small child in Quinn's arms. And pretty soon a nurse comes in informing them that Beth was supposed to go the nursery. Her mother excuses herself to make a few phone calls and to speak to the other members of the club. Puck was still down for the count. And the doctor was done delivering the placenta, and was advising the nurse to transfer Quinn to a different room and to take care of Puck.<br /><br />As Quinn watches her daughter being taken away as she was being moved to another direction.<br /><br />Once they were alone.<br /><br />&quot;I want her here.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;She'll be here in your room before you know it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I know, I just miss her already. She's perfect isn't she?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;She is, just like you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Rachel...&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Just rest for awhile ok?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Don't leave.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I won't, I'll be right here when you wake up.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Promise?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A berry guarantee.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hold me, please.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I don't think it's a prudent course of action, Quinn! Don't pout, I don't think Puck or your mother will particularly like seeing us lying in the same bed. Quinn, please baby. I don't think, oh Alright I'll hold you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Thank you baby.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You're lucky I am very much enamored by you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You are?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes. Now sleep, we'll talk about it soon. But you need to rest.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;But, Rachel.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Rest baby please, you just had a very tiring night.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I'm pouting now, just so you know.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And it won't work because I am at the moment unable to see it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Can I at least get a kiss?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Quinn! Please you just gave birth. Try and get some rest, we'll talk soon, but right now I want and need you to rest.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Kiss me goodnight first.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Quinn.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Rachel.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Quinn Fabray, sleep.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Baby please...just one kiss and I'll sleep for as long as you want me too.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It's going to be a short nap, they'll be taking her back here for routine feeding and I'm pretty sure the hoard of gleeks that will come by is eminent.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;So kiss me quick so I can start resting.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You are so demanding. If I do kiss you, you'll go to sleep?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ok.&quot; *kiss* &quot;Now please close your eyes and sleep.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Thank you baby.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sleep now Quinn, please.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Stay ok?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I Promise I have no intention of going anywhere, I shall be staying right here. Now sleep.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sing me a song.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Quinn Fabray! You said you were going to sleep after I kissed you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will just sing me a song, so I can fall asleep. I like listening to your voice.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh, well when you put it that way, who am I to disregard such a request?&quot;<br /><br />And she gently sings a lullaby to lull Quinn to sleep, thinking of how beautiful she was, how amazing while giving birth. Her heart was bursting with so much emotion that Quinn didn't want her to leave her side. Her body charged at the fact that she was holding Quinn.<br /><br />The silence only broken when Puck saunters into the room along with all the other gleeks.<br /><br />&quot;BERRY WHY ARE YOU IN BED WITH MY BABY MAMA?&quot;<br /><br />And once again chaos ensued, or subdued chaos, after all Quinn just gave birth and they were still in the hospital. And pretty much everyone was in a state of shock anyway.<br /></span></lj-cut>"

And clipped too.<br /><br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""followed by billowy smoke from the shower she had just vacated"">They took regionals by storm if the amount of time the audience where giving them a standing ovation, Quinn was pretty sure they had won by a landslide ten times over.<br /><br />She was still giddy and high with the adrenaline pumping through her pregnant body. Only to wince in pain after feeling a particular swift kick to the kidney by her baby. It seemed like her baby was excited too.<br /><br />Her mother showing up backstage also added a different mix to the cocktail of emotions she was already feeling, her mother left her father, and her father cheated on her mother, and she was being asked to come home. All her life none of those days compared to the epicness of this day. She vaguely wonders if she was dreaming.<br /><br />Then she remembers Rachel, and the way her voice just made Quinn feel peace. She was way in over her head.<br /><br />Rubbing her baby bump, she hums any way you want it remembering how hot Rachel Berry looked while dancing. She was pretty sure she licked her lips while watching her ass sway to the music. Rachel was so sexy even when she wasn't trying.<br /><br />Then she hears the bathroom door open and almost chokes while taking a breath. It looked like a goddess just stepped out of the bathroom. Closing her eyes she counts to ten. Thinking that maybe she really was dreaming, even with all the excitement of regionals she's been pretty tired of late. And well she seems to be falling asleep at odd moments, yesterday she fell asleep while eating a BLT. Mercedes laughter was the only thing that woke her up.<br /><br />So she blinks, once, twice, thrice. As if to convince herself that she was indeed awake and not trapped in another one of her dreams. Since the beginning of the great pregnancy debacle of 2010, her dreams have been a pleasant scapegoat. not that she'd ever admit that it was, and she'll never ever tell anyone what she dreams about, but she knows for sure, puck would probably faint and drool, and Finn would think of millions of mailmen being hit by a million cars before probably fainting and drooling just like puck if they ever found out her hot and steamy dreams, not that it was all she ever dreamed about, there were non x rated dreams too. Ones that featured her running through central park, gazing at marquees with pride and stuff, but that was not the point.<br /><br />So here she was, blinking once, twice, thrice. Definitely sure she was awake. (She pinched herself twice, coupled with the awful back pain she's been experiencing all day and the incessant need to pee was there too, probably because drizzle or Beth well the baby was using her bladder as a pillow or a basketball and football, whichever comes first.) She's still unsure how to actually react to the situation.<br /><br />The situation being, Rachel Berry. specifically Rachel berry coming out of the shower in nothing but a small towel covering her *ehem* private areas, but showing off glorious tanned skin and legs that go on forever, with wet hair cascading down her back, with a few errant locks framing her delicate face, interestingly enough followed by billowy smoke from the shower she had just vacated.<br /><br />She feels her breath quicken along with the beat of her heart, or her bladder that her baby seems to think is a bongo. She isn't sure if she wants to curse Mr. Schue or thank him for rooming her with Rachel Berry. Pregnant women are known for their cravings not that he knew she was practically craving Rachel, and right now, it was as if she was Eve and the snake just showed her the red plump apple that was Rachel berry.<br /><br />The Rachel Berry that was oblivious to the strength of her stare. That nymph like creature that was humming a tune under her breath who now had one thigh on a stool, while her definitely non-man hands rubbed lotion on them. One leg after the other, from her foot up, high up under the towel.<br /><br />She forgets to breathe. For a minute or five and clutches at the comforter on the bed, when she watches as Rachel bends over to pull up cheerio red boy shorts. Cheerio red, her favorite color. Red, just like the apple that eve bit. The apple she would like to bite.<br /><br />She closes her eyes, shuts them tight trying to think of the un-sexiest thing she can think of, dead nuns, her parents, Puck, Finn, Sue Sylvester, Sue Sylvester and Mr. Schue, none of them worked. All she could see was long tanned legs, deep brown eyes and luscious lips. She opens her eyes and covers her mouth to bite her knuckles to cover the moan about to erupt from her lips.<br /><br />Rachel Berry was standing in front of her facing the only TV in the room in nothing but an oxford shirt. A men's size oxford shirt, that reached mid thigh.<br /><br />A sight to behold.<br /><br />Sin personified.<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />She was in deep doo-doo.<br /><br />She prays to all the saints and religious figures she knows that she didn't make that big of a sound.<br /><br />Rachel turns around and looks at her with worry and curiosity.<br /><br />Her prayers weren't answered.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn are you ok?&quot; Rachel asks her.<br /><br />&quot;I'm fine.&quot; she answers with a squeak.<br /><br />&quot;You don't seem fine. You look flushed, are you sure you're ok?' she was asked again, or maybe that was just in her head, all she could see was lips, legs and just a hint of cleavage. This shirt should be made illegal. She thinks to herself before all thoughts ceased to exist upon seeing Rachel Berry walk towards her, Jesus Christ girl got legs.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn? Are you feeling alright, you feel hot,&quot; was uttered, while a hand grazed her forehead.<br /><br />&quot;I'm OK.&quot; was the only thing she could articulate. When did her voice decide to lower a few ranges, and whoa did she just sound husky? She closes her eyes once again, unable to bring herself to see what Rachel's reaction would be<br /><br />Gentle fingers run through her hair, she leans her head towards that motion. When the same hand cups her face, she nuzzles said hand, unable to stop herself from doing so. Rachel makes her forget everything but the two of them; it was quite possible that Rachel was able to forget her own name too.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn...&quot; she hears, that was her right?<br /><br />&quot;Open your eyes, please...&quot; whispered against her face<br /><br />She opens her eyes, and locks with deep brown ones in front of her. She reaches out to caress the delicate features in front of her.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn...&quot; &quot;Rachel...&quot; was whispered at the same time.<br /><br />Faces move closer, towards each other.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn?&quot; was whispered against her lips.<br /><br />&quot;Yes.&quot; she answered.<br /><br />Then her prayers were answered, the prayers she never really uttered but prayed for with all her heart.<br /><br />A few more minutes passed, hands roamed bodies, mapped skin, traced curves, and lines and bone, lips against lips, hair mussed from being tugged and pulled.<br /><br />Much later she finds herself lying on her side. Her very pregnant belly against Rachel's flat toned stomach and her face nuzzling Rachel's neck. Rachel running one hand against her hair, and the other on her pregnant belly.<br /><br />&quot;Wow.&quot; she utters, gazing at the beauty beside her, with bright smiling brown eyes, damp crazy hair, bruised puffy lips, and a rumpled oxford.<br /><br />&quot;I completely and whole heartedly agree with that sentiment.&quot; was uttered before her lips were assaulted once more.<br /><br />Her prayers were already answered, and then some. It was absolutely fantastic. Maybe her dreams were about to come true too.<br /><br />Minutes or maybe hours later, as exhaustion finally reared its unwanted and unwelcome head (they were well on their way to third base thank you very much)<br /><br />She once again lies on her side, playing with the cuffs of a rumpled oxford shirt, Feeling snug, safe and cherished in Rachel's embrace. She feels a kiss on her nape and smiles at the notion. she grips the hand that was slowly rubbing her baby bump, guiding it to where her daughter was making her presence known via a wave like movement (so much better than a kick or punch to the gut from within). She feels a smile against her nape and another kiss. She thinks that this, right here feels like heaven.<br /><br />They have a lot of things to talk about, a lot of things to discuss, she also had to take into consideration her mother who seemed genuinely concerned about her. And she had a few things to gloat about ( specifically towards her baby daddy and oafish ex boyfriend and whats his face with his coifed hair and penchant for black clothes that threw eggs at her girl. yes her girl. not that Rachel already said yes nor has she asked, but they were well on their way to that point. and besides she was Quinn Fabray right?), but all those things could totally wait, cause Rachel was holding her and nothing else mattered, well maybe after running to the bathroom in awhile then nothing else would totally matter.<br /><br />she was just about to turn around and kiss her girl (she likes the sound of that, but knows that there will be a discussion as to why Rachel shouldn't be addressed or called her girl, being a person and not an object that can be owned yada yada.) she feels a swift kick on her bladder, and a pain on her back and a sudden need to pee, the sixth sense thing was catching.<br /><br />She groans and with the help of her darling, sweetheart (hmm, cute, maybe something else, honey, muffin?) she was able to finally stand up and waddled her way to the bathroom.<br /><br />She finishes her business, flushes the toilet. Washes her hands and giggles at the look of absolute happiness of her reflection.<br /><br />She turns off the lights, and was about to step out of the bathroom when something happens that makes her think she just peed herself, that is until she realizes what really just happened.<br /><br />&quot;RACHEL!MY WATER JUST BROKE!&quot;<br /><br />Then it was absolute chaos.<br /><br /><strong><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""><span style=""font-size: smaller;"">there you go folks, what do you think? i'm taking prompts for the next article of clothing. :)</span></span></strong></lj-cut><br /><br /></span>"

More so than usual. She was at the moment reorganizing her room.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">She was making me dizzy from watching her zoom from one corner of her room to the other, I had made the mistake of trying to make a quick escape, and unfortunately quick for me is never quick enough. I was only a mere foot away from my freedom when she snatched me up and placed me on her bed.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">At least she gave me something to much on.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Lettuce. Yum.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">I happily munch on my greens, occasionally glancing at Rachel who was almost done, based on how she was just looking at her room instead of running round in circles.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">I was quite relieved to see that she was finally winding down. She'd been rearranging for hours.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">When I hear her alarm go off, I knew it was all just wishful thinking.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">I wanted to turn around and glare at it to make it stop making that awful noise. Only Rachel beat me to it, it's probably a good thing. The alarm lives for yet another day.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Apparently the alarm was set a purpose, now I had to endure Rachel's endless questions. About clothes. Specifically which argyle sweater made her eyes <b><i>POP</i></b>.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">This isn't the first time I questioned her sanity. I internally sigh, and was quite amused by the look on her face. I guess she's just as exasperated as I am. She gives me one long look that I return without blinking.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">When she kneels in front of me so that we were eye-level I knew that I had won.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;I'm confusing you aren't I?&quot; she whispers as her fingers gently caress my head.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span></p><span style=""font-size: small;""><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><i>No shit Sherlock, I wonder whose coming over to set you off like this.</i></b></p>  </span><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">She releases a long sigh, so heavy that if I had eyebrows they'd be up to my non-existent hairline.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;I'm not sure if I had mentioned this, but Quinn is coming over today,&quot; she says getting up to lie down beside me, &quot;It's for this Chemistry assignment, Actually I'm still wondering how we got paired up actually, And now I kind of wished I was paired with Santana, she'd make me do the assignment and just add her name, Quinn has changed a lot, but I'm not myself when she's around,&quot; she laments covering her face with her arm.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><i>Ooooh the infamous Quinn Fabray. This should be interesting.</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">I walk closer to her and bite the bottom of her shirt, pulling it to get her attention.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">She lifts her arm, and turns to look at me. Her narrowing eyes made me realize I just made a mistake.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;Tello, I need you to be on your best behavior tonight,&quot; she says.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><i>I'm always on my best behavior. The only time I wasn't was whenever you had those idiots in here with you. And just so we're clear, I'm glaring at you.</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;Don't look at me like that, I don't understand how you, a mild mannered fun loving reptile as yourself could, gnaw at Finn's bag leaving a gaping hole at the bottom,&quot; she says in annoyance.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><i>He deserved it! He kept breaking your heart.</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;Then, you put some of your chewed up food in Noah's jacket pocket when he was here last.&quot;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><i>Serves him right, he was trying to get in your pants.</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;When all he was trying to do was teach me how to play this particular song on the guitar so I could serenade you know who,&quot; she adds getting up from the bed.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span><b><i>In hindsight that might have been a bit harsh, but he still tried to kiss you anyway.</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;And let's not forget Jesse!&quot; her voice was definitely louder, and shriller.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span><b><i>My favorite!</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;You defecated in his shoes! It stank for days!&quot; she exclaims</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span><b><i>He was a douche! Consider it proactive payback, no one eggs you and gets away with it ok!</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;I feel as if you're trying to tell me you dislike all of my former leading men.&quot;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span><b><i>Because not one of them deserve you. And you didn't think of them half as much as you know who.</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;But clearly you had the right idea all along; I was destined for someone else. And she's coming over tonight. So be good.&quot;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span><b><i>Oh Rachel, I'm always good.</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;You know, those three boys always seem to have something happen to them whenever they drop by, usually it's after I tell you they did something that I didn't like. Finn hit his head, Puck's Mohawk got trimmed, and Jessie's eyebrows were singed, quite peculiar events if I do say so myself,&quot; she adds as an afterthought, if I could laugh out loud I would have.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">But I can't.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">I'll just hide inside my shell for now. It's easier to plot my devious plans in the dark anyway.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span><b><i>Hey! Wait a minute put me down this instant!</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">This was one of those things I love to hate, and hate to love: Being carried in Rachel's arms. I'm still waiting for her dad to fix my own little elevator. It's taking ages to get done. I stuck my head long enough for Rachel to notice me looking at her.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;Oh shush you, I just want some strawberries,&quot; she tells me with a glint in her eyes.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span><b><i>Strawberries! I love strawberries!</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;Would you like some Donatello?&quot; she asks me.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span><b><i>Hmmmm Strawberries!</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">She places me on the counter top while she grabs the bowl of fresh, ripe and plump strawberries from the fridge. My mouth instinctively opens in anticipation.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">And just like that one hovers close to my mouth.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">I happily munch on my favorite treat of all time! The Berry's have me on a very strict diet. This is bliss for me.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&quot;Tello...&quot; Rachel sing songs, and I know that sound, she uses it on her Dads all the time.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span><b><i>Warning! Abort! Abort munching on the irresistible strawberries, it's a trap! A trap I say!</i></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Rachel just smiles deviously at me, taunting me with a red plump sweet strawberry.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span><b><i>Drat! She has me.

And the whole&nbsp; <br />experience  made Santana feel blessed that Brittany was with her in every sense of  the word. She may not be&nbsp; <br />shouting about it at the top of her lungs  for all to hear, but she was able to proudly walk around the halls of&nbsp; <br />McKinley  with her hand tangled with Brittany's. Quinn and Rachel didn't have  that, they never had the&nbsp; <br />chance, she felt sad about it, not that  she would ever admit that.<br /><br />&quot;She seems really sad Rach, like  someone kicked her puppy and killed it. She has these circles under her&nbsp;  <br />eyes, and she never smiles anymore, unless she's with Lulu, even  then it's not as bright.&quot; Brittany tells Rachel.&nbsp; <br />&quot;The other day, I  saw her staring at your seat in history, she looked like she was about  to cry. And every time&nbsp; <br />any of us asks her if she's ok. She'd shrug  and continue what she was doing. She refuses to let anyone know&nbsp; <br />what  she feels.&quot;<br /><br />They see Rachel's eyes tear up and watch her cry,  Santana vaguely hears a whispered, 'my poor Quinn'.<br /><br />&quot;I'm sorry  Rach, I didn't mean to upset you.&quot; uttered a panicking Brittany. &quot;It's  just she misses you a lot. We all&nbsp; <br />do.&quot; Rachel just cries harder.<br /><br />Santana  decided to cut in and do some damage control, &quot;B why don't you let me  do the crappy stuff, and&nbsp; <br />you handle the rainbow side of things.&quot;<br /><br />Brittany  just tilts her head to the side and says, &quot;I don't understand S.&quot;<br /><br />Rachel  Berry and Quinn Fabray's drama momentarily forgotten, Santana couldn't  help but smile, &quot;Just make&nbsp; <br />Rachel smile, I'll tell her what's been  happening. ok?&quot; Brittany just nods her head and they both look at the&nbsp; <br />screen  and notices that Rachel was about to answer her ringing phone with an  oddly familiar song.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn?&quot;<br />&quot;Oh, Hi Lulu!&quot;<br />&quot;No, I just  thought your Momma was calling.&quot;<br />&quot;I'm funny?&quot;<br />&quot;Did you mean I  sound funny? It's just cause I had something spicy and my nose is  runny.&quot;<br />&quot;I know sweetie, it is kinda gross.&quot;<br />&quot;So what's up my  little Lulu? did you want a bedtime story?&quot;<br />&quot;Is Momma there?&quot;<br />&quot;Oh,  ok.&quot;<br />&quot;I miss you too, I'll be coming home on your birthday though,  and it&rsquo;s in a few months.&quot;<br /><br />Santana marveled at how Rachel could  carry a normal conversation with a baby that barely spoke in full&nbsp; <br />sentences  and that they seem to understand each other. Only Rachel Berry.<br /><br />&quot;Lulu,  I can't come home now.&quot;<br />&quot;I miss her a lot too baby. H is sad too.&quot;<br />&quot;I  really can't come home yet.&quot;<br />&quot;I love you too Lulu&quot;<br />&quot;And I love  her too very much.&quot;<br />&quot;Lulu, I can't do that right now.&quot;<br />&quot;Oh baby  please don't cry...Lulu...&rdquo;<br />&quot;I-- I can't come home yet.&quot;<br />&quot;Lulu?!  Lulu?!&quot;<br /><br /><br />They watched a frustrated Rachel, look at her phone,  dial a number and frown, &quot;Quinn, You need to talk to&nbsp; <br />Lulu, she  sounded very upset cause I couldn't come home, to you, to both of you.  I, I don't know what to do&nbsp; <br />Quinn. I'm sorry. I-- I miss you.&quot; the  last line whispered reverently. It seemed as if Rachel forget they were&nbsp;  <br />there and called someone else. &quot;Daddy? are you home? could you  check on Lulu? She hang up on me. She was&nbsp; <br />pretty upset and she's  not picking up. Is Quinn there? She is? do you think she'd...Oh ok. I  miss you guys. Can&nbsp; <br />you hug her for me? Thank you Daddy. I love  you.&quot;<br /><br />Santana feels Brittany get up, and looks at her in  question. Brittany gives her a hug and whispers 'I'm gonna&nbsp; <br />check on  Quinn and Lulu' both knowing that Brittany was one of the things that  could make Lulu smile if only&nbsp; <br />for awhile, She turns back to the  screen, and sees Rachel holding the Teddy Bear Lulu had given her.<br /><br />&quot;Rachel,  you know that she's only upset cause she's too young to understand  what's going on right?&quot; She&nbsp; <br />doesn't really understand the  situation.&quot; Santana tries to placate the obviously distressed girl.<br /><br />Rachel  sighs, &quot;It doesn't make it hurt any less, she probably thinks *I* don't  love them, that *I* don't want to&nbsp; <br />come home.&quot;<br /><br />The look of  dejection and sadness on Rachel's face made Santana want to be able to  hug the girl, 'wow, I&rsquo;ve&nbsp; <br />like totally come a long way' she thought  ruefully. &quot;Rachel don't be like that, you should think about the&nbsp; <br />opportunity  you've been given. Just worry about getting your whole body through the  door and not just&nbsp; <br />your foot, not that it's going to be difficult  since your teeny.&quot; She smiles at the small smile she gets in return,&nbsp; <br />&quot;I  promise B and I will take care of Quinn and Lulu, just do what it is  that you left Lima for.&quot;<br /><br />She watches as Rachel sits up a bit  straighter and looks at her with intense brown eyes, &quot;You do know that&nbsp; <br />one  of the reasons why I left the way I did was because Quinn didn't want  us to be together, spouting&nbsp; <br />nonsense about being selfish and  unworthy. How she got that notion in her head is beyond me.&quot; She sees&nbsp; <br />Rachel  grab something beside her monitor, it was a picture frame, which Rachel  turned towards the camera.&nbsp; <br />The picture inside was that of Quinn  holding Rachel who had her back against the arm of the sofa with a&nbsp; <br />sleeping  Lulu against her. Quinn was smiling a content smile, look down at her  daughter held by the girl she&nbsp; <br />was holding, and Rachel had her head  turned looking at Quinn love shining in her eyes. It took Santana's&nbsp; <br />breath  away. Turning the picture back to her, Rachel runs her fingers on  Quinn's face, &quot;Dad took this picture&nbsp; <br />and gave it to me the night I  was leaving, I don't even know how he was able to do that. I remember  this day,&nbsp; <br />It was a Saturday and Lulu was strutting around the house  in a tutu all day, and Quinn kept calling her little&nbsp; <br />Lulu in a  tutu. She was so happy, and so content. She helped Dad and Daddy make  dinner and I couldn't stop&nbsp; <br />myself from thinking that we could be  just like that with Lulu someday. As we watched a movie, she held me&nbsp; <br />in  her embrace, as Lulu was snuggled against my chest fast asleep, Quinn  occasionally ran her hands through&nbsp; <br />my hair, across my arms, she  gently rubbed Lulu's head. And when she thought I was asleep, she'd  gently&nbsp; <br />sporadically kissed my head, my cheek, my shoulder. When we  retired to bed, we changed positions. I held&nbsp; <br />her in my arms, and  once she was asleep I knew without a doubt that I was so madly in love  with her. That&nbsp; <br />day is engraved in my memory; I keep it with me  always. It was on that day that I knew I wanted to spend the&nbsp; <br />rest  of my life with Quinn, and raise Lulu with her. It was only a matter of  time before we reached the&nbsp; <br />pivotal point wherein we'd have to  finally acknowledge our feelings, I had planned for it. The day I was  going&nbsp; <br />to confess was also the day I got that call.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Rach--&quot;  Santana tries to speak, but finds herself unable to, it seemed that  Life had a fucked up common&nbsp; <br />sense.<br /><br />&quot;It's not that I don't  understand why she was wary of starting that kind of relationship with  me. I was&nbsp; <br />completely and absolutely prepared to woo her, and show  her that just because we were about to embark&nbsp; <br />on a romantic  relationship it did not mean we had to abandon the friendship we had  cultivated. I just, I&nbsp; <br />wanted more time, I was asking her to let us  have more time with each other, to explore whatever this thing&nbsp; <br />between  us was. We already had to think about being apart because we were on  our last year of high school&nbsp; <br />and by taking this opportunity, it  meant cutting an already short time together shorter. I wanted to stay  and&nbsp; <br />she wanted me to go. In her mind she believed that she was  unworthy of my love, that letting me go and&nbsp; <br />fulfill my dreams was  the best path for me to take. She didn't know that since falling  irrevocably in love with&nbsp; <br />her, my dreams changed, I still want to  conquer New York and Broadway, with her and Lulu, and whoever&nbsp; <br />comes  next.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Wow Berry. I mean just Wow.&quot; was all Santana could say.<br /><br />&quot;I  love her Santana, I really really love her. And if it means, sticking  out my neck here in lonely New York,&nbsp; <br />working towards Julliard and  Broadway then I will. I will do absolutely everything and anything to  make it. But&nbsp; <br />I need her too, I need her too.&quot; Rachel starts crying  again, &quot;I need to know that she'll be there, that she&nbsp; <br />loves me,  that we'll be together one day, that she's mine just like I'm hers. Coz  if it isn't the case then&nbsp; <br />whatever I'm doing here will be moot,  whatever success I gain is worth nothing.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Rachel, she just  thinks she's doing what's best for you. This is really killing her too.&quot;  Santana says trying to&nbsp; <br />defend Quinn Fabray's fucked up sense of  logic and sacrifice.<br /><br />&quot;Case in point, we don't have to be  miserable at all. If it were up to me, we'd try, even if I was here and  she&nbsp; <br />was there we could have made it work. But she took away that  chance, she never gave me a choice. And&nbsp; <br />even if I don't agree with  how she just decided for the both of us, it is imperative that she be  the one to&nbsp; <br />end this impasse she banished us to. So really, I have  no choice in the matter, I love her, she loves me, She&nbsp; <br />wants me to  fulfill my dreams, and for me being with her is part of those dreams,  and unless she finally&nbsp; <br />realizes that I need her just as much as she  needs me, we're bound to stay as miserable as we are now.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You're  giving her way too much power in your relationship Rachel.&quot; Santana  warns the girl, It's not that she's&nbsp; <br />worried Quinn would take  advantage of that power, It's obvious she doesn't even know that she  wields that&nbsp; <br />power over Rachel, she just doesn't want them hurting  any more than they already were, after all they were&nbsp; <br />all friends  now.<br /><br />Rachel just smiles at her, &quot;Contrary to popular belief, the  Bottom/Submissive always has the upper hand&nbsp; <br />Santana, When they say  stop the Top/Dominant stops. In most cases anyway, isn't your  relationship with&nbsp; <br />Brittany working along the same lines. You are  obviously the dominant one in the relationship, harder,&nbsp; <br />fiercer,  stronger. But at the end of the day, you cave to whatever Brittany  says.&quot;<br /><br />Santana just turns red at that, &quot;Ok first off, I love  Brittany and I just want her happy, and two, we are not in&nbsp; <br />any way  or form in any kind of BDSM thing going. We have a certain kind of  balance between us, a symbiotic&nbsp; <br />coupling. She's the yang to my yin  you know.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I do, and I hope one day Quinn will understand that  she could never ever take advantage of me.&nbsp; What I&nbsp; <br />offer, what I  feel, and what I do, I do so freely without asking anything in return.&quot;  Santana nods, and tells&nbsp; <br />herself that she was going to knock some  sense into Quinn Fabray, maybe even hit her as long as 1.) Lulu&nbsp; <br />wasn't  anywhere near the vicinity, 2.) Rachel's dads don't see it, and if they  do she tells them why she did it,&nbsp; <br />and 3.) Rachel never finds out.<br /><br />&quot;Just  hang in there Berry, maybe B and I will knock some sense into her,  knowing Quinn it might take awhile,&nbsp; <br />with her having such a hard  head and all.&quot; they share a laugh, but Santana wasn't done, &quot;She does  love you&nbsp; <br />Rachel, I know that is, cause I see the way she looks at  you, and it's the same way B looks at me. Just give&nbsp; <br />her time ok?&quot;<br /><br />Rachel  just nods her head and waves goodbye, Santana shuts down the computer  and waits for Brittany to&nbsp; <br />call or come over. She must have fallen  asleep, and was awoken by Brittany getting in bed beside her. &quot;Go&nbsp; <br />back  to sleep baby, I'll be here in the morning.&quot; She faintly feels against  her nape.<br /><br />Santana nods and mumbles a garbled 'love you', and  smiles when Brittany whispers 'I love you too'.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Brittany  was supposed to be with them, but her mom called and asked her to come  home, so Santana was&nbsp; <br />stuck with Quinn in the middle of the park,  watching the other girl look at her phone for the past 15&nbsp; <br />minutes,  she counted 40 sighs since they sat down. On the 41st sigh her hand  shoots out and grabs said&nbsp; <br />phone, and Quinn's hand shoots out to  grabs her arm.<br /><br />&quot;Hey! Give it back Lopez!&quot; Quinn mutters angrily<br /><br />Santana  just sneers, &quot;What are you gonna do Fabray, send me away too?&quot;<br /><br />She  sees Quinn deflate in front of her and let go of her arm, and almost  wanted to kick herself, almost being&nbsp; <br />the operative word.<br /><br />&quot;Can  I please have my phone back S.&quot; Quinn mumbled.<br /><br />&quot;As soon as I  find out what you keep looking at.&quot; was Santana's answer, she looks down  on the screen in front&nbsp; <br />of her and was not surprised to see it was  Rachel and Lulu, it was a picture she hadn't seen before. Rachel&nbsp; <br />was  sleeping on her side an arm across a sleeping Lulu who shared the exact  same pose holding a teddy bear,&nbsp; <br />she had never seen Rachel so  relaxed before, and for a second time a picture took her breath away.  'damn,&nbsp; <br />this love thing is really kicking my ass, I&rsquo;ve turned into a  giant mush ball.' she silently hands the phone back to&nbsp; <br />Quinn, and  just shrugs.<br /><br />Holding her phone, Quinn just stares at the picture  on her screen, &quot;I love this picture of them, they look like&nbsp; <br />two  peas in a pod, they sleep the exact same way.&quot; A small sad smile takes  residence on Quinn's lips, &quot;I used&nbsp; <br />to watch them sleep curled  around each other, and feel my heart swell. Rachel is so loving towards  Lulu, like&nbsp; <br />she was her own. And Lulu absolutely adores Rachel, she  thinks Rachel hung the moon.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Just like you do?&quot; Santana  interjects.<br /><br />&quot;Not just the moon, but the stars too.&quot; was Quinn's  whispered reply, &quot;I--&quot; Quinn falters, and wipes and errant&nbsp; <br />tear  away, &quot;I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I miss her so much, I love  her so much, but I can't bring&nbsp; <br />myself to talk to her aside from  saying goodnight.&quot; Quinn's tears start flowing now, &quot;I feel like such a  bad&nbsp; <br />person, last night Lulu was so upset coz she wanted Rachel to  come home coz I missed her, and when Rachel&nbsp; <br />told her she couldn't,  she got mad at her, *Mad* at her H coz she wouldn't come home and make  her Momma&nbsp; <br />happy.&quot;<br /><br />When Quinn starts sobbing Santana stands  up and sits beside the other girl, pulling her into an embrace.<br /><br />&quot;I've  made such a big mess out of things S, I keep thinking about Rachel,  everywhere I look, everything I do&nbsp; <br />reminds me that I told Rachel to  leave me, leave us. I never told her I love her and sent her away. In  my mind&nbsp; <br />I know I did the right thing, I want her to be happy S, and  making her stay here in Lima would only make her&nbsp; <br />miserable. She  deserved the world, and if it meant me sacrificing my happiness then so  be it. I just didn't think&nbsp; <br />it would hurt this much. I just,  sometimes I think this is some kind of karmic retribution going on for  every&nbsp; <br />wrong thing I've done you know? I mean just when I finally  realize that I was in love with Rachel, just when I&nbsp; <br />realize that I  was loved and that I started feeling safe again, that I felt like I  belonged, I had someone who&nbsp; <br />forgave me for my transgressions and  shortcomings, who accepted me even if I didn't deserve it, not even in&nbsp; <br />a  million years but she did...&quot; she takes a deep breath, &quot;then-- then I  had to choose between loving her, and&nbsp; <br />*loving* her.&quot;<br /><br />Santana  was at her wits end, and steeled herself to knock some sense into her  friend, &quot;Q, do you really hate&nbsp; <br />yourself so much that you don't want  to be happy? You really didn't have to choose at all you know?&quot;<br /><br />Quinn  turned to her gaping, unable to make any sound.<br /><br />&quot;No seriously,&quot;  Santana prodded, &quot;It's like all you ever think is woe me, my life sucks,  I made mistakes but&nbsp; <br />Rachel deserves to be happy, She deserves New  York. She deserves better than me. Seriously?!&quot; She shouts&nbsp; <br />the last  word so loud that almost everyone around them turned and looked. Quinn  just kept looking at her.&nbsp; <br />&quot;Look Quinn, I love you, you're my  bestest friend aside from B, but this, this morbid need to punish  yourself is&nbsp; <br />absurd. She loves you Q, she loves you with all her  heart. She loves your daughter, her whole family loves&nbsp; <br />both of you,  hell you're fucking part of the family. Even before Rachel left, you  both had changed we all&nbsp; <br />knew and saw it, and while she was wearing  her heart on her argyle, you kept yours hidden under a&nbsp; <br />cardigan.&quot;  Santana takes a deep breath waiting for Quinn to interrupt, and when she  doesn't she continues,&nbsp; <br />&quot;Look, I get it you're afraid. After  everything that happened the Berry Daddies became your pillars, and&nbsp; <br />Rachel  your North Star, your guiding light. They became your family even if  you just really realized it&nbsp; <br />recently, I get that you think that  this whole thing might be taken away from you, but you need to&nbsp; <br />understand  you're doing a fine job of letting it slip away all on your own, and  I'm not talking about the Berry&nbsp; <br />Daddies, I'm talking about Rachel  and how you told her you could only be just friends even it was so  blatantly&nbsp; <br />obvious both of you wanted more, you were both so head  over heels puppy dog in love with each other.&quot;<br /><br />Quinn sniffles,  &quot;If I had told her that I love her, If I said that we should be  together, and it didn't work, I don't&nbsp; <br />know how I would have coped.&quot;  Wiping at her tears, &quot;If I had asked her to stay she might never have  left, and&nbsp; <br />I couldn't do that to her, not after everything she's  done for me.&quot;<br /><br />Santana just rolled her eyes and flicked Quinn's  head, she hears and indignant 'Hey' and just ignores it,&nbsp; <br />&quot;Sometimes  I wonder why is it that for someone so smart, you are just absolutely  dumb when it comes to&nbsp; <br />things like this.&quot; Quinn glares at her and  she glares back. &quot;Really Quinn, whatever happened to the fearless&nbsp; <br />queen  that I knew?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;She got drunk and slept with her then boyfriends  bestfriend, got pregnant and got dethroned.&quot; was Quinn's&nbsp; <br />reply.<br /><br />A  sigh escaped the latina, &quot;So that's it, you're just giving her up? you  won't even let her try, you won't even&nbsp; <br />fight for her? you won't  even take that chance huh?&quot; when the blonde doesn't answer, &quot;You are so  pathetic&nbsp; <br />it's depressing.&quot; she stands up, &quot;You're right. You don't  deserve Rachel. You're just another Lima Loser and&nbsp; <br />she's absolutely  better of without you and I hope she finds someone who will love her  more than you ever&nbsp; <br />could.&quot;<br /><br />Before she knew it Santana's  cheek stung, and in front of her was an angry looking Quinn Fabray, the  same&nbsp; <br />Quinn Fabray that used to walk down the halls of McKinley in a  cheerio's uniform. Santana lifts up a hand to&nbsp; <br />rub her cheek, 'that  hurt' she thinks, She watches Quinn watch her, and then look at her  hand that had&nbsp; <br />slapped Santana. She once again deflates to the shell  she became after Rachel left.<br /><br />Quinn's lips quiver, then her  whole body shudders as she cries. &quot;Oh god, Santana I'm sorry!&quot; she  exclaims&nbsp; <br />before dropping to her knees.<br /><br />Santana just follows  suit and gathers the crying girl in her arms, &quot;At least that got a  reaction out of you.&quot; she&nbsp; <br />lamely jokes, helping Quinn back up on  the bench where they were sitting. &quot;Quinn, I can't tell you what to&nbsp; <br />do  ok? all I know is that every time We talk to Rachel, all she talks  about is you. Last night was the first time I&nbsp; <br />saw Rachel cry that  hard, it was also the first time I heard her basically say that she  wants a life with you,&nbsp; <br />not just a relationship, she vaguely  mentioned babies Quinn, BABIES!! and not just Lulu! And all she wants is  a&nbsp; <br />chance ok? She knows you think that Broadway is her dream.&quot; She  lifts her friends face up so they were face&nbsp; <br />to face and looking at  each other. &quot;What you don't know is that all of those dreams will mean  absolutely&nbsp; <br />nothing without you.&quot; Wiping Quinn's tears away, &quot; She  loves you Quinn, just like you love her. So you better&nbsp; <br />get your act  together. You may not believe it, but Rachel Berry loves you with all  that she is and wants&nbsp; <br />nothing else but a chance to show you. And  I'm pretty sure she loves for keeps. So&nbsp; even if you think you&nbsp; <br />don't  deserve it, everyone else knows you do. Stop running away from her  Quinn, stop pushing her away. You&nbsp; <br />deserve to be happy Quinn, just  like the rest of us.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I just don't want to lose her, what if it  doesn't work out? I don't think I can take that, I don't think my heart&nbsp;  <br />will ever recover from that kind of blow. What if love isn't  enough?&quot; Quinn asks.<br /><br />&quot;Look if you guys were able to live together  without killing each other while you despised each other, I'm&nbsp; <br />pretty  sure you can overcome everything else. You won't lose her if you work  on it, what you're doing now is&nbsp; <br />definitely doing that job for you.  Nothing is perfect Quinn, you're going to have to work on it, and you&nbsp; <br />pretty  much have to make it up to her.&quot; was Santana's answer.<br /><br />&quot;I never  really hated her you know.&quot; Quinn mutters somewhat off topic.<br /><br />Santana  just laughs, &quot;Oh I knew that Fabray, B and I used to talk about it all  the time, even when we were&nbsp; <br />just kids, my first clue was how you  couldn't not pick on Rachel, it was kinda kindergardenish even when we&nbsp; <br />started  high school.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Quinn asks with furrowed  brows.<br /><br />Santana laughs harder, &quot;You know when a little boy likes a  little girl, he punches her, pulls her hair, tells her&nbsp; <br />she has  cooties all coz he likes her.&quot;<br /><br />Quinn stares at her blankly and  then mutter an &quot;Oh.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Look, I won't hit you for hitting me.&quot;  Santana starts and almost laughs when Quinn shirks away, &quot;B, Rachel&nbsp; <br />and  the Berry Daddies will prolly have my hide, and I don't want Lulu to  glare at me every time I see her, I&nbsp; <br />kinda like being the squirts  bad-ass Santy&quot; she grabs Quinn's hand and holds it, &quot;We all just want  both of you&nbsp; <br />to be happy, stop playing stupid and open your eyes.&quot;<br /><br />They  hear a bubbly voice from a distance, &quot;You guys!&quot; and both watch as  Brittany skips towards them.<br /><br />&quot;The moment you get your head outta  your ass, is the moment you get to have what B and I have. Take that&nbsp; <br />leap  and go get your girl, ok Fabray?&quot; was the last thing Santana says  before she stands to welcome her girl&nbsp; <br />with open arms.<br /><br />Brittany  just squeals in delight as Santana lifts her off of her feet, and once  back on the ground, she walks&nbsp; <br />dragging a smiling Santana over to  Quinn, who she proceeds to hug. &quot;What did I miss?&quot; she asks.<br /><br />Santana  just raises her eyebrows at Quinn waiting for her to say something. &quot;S  just made me realize some&nbsp; <br />things B.&quot;<br /><br />Brittany looks at her  girlfriend and smiles, &quot;Yeah?&quot; she asks, not waiting for a reply she  gives Santana a kiss.&nbsp; <br />&quot;Well, I hope you stop being stupid and stop  making Rachel so miserable. It's sad, she's sad, I've never seen&nbsp; <br />her  this Un-Rachel like and I don't like it, it makes me really feel bad,  and she's too far away that I can't give&nbsp; <br />her a hug. Make her stop  hurting ok? coz if you don't I might just start hating you or maybe sick  my Santana&nbsp; <br />on you.&quot;<br /><br />Quinn was surprised at this, Santana  could so kick her ass without even trying, &quot;I---, I'll try B.&quot;<br /><br />With  narrowed eyes, Brittany stares at Quinn for quite some time. Quinn was  starting to worry, but was able&nbsp; <br />to release the breath she was  holding when the other girl gives her a bright smile and says, &quot;OK.&quot;<br /><br />All  of a sudden the rain comes pouring in, and all three girls make a mad  dash for some for Santana's car.&nbsp; <br />They were all soaked but Quinn  didn't seem to notice, so lost in her thoughts, she didn't notice  Santana&nbsp; <br />stopping in front of her house.<br /><br />&quot;Hey Quinn, this is  your stop.&quot; mutters Santana.<br /><br />Quinn turns her head and sees a  mirage of Rachel waving at her with an umbrella, her heart clenches and&nbsp;  <br />she wishes it were true. &quot;Yeah, ok. Thanks guys.&quot; She unbuckles her  seatbelt and was about to open the&nbsp; <br />door when she hears Brittany  say her name.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn.&quot; she begins, &quot;I know that I'm not so smart,  but I just want you to know that Rachel is the best thing&nbsp; <br />that  ever happened in your life aside from Lulu. And letting that go, not  doing anything about it is going to&nbsp; <br />be the stupidest thing ever or  whatever you know.&quot;<br /><br />Not knowing how to react, Quinn just nods her  head not really paying attention as Santana tells her&nbsp; <br />goodbye, She  just gets out of the car. Instead of coming in, she starts walking with  no clear destination in&nbsp; <br />her mind, she finds herself in front of  her old parish. She enters, and walks to one pew, gets down on her&nbsp; <br />knees  and prays, asking for guidance, asking for forgiveness, for help. She  cries silent tears and so lost in her&nbsp; <br />despair she never notices the  parish priest approach her. Once he sits down beside her and asks her  what&nbsp; <br />was wrong, she was apprehensive to say anything, she really  didn't think telling a priest that she was in love&nbsp; <br />with a girl was  the best course of action. But she was surprised when he didn't even bat  an eyelash, he just&nbsp; <br />told her that God doesn't give us troubles we  can't overcome, and that she was a true testament to that,&nbsp; <br />and if  she really did love this girl with that breathless smile and a voice as  beautiful as a sunrise, then she&nbsp; <br />should go for it. He also said  that sometimes we meet people that changes our lives in the most  extraordinary&nbsp; <br />way, that there are people that make us happy beyond  the meaning of the word happy and all you really&nbsp; <br />need to do is hold  on. She thanks him, and as she was leaving he gives her a hug even if  she was wet with&nbsp; <br />rain and tells her that she can come back anytime  with her little girl in tow and that if the way her eyes light&nbsp; <br />up  at the mere mention of her Rachel's name was any indication, she should  play for keeps. All Quinn could&nbsp; <br />do was blush mumble a thank you.<br /><br />The  rain was slowing down, and she makes her way back home. Once inside she  hastily makes her way to&nbsp; <br />their room, to the bathroom strips and  takes a shower. Once done and fully clothed she lies in bed, and&nbsp; <br />thinks  of Rachel.<br /><br />She grabs and holds Rachel's pillow closer to her  body, and takes a deep lungful of air. It still smells like her.&nbsp; <br />And  for a moment it doesn't hurt as much.<br /><br />She still doesn't know  what to do. All she knows is that she loves Rachel and she misses her.  She never&nbsp; <br />thought that Rachel would be miserable without her in New  York. And finally realizing she might have been&nbsp; <br />wrong about some  things made her feel like a world class bitch. The conversation she had  with the priest&nbsp; <br />also made her feel lighter somehow.<br /><br />Unable  to stop herself from thinking of Rachel, and of all those moments when  her heart swelled with so&nbsp; <br />much love for the other girl she thought  it would burst. She abruptly gets out of bed, and goes to the living&nbsp; <br />room,  rummaging around for a bit, she finds what she was looking for, a home  made movie that was a few&nbsp; <br />months old, she can't remember why she  was filming that day, but she was very thankful that she had this&nbsp; <br />moment  on film.<br /><br />She pops it in, and watches as the camera was trained  on Rachel and Lulu sitting face to face. Rachel was&nbsp; <br />teaching Lulu  the hand gestures for 'twinkle twinkle, little star' and Lulu had such a  cute concentrated look&nbsp; <br />on her face that Quinn couldn't help but  smile. She could hear Rachel softly sing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twinkle, twinkle,  little star,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How I wonder what you are!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up above the world  so high,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a diamond in the sky!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twinkle, twinkle,  little star,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How I wonder what you are.<br /><br />She knew there  were other parts of the song, but Rachel seemed to just stick to one  stanza, leave it to her&nbsp; <br />to focus on the stars part. Rachel was  opening and closing her hands, and Lulu was trying her best to mimic&nbsp; <br />it.  She watched a smile blossom on Rachel's face as Lulu beamed at her when  she was able to do it just like&nbsp; <br />Rachel did.<br /><br />The video gets a  bit shaky and changed angles then a few seconds later the video version  of Quinn shows up&nbsp; <br />and sits herself in between her daughter and  Rachel. Lulu looks at her beaming and exclaims, &quot;Momma look.&quot;&nbsp; <br />she  closes and opens her hands then frowns since Rachel wasn't singing  along. &quot;H gen!&quot; she demands. Both&nbsp; <br />teenagers just look at Lulu with  wide eyes, Lulu looked perplexed and tried again, &quot;H gen peas.&quot; she  says.<br /><br />Quinn looks at Rachel then, who looks as if she's about to  cry while smiling the biggest grin she's ever seen&nbsp; <br />on the Diva's  face. She turns to her daughter and asks, &quot;What did you say baby?&quot; She  sees her daughter pout.<br /><br />&quot;H gen peas.&quot; she says as enunciating  each word as if it was giving a speech.<br /><br />&quot;H?&quot; questions Quinn,  Lulu just nods her head and looks at Rachel. &quot;Do you mean Rach?&quot; she  asks again. Lulu&nbsp; <br />nods one more time. And once again says. &quot;H gen  peas!&quot; louder this time as if Rachel didn't hear her the first&nbsp; <br />time.<br /><br />She  swoops her daughter in a hug, unable to stop herself, she glances to  her right and sees Rachel openly&nbsp; <br />crying and smiling. Lulu squirms  away from her arms when she hears sniffling. And once Lulu's eyes land  on&nbsp; <br />Rachel, she unsteadily gets on her feet and toddingly walks over  to Rachel, who immediately holds onto the&nbsp; <br />baby's waist. &quot;H sad?&quot;  she asks.<br /><br />Rachel just shakes her head, rubs her face on her  shoulder and smiles. &quot;I'm ok baby, want me to sing again&nbsp; <br />then you  can show Momma how to do twinkle twinkle?&quot; Lulu gives Rachel a sloppy  kiss then nods her head&nbsp; <br />enthusiastically and plops down on her lap.  Rachel just laughs and asks, &quot;Don't you want Momma to see what&nbsp; <br />your  doing baby?&quot;<br /><br />Lulu turns her head around and looks at Quinn,  &quot;Ohhh.&quot;, and she shakingly stands up and turns with the help&nbsp; <br />of  Rachel. As Rachel starts singing Lulu beams at her Momma while doing the  actions to the song. They do&nbsp; <br />the song a couple of times until Lulu  lost interest and started playing with her toys.<br /><br />Quinn pressed  pause and looks at video Rachel who was watching Lulu, she remembers  this day so vividly in&nbsp; <br />her mind. She knows how her heart skipped a  beat the moment Rachel finally turns around and&nbsp; throws her&nbsp; <br />arms  around Quinn. It was the first time Lulu said her nick name, granted it  was an even shorter version.&nbsp; <br />Quinn remembers the love she saw on  Rache's eyes as she kept on looking at Lulu, and she remembers how&nbsp; <br />those  eyes would light up every time Lulu called on her &quot;H&quot;. She remembers  the proud look on Rachel's face&nbsp; <br />when Lulu wobbled to where she sat  and made her sing twinkle, twinkle so that the little girl could show&nbsp; <br />Rachel's  dad what she could do. Once Lulu started calling Rachel &quot;H&quot;, it was a  race to what Lulu would say&nbsp; <br />first, if it was &quot;Grandpa&quot; or &quot;Zayde&quot;,  Bit (which was actually Brittany) won.<br /><br />That was the night that  finally made her realize she was absolutely in love with Rachel. And  staring at the&nbsp; <br />frozen screen before her, she knew exactly what she  had to do, she was going to get her girl, she was taking&nbsp; <br />that leap  of faith. She never noticed the digital clock on the radio change from  06:29 to 06:30.<br /><br />She's startled from her thoughts by the ringing  phone and hurriedly stands to answer it.<br /><br />&quot;Rachel---&quot; Quinn  starts, she knows her voice was quivering, she knows that she is now  openly crying but she&nbsp; <br />didn't care. She hears a sharp intake of  breath, and also hears its slow release, time slowed down, It seemed&nbsp; <br />like  minutes or maybe even hours had gone by.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn?&quot; asks Rachel as  if she thought she imagining things.<br /><br />&quot;I mi--, I miss you so much  Rachel.&quot; mumbles Quinn, trying to stop her tears. &quot;So so much.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I--,  I miss you too.&quot; was Rachel's shaky reply.<br /><br />Quinn's heart ached,  and her voice gets caught in her throat. She missed her so much. She  couldn't speak.<br /><br />Rachel's panicked voice comes through the line  clear and crisp, &quot;Quinn are you still there?&quot;<br /><br />Quinn finds her  voice, her courage and her conviction. She loved Rachel Berry, and  starting this moment, it&nbsp; <br />was enough. &quot;I love you Rachel, I'm so in  love with you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And I am so ridiculously in love with you.&quot; was  Rachel's whispered reply.<br /><br />&quot;Can we try Rach? Is it too late?&quot;  Quinn asks almost afraid of the answer.<br /><br />She hears Rachel laugh  through her tears, &quot;I believe it's just about time. I love you Quinn  Fabray even if it&nbsp; <br />took you long enough to get on board with me on  this.&quot;<br /><br />She clutches the phone to her, and laughs a real laugh in a  very long time. &quot;I know, Santana told me I was&nbsp; <br />kinda dumb for  someone so smart.&quot;, her heart was lighter, her world brighter. She loved  Rachel and Rachel&nbsp; <br />loved her, they loved each other. Finally, she  lets herself really believe it.<br /><br />Rachel makes and uh-hm sound, &quot;I  whole heartedly agree, I am pleased that Santana was able to talk some&nbsp; <br />sense  into you. I still don't understand how you got all of those silly  notions in your head.&quot; Rachel pauses&nbsp; <br />then in a gentle voice says,  &quot;You're it for me Quinn Fabray. I want you to know that I am never  letting you&nbsp; <br />run away from me ever again.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Why would I run?  You're it for me too.&quot; She whispers believing it was true. What they had  was real, and&nbsp; <br />nothing was going to stand in their way.<br /><br />&quot;Good.&quot;  states Rachel.<br /><br />They lapse into a comfortable silence, only their  breathing could be heard over the phone. Both knew that&nbsp; <br />they were  in for a bumpy road, but they had each other, and &quot;their&quot; Dads, they had  Lulu and they had their&nbsp; <br />friends.<br /><br />Quinn sighs happily, &quot;I  love you Rachel.&quot; she says.<br /><br />&quot;And I you my love.&quot; was Rachel's  reply.<br /><br />Both of them knew that it may only be the beginning and  with their shared history it was bound to be a&nbsp; <br />bumpy ride. They  still had a lot of things to talk about and and a lot of things to think  about, but they loved&nbsp; <br />each other and they were finally 'together',  those were the most important parts.<br /><br />The End for now<br /></span></lj-cut><span style=""font-size: small;""></span>"

She didn't think it was possible to feel guiltier than she already did, she was wrong. She closes the front door behind her and everything hits her all at the same time. Rachel was gone, she told the Berry's she was leaving, she and her daughter would be homeless, she made the one person that never let her down go, she let the people who took her in watch their only daughter leave and it was all her fault.<br /><br />She loses the battle against stopping the sob from escaping her fragile body, it was followed by tears running down her face. She tightens her grip on her girl, Lulu was the only thing she had now. She never saw David make his way to where she stood unmoving. &quot;Let me get Lulu to bed, and we can all talk ok?&quot; He never waits for her reply and instead gently takes the sleeping girl from her arms and walks towards the sleeping mat in the corner of the living room.<br /><br />'Oh God, I made her leave, what have I done?!' she thought.<br /><br />&quot;No you didn't, you just helped her make that choice.&quot; she turns around and watches David hurry to her side, she had said it out loud.<br /><br />The broken heart that Rachel and her dads helped put back together, started breaking all over again. And as David pulls her into a warm fatherly embrace, she knew that putting her heart back together would take time. She had disappointed them, she did this. Just when she thought she was on the right track, and worthy of calling the Berry's house home, she tells Rachel to leave and she bears witness to the aftermath.<br /><br />&quot;Oh sweetie it's not your fault,&quot; David rubs circles on her back, In Quinn's mind she thought she didn't deserve the comfort he offered. She had told his daughter that she couldn't love her back, that she couldn't love her that way, and that made her leave. &quot;Aaron, a little help here?&quot; He directs at his husband, all the while leading a broken Quinn Fabray to the couch. Once seated, David pulls away only to have Quinn's arms wrap tighter around him, &quot;I'm not letting go ok, it's ok, I'm not letting you go.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I'm so sorry, so so sorry. She probably think I don't love her, I made her leave. I did this. I don't deserve to be here.&quot; she whispers against his damp shirt, damp because of all the tears she shed.<br /><br />David pulls away a bit forcefully this time, and tilts Quinn's chin up so their eyes met. &quot;Quinn, regardless of what you girls talked about. Rachel was bound to leave Lima one way or another. Her departure just got bumped up a few months. In a way I can understand why you did what you did, and it's because you love her right? . I tried telling her that, she just doesn't understand why you think she doesn't deserve you.&quot; She tries to speak, but the only sound she could make were whimpers, &quot;I know you love my daughter, and that she loves you, You just need to find out what you want ok? you need to believe in that love ok?.&quot; She feels another pair of arms encircle both of them.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn, I know that telling Rachel to go was hard for you&quot;, stated Aaron, she didn't have to look at them to know that the Berry's were looking at each other. &quot;Since you started living with us, I saw how your relationship with Rachel evolved from barely speaking to a loving co-existence. David and I made bets on when you girls would fall in love, not that you were subtle about the longing looks and gentle touches anyway.&quot;<br /><br />The arms around her fall away leaving her feeling so empty and alone. Until Aaron makes her look at him as he spoke.<br /><br />&quot;We watched both of you dote on Lulu, and take care of her the same way David and I did with Rachel, and I was so happy. I knew my little girl was going to be a great mother. Seeing it happen right in front of me blew me away. In my mind I imagined you calling me Dad too.&quot; She starts crying again, and Aaron gently wipes her tears away, he was always so different from Rachel and David who was so open and loving except with Lulu, this was a new side to him she never saw before it made her feel so loved and accepted, she felt so unworthy.<br /><br />'I don't deserve this? I don't deserve these wonderful people in my life?' she thinks to herself, knowing she was about to lose them.<br /><br />&quot;Now about being out of our hair.&quot; Aaron repeating the words she spoke in the car, made the pieces of her broken heart plummeth into a bottomless abyss, &quot;I just watched our daughter get on a plane and leave for New York.&quot; She looks away from him and keeps her eyes trained on Lulu's toys strewn across the living room wondering how and where she was going to put all of it, &quot;If you think that I'll let *our other* daughter leave with *our* granddaughter, *you* are definitely mistaken.&quot;<br /><br />She turns her head so fast, she almost had whiplash, &quot;Daugh--&quot; she tries to ask, but can't bring herself to finish the question.<br /><br />&quot;Oh sweetie, we already consider you our daughter, and Lulu our grandbaby. Regardless of what happened, or what you both decide it does not change the fact that we love you both, equally. And because we love you, we refuse to let you leave. You and Lulu are staying right here, well until we need to decide on college of course.&quot; Aaron says with a smile.<br /><br />Unable to stop herslef she flung herself at Aaron and held on for dear life mumbling, &quot;Thank you, thank you.&quot; over and over again. It takes her a few minutes to calm down. Quinn is amazed at how she feels so safe and loved in either Aaron or David's arms safer than being held in her father and mother's embrace. She thinks it's because the Berry's just wanted her to be her and not some factory manufactured daughter that conformed to their every whim, Rachel was a perfect example of that.<br /><br />They stayed that way for awhile, and David joked he was feeling left out, that the hug they shared turned into a Quinn Fabray sandwich with her in between. She wasn't sure how long the hug-fest was going on, so lost in the feeling of family that enveloped her that she almost didn't see how adorable her little girl looked rubbing sleep off her eyes sitting on her sleeping mat on the floor.<br /><br />Aaron pulls away, stands and walks over to Lulu exclaiming, &quot;It's my favorite little princess!&quot; once Lulu sees him smiles she raises her hands up saying, &quot;Up!&quot; Aaron just laughs kneels infront of her and proceeds to tickle her, she and David share a knowing smile as Lulu feebly bats at Aaron's hand that was laughing heartily as she did so.<br /><br />&quot;Gamps silly.&quot; says Lulu, looking at Aaron as she holds a finger each in her hands, trying to make him stop.<br /><br />&quot;Well yes, there is that. But only for my favorite pretty little princess.&quot; he mock whispers to the little girl beaming at him.<br /><br />&quot;Yay!&quot; Lulu exclaims, &quot;Gamps up peas.&quot; she asks.<br /><br />Aaron stands up and lifts Lulu up, &quot;Let's go over to Zayde and Momma!&quot; he tells her, and Lulu just nods her head with a smile.<br /><br />They reach the sofa, and Aaron places the little girl in her mother's arms. In the middle of the Berry living room was a Fabray sandwich, but it doesn't take long until the grown ups were tickling the little girl in Quinn's lap.<br /><br />&quot;Nooooo Zayzay! No tickles!&quot; Lulu shouts, &quot;Gamps Noooo, No.&quot; But they don't stop and just laugh in delight at the giggles escaping the little girl. Quinn who had her arms around her daughter so that she wouldn't escape felt a pinch in her heart, and a wave of sadness envelopes her. &quot;Momma No tickles!&quot; begs her daughter, she was about to reply but apparently took to long since everyone was now looking at her, Lulu was turned to her with a frown on her face.<br /><br />&quot;What's wrong baby?&quot; Quinn asks.<br /><br />&quot;Momma sad?&quot; was all Lulu said. Quinn feels a small damp hand on her cheek, she didn't know she had started crying again.<br /><br />Aaron clears his throat and looks at his husband then stands up, &quot;Sweetheart I need help with something in the kitchen.&quot; Both men give mother and daughter some privacy. Subtelty does not run in the Berry family at all.<br /><br />&quot;Momma's fine baby.&quot; great she thinks to herself lie to your impressionable daughter.<br /><br />Lulu then puts her hands on her hip, in a perfect 'I don't believe you and I will glare until you tell the truth Rachel Berry Glare' (Patent Pending). Her eyebrows lift and she tries to stop the smile trying to break free. Lulu frowns at her and pouts. And she let's the smile blossom on her face, her daughter was just too cute for words.<br /><br />&quot;Momma sad.&quot; was uttered by her little girl, and feels contrite. 'great my own daughter can see right through me'.<br /><br />&quot;Momma just misses Rach that's all&quot; might as well tell her the sad unvarnished truth.<br /><br />&quot;Lulu miss H. Hug Momma, no sad.&quot; tiny arms wrap around her neck. She then wraps her arms around her little girl.<br /><br />&quot;Thank you baby, Momma feels better everytime Lulu hugs her.&quot; her daughter pulls away and gives her a dazzling smile, so alike to Rachel's she often wishes Lulu was their's. &quot;And because Lulu's hugs are awesome, Momma's gonna pay you back with Kisses.&quot; She kissed her daughter, on her nose, her cheeks her lips, her chin, she pulls Lulu up and proceeds to give the little tummy infront of her a loud raspberry. Lulu's laughter fills the Berry house, and she feels her sadness ebb away. She places the little girl beside her and they cuddle. It was moment's like this that made her happy she decided to keep her baby, she couldn't imagine not having Lulu in her life. And somehow it made things a little bit better.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Since that day like clockwork, at 6:30pm Rachel would call and talk with her dads, and Lulu. On friday's they'd have marathon Skype conversations, she'd smile just a little at hearing her daughter sqeal and laugh at whatever Rachel was doing or whenever Lulu would try and sing their favorite nursery rhyme stumbling over the all the words except star. She knew Rachel asked her dads about her, and once she saw David look at her silently asking her if she wanted to talk to Rachel, but she felt too raw and just shook her head and left the room. She just couldn't bring herself to talk to Rachel, let alone watch her on screen, so far away.<br /><br />There were days that Lulu would stubbornly refuse to go to sleep unless she hears Rachel tell her a bedtime story screaming &quot;H story&quot; at the top of her lungs until she gives in. And she'd pull out her cell dial Rachel's number and give her little girl the phone. She'd watch as her daughter ask Rachel for a bedtime story, and see her nod, in response to Rachel's questions. She'd feel her heart melt at how engrossed Lulu seemed to be with whatever story Rachel was telling her, and smile gently as Lulu succumbs to sleep. Gently removing the phone from Lulu's hands she'd place it against her ear. This was her guilty pleasure, this was the only time she could speak to Rachel. And like all the other times before, when they still shared a room or the first time Lulu demanded a betime story from her H. She whispers &quot;Goodnight Rachel&quot;, and she hears a &quot;Goodnight Quinn&quot; before the call disconnects.<br /><br />She knows it doesn't make sense, that the only time she could talk to Rachel was to whisper a goodnight. But for her it was the only thing she could say to the other girl, without crying her heart out and begging for forgiveness, for a chance, for her to come back. She didn't want to be the selfish bitch she used to be, that was her past. She outgrew that Quinn Fabray. But she needed to do this, for them even if it meant not talking to Rachel for the forceable future.<br /><br />----<br />Her life since Rachel left was just too downright depressing.<br /><br />On the first week of LWRB (or Life Without Rachel Berry as she dubbed her current life), she walkled down the halls of home and school with a smile, a smile that never reached her eyes. She tried very hard to pretend she was ok, until Friday rolled around, and she realized it was Rachel's pick for a movie. She ended up crying in Aaron's arms, as David tried to make a bawling Lulu stop crying since Quinn was crying. It was a night of tears, tissues and sniffling. It was also the first night she slept in one of the Berry's arms that didn't belong to Rachel.<br /><br />On the second week of LWRB, she was a mess. She found herself crying over everything, it was honestly worse than when she was pregnant. A song that they liked to sing to Lulu, A piece Rachel wanted to be part of Glee's repertoire, A teacher calling Rachel's name only to take it back since she was no longer there. Rachel's favorite ice cream flavor, her favorite movie, her favorite show. Quinn has taken to wearing some of Rachel's clothes that was left behind. The gleeks, especially Kurt and Santana was&nbsp; mortified and amused with that latest development.<br /><br />On the third week of LWRB, Quinn started wearing sun glasses to school, not to look cool but for necessity. She had circles underneath her eyes, Lulu has been getting increasingly difficul, almost always begging Rachel to come home in each phone call. &quot;H home peas.&quot; she'd say with a small quivering voice, Quinn would never hear what Rachel says, but she'd see her little girl nod, look at her then say &quot;love H.&quot;, then Lulu would walk or crawl to where she was and just cling to her, softly crying, and once her baby girl was asleep, she'd cry too.<br /><br />On the fourth week of LWRB, Quinn finds herself always with one gleek or another, they seemed to have made a team decision no to leave her alone. Even if it were a weekend, they'd have wii, ps3 and rockband days (Artie), spa days (Kurt), silly kiddie days (Brittany and a reluctant Santana)<br />, shopping and diva days (Tina and Mercedes), action packed movie days with a lot of maiming, killing, blood and gore days, it only ever changed when Brittany wanted to watch a cartoon or comedy (Santana and Brittany), Driving around without a destination days (Puck and Lulu), Pop and Lock days (Mike and Matt, unsuccesfully teaching her to do hip-hop) and even a day when all of them are together just being kids playing with Lulu. It takes her mind off of things for a little while, until she thinks of how Rachel would have had fun with them and she goes back to being gloomy.<br /><br />On the fifth week of LWRB, Quinn breaksdown after dropping off Lulu at Puck's, Puck takes her in his arms, she tells him how much she misses Rachel, and that she loves her and that she just doesn't know what to do. Puck surprises her with what he says: &quot;Look Quinn, I knew it was only a matter of time before it happened, We all kinda knew you were both you know, into each other. But have you really thought this through? I mean yeah ok, you want her to reach her dreams, so what happens to you? are you like going to wait for her to come back? what if she doesn't.&quot; when she just cries harder he continues on, &quot;For a time I thought we'd have our chance you know, and i gave that up, and after seeing how you are with Rachel, and how you just glow when you're with her, I know I could never ever compete with that, no one can. So I hope you know whatever it is that you're doing, coz I don't want to see either of you hurt, more than now that is.&quot; It was at that moment that she realized, that Puck maybe an asshole sometimes, but he made a great friend and father.<br /><br />On the sixth week of LWRB, after bringing Lulu to daycare and making her way to School, instead of class she heads straight to Ms. Pillsbury. She cries her heart of for two hours, while the guidance councilor just rubbed circles on her back. After cleaning herself up, Ms. Pillsbury tells her, &quot;Have you ever thought that maybe going after your dreams deserve merit too? I know you said that you weren't worth it. But Rachel seems to think so. And we both know that Rachel will work on it until she gets it. I'm not saying that you made a mistake, but you never stopped and asked what Rachel wanted. What if she falls in love with someone else? How will you cope with that?&quot; She glares at the guidance councilor who's eyes grow impossibly large. &quot;Quinn, I'm just trying to make you see the other side of things here. I'm pretty sure that Rachel is as miserable as you feel, and the only one who can stop it is you. You need to figure out if this sacrifice is worth losing the one thing you want. You need to let go of the belief that you don't deserve to be happy, and that&nbsp; everyone else has forgiven you, maybe you should start forgiving yourself too.&quot;<br /><br />On the seventh week of LWRB, Finn pulls her aside after Glee practice to tell her that he was very worried about her, and that if she ever needed to talk, about anything at all he could listen. She knew without a doubt that she looked as miserable as she felt. When Mr. Schue shows up at the Berry's asking how she was holding up, she knew she was way in over her head for thinking she was strong enought to pull this off.<br /><br /><br />On the eighth week of LWRB,&nbsp; She had cried herself to sleep once she was alone, Brittany had come over as if magically knowing that Lulu was crying after a short conversation with Rachel.Since Lulu was spending the weekend with her &quot;Dada&quot; and &quot;Grama&quot; she had asked if Brittany wanted to hang out the day after before she left. In the bed she had shared with Rachel, she listened to the voicemail the brunette left for her over and over again, until she succumbed to sleep <br /><br /><a href=""http://insanely-quirky.livejournal.com/8134.html#cutid1"">part 3"

Home, it still blows her away that she calls they berry household her home. After her parent's and Finn kicked her out, Rachel took it upon herself to give Quinn and her unborn child a place to stay. A place to come home to.<br /><br />Aaron (Mr. Berry or Dad) the african american man that reminded her of Eddie Murphy and David (Mr. Berry or Daddy) the jewish man that reminded her of Mr. Bean whenever he's in a coat and tie. Were the kind of parents she wished she had. They opened up their home and their hearts to her, and when her baby was born, they doted on her and loved as her if she was their grandchild, they even made her call them gamps (short for grandpa (Aaron)) and Zayzay (short for Zayde (David)). And sometimes she really wishes it were the case.<br /><br />The rain continues on, and she vaguely thinks of playing in it, The baby was with Puck and his family, and the Berry's were on a date. The rain made her forget that the silence in the house meant she was all alone. Silence meant thinking and coming face to face with the fact that Rachel wasn't there and that she wouldn't be barging through the door anytime soon demanding that she stop sulking in their room.<br /><br />Rachel. Rachel was gone. It's been two months, two long miserable months without Rachel. Rachel who was in New York, after getting the call that she's been waiting all her life. Junior Year, during Regionals, a talent scout saw and heard Rachel sing, got in touch with her and offered an opportunity of a lifetime. To go to New York, and pursue her dreams. She had stayed in Lima as long as she could, but two months ago, she made her way to the big apple, to get a head start.<br /><br />She feels her heart clench she never knew it was possible to miss someone this much that tears make her vision blurry but she doesn't even try to stop them from falling. Rachel was in New York. She missed Rachel, her Rachel. The Rachel who was there for her when everyone else avoided her. The Rachel who rocked her to sleep when everything in her life didn't make sense and she'd end up crying. The Rachel who put up with all her weird cravings and made many a midnight run for them.The Rachel who sang to her unborn daughter proclaiming that it helped in fetal development. The Rachel that would drag her out of their room even when she didn't want to and forced her to watch a movie.The Rachel who threatened Puck and Finn and in all her 5'2 glory told them to stay away from Quinn and to stop stressing her out. The Rachel that took her shopping for maternity clothes. The Rachel that talked with her when she was thinking of keeping her baby. The Rachel that bought her a onesie that said &quot;Mommy's little star&quot; as a surprise. The Rachel who for 10 minutes ran around like a headless chicken in the music room when her water broke. The Rachel who after finally calming down screamed places and had everyone run through their &quot;Operation: Water Broke&quot; battle plan. The Rachel whose hand she held as she was giving birth. The Rachel who cried silent tears with a smile on her face the moment Eloise &quot;Lulu&quot; Fabray was placed in her arms. The Rachel that softly counted 10 fingers and toes and sang &quot;baby mine&quot; softly to her baby when she thought Quinn was asleep. The Rachel who took turns with her for early morning feedings and diaper changes. The Rachel who doted on her daughter. The Rachel that made funny faces at Lulu to make the little girl giggle like crazy. The Rachel that would pout in the exact same way Lulu would when she put her foot down and took away their ice cream or chocolatey goodness. The Rachel that sang to her baby and read her bedtime stories. The Rachel that they shared a room with. The Rachel she was in love with. The Rachel she never thought she'd want a life with. Her Rachel that no one else saw and knew but her.<br /><br />There were times that she'd pretend that she didn't miss her, that she was fine. Most days it doesn't work, on those days she cries in her car, then cleans herself up to smile at Aaron, David and her Lulu. Sometimes walking through the halls of McKinley makes her think she sees Rachel at her locker taking out books, or in the music room playing the piano and singing, or waiting for her to go to lunch. It was worse at home, she sees Rachel everywhere, in their bed, in the living room, in the kitchen, even in Lulu's eyes.<br /><br />She grabs and holds Rachel's pillow closer to her body, and takes a deep lungfull of air. It still smells like her. And for a moment it didn't hurt as much.<br />&nbsp; <br />She remembers the night she and Rachel talked about New York. Lying side by side, she tried so hard not to beg Rachel to stay.Begging her to stay would be selfish, she didn't have that luxury.<br /><br />Roughly 2 months ago<br /><br />&quot;I don't understand why there is this need that I uproot my life as soon as possible, and not wait until I graduate from high school, I still stand by my decision to question the hastiness being required of me.&quot; Rachel bemoans.<br /><br />&quot;Didn't he explain it to you and your dads already? It's like you don't really want to go?&quot; Quinn queries knowing fully well that Rachel's dads where split between making her go and making her stay.<br /><br />&quot;I do, of course I do.&quot; Rachel exclaims &quot;But I find myself unable to abandon my short term goal of graduating from McKinley. Does it mean I have to take the proverbial leap of faith and let things fall as they may.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes&quot; Quinn says almost forcibly.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn! If you are trying to assist me in arriving at a decision on the latest development in my life, you are failing oh so miserably.&quot; Rachel pouts.<br /><br />&quot;Do you want me to tell you to stay and finish school? And let this opportunity pass by? I won't. You can always just get a GED or something. Isn't that like part of the deal anyway, you finish all the necessary credit you need there, and you still get your diploma without staying here stuck in Lima Loserville.&quot; don't sound so bitter, don't sound too sad, was the mantra Quinn saying in her head.<br /><br />&quot;I find myself unwilling to go since I know I will miss certain events and milestones, Lulu is just starting to talk in full sentences, and I want to be there to witness it happen and teach her to sing on key of course. And Regionals is coming up and we should practice to reach optimum success.&quot; was Rachel's answer.<br /><br />Quinn lies on her side facing Rachel, soon enough their facing each other, and she was unable to stop her hand from gently cupping Rachel's cheek and pushing some her behind her ear. &quot;Rach, Lulu is still going to be here when and if you come back, it's not like we can't talk over the phone chat or skype. And I'm pretty sure that Mr. Schue can handle glee even if you aren't there. Why don't you want to go, I was expecting you to have packed your bags by now.&quot;<br /><br />Quinn suddenly finds herself on her back with an armful of Rachel Berry. &quot;I don't know&quot; she barely hears Rachel speak, as if spilling her deepest darkest secrets, &quot;I know this is a very good opportunity and I'd be a fool to let it go, if i had been asked 2 years ago, if this had happened then, I would not dilly dally and have grabbed it with both hands, and would be in New York right at this moment.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;So what changed?&quot; Quinn asks, afraid and hopeful of the answer.<br /><br />&quot;Everything Quinn. I just, it used to be the only reason I allowed myself to just dream of reaching New York after graduation was my dads. Now there's you and Lulu and Glee. And I'm currently torn between my dreams and my reality.&quot; answered Rachel with so much passion Quinn's heart skipped a beat.<br /><br />&quot;Rach--&quot; Quinn stars but was interrupted as Rachel sits up and she follows suit.<br /><br />&quot;I need you to know that I'm invested in your and Lulu's life, you both a part of me now,both a part of my family. And me leaving would entailI leaving all of you behind, to follow this dream that has now changed to being just that a dream. It does not mean that I am no longer improving and evloving myself for broadway, because I am. But some light has been shed on certain areas of my life and priorities that I re-evaluated and came to a conclusion that I will still have Broadway and New York after High School.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Are--, are you saying No to this opportunity?&quot; Quinn asked<br /><br />&quot;That is where the problem lies, Quinn, I feel so conflicted and it's making my stomache for a lack of a better term, all acidy.&quot; was Rachel's reply.<br /><br />Quinn laughs at the face Rachel made whilse saying 'all acidy', &quot;If I were in your shoes. I'd do it. Even if it hurts, and I'd miss my friends and family. Chances like this happens once in a lifetime Rach. You deserve this chance to shine like the star that you are.&quot; she counters while moving to hold the other girl close.<br /><br />&quot;I have no justifiable reason to feel the way that I do, I just feel that if I leave now, I will lose so much. And the possibility of that happening has made me change my mind about leaving.&quot; Rachel holds her tightly.<br /><br />&quot;I'm going to be right here. Rach, I'll be right here waiting for you and cheering you on. Nothing has to change. We'll still be friends, and you'd still be Lulu's favortie.&quot; was Quinn's whispered promise.<br /><br />Rachel suddenly sits up, Quinn follows suit and faced Rachel who stared at her with wide eyes, &quot;I--&quot; she starts, swallows and then &quot;Quinn there is something that I need you to kno---&quot;<br /><br />Quinn panics at this, things between them have evolved so much that it wasn't hard to read each other. Over time both girls had developed a deep friendship and then something more. Both of them have spoken to their peers about this development individually. And all of the gleeks had a bet running when Quinn &amp; Rachel would become &quot;Quinn&amp;Rachel&quot;. Rachel had planned on wooing Quinn, but with this opportunity it had to be pushed back, until this moment. But Quinn didn't think it was the right time, she didn't think she deserved Rachel.<br /><br />Placing her fingers against Rachel's lips, &quot;Don't ok. Don't say it. If you do you'd make it harder for you, for me, for us. Just don't. You can't do that Rachel. Go to New York and take them by storm. Just please don't do what I know you're about to do.&quot; She pulls her fingers away and looks down. Rachel was too close.<br /><br />Quinn could feel Rachel's breath on her cheek, her heart was beating so hard. &quot;But Quinn, I--&quot; Rachel touches her chin and makes them face each other, &quot;I need to say it. I want to say it. I don't want to leave without knowing we had this chance and didn't take it.&quot;<br /><br />Their faces was only inches apart, and Quinn couldn't look away from her Rachel. Her Rachel that was practically laying her heart on her sleeve, but she had to look away. She had to turn around and make Rachel choose New York and not her. Things have changed between them so many times and this, this was something she desperately wanted. But she couldn't be as selfish as she was before. Even if it meant letting Rachel go. She wanted Rachel to reach her dreams of stardom and success, she wanted Rachel to be able to make it. Letting Rachel say it, telling Rachel she felt the same would be reverting back to who she used to be, before Lulu and before Rachel.<br /><br />&quot;Don't Rachel. I can't ok. Just go to New York. We'll be best of friends. Nothing more, nothing less.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No Quinn. We could be so much mo--&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Please Rach. I can't be that&nbsp; on top of everything else. I'm not worth it. It's not worth it. I can't let myself feel that way.&quot; She gets out of bed then, and walks to the door. &quot;I don't need to tell you that you're amazing Rach. We all know that you are, and&nbsp; you deserve New York and Julliard and everything else. So take the chance, make it happen.&quot;<br /><br />Rachel just looks at her with sad eyes and trembling lips.<br /><br />&quot;Make it to the top Berry, or so help me god if you don't I'll hop on a train and kick your tanned ass till it's sparkly and red, then teach Lulu to...to abhor anything musical&quot; She tries to joke, and Rachel only sniffles as an answer.<br /><br />Quinn just sighs at this, &quot;I know what you feel Rach, but I, I don't deserve you. You deserve so much more than me.&quot; and with that final statement she makes her way out the door, and didn't hear Rachel silently whisper &quot;You're worth it Quinn, worth giving up everything for.&quot;<br /><br />It takes them days before they could be around each other without a few tears escaping or fumbled words. It takes Rachel a week and a half to get everything sorted and packed. One dreadful Sunday morning, Rachel was on her way to New York. The gleeks had already said their goodbyes during the send-off party Friday. Quinn was a bit miffed at how Santana kept looking at her with pity and Brittany's constant need to hug her and ask her if she was ok, she really didn't want anyone to remind her how Rachel was really leaving, even if she forced her hand in a way.<br /><br />----<br /><br />While waiting for Rachel's flight to be called, Quinn watched with a sad smile as her daughter clung to her H as if she was a human teddy bear.<br /><br />&quot;love H, Lulu love H.&quot; her baby exclaims while giving Rachel sloppy kisses, Rachel laughs at that with tears in her eyes.<br /><br />&quot;You do huh, how much?&quot; asks the diva.<br /><br />Lulu proceeds to stretch her arms as wide as she could and exclaims with a grin, &quot;this much H, like momma!&quot; She hugs Rachel again, and then turns around and sees Quinn watching them. &quot;Momma, Hug H?&quot;<br /><br />She walks slowly towards them willing herself not to cry, crying while saying goodbye to Rachel was such a cliche. And she's already reached her quota of cliches that could last a lifetime.<br /><br />She vaguely notices David step forward and grab Lulu telling her to say byebye to her H and that they should look at airplanes or something, it's a not so subtle attempt to give them some privacy. She also knows that David knew why Rachel suddenly decided to go ahead and leave Lima. She wasn't sure if she was going to be greatful or mad at him, she resigned herself to coming to a decision for that and all the other things she needed to iron out on their way home.<br /><br />And just like that night that she found herself with an armful of Rachel Berry. She feels her breath leave her body. Her mind blank except for the knowledge that she was holding Rachel possibly for the last time, and soon she had to let go. She feels Rachel pull back, and had to steel herself from holding on tighter. Rachel raises her head and looks at her forlornly. She feels the hands on her hips tighten their grip as if she was afraid Quinn would bolt.<br /><br />&quot;Ask me to stay Quinn. Tell me to stay here with you and I will. New York and everything connected to it will still be there tomorrow or months from now. But I need you to ask me to stay.&quot; She hears tears in Rachel's voice, and with one hand wipes a few that escaped her eyes.<br /><br />&quot;I don't think I've ever told you how beautiful you are. You are so beautiful Rachel, it breaks my heart how beautiful you are and how I never knew it just reflected who you were inside.&quot; said Quinn, as if she didn't hear a word that Rachel just uttered.<br /><br />&quot;Tell me to stay Quinn. Nothing has to happen beyond that for now, Just don't let me go.&quot;Rachel said almost begging, and Quinn just shakes her head at that.<br /><br />&quot;I'm letting you do this Rachel Berry. I need to let you go. Someone as wonderful and amazing as you doesn't deserve to stay stuck in Lima, doesn't deserve someone like me. You're a star Rachel, I can't stand in the way.&quot; whispered Quinn close to tears.<br /><br />&quot;Quinn, please don't do this. Don't let me go thinking you don't---&quot; pleaded Rachel.<br /><br />Quinn was so close to giving in Rachel never begged for anything, but she had to stay strong for herself, for Rachel, &quot;But I do, so so much. And I know you don't understand why I'm doing this. I need you to know that it's because I do, and this is the only way I know how.&quot;<br /><br />And as much as she told herself she shouldn't, As much as she pretend she was being strong. In the end she wasn't, she couldn't stop herself from wanting to know how it felt to kiss Rachel, how it felt to be kissed by Rachel.<br /><br />It was a short kiss, almost fleeting and still she knew it was going to be one of the most amazing kisses she'd ever have in her entire life. But she pulls away cause if she doesn't she'll never let go, and she couldn't do that to the one person who deserved the world in a silver platter. &quot;I'm sorry...&quot; She whispers, and finally lets her hand fall to her side and walks away. Not once looking back, even as she heard Rachel sob, and Aaron's comforting words.<br /><br />She couldn't bare to look at the plane as it flew away, even if Lulu kept asking her to say byebye to H. She barely remembers how she got into the car. When the realization that Rachel really was on her way to New York, and that she was the catalyst to it all made her want to claw her eyes out and at the same time cry a river, whichever comes first. She notices Aaron glancing at the rear view mirror at her reflection. She takes a deep breath and breaks the silence that enveloped the small moving vehicle.<br /><br />Quinn breaks the silence by saying, &quot;We can be out of your hair by Tuesday.&quot;<br /><br />She suddenly grabs unto Lulu and her carseat when David swerves, once he has complete control of the car, Aaron reaches over and rubs his arm.And Quinn utters a mortified 'I'm so sorry'. Turning around to look at her Aaron just gives her a blank look and says, &quot;We'll talk about it later Quinn.&quot;, she almost didn't want to reach the Berry's.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://insanely-quirky.livejournal.com/7772.html"">Part 2</a><br /></span><span style=""font-size: large;""><br /></span></lj-cut>"

I can&rsquo;t believe you! You actually had the audacity to come here and demand that *your* daughter come home and leave her *bastard* behind. I am now a firm believer that you are as heartless as Finn said you were, and you call yourself a good honest Christian.&rdquo; I was fuming, torn between throwing Mrs. Fabray out and comforting Quinn who was too distraught to say anything. &ldquo;I am going to make it my personal mission with the assistance of my fathers&rsquo; that you and your infernal family never ever hurt Quinn or her daughter ever again. The door is open, see yourself out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><o:p></o:p><span style=""font-size: small;"">&lsquo;<i style="""">My poor Quinn&rsquo;</i> I think to myself wishing I knew how to make her stop hurting, it was only hours ago that she gave birth to a beautiful baby, Moira Fabray. I watched her eyes light up the moment she held Moira in her arms. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so beautiful Rachel, so beautiful. I can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s finally here. She&rsquo;s perfect, my baby girl.&rdquo; She whispered in awe. She had tears of joy in her eyes, and was smiling in the most exquisite way. </span></p><p style=""line-height: normal;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">She was happy if only for a little while, the moment her mother stepped in her room, I saw Quinn&rsquo;s smile falter a little, a little weary of what could happen, but also hopeful. &ldquo;Mo--, Mom what are you doing here? Look at how beautiful my baby is.&ldquo; the beautiful smile on my Quinn&rsquo;s face falls once she sees her own mother scoff at the word baby. Daddy gently takes Moira and puts her in her basinet as Quinn starts crying as hurtful words come flying out of her mother&rsquo;s mouth, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the tight grip Quinn had on my hand, I probably would have slapped her mother.</span></p><p style=""line-height: normal;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">I wipe her tears away and then gently gather her in my arms, she looked so broken, so desolate. My heart ached for her. I didn&rsquo;t know how to fix this, I didn&rsquo;t know how to make her stop hurting.</span></p><p style=""line-height: normal;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&ldquo;How could she say those things Rach? Am I that unlovable? Is my baby really that big of a mistake?&rdquo; she asks me pleadingly. I kiss the crown of her head, and hold her tighter. I didn&rsquo;t even stop my own tears from falling. &ldquo;Oh Quinn, never think that. They don&rsquo;t deserve you Quinn, they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; I tell her, hoping it would be enough, knowing it wouldn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p style=""line-height: normal;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">We started as mortal enemies then became team mates once she joined glee, after sectionals I asked her to live with us and we became awkward housemates. In a matter of weeks we became friends, she became my own cheerleader, and I became her rock. Everything changed, I saw her for who she really was, and she broke down the walls I had built around me to survive. She was the one who initiated our first kiss, and I was the one who asked her out on a date. We had a synchronicity that we couldn&rsquo;t find with anyone else. In a way we were made for each other. </span></p><p style=""line-height: normal;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">And as she clung to me as if I were a piece of driftwood in the open sea I knew I had to make her see, to make her believe that her mother was wrong. </span></p><p style=""line-height: normal;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&ldquo;Keeping Moira, having her is not a mistake.&rdquo; I tell her, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo; I lie down against her side in the narrow hospital bed. &ldquo;Close your eyes Quinn, and just imagine how beautiful your life will be with her.&rdquo; I softly whisper. &ldquo;Think of the first time she calls you Mama, the first time she walks.&rdquo; &nbsp;I wipe her tears away. &ldquo;Think of her first Christmas and Hanukkah, her first Birthday.&rdquo; I watch a small smile grace her lips. &ldquo;Think of her first day of school, the first time she goes on stage, think of all of your firsts together. All of those beautiful things are going to happen, how could keeping her and loving her ever be a mistake.&rdquo;</span></p><p style=""line-height: normal;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">She opens her eyes and looks at me before looking down, &ldquo;And you Rachel?

She takes a deep lungful of crisp, clean, cold air. Yes she was close, she was almost home.<br /><br />An arm drapes itself on her shoulder,  prompting her to turn her head. <br /><br />&ldquo;You ready to go?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yeah, thanks for doing this, Noah. I wanted to keep it a surprise.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Eh, had nothing better to do you know.&ldquo;<br /><br />With a nod, she walks towards the car parked in front of her and gets in, just a couple more minutes and she&rsquo;d be home again. She could feel her heart burst with emotion, and wills herself not to cry. She keeps telling herself just a few more minutes, just a few more miles, and you&rsquo;ll be home. <br /><br />When they pass by McKinley High, she remembers the first time she saw her, how she was captivated and so taken by this beautiful creature. She remembers being afraid, of what she felt, and what it meant. She remembers the first time she saw the other girl look at her, really look at her and how she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself from looking back. She remembers the first time they talk, without animosity just uncertainty and shyness. She remembers how she barely heard anything over the sound of her racing heart after she told the other girl, <em>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m in love with you</em>&rsquo;. She remembers how she felt electricity pass through her body when said girl pulls her close and whispers &lsquo;<em>me too</em>&rsquo; against her cheek.<br /><br />Just as they pass the park near school, she remembers all those afternoons spent together. Just talking about the baby, glee, school, Finn, Noah and their future together. She remembers the first time they kissed under a blanket of starts, and how magical it was. They were stargazing and chanced upon a falling star wishing she could kiss the other girl, and she did. She remembers staring at the other girl as she watched the sun set, and how she was absolutely beautiful and how lucky she was that the other girl chose her, over everyone, over everything. She remembers promising herself that she would do whatever it takes to make her happy and to love her no matter what.<br /><br /> A couple of more blocks and she&rsquo;d see her family again. She&rsquo;d see her lover, her wife, her everything. She couldn&rsquo;t stop herself from thinking of the first time they made love. They were both so scared, both not really sure what to do. Both in awe of the beauty before them. Soft curves, and silky hair. Sighs and muffled moans. Slick heat, and goose bumped skin. She barely remembers how it began, it was slow and beautiful. Whispered words of worship, of love, whispered names, and pet names , murmured requests, pleas. Shallow breathing, gasping for breath, clutched sheets, nails raking against bare backs, hands mapping arms and legs and breasts and hips and faces, lips tasting lips, skin and sweat. Tongues fighting for dominance, discovering new tastes and textures. Eyes filled with love and devotion, dark with want. Faces touched tenderly, gazed with adoration. Bodies moving together, shuddering in climax, shaking with release, sated and basking in the afterglow. And even after all these years, making love with each other was like that for both of them. Beautiful.<br /><br />The car turns left, and she could see their house. She couldn&rsquo;t stop the smile on her face, when she sees all the decorations littered on their lawn and roof. The kids loved Christmas, and their faces would light up, just like the lights all over their house and all over town. The car pulls to a stop, and as she gets out, she couldn&rsquo;t believe she was here, she could make out people thru the windows, seemed like their friends made it. Noah leads her to the door, telling her he&rsquo;ll get her stuff later. He opens the door , checks if anyone was in the hall then ushers her inside into one of the many hiding places in her house then whispers &ldquo;Stay right here and we can get this surprise underway .&rdquo; She gives him a thumbs up and watches as he makes his way to the living room, he could hear a squealed &ldquo;daddy&rdquo; and a few &ldquo;hey puck&rdquo; thrown around. Knowing that the other woman was waiting for her call She pulls her phone out of her pocket and dials a number she knows by heart. The phone doesn&rsquo;t even ring before she hears her voice.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey baby.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Hey back, you sound tired.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Just lonely.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I miss you too&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;So, what have you been up to?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You know the usual, I couldn&rsquo;t wait till I could get home to call you. I miss you.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I wish you were here.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I know baby.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Remember our first Christmas together? When we couldn&rsquo;t agree if we should do Hanukkah or Christmas and we just argued all week long.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Only to agree that we should just do both, if only for the gifts.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;then we spent most of the holidays in bed.&rdquo;<br />They share a small laugh<br />&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t complain then.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;If you were here I wouldn&rsquo;t be complaining either.&rdquo;<br /><br />She hears muffled voices and then<br />&ldquo;Puck just got here, and he tells me I need to help him with something in the hall.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Go ahead, just call me back.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Promise? You aren&rsquo;t too tired are you? and you haven&rsquo;t spoken with everyone else.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Promise, I&rsquo;m not, just go find out what he needs help with. &rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Stupid Puck, he just had to need me at the exact moment I finally get you on the phone.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok baby. I&rsquo;ll wait for your call. I love you.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Love you.&rdquo;<br /><br />She hears two sets of footsteps making their way to where she was hiding. She hears Puck say &lsquo;wait here, I&rsquo;ll get it from my car.&rsquo; Moving a bit, she could see her standing near the door, waiting for Puck to come back in. Who was carrying a couple of wrapped presents. &lsquo;Here these are for you guys, and I have a letter for you right here.&rsquo;<br /><br />She watches her rip open the envelope, and reads the two words, written on it. And she does exactly what those two words said. She turns around.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hi baby, I&rsquo;m Ho----mff&rdquo; she never gets to finish the word, and just finds herself in a very tight embrace and a welcomed lip-lock. It seemed like ages since she last kissed her, last smelled her, last felt her.<br /><br />&ldquo;What are you doing her, I thought you were, dammit Rachel you know I hate surprises!&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t get a chance to answer cause Quinn is kissing her again. Holding her close.<br /><br />&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to be away from you longer than I already was, I saw an opportunity and grabbed it.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Rachel I, god I missed you. I love you.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Best Early Christmas present ever!&rdquo; Rachel watches a tear fall from Quinn&rsquo;s eye.<br />She wipes it away and whispers &ldquo;Oh Quinn. Don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo; <br />Batting at the hand touching her face Quinn scoffs &ldquo;This is all your fault Berry, you know how much I hate surprises, and how I don&rsquo;t like not having you home for special occasions and what the hell, getting Puck to help you was very, very sneaky.&rdquo;<br />Rachel just laughs at that, and kisses Quinn soundly on the lips, &ldquo;One, it&rsquo;s Berry-Fabray not just Berry. Two, I know and I know, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m home and Three, I couldn&rsquo;t ask Finn for help, he&rsquo;d fold like a cheap lawn chair if you as much as glare at his direction.&rdquo;<br />They laugh and share a few more kisses, they end up just looking at each other, basking in the knowledge that they were together.<br /><br />They didn&rsquo;t notice Puck slip away and give them privacy, if only for awhile. They also didn&rsquo;t know he went ahead and got the rest of the family for the surprise. Still lost in each others&rsquo; eyes. They didn&rsquo;t see two other people with Puck. Not until<br /><br />&ldquo;Mama home! Mama Home!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mama you're home!&rdquo; was heard at the same time.<br /><br /> A blur of blonde hair was the only thing Rachel saw, before she felt little arms hold her across her waist. She kisses the top of her head, &ldquo;Oh sweetie, I&rsquo;ve missed you so much!&rdquo; Squeezing the girl to her. &ldquo;Mommy was right when she said you&rsquo;ve grown. Let me get a good look at you.&rdquo; The little girl lets go only to twirl in a circle then launch herself back into Rachel. &ldquo;My Becca sure is pretty, just like her Mommy.&rdquo; Getting a bright red blush on Becca&rsquo;s face.<br /><br />Quinn uses this time to take their two year old from Puck, and walk over to Rachel. &ldquo;And how is my other pretty princess? Hmmmm?&rdquo; Tickling the young brunette in Quinn&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Mama home! Mama home!&rdquo; the little tyke then leans over and proceeds to give Rachel sloppy kisses. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right Lucy, oh wow, I&rsquo;ve missed you so so much!&rdquo; Kissing Lucy one last time, she scoops Becca up in her arms, turns towards Quinn and grabs her she holds her girls tight. &ldquo;I missed you all so much&rdquo;<br /><br />They hear Kurt and Mercedes scream that the party was in the other room, Santana adds her two cents saying they better not be making out in front of her nieces. It was then followed by Matt, Mike, Tina and Artie screaming Mailman probably at Finn. This prompted Brittany to ask why the Mailman would be around at this hour and weather.<br /><br />Setting Becca down, who promptly ran towards the Kitchen screaming, &ldquo;Grandpa, Granddaddy Mama&rsquo;s Home.&rdquo; With a wistful smile she reaches out for Quinn&rsquo;s hand and walks to the living room. After hugs and kisses were exchanged and after catching up with her Dads, she finds herself cuddling Lucy who was falling asleep on her lap, just watching each and every member of her family interact, have fun, be together. She missed this, she missed these people. Turning her head she sees Quinn looking at her. She missed Quinn and their girls. <br /><br />With a smile, she knew she made the right decision.<br /><br />After a few hours, their little get together was winding down, everyone said their goodbyes, with promises of meeting up later in the week. She checked in on her daughters, made sure they were tucked in and after giving them both a kiss. She makes her way to their bedroom, and looks at all the pictures strewn across the walls, moments forever immortalized in images. Quinn pregnant with Becca, Becca&rsquo;s Birth, Rachel holding Quinn who was holding a sleeping Becca, Puck holding Becca with Finn beside him. Winning Sectionals, Winning Regionals, Homecoming, Graduation, Mr. Schue and Ms Pillsbury&rsquo;s wedding with all the glee kids in attendance. Summers in New York. Her first Broadway production. Her Dad walking her down one aisle while Her Daddy walked Quinn down the other aisle, Becca as their flower girl, Their Wedding Reception. Her pregnant with Lucy, Lucy&rsquo;s Birth. Quinn holding Rachel who was holding Lucy, Birthdays, Holidays, Anniversaries, Events. Frozen images of what filled her life with meaning. Her family, her loved ones, her life.<br /><br />She finds Quinn waiting for her to get in bed, She slips in behind her spooning the blonde.<br />&ldquo;How long are you here?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about it tomorrow, but I&rsquo;m here to stay.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Rachel , what?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Shhhhh tomorrow ok?&rdquo; She then kissed Quinn on her nape, below her ear, and her shoulder.<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you so much Quinn, I never want to be without  you and the girls.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re right here Rache.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the same.&rdquo; She holds Quinn tighter and could feel tears in her eyes.<br />&ldquo;Oh baby&rdquo; Quinn turns around, and wipes away her tears, &ldquo;None of this crying Berry-.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Berry-Fabray&rdquo; Rachel interrupts.<br />&ldquo;Fabray, I wasn&rsquo;t done. Quit interrupting me&rdquo; Quinn smiles at her, and gives her a kiss<br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here now Rachel Berry-Fabray and that&rsquo;s all that matters. &ldquo;<br />&ldquo;Yeah, your right&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always right&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;And humble&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;hah!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I love you&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I love you&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice having you home.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be home.&rdquo;<br /><br />Here in her house, with her children down the hall, and in her wife&rsquo;s arms, she was home, and this time she wasn&rsquo;t leaving.</lj-cut><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

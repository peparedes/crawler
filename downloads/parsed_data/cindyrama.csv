"event","Happy 2006 Everyone!
I just saw a photo of myself five years ago and I don't even remember that happy, active person.  So many difficulties have changed me to an entirely different person.  How do I get back to where I was?  How does a person undo so much damage?  It's not just the years - I know it has to be the events and their combined unhappiness.  In five years I feel as if I have aged fifty.  I even see things differently.  I just don't know my way back.  Anybody got any practical (or even impractical) ideas for reversing the process of depression?
I'm really needing some kind of help."

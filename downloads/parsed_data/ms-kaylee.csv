"event","Well, I'm leaving the condo and buying a new house.  How exciting.
I'm getting a PPO on my mom and any other posse member of hers that she has harassing me.
I need to get my head in the game at work, too many distractions recently.
My mom is trying to get me fired.
My mom is a prostitute and a bitch.
She has sex with men for money, washers and dryers and vacuums.
You'd have to know the whole story, but that is the most important part.
She has my family turned against me.
My birthday was a little lonely this year.
But those who do care about me, worked hard to make it enjoyable and I appreciate that.
I was late for work again, tell me something we don't know.  Lol.
I obviously hate updating my journal, but I wish I could do it more often.

Yes, I am still planning on posting the letter as well as my long update."

"event","I know, once again an update was promised and noce again it is not there.

At least this is Jenny, not Kaylee.  So, this would really only be the first time breaking any promises.  

I am caught up with... take a guess... yes, work AND everything with the home, the house, the car, family, friends, ex friends, the roomate, etc... life is just crazy right now and the one thing I cannot get behind in is work.

I am hoping tomorrow will be an easy day with time to update and post the freakin' letter.

I miss all of you guys.  :)

It will be long and all about the stuff you guys have been asking me about (i.e. My pile of family emergencies around Christmas, etc).

AND IF I WANT TO LET SOMEONE ELSE WRITE IN HERE, I CAN DO THAT TOO.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, TAKE YOUR PRETTY LITTLE EYES, THAT BOO-HOO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO SUCH HORRIBLE THINGS IN LIFE, AND DON'T FUCKING READ IT.  

IT'S A FREE COUNTRY AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS DUNJA, ROSEMARY, ANONYMOUS AND WHOEVER ELSE I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR (EXCLUDING AMANDA WHO HASN'T SAID ANYTHING AND ASHLEY WHO SEEMS TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE, SOMEWHAT, AS JENNY) I HAVE THE RIGHT TO WRITE WHATEVER THE FUCK I WANT AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING RIGHT TO CHOOSE NOT TO READ IT.  OF COURSE THOUGH, YOU SHOULD HAVE NO RESPONSE TO THIS SINCE YOU ARE SO ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS DISAGREEMENT.

AND IF ANYONE DOESN'T LIKE IT, TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR OPTIONS.  YOU HAVE THE BACK BUTTON ON THE BROWSER, YOU HAVE PLENTY OF OPTIONS TO LINK TO ANOTHER PAGE ON THE WEBSITE, YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE LITTLE X BUTTON IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER AND IF ALL OF THOSE FAIL, YOU MAY RESORT TO POWERING OFF YOUR COMPUTER.

NOW, SHUT THE FUCK UP.

"event","Hey all.  This is Jenny and I am going to update because I feel like it.  I am currently at my cousin's work helping her with tax stuff.  Of course, another late night here.  I will be here probably until 12am'ish and then I will be back tomorrow to go over W2's with her accountant.  BLAH.  I HATE some things in life.  I really do.

I have been reading all of my friend's journals and then some.  I do it while I am on break at work and I know I never update, I only go on Kaylee's name to comment--that is changing tonight.  I always liked the idea of this livejournal thing, but I never wanted one.  I wonder why...

Gosh, I have been so silent, just reading people's updates during my breaks-from-work at work.  Probably a lot more than I should, but regardless, I've read all these entries of people that I wanted to keep in touch with.  I thought it was such a bright idea for someone to create this *lj* thing--what a great way to keep in touch and talk to people that are busy or far away... and to some extent, that's probably true, but maaannn, does it suck at one thing... bringing you back to high school.  Bringing back that nostalgic feeling... remembering lockers and passing time, off-campus lunch and hallway jams... it reminds you of the F.A.K.E. girls who are so superficial that their beauty only runs skin deep... their worth depends on when their make up is just right or it's measured by how many guys hit on them (at school?!) a day.  You see them, EVERY hour in the bathrooms, fixing their hair, hogging the mirror, rubbing their lips together to mesh their lipstick (that they just applied an hour ago in the same bathroom AND in class before the bell), while looking themselves up and down and pulling the shirt down, pushing the bra up, crunching the ends of their hair, dabbing on more cake, oops, I mean concealer... do you remember those girls?  Ugh.  I thought the bathroom would be AT LEAST 50% for actually using the toilets/sink... but damn, if those full-length body mirrors made commission... they'd be rich.  I can understand checking yourself out real quick if you happen to be in there to use the bathroom... but damn, those girls abuse that.  

Those are the girls that you see constantly longing for attention from the guys.  You see their whole world/attitude/posture/facial expressions/gestures/body language change when a guy gets near them.  They suddenly start blinking their eyelashes a hundred times more a minute, they squeeze their butt in order to make it look a little more firm, they stand up straighter, they use more slang/giggly talk/laugh, they smile more... most importantly, this is when they feel the most complete.  And also most importantly, this is how you pick out the girls from the women.  They only feel good about themselves or important when a guy is looking at them.  In order to feel that they are desired, a guy and not just any guy, a guy 80% of their classmen obsess over, must compliment them... but not in a normal, real-world way... in a ""I want to fuck you because you're so hot today"" way.  A way that somehow means NOT that she is truly radiant or beautiful that day... but in a way that means she looks better than her enemy or she looks better than someone else... that someone else doesn't feel as good as she does at that moment because that guy chose her to compliment out of all the other girls.  It only matters when it is on some sort of scale... a scale that rates her higher or lower than any other competition.  These are the girls you should feel bad for.  I do.  

You begin to wonder what exactly is in that brain of theirs.  Air?  Sometimes, when 7 girls pile all into that same mirror in the bathroom, you can't help but to truly feel that you know the true meaning of an ""air-head.""  They might as well stand back, stand in a single-file line, with the most F.A.K.E. girl in front... arranging from most fake to least... this way, the mirror will have a break for once because it only needs to see the first girl in line... after that, you see right through them all, right down the line... every single one of them is the same.  They don't care about their grades, they don't care about having to move out on their own soon, they don't care about their character or how much they've developed (or will develop) over the years, they don't care about personal strength, will and wisdom... their biggest concern are the boys, the make up, the clothes, the parties, the flirting, the showing off, the reputation of being sexual... the list goes on.  How can you not feel that this encompasses the true meaning of an airhead?  A bimbo?  A braud?

I told myself that after high school things would change and they did.  I surrounded myself with friends that I could trust, laugh with, talk to, count on, party responsibly with--friends that I could not live without.  NOT ONCE since I have been out of high school has one of my girl friends (who in high school, I was SO oppossed to having) gotten into a fight with me or one another about a ""he-said, she-said"" ordeal.  NEVER.  If we have something bothering us, we bring up privately, it's discussed between those involved and it's solved.  For what would the meaning of true friendship be if you couldn't be open, couldn't talk about what you're being open about and couldn't solve what you talked about being open about?  Confusing, but true.  I don't run to Joy and say, ""Omg, Marcella is SO pissing me off today!  I can't stand it anymore!  God!!  She's such a bitch sometimes!  Remember that one time last year when she..."" and the gossiping continues... BUT ONLY HERE because in my real life, that doesn't happen.  I made sure I kept the friends that wouldn't turn into that or turn me into that kind of person.

Just listen to some of these girls.  Listen to their stories.  Listen to their ups and downs of life.  Listen to the things in a conversation that they accent in order to let you know that they are the main points in the conversation.  For instance, Joe Schulte was a life-long friend of mine... not exactly life-long, but since 6th grade.  We still talked up until his death.  His death will never get easier... it will only be gotten used to.  The pain will never change.  The hurt will never fade.  The memory will never die.  But over time, I will adjust to him not being here today.  I don't forget about him, I don't care less, I don't cry any less, I don't feel any less sorrow or anger... I just adjust.  In reading one of the ""girls"" entries (she is in high school, my old hs) and it talks about Joe being missed and the very next line skips to a party.  It's like it's just an obligation to show that you once knew him... it's just a way to prove to others that you have the right to say you're hurt... it's not a sincere feeling or a thought-about remark.  It's just a little phrase with almost no meaning.  It's abused by you and when you toss arounds words as easily as, ""He was MY friend TOO, so anyways, tomorrow night is a party..."" those words become a meaningless group of letters.  The sound fades, the meaning is long-gone and the heart in it... well, there is none.  And if you continue to do this all the time, soon, all of your words become the same--a meaningless group of letters that just float from your mouth into one person's ear and out the other.  These are the girls you REALLY should feel bad for.  For their words are as meaningful as their self-worth under that make-up and size 4 pants (when they SHOULD be wearing a 6, 7 or 8).  Little or none.

Then, read their entries.  How many talk about school?  Okay, how many talk about caring about school?  Not many.  ""Oh, I got a D+ in this class, so my mom is pissed, but oh well... I just hope I can go to that party this weekend.""  Sure, I didn't think about school all the time in high school or my grades.  Yes, I thought about parties too.  But a journal is for your feelings, your thoughts, your concerns, your doubts... these girls just use it as 1. A way to have ""live journal fights""   2. A way to brag about how many parties they had over the weekend and how many guys they ""got with""  or  3. A way to post 800 dolled-up pictures of themselves.  You'd think that somewhere in their journals they would talk about life, about something real, something meaningful.  You like taking pictures?  That's fine by me.  Hey, you just got a new digital camera or webcam and want to try it out, go for it.  But damn, when they make a website and you can tell that they go home from school, cake on more layers of their face, get in their cutest outfits and pose in front of their camera for 100 pictures... some of which they try acting like they didn't expect it coming or like someone else took the picture from afar when you can see their outstretched arms shooting the picture themselves... it's so lame after awhile.  I don't even care if you have a whole section of pictures of yourself, hey, I have a website with some pictures of just me on it too, but that's it.  It's a few pictures that were taken, mostly not by me, a long time ago that I put online when I was about 12.  AT LEAST throw in a category or two with your boyfriend or your favorite animals or even friends and some family.  Get over yourself.  Please.  Stop acting like you were surprised about the picture being taken, stop dolling yourself up trying to sell yourself for something you're not, stop being superficial and self-centered.  If you have a website with personal shots of yourself on it, I'm probably not talking about you.  Like I said, I don't mind that... well, I'm sure you guys know who I'm talking about or at least know someone who does the same thing.  If you feel that I'm talking about you, I probably am... although, I'm not directing this toward any specific journal or person.  Some people who do this aren't superficial... some people like taking pictures and that BY NO MEANS makes you superficial or shallow--that is not what I'm saying.  Mmhmm, I guess this is my entry and I don't have to explain it... if you are still reading and are interested, I'm sure you get my drift.

And these girls that draw themselves out to be hoes and then complain when they are called just that... it blows my mind!!  Every other sentence in their journal has a new guy's name in it.  Someone that touched their ass at a party.  Someone that made them drink shots here or there during some weekend.  Some amazingly gorgeous guy that stared them down at some school basketball game.  Some guy that asked them to have sex because they looked so good that night.  EVERY entry has to do with some sort of bragging about a guy.  Then, they try to throw in these ""subtle"" clues that they had sex or they did this or that or they kissed him and she went this far with that guy... but wait, you'll notice that they hardly ever say or even want to say exactly what it was, but they will hint it and if you're a grown woman or have somewhat of a stable mentality, you pick these signs up right away and are not fooled.  In example, ""So, Matt sat next to me on the couch and BEGGED me to do a shot with him, so I did and mind you I was SO completely wasted by this point, but it was all good cuz I was with my girlies and we were partyin' it up like no other mofo and anyways Matt gave me this look and told me how hot I was... yeah, blah blah so that was that and I think I will leave it at that...""  hmmm, now, if that's all it REALLY was left at, there wouldn't be much to ""leave it at.""  It would end right there, but noooooo, they throw on some sort of tacky catchy phrase that makes you think more happened than they explained and for reasons which are unknown, they don't want to talk about it any further.  Me?  I have totally figured that out... many, many years ago.  Then, someone calls them some derogatory name and they get all defensive... ""you bitch, you slut, you don't know shit about me.  Keep talking your mad shit you don't know how me and my girlies roll, right girls?  you know how we do..."" and so on.  Their grammar/slang, by the way, really will get you laughing.  Then you wonder, at what age do they grow up?  At what age do they stop talking like that, writing like that, thinking that?  The ones who do all three--talk, write and even THINK like that... oh dear lord.  These are the girls you should REALLY, REALLY feel bad for.  And to spoil the end of the story... some of those girls never do change.  It's sad.

You know it's really gotten bad when they judge their friends by outrageous meaningless scales.  ""Who will compliment me the most?  Who will be cute enough to bring around hot guys, but not cute enough to take attention away from me?  Who will listen to me if I tell them not to like a certain girl because I don't like her?  Who will run their mouth the most at a party to back me up against someone they don't even know because my mouth got my own ass into trouble it couldn't handle?  Who will get so drunk with me that we can come to school Monday and have 15 HILARIOUS drunken stories for our 16-year-old friends?""  It's sad.  I know that if I am at a party, my friends don't let me embarasses myself or the company I work for.  For starters, I'm not that stupid.  Drinking to get drunk was way back then.  This is now.  Social drinking is fine, but to get drunk for the sole reason that you have stories to brag about on Monday--c'mon... how old are we?  What kind of friend lets you ""get with"" a guy you don't know at some random party?  What adult party/company party have you been to that adult women have shouted or cussed at each other over school, friend, boyfriend or miscellaneous rivalries?  You don't.  They are adults.  They carry themselves in a different manner, they act different, they think different, they handle things differently... they ARE different.  That, my friends, is what separates the girls from the women.

Just remember--some of those girls, never change.  Open your eyes--do you see what I mean??  Read the subject line once again before you comment.  Please though, feel free to share your opinions.  Anyone, everyone.  I'd love to hear it. :)  I hope everyone had nice holidays.

Love,
Jen."

"event","Wow, I have so much to say right now, but no time.  Since I missed almost all of last week (work) due to about six (major) family emergencies in two days, I came in today at about 1pm thinking I would just do some of the end-of-the-year-bullshit like emptying, refiling, reorganizing, switching folders, making new folders for all the company's, etc... but it's now 1:23 A*FUCKING*M in the morning and I am here, alone, at work, in Detroit.  Actually, the reason I updated is probably to stall myself... I really don't want to walk out to my car.  I've been watching the cameras and nothing seems to be happening, but I keep thinking of those movies where they tape over the camera's recording, so that it LOOKS like nothing is happening... I think they did it in Speed? (w/Keanu Reeves?)

Well, I guess I'll just call one of the guys over from the bar to walk me to my car.  Thank god it's a bar next store and that we've been friends with them for like 30 years... that way they don't have a problem coming out for me... even if it is 2am, lol.

Anyways, I must get going.  The hunnie is at home, lonely, after his car accident and other two trips to the hospital, which I will explain in my next update.  I should be taking care of him, but man... I missed A LOT of work.  I have to catch up.  I have read a few journal entries of other people though and damn... lol, I have a lot to say.  Some people... and the things those people think... the things they think they know.  Yes, I am talking about YOU.  Yes, YOU.  ;)

I guess I will have to hold my fire for later.  I have a long, freeway drive home from this scary city, but I am *SO* thankful this week is over... these heartbreaking moments in my family are over... I don't have to look at his cold body lying there anymore...  most of all, since I haven't had any sleep, but the sleep I've obtained from the sleeping pills my mom gave me (as a result of her having the same problem of not sleeping with all these family issues)... I am so EXTREMELY glad I get to sleep in tomorrow.  Monday is back to work.  I missed it.  I came in for 4 hours (total) last week and I truly missed being there--or maybe it was just that I'd rather be at work than at his funeral... 

Ahhh.... details later.  :)   I hope everyone's Christmas and New Year went better than mine."

"event","Well, my shopping is pretty much done.  My wrapping--that's another story.  Another day with the office to myself!!  The guys came to get their checks and we all stayed in here and bullshitted for 20 minutes or so, then they all went home.  Nobody worked today except for me.  How dedicated I am!  ....sitting online at work, Ha.  

So, the fiance and I got into a little arguement last night... over his mom... AGAIN.  That fat ass physco, skitzophrenic, dillusional, alcoholic, druggie, lying, manipulating, conniving, poor, lazy, slob, pig, jealous, convicted felon, dirty bitch will never change.  He said he wrote her off.  He wrote her out of his life, for good now.  I know how horrible that sounds, but thank god.  It's about time she stays away from us and stops harassing us.  I love having my boyfriend's phone on my company account!!  You better believe the first thing I did this morning on my way into work on those shitty roads was called Nextel and had his phone number changed (FOR THE 3RD TIME!!!!! BECAUSE OF HER!!!)  On top of that, he doesn't know her cell or house number by heart and he deleted both numbers (and her) from his phone last night.  So, the only contact she could have now besides driving by our new house would be to call my phone because my number isn't changing.  Finally.  I am so sick of her.

It was sad though because he was giving me a massage while he was confessing his freakin' love for me, which is GAY.  I hate hearing that shit.  I am not a mushy person and it's like piercing my ears when he whines like a baby about loving me and trying to make me happy.  Anyways, we were watching ""Surviving Christmas"" (with Ben Affleck?  It was a good movie) and I was laying down on the bed.  He was doing my entire back side while he was talking with this heat-activated massage oil from Bed, Bath & Beyond and he starts crying.  (PUSSY)  Well, I'm lying there and his tears start falling down on my back.  Then, after getting fed up with hearing his excuses, lies, explanations and confessions of love... I started dozing off and then, every tear drop that fell woke me up because it was so cold on my back with that warm oil.  It was kind of weird.  

Well that seemed to be a bit graphic, but hey, you could have stopped reading after the first clue.  I got my bonus check today... $500!!  And my paycheck was fat.  So, that's nice.  Tonight, is Christmas with my stepdad's side of the family.  Then tomorrow, Christmas at my mom's with that side.  I am not all that excited.  I am not a holiday person.  I don't like receiving gifts or opening them.  In fact, I didn't get Chris anything yet and I didn't want to.  I wasn't planning on it.  I told him not to get me anything either because well, I just don't like doing gifts all that much, especially with boyfriends.  Of course, he's gotten me like 50 things already and he was really upset that this year he's not going to get one gift--not from his family, not from his parents, grandparents, etc.  The only people who will get him something are the people in my family.  His family is just... fucking wacko.  So, then I felt bad.  I thought to myself how I would feel if I didn't get along with my family and I wasn't even invited to the family Christmas dinner and then to have a boyfriend of 3 years who ""didn't feel like"" getting me anything, but yet he went out and got all of his friends/family/coworkers stuff.  His feelings were really hurt, so I asked if we could at least do presents after Christmas because right now, I don't have the time to shop.  Like anything's open anyways.  He doesn't want to and he was baffled that I went to the mall and got something for Will (the guy that I'm infatuated with at my work) that was engraved/personalized/expensive at Things Remembered and I got some other people gifts and I got myself a purse and a wallet, lol selfish, but I didn't even bother to get him anything.  I tried to explain to him that I didn't plan on doing gifts, but he just kept sulking.  See, I'm not one of those girls that you ask what they want for Christmas and they say, ""Ohhhh nothing.  Seriously, I swear.  I don't want your gifts or money.  I just want you.  For real hunnie.  Don't get me anything..."" when inside, they're dying for that new Tiffany's bracelet or necklace... or they want flowers or teddy bears or gift certificates.  Those are the same girls that you ask them if they're hungry or what they want to eat and they either say, ""Nothing, I'm not really hungry"" or they say, ""Ok, I'll have A crouton and a small glass of water.""  If I'm fuckin' hungry, I'm gonna fuckin' eat.  I'm not gonna lie.  I'm not scared to eat in front of guys or anything of that sort.  I grew up and out of that a long time ago.  It's the same way with the present thing.  If I say I want nothing, I truly don't want anything.  I am not a fan of exchanging gifts, I hate opening gifts (especially in front of people), I am not a high-spirited person when it comes to celebrating holidays.  After 3 years, you'd think he would know?  The only holiday I see fit for exchanging gifts (besides spoiling all the children at Christmas, Easter, etc) is one's birthday.  I love to spoil people on their birthday.  I don't know, maybe I'm crazy?

I was just looking through some journals and I just think it's crazy how people get into these ""local bands"" and every day they have a new member or they kick a member out or they have a new name.  I swear.  it's like, ""Hey!  We have a new name!  Check it out!""  Then the next day, ""Our new drummer is awesome!!  So-and-so is an asshole and we kicked him out.  This new guy seems to be great!""  The next week, that guy is gone and they have a new member AND a new band name.  Lol.  Then with each band name/group they say, ""We're so loyal.  We're so good, we're awesome! (Insert band name)For Life!!""  It's just so... weird?

I miss Nattalie so much.  Her and I have been best friends for 10 years and it's so weird having her at State and me here, so far away.  I miss a lot of people.  I guess after the holidays things will clear up, slow down and get back on track.  I can't wait.

I wonder what's going on for New Year's this year?!  Any good parties?  Is anyone doing anything really fun?  Like going to New York?  Anywhere?  Hotel parties?  Whatever, anything?!  I don't have plans yet but my boss throws a New Year's Party every year... god, it must be so nice to have all that freakin' money.  He throws these huge parties with live bands, catered food, huge tents, he has a deck on top of his roof that people dance, eat, party, bands play on, he has the jacuzzi and the pool, he orders like 100% clean/sanitary porta-potties so people don't track up his ABSOLUTELY beautiful house/white carpet going in and out of his 7 bedroom house to use one of his 6 freakin' bathrooms.  He has like 15 tv's and 7 KING size beds.  It's ridiculously expensive and it's all so beautiful.  I guess that's what ya get for living in/owning a business in Grosse Pointe.  Speaking of him, he just came in to thank me again for the Christmas gifts and to tell me he's leaving.  He's so sweet! :)  It so nice to work with a boss that you love.  He's like, ""What are you still doing here?  Go home!!!""  I think I will.  

So, I guess I gotta do a couple things and then I am going to get the hell out of here, go home, get ready and do the fam-thing.  I hope you guys all have a lovely Christmas since I won't be checking in until Monday.  I hope everyone (well, some of you) get what you want and eat lots of good food.  :)  

Natalie and Jeff--I remember my first Christmas with my fiance.  It was lovely. :)  You two will have so much fun!! :)  I wish you both the best and post more pictures!!  I love looking at them when I'm slacking off at work.  I think I've looked at every picture on the site and that you've posted in your journal.

             MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!"

"event","Well, good morning.  Finally, I have some peace and quiet!! :) Just kidding.  I love my guys, but I also love my free time on the job.  When we get in the new building though, that may not be happening so often.

So, I'm extrememly sick still.  It's getting worse.  My soar throat started it, then the runny/stuffy nose, then itchy/watery eyes, no sleep, working too much and now, it's like bronchitis.  My ears are plugged, so my sound is muffled and I absolutely HATE that.  They won't pop.  It's horrible.  Tonight, is the Christmas party and I seriously considered not going last night because of how sick I am, buuuuuttt then I thought about it and 1. I know the guys would kill me (their feelings are hurt if you don't go to the company functions) and 2. You can't pass up a huge party at a nice hall with free food, drinks and Christmas presents!

I got really lazy last night, so I quit wrapping fairly early and now, tonight is the party and I hardly have enough time to go home, shower and get ready... let alone wrap a bunch of presents.  So, I brought them to work and I can wrap them here! :)  How exciting.  Blah.

We did a lot of shopping last night and I am *SO* sick of holiday preparation.  I got pulled over by a Roseville ASSHOLE cop who was going to give me a ticket for being in the no-parking fire lane.  Notice I say BEING and not PARKING.  I didn't get out of my car and leave it there in the fire lane so that drivers could have a problem passing through the narrow parking lot road.  I stayed in the car so that when someone couldn't get by, I could drive up and down a few aisles and then go back.  I hate Roseville cops.  They were the ones who gave me my other (only) no-parking fire lane ticket last year.  Dicks.

You know, I was thinking about how horrible it is when someone's beauty is shattered after they open their mouth.  You see these girls/guys that are so pretty/hot and then their personality is just so unattractive.  I don't mean they don't have manners or they like to cuss.  I'm talking about those down-right evil assholes who are just miserable and bitter toward the world... yet they have such beautiful faces.  It's funny though, how their faces seem to appear ugly after you've seen them in action.  I was reading someone's journal today and that person is so good looking and then... you remember all of those horrible things they've done.  It's just... weird.

Well, maybe I'll update later today. :)  I have to get some work done.  :)  And you still have to love the haters. :)  It's funny how they have so much animosity toward me, but yet they are so interested in my life (or my cousin's?) that they read every entry I post, every comment people post in my journal and all of my info.  Gotta love those people with no life.

I am at work, as usual... all of the guys are out of the office on jobs today, so I locked up the building and made a quick run across the street to McDonalds.  Yuck!  I hate this food, but I can't leave the office for long because 1. It's payday, so the guys would have been in any minute picking up their checks and 2. because I have to answer the phones.

Will came in completely obliviated today.  His girlfriend called this morning to let me know he would be late because he was wrapping her up in wrapping paper in the middle of the street this morning--well, chasing her, trying to.  Then she put him on the phone and he was singing to me and saying all sorts of weird things.  Yikes!  Too much YAYgrRrRrr!!  He is a huge ball of fun though!

So, I'm going to have to leave this next story ""Friends Only,"" which I will do after I write this update, but for all of you out there... when is it okay to break the law?  I know teachers and certain issues bring it up, so if you don't understand my question, this may help:
*Is it okay to break the law by stealing?  Well, what if you were just trying to feed your children?
*Is it okay to break the law by committing traffic violations?  What if you had a person who was near death, bleeding to death, a child whose leg/arm has been broken or someone is in labor in your car and you were in very much of a hurry?  Would it be okay then?

Now, I'm not asking what you think the law would say, but what YOU think.  The story, my story, will be kept a bit of a secret.  God knows with my luck, the wrong person would read it, report it and I would be doomed.

Other than that, things are okay.  I had another migraine late last night and I woke up with the fire migraine this morning.  It was bad.  I used my 10s unit, an ice pack, my muscle relaxers and my Vicodin and it's finally gone!  Thank god!!

The bar next store is having a Christmas party tonight and I'm debating on whether or not to go.  Since those are our partners all drinks are free for us, but I don't know if I'm in that mood today.  I know I'll probably be putting in about 14 hours tonight at work.  Last night was 13.  Our audit is today.  YUCK!!  My boss and I sat around and talked for about 2 hours yesterday.  It was fun.  We talked all about our new building that we bought--we use it as a warehouse right now, but we're moving into it next year and I am *SO* excited!!!!  It's in Grosse Pointe, but it's gay because it's like 2 streets over from where we are now.  That's a real big move!  Or not.  I can't wait though!  It used to be a bowling alley and we bought it out, gutted it and now we're remodeling.  It's HUGE *and* it has a bar inside!!!!!  :)  We're a freaking office, but yet we'll have a bar at work!  I can't wait!!  I have a HUGE office that will be ENCLOSED unlike my current office, with my own bathroom and I am in charge of everything!  I decide where stuff goes, who will get computers or security cameras in their offices, where the files/cabinets/furniture will go... everything!  I can't wait!! 

I swore to myself I would come in here today and work my ass off--ummm, no.  I slacked off again.  :(  It makes me *SO* mad, but hey, I'm choosing to do it.  Well, if I want to get anything done, I need to update with my story and get off this website!  :) 

Cathy--email me the story!!  Dale--I am hoping to get back to you soon.  Same with Jess and Jenny Schmitt!  :)  I love all of you guys!!"

**********************************************************************************




Anyway darling, AGA-TOUGH-THUG... on the way to work this morning, on 95.5, I think?  They were doing a tribute to the people who have someone overseas, so they call in if they have a husband/wife or daughter/son or anyone in war right now.  Then, they say something that they would like the person to hear and then 95.5 would ask them some questions and stuff, then they have the caller give them the person's mailing address and they mail the audio tape of that radio conversation.  I may be babbling if you heard it already?... But if not, it was on at about 7am this morning.  This lady called in with her two children and they said, ""My husband is in Iraq and has been since August..."" she told his story and then put the young children on the phone and they said, ""Santa, I know you can't bring my daddy home for Christmas, but can you watch over him?  We love you and miss you very much...""  Then 95.5 asked them all about what he did for a living and how hard it must be to afford/celebrate Christmas without your significant other and it was just very sad.  I cried.

Then, as usual, I thought of you.  I never believed that love knew age, distance or time... and I just reassured myself  this morning.  It doesn't matter that you and Matt didn't know each other all your life.  It doesn't matter how long you guys were official.  It doesn't matter how old you guys are or whether or not you had ample amount of time to get to know each other or hang out.  You guys became accustomed to each other quickly and fell hard right away.  That doesn't mean that you're hurting any less than someone else with a husband of 10-15 years that is in the war.  You can be hurting just as much, if not more or less, than anyone else.  You sit at night thinking about the times you guys did have together and all the wonderful things that he had said and that you guys shared.  You look at hobbies, objects, pictures, etc and all sorts of things that remind you of him, his face, his hands, his words, his smile and so on.  You become nostalgic of the love you guys knew and shared.

And looking forward to the day he comes home... I can't even explain what we all feel when we're awaiting the words, ""I'm comin' home!""  You wait, wish, pray and hope just as much as the married couples do.  You ask yourself if Santa were real, wouldn't your one and only wish be to bring you baby home?  You ask yourself if miracles could happen, wouldn't you want your miracle to be bringing Matt home for good?  You dream at night about him walking off the plane and greeting you with a hug and a kiss.  You know that as soon as your eyes meet, your heart will melt.  You think about how your life will be different with him home... he can hang out with you and your friends.  You will have someone to cuddle with and watch movies with.  You guys can talk on the phone all night.  You can go to parties and family functions together.  

And your promises for the future are just the same as those who've been together for years.  You realize that once they are home, you swear to yourself and God above that you will appreciate them and everything they do.  You will love them for who they are.  You won't fight, you won't call names, you won't give him the silent treatment or waste precious time.  You will be together as much as possible and take time to notice the little things--those things that never really mattered to you, or so you thought.

You begin to live a little differently.  Things that went unnoticed now become a reason to smile.  The way he looked at you when you did something stupid--before it may have upset you or made you feel like an idiot--now, you can't wait to see that look again.  It's permanently etched in your mind only to be thought of by you.  You appreciate things that you never shared any gratitude for.  You long for some of his bad habits whereas before, you were annoyed.  

The feeling of love can be just as strong regardless of age, distance and time.  You don't need to have so many years behind you two to be considered ""in love.""  You don't need to prove your love to ANYONE.  There are no universal standards to live and love by and there are no exceptions to that.  Your love is just as worthy as everyone else's.  Don't ever forget that.  Don't ever believe that you need to explain your love to anyone in disbelief.  It is a love shared between you two and there is no rhyme or reason to give a synopsis to anyone.

Everything will be over soon darling.  This will make it all worth it.  Just imagine..."

"event","Well, well, well... 2 out of the 3 did just what I said they would in the last entry... I hate to say I told you so, ok wait, maybe in this case I don't mind...
Hypocrite?  Hypocrite.  In the largest degree.  For the smart bitch who will find that offensive and feel the need to ""moan"" some more... think about what you're saying, then look at what you're doing.  Practice what YOU preach.  H*Y*P*O*C*R*I*T*E*.  End.





Work has been very, very busy.  Amy and I had to weirdest experience last night with Darren... needless to say, it's a small world.  As soon as this ailment is taken care of, I will be back over there in no time.  Tonight, I am going shopping to get Caleb some clothes and things.  :)  Fun, fun.

The fiance is great.  As usual.  He's been taking great care of me since I've been sick and it's been wonderful.  I don't take care of him enough.  I wish I had it in me.  I'm just not mushy.  Last night, I slept on the way home and then he carried me inside and woke me up when my bubble bath was drawn.  Then, he cleaned our room and sprayed all this nice bed/aromatherapy stuff, lit candles, put on a movie and got me settled in bed while he cooked me my favorite dinner.  He kept checking my temperature, giving me cough drops, cough medicine, the muscle relaxers, etc.  He woke up in the middle of the night to check my temp. and give me my second dose of meds.  Then, this morning he came home (before I even woke up) with orange juice (for my throat), my favorite cappachino and my flavored water.  It's been swell.

We got Collateral last night... ehh, thought it was going to be better.  The ending really sucked.  Most movies though, now-a-days, don't have very good endings.  I hate that--you watch this entire movie and just as you're waiting for the best ending that will capture the entire movie's goodness, the black screen comes on and the credits begin rolling.  It's like reading a really long book only to realize someone ripped out the very last chapter.  Annoying.

Jen, if you're reading this, thanks a lot.  I will check my email, but I'm VERY happy and thankful that it wasn't anything to be concerned about.  Same with Jessica--I will check my email soon hun.  :)  I hope things are going somewhere, they will though. 

Natalie and Jeff, I'm *SO* happy for you guys.  I can't even imagine the anticipation you're experiencing.  I don't know if I'd be able to handle it all.  You really deserve it though.  I can't believe you have a countdown.  Lol, that's so cute!!

Speaking of that name, I miss my Nattalie.  She's up at State and it's been awhile since we've had a regular conversation.  Everything is so short because we're both so busy.  I hope she's taking care of Giancarlo for me... gosh, how I miss that boy.

I missed both Marcella and Joy's calls last night due to my early bed time.  Ugh!  I hate being sick!  I feel horrible with everything about Joy's stuff for exams and I'm so happy that she understands.  It's those friends that you care about so much that would do anything for you.

I have most of my Christmas shopping done, finally.  I didn't get my mom, Bryan, or the fiance anything yet--of course, the most important people.  I have Christine, Kristine, Amanda, Nicole, Alyssa, C.J., Abby, etc all out of the way.  I'm so excited--my Christmas bonus at work is $500 this year!  That's a nice chunk of change, ya know?

I don't think I ever updated on the night I babysat Dominic.  It was incredibly fun!!  We played ball, we went in the jacuzzi, we played tennis, watched t.v. and movies, made dinner, then made a real gingerbread house, had dessert later, I read him some books, played tag, went over his flash cards, etc.  He is the cutest kid ever!!  I wish I had my damn scanner hooked back up so I could post pictures! :(  My boss gave me $220!!!  AND left money to order a pizza, which we didn't, so he tried giving me that $20 too!  When he got home he was tipsy (they went to a wedding), so I sort of sneaked out slithered out of taking the money.  I didn't do it for the money--I did it because I knew it would make him quit stressing out that day and because I love Dominic.  But of course, Monday morning he brought it in, yelled at me and told me if I don't take the money that he wouldn't let me babysit again.  I know he was kidding, but that's how he really is.  He hates when people do him favors and don't let him pay them back.

Well, things seem to be fine everywhere else in life right now.  Besides all the shit I have to do here at work.  I miss everyone.


Ags, I hope you're feeling okay.  :/  Christmas is a time to be with those you love and I can't imagine the pain....... we're all here for ya...  </3"

"event","Or not!  I hate followers.  I hate when people ""copy"" me or do something I do just because I did it.  I hate when I see someone saying something I say OR I hate when I see people do it to other people.  Like, you notice a close group of friends, so one gets her hair dyed and so does everyone else.  What's worse is when they do it and deny it.  It's one thing if you are doing PURPOSELY for the reason that you're all friends and YOU ALL WANT that color, but when they say, ""I do it because I like it, not because she did it or my best friend did it...""  when you've repeatedly watched them jock each other over and over again.

  Everyone is all cool, no problems, then because one girl has a problem, you see everyone's attitude change.  All of a sudden the other sheep act like I did something wrong or like they've had a problem with me from the start.  No, they didn't... and since then, I haven't done or said anything to any of them to make them change their minds during that period.  But it goes right in order 1, sheep 2, sheep 3.

  I don't know about you guys, but I like a person/friend/leader/boyfriend with their own brain, their own thoughts, their own ideas and most definitely their own statements.  I can't stand that middle school/high school game of ""hey girls, I don't like so-and-so because she looked at my boyfriend wrong, so now, all of you guys have to hate her too and be really mean to her!""  That is so not attractive and most definitely not mature.  You think that some people would graduate and move on to college as well as they would grow up during the process--I guess not.  



....Sorry Jenny.  You said they were really nice and I believed you.  





  Well, onto life... things are good.  This morning Will and I came into work at 6:30am to decorate the office with Christmas stuff.  :)  Last night I did some more Christmas shopping with the fiance and then came home and watched a couple movies.  The Company--a dance movie, which was okay, but it definitely had no point to it.  However, I love dance, so it was fine.  Then, he turned on some really stupid movie and I went to bed.  

  My boss didn't have a babysitter last minute tonight, so I offered to babysit Dominic, which is awesome because he is THE BEST kid EVER!  He's even telling me to leave work early so I can get there on time and he's going to pay me.  I'm going to have my fiance come because I have to be there until about 4am tonight.  So, after his bedtime, I will be so bored.  

  I will probably have to work tomorrow, BLAH.  Since I've gotten this thing I've been slacking off at work!!  Then, today I have to leave early and I have *SO* much to do.  Tomorrow, Jenny and I are going to see Amy because Caleb is coming home!!  But of course, Nick gets him for his eight hours on Saturday, which is bullshit, but you have to make do with what you have and try to make the best out of things. 


Yuck, I have so much Christmas shopping to do still and decorating... BLAH.  Not in the mood yet.

"event","I began finding some common interests with someone on here and she is in a really horrible spot right now.  (No names needed) Well, I guess I don't mean that... she just has something very huge breaking her heart and it's all up in the air for awhile.  I felt horrible, so I send her a small message just letting her know what I thought.

I get the sweetest thank you.  She was so appreciative of just the fact that I took the time to stop and think about her and how she feels when I hardly even know her.  We start replying back and forth and everything is okay.

I do the same for someone else and it's like... I don't know?  Wtf?  If it's bothersome that I thought you seemed like a really nice gal and added you, just let me know.  I'm not going to be fake.  I'm not a stalker.  I'm new to this thing, I just surfed around and found people I thought either she or I knew that seemed cool and looked for someone to talk to.  I don't understand why it has to be so difficult?  

Well, I am *SO* jealous of the relationship still.  I talked with my hunnie about it last night and we both were just shocked that he does everything right and that I'm still jealous.  I wonder if being shocked is the right [emotion?] for him to be?  I'd be a little pissed, but hey, he puts up with my ass!


Soooo, you all know my office is in Detroit, well, these [African Americans] always hang out in front of our office and walk around with boom boxes, fight, scream, yell and cuss at each other, sometimes start fights, dance in our windows, etc.  Today, I got REALLY annoyed, so I said something to them... like, ""Can you guys please hang out on someone else's block or in front of another office?  You're making me nervous and all the yelling worries me, so I have to keep getting up to check if things are okay...""  Yeah, this white girl runs tha block!!  Jk.  So, they get a little upset and get in their like 1779 brown conversion van WITH SPINNERS (Yes, I said 1779 and most def. I said with spinners) and they go to squeal off... well, lol, they run into the curb, still in front of my office, bust a FLAT and break their spinner!!  Lmao.  Holy shit, I had to smile and wave.  Then, I went inside, locked the door and I'm STILL praying that I don't get jumped after work.  Lol.  Gotta love the fucking city man!

Well, got payroll and shit to do, so I must be going.  :)

"event","Well Hello!  Let's try this motherfucker again.


  I am not ignoring any of you.  I miss you all and love you dearly!  I have been so busy with work and all though.  As you know, I work at a home improvement company and at this time of the year, every customer's roof is caving in or they have leaks in the house and they all think that we have no other customers and they want to be taken care of PRONTO.  Well, fuck that.  You know talking nasty doesn't work with me.  Get a goddamn bucket and put it under the leak bitch or stand under it and swallow, motherfuckers.

  So, first we want to start off with some shout-outs.  Thanks everyone for adding me back.  Hopefully, I'll get more in depth with this thing and I'll get a hold of more people I know on here.  Cathy, thanks for the advice!  Do you have a picture of the tattoo you're interested in?  I'd love to see it!  Aaron, you have ""friends only comment"" in your journal, so I tried to leave a comment and I couldn't.  I thought maybe if I added you I could get somewhere and I did.  Thanks for adding me back.  My cousin knows you, sorry for the delayed answer.  Hello to everyone else.  As for Natalie, I am so sorry.  Please, I know I upset you for assuming that I understood how you felt, but I don't want you to be offended by what will follow this.  --> As I was reading through your entries, I noticed we are so much alike.  I know, I'm sorry if it bothers you and I know a journal does not encompass your entire life or who you are as a person, it's just from what I read.  I felt like we have a lot of similar things going on in our lives, I thought that was cool, so I wanted to talk to ya.  I hope you're feeling better and I am so sorry for getting on your bad start.  What a bad start.  :/  I hope you've forgiven me.

  Now, onto life.  Well, as those of you who know me know, I have very horrible migraines and I am often hospitalized for them and soon to be getting surgery, well... I've been doing SO much better.  Untilllll... this season.  Where life, your bank account, your mind and your job (if you work at a home improvement company) all get a little, okay a lot, crazier.  I was already busy with the house, the boyfriend, the pets, the doctor appointments, work, family, friends, school and so on... but now, holy shit.  I am the only girl here (So all 20 guys belong to me only, yes), but that also means I am the only girl here to do EVERYTHING.  I mean EVERYTHING.  I could have three people on hold, one on the line, one of my guys 2-waying me needing something right away, someone at the front door, UPS at the back door, a fax coming through, two phone lines ringing, making copies and dealing with rude people all at the same time with no one to help.  It gets crazy 'round here.  I have another audit coming up (ugh!!!! December 17), so I've been putting in 14 hour days and I work in a freakin' office!!  It's not like I'm a roofer or construction guy.  I was sweating yesterday from running back and forth and things being so crazy.  My migraines are getting bad again.  It's horrible.  So, I brought my tens, my ice packs and my Vicodin and I'm hoping today is a better day.

  So, I've been reading through everyone's journals to update myself on my friend's lives.  I am *SO* jealous of this one couple!!  They are perfectly perfect as perfect can be!  Even though I have a great boyfriend, a great relationship and he says and does the same things her does, I am so jealous!!  It's like, I'm more attracted to her boyfriend than my own--and it's so weird because we are just as happy, healthy and in love, but that's just how it is.  You could think you have the most boring life, but someone out there is so intrigued by it.  They could have the exact same thing as you, but yet they're amazed by what you have.  I mean my boyfriend/fiance have our perfect love, our house, our dog, our cat, our cars, our jobs, our families, our friends, our trust, our sincerity, our honesty, our reliability and our love and it's just still appealing to me--what they have.  It's crazy!  Well, they should know who they are!!  Keep up the great relationship!  :)

  So, whose still reading?!  I don't care, I actually like this journal thing for me.  I was reading through someone else's journal and I'm so sick of those anonymous posters who start fights in other people's journals.  Yes, the journal is online and public, so what.  They shouldn't have to turn off comments just for those fuckfaces.  That's bullshit.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and that does not mean publishing it on MY livejournal just to be an ass, knocking me down just to be nasty or challenging my thoughts.  Yes, everyone wants to be challenged now and then, but these assholes aren't doing it positively or to be healthy or hand out constructive criticism--they're doing it to be downright nasty and to start fights.  I love how they relate anything to who you voted for.  ( ""You non-conformist, you're so blah blah and THAT'S why you voted for so-and-so..."" )  That's why I'll keep my vote quiet--maybe until I get one of those posters and then I can abolish everything they rambled on about by telling them who I really voted for.  Those dusches.  Then, I love how they claim they're posting anonymous because ""it makes people more mad,"" instead of just admitting they don't want to be found out.  You have to love those kinds of people who have all that time and like to spend it knocking others down on *lj* and spitting out intellectual words that usually don't make sense or don't fit their intellect.  

  You know how there are those people who do things just to do them, well not just to do them, but to say they did them?  Like, a girl likes a guy who likes a certain kind of music and even though she doesn't like it, she'll go to a concert that she knows she will hate or she will go buy his favorties cd's just to make him think she likes them?  And I'm not talking about girl's who intentionally step outside their comfort zone in order to experiment with someone they care for's taste in something, you know, to try and be open-minded... I mean the people who are being FAKE.  F-A-K-E.  Well, I know this one girl who walks around acting like her shit don't stink.  Like everything she owns or uses is the best, top-brand and most expensive.  I mean EVERYTHING.  From her shampoo, to her hair clips, make up, cell phone, school, car, accessories, clothes, medical insurance, etc.  Yes, from hair clips to her freakin' medical fuckin' insurance.  Well, she always walks around saying, ""I use Herbal Essence!  It's the most expensive in the whole store!""  Yeah, where do you shop?  The last I checked, Herbal Essence is stocked at the dollar store, which I'm not saying is a bad thing, but if you want to brag about it...  But anyways, then I know another girl who smells soooo good!  Everytime she walks by you or she takes her hair out of her pony tail to tie it up again, the whole room smells so fruity and yummy!  So, I ask her what she uses--Herbal Essence.  So, I give in and pass on my dollar store Dove shampoo and I get Herbal Essence and wow!  She's right!  It works and smells so good!  (though I have yet to hear someone say they smelled my hair from across the room?!)  Now, I got my hair chemically straightened twice two years ago and because of all the chemicals, I lose hair and get tangles all the time.  So, yes, I do spend a lot on my conditioner.  I get that $18.99 bottle of Paul Mitchell because my hair is so ruined from that straightener and I lose (I am not exaggerating) HANDFULS of hair in one shower.  But damn!  This Herbal Essence was like $5 and it works so well and it smells a whole hell of a lot better!  Try it!  However, it's definitely NOT the most expensive in the store--HA!  Fucking conceited, frugal BITCH!  Now, I'd love to get an anonymous poster who would use big words and try to relate my shampoo to who I voted for and whether or not I'm a conformist or a republican or liberal, etc.  How my shampoo can relate to that?  I have no clue, but try it motherfuckers.

  Lol.  I'm sorry.  I just read a really long and annoying anonymous post in my friend's journal and it really pissed me off.  Dusches.

  So, the boyfriend/fiance and I made up last night, which means HOT make-up sex!!  Lol, should I be telling all you that?!  Yeah, so we didn't go to bed until 4am and of course, I wake up late.  I use both of our cell phone's datebooks as alarms in addition to my regular alarm clock, so this morning I went to grab his phone to shut off the alarm and he had this glass of water right next to the bed/night stand, so it falls out of my hand and lands right in the water!  What the shit?!  I grabbed it out right away, but it's absolutely ruined.  No screen, everything is water-logged, won't power on, etc.  Now, what the hell are the chances that it would directly in that cup of water?!  Fuckin-A.

  So, Amy's birthday, I believe, is today--or tomorrow?  I know her's is today and Desi's is tomorrow or vice-versa?  Caleb was supposed to come home the 1st, but he didn't.  The adopted family still has him in their care.  I waited for her call last night, but she didn't call back.  :(  I am finally back in the groove with Amanda and Nicole!  :)  Not that we ever lost contact, but we weren't in touch as much as we wanted to be.  Now though, we're back on track daily and that makes me so entirely happy!  Joy and Marcella are over like everyday.  (Jeff usually everyday too to keep my boyfriend busy while us girls do our thang)  We're always up to something... us girlie's!!  Fun fun!!  Yikes, Marcella, Joy and Bianca's birthdays are coming up all this month so all of us and a few of our close girlfriends are going out to dinner and out for a night on the town!  How exciting.  Then, to celebrate, we're going to Canada I believe on January 8th.  We already have a list of like 50 people who are going with us and we're all staying at a hotel.  It's gonna be fun!!  Except that Lauren bitch has to come.  How ridiculous, why would she want to come after what she did?  She knows everyone hates her and no one will talk to her, which means no one will talk to Christine because she will be too busy trying to make Lauren feel comfortable.  I don't know.  It's always bad news with that physco bitch!!

  Geez, so I wonder whose still reading?  Probably no one.  Lol.  No one thinks I ever update, so they probably don't even look at this page anymore.  I'm sorry.  :(  I know I promised an update yesterday, so that's why I'm doing a long one today--to make up for that broken promise.  It's just yesterday was the first day that we were slammed from the weather.  I explained it already.  I didn't get out of here until 8:30pm and working in Detroit--that's not safe!  I was here all by my lonesome in this horrible area and I hate it, but we have the bar next door and they always look out for me.  They have the same security cameras we do and we both have a wall switch alarm... if something is wrong with me, I flip it and this alarm goes off all through the city and we're the only ones who have it.  It's pretty cool, but I still don't like being here that late by myself.  I just wish I was more accustomed to this *lj* thing.  Like how all the codes work and stuff.  How to put in pictures and all that good shit.  But I am so not used to this thing.  I wish it was as easy as doing my website on www.geocities.com.  Lol.  That was *SO* freakin' easy!

  I like so many other people's journals and this one awesome girl on my friend's list, Agatha (hi darling!!)  had the CUTEST journal ever and this girl (I think that worked with her) offered to redo her background/layout all the time and it was always so cute!!  No one has asked to help me, lol.  I don't know who I would trust though, with my password and stuff.  You know?  I don't know, this journal thing is pretty cool.  I like to read other people's journals--not only does it help me keep in contact with people, but it's pretty cool to see what other people are doing and what they're interested in.  I like to see all the different phrases and words people use to express themselves.  Like people say, ""it's major SUCKAGE!""  or ""that blows monkey balls"" or ""ya win some, ya lose some""... you get my drift?  It's just cool to hear all kinds of different phrases and usages of words.  I hope you all don't think I never read your entries.  Everyday, I read all of my friend's entries, I just don't write in my own.  That's the last thing I do IF I have time and something to say.  I always read your guy's though, everyday.  :)  I want to do some fun quizzes and stuff and I want people to do some fun quizzes for me!  So give me some bitches!  With the quiz you're going to give to me, include how to link it... like, it will say, ""A quiz for fun"" and you click and it goes to your comment page, sorta?  Cathy Baranski, you do it all the time!!  I want to know, but explain it slowly and in depth because I have NO idea how to work this thing.  ...If you even cared to read this far...  :(

  Everyone says I'm so private.  I never talk about anything serious or important if it has to do with how I feel and emotions, which I'm not denying, that is very true.  I am very personal and very secretive.  It takes me a long time to trust someone.  I was in a relationship with John for 3 years and I fell in love with him after about 8 months... it took me a year and 3 months to say the words, ""I CARE ABOUT YOU"" to him.  I mean, I thank him for putting up with me.  I guess he just reassured himself that I cared because for 15 months, I would not say the words.  Then, it took another few months for me to say, ""I love you.""  Shut up all you faggots who are saying, ""Omg, if you love someone, you can't hold that in.  You must not have loved him.""  No, that's not it at all.  First off, don't impose your version of what love is on anyone else.  You can't explain love and it is not a universal feeling.  There are people who fight every single day, but they truly love each other in their own personal way.  Second, I did love him, but I am not open about my feelings.  I act like a hard ass.  I do not cry.  I will not admit to it.  I don't share my feelings or express my feelings for people.  I am not public about anything.  I am a mystery.  So, for those of you who have waited to hear certain words for me or have stuck by my side trying to figure out the mysterious side of me, I am sorry.  I am just not a mushy person.  I do have feelings though, but I just keep them to myself.  So, my whole point of that was that I think I may turn this on Friends Only.  Does anyone have any objections?  Not that I'm going to be sharing my emotions, but I may talk about my life A LITTLE BIT, which is something I never do.  So, having this journal thing is like taking a risk and I'm quite nervous about it.  I may want to talk about my sex life or my boyfriend or my work... and everything that happens to me is personal.  I have a few people in my life that I tell my bad days to or my problems to or stories, but other than that... everyone else is strictly, ""Hi.  My day was great.  End of story.""  I am trying to change.  Counseling that my mom made me go to didn't work.  I mean, it made us better, but it hasn't loosened my tough skin.  If anyone else is the same and they understand or have advice--or you WERE the same and can tell me how you changed, please leave me a message.  I don't know how to be more trusting or to come out and be honest about my emotions or how to be comfortable crying in front of people who are close to me.  I just can't break that shell and no one can break down that wall that I have up.  Help?!?

  Anyhow, if no one has objections to doing friends only, I may do that, or maybe just on the personal entries.  Which reminds me of Jessica S.  No last name needed.  I hope you're doing okay baby!!  I'm sure it's still not over, but I'm still thinking of you and praying for you.  :)

  If any of you are still reading this, which I highly doubt, and your AIM sn is different than your journal name, please leave it in a comment.  Some of you ask me to talk to you on AIM, but you don't leave the sn.  Thanks.  Well, I think I'm going to get outta here.  I have to actually do some work today.  I'm totally slacking and I'm going to be totally behind especially since this is the second time I typed out this entire post!!  FUCKER.  I have to hit the bank after work.  Get cigarettes, gas, and groceries.  I have to fold and put away laundry tonight.  Hit Verizon since I totally trashed my hunnie's phone.  :(  Which reminds me how much I fucking HATE Nextel!!!!!!!  (They're our phone carrier for work, so we all have to have Nextels)  Omg, does anyone else here have a nextel?  Do YOU hate it??  Please share the Nextel disaster!!  I wish I had my Verizon back.  :(  Oh well, anyways, I have shit to do.  If anyone actually read through this entire thing, just holla at me.  I'd love to see if anyone did, just for kicks...

  Well, you lovely's all have yourself a B-E-A-UUUUtiful day!  I may post another thing today... an ""I hate it when..."" list.  I've been thinking of a lot of those pet peeves and I want to get them off my chest.  We'll see.  In fear of broken promises...there's no guarantee.  I love you guys!!  :)  Leave me some comments please!  I just started and I want to feel the love and have a nice welcome.  I know this is long, so I don't really expect it, but I'd like it. :)
Welp, time to go read your guy's, probably short, updates, lol!!!

"event","Wow.  I finally gave in and got one of these!!  :)  I am so excited about it too!  I used to just read them, but a few of the *lj* members turned ""friends only"" and that really inspired me to get one.

So, I have been really busy lately.  I have so much going on right now.  Last week I had to bail Sean out of jail.  I put up $1,000.00 and then the bondsman fronted the other $9,000.00.  If he doesn't show up for his court date, I am liable for seven years for that $10,000.00.  I'll tie his fucking ass up in my basement before that happens though!  Long story!!

Dusche and I got into a fight today.  He's a bad boy.  Naughty Naughty.  (he cheated on his girlfriend, which isn't cool with me at all, but shhhhhh)  I am totally against that, but I know everyone makes mistakes.  

Soooo, I really am considering getting my eyebrow pierced, but I need some encouragement.  I'm scared.  I have a phobia for needles.  I only had my ears done (because I was a child then) and my nipples (because I was drunk).  So, if you've had it done, have some encouragement or some disagreement, or know of a good place around Warren, lemme know please.  My tattoo looks really hott.  I was so excited to get it and I'm really glad I did.  But when I'm 55 years old and wrinkley, with saggy boobs and a cane, it will be so ugly. 

I will work on getting my user pic up soon.  I know most people won't add me if they don't have some kind of picture to look at.  Well, for you bitches who feel that way, I'm hott, I swear.  Lol.  :)  What ugly girl would get her nipples pierced?  That at least has to say I have an ok (at least) chest, right?  So, ADD me!!

Speaking of that, I know my journal is horrendously ugly right now.  I haven't quite learned all of the cuts and rules to setting it up like you beautiful people out there have.  Give me some time, I'll get it sooner or later.  Orrrr... if anyone wants to help me... that would be *SO* thoughtful.  :)  Just do it bitches!  Jp.  

Anyways, I have so much to do today.  Got class and work and all that so I must get going!  I can't wait to make new friends on here and be able to comment to all those *COOL* people with *RAD* journals!  


If I add you, please add me back!  I'd be <SO> excited!"

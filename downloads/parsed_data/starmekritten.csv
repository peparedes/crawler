"event","I woke up late today and then spent entirely too long at giant building all my displays. Then my dad called to yell at me. Whoo.

My second stop was easy. I put out 4 cases of 2 liters and was done in 10 minutes. I went back out to my car and saw that one of the tires was really low. Not quite flat, but getting there. I went to the gas station across the street and put air in the tire. I made it up to walmart but by the time I was done there, it was low again. But at least I was at walmart. I took the car to their TLE and told them to repair the tire. Long story short, the leak was in a place where they couldn't fix it so I had to get a new tire. Way to go DBG. They finally give me a new car and I'm spending money to get it fixed less then 24 hours later. It's a sexy little car though. They gave me a grey Civic. Very very cute. 

While waiting for my car, I went to talk to the Assistant manager. She called my boss's boss yesterday freaking out about the state of my backstock. She was apparently angry about me leaving my stuff laying all over the place. I explained to him that it was a recurring problem but that I wasn't actually doing anything wrong! He told me to have a talk with her and deal with it. Turns out, she was mad about all the ATreat damages and such. I had to explain that it isn't even my product! 

After the tire thing was taken care of and I was even more behind, I went to boyertown and then up to douglassville. At Dville, I started pulling the 2 liters I needed and stepped on a piece of wood from a broken pallet. I felt a sharp pain in my heel and lifted my foot. The piece of wood came up with it. I'd stepped on a nail and it went straight through my shoe and into my foot. I pulled it out but the fucker had gone at least a half inch into my foot. It was the twisty kind, badly rusted and broken so I didn't even have the benefit of being stabbed by something sharp. It was nice and dull for maximum pain. 

I managed to hobble to the break room for some paper towels and then sat on one of the top rackers in the back room. Chris (frozen guy) came over to see if i was alright and then called the manager back. Accident reports were filled out and stuff. I put some stuff out that i'd already loaded up on a Uboat and then went home. I guess I'll do the rest of my stores tomorrow.

Now my foot still hurts and I'm getting nauseous just thinking about that nasty thing going into my foot. I know you're supposed to go to the ER if you step on a rusty nail, but I'm UTD on my tetnus shots.. so I guess I don't need to? I don't fucking know. I'm not even sure how to really clean this thing. The opening is very small but I know it's deep. Puncture wounds are so tricky and it's worrysome because I know that thing wasn't clean and feet in general aren't that clean either. This thing is just waiting for a bad infection."

Students at Antietam Middle-Senior High School, which includes seventh through 12th grades, then were taken to a district building elsewhere.</p> <p>Police said that aside from the torch, the 13-year-old student had taken two bags to school containing knives, firecrackers, a small can of gasoline and a water bottle filled with torch fluid.</p> <p>He walked into a first-period English class and grabbed the 16-year-old girl, throwing her to the ground and assaulting her with a knife, police said.</p> <p>""The students who were in that classroom came to her aid immediately and disarmed him,"" Berks Regional Police Officer Raymond Serafin said.</p> <p>The boy got away, but Principal James Snyder and a teacher then confronted him in a hallway and talked to him for about 15 minutes. When it appeared the boy was unwilling to surrender, another teacher walked up behind the boy and swatted his arm, knocking the propane canister from his hand, Snyder said.</p> <p>""He was mad at a lot of people and a lot of things, and the school,"" Snyder said.</p> <p>Officials puzzled over the student's motive, saying he was not a known troublemaker or particularly withdrawn or brooding. Police found a note at the boy's house that they hoped would shed some light.</p> <p>""This was not a student who was a regular or frequent flier to my office for discipline at all,"" Snyder said. ""I've replayed this in my mind ... and there is nothing that triggers me to say I saw this coming.""</p> <p>The suspect, whose name was widely circulated by students but not confirmed by police, is expected to face juvenile charges that have yet to be determined. Berks County District Attorney John Adams said the boy will be kept at the county juvenile detention center pending the outcome of his case.</p> <p>The 16-year-old girl was taken to Reading Hospital with cuts to both hands, hospital spokesman William J. Rudolph Jr. said. Doctors also treated a 15-year-old girl with a small wound to her upper back and a 14-year-old boy with a small wound to his upper right arm, he said. All three have been released, Rudolph said.</p> <p>Serafin lauded the students who stepped in to stop the attacker.</p> <p>""As a parent, as an officer, I would be very proud of what those students did. They had to make a hasty decision whether they wanted to become involved. Very admirable,"" he said.</p> <p>The school is in Lower Alsace Township, about 60 miles northwest of Philadelphia.</p></div></div>"

"event","Today was my first day back at work. I woke up at some ungodly hour to be in bethlehem by 7am. Then after an hour long meeting, I took care of some stuff with HR (I swear, I must bug them more then anyone else that works there) and then drove out to Boyertown to clean out the car. 

Did I mention that I hadn't seen the car yet? After the accident, I sat curled up in a little ball in the drivers seat. I was disoriented and didn't know what the hell was going on. Some guy with a walkie talkie appeared out of nowhere and called the police, fire department, ambulance, etc. He told them to close the road due to debris EVERYWHERE. I could hear crunching as cars drove by. I managed to call my boss and told him that i was in an accident before hanging up on him. Then someone took me to the ambulance. So yeah. I didn't see the car until today....

God.. 

I totalled it. No doubt about it. The towing place gave me the liscense plate. 

The amount of damage I did to that car was terrifying. Thankfully, the impact was slightly more to the passenger side or I probably would've been in worse shape.&nbsp; The drivers side didn't look quite as bad. The impact even cracked the windshield in several places. 

The guy at the towing place told me the other car was totalled too. 

Work was awful. I was incredibly sore and my stores were left in terrible shape by the people that filled in for me. One of them even managed to lose one of my displays. Bastards. At 8:00, I got a case of the fuckits and went home. I completely skipped my last store. I figure I'll go there first thing tomorrow.. but they will probably be pissed."

"event","I woke up early this morning to get new tires. I figured I'd go to walmart and decided the one in Elverson was my best bet. They're never very busy first thing in the morning. I dropped my car off and decided to wander the store for a few minutes to see if there was anyone there that I knew. For the record, I know alot of people so I knew that there would be someone around to amuse me. 

I headed toward the grocery side and could see a cart loaded up with coke products. Fantastic.. I was not especially excited to see any of my former coworkers. I glanced down the aisle and saw keenan. I figured I'd at least try to make things right between us. He looked rather surprised (and not all that happy) to see me. By the time I left, he was smiling and took my phone number. APPARENTLY, there was a problem with his phone and his numbers got erased. I still think that he probably erased it after our last conversation. 

I'm glad to get that taken care of. Keenan was certainly not lover or boyfriend material, but we were good friends. I hope that we can remain that. 

And my car has new tires now. Yay! And I start my new job tomorrow! WHOOHOO! Wish me luck. The first week should be easy. I'll have someone else running my route with me. Hypothetically, that means we should get done twice as fast everyday. I'm sure that they expect me to just sit back and do what the trainer tells me to do.. but damnit, these are MY stores. I'll be calling most of the shots. And I'll chase of their trainer in a week."

"event","Today I went to Delaware with my mom. We went to Costco there. They have a liquor store there so I bought Kirkland Vodka, Jager, Baileys, and some wine. We did some other shopping and then headed home. We stopped at another liquor place on the way home and I picked up a bottle of Appleton white rum (which I'd never even seen) and a 6pk of Golden Monkey for Izzy. 

I went back to my parents house for a bit after that and then met up with Izzy at the Blue Dog. We then went back to her house and I met her boyfriend Jim. He seems like a decent guy. 

I eventually left around 11:15 and began my long drive home. I stopped at the Wawa in skippack to get some caffeine. Afterwards, I started heading up 73. Then my car started making a bit of a funny noise. It got a bit worse and I was afraid I had a flat tire. I pulled over and checked them all but everything seemed to be ok. I got back in the car and the noise and rattling got worse. I was freaking the fuck out because I was in the middle of nowhere. A car came up behind me and suddenly my car veered to the right.. I pulled as far over as I could and put the flashers on. I got out to see what the hell was going on. At this point, I had NO CLUE what it could be. I looked at the tires again and saw that the front right tire had exploded. There was little still attached to the rim and the rest was about 10 feet behind my car. It was soo dark and I didn't have a flashlight. My cell phone had no service, so i sat in the dark crying for about 5 minutes before a halfway decent cell randomly appeared. I called AAA and had the following conversation:

""My tire exploded and I'm in the middle of nowhere""
""Ok. Where are you?""
""Um.. Rt 73.. maybe a few miles west of skippack?""
""Can you be more specific? Can you give me a cross road?""
""There are no crossroads. I'm in the middle of nowhere. Not only that, but I really don't know where I am. I stopped at wawa in skippack. That was a few miles ago""
""Ok... I'll see if I can get someone out there. It'll be at least 45 minutes""

Meanwhile, Matt came online and kept me entertained. I attempted playing Brain Age on my DS but was too frazzled. Eventually, the tow truck driver called me and said he was on his way. A few minutes later, someone coming the other way in a box truck stopped to see if I needed help. They even offered to change the tire for me but I told them AAA would be there in 5. They offered to stay with me until the tow truck got there but I thanked them and told them it wasn't necessary. Then they turned around and headed back the way they came. I think they'd driven passed me a few minutes before and then actually turned around and came back. It was nice that they stopped. A hundred other people drove right passed me and didn't give me a second glance. 

The tow truck driver showed up a few minutes later and was incredibly nice. He had my tire changed before I could even blink. I thanked him for showing up in the middle of the night (it was 1am by this point) even though I didn't know where I was. He pointed to some trees across the street.

""See those trees? Graterford is right on the other side of them""

Ahhh.. it's probably good that I didn't know where I was until after help arrived. lol."

Occasionally, I make time to spend with Matt. I haven't hung out with Keenan or any of my other friends in weeks. I'm burnt out to the point of serious depression. I'm questioning myself and everything else. I'm stressed out about the results of the drug test I just took. I don't know if I'll get this job or what. What happens if I don't? What happens if I do?? Is doing the same job for the competition really going to be any better? I think it will but I talk to people and their first response is ""dear god.. you're going WHERE?? WHY??"" The position I've applied for is one that they can't keep filled for more then a few months. The last one only lasted a week. I've seen plenty of people on that route and they are always miserable. Is it really that bad or do they just hire the wrong people? I would be walking into it eyes wide open. I don't have to establish a relationship with the stores, they all know and adore me. Two of them are on my current route and while the managers are known to be very difficult, they love me and gave the prospective employer rave reviews. The hours may be long and the work may be hard (which is enough to chase away anyone that hasn't worked in the business) they won't be as long and hard as what I've grown accustomed to. 

If i get that call tomorrow and they tell me that my drug test came back positive or even dilute (again) I don't know what I'll do. I can't keep doing this, that's for sure. If they call me to tell me I got the job, coke will get an immediate phone call informing them that I am giving my 2 weeks notice. Maybe i'll even tell them that I'm going to work for the competition. Maybe they'll fire me for that and I'll get a 2 week vacation. Maybe they will get down on their knees and beg me to stay. Not only am I one of their top merches, we're only about half staffed right now. They can't afford to lose anyone else. If i leave, one of the bosses will have to pick up my route. There's just no one left to take it. I will listen to whatever they offer me, but unless they give me weekends off, a company car, a raise, and a promotion, it's just not going to happen."

I guess it's only a little impulsive.. After all, I may have been drunk when I clicked the ""place order"" button, but I DID spend half the day reading reviews and picking out one I liked. And, I also thought it out enough to also order a rack to throw it on top of my car. 

Keenan and I went kayaking on thursday (geeze.. how could you guess?) but we have crappy inflatable kayaks of poor walmart quality. The outing ended when I lost control of mine in a strong current and ran into a submerged tree and the raft deflated. Sure.. I can return it to walmart and get another one.. but geeze.. I really don't want to pop another inflatable raft. That REALLY sucked. Especially the part where we got stranded and had to walk over a mile back to the car. 

Keenan is going to hate me though :P We were both saying that we wanted real kayaks but I actually did it. Ah well.. I may have a mortgage, but I don't have kids to support so I can afford it.

Surprisingly enough, it was a pretty road, lined with trees and marshes. It wasn't quite what I'd expected so close to the city. Hiding behind the trees, I could just barely make out a lake. It was amazingly beautiful but everything was plastered with NO TRESPASSING signs. I looked for it on maps when I got home but there was no sign of it. It faded from my memory until two days ago. 

I was reading the paper the other day and an article mentioned a Bernhart park that had been closed for nearly 10 years due to massive lead contamination from the neighboring battery plant. I drove by the place again yesterday and sure enough, Exide is right down the street and the creek that forms the lake is Bernhart creek. 

It depresses the hell out of me that someplace so beautiful has been contaminated by industrial by-products to the point where it has been closed down. It depresses me even more that no one seems to be doing much about it."

John has been after me as long as I've been with the company. He's one of our sales guys. He's not my boss but I still have to communicate with him and he is a superior. I had one of his routes this past week and it was not pleasant. 

It's not unreasonable for the sales guys to ask us to do something extra. Cut in a new item on the shelf. Reset a small section. Clean the backroom. John will give me long lists of these things to do at each store. He will make up things for me to do with the intention of keeping me out all night. Another note: These are not MY stores. I go in them once every few weeks. I don't mind doing a few things here and there, but Micah (the regular Merch) could just as easily do them and honestly, should. I get no thanks for any of this. ""Why should I THANK you for doing your job? You get paid too much to do it anyway. Stop bitching about having to ACTUALLY do something!"" If I don't do what he wants, I get screamed at. The other day he told me ""I can't wait until we get some more people working for us. That way, they can FINALLY fire you"" Funny isn't it? He thinks I deserve to be fired when I've never even been written up. Funny isn't it? I'm ""their worst merch"" even though my evaluation lists me as one of their best.

At 87, we have 15-20 pallets in their back room at any given time. I worked my ass off in there all week long and friday, I managed to get it down to a mere 5 pallets in the back because I knew there was alot coming in the following day. After I had finished, I went to see the manager and he made me walk the store with him! I asked why. After all, I'd done a great job all week. He told me that John said that I'd been slacking off all week and that he needed to check my work! It was downright humiliating. At least, there was absolutely nothing he could complain about. 

By the time I got to my second to last store, it was 4:30. And John had demanded that I clean out, rearrange and condense everything in their trailer. I called my boss. He told me to just fill the shelves and leave. Micah could do it tomorrow. I was told to spend no more then an hour and a half there. After all, we have a crazy week coming up and he wanted me to go home and get some rest. Of course, John called me to yell at me about it today. 

I had a chat with my boss about him today. He told me he'll take care of it and that he knows that Chuck (john's boss) will have a huge problem with this. My boss said he already had a bone to pick with john over something somewhat related. When I told him ""I think John has crossed a line"". He told me ""I'm sure he has"". I was happy to hear that my boss took what I said to heart and actually believed me. 

We'll see if anything positive comes of this. I'm on one of John's routes again on Tuesday. It's possible he'll just be an even bigger dick to me then before. If he does, I'll be ready. I have a whole list of other people that I could call. I'll just work my way up until he leaves me the fuck alone. 




I have a job interview this upcoming week. It's another job in the supermarket DSD business. I have DSD experience from both sides (as a receiver for a year and a merch for a year and a half) so I'm sure they'll want me. I'll just have to decide which job is better for me.. 

The hours would be about the same but the product itself would be lighter so there would be much less heavy lifting involved. I would have less wear and tear on my car with the new job too. I do adore most of my coworkers (except john) though. We're one great big disfunctional family. Our meetings are the highlight of my week. It's an hour of everyone sitting around hurling insults at each other. However, the other job has *gasp* two other girls working there already! (and one is REALLY hot) both are about my age. Next time I run into either of them, I'll have to ask how they treat their female employees. Also, I'm uncertain what they get paid or if they are union. Clearly, I'm not a big fan of unions. Ah well. My current employer used to be union and if nothing else, now I know how to take those bastards down. Hehehehe."

Apparently, everything will revolve around these things. They have built in GPS so that the company can tell exactly where we are at any given moment. Every evening, they will automatically upload our schedules into them for the following day. We will punch in using the phones and the system will only allow us to punch in in the immediate vicinity of our first stop. Our times spent at each store will be recorded on the phones and they will automatically calculate our mileage and completely eliminate the need for paperwork. We will be sent updates for delivery times and such during the day as well. 

I guess this will make things easier in some ways and supposedly improve communication. However, the thought of people ""spying"" on me through my phone, makes me more then just a little paranoid.

So I went to see Static-X last night. I went with 2 couples and I was miserable. By the time we even got there, I was ready to just slit my wrists and wait in the car for 4 hours. Major anxiety attack. We hung out at the bar for a hour or so and I tried texting a few people but was completely ignored. I felt worse. 

Eventually, I had enough of feeling awkward while everyone around me was kissing and being all nasty. Damn couples. I got up to go to the bathroom. I didn't tell anyone I was leaving. They didn't really give a shit about me up until that point anyway. I do have to admit though, Tiffany was at least nice enough to try to engage me in conversation a few times. That helped. 

After I came out of the bathroom, I decided to just go into the show. At least there, I could just blend into the crowd. As soon as I did, I felt ok. It's sad. I feel more comfortable in a sea of random people then I do with friends. 

It lasted about 2 minutes until jerod and cara found me. Then I felt shitty again and disappeared for the rest of the show. 

I ended up finding a group of random guys to amuse me. It was nice to go from being the outcast of my little group to the center of attention elsewhere. I do have a way with men :) There was some annoying chick in front of us that was bouncing around and had a massive amount of really long blond hair. She kept accidently thwapping people in the face with it. We had loads of fun joking about how fun it would be to set it on fire. Then (while doing her little drunk bouncy dance thing) she accidently hit one of the guys in the nuts. Twas downhill from there. hehe.

Best part of the night was when I met up with jerod and cara afterwards. The look on their faces when I showed up with some random guy on my arm was priceless. I've always told jerod that I'm a huge flirt. I don't think he ever believed me until that moment. 

Random dude left. We were all hanging around outside and some other guy pulled up in a car. He kept trying to talk me into getting in the car with him. HA! Yeah right. I tried to make it worthwhile by asking him for weed.. but it didn't quite work out. 

Anyway, the moral of the story is that it's far better to feel comfortable in your own skin then it is to hide behind slutty clothes and shitloads of makeup. 

Besides, If you do the math, an hour a day in front of a mirror quicky adds up. I'd rather not spend two weeks out of every year doing my hair and putting on makeup. I can think of better uses for my time."

"event","Chiquita to pay $25M in terror case

WASHINGTON - Banana company Chiquita Brands International said Wednesday it has agreed to a $25 million fine after admitting it paid terrorists for protection in a volatile farming region of Colombia.

The settlement resolves a lengthy Justice Department investigation into the company's financial dealings with right-wing paramilitaries and leftist rebels the U.S. government deems terrorist groups.

In court documents filed Wednesday, federal prosecutors said the Cincinnati-based company and several unnamed high-ranking corporate officers paid about $1.7 million between 1997 and 2004 to the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, known as AUC for its Spanish initials.

The AUC has been responsible for some of the worst massacres in Colombia's civil conflict and for a sizable percentage of the country's cocaine exports. The U.S. government designated the right-wing militia a terrorist organization in September 2001.

Prosecutors said the company made the payments in exchange for protection for its workers. In addition to paying the AUC, prosecutors said, Chiquita made payments to the National Liberation Army, or ELN, and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as control of the company's banana-growing area shifted.

Leftist rebels and far-right paramilitaries have fought viciously over Colombia's banana-growing region, though the victims are most often noncombatants. Most companies in the area have extensive security operations to protect employees.

In Colombia, authorities reported Wednesday that nine geologists searching for gold were captured by the FARC. In addition, the army confirmed that four contractors hired by Colombian oil giant Ecopetrol were missing near Colombia's border with Venezuela.

Colombia has one of the highest kidnappings rates in the world. Arrangements between companies and either guerrillas or paramilitaries are not uncommon, but it is impossible to know how much money is paid each year.

""The information filed today is part of a plea agreement, which we view as a reasoned solution to the dilemma the company faced several years ago,"" Chiquita's chief executive, Fernando Aguirre, said in a statement. ""The payments made by the company were always motivated by our good faith concern for the safety of our employees.""

Chiquita sold its Colombian banana operations in June 2004.

Details of the settlement were not included in court documents, but Aguirre said Chiquita would pay $25 million in fines, which it set aside this year. The company reported the deal to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. A plea hearing was scheduled for Monday.

The payments were approved by senior executives at Chiquita, prosecutors wrote in court documents. Prosecutors said Chiquita began paying the right-wing AUC after a meeting in 1997 and disguised the payments in company books.

""No later than in or about September 2000, defendant Chiquita's senior executives knew that the corporation was paying AUC and that the AUC was a violent paramilitary organization,"" prosecutors wrote in Wednesday's court filing.

Company attorneys made it clear the payments were improper, prosecutors said.

""Bottom line: CANNOT MAKE THE PAYMENT,"" the company's outside counsel advised in February 2003, according to an excerpt of a memo included in court documents.

In April 2003, company officials and lawyers approached the Justice Department and told prosecutors they had been making the payments. According to court documents, the payments continued for months.

The document filed by federal prosecutors is known as an information. Unlike an indictment, it is normally worked out through discussions with prosecutors and is followed by a guilty plea."

I bought two dark wood chairs with black leather cushions and matching foot stools for my living room. I was a bit worried that I wouldn't have enough seating in there but it's not like I ever really have company anyway. I figured I could always add a love seat later but honestly, there's not much more room in there! 

I also bought a pair of barstools for the bar downstairs, a side table to go with the chairs in the living room, a few little swirly things for the dining room, bed linens for both bedrooms, and a big awesome swirly black mirror to go above the fireplace. I'm not allowed to spend money for a little while. Heh.

Maybe three feet away, and down at counter level behind my bar, there's a wire that comes out of the wall and plugs into an outlet there. The basement is finished with wood paneling and i guess someone just ran the wire behind the wall and back out again. I am only ASSUMING that this strange little gizmo is attatched to that wire going into the outlet. The same company name is on both things. The wiring going into the plug was badly frayed so I unplugged it. I demand to know what it is!! Oh yeah.

When I got them to the house, I opened them up first to check them out only to find that someone had shoved an extra panel in each one! Yay! Free curtains! I'm not sure what I'll do with them though. I guess I'll either use them in my office or take them back. 

I spent most of the day painting and I still haven't finished my room. It's not a large room but the super textured walls make painting a BITCH. I may have to buy another gallon of paint just to finish it. I guess if you think about it, all the little grooves and ridges double the surface area. I still have one wall to paint and I have to go back around and paint the tops of the walls by the ceiling. I still haven't figured out how the hell to paint behind the radiator. 

Once this painting fiasco is over with, I'm going to have one kick ass bedroom. I went with purple, cream and black. AND I've finally put my dragonfly lights to good use. 

One room (almost) done. Seven more (and a bathroom) to go. 



Oh yeah. I'm still confused about my mailing address. Half my mail says has one town name on it and the other half has another. I'm not sure which is right.  I guess it doesn't really matter. It all gets there. 

EDIT- According to the USPS website, one is the ""Actual city name"" and the other is one of the ""Acceptable city names"". Fascinating."

"event","Well, I requested off the week beginning Jan 13 to move. I hope to get a good amount of the smaller stuff done before hand. Thankfully, moving the big stuff shouldn't be too awful. I've already had a good number of people offer to help me out. The worst part will be deciding what stuff to move and what to get rid of. I still have two personal days left this year. I think I'll take two three day weekends and try to get as much done as I can.

"event","I ran into Jeff (one of my bosses) today at work. He mentioned that he still hasn't made a decision about the home market account manager position. Apparently, he's only received two applications for the position. He's trying to determine if there were other applications that HR never sent him or if the two he has are the only ones. If he doesn't get any more applications, that leaves me with a 50% chance of getting the job. Yay! *crosses fingers*"

"event","Blah. My heater died a week ago. I finally got it fixed on thursday. I asked them if i needed a new one and the guy was like ""nah.. i can fix it"". So I spent close to $400 to get it fixed. Now it's not working again. If I find out that the damn thing is dead and that I need a new one, I will be PISSED. If this is the case, I sure hope they'll be giving me a significant discount (you know, like $400) off the cost of a new one. If not, I'll be finding someone else to do it. Of course, it could be some minor thing that they'll re-fix for free.. *crosses fingers* 'cause I really don't want to have to buy a new heating system a month before I move out."

"event","Well, my insurance is all set up. All I have to do is go sign some papers and write a check in the morning. Moyer got the parts in to fix my heater so I'll finally be able to take a nice long hot shower tonight. 24 hours from now, I'll be getting the keys to my new house. Marybeth is working her butt off trying to fix all of our payroll problems in time to get us our checks by Saturday. I fixed the garbage disposal. 

It seems like I've finally managed to get everything under control. It's been stressful though and by the time I go back to work on Saturday, I'll be ready for a (real) day off. 

I'm still stressed out because I can't help but feel like I've focused on the little things and forgotten something huge."

"event","I'm stressed out. We're short handed at work and everyone is working long hours and lots of overtime. Christmas is coming quickly and with everything that's going on, I've forgotten who I'm supposed to buy a gift for this year. Settlement is approaching quickly and as it does, it seems like the kutztown house is rebelling against me. In the last few days, both the heat and garbage disposal have mysteriously died. I have two months to fix up the new house, move, fix up the old house and get it on the market. Two months may seem like a long time, but when your life consists of working 12-14 hours a day, eating dinner and going to sleep, two months seems insignificant. 

I'm going to take a nap. It's been about a month since I've been able to sleep past 7. Oh right.. there was that holiday thing last week where I got to sleep until 8.. that was nice."

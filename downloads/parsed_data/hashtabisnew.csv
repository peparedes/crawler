"event","I'm really bored just in case you couldn't tell, but I found this quote really funny (its even funnier if you watch the clip of it):

""Hello and welcome to Amsterdam's finest and most luxurious youth hostel. We feature one medium sized room containing 70 beds which can sleep up to 375 bodies a night. There is no bathroom nor is there one nearby. If you do not wish to have your valuables stolen, I suggest destroying them or discarding them right now. You can also try hiding your valuables in your anus. This will deter some, but of course, not all theives. Once you are inside, the doors are chained and locked from the outside. They will not be opened again until the morning, no matter what. Should a fire occur, due to our faulty wiring, or the fireworks factory upstairs, you will be incinerated along with the valuables that you have hidden in your anus. Tips are greatly appreciated.""-Eurotrip"

"event","I finally have internet access on my laptop! now i never have to leave my room. mr. ketchen came over today to set it up on mine and jen's computers but he stayed for dinner at the hickeys. after dinner, ryan, aimee, nick, lynda, and katherine showed up for the pollyanna party. we had to quickly switch the present nick was gonna give maggie because the parents were watching us and wanted to see what we got. nick originally got maggie these penis popsicles and a 24"" blow up penis. we switched it with gift cards that people had on them. i gave aimee her real gift bc i couldnt bring her other gift or i wouldve probably got in trouble for it (it was a shot glass set). I got a sweatshirt, picture frame, and.......tuxedo boxers with matching cuffs and bow tie. nick got the best gift! he got this trophy that used to have this guy holding a tennis racket between his legs but the racket part broke off so it looked like he was jerking off (and he had this creepy smile). it also had ""biggest jerkoff"" ingraved in it. after everyone was done opening their gifts, we all went out to wawa which turned into a trip to KFC and Mcdonalds (but we ended up not getting anything). we later ordered pizza and drove back to the hickey's. by the end of the night, we played truth or dare. katherine had to give lynda a hickey (on her arm), i had to wear my damn tuxedo boxers, ryan had to run down the driveway in boxers, maggie had to run down the driveway topless, and katherine had to straddle me. then it came to the end of the night and the game ended. i left shortly after and am here now. well im gonna go, hope everyone had a merry christmas. later"

"event","I only have to go to one more day of school before winter break officially starts! im trying my hardest to try and stay home.....i dont think its working though. all well. tonight i ate over the hickey's and i realized how much i have in my life that i have to be greatful for. when a person that is supposed to be their child's role model makes the child cry, there is just something wrong. how can someone be that selfish as to tell someone to skip something they love just because he doesnt have the dignity to go and see his own daughter practice (or even attend one of the performances). i am soo greatful that my parents arent divorced, i dont no how i would handle that. on a better note, christmas is in 3 days!! i still have to wrap all my gifts (which is probably what ill do instead of studying for my stupid algebra 2 test). i also should be writing an essay for choir/encores.....if it gets me out of testing, then its worth it! the rest of my day was pretty uneventful so i guess ill go now. later"

"event","School sucked today! in my algebra class, myt teacher gave us an essay on something i knew nothing about so i basically failed that test. in desktop publishing, we overexposed the film and got a bad grade for it. choir and encores was boring (like usual). ms. jeanes was our gym teacher for the day since our teacher wasnt there, and american lit. is getting really boring. ONLY 4 MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL LEFT! after school, i rushed home so that i could get ready so that i could make it back to school by 4. i dont remember the bus ride that well bc i kept on falling asleep and then waking back up. when we finally got to longwood geardens, my foot was asleep and i had trouble walking. first we had this lady with an annoying voice show us where we would perform and then we headed to the cafeteria. after we got done eating...me, meghan, allison, and laura decided to go through the conservatory (thinking that it would be a short walk thorugh) well, it took us 20 minutes to go through the whole thing and we thought that we were gonna be late for the performance. while in there, laura asked one of the lady's working there if there was any way we could leave early. the lady took offense to this and laura tried to convince her that she was enjoying herself, its just that we needed to be somewhere else at the time. well, every damn room looked the same and all the trees had something wrong with them. when we finally made it to the last room, we all ran for the exit door and meghan realized that she didnt have her bow tie. we went back to where the performance was gonna be held and luckily someone found an extra bow tie. the we went back to our trailer where me and alison tried to pronounce the name of the gift store: Catalpa Gifts. i came up with ""cowtaplablah"" and allison came up with ""catablahblahblah."" oh and all the store had was one rack of shirts, coffee, and hats. after acting like idiots and trying to pronounce the damn name of the store, we found out the time and saw that we had 2 minutes before practice started. we made it in time and both performances went well. during the bus ride back, we were ""graced"" with dave kirkenslager (however u spell his name) presence. when we finally got back to the school, we found out that our parents were still driving back so we amused ourselves by pushing allison into a bush and watching her struggle to get up. for the most part, it was a fun night. ok well im gonna go....later"

"event","Today was fun! school went by fast enough, which i think is due to the fact that i got to miss 2nd block because we had to perform the concert for the elementary and middle schools. after school i went home and was yelled at by lynda for ""flirting"" with maggie (which i wasnt!). after i got home, i tried to finish as much homework as possible (which is none) and started getting ready for the performance at the union league. while going there it was boring bc i was really tired and everyone was being loud so i couldnt fall asleep. when we finally got there, it was freezing outside and we had to walk around the building bc the door we were planning on going through was locked. the guys were fine bc they have a coat that goes with they're uniforms but the girls werent too happy. when we got inside, we started walking around the inside of the building and when we made it to the 2nd floor we found a lady that had no idea as to where we should go. we finally decided to just go by the staircase in the middle of the lobby and start to sing. there is one bad part to this story.....dan materazo (aka tits) came along with us to play mideval noel and to sing his o holy night solo. needless to say we ignored him as much as possible. anyway, when we were done singing, we were told that once all the guests made it upstairs then we could help ourselfs to the buffet tables. well at this point we were starving and were basically huldded around the tables ready for any signal that would mean we could start eating. allison got to a point where she was soo thirsty that she got dan rheur (or however u spell his name) to grab ice off of the ice sculptor just so she could drink it. soon after that john schmitt came over to me and said if he grabbed a roll, would i be willing to split it with him. i of course took up that offer but ended up having to have to share with megan mcdermott. the funny part is john took the role just as mr dietzler turned around and was looking right at him. after that, a guy came up to us and told us that we could start. buffet tables + 32 hungary teenagers = chaos. it was surprising though bc they actually had ""teenager food"" such as fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and macaroni and cheese. when i was done getting my food, i sat at a table with dan r., john schmitt, allison and a bunch of other people. soon sherry came over to our table and we (dan, john and me) decided that her role represented a penis. john then tells her that she better eat her role be4 dessert starts and she replied with a disappointing answer of something about not wanting it. dan then took it and placed it on his plate, right inbetween too pieces of meat. all we needed then was for benglian to walk over and see a penis shaped meal on dan's plate but that never happened. soon people were adding things to the penis shaped roll, such as mashed potatoes, to give it that ""authentic"" look. later, while allison was drinking her water, dan decided to see if he could make her spit it out. he decided that saying nocturnal emissions (mind u this is in a very classy dining hall) and allison, sure enough, spit out her water. then we all joined in on the game and whenever allison would go to drink something, we would say something. i decided to say vaginal secretions. it worked! then we later found out that bridget was horribly scared of raisins?! so, being the nice people we are, we threw raisins at her and she started flipping out bc she once ate a fly that some1 told her was a raisin or something like that and thats y shes scared of them. ya....weird. after that, dan decided that he was gonna keep the penis shaped roll as a sovenir and he put it in his pocket. then john schmitt said something like ""hey, theres corn in my water"" and dan replied with ""well theres a penis in my pocket and u dont hear me complaining.""(yet again this is in a classy dining hall)  after we were done eating and get up to leave, we walked back outside in the freezing cold and made it back to the street the bus was on, the only problem was that we were on the opposite side of the street. of all the streets for the bus to park on, it had to go and park on the busiest street. soon, everyone was yelling to cross but then other people were yelling not to bc a huge bus would come by or something stupid like that and all i was waiting for was to read in the newspaper ""encores singers, crushed by bus yesterday."" after there was finally a break in the cars, we all made a run for it (all 32 of us) and by that time we had caused soo much attention to ourselves from yelling the entire time, that everyone on the streets was watching all of us sprint across the street and scramble into the bus. needless to say, if the rest of the trips this week are as fun as this one then ill be happy :) the holy comforter performance is tomorrow though.....i dont no how much fun u can have at a church, but i think well manage! ok well im gonna go now and finally be happy that i had an awesome day! later"

"event","Im really bored! saturday was our 3rd indoor practice and we got to meet our visual tech. aka king of the marching nazi's! we started marching at like 220 (for non-band people, that means really fast) and he kept on making us do the same thing over and over again. then he gave us this packet on how to march....really, it doesnt take that much to march. afterwards, i went home and decided not to go to the movies with my friends bc i wasnt feeling good....and im still regretting that choice (although i heard i wouldnt have liked going bc tj was there). sunday i basically sat around the house and did nothing and was not in a good mood. someone changed that for me though.....its amazing what a 3 hour phone conversation can do for u! thanks (u no who u r). i woke up the next morning actually happy (and that never happens) but i woke up late, again, and missed my ride. school actually went by fast, for once, and i got home only to go to my room and fall asleep till dinner. someone woke me up (i still cant remember who) and i ate dinner and then went straight up to bed again. later i came on the computer and finally realized what it was like to try and comfort someone that just didnt want to be in their house anymore. im realizing, as days go by, thats its gonna be really hard when certain people go to college....who m i gonna see on the weekends? whose house m i gonna be able to go over just so i can sit on a bench and be comforted? o and speaking of college........either WCU, IUP, or somewhere really far, like hawaii! im still deciding. itll probably be down to how im feeling next year....if i feel like being really far away then ill probably chose an out of state college or IUP. if i feel like being close to home then ill probably go to WCU. all the colleges have their ups and downs so if anyone has anything that would help me make my decision easier, i would greatly appreciate it. ok well thats all for now. hopefully ill be able to have another 3 hour conversation tonight again :] later"

"event","The past couple of days are pretty much a big blur. Friday was homecoming and the band had to perform during it (they couldnt find another way to ""appreciate"" us?!). i stayed for the skits which i think the juniors shouoldve won since the only good part of the seniors was when tyrek danced (hes the only good one). all well, i stayed after for the dance and the entire time maggie and katherine and lynda were trying to get me to dance (tall white boy= no dancing). after the dance, me maggie aimee ryan and nick went to ryans. it was a usual night (hang out, pick on maggie, etc.). the next day was thanksgiving and i got to wake up at 8 bc i had to be at school for the last band practice of the season!!!! the practice went fine and the senior class was, hmmmm how should i word this.....pathetic. well there was only 10 of them so u couldnt expect much. i did find some interesting information on some1 that likes me (and that some1 still thinks that I like some1). the football game was like any other (long and boring) and the fact that we did a stand still is bull. all well, i got to leave early bc i was going down the shore for thanksgiving (i have never stayed for an entire thinksgiving day game) and i laughed as i passed every1. what can i say, im an ass. after getting down the shore, i ate and watched tv. thats it....pretty boring! when i got home, i talked to people online and went to bed. i actually went to bed be4 1am, how amazing. after i woke up today, i was greeted with my mom telling me that my room needed to be cleaned (big shock) and we were all told that the house needed to be cleaned since every1 is coming over tomorrow for the Steve/Angela Party! o, if ur reading this then ur invited to come (so dont say that i didnt invite u!). ok well i gotta go clean the house (u no u wanna come over and clean for me!) later."

So, now that thats done......time to talk about today. school sucked (whats new?!). i got home and went on the computer and thats all i did all day. Its friday and i didnt even leave me house. how sad! all well....now i have maggies b-day party tomorrow and have to get the pollyanna set up...thats all u aimee! well im gonna go to bed now....my eyes hurt. later"

"event","Today was a very long day and its only going to get longer. I woke up to the wonderful noise of my dad (i didnt hear my alarm go off....again) and i quickly hurried in the shower and got ready as soon as possible. i got to school and completely fell asleep for first block. during second block i went on the internet (i have desktop publishing during 2nd block) and completely missed the lecture on how to make business cards (but i did find out that brass only lost by .3). in third block i was reminded that i have the middle states dinner tomorrow and i completely forgot about it. fourth block was health and all i can say is that health should be a leveled class. fifth block (like first block) was me sleeping and completely not noing what the story was about that we read in class today (o and my teacher decided to start huck finn and now we have to have up to page 80 read by monday....ya right). and to top off my school day, i never went to the grad. project guy to find info on places i can do community service at and, like always, ill probably procrastinate till the end of the week. for some reason, i dont no why, but ive always been this kid that always did well in school and i dont mean pulling off an 80 in all my classes. i used to take pride in the fact that i would get the highest grade in my class (which isnt saying much since all my classes are level 1) but it seems like now i could care less about school and all the work involved with it. take for instance....right now it is a little past 2 in the morning. i still have to complete about 30 problems for algebra (on stuff i dont know about b/c i fell asleep in class) do a section review and vocab for health (which i no ill leave till the morning) and start reading huck finn (which i wont do at all and probably just look up info on sparknotes about it). i dont get it...its not that i like school but it never bothered me this way. maybe its just a phase.....hopefully. well to get back to my day, i got home from school and absolutely ecstatic when i was yelled at for not having my room clean. my parents still go on with this thing about grounding me.....IDK ANYMORE! GROUND ME!!! THEN ILL FINALLY BE LEFT ALONE AND WONT GET YELLED AT! but i ended up ""cleaning my room"" (aka hide everything so the room looks nice) and by tomorrow it will look exactly like it did today. when i went on the computer, i think it was the first time i smiled (and not a fake one). its when i can talk to people without having them be right there in front of u as u try to explain whats wrong. i, as some of u probably no, am not very good at expressing myself in person (hence why i have a livejournal) and basically hate when people baggar me about ""whats wrong?"" if i wanted to tell u, i would.....its as simple as that. im not trying to be mean but im just not good at expressing myself face to face. i have come to the conclusion that i must a computer of my own. one computer for 5 people is definetly not enough. here is what my christmas list consists of: money, clothes, laptop.....thats it. and i can almost 99.99999999% guarantee that i wont get the laptop. all well, ill get over it and probably get one during my freshman year of college. speaking of college, i now have 6 choices: IUP, WCU, ESU, Millersville, Bllomsberg, and Shippingsburg. its kinda a hard decision since all of them have their PROS and CONS. well, its gettting late and i should start my homework (ill probably go to sleep instead). i would just like to thank someone though for something that really made my night. aimee, thank you soo much for what you wrote. i came back downstairs and saw that someone wrote me something while i was away and your message is probably the thing that made my night. thanks. later"

We practiced and had a good run-through and then loaded all the equipment to get ready for the best (to date) ACC's performance Upper Darby has ever had. We arrived at the stadium and immediately started basics block (in front of s. regional and carlisle) and we looked amazing. we played in double arc after that and everything went smoothly. Soon it was time and we were all marching onto the field (thank god for astro-turf) and i can remember hearing the crowd yelling ""U-P-P-E-R D-A-R-B-Y."" The show went amazing (of course) and even though we had some slips and falls (and wind during the ballad) we knew that that show was a great way to end the season. after getting our picture taken we sat in the stands waiting for awards to start. finally they began.....""in 20th place""....""in 10th place""....""in 4th place""....and finally ""in 2nd place, with a score of 96.40, winning the high visual, high auxilary, and high percussion captions, UPPER DARBY."" we had finally broken the UD curse! we finally mad it into the top 3, we finally got high guard, and to top it all off we only lost to southern regional by .05 (they got a 96.45). the funny part is that s. regionals score went down from chapters and our went up! that tells u something about Upper Darby. I cant wait till next year! after we got back home, a bunch of people went to perkins and afterwards people went over ryans. i dont no how i couldve ended the day any better than having finally broken ""the curse"" and then spending my day with my friends. today was amazing! later"

Im sooooo excited for it...this has been the most amazing year UD has ever had and its only gonna get better!

Even though i had to perform at the vet's day parade in media, my day was still fun. we marched up the streets and only had to play twice (three times if u count when we played the closer). the only bad part was when we passed the HUGE dog that started barking at us (and there is no way in the hell little lady wouldve been able to hold him back!), if it chased us, we wouldve all been dead. its all good though b/c we could always sacrifice nate blithe! after the parade, i went home and got ready to go to the mall. I must say that when ur really tired, everything seems to be really boring. when i got home from the mall, i went online and won monopoly again (YOU WILL NEVER BEATN ME AT THAT GAME) but i lost to battleship, but that was after i won in sorry and scrabble. Did u no that Yen and Lin are words.....lol, but Len isn't, lol. Then aimee and brendan started trying to convince me that i like maggie but i got them back. HAHAHAHA PAYBACKS A BITCH! then to get brendan back even more, me and ang convinced him that she got her nipples pierced at the mall today. he believed us at first, but me being my nice self (yes thats right, im nice) told him it was a joke. thank god tomorrow's friday! and just to remind people.....dinner at my house after practice tomorrow (unless i hate u). well, i should be getting to bed soon (who m i kidding, im gonna be up till at least 1) all well. later

I woke up (late, of course) and got to school. i forgot to find information on community service options (like i said i would) and now ill have to see my grad project coach friday, which ill probably forget to do again. The algebra test today seemed pretty easy, which means i might have actually passed it! After school i walked home, by myself (thanks a lot maggie and lynda....j/k) and got home to find that i had no food in my house. how disappointing!!! then i went to my last ""real"" practice for band today and needless to say, it was ""interesting."" As i was talking to angela in the band room, barb and dan devlin thought it would be funny to put my mouthpiece in a condom.....i didnt find it funny, go figure. so, i decided to take dan's mouthpiece and make him use mine....hey, he had it coming. plus, him and barb should be happy that I didnt soak them! but i feel bad for dugan. barb and dan decided to try and get me back again by putting the condom in my water cooler, thinking i was going to drink the water. I was never planning on drinking the water though (it was meant to soak them with) but dugan asked to drink some, and me not knowing about the condom in the water, let him have some. well, he threw up after finding out about what was hidden in the water and i got wet by meg when she found out that i wet her with water that had a condom in it. Now the condom can be found in the hegdehog/rodent hole (whatever the hell the things r called that live on UDHS grounds). the goods news is that we had a great run through by the end of the night, meaning that im still stuck on the decision that we have a HUGE chance of winning ACC's this year. I finally found one of those message boards today, that the directors and staff are always talking about, and a lot of people think we have the best percussion and guard so we better be at least getting those captions this year. As long as we place in the top 3 (hopefully the top 2....were better than carlisle) i'll be happy. at least theres no school tomorrow!!!!! but now we have to perform in the parade but i guess its better to have to wake up at 9 am rather than 6:30 am. O and if u are reading this then u r probably one of my close friends so consider yourself invited to my house, after band practice, on friday. just make sure u tell me that your coming (so that we have enough food, drinks, etc.). well i guess ill go to bed now.....considering that its past 2 am right now. o and by the way....I AM STILL THE MONOPOLY CHAMP!!!!

Now the reason for the lock down is to prevent things like columbine from happening and other things like that. well if i student plans on attacking the school, wont they no about what the lock down is, therefore completely defeating the purpose of it. all well, at least i got to miss some of health class. oh and also found out about 2 people that are gonna be getting kicked out of choir. even better news is that i hate both of them! when i got home, i got yelled at for not cleaning my room (whats new?) and now im gonna have to clean the house on thursday because people are coming over friday. im not complaining about the people coming over, its just that i dont wanna clean. what can i say, im lazy. And im am NOT going to decide whos sits with me on the ACC's bus.....u people can fight over that. all i can say it that whatever ur choice is, make sure it doesnt involve any drama (who wouldve thought....chris not have drama in his life, No Way!!!!) speaking of ACC's, practice better be damn good tomorrow, considering that its our last ""real"" practice. Ive already decided that im gonna yell at any1 that talks (yes i no, im an asshole, but i wanna win and this year we actually have a chance!) as excited i m for how amazing this outdoor season has gone, i cant wait till indoor. i was watching last years WGI finals (i no, i no.....im a loser) and we are definetly better than some of those bands so we should definetly have a good indoor season this year. im a little disappointed though b/c i didnt get to talk with someone tonight.......;) u no what green m&m's do to u! ok well i guess i better ""study."" later"

I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

Yeah
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain

Try so hard to say goodbye

"event","Today was an ok day. i woke up at 6:00 and forgot to hit the snoze button when my alarm went off and i almost missed my ride to school. At school, my algebra teacher decided that he is gonna give us a test on wednesday on all the stuff i dont know. Health was rediculous. We had some guest speaker (a girl, mind you) who talked about how we shouldnt have sex....in other words, she is a penis hater! The good news is that i dont have any homework. When i got home, i went to bed and woke up later than usual and thought i was gonna be late for band. Band was AWESOME tonight!!!!!!! i never thought i would say that. We started off practice with cleaning some sets and then doing a run through. the run through sucked but the trumpets got yelled at (its about time) for talking the entire night, and the best part about it is nate blithe was singled out! i have no idea on how he has survived 4 years of marching band. So ive still decided that we still have a chance of pulling off first at ACC's. Southern Regional may be good, but were better. Our show is cooler. I still cant get the fact out of my head that we could actualy be the first people in the marching royals to place 1st at ACC's. And now we might be getting new uniforms next year (thanks to the school district). My senior year might actually be fun...oh wait, no it wont, i go to upper darby high school. I cant wait till college though. ive narrowed it down to 5 colleges: west chester, IUP, east strousburg, millersville, and bloomsberg. its all gonna come down to which one i can afford. well thats my day (ya i no, pretty boring). later"

"event","Today was pretty uneventful. I woke up at 11 am and couldnt fall back asleep (how disappointing). But there is some bitter-sweet news.....we're in 2nd place for TOB. Southern Regional is beating us but now we have something to work for this week. The scary part is that we actually have a chance of actually winning. How amazing would that be? ""...and in 1st place...."" At least this year we'll definetly be getting a medal, and thats cool enough in itself. I cant believe that im actually saying this but i cant wait till next year! But thank god indoor will be starting up by the end of this month. I cant wait....we have the best drumline Upper Darby has ever had, and this year we have a drill writer so now the judges cant say that our drill is too simple. Even though last years cymbal line was probably (and will always) be my favorite year, im sure this year will be fun too. And we also have a chance of winning indoor b/c this year bensalem isnt a world class drumline. How incradible would it be if we won outdoor and then won indoor?! The only thing that annoys me is that this year the people in marching band arent as good as people in previous years and yet this is the year we could win it all. all well......o and one more thing. I am definetly the king of monopoly. With a record of 3-0, would could deny it!!! later."

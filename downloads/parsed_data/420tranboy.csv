"event","this is the most beautiful morning because i woke up with a beautiful lady i met at a friends last week. there must be a god in heaven beecause i have what i sought. i was never expecting to. I met up with jonny about 11:30 this morning, having gotten up at 6 with my new love and got dressed and now we are planning on driving to Calgary. So I ordered breakfast with my beer while I waited for him. i am using his laptop at the resturant.

NEW SONG: smokin the morn away/ oh if we could stay/ here foreverrrr./you can be there when i rize/ with you my heart got better/ love me foreverrrr.

someday,someday,you with me we will find the way....
someday someday there will no more lonely nights, no more former battles to fight...
i found you for everrrrrrr. i will love you foreverrr,we will love togetherrrrr....

About 5 pints more my friends will have to come and picked me up and poured me into the truck. Several errands (I forgot to get 'American III' at 'A&B Sound'! Dammit. Stupid beer.) later when we go home Casey and I will go see the new members of the s.goddogs...new name for band... fell asleep in the truck last night and I will need to crawl back into bed soon if the day goes as such and sleep to 10 then i meet sharyn in PM.

Basically, if I can remembered to buy the new stings, it will be a perfect day. Beer. Nappage.

I finally broke down and bought myself the new bike to work on, and still have only the one fork to work on.  But I like it hugely. This is the original engine, so I had a little work to do. I'm proud of myself.

I knew reading those guys who found girls would help"

.
i slept. much needed sleep for my body, but my mind won't stop questioning everything and anything that comes to it. i want peace in my life, but it feels as if i'm too young to ask for such a thing or to old to have it. peace brings about boredom and boredom shouldn't be apart of a young man's life. Yes, I am a young man acording to my inner feelings and now i am so in look, acording to what people tell me i am or what i should be, but i am not. i am a child at heart and i don't want to let that go. i believe its because of this, my mind is not at ease. i want peace, but i deal with responcibilities that a true child would never be allowed to have.

my mind is numb with thought body, aching from stress...my life has become that of a man with a soul as if i worked a 9 to 5 job. i need relese from this body. i need someone to take me away from this place. pysically mentally spiritualy...any form of escape would be nice. i need you right now and i wish you would be the one to take me to a place where love is not an idea, but reality and truth.

My sentiments are simply a concept that needs to be explored. But I found myself writing . I was interested in the things about gender you can't quite fit under your thumb. There's three parts to it.

Men and Women>>>>>>>>>I'm going to give you the choice I never had. ;)
a) sometimes to have a body, to be human, is frightening
b) what is femininity? masculinity? eh? I really don't know
c) how women and men see themselves through the eyes of the other sex, or actually believe this to be true

im not going to practice today because i dont feel like being bored out of my cranial cap. i think i'm going to drop it and look seriously into getting another band together."

"event","the past two days have been  content days. content days are good. they passed by pretty quickly.. thank God. it looks like rain outside today and i can't wait until it all just pours down. i'm getting sick. i hate it. i've been feeling sick for a while now. i ache. booo ho ho ho. need a blunt...this is no good. hurts to smoke..definately no good. my Bday is in 4 days and I cant wait to celibrate it as a man. rebirth. now all i want for the big day is a hot f*ck and love all night long.....:>)

i think i'm making this journal my main one. i have no friends on lj, so i'm pretty much just typing to myself, but that's okay. it's better than babbling about it to people when we both know they don't care. my poor friends.. they put up with so much. complaneing, whinning, excitement, crying, nervosness.. everything. well, now i think i'll just lay it all out on my journal. ..this way, if you're reading, it's not like i put anything on you.... if i say something someone doesn't like, they can just cease to read. that works for me. anyway, my life has been pretty stressful lately."

"event","i feel like ive found home.  its been really lonely here.. there's nothing like a bar full of beautiful straight women who think you're a dyke.  no sense in trying to get their number.  i stood at the bar on the corner decked out.  i mean for real.  for twenty minutes until some guy asked me if ""he'd"" stood me up.  then he laughed at me and some other guy cordially reminded me that there were a couple of dyke bars down the street.

now it's all in the past.  im gonna be passing now and there's no going back.  its almost like a miracle. AND im going to grow this mustache if it kills me.   

This will be the record of my life as a Man.

"event","Well this weekend/last week was Ohkay...
The week sucked because of school. Oh and the fact that I just found out the person I brok up with Trevor for made out with my old best friend. And she's not even good-looking..oh well he's still SEXY
The weekend was okay. I got to babysit this little girl named Carly...she's SO cute!! But she was sick so me and Gwen were walking around the house I was holding her singing..I noe how lame...and Gwen was dancing...even worse. Although it helped and she stoped crying. And I got to see my horseys and ride with Gwen and Ryan. I noe I noe that's all I talk about but riding my horse is the biggest thing I do. Well he looks so pretty now because I got tack for him. Man I had to have a ""family meeting"" last night. Pretty boring!! Well Josh got in trouble. Me and Gwen didn't but I wont get into detale on that one. But it was a ruff night because my mom was like ""why dont you ever go outside? You dont have any friends. You need to get some and you need to go outside more or you cant go on your  computer."" Gosh I thought she was on my side about the friend thing. Because I really dont have any friends. But that's not my problem. It's her's. She made us move just so she could be happy. And all the kids here are like high-school and pot-heads. Well that's bout it. I'm gunna go chat online and then do the homework and go to bed!!
 Later lozers...

"event","Hey yall,
I'm really bored. This is what I did today...

Homeroom: Went to the library as always. That was kinda boring though. Hey Courtney why dont you come with us anymore to the library??

1st: Well spanish was okay today, Cept the fact Ray and Carlos wouldn't let me do my work...they kept talking to me and wouldn't shut up!! Lol It's all good though. But I learned how to do that lil ganster hangshake...it's confoozing!!

2nd: Science, well what can I say boring as always. We got new lab groups today... my group is Me, Marco, Courtney, and Nick. We did this lab called ""incline to roll"". It was really gay our group didn't get to finish because we were playing with our little cars!!

3rd: P.e, Nothing good about that class, you change your clothes and go swett for an hour...i think it's an hour. I'm not sure though. But Me, Morgan, Natalia, and Bianca were playing 4-square. It was boring and this person I dont like was with us, I didn't put her name because of that, so me and Natalia went and ""play'd"" basketball, well we really were just talking to people. OMG!! Dillon told off our coach it was so funny she's like ""Dillon did I say you could go get a drink, No! I said to stay where you were. That's your job so stay there."" and he said ""well you need to go do your job and just leave me the fu, leave me alone"" and she said "" go ahead say it your already getting a referal""  ""why am I getting a referal? For getting a drink?"" ""No I told you to stay put while I'm teaching a class"" ""P.e isn't a class! You dont do anything except give out referals."" It was so funny. You had to be there. That's not all they said but it would take too long!!

4th: Lang. arts is always BORING!! Me and Javon were giving eachother answers to the work so we could get done faster. That's pretty much all we did in that class....

5th: Math, How boring?? We checked home work, took notes on 2 chapters, and then the bell rang. So that's bout it.

6th: Man geography bores me!! Just like all my other classes. All we did was a wordsearch!! Then go to our lockers and then the bell rang!!

Then I went to my bus, stood there till the busdriver came then go on, sat down and did some of my home work!! Then I got off the bus.

Well I'm gunna go take my monthly shower, LoL jp jp...I take one every night!! I'm a CLEAN girl!!
 
                           lol!!! <33Hannah Baby!!"

Homeroom: Boring..went to the library and hung out with Trenika and Trevor.


1st (spanish): Boring too. Some dude in my class was bugging me he's really annoying. And I was talking to Carlos, Morgan, and Bianca. REALLY BORING!! L0L

2nd (Science & Lunch): Really boring! I have like no friends. At lunch I sit with Heather, Ashlee, and Gwen. Me and gwen shared food today b/c it cost's money and me and her are trying to profit off of my mom's money..lol! And in science we took this gay quiz. It's was kinda hard so i'm re-taking it tomorrow..God it's so gay!!

3rd (P.E): God my worst class. But I actually have friends in that class!! Yay! Well Morgan, Bianca, Natalia, Carissa, and me were playing 4-square and pac man. That was boring too. It was hot at P.E. too!!

4th (Lang. Arts): My second worst class. Mr.Gandhi is SO gay. All we did was read this gay story. God lang.  arts is like the class I do other work in b/c it's so boring.

5th (math): Math used to be fun. Till' I got this teacher!! All we did was take a pop-quiz and go over some section. I did my home work and the quiz..I cheated on the quiz..oooo bad Nana!!L0L. 

6th (geography the last class!!): We took a chapter test today. It was so easy except for the writting part. That class all we do is 1 day we go over a section then the next day we take a quiz on it and the next day start another chapter and it just goes on, and on, and on. Until we get to the end of the chapter then we take a chapter test. It's really gay. 

Wow seems like all day I was taking quizes or doing nothing. That's what I do ever fucking day. How boring!! Lol well I gtg I'll update later... Much love to those who make my life worth living!!

"event","Hey this is what I did this weekend..
Friday-Went to school what a bore!! plus I found out how many fucking people can lie and make things up like that they are your friend but then they really arn't and are just pretending to steal ur sisters boyfriend for her so called ""bestfriend""!! Well that night I went to my daddy's house. Not really boring but not really fun. But I guess it was okay. Then I went to bed!!

Saturday-I slept in real late. Me and gwen were like doing this thingy to see who could jump on a pogo stick the longest. Wow great fun...lol!! But then we got in a fight like we always do when we try to hang out. Then we all ate. Then we went out to the barn for a speed show. It was okay I guess besides ryan and carly getting in a fight for no good reasons. But me and Carly went and got my horsey and groomed him. It was fun. And when we put him up She left a rubber band in his tail because she was holding the parts that she already brushed. And then they had to go chase him before a horse went and ripped it out of his tail along with some of his tail. Poor horsey got chased! l0l. Then we went home and went to bed because it was somewhere around 12:30 When we got home.

Sunday-I slept in real late again. Till like 12:30ish. Then when I woke up I took a shower. Then I ate lunch. Then we went out to the barn to tape all of our horses. Oh and I got to ride my ass (donkey) for the first time...she's so awesome but she wont move. Or stay away from lisa's horse (molly[my step-mom's horse]) But it was cool. Then me and stacy were feeding the horses in the front barn. I got hay all over me in my eyes down my shirt. It was fun though. Then me ryan gwen brittany and kasie went on brittanys trampoline. That was fun. I fell off into this bush because we were playing dead man. And I got all this itchy stuff on me. It still itches. Then we went home. Then I came to this home and now I'm writting this.

Well I just wanna know one thing. From hailey and courtney. If yall are my friends or not. I'm pretty sure haileys not. But I dont know about courtney. you both seem like your useing me to get to gwen to get to grant. So if you are comment and tell me. If you arn't comment and tell me why not. Okay well you guys I'm gunna go do somefin better than this I love all my ""sisters and brothers"" loves!!

"event","Oh my gosh! Today was so boring. I woke up around 9:00 and I regret it so much. All day today I sat around my house,watched T.V., jumped on my trampoline, got online. And that's about fucking it! Because my fucking mom wont let me do any thing none of my friends can come over because my step-brother and step-sister are here this weekend. Gosh it fucking sucks! Hopefully tomorrow I can talk my mom into letting me go to Ryan's house or her comming over here. The only people other than my family I've hung out with this weekend are Josh's friends (my brother). Well yeah i'm going to go do the same thing I've been doing all day. Bye yall Love much     *Anna*"

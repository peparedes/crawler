Unplug the TV and turn off the phone,
Get heavy on with digging your ditch,
Where all these troubles weigh down on me will rise,
Where all these worries wear down on me will rise...""

So I'm feeling a little weighed down - I'm not really sure by what, but it feels like it.  I finally feel like I'm doing something somewhat productive - the family is coming out and I've been cleaning like a fiend and in some odd way that's really satisfying to me, but then, I keep waking up in the middle of the night with this feeling - where my chest gets tight and my mind is racing and I'm thinking to myself ""I can't handle this...""  See, I just don't know exactly what it is I can't handle.  Part of me still clings to the life I had before everything changed - it sounds so screwed up because I wanted to get away from that, I was running from that, but my life made sense then, my life had some kind of direction.  I feel like I'm just digging this hole in my life that I'm never going to be able to find a way out of.  see, this is why I'm in therapy - I can't even handle my own thoughts.  Maybe being blonde doesn't help that.  Speaking of which, go see Legally Blonde 2 - it's gonna be a classic, I can feel it =0)

My life is....frustrating.  Just, the only thing that's frustrating is me.  How in the world do you fix that? Or do you just...not?

Pauly's staying here tonight, that'll be good. Mike was mad at me...not anymore.

that's all for now..."

"event","why is it that when you love someone, you're willing to excuse even the most inexcusable behavior?  it's like, the actions that you most often wouldn't tolerate, in fact that would piss you off beyond words, suddenly seem not to matter that much.  whatever feelings you have for that person mask whatever faults they have.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I think that love just does that - it makes someone's faults almost invisible.  but here's my problem - is that love or is that infatuation? and if it's either of those, is that healthy? is that sane? is it normal to put your own moral standards on hold simply because your heart is pulling you in a different direction?

at the moment, I'm starting to feel like whatever infatuation I have is blending with the love I have for someone, and it's clouding my better judgment.  Whenever I talk to them, whenever I think to myself ""ok, this is it - I'm bringing this up,"" some part of me holds back and keeps my mouth shut {something I think all of you know is NOT like me in the least}  but now, I have only myself to blame for the fact that I'm worried about our relationship - about both of our intentions, about the sincerity of our feelings, and about whether or not we're really as great of a match as I thought we were.  I'd like to think that the fact I'm questioning this is a good thing - I usually just didn't care about that kind of thing because if it felt right at the moment, I did it.  Maybe this means I really care about this guy, that I'm concerned about all of this because this time I really truly do want it to last.  Or maybe this is intuition, and I'm a dumbass for ignoring it.

I'm so lost....thoughts?"

"event","I love this book =0) That and ""Southern Women"" - life doesn't get much better than that.

Mama just called - I officially have about a thousand chores to finish up in the next two hours, not to mention shower and run about 6 loads of laundry...what is my life?  oh well, I'm gonna throw on some Kelly Clarkson {my heroin} and clean away.  Plus my plants need some water...they are just wilting away - I'm a terrible mother to them.  Ok, my motivation just kicked in, so I'm gonna take advantage of it while I can.

Eat some ice cream...Mint Chip...life will be much better after that =0)"

"event","you know, I've noticed that I'm always incredibly bad at writing in these things...I always start with one thought and end up making no sense to myself about five lines down the page.  I remember I used to go back a reread what I would write in my journal, and I'd either get hella depressed cuz my life was just not so peachy at that time, or I'd think to myself ""when did my IQ drop, like, 40 points?""  so you see, there's a very large range of emotions that come with me writing in a journal...psshh! thanks a lot Lexie. {just kiddin'}  I suppose, however, that this is just better because at least my hands don't hurt as much as when I actually have to write with a pen - see, us ""homeschoolers"" forget how to actually communicate in the written form...it's not pretty when we do.  see, this whole paragraph is an example of just how random these entries become...I MUST figure out how to keep my thoughts organized.

speaking of which, I'm starting to read yet another self-help book - you gotta love 'em - called ""Life Strategies for Teens.""  Y'all have heard of Dr. Phil from Oprah I'm sure...sadly, yes, I love Dr. Phil...anyway, this one is written by his son Jay McGraw who - DIBS!!!!! - is such a cutie and to top it off he's from Texas, accent and all...woohoo!  anyway, I've actually read this one before and I really like it...so, I'm readin' it again.  I'll keep you posted as I progress through this one...you can all apply the ""Ten Life Laws"" in your own lives and then thank me when it changes dramatically...haha, I can hope, right?

side note - acupuncture rocks my world! suzy-girl had it done yesterday and is startin' to think it actually worked so I'm definitely considering giving this and massage therapy a run for it's money...yay for alternative medicine!  I've gotta buy a book on that. On a second side note, there's this band in my area that has a song called ""Bye Polar"" - it's giving ""Lithium Sunset"" a run for it's money as my official theme song.

I'm hungry....quesadillas, anyone?"

"event","Aye this is some straight ill type of shit that is off the wall.I mean I try to be nice to people and people turn into some straight bitches.i mean I cant help it that i say was on my mind whether its good or bad.If you didnt want to know the truth you shouldnt ask.So here go the scenarios.1)My best friend is a complete fool,she lets her baby daddy walk all over here, nad i keep telling her she doesnt have to take it, but than she turns aroun and blows up in my face.So than I decided to not say shit,but than she tells me about how she found out he been lying about where he been for a minute,and she sits there and asks me what i think,so i told her.So than she gets a attitude so I hang up.And for the last couple of days she has been straight illing so last night we got into it for the final time and i finally said i dont need this you need to go,so that was the end of her.2)My homie is a complete fool ok he has one child as it is and so i told him aye you need to chill with all these femlaes and shyt or else you are going to get caught up.Guess what he does,laugh in my fuckin face,now he has one on the way and another one pending,but yet he is blaming this shyt on me.Hmmmmm, so i let his ass drop too.3)My momma has this boyfriend of hers that is a complete asshole and every since they than got ""close""he thinks he runs shit.So one day I had my mom to come and get me from work and she brings his ass along.So i dont even get in the car good and he starts bitching""you cant say hi,you cant speak to no one, if thats the case get one of ya lil friends to fuckin pick you up""(STRIKE 1).Than we go home and he starts bitching about the damn refrigerator and says""i know everyone in this house has at least 3.0 gpas so why is the refigerator so packed and shit(STRIKE 2).Than he comes in at 9 in the morning and starts complaining and shit like its his house(STRIKE 3).Im sorry but my momma let this nigga walk all over him and i got tired of it so i blew up in his face and told him the truth.Now his on my hitlist.4)This girl that i was hella cool with is a little off the wall.She use to let her ex boyfriend beat the shit out of her and make her have a miscarriage and send her to the hospital and than she lets everyone run over her.i tried to be her friend i was there when she neede it and everything.This is how everything went downhill:One night she called at like 4 in the morning and i had to be at school @ 8.i told her i was tired and ill talk to her when i get out.She than goes off the wall and talks about suicide and shit and hangs up.I didnt her from her until tonight and she talks about her suicide attempts failed and she wants me to be her friend again.I was like bitch you crasy and im done with you.There is mroe alot more but yea my head and hands hurt from all this typig and drama so ill add more later right now i am going to watch cartoon network."

Hey people Im back well for the moment.In a day or two i will be disappearing an its for a number of reasons.1st my life is in shambles right now:money problems,job,school,relationships,friendships they all going down so I need to get this shyt in order.i have ben so stressed in the last few days its a shame.First my ex(that I gave my soul 2)wants me to be her daughters godfather and Im thinking what type of shyt is this.Then my bank messes my money up so i owe everyone money(crying I cant eat).A girl i had my heart on has seemed to dip away from me.My family is on loose ends because everyone is fighting everyone.i dont have no money to go to school.My car broke completely and I am failing in my summer classses.I havent gotten no sleep, Im losing people left and right and damn Im so lost i just sit and watch my world fall apart.Maybe this is the end of me who knows.There isnt much fight in me eft,but maybe after thi vacation things will change(I HOPE).Ok before I put a closing for remodeling on this thing let me answer your questions ahead of time.1)When will part 3 be out?=Itll be out when I return along with a story i have been wrking on with a girl and her first time.20Will you still be updating this journal?=No i wont not untill I get back or giving people warning before than.3)How long will you be gone?=Only time will tell but it shouldnt be long .

*I have been here for a while I dont even recognize myself no more

*It feels like my entire body is floating and my feet cant find the floor

*A have become use to the darkness and the shadows that plague this space

*Ive learned to adapt and to change and make it my own place

*Im no longer the same as I feed off the darkness of this world that is real

*I have lost my soul, my heart, and my mind, and a darkness is all I feel

*This evil that drapes me feels up my empty spaces and gives me the strength to go on

*I wonder what everyone will think when they see what I have become

*People have left me here to hurt and to die

*Though I have done the opposite I smile and I rise

*My personality has changed like of a rabid dog going after his next meal

*I wonder to myself will I be able to make it or will I be killed

*I dont care no more because everyone that doubted me will fall to my wrath

*I am uncontrollable so stay out of my path

This is my third entry and im finally getting the hang of this thing so lets get down to business.Yesterday was one of dem days people were out to cause drama.First off my ex called me at 6 a.m. and i was like wdf!!!She talking bout she miss me and stuff but Im like at six in the morning?Than I guess she it was that time of the month becuase she just flipped and was talking bout she dont appreciate girls and stuff she be seeing me with and any other time I would of hung up on here but I was drunk and was enjoying this because it showshow low someone can go to piss someone off.Anyway I let her ramble on for a minute and than I let her know that hey she messed up the game not me I cant help it you caught by cheating on me with a ni99a I was cool with(Thats 2 to the back of the head for that dumb broad).Once I got that chick off my phone I slept till 3 and than I woke up and started arguing with my other homie(Im thinking by now thisis going to be a tough day.We was arguing over how she feels that I talk all this stuff bout how I want to take care of her,be with her and treat her like no ni99a can,but she was like I need to be about it.By this time I was thinking to myself how can I if you wont let me.Than she stressed about how se wants friends only so than I just let it go I was like i thn been through shyt today Im not even about to trip,if she feels that Im not real bout mine because I wanted to come see her when she was in the hospital,text her while Im at work to see if she doing aight and try to call her to make sure she feeling better, and offer to come over there and take care of her:I guess Im inconsiderate huh?I dont know how this world works but I think I am going back to my old ways because Im tired of trying to show someone or help someone and they blow it up in my face,so its time for the rebirth ya feel me?So yea let me end this journal so I can work on my poem but I hope I can get some comments to this thing or your opinion so get at me aight.

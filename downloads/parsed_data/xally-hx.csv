Ive kind of been a lil sad lately, so i havent been my social butterfly self... just kind of hanging out by myself and a couple close friends. I did go to the CrossFade, Shinedown, and Silver Tide concert, that was awesome!! It made me happy but that was like a week ago. I dont know whats wrong with me ive just been doing a lot of thinking about some stuff and it hasnt made me feel too good about it. I just feel really alone right now... ive found somethings out about one of my best friends that i had had for 4 years... and its just made me think about what if everyone else is just using me and going to hurt me. I dunno... sorry to bring you all down. If youve missed me comment, or i prolly wont be around for much longer.....
much love to anyone who cares...."

He was done swimming and went off walking and I had to pee so me and Reesey went to find a bathroom and so we went walking down this hallway, and we got lost!! So i turned around and flipped my hair and i bumped into someone... so i turned around and was like ""ooh Im soo sorry!!"" And he was like ""its ok Ally"" and he smiled, and then this big guy came and walked the guy away, and Reesey was like Oh my gawd!! you know who that is! And then it hit me, it was MICHAEL PHELPS!! hehe i was soo shocked! Its totally fate! Me and him are destined!! hehe, but then we kept looking for him and we couldnt find him again! But it was so funny, like the first time i meet him and i totally make a fool of myself, but he knew who i was!! how cool!! Me and Reesey were supposed to come home today but decided to hang out for awhile, we're kidnapping him and bringing him home with us!! hehehe, he'll never get away from us! :)!

Hmmm.... lets see here, I went on a shopping spree with my friend and we went to these little stores that Ive never been in and it was kind of cool... like vintage stuff. So that was exciting... and I need to get back on my diet cuz im getting FAT!! ::laughs:: I need to stop going out to eat for every meal tho... cuz I have to start my new modeling job next week and I dont want to feel uncomfy around all them skinny people!! And then I went out to Mystique for a couple days... everything was starting to stress me out and getting to me. So much that my paintings and designs couldnt take my mind off of it... not even my shopping spree... :(! So that was fun... I got some of my tan back!! So that was awesome!! 
Sorry if I havent called my friends lately my phones been messing up but Im getting a new one in a couple days so Ill be able to talk to all of you!!!
Right now Im on my plane on the way to Texas! Me and a couple friends are going to see Amy and the rest of the idols in concert down there tomorrow night and its one of my friends birthdays so thats going to be cool.
But after that I should  be home... And me and a bunch of people need to get together and hang out cuz Im starting to lose touch with everyone and I barely know you. Me and Scarlett are getting together and throwing a get together, then I defintiely need to hang out with Mac and then me and Kate are going shopping. So hopefully Im getting busier and thatll take my mind off of some stuff. Id like to meet even more people but right now I kind of have no time for anything new... Im trying to get all of my designs for the new line together and done so we can start making them. I cant wait for that fun part!! Ali you better model for it girl!! ::laughs:: Its going to be fun! 
And then I think Im going to a concert in Louisville, Kentucky on September 8th! I dont really know who the people are but Ive heard a couple songs and my friend really likes them, so he invited me to it. Theyre Shinedown and Crossfade... so hopefully thats good. And hopefully something happens there for me n him!! hehehe... I need to find a new guy to dig! 
Well I need to get going, I think thats about everything thats been going on. Anyone want to call me Ill try to keep my phone on or just leave me comments and let me know how much you miss me!! ::laughs:: 
Have a good day everyone! Much Luv!

sorry its been a couple days since Ive updated in here.  Not a whole heck of a lot has been going on tho. I really have been wanting to update and comment and stuff because all of my amazing friends made me tons of cute icons and i just want to use them all cuz my computer finally let me save them!!! But I have nothing to write.... ::laughs::
I got home from Kentucky yesterday... that was a blast even tho the weather is kind of scary. The lightening and thunder is crazy down there!! But was great.
And then today I went shopping and hung out with a friend that I hadnt talked to in like a year... and shes going to stay and hang out. I think we're gonna go and try to find a happening party tonight! ::laughs::
I did some painting on the plane yesterday... I was really stressed out and that just really helps me. But I dont really like it today so I think Ill just paint and black and start again!
Ive also been working on my clothing line but I get frustrated cuz I cant get it to look like I really want it to look. And then dad tries to butt in and put his opinion in on it, I mean I know he's just trying to help and make it better but this is my thing... and I want to do it on my own, yanno?
Im not sure what else I'll be doing this week.... but I know in 8 days Im flying to Texas to go visit Amy and watch the Show the 'idols' are putting on down there. So that should be a lot of fun.
But Im going to go and hang out. I need to get changed and ready for tonight. So later on you all
Call me (ANYONE!) cuz I havent talked to anyone in the last couple days or leave me messagey love... so Im here

My brother won this little race thingy for the 4-wheeling games and then I met this cute guy and he took me 4-wheeling which was a blast. But I almost died cuz I was wearing my new heels and we had drank a little bit so we were all over the place. And he went thru this field and when we got done I had cow shit all over me....  but I never saw any cows!!! So that was gay. Then we went and got a bite to eat and I showered!!!!  And then I got in my sweats cuz I didnt care if they got messed up. And then we went 4-wheeling in the dark, that was so scary cuz I dont think they know what they are doing half the time!! But other than that nothing really happened. I rode a horse and almost got thrown off, it was scary!! Kentucky's pretty cool, its warm and pretty. Perfect for the stuff we're doing. I also got to lay out for a little bit, so thats good.
But Im not sure what we're going to be doing for the rest of the night but we're staying here til tomorrow night. So Im making myself right at home... hehe.
Well talk to you all later on. Bye bye

 So today I had a blast with Mac, but now he's in LA... and im sad! hehehe.... I'll be out there soon and we definitely gotta do something when I do. Im scared tho, cuz I think Im flying out to Kentucky tomorrow afternoon cuz my brother has some big four-wheeling thing he wants to do down there and he wants me to come. It wont be that bad cuz 4-wheeling is fun, Ive done it a couple times, but Im too scared to ever drive one!! I think when we get there Ill call up Orlando and see where he is and if he's busy or whatever, maybe we can hang out and he can show me around when he's done shooting. So thatd be cool...
Im sooo excited, cuz when I was sick I lost 5 pounds that week, and I went shopping today after me and Mac's lunch and I bought a bunch of cute things! Now I need to go out some more and actually have a cool place to wear them!! hehehe
I really want to go to a concert... I havent been to one in a really long time. So if any one knows a good one around anywhere, I can get to it so it dont matter where it is. I havent really been listening to anything really so I wouldnt even know whats hot right now.
Well Im gonna go now cuz its been a long day and no telling what will happen tomorrow!! hehehe, hopefully I can make it in the country!! 
Well give me some calls and I hope to talk to every one later on

But its ok, cuz I went with my cousin and his friend! To an actual movie... Like I havnet been to a movie theater in like a year cuz we just go to the home theater and they send us movies (which is AWESOME!! every one needs to get that thing!!) We went and seen Dodgeball... I know a little late, but it was really funny!! And Vince Vaughn is a little hottie! hehe... But yea, Jude's trying to hook me up with some hot guys but I met this guy named Kyle the other day at the movies and hes really cool. I dont think anything will happen tho! Maybe my chance will come soon! Hopefully Jude can get me a good one!!
I'm sad now, cuz Jaime is gone. Shes not on here anymore and that was the only way we had been staying in touch besides the phone and now shes gone and so is her phone!! I miss her, we havent been the same since the end of the show when she went off to college and I stayed around here partying. 
I really want to go to college, I was supposed to go to her school, but I dont really like going. So I think Ill stay around here. Dad's going to get me my own line of clothes, so Im thinking of lil cute ideas for it! Anyone have any good suggestions? Im like stressing out becuase Im supposed to show a couple ideas at the beginning of the month to the head honcho dude and Ive got nothing! 
Dads fall thingy is coming along ok... I think he needs new stylist. Cuz he has great ideas and then when the ladies make them they like butcher it all up! So I'll have to talk to him about that.
I got my pictures back from last months vacation finally. Im sooooo slow at doing that. I never feel like it! And so I made my brother run to the photoshop bc I wasnt going to!! hehehe....
Well Im going to go. I have a fever again and my nurse is like flipping her gord at me. She says I need to rest but I think writing in here sort have clears my mind. I havent really opened up yet, but Im getting there!! hehe
WEll talk to you all later

It was funny, but i got grouned from the phone and my friend! like they can really ground me?! that was yesterday and im using the phone today and the only reason im not doing something with that friend is because she's in DC, and im flying to California for a couple days in the morning.
I also dyed my hair, its not really black anymore, its a little lighter, i like it. But im going to get it cut soon, not too short tho, cuz its finally growing out.
I met a new guy tho, the last relationship i had kind of fizzled out so im interested in getting to know him and just having a little fun. He's my friends boyfriends friend, kind of confusing but he's HOT! and he wasted no time! hehehe... it was fun

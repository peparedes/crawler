"event","Some weeks ago Jason posted an entry chronicling his goals for this coming year. I didn't do the same last year, but I had a few goals I wished to complete in 2007. One of these, I completed a mere half an hour ago, so while it wasn't in 2007, I feel I should chronicle the completion of my goals for 2007:

- Go to Japan. Check.
- Play rugby for Gordon. Check.
- Start wrestling training. Check.
- Organise education for 2008. Check.
- Get Ls. Check.

It is the last one which I have completed this day. Which I'm happy about. I now have photo ID that isn't my passport!

Now, I might as well use this opportunity to post goals for this year.

- Do well in my TAFE course (Remedial Massage for those who <strike>fail it</strike> don't know)
- Have my wrestling debut
- Attain employment close to home/TAFE (I'm thinking doing an RSA and getting a job as a bartender in the city)

As you can see it's a work in progress. I'll update this when I come up with more."

<lj-cut text=""SPOILERS...YOU KNOW THE DRILL"">England def. Australia 12-10
France def. New Zealand 20-18

Apparently Australia's scrum fell down (someone who watched the game could clarify this for me) and so that's why we lost. Oh, and defense was a bit iffy too, or so I heard.

I don't know much about the France/New Zealand game, but it too is a surprising result on paper.

"event","So I had a look at a standings table today of the Rugby World Cup, and it had the four teams who have a guaranteed quarterfinal spot highlighted. As you may expect, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand are three of the four, but guess who got slot four?

<lj-cut text=""HERE BE SPOILERS"">(team at the top is locked into the quarterfinals, teams in the middle still have a chance, teams at the bottom are locked out completely)

<u>Pool A</u>
South Africa - P3, W3, L0 - 14 points (2 Bonus Points)

Tonga - P3, W2, L1 - 9 points (1 Bonus Point)
England - P3, W2, L1 - 9 points (1 Bonus Point)

Samoa - P3, W0, L3 - 1 point (1 Bonus Point)
United States - P2, W0, L2 - 0 points (0 Bonus Points)

<u>Pool B</u>
Australia - P3, W3, L0 - 15 points (3 Bonus Points)

Wales - P3, W2, L1 - 10 points (2 Bonus Points)
Fiji - P3, W2, L1 - 10 points (2 Bonus Points)

Japan - P4, W0, L3 - 3 point (1 Bonus Point) (1 Draw)
Canada - P3, W0, L2 - 2 points (0 Bonus Points) (1 Draw)

<u>Pool C</u>
New Zealand - P3, W3, L0 - 15 points (3 Bonus Points)

Scotland - P3, W2, L1 - 10 points (2 Bonus Points)
Italy - P3, W2, L1 - 8 points (0 Bonus Points)

Romania - P3, W1, L3 - 5 points (1 Bonus Point)
Portugal - P4, W0, L4 - 1 points (1 Bonus Point)

Argentina - P3, W3, L0 - 14 points (2 Bonus Points)

Ireland - P3, W2, L1 - 9 points (1 Bonus Point)

Georgia - P3, W1, L2 - 5 points (1 Bonus Point)
Namibia - P3, W0, L3 - 0 points (0 Bonus Points)

Not overall surprising, but good for Argentina anyway. I can personally see Wales, Scotland and France getting through to the quarterfinals as well, but I'm not sure about England and Tonga. England now have Jonny Wilkinson back, so he make a bit of a difference, but they've been doing fairly badly so far, so yeah. If I had to pick one it'd be England, but I wouldn't be surprised if Tonga got through.</lj-cut>"

Guess what happened?

The final score was 36-0 to the Springboks. That's pretty depressing for the defending champions. Sucks to be them right now.

<lj-cut text=""SPOILERS MORE RUGBY WORLD CUP RESULTS SPOILERS"">Since my last post, the following results have come in:

South Africa 59 - 7 Samoa

Ireland 32 - 17 Namibia
Argentina 33 - 3 Georgia</lj-cut>

Nothing overly surprising barring the England/South Africa result.

Wales vs Australa, New Zealand vs Portugal and Ireland vs Georgia are happening tonight, and Fiji vs Canada, France vs Namibia and Samoa vs Tonga are happening tomorrow. Wales vs Australia should be interesting, but the rest I don't think will be anything to write home about.

<b>EDIT:</b> Having just watched the second half of New Zealand vs Portugal, while Portugal got hammered in the scoreline 108-13, it was quite something for them to score against arguably the best international rugby team right now, and they did have some pretty good sections of play."

"event","So my rugby season is now over. We were supposed to play against Penrith today in our last match, but that didn't happen, for the following reason:

Saturday 4th August: we are told we're playing against Penrith, at Penrith, around midday-ish, with a bus to take us there and back with 2nd through 4th Grade.
Thursday 9th August: I get to training, and I'm told that the game has been moved to 9:50am at Penrith, with no bus.

So yeah. There was a team discussion of the people who were at training, and it was decided that along with the stupid time and place, we would also likely have problems with numbers, and so we officially forfeited. Not the best way to end a season, but it's better than getting up at 5am to get out to Penrith to get beaten, and probably not field a full team.

Now, I'm going to wait and see where and when the 1sts and 2nds are playing their semi-finals, and I might go along and watch. Once their final series are over, then I'll call the guy I need to call about my wrestling training.

Soon. Very soon.

On a completely unrelated note, the walk from St. Leonards station to Naremburn Oval is shorter than I remember."

"event","What up guys? It's been a feggin' long time since my last entry and I felt like making a new one. Why? See the title.

So. I haven't posted since the end of the HSC in November, and most of you know the interesting stuff that's happened between now and then, so I'll just focus on some more recent stuff.

The rugby season's nearly over now. Our last game's on the 11th of August against Penrith, and then there are finals and stuff. Only we didn't quite do well enough to get there. Oh well. It also occurred to me recently that the August 11 rugby game is going to be my last rugby game for a while if everything goes to plan. See, as I've mentioned before to most of you, my dream is to be a professional wrestler. I've had my eye on a wrestling school in Dulwich Hill for a fair while now, and I'm going to ring up the guy I need to speak to tomorrow morning and get stuff done so I can enrol. Most rugby at senior level (ie: U19s and up, Gordon or otherwise) is on Saturdays. So are the classes at this school in Dulwich Hill.

So unless one of you guys happens to have a Time-Turner somewhere, I won't be playing rugby again next year. But I'll be training to be a wrestler, which would be quite awesome.

I've also begun the legwork for organising my tertiary education next year. Most of you know I got a fairly shitty UAI, and so my best option is TAFE. I've been looking around a bit over the last few days, and have found a course that will (apparently) assist me into getting into Physiotherapy. The course is a Diploma of Remedial Massage. It does sound kinda suss at first glance, but if you think about it, it makes sense. If it still doesn't make sense, focus on the word <i>remedial</i>. That should help.

So anyway, I'll be looking at the Randwick TAFE campus for this assuming I get into it, and so that means I'll be able to come and visit you UNSB guys if schedules don't clash horribly.

Lastly, my parents are in the final planning stages for their trip over to England in early August. My brother's over there right now in a place called Pershore, near Worcester, and he's been playing cricket there since about May. My parents are going to visit him, then traipse around through Wales, Scotland, Ireland and possibly Germany while they're there. But that's not the interesting part. The fun part is that I get the house to myself for at least some of the time they're gone! My grandma's insisting that she come down and stay for a bit, but I don't think she'll be here the whole time my parents are gone.

I think that's all the interesting stuff that's happened recently or is happening soon that you guys don't already know about."

I really enjoyed performing throughout the Drama course, and it's good to have finally done our HSC performances, but I am going to miss the performance side. Fretze said we're going to be revising for the rest of the term, which'll be...interesting. I say this because I don't think many people will be particularly enthusiastic to revise something which happens to be a Drama written exam.

Oh, something else interesting today. We got our English results back, as did everyone else. I'm not going to list all my marks because they were all pretty average/shocking. However, one mark was absolutely hilarious. Chi and a few other people wrote between 2.5 and 3 pages, and got 9/20, with the comment ""write more"" at the end. I wrote one page and got 8/20. Yeah, 8/20. For one page. LOLworthy if I do say so myself. I was laughing all the way to Japanese.

<b>EDIT:</b> Oh, by the way, for those of you who haven't heard, Drama performances went extremely well. We all killed it, the markers were really nice, and the audience was really responsive and an all-around good audience. Surprising considering it was made up mostly of year 11s."

I don't know what the purpose of that quote was. I suppose I could come up with one to practice for English.

Do any of you, my loyal readers (lol), believe in fate? Do you believe that there are certain things that are just meant to happen?

I do, to an extent. I believe that you have choices at every stage in your life, but there are certain stops that must be made along the way. You can try and choose your way away from them, but fate drags you there anyway. And right now, I feel like I'm nearing one of those points. I feel like I'm destined to fail.

Firstly, I get badly sick for two weeks straight, missing some important school time, and being unable to prepare at all for my trials until today (which I spent scrounging stuff for English). I end up missing my Japanese Speaking trial in the process. Then, I find out that I missed a shitload in Chemistry, which impacts on my Chem practical (read: I have no fucking clue what to do for it, since everyone else learnt about it in the two weeks I was absent). It seems like I'm having shit piled on me consistently.

And I'm fucking sick of it. This isn't the first time I've been told by fate ""No! Bad Tim! *smack*"", and I'm sick of it happening. I tried, this time around, to actually do better, and it seems like I'm having shit shoveled on me persistently.

Should I even bother when every time I try and get up I just get shoved back down again?

Now, at this point, I'd probably bitch a little about being back at school, but I'm not! I've been quite sick for the past week and a half, with a temperature of 38 degrees until Saturday (with my normal being 36.5), and then a fucking annoying cough that won't go away! I went and saw the doctor again yesterday morning, and he sent me to get a blood test. Why?

He thinks I might have whooping cough.

This would be bad news any day of the year, but right now is an even worse time for me to be sick like this. With Trials looming, I can't afford to miss school. So far I've learnt that what I've missed in English is catch-up-able, and that in Chem I've missed a lot. Oh, I've also missed doing my Japanese Speaking for the Trials, so I'm going to have to do that when I get back. Joy! A mountain waiting for me!

1) Exams. Bleh. I did alright in my Chem Prac, got pwned in Maths and English, got average-ish for Jap and got nearly pwned in Drama.

2) Drama performance coming up. To quote Star Wars, ""I have a bad feeling about this"". Nothing in particular, it just doesn't feel...right.  *shrug*

3) zOMG FILLER MATERIAL~!

That's seriously all of note that's happened in the past few weeks. Until Monday.

Monday was a normal-ish day, except for the fact that my presence had been requested at a Gordon Representative rugby training that afternoon, meaning I'm likely to be playing reps now as well as my club and school rugby. Yes, it's nice to be acknowledged such, but FUCK that's annihilated my Monday afternoon. Now it's come home, eat, leave, fitness trainer til 6:15, rugby training from 6:30 til 8:00, come home, shower, dinner, bed. And it adds to my already nearly-full fitness regime. Monday morning, laps at North Sydney pool, and the arvo's already mentioned. Wednesday morning (starting next week), school rugby training, then a game in the afternoon and then training at night. Friday morning, water polo training then a game at night. Sunday, club rugby game. Oh well. I need it.

Tuesday was the day of the long-awaited Crawford Shield celebration assembly. They teased it and teased it, and finally, with Horrific Scenario playing the school song in the background, out comes Northey in the Don suit! Took long enough! And as I said to him at the dance (he was there, not dancing though) he did say he'd conduct an entire assembly in the suit, so he still hasn't fulfilled his promise entirely yet.

Oh, right, the dance. That was pretty good. Song recycling was a bit much, especially that Love Generation song which I'm quite over, and MY HUMPS GODDAMNIT KILL ALL MURDER BREAKAGE DEATH RAARGH!!

Ahem. Excuse me.

The night was alright. Tony was hilariously drunk, Peter Son was falling over, the amount of people thinking they'd be ""original"" coming as KISS was astounding, and I woke up this morning still partially deaf. Meh, it was worth it.

It's kinda scary to think that in two and a half weeks, we'll be halfway through the school part of year 12. It's kinda hard to believe we're nearly halfway there. Still, the HSC looming on the horizon is not looking particularly pleasant, although Japan hiding behind that is a bit more positive.

We'll just see what happens.

Ooh, just remembered, we had a trial game for school rugby today against Asquith Boys. We got defeated 35-5, which is alright for a team that hasn't played together in this combination, and people playing out of position, and us probably being more suited to the 2nds rather than the 1sts. Oh, I mentioned it was 35-5? The 5 was from me! First try for the season, and it wasn't even in an official competition game. Not bad, eh?"

I am quite glad that I'm changing English teachers. I also find it rather amazing that we were more productive in one lesson with Bradley than we were in four weeks with <i>him</i>. Sacco being back to our class is good. At least we're gonna learn now :P

I downloaded the demo for Star Wars: Empire at War yesterday. The demo is a bit restrictive, and the game is only a tiny bit above average when it comes to the actual RTS elements, but the fact that it's so inherently Star Wars supercedes this and makes it thoroughly awesome. One cannot deny how cool it is to see a couple dozen Y-Wings destroying a Star Destroyer (how ironic). The visuals are good, but a tad lacking in detail, and the sound is just plain awesome. I cannot wait to get the full version of this game.

King Lear is an insanely boring play in the middle parts. The beginning's good, the ending is cool, but the middle is PAINFULLY tedious, and I had to fight the urge to fall asleep, due to the fact that I had to watch it myself (again as a result of my now-ex English teacher's incompetence). Must admit that the payoff was worth bearing the tedium, though.

Rugby season's coming up again. I've got my orientation day thingo in about two hours, which will basically involve catching up with people from last year and meeting any newcomers. A pity that school rugby's not going to be nearly as promising as club rugby. We currently have a two person back line and are missing about one or two people from our forward pack. Pretty shocking, but I've begun talks with other years to scrounge more people up so we can actually have a team. And we're getting that Mr. Mitchell person from PE as our coach apparently, which is another plus; we don't have many teachers who can actually coach a rugby team.

Eh, that'll do for now. Better go and tackle some of these Chem pracs I need to finish.

I have managed to attend every single carnival this school has held, and I intend to keep that streak alive throughout year 12 if at all possible. Besides, I may actually enter something this year, although that's doubtful.

I think it's funny that they expect us to care that it counts as a proper school day as far as attendance is concerned, considering that only a handful of the prefects, myself, and maybe a dozen at most other people from our grade are going to be there. I think even the lower grades are beginning to learn to not bother.

- He cannot (or chooses not to) take any responsibility for anything
- He spends little time doing anything he has to do
- He acts very immaturely most of the time

The final piece is an important one. Now, no-one wants to spend all their time studying (unless they have no life), but nor should anyone spend all their time neglecting study. My brother finished his HSC last year, and, due to the fact that he spent most of his time out partying, drinking, smoking, etc, he managed to score an astounding 37.95 as his UAI. You read that correctly. 37.95.

What is there to possibly discuss? School? OK, let's see...ooh, the common room a.k.a. the school's latest exercise in procrastination. It took them less time to make significant progress on that new big IA/CAPA building out the back than it did for them to finish gutting the toilet block and putting up a wall. Is it She Who Must Not Be Named's(*) fault? Possibly. Maybe they just contracted two different groups for the separate construction. But that wouldn't really make sense, now would it?

Although, this is our school I'm talking about.

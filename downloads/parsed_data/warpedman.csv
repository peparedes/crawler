"event","well I must admit that so far bein married is cool :)...great wife, great son, and Im sure that soon we will have a great daughter too :).  Ive for the most part moved in with Jessie at her parent's house, and things are goin ok so far.  I think that Joe's noggin is starting to wrap itself around things, cause hes getting used to me living here.  Im not sure he totally understands Im his daddy or that I live with mommy forever from here on out, but he's still noodling things out as any good 5 year old boy would.  He also helped me and Jessie pick out a few things to register for at Target when we were picking out stuff for his little sister :D.  He still has his usual up and down days, as do Jessie and I, but we're slowly getting closer as a family.  Our wedding ceremony went very well, and just about everyone I know is asking for pictures, so over the next few days we plan on picking out the best ones to show everybody.  I truely feel that I have the best woman in the world as my wife, and the best little boy as a son and (soon) best daughter too.  I now have what I always wanted...a good job with great co-workers, a wonderful in all ways wife, and two good kids.  This is one of the best times of my life!!!"

"event","well, on Monday I will be going in to the doctor to get my cholesterol re-checked and to see about getting some anti-depressants.  Ive come to the point where Im just so tired of being depressed all the time, and it was seeing how hard it was on Jessie that made that happen.  I dont want to be a major source of stress and pain in Jessie's life, and I really want to be someone the kids can look up to instead of someone who's always second-guessing himself.  The only thing Im asking for at this point is that when the meds start kicking in that Jessie is right in saying I'll have the confidence I need to make things better."

"event","well, despite all the setbacks the camping trip was fun.  I got to spend last weekend with the best woman in the world, and she still likes me :).  Granted, some things went awry...I forgot my sleeping bag, we forgot the ice, the tent was ghetto-fantastic, Jessie fell in the water right after getting onto me about splashing her, we couldnt start a fire, and we got lost driving a few times...but we were able to laugh at ourselves which was pretty cool :).  All in all Im glad I went, cause it was really fun for me, and Im glad I got to spend the weekend before my new job with Jessie :)"

"event","well, I have mixed news today.  This mornin before work I went in and did a drug test for Glacier, the water place, and then went to Publix.  While I was at work Jessie told me she had reserved a place at a campsite so Im happy about that.  Im still waiting on the bank place to tell me if Im hired or not so Im nervous about that.  And finally I found out that Brandi is pregnant.  Im not sure she knows what shes getting herself into, because in the almost 3 months Ive been goin out with Jessie and bein the closest thing to a dad Joe has, Ive learned that bein a parent isnt what I expected, even though all I am right now is a friend of Joes.  I dunno, we'll see, I guess Im just concerned is all."

Im also beginning to have my doubts about the water place, cause I havent heard a peep out of them since they talked to my boss then turned around and told me how grumpy and shocked Mary is.  Jessie and most of my other friends swear that I should just wait till monday or tuesday before I start getting nervous, but what they dont realise is that Ive seen this same pattern so many times that I know what it usually means...that I dont have a new job.  I suppose its still possible that they're just taking their time, but with each passing day that becomes less likely.  Sorry Jessie, but sometimes stuff like this happens to people no matter how hard they try"

I just hope that training goes well on the machines and that I can get up and running real soon, cause the longer I work at Publix the more likely it is that Mary is gonna make it a living nightmare.  If things end up not working out at my new job I dont know what Im gonna do, cause that means the only usable proffesional reference I'll have will be from my 1999-2000 job, assuming she still works there.  Yeah, one heck of a resume, let me tell you...3 of my 5 previous employers dont exist in my state anymore, and my most recent employer (Publix, via Mary) probably hate my guts now.  Anyway time to go to work and hope the bank leaves a voicemail saying I start Monday."

"event","Well, on Tuesday I had an interview with Glacier waters to become some kind of technician on their water machines ya see in the front of grocery stores...the other was on Wednesday with a small bank where Id be doin indexing and general office stuff.  To this point Glacier has offered me the job and Id start out workin full time makin 10 an hour with a company pickup, gas card, and truck maintenance card in addition to all the normal benefits after 90 days.  The other job is supposed to let me know by Friday afternoon if I have the job or not, and if I am offered it Id be makin 8 an hour but the insurances would be free for just me (company would pay) and Id be actually workin in an office for once which is what I really want.  Either way Im gonna take the job though because Ive given Mary every last chance to help me get ahead in the company and the management keeps stabbing me in the back, so whichever job I get Im gonna take cause I'll finally be rid of that woman!!!  And all I can say is its about friggin TIME I get an offer, Ive only been workin my butt off tryin to get something to work in my favor :P"

"event","ok so here's the deal...Ive been staying up late lately (I have no idea why, other than Im just not sleepy when its time for bed) and I wound up goin to sleep around 7:30 this mornin.  I woke up around 9:30 but before I did I had a dream:


I remember being in in this strange house that had an unfinished basement.  part of my moms side of the family was over...my grandma, sister, and my cousin that had a baby were there along with me, her, and my brothers.  my aunt and grandma were washin dishes in the kitchen.  next thing I remember is being in the basement having a meal and going to get salad dressing and then changing my mind and going back cause the 1 kind we had was weird.  I suggested finishing part of the basement but my bro's said no.  I then remember bein at some sorta bar hangin with a gal.  my bro had a comp and I thought he was signed in as a friend of mine but he explained that it was just cause his comp looked different cause his used a different version of windows that made it look that way.  he got up and left then I hung with the gal and then I hung with some guy.  the guy got up to go somewhere and I got up after a few seconds to follow him, and I saw him get hit in the back of the head by someone and the security guard made everyone stand back while the hitter left.  There was an investigation of everyone there, takin pictures of all the witnesses...I somehow was leading sme ppl through a tunnel shoulder width and just high enough to crawl thru and Id had my letter jacket with medals on since before my friend got hit.  I came out of the tunnel into this small compartment that was just big enough to curl up in before the wall behind me closed.  I was about to get out the other way but this white thing came down and blocked me from getting onto the futuristic train tracks.  it came back up but then this glass thing came down and covered it.  it came up soon too, and I got part way out and started talkin to someone who befriended me (I was beginning to feel like James Bond and I already knew this new gal and gave me this tiny doll, and then I woke up."

"event","Have you ever had the feeling that you missed out on what you were supposed to do, that now all you can do is just kinda plod along till the end?  Thats how I feel some days.  Dont get me wrong, Im sure God has something in mind still for me, I just dont know what that is.  I want so much to do what He wants me to do but sometimes I dont know what that is, so I just guess.  Some Christian, huh, when I dont know how to look God in the eye and know where He wants me to take the next step.  There are so many things in my life that I wish I could change, that I wish had gone completely differently, but I cant change those things now.  All I can do is look back on all the mistakes Ive made and hope and pray that someday God will allow me the privelage of knowing what its like to have succeeded in doing what I was designed to do, to hear Him say ""well done...now come home and sit with me forever"".

I believe Boromir said it best: ""She said to me, even now, there is hope left, but I cannot see it. It is long since we had any hope. My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing, and our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right and I would do it. I would see the glory of Gondor restored...""

I used to outright not believe people when they said nice things about me, that I still had much hope for the future but now I dunno...I WANT to believe them but I dont know for sure I really have hope.  I will fight every day of my life to have everything God has promised me, but I must also realise that just because HE plays by the rules doesnt mean everyone else does.  We'll see what happens..."

"event","My Dearest Jessie,

        I just wanted to tell you that our relationship over this past month or so has meant so much to me.  I had begun to think that I would never be able to be in a relationship in which someone loved me for who I really was, and then you came along.  to date I have been myself, and even cried a few times, and shared some of my deeper secrets with you and yet you choose to honor me with your continued friendship and for that I will be forever grateful.  Your loving me for who I really am has helped me so much more than you will ever know.  I realise that it is hard bein a single mom...harder still to find someone you can trust after all you've been through...and yet here you are saying that you care for me so much, and its all I can do to not break down and just cry on my hands and knees because you treat me so much better than I deserve.  You are so beautiful and so kind and so caring that to be honest, when I first asked you out to the concert I thought that you would by default say no because I was so much below what you needed in your life.  Knowing that you think so much of me despite the fact that I cant support you in every way shape and form that I wish I could has made me feel so much more special than I could ever thought I could feel...I hope to someday show you even a token of the appreciation and love and support and caring and so many other things that you deserve for being such a wonderful and caring person.

Always in your debt,
Matt"

I want so much to make her life a living paradise as long as I am with her, and will do anything and everything to make her feel like the queen of my life that she is.  She has given me a reason to fight on...before, when it was just me in my future, I didnt see much point in bein the best I could be, because there would be no one to share it with.

"event","I dont know what to write, because I have a jumble of images, emotions, thoughts and memories floating through my head right now but here it goes.  Everyone tells me that in order for me to ever amount to anything I have to first believe in myself and know my true worth before I do anything else.  You see, the only problem with that is that no matter what I do I cant shake this feeling that Ive gone into the wilderness.  It used to be that I knew exactly what I wanted out of life and everything and that I felt I could achieve it.  Lately however, Ive had to push harder to get it.  You know what keeps me going on though?  One of the things that keeps me going is this 19 year old gal Ive never actually met face-to-face named Brandi that thinks of me as her big brother.  Ive been talking to her since 2001 and while she is not a Christian she still calls me her big brother (or as she calls me Bubberz) and is quick to remind me she loves me.  Her love means so very much to me in this rough part of my life.  I would do whatever I could to protect her, keep her safe, and someday bring her to know the love of God like I know it.  Today has been kinda hard on me too...Ive wanted to be an accountant for years now but each time I try something to bring myself closer to that I only end up driving myself away from it...like today I accepted a full time job as a janitor cause its the only full time job at all I can get.  I dunno, maybe God has something else in mind besides accounting.  All I ask is that He not only show me what His will is for my life but that He also give me the strength and support I need to accomplish it.

God, please show me your will in my life.  I am so alone and scared right now...God please forgive me for ever having doubted your infinite love, wisdom and caring for me.  I want to follow you all the days of my life far beyond my ability to do so and ask that you help me do so.  Please show me the way you would have me go, please bring me along that path and please never let me forget that no matter what, you will always be here with me.  God, I love you so very much and humbly beg that you forgive me of my sins and help me see the beauty you have created in me only, and not anything I have done to mar it.  Please let me be nothing but proud to be called yours and continue to comfort and heal my broken heart and spirit while I go down the path you have laid bare for me to see.  God, Im so scared because I dont know what to do.  Please remove these scales from my eyes so that I can see what it is you would have me do in all things.  Please forgive me of my sins and please show me where to go from here in terms of my career and my romance.  I love you God, and please be with me always.

Amen


I have recently met a wonderful young woman named Jessica who is divorced and has a 4 year old son.

The only drawback though is that Id be working halftime...7am to 7pm saturday and sunday.  Ive had several people suggest that I take the job if Im offered it, because I need to start wherever I can, but I refuse to give up church (which will lead to my ETERNAL reward) for a job (which will only be temporary).  As I recall, its 1st John chapter one that says that if we're walkin in the light with God that we wont forsake walking the fellowship.  I dont care if I have to live on the streets...nothing id more important to me than following God, and I need the constant fellowship of other Christians to help me with that...anyone who believes otherwise is either lying or needs to write a book and give me a signed copy.  Otherwise I dont want to hear it."

"event","Well, things aren't always as bad as they seem.  I know I've been very hard on myself lately but it has been necessary.  The main reason I always push so hard to improve myself is because no matter how good I am now, I can always be better in some way.  Yes, there is only so much I can do sometimes.  Yes, I am a great guy already.  But you know what?  I can still improve myself.  I know I will get the job I'm looking for someday if I keep trying but I can speed that process up if I not only keep trying but also keep improving.  I know I dont HAVE to get better to be good since I am already a great friend and honorable man, but that doesn't mean I can't continue to get better.

It seems a lot of people I talk to seem to confuse me always trying to improve myself as a matter of principal with the idea that I'm not happy with myself.  That's not the case.  I AM happy with myself and who I am.  I am proud of all that I have done for myself and my friends over the years and what I'm sure I will do in the future.  I make everyone smile and sometimes even laugh...and I think they know what they mean to me.

I guess the main reason I've gotten depressed lately is because things aren't turning out anything like I'd planned.  Don't get me wrong things are goin pretty good for me...I have a part time job, a place to stay, food to eat and friends who care very much for me.  I guess where the hangup is is that I am not where I want to be YET.  I am a work in progress and as such I will always continue to improve myself.  In time, I will be something so much better than I am that even the great man I am now will be nothing.  In the mean time though, I am a good man and despite the mistakes I have mad I am an honorable, caring young man who is destined to do many more great things in the lives of those he comes in contact with,"

I know the real me and I am him every moment of every day. I have been told by almost every female Ive met in the past month that I am like a brother to her.

I can be myself all I want to be, but at the end of the day it doesnt get me even a millimeter closer to my goals.  this is why I fight and struggle so very hard to change and improve myself, because no matter how far I have come I still have a long way to go.  the worst part is, no one can tell me how to get there, so I have to just point and shoot and have faith I am doing the right thing.  its so hard some days...I wake up every morning knowing that great things in store for me but I cant shake the feeling sometimes that I might miss them because Im not able to do something as simple as get a job.  everytime I get that rare interview my hopes soar as I wonder if this will be the job that will finally get me back on track but when I find out I didnt get the job I end up just as low as before, because it turns out I wasnt good enough to get the job for whatever reason.  its ironic...Ive given hope to so many people Ive met over the years, and I even have hope myself, but lately the things Ive told others in order to help them sometimes seem hollow in my own ears.  the one thing that will help me get through the hard times is never there.  all I ever want when I am down is someone to sit next to me and hold my hand.  thats all I ask, a hand to hold.  is that too much to ask?  just holding that hand would reassure me so much in those hard moments but when I reach out all I can find is my pillow.  even as I sit here writing this and fighting back the tears I know that someday I will finally find a hand when I reach out, that I will have the income I need to move out, but RIGHT NOW, when I really need that hand the most, its not there.  so again I sit here and ramble on and hope that no one reads this and sees this side of me, but I know that some will.  I know that they will feel bad for me and want to help but unfortunately they cant.  I know it will hurt them as well and I wish it didnt, because I hate causing anyone pain.  I just hope they can forgive me for hurting them this way.  anyway its time again to go to bed so I can get the requsite 4 or 5 hours of sleep so I can get up, read those books I checked out from the library, and use them to hopefully get me that job Ive been struggling desparately to get since june of 1999."

Then, I played some Literati with some new friends I met named Karen, Robin, Roy for a while till they had to go do stuff.  After that I went to the library to get a book on writing resume's, a book on writing Cover Letters, and a book on doing well in interviews.  Tonight, I plan on goin into work a lil early and asking to be trained as a cashier, then when Im actually at work just clean like they need (I wasnt scheduled for tonight, but they need some detail cleaning done).  If possible Im going to use this as my daily self-imposed social training.  Hopefully by the end of the night I will have had an actual conversation with a random customer."

I dreamt that I was back at work at a job I used do (im pretty sure it was First Horizon) after bein lasoed by the feet and pulled through the Stargate, and I wasnt prepared for anything.  we were in a school classroom as the guy taught us all somethin new.  he had to step out for a sec and I went out too and next thing I know Im on the beach. so there I am helpin the gal that trained me at that job (for some reason lookin different) try to help her find her sandals which had been taken as a prank.   we came upon this sand pile that was square and probably 7 feet tall and was hollow on the top and inside to the ground,  I told her I would look inside but only after chipping off a corner to make sure it wasnt an ant hill so I tap the pile and see theres a few larger than normal ants in it and we agree I wont search it, but then kids start climbin on it and we stop them, then for some reason I right click and say close, and next thing I know Im not on the beach but in a chat room...and then I woke up.

In addition my friend found out last minute that she had to go to a meeting last minute and couldnt have lunch with me, so I wound up eating lunch at a seafood place by myself, then driving around for a while drinkin energy drinks and looking for now hiring signs around town (apparently only wendy's and auto world are hiring right now).  Later last night I applied online for 15 jobs and Emily also suggested going to GSW...assuming I can arrange the financing I would love to go.  It has the potential to help me out in so many ways.  Id be out of the house & on my own; Id be able to finish my degree and make it easier to get a REAL job (something her and I would both be real happy for) and I could SO use the help finding --->local<--- friends to hang out with & help learning how to be myself, be comfy with me, & so many other things related to me as a person.  I really hope it all works out [crosses fingers and toes, considers crossing eyes too just to make sure]

Also, I remember I had weird dreams last night but I dont really remember what about.  The only thing I really remember is something about a guy and his wife about to divorce with the wife more than likely getting the kid...at the end something happened and the lady got some note or letter or whatever that got her to consider going back with the guy, and the very last thing I remember is the guy getting some official document with her writing on the side sayin something like ""Never forget, Ive always loved you""...I remember bein off to the side seein the dream happen, then as he looked down suddenly I was him, and as he/I read it I heard a mans voice that wasnt mine say what he/I was reading and I began to tear up.  It was at that point I woke up and for a second I was feeling what the guy was feelin, this almost humble sort of feeling and I for a second thought I was crying till I felt my eyes and knew that I wasnt...the feeling went away almost immediately but the end of the dream stuck with me for some reason."

It seems that lately the only major things Ive done for myself (or things in general for that matter) have been A.) visit Cheryl in Va, and B.) start thinking much higher of myself & be a lil bolder.  While I admit I have a long way to go, I am still glad that things dont seem so bad.  I can finally admit to myself the good things I do, and I am bein ok with myself.  This time last year I would have surprised myself very much if I mustered up the courage to ask any female to hang out with me one-on-one on any level.  Now, however, I am much more confident.  Ive had a girlfriend for a month, been on dates with two other lovely ladies (all three are great in their own ways) and the day after I get back from vacation, I am going to have lunch with a female friend I havent seen in years.  Im also much more confident than I used to be that I will be [reasonably] successful financially and that someday I may have the privelage of marrying.  although it would be nice to have someone I can always rely on no matter what for help, I realise that for the time being no human is going to fill that role.  That having been said, I will simply rely on each of my friends for what I know they can do, should I need help.  I can do things on my own yes, but I also know the benefit of having someone help you.  Each person I know adds their own unique twist to my life, and each can help in a different way if I need it.  I am {for the time being) not going to ACTIVELY look for ""that special someone"" that everyone thinks I will find someday.  I instead have chosen to simply focus on getting financially straight so that I can move out on my own.  I dunno...maybe this is that huge thing I knew was coming...not sue though.  Either way, if anyone is reading this rest assured Im already not the man I used to be...I am doing better.  Where I will end up, I dont know."

Time is the ocean and life is a trip
You don't know where you're going
Til you know where you're at
And if you can't read the stars
Well you better have a map
A compass and a conscience
so you don't get lost at sea
Around some lonely island, where no one wants to be

From the beginning of creation, I think our maker had plan
For us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand
And let the good light guide us to the waves and the wind
To the beaches and a world where we have never been
And we'll climb upon a mountain, y'all, we'll let our voices ring
And those who've never tried they'll be the first to sing

Woah My My
I'll see you on the other side
If I make it
And it might be a long hard ride
But I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know I wanna go
Where the streets are gold
Cause you'll be there

Oh my my

You don't bring nothing with you here
And you can't take nothing back
I ain't never seen a hearse, with a luggage rack
So I've torn my knees up praying
Scarred my back from falling down
Spent so much time flying high, til I'm face first in the ground
So if you're up there watching me, would you talk to God and say,
Tell him I might need a hand to see a boat someday

Woah My My

So, here it goes:

my lady; you are brave, and fair, and have much to live for.  And many who love you.  I know it is too late to turn aside, I know there is not much point now in hoping.  If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...but...I'm not...Im just a Hobbit.  And I know I cant save middle earth.

Ya see...after 10 years of not bein outright told that you're loved by ANYONE...coupled with finding out every which way you look that you're not good enough for this, that or the other tends to really wear down on you.  Back in high school, I was this happy-go-lucky guy who didnt have a care in the world and knew exactly what he wanted and how he was gonna get it, even had a good idea when.  Now, however, all I know for sure is what I wanna be.  I want to be an accountant...but since my grades were so bad I cant graduate, or even take classes.  I would very much like to be married some day and have a family, but no matter what I do I cant seem to find someone who will actually see the real me for what it is and love me for it.  someone who will look me in the eye and say in an unwavering voice that no matter what she will be there for me and that through ALL things she wants to help me through the hard times.

Dont misunderstand me, my friends want to help, but they're 98% of the time not there when I need them...and if they are they're either just heading out the door or get mad quickly at me for a misunderstanding.  Ugh.  Anyway, if anyone is reading this please dont think any less of me...I just dont know where else to turn...whomever you are, you're the only person (if anyone at all reads this) that cares enough to read what I write.

I went out with this single mom named Serena, and we brought along her 14 month old son Sean (for those who dont know say it like Shawn).  We had lunch around 12:30 at applebee's, she had a chicken salad and I had some sorta shrimp platter.  Sean ate a lil of her chicken and a lil of my shrimp.  After that we tried unsuccesfully to find a lamp for her room, and then we went to meet her mom at a Jeep dealership.  Off and on the whole time Sean and I were honkin each others noses.  When we were with her mom and Serena was ""makin sure the toilet flushed"", I was chasin Sean on my knees tryin to honk his nose while he laughed.  We soon had to part ways tho cause Sean had to go to the doctor (he was a lil sick apparently) and when they got home from that, I found out through a call from Serena that her mom liked me (go me).

This will be my first time away from home and on my own.  With any luck, it'll work and I'll be able to minister to so many people...all because a game of checkers online at Yahoo of all things.  The only hurdles left are getting the job, the car, and convincing my parents.  Good Lord willing and the creeks dont rise, this will go smoothly.  New life, here I come."

"event","I may be on the verge of doing something that I won't be able to undo.  If all goes according to plan, I will get a job in another state, buy a car, pack up my things, and leave everything I know behind for something I have never experienced before in my life...myself.  You see, my whole life I have done everything I could to make things better for those around me while desperately holding onto the past.  This soon may not be the complete case any more.  Soon, I may leave everything I know and most of what I hold dear for something I barely know anything about.  I have been thinking of moving out of my parent's house for years now you see, but now that it may be possible, I find myself apprehensive.  Will it even happen?  If it does, will I find what I am looking for?  What am I looking for?  Will I like what I find?  If I go and it all comes crashing down around me, what then?  I just dont know.  I suppose these are the questions anyone and everyone asks at one point or another in their lives, but somehow this feels different.  I feel like this will change forever my future.  Taking one course might lead to disaster that I cant see, while the other course might lead to success which I only perceive as disaster.  Never in my life have I experienced true freedom.  Will I find it?  I dont know.  Will I find the lifelong friend that I have so desparately looked for all these years?  I dont know.  Will I even find my true calling in life?  I dont know.  There are so many things that I dont know.  There are some things Im not sure I want to know but may learn anyway.  I just dont know.  Only time will tell.  I feel like I am walking along the edge of a cliff...one wrong step, and I will never recover.  The only problem is, I am blind.  All I have are the distant voices of those who want to help and those who want to hurt me.  Whom do I trust?  The only way to know for sure is to take the next step.  Once I am presented with the choice of either freedom or support, I will know where my next step will be.  I dont know now which that will be or where it will lead, but once I decide, I will have sealed my fate.  May God have mercy on my soul."

"event","Well, happy birthday to me.  It would seem that I am now old enough to rent cars and get a discount on car insurance (why I could legally drunk before rent a car will always be beyond me).  Whoopee.  In all honesty though I feel old.  Very old.  And tired.  In the past 25 years I have had friends become pregnant, move away, drift away, change, change me, hurt me, help me, and so many other things.  If you had asked me when I was ten where I would be at 25, I most likely have said that I would have had my Bachelor's degree for 2 and a half years, be making around $50,000 a year, own my own home and car, and quite likely be married.  How naive I was then.  Since then my grades and spirits have become somehow lacking (I have a gpa in college after 122 attempted hours of 1.56).  Intelligent MY ASS.  If I were so intelligent I wouldn't have taken 5 years to finish high school.  If I were so intelligent I wouldn't be THE ONLY male in my immediate family who never went to Georgia Tech (look for an entry in 3 to 4 years saying the only person in my immediate family with no college degree or above-poverty income).  My life is crap.  I defy anyone who comes across this entry to even try to refute the previous statement.  Don't try to come up with solutions to these problems unless they DO NOT include going back to school, moving to another town, or getting a better job.  They are impossible.  Completely.  Unless, of course, you are willing to hire and train a completely untrained and mediocre male who has the qualities of a serial killer, save cruelty or purposeful injury.  The person I now realize was supposed to marry is happily married to someone else, lives halfway across the country, and has made no effort whatsoever to contact me in over six years.  I have no idea what is going to happen, all I know is that in my personal life I will not make it to the age of 26 without something major (and I mean h-bomb major) happening."

"event","Ok, so here's the deal; I'm not sure anyone who actually cares or even knows me reads this, but I occasionally have the need to vent.  That having been said, here it goes.

Have you ever been so fed up with your life that you wish you were someone so unrecognizingly different that things might actually have a minute chance of working out?  That's where I am as I type this.  You see, it took me 5 years to finish high school even though I'm so ""smart"", ""bright"", ""was such a good kid"", etc. etc. etc.  After another 5 and a half years of Jr. college with no college degree at all and still hiding the fact I'm on academic exclusion a fourth time from my parents who are letting me live at home for free while I'm going to college (of course, my dilemma is worsened by the fact that my older brother graduated from Georgia Tech with honors and my younger brother may very well do the same).  I have no marketable skills, other than cleaning toilets and running a cash register.  I look average, save only for my allegedly beautiful blue eyes (blah).  I'm the only person I know who takes dating advice from someone who is a single mom (whom I currently have a crush on) and loaned $300 to another friend even though I now have $2500 in credit card debt.  I now know where J.R.R. Tolkien got his inspiration for the character Smeagol/Gollum; someone very similar to myself.  Oh sure, I started out as a ""great guy""...not hyperactive, nice to all, did what everyone said like a good boy, did all my schoolwork and homework well and never caused trouble.  I even went so far to do what was good for everyone else that I would gladly let myself be walked all over.  That is my Smeagol side.  My other side is the Gollum side, who is now (and seemingly forever at this point) the dominant side.  Now, I buy bottles of wine, beer, and vodka and drink them in my room and hope my parents wont find out.  I am angered more and more easily even though I very rarely show it.  I constantly fantasize about being rich and famous and powerful while being essentially a grocery store janitor so that I can be alone and have no one bother me.  I blame others for my past and current mistakes even if I am partly (or fully sometimes) to blame.

This second part of me is dominant most of the time now, even though I tend to hide it well.  Most people who know me don't know these less than savory items about me, and no one but myself knows the worst of it.  No matter how hard the good side of me tries to break free, the bad side of me never gives in.  To quote Gollum, ""Once it takes hold, it never...lets...go..."".  Every time I try to rid myself of the bad side of me I constantly hear it saying ""where would you be without me?  we survive because of ME"", even though there are people in this world who would say that it is our pain that makes us who we are.

Now that all none of you have a better glimpse into the less than bright nether-regions of my mind, do you still think you know me well?

P.S.  If you are so inclined to disagree with me feel free to write; however, I would ask that you include your name and a way for me to contact you (I find that in general I am able to talk more freely to someone if we are talking online or through email, so...), please."

"event","ok, I'm feelin better now, no more frustrated face.  sorry for those of you who saw the last post and thought bad of me I just need to occaisionally do a complete vent to keep my sanity.  To be honest I don't remember why I said half that stuff and at any rate am better.  Normally Im a decent guy who (like every one else) sometimes gets depressed.  anyway, have fun everyone :D"

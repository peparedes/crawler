In <i>Holla Back Dubai! </i>There are a group of kids who are from New York and who are dealing with the aftermath of 9/11. They want to come in contact with a group of kids around the same age who live in Dubai to listen to their views and opinions of the 9/11 tragedy. The New York group of kids are good friends because we see the video clips of them in their own neighborhood hanging out and doing fun activities. We can tell that the kids from Dubai are also friends because they are all having a good time in one household. Being friends is important in a community because once friendship is formed, trust bonds begin to build. Trust is important because it allows the kids to be themselves and speak to each other with complete confidence. Trust then leads to being able to speak openly and not being afraid to do so. The kids in New York and in Dubai openly admit their views about 9/11 and that makes communication a lot easier. There were three communities in this short film, one with the kids from New York, one with the kids from Dubai, and the last community involved all of the kids in the film, from both places. Even though these kids live on separate continents they both have the common goal of world peace. These two groups of kids are in their own community because they are friends, they trust each other and are open enough to confess their views on a certain topic, and they share goals. This is what it takes to be part of a community.</p></font>&nbsp;"

It's the&nbsp;5th&nbsp;picture out of 20, it is titled ""Deserted Street"".<br /><br /><font color=""#000000"">This picture is easily the symbol of coming to a cross roads in life. The picture is of a 4-way intersection, with the stop light being red. The view the picture is taken from is so that there is two choices of roads to go down. But the person is stopped in the street, because something is holding him back. The stop light symbolizes this. The street the picture is taken of is dark, so one can imply that its late at night. The darkness however can show that the photographer is not happy and is confused. There are two options that this person can take, one is the straight forward more lighted path, the other is the left turn which is darker and more mysterious, possible more adventurous. The fact that the street is deserted could mean that the person who is taking this picture feels all alone, and no one can help him with this decision. This piece is about a crossroads in his&nbsp;life, in which he knows has to make the decision with out help and on his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>"

"event","<p><font color=""#000000"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving a dog a bath isn't always easy, but it is a task that is absolutely necessary when owning a dog. The first step in this process is to&nbsp;chose&nbsp;a dog to bathe if you have more than 1 dog, or if&nbsp;you only have one dog, he/she's the lucky winner. Then, depending on how big your dog is, you will need to pick a place for the bath to happen. If your dog is a medium or large dog, you might consider staying outside or using a human bathtub, but if your dog is small, a sink will work just fine. Next, you must get your shampoo ready.&nbsp;The shampoo with best results is either the kind that says ""Vet Recommended"" on it or ""Johnson's Baby Shampoo""&nbsp; (so that if the shampoo gets in the dogs eyes it will not&nbsp;burn the eyes.) Once&nbsp;the chosen shampoo&nbsp;is sitting near the washing area, it is time to get towels for drying the dog after his/her bath is over. If you are washing inside, a few extra towels will be found useful in case water begins to fly everywhere during this process.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's time to get your dog to the washing spot. Some dogs really enjoy baths and come running excitedly for them, most however, do not enjoy baths at all and it will take some luring to get them to the bathing area. Some useful tactics for getting your dog to a bath&nbsp;are; bribing&nbsp;with treats to get him/her to follow you, picking him/her up and physically placing them in the bathing area, or even using a collar and leash to help ""guide"" the dog to&nbsp;where the bath is happening, these are just some ideas.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the dog is in the bathing area, it is best to keep the dog on a leash&nbsp;so that he/she&nbsp;cannot escape once the bath has begun. Now, start the water, it should be warm, not hot or cold, a perfect and comfortable temperature for a&nbsp;dog. Begin by getting&nbsp;all of the dog's fur&nbsp;covered in&nbsp;the warm water. The first part of the dog to be washed is it's head, that way the dog will get slowly used to the water and not feel like he/she is drowning during the rest of the bath. So, grab the near by shampoo and massage it through your hands using quick circular motions for about 10 seconds to warm it up, this will make the shampoo about the same temperature as the dog so it will not scare him/her with strange temperatures mixing. Start washing the head by using the shampoo that is on your hands and make sure you cover the whole head, ears, chin, etc. Just try to avoid the face as much as possible, the soap and bubbles can be frightening to a dog. Once the dog's face and head have been completely washed, you may begin to rinse the shampoo off, using cup fulls of warm water or a faucet/hose. Now that the head is done, you repeat the same shampooing steps for the neck, stomach, back, legs, and tail.&nbsp;Once your dog had been completely washed and rinsed off with warm water, you may begin the drying process.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let the dog sit in the bathing area for a few minutes to let the left over water drip off. Then, when the dog is done dripping, grab&nbsp;the towel that you set aside during preparation and drape it over the dogs back. When the towel is in position, put one hand on each side of your dog and begin moving the towel quickly, move and rotate the towel as needed to finnish drying the rest of your dog. When the dog is as dry as it gets, let him/her go off of the leash&nbsp;so that&nbsp;your dag&nbsp;can run wildly with a successful sense of being&nbsp;clean, and&nbsp;also so it can shake off all of the left over water.</font></p>"

"event","<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""2"">Ok, well this was a good essay. You&nbsp;involved the audience in the&nbsp;first sentence by asking a question that every person who read the essay could answer or relate to. The thesis was really good and very well stated.&nbsp;I could really tell you are very passionate about CSI. The supporting information in the opening paragraph was&nbsp;informative and&nbsp;had a good ""hook"". Each of the paragraphs&nbsp;referred back to the&nbsp;introduction which is effective because the reader is continuously reminded&nbsp;of your thesis throughout the paper. However, the transitions are a little rough, meaning&nbsp;moving from&nbsp;paragraph to paragraph&nbsp;is a little choppy and&nbsp;they don't&nbsp;flow well together yet, but with a little work they will be smooth as butter. For example, the last sentence of paragraph&nbsp;2 just leaves the audience hanging and and wondering about the theme song, then&nbsp;your paper immediately&nbsp;jumps straight into websites you found about the show.&nbsp;While they are&nbsp;both related to the thesis,&nbsp;they don't have anything to do with each other. You could try correcting these transition problems by thinking&nbsp;to&nbsp;yourself, ""A paragraph should end leading into the next paragraph."" That will make your paper easier to read with a little bit&nbsp;less confusion. On the other hand, you&nbsp;had great support for your thesis, the website paragraph was&nbsp;quite engaging,&nbsp;I am now interested about this ""CSI Handbook"". Giving off so much background information about the show is good to help the reader understand more about&nbsp;the show, but there are some&nbsp;facts that were unncessary to your&nbsp;paper,&nbsp;for instance,&nbsp;in the&nbsp;fourth paragraph there is a lot of good information about a website you found that is really interesting, i'm not sure all of it is useful in your paper. Also, there could be a little more elaboration on the details that really are strong points in your essay. Other than that, this was a really well-written essay with just a few minor suggestions: to&nbsp;rework the transitions and&nbsp;think more carefully about what is important to the paper,&nbsp;cut out unnecessary details and really elaborate on the key points of your paper. Well done!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>"

Thoughts in Early Winter - Meng Haoran

Trees shed leaves, and geese are flying south;
The north wind blows, here on the river it's cold.
My home is at the bend of the waters of Xiang,
Far beyond the edge of the clouds of Chu.
Travelling, I've exhausted my tears for home,
I watch a lone sail at the heavens' end.
The ferry's gone- who can I ask where?
Darkness falls beside the level sea."

Most of us have never had to fight in wars.  Most of us haven't been faced down by cops in riot gear.  Most of us haven't had dogs set loose on us.
Most of us haven't had our lives, or the lives of our children, threatened.
We have it pretty easy.
But this is our one obligation.  Get up and do it.  Stand in the lines, however long it takes.  Make your voices heard.
Things CAN be different.  Better.  
And Obama is right:  this isn't about him.  It's about YOU.  It's about all of us, together, getting out there and telling the system that we're not going to just sit back and be screwed anymore.  
This is the time.  
OUR time.

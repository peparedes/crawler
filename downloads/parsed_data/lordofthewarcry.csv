Symbol: HURN
Bought: 13.75
Sold: 14.41
Grade: B
Notes: This stock gapped down from the 50s on news of possible accounting fraud.  It very volatile, but moved up pretty strongly from 12.  Sadly I didn't notice it till it was in the mid 13s.  I got in at 13.75.  

It tried for 14 and came off a little then went through 14 strongly.  It took a couple tries for it to get through 14.50 as well.  Then it topped out around 14.75 and started to come back down.  I waited to see whether it would hold 14.50 since that had been a previous congestion area.  As soon as it didn't, I got out with a decent trade.

At the same time I was watching this (before I got in), I was also watching WNC which had moved up and crossed the magic 1 mark to around 1.04.  I only had one trade to make.  HURN was a lot more volatile so I ended up picking it.  WNC topped out around 1.24 before coming off which is a much bigger move percentage wise, so I probably should have played it instead.  One of these days I won't be under PDT and I'll be able to do both.  :-)  Still, it's not a bad thing to only be watching one for the moment.  I can really focus on it that way.  Also, it's never a bad thing to be selective.  There's just times when both opportunities are good."

Grade: C
Notes: There wasn't that much to this trade.  I should have bought when I first noticed it at .18.  If I had then I probably would have made at least a little money on the trade.  Instead I top ticked it at 0.22.  At least when it started to drop I had the good sense to get out immediately with a small loss.

Symbol: LFBG
Bought: 0.063
Sold:   0.061
Grade:  N/A
Notes:  So this was a loss that would have been a gain if it hadn't been for some technical difficulties.  I use Interactive Brokers (IB) and they have 2 trading interfaces, a full-featured Java app called TraderWorkstation (TWS) and a crummy web interface called WebTrader.  Needless to say I use TWS.  

I bought LFBG at 0.063 and it moved up very nicely to 0.070.  I was staring at it wondering if that was all it had in it and it was time to sell and the software stopped working (as in it lost it's connection to the server).  I closed it and tried to reopen.  It wouldn't log in.  I began to panic.  I tried to log in several more times.  I checked my internet connection just to make sure I was connected.  I rebooted my computer and rebooted the wireless router.  All to no avail.  

Then I remembered the web interface and tried to log in.  It wouldn't log in either.  So now I'm really panicking because I have no idea what's happening with that stock.  I went on IB's website looking for support and found they have a support chat service, so I logged in to that and waited for a customer rep.

While I'm waiting I remember I have my work laptop at home so I start that up.  Right as the tech support guy gets on chat I log in to the web interface on my laptop which thankfully seems to work and close the trade for a small loss.  So then I'm chatting with the support guy and he tells me that Verizon has blocked some ports and there are lots of people who have Verizon for an ISP who are having this same problem this morning and I should go talk to them.  He also tells me that the web trading interface doesn't work with Chrome, only IE and Firefox which was why I couldn't get into that on my desktop but could on my laptop.  Okay lesson learned on that one.

So now I'm wondering if Verizon has purposely blocked these ports or if they are having technical difficulties.  I try to log into several different websites and only some of them work.  All google sites seemed to work but LJ and several others didn't.  So I figured it was probably just an outage between some geographical locations in the country or something like that.  This was confirmed when I came home from lunch and everything worked perfectly again.  Stupid Verizon.

When I looked at the chart of LFBG aftwards, 0.070 was indeed its top.  I started coming down fairly slowly after that and I probably would have gotten out at 0.069 or 0.068 if I had been able to.

Takeaways from this experience:
1.  If TWS goes down I can close trades though WebTrader, but only if I use Firefox.
2.  When I have enough money I'll fund several brokerage accounts so that I'm not SOL if one of them stops working.
3.  The market (and circumstances) always works hard to act in such a way as to screw as many people as possible.  Don't be one of those people.  :-)"

"event","So here's my story about attempting to buy an iPhone yesterday.  I showed up at the mall Friday morning about 7:45.  There is both an AT&T store and an Apple store in the mall.  I had previously visited an AT&T store and they had informed me that it would be easier for me to get an iPhone at the Apple store because the AT&T stores would have very limited inventory.

Anyway, so I walked past the 20-person line at the AT&T store and joined the 90-person line at the Apple store (which subsequently turned into about an 120-person line I think).  The Apple folks were very nice, talked to everyone, told us what we had to have with us (credit card, ID, SS#, previous wireless number and password if you were a new AT&T customer and wanted to retain your old number).  They also provided free coffee and bottled water to everyone in line which was nice.  They assured us when I asked that they had MORE than enough iPhones for everyone in the line.  So far, so good.

So I figure I've been in lines at theme parks way longer than this one.  I looked to me like in a theme park this would take about 20 minutes and so I was expecting about an hour's wait after they started.  8:00 arrived and the first group of maybe 5 - 10 people went into the store.  The rest of us waited.... and waited...  40 minutes after the first group had gone in, I decided to give up.  I did have to work that day and I couldn't afford to wait in line until 3:00 in the afternoon.

On my way out I happened to go by the AT&T store which appeared to have just sold out of the 50 or iPhones they had had.  So I could have had one if I had waited in the shorter AT&T line.  :(  Also, the AT&T salesperson kindly informed me that if you have any sort of discount on your account (which I do) that you can't activate at the Apple store anyway.  So even if I had waited forever in the line at the Apple store, I would not have been able to buy the phone there.  Grrrr....

So anyway, reading online what really happened, it appears that Apple did not sufficiently prepare their software system for the flood of people wanting to activate the phone at the same time as the flood of original iPhone users wanting to download the software update that came out on the same day as the new iPhone's release.  Probably the reason that the first group was still in the Apple store when I left was that they were still trying to activate their phones and couldn't.  Apparently the AT&T store was not having as much of a problem because it looked like they had already activated more phones than Apple.  Of course all the AT&T folks had to do was ensure they were activated on AT&T's network; they probably weren't even messing with activating them on the Apple side and just letting people do that at home.

The good news is that I should be able to get an iPhone sometime next week and I'm sure Apple will have their servers up and running strong by then so in the long run it won't be a problem."

"event","Okay and here's another problem.&nbsp; We believe that people should live up to all the light they have and that God will honor them for it.&nbsp; This is typically used to justify those who do not know anything about the Bible or Christianity and yet perhaps they lived up to the best that they knew and so God will honor that as service to Himself and take them to Heaven.

This evening it was brought to my attention that perhaps this concept could be used in the reverse situation though.&nbsp; What if you have someone who truly believes that something is a sin EVEN when it isn't.&nbsp; They are in a more strict or restrictive religious system than God intended.&nbsp; Then they conciously do that thing and so rebel against God.&nbsp; Are they then sinning because they are rebelling even though the thing they do is not a sin?

One's initial reaction is perhaps yes because rebellion against God is in fact sin.&nbsp; However, what if we take the situation farther and say that they are in a completely non-Christian religious setting and they rebel against the god or gods of that setting.&nbsp; Is it sin then?&nbsp; What if they rebel against a heathen diety that is telling them to do something awful?&nbsp; The concept doesn't seem to me to stand up under these types of conditions.&nbsp; Even if they have been trained to think that it is the ""right thing"" to obey this heathen diety, that this is in fact God.&nbsp; Okay you could make the argument that because they recognize the thing as awful they are then following the principle of living up to all the light they have.&nbsp; But what if they disobey the heathen diety in something that is not really awful but rather just arbitrary.&nbsp; What then?

Of course there is the whole question of whether God does in fact in every situation give some indication, be it twinge of concience or something else, what the truly right path is.&nbsp; I think that for all people that ARE still saveable and have not yet been irredeemably lost that God will at SOME point in their lives give them an indication of what the right thing to do really is.&nbsp; I'm not sure I can seriously think that in EVERY bad thing they ever did if they were raised as a heathen that God gave them some indication of what the right thing to do was.&nbsp; Nor can I think that God could accept some of the awful forms of service people make to heathen dieties as proper praise since they knew no better.&nbsp; Rather that at some point in their lives He showed Himself in some way and gave them a choice to accept or deny."

"event","So the story in the OT where God tells Moses ""Ok, these people are bad enough I'm just going to kill them all and make a new nation out of your offspring.""&nbsp; Well Moses argues with God and convinces Him to have mercy on the Israelites and give them another chance.&nbsp; I have heard this story explained away many times by well-meaning people who say that God would never commit genocide and that this was just a test for Moses.&nbsp; 

However, not only do we have quite clear evidence that God *would* in fact commit genocide (look at his commands about the canaanites and other heathen nations the israelites fought in later years), but this denies a clear theme that runs throughout the OT and indeed throughout the whole Bible: that the prayers of righteous people DO in fact make a difference with God.&nbsp; This theme gets stated over and over again throughout countless OT and NT stories (if you can't think of any I can give you a few hints), and I don't think it's necessarily wrong to think that possibly if Moses had agreed with God, God would have done just what He said.

So therefore this leads us to an answer to another <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/fenrah/82115.html"">delima</a>.&nbsp; We do not want God in the OT to be only slightly better than Molech, we want Him to be GOOD and UNCHANGEABLE like He says.&nbsp; But we have genocides or near genocides (oh you are allowed to keep the virgin daughters and marry them and rape them after they have had a month to grieve the family you killed) and things that seem to run counter to the 10 commandments so what do we do?&nbsp; God appears to do things He can do LEGALLY but that are neither just nor merciful.&nbsp; 

And I think the thing we don't recognize here is not that God was only slightly better than Molech but that he was dealing with a people that were only slightly better than Molech.&nbsp; God's wisdom said to wipe them all out and start over again because they were REALLY bad.&nbsp; On the pleas of a truly righteous man God spares them, but He must then deal with them.&nbsp; And unfortunatley He *had* to allow them to do some things (Jesus says divorce was one of them) that were wrong because he couldn't take them from detestable-enough-to-be-worthy-of-genocide-themselves straight to angelic without lots and lots of tiny steps.

Okay so that is not all the answer and there's plenty more to be said on the matter, but that is part of my own personal answer at least.&nbsp; Time for bed now."

"event","The pastor at the Beaverton church today preached about giving to the poor and needy.&nbsp; I thought he did an excellent job, bringing out that when Jesus says ""The poor you will always have among you"" concerning Mary's gift, Jesus was actually referring to some verses in Deuteronomy that talk about giving freely to the poor even when the year of Jubilee (and debt cancellation) is just around the corner.

Anyway, though, he started the sermon off with some statistics about the world, you know the kind that start off, ""If there were just 100 people in the world here is how they would look, 52 would be women, 48 would be men, etc., etc., etc.""&nbsp; However, he said one minute that 30 would be white and 70 would not be, then he said in the next sentence that 61 would be asian, 13 african, etc.&nbsp; Now if you do the math, 61 + 13 + ... = 74+ which is more than the previous 70.&nbsp; I *assume* that he got his statistics from separate sources, one referring to actual geographical locations (a large part of Russia is in Asia and is white for example) and one to actual racial groups (white and non-white).&nbsp; Or on the other hand he could have just been confused; I dunno.&nbsp; I tend to think that pastors who want to use a lot of numbers in their sermons ought to get someone to proofread for them that actually understands numbers, but that's a little cynical I know.&nbsp; The rest of the sermon was quite good so I'm not really complaining though."

"event","So I was reading the first chapter of Mark this morning and it mentions what was apparently the first leper to come to Jesus for healing.&nbsp; Jesus tells the man (as He told so many people He healed) not to tell anyone about it.&nbsp; Of course the leper disobeyed that request and ""began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around, to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but stayed out in unpopulated areas.""

Now I usually have thought this was because so many people were mobbing Jesus that He couldn't get into a city.&nbsp; However another reason occured to me that I think makes more sense.&nbsp; Perhaps the reason Jesus asked the leper not to tell and the reason He then couldn't go into the cities was because He had touched a leper.&nbsp; I mean people weren't normally allowed even to approach lepers since the disease was so contageous and is it not possible that the cities barred Jesus from entering because they were afraid He would spread disease into their walls?

Then the passage continues with the really amazing part that ""they were coming to Him from everywhere.""&nbsp; Despite the fact that people, especially city officials were afraid of Jesus entering their walls, He continued to draw people from all around to hear the message and receive the healing.&nbsp; Really amazing I must say.

Then again this still doesn't answer the general question of why Jesus asked some people not to tell about how He had healed them and yet commisioned others to do exactly that.&nbsp; I think the question bears to have some more study on each individual circumstance in which Jesus made a request one way or the other."

I have been studying up on my PHP at B&N for a job interview that is hopefully upcoming this next week.&nbsp; I think I will call the company tomorrow if I don't hear back from them since it has been a week since my phone interview and I would like to know whether they plan on personally interviewing me or not.

Thursday - Sunday Abbie and I are headed to Seattle to visit our cousin and her husband for Thanksgiving!&nbsp; She sent us an e-mail telling us about all the things she was going to make and, let me tell you, if she makes half that stuff it's going to be a meal worth remembering.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Anyway, happy veggie bird day to all!"

"event","Well today after I had corrected my stupidity with dates (my sister gets here a day later than I had thought so I had to change our hotel and bullet train reservations which turned out to be much less trouble than my panicy mind at first imagined).&nbsp; Anyway, as I was saying AFTER I had corrected my stupid mistake which ended up costing us no extra money, I celebrated by going out and spending money!&nbsp; Horray!

I went to see the new Naruto movie which hit the Japanese theatres a couple weeks ago. <lj-cut text=""Almost completely spoiler free impressions""> Now the first Naruto movie was okay, but not spectacular, so I didn't hold out real high hopes for the 2nd one.&nbsp; Still, I'm in Japan, and I might as well take advantage of my only ever lifetime opportunity to see Naruto on the big screen (unless I visit here in 2006 when the next one comes out).&nbsp; My expectations were just about spot on.&nbsp; While of course I could only understand some bits of the dialogue, I still got most of the plot just fine, which was a pretty tired affair involving ancient alien technology and some crazy guy wanting to take over the world (or destroy it or just become super powerful; wasn't too clear on that).&nbsp; In typical Naruto fashion, the villian was quite evil, but his underling was a much more empathetic character (won't tell you what happens to him in the end though).&nbsp; Similar to the first movie, the animation was not up to the quality of the TV series, although this time around, the characters were mostly animated by hand on top of really badly done CG backgrounds which was even worse than the first movie I think.&nbsp; Also, it appeared that the writers and animators reached their time deadline about half way through the movie, so the 2nd half was definitely inferior to the beginning and the ending was prettty dumb which was also not unexpected from the first movie.

Still, it did have its redeeming qualities.&nbsp; It had a heavy dose of Gaara for example, who was as scary-cool as ever (I was hoping for just a little more of him in the last few scenes I'll admit but he had his share of the spot light).&nbsp; There were also a number of pretty well done fight scenes, which were fun to watch.&nbsp; They kept the cast pretty small so we got to see everyone show their moves (Sakura, Naruto, Shikamaru, Gaara, and Kankuro were the only regular Naruto characters present).&nbsp; Naruto had his signature moves although nothing too special (where on earth has his giant frog summoning gone?&nbsp; He hasn't used that in forever in either the anime or manga!).&nbsp; </lj-cut>

A note of interest on Japanese theatres for those who have never been to one.&nbsp; First they are quite expensive ($17 is the normal price although women on Wednesdays and everyone on the first day of the month and children all cost $9 and sometimes you can find discount tickets at the convenience stores).&nbsp; Second, people are extremely quiet and polite.&nbsp; The theatre I was in today was stuffed full of elementary school kids and they were quiet as mouses through the whole movie, which would never ever happen in the US.&nbsp; Thirdly, seats are usually (but as I found today not always) assigned.&nbsp; And finally people sit through the entire credit role generally without making a sound or moving a muscle to leave (well I suppose if you have to pay so darned much you want to get as much as possible out of the thing right?).&nbsp; Anyway, it is definitely a nicer experience, albeit a more expensive one, than US theatres are.&nbsp; Oh and the theatres are generally cleaner too.&nbsp; Oh and for American movies, you usually have the choice between Japanese subbed or dubbed, which is nice for all us who want to hear our movies in English (needless to say this choice is not available for Japanese movies like Naruto)."

Anyway, there are a lot of houses and apartments along this route, but I think the most cats I've ever seen out was maybe 2.&nbsp; Tonight I saw at least 7 and maybe more.&nbsp; And they weren't all in one area either, they were scattered all along the entire route.&nbsp; They were all well fed looking and some had collars so I'm fairly certain they were all owned by people.&nbsp; But they were all out on the road or side walk, and they all seemed, well, kind of agitated.&nbsp; A couple were friendly and let me pet them or followed me a little way down the street.&nbsp; But even those didn't act relaxed like a cat might who is sitting out in front of its own house on a quiet night.

I tried to see if there was a full moon tonight, but I couldn't tell.&nbsp; You can't often see the moon in Tokyo because of the clouds and smog and tall buildings all around.&nbsp; Tonight was too cloudy.&nbsp; Maybe The Big One is about to hit Tokyo and topple all those skyscrapers and sink part of it into the sea.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; Maybe it was all a coincidence, but it did seem awfullly strange...."

Well first I had to stop at the English school to get the room number and I met some of our students' moms out front.&nbsp; They asked me what I was doing and I explained what the flowers were for.&nbsp; Then they very hesitantly and tactfully told me that that was a very bad idea.&nbsp; Apparently potted flowers for someone in the hospital are a big no no in Japan because the fact that the flower will live for a long time symbolizes a long stay in the hospital.&nbsp; Also, yellow flowers have some association with funerals and are also a big no no for hospital patients.&nbsp; Two strikes and I'm out.

Of course the gracious mothers made it very clear that the lady would understand since I am a foreigner and not to worry about it, but after knowing I just couldn't do it.&nbsp; Fortunately the flowers weren't at all expensive, but I didn't have time to go and get more flowers and make the hospital visit and make it to class after that so I had to give up on it for today.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll get around to trying again tomorrow.

"event","You know I think some of the most interesting livejournal entries, those that spark the longest and most interesting conversations, are those made about various intellectual subjects, religious or philosophical generally, which can easily by disagreed with or which ask for opinions on interesting topics.&nbsp; I love reading and commenting on these types of posts, which most often seem to come up on <lj user=""davidlurie"">'s and <lj user=""erunion"">'s journals (thanks guys!).

However, despite the fact that I find these types of entries most interesting, I hardly ever post such entries myself.&nbsp; I wonder why that is sometimes.&nbsp; Of course it's not really much different with real life conversations; I like having long involved conversations about things like that, but I rarely start such conversations.&nbsp; Maybe one reason is that I am generally a defender of orthodoxy (well SDA orthodoxy at any rate), and a lot of my opinions tend to fall basically in line with what one might consider orthodox SDA theology.&nbsp; Maybe another reason is that I already know what I think about a lot of things, and I don't tend to share my opinions unless someone asks for them which is not that often (no one is disliked as much as the guy who can't shut up with his opinions about everything).

Usually when I prepare for a Bible study or for teaching the Sabbath school lesson, my preparation notes tend to look like a long list of scripture passages with a long list of questions indented under each passage.&nbsp; Some of those questions I think I have good answers too (although the questions are never rhetorical or stupid-simple like the SS lesson's often are) and some I don't.&nbsp; I like to teach that way; by asking my students what I see as the hardest questions I can think of about a particular passage.&nbsp; The questions don't always have good answers, but that makes it all the more interesting.&nbsp; Maybe I just need to start posting some of those questions from my Bible classes on Livejournal.&nbsp; Often times though, one really needs to have read the whole book up to a particular point (and sometimes even the whole book after that point) to provide intelligent commentary on questions like that.&nbsp; Anyway, maybe I'll try that sometime.&nbsp; Sorry for such a rambling entry, have a good day all!"

"event","Recently I watched the third (hopefully last) in the new star wars series.&nbsp; Well I can say that I definitely liked it better than the abysmal Episode II, but not as much as I liked Episode I (or any of the old star wars movies for that matter).&nbsp; It does run into the same problems that I've had with all of the new movies though, namely that they hire no name actors who couldn't pull off saying a line naturally to save their lives, and the lines aren't that great to begin with.&nbsp; I mean one of the big attractions in the older movies was having Han Solo (oooo Harrison Ford!) making smart remarks all the time.&nbsp; The new movies unfortunately have no actors with such abilities (either humor wise or acting wise).&nbsp; Anyway, though, it wasn't that bad; I did enjoy it, especially towards the end when you got to see how all the loose ends shape up the way that they would start in the old series.&nbsp; I'll have to go back and watch some of the older ones again one of these days."

"event","You know there's something I can't figure out.&nbsp; People seem to like to have me around when I'm there.&nbsp; And they certainly want me around if there's something they want someone to speak up for them about.&nbsp; But when they want to go out and have fun, they never invite me.&nbsp; I love to go out and do stuff just as much as the next guy, but people just don't want me around when they want to have fun.&nbsp; Life is lonely."

<b>1. What would you do if your next-door neighbours had a vociferous and incessant peacock? Would you do it with a gun, knife, or poison?</b>

Colonel Mustard in the Drawing Room with the Candlestick of course.&nbsp; :-P

<b>2. In what way(s) are you most like Hatake Kakashi?</b>

Hmmm, I'm usually fairly even keel as far as my mood goes.&nbsp; I very rarely get mad, but when I do, fear me!&nbsp; :->

<b>3. Reality: a relatively unimportant intrusion or a good place to be? Why?</b>

Reality is a good place to be because true reality is where God is.

<b>4. Have you ever eaten sushi icecream? If not, would you try it?</b>

LOL!&nbsp; No I have not, but if it was veggie then yeah I'd try it! I think it would be nasty, but I'd at least try it.&nbsp; :-)

<b>5. What do you most like and dislike about SDA culture, and why are you still in the church?</b>

Hmmm, that's a tough one, especially since right now I am living in a different SDA culture (namely Japanese SDA culture).&nbsp; I suppose your question is referring to American SDA culture.&nbsp; The thing I most dislike:&nbsp; the opposition of ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" parties within the church.&nbsp; I'm not saying I favor either side; I'm saying I dislike the fact that there are sides at all.&nbsp; There shouldn't be, although that sort of division seems inevitable sometimes.&nbsp; Divisions like that do a great disservice to God's work in my opinion.&nbsp; Thing I most like:&nbsp; the fact that, despite a lot of complacence and deadweight, there is still an emphasis on mission in many parts of SDA culture.&nbsp; You don't find it everywhere, but there are still a lot of great people who are interested in doing God's work."

"event","Well I am not the sort of SDA who will cry ""End of time!"" everytime the stock market takes a dip.&nbsp; However, there are some rather grim consequences to the recently passed Real ID act.&nbsp; There's an interesting article on it <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050509-4886.html?60828&91362"">here</a>.&nbsp; Basically the gist is that the act sets aside the Constitutional right of judicial review for actions taken by Homeland Security in certain situations.&nbsp; Not that there's such a likelihood that judicial review will be needed in those circumstances, but if one side of the system of checks and balances can so easily prevent itself from being checked or balanced, it may bode ill in the future."

"event","Well I've been trying to avoid it, but this quiz has surfaced on so many of my friends' blogs that I have finally given in to peer pressure.&nbsp; However I don't think the result will be comprehensible to most of you, but here goes.

1. Grab the nearest book.

2. Open the book to page 123.

3. Find the fifth full sentence.

4. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.

5. Don't search around for the coolest book you can find. Use what's actually nearest to you.

The book is my new copy of the Bible in Japanese and it's Exodus 18:2-3 (conveniently put into Roomaji for those who can't read kana and kanji:

""Moose no shuu to etoro wa, moose ga saki ni kaeshte ita tsuma no shipora to, futari no musuko o tsurete kita.""

For the benefit of those of you who might want to know what those verses say, here it is from the NIV:

""2 After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her 3 and her two sons."""

They also really like pickles.&nbsp; And they pickle everything from radishes to carrots to sour plums.&nbsp; Pickles are a very traditional food with Japanese people, while I'm not sure about mayo; it was probably brought here a long time ago by early europeans.&nbsp; Anyway, whatever the origin it is here to stay."

"event","Top 3 reasons why Japanese people are wimps:

1.&nbsp; They go to the hospital at the drop of a hat.&nbsp; Literally, they do.&nbsp; ""You have a headache today?&nbsp; Oh why don't you go to the hospital?""&nbsp; I mean they go to the hospital for everything.

2.&nbsp; They are obsessed with things that might be dangerous.&nbsp; I mean so much so that they have told me that I ought to turn off the water to my washing machine, my hot water heater, and the gas to my stove when I'm not using them ""just in case.""&nbsp; I have been lectured by grade school children about how the game we were playing was not safe enough.&nbsp; Good grief.

3.&nbsp; They are afraid to try new things.&nbsp; I mean I have met people who had never in their lives talked to a foreigner (either Japanese-speaking or otherwise) and they were terrified of even talking to me, despite the fact that I was talking to them in Japanese.&nbsp; One would think that a country that is on the cutting edge of producing the newest technology every year would be willing to try new things as individuals.&nbsp; However, such is most definitely not the case.&nbsp; They like to do things like they 've always done them and never rock the boat.

So as you can see, Japanese people are most definitely wimps.&nbsp; No matter what you might watch on anime or read about as far as historical samurai go, trust me on this one; they are wimps.&nbsp; :-)"

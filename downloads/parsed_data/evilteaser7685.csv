"event","<p>One of my New Years resolutions was to write more. I love writing, but I never do it. Part of the reason is that I feel embarrassed of my writing. I like to do it when I'm alone. I don't know what I'm embarrassed of. I guess I feel silly keeping a diary or journal, but I really don't know why. I would also like to do more creative writing. That's where I really get embarrassed and I am not too sure why. I don't necessarily mean I have to write in this every day, but I either want to write in my journal, or in a real notebook. I need to read and write more. </p><p>Anyway. 2014. Off to a lazy start. I was hung over so I couldn't do much. We were just lazy. Well we made home fries and eggs for breakfast and then watched like five hours of Best Ink because a marathon was on. Really good/addictive show. Anyway I felt bad because Ali wanted to get out of the house. She doesn't like sitting around, so we were going to go to the movies, but honestly I just felt like hell so we stayed in. She's so good to me. It was nice to just cuddle all day. </p><p>So I just wanted to make sure I got in some form of writing to stay true to my goals for myself. I'm really excited. We are going to try going gluten free, we got a recipe book for Xmas from Ali's brother with all gluten free recipes so we made one last night. It was ok. Another other things I want to do are really exercise, cut down on sugar, and meditate every day if possible. We are going to see Brian Weiss on March 8 and I really am so excited but I want to be able to actually have an experience so I need to practice!!! That's all for tonight!!!</p>"

"event","So. Things are going awesome. Almost completely moved into the apartment. Carpet will be in this week... cable and internet done on Wed, stove got fixed today. By the end of the week we will be completely set. Now I just have to pack my stuff which I haven't done yet! HA. But we've slept there the past two nights. We have the 2 tvs up there, one dvd player, the wii, and some clothes. Bought a cute shower curtain the other day and a new bed spread and microwave which we are going to need to upgrade because its only 700 watts and everything needs like a minimum of 1100. Its fine for now though. We are going to bring Jasper (kitty) up when the carpet is installed. And Wed. gotta finish painting. Its all coming together nicely though. I am veryyyyy excited. Only thing that will suck is this sharing one car business so our next endeavor is finding Amanda a car. No big tho.. we can do it.

I found a lady to take allllll five of my babies. I am reallly happy she wants all of them I didn't want to separate them from each other. I am supposed to meet up with her tomorrow and give them away. I just sent her pics with their names and a little thing about each of them. It made me sad but I know its best for them. And she has had ferrets for a long time and is retired so has plenty of time for them and knows all the responsibility they entail. I feel bad because I just have not paid enough attention to them these past few months. So that will be good. Then I just gotta clean up my room at Grandma's.

Right now I gotta grab some pots and pans and dvds to bring up tonight. Had to stop here to feed the kitty face boy. I can't wait til he's up there with us, even though he is evil I love him.

So that is all. Life is awesome right now, I am really happy. One year ago, I would've never ever have guessed this is where'd I'd be in life. Wow how much things can chance in only one year.

"event","AH. So here I am at work again. Being the worst nanny ever just sitting on my computer lol. I have to cook pancakes for Micaela soon but I just wanted to update first. So I was going to get rid of my ferrets before I moved into Jessica's but today when I went onto craigslist and started e-mailing ppl explaining my ferrets I got really sad thinking about giving them away. I think we are going to keep them but at the same time its like ugghhhh they are so much work. But I love them. Really whats making me sad is thinking about separating them from each other cuz I know they won't miss me much I've been a really crappy owner the past few months. Poor things barely ever come out of the cage. But once we move I will def. take perfect care of them cuz I don't want the place to smell like ferrets. I just gotta find a new cage for them, cages are just so freakin' expensive. And I just don't want them to poop everywhere but maybe I can try to litter train them again. Ughhhh I dunno. I found someone who wants to take Dexter and Max but oh man those are the two sweetest onessss. AH I JUST DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT.

Freakin' pets... 

The psychic fair is going to be in Milford and Shelton this weekend and I want to go so badddd. I shouldn't though, I should save my money but its been so long since I went. I really want to find out what to do about my career... or get some sort of guidance cuz last time the lady said she did not see me working with kids anymore. I wonder what she saw me doing. I just want to get onto some career path so I'm not stuck being a nanny forever. All right well thats it I guess I'm gonna go cook some pancakes and put away laundry, oh joy.

"event","So I haven't updated in almost a whole year. That may be the longest hiatus I've ever taken from this. It's so weird because I made like 2 new ""secret"" journals but parting with this one just doesn't seem right since I've had it since I was 15. I just spend like an hour reading my old entries which always make me laugh and feel a bit nostalgic. And sometimes make me think what an idiot I used to be.

I am really excited for my life right now. Everything is going pretty well. Amanda and I are moving into our apartment sometime within the next week, I think we are bringing the bed up Friday so we will prob start sleeping there asap. I'm glad we don't have to do all of our moving in one freakin' day and we can spread it over the next few weeks, but it shouldn't be too bad. Just bringing the bed up and the big tv will be the two hardest parts. And when we get a couch I am making sure that shit is delivered so I don't have to be trying to bring that up the stairs. Heavy lifting is not for Kerri.

So I say this every time I update randomly but I really want to start updating more regularly again because I love to look back after a few years and see what was going on in my life at specific periods of time. I can't believe I've had this thing for so freakin' longggg.

I am at work right now and so bored because I've been here since 9:00 am, but at least I get to leave around 6:30 tonight I think. I don't even mind that its like longer hours because that means more moolah. Ever since they changed my pay to hourly instead of salary the long days don't seem as long. And this week is good cuz I only have one kid to watch as opposed to having both of them here. Domenic is in CA with his dad this week so its just me and Micaela and she is so good. Well, sometimes.. heh. 

Anyway I guess thats it for now. I am just so excited to move in with Amanda. Life is looking up and I am happier than I've been in a while, and SO in love with someone who actually loves me back. Its really a great feeling. :D KK thats all for now lata!

anyway.
i guess i just hate saying ""this is my life, i did this and this and that, and i want to do this and that, but i have no money so i cant do anythin"" haha.
starting tomorrow i wont be sleeping at my own house again until sunday night. diana and michael (my current employers) are both away in florida and i get the pleasure of caring for the children. im getting a lil jipped on pay kinda but whatever its still and extra 800 bucks this week.
see. and now ive updated for 2 minutes and dont feel like it anymore. its so boring.

"event","Man. I need to write, and keep writing. SO much has happened in the past month I didn't even realize, until I went to therapy Friday and was talking about the past month.
I didn't go for a month. But anyway. 
Obviously the first major thing that happened was Kayla's random ass sickness. It started like 2 1/2 weeks ago. The day before we left for camping.
Anyway, lately she's been feeling better now kind of. The doctor said something might be wrong in her GI tract but now that she's been on the birth control for over a week it seems like she's feeling better. So its hard to tell. It sucks cuz she doesn't have health insurance. 
So that leads to the next major decision and thats that Kayla is going to start another job. She's going to work at a pet store in Norwalk. Its a little sucky because she'll be making a little less money but in the end its better because she'll have health insurance, has the chance to get promotions (and apparently if you are good they promote you fast) and overall she'll be happier because she loves animals. Not that she doesn't love Sophie and all but they take too much advantage of her and its too hard for her to deal with all day. 
Maybe one day she can have own store. That would be sweet. 
Also I'm starting school next Monday (the 28th) which I cannot even believe. It's been about 3 years since I've attempted college again (for those who don't know this will be my 3rd time, and 3rd time is a charm!) and I'm going to do it through the University of Phoenix online courses. I think it'll be better for me. Actually getting myself to GO to class was always my major problem, and I'm always on my computer anyway. I'm really excited because I actually know what I want to do now, and obviously I'm more mature and willing to learn things. I am really excited I can't wait. I wish I was starting tomorrow and not in another week. AND on top of it all I don't have to pay anything.
ALSO we got 2 new ferrets. Yeah yeah yeah I hear it already. Whatever. I dunno why people think its such a big deal. We had 4 anyway, and they were discounted lol because we got them from Kayla's brother. Their names are Maddi and Colbie. CUTE!
What else what else. 
Kayla is painting the bedroom right now lol. Its a nice gray color, AND we are getting new carpetting in the bedroom on Thursday because our old carpet got ruined from our old AC unit it like leaked. And we got a new AC last Thursday. SO much NEW stuff going on. So Kayla has been painting all day by herself. I hate painting and she loves it so its all good.
Plus I cleaned the whole house basically. I borrowed moms vacuum and vacuumed the living room kitchen and hallway it needed it bad because our stupid vacuum sucks (no pun intended.. ok a little haha) and I cleaned the kitchen floor like scrubbed it, did all the dishes, and cooked dinner. It was delicious.
I'm also really happy because we are already halfway through the summer program at work which means 3 more weeks of work then on vaca for just about 3 weeks. Which is always exciting. And a chance to make extra money.
Life is just great lately. Me and Kayla are happier than ever, its almost our one year anniversary of moving in here (which I cannot even believe) and things just keep looking up. 
Kayla's parents are looking to move back up here too which is awesome. She will be really happy, and me too! I love her parents. Especially her mommy. 
HM. 
YAY! I dunno I'm just happy and thankful. Life's been really great to us lately. 
OKIE DOKIE PEACE OUT!

"event","Its the last day of vacation!!!
Tomorrow is back to work. But it won't be bad at all, I just hope its not nastily hot outside. 
I had fun this vacation. Just chilled mostly.
Yesterday me n Kayla were both like in a bad mood in the morning because I think I was experiencing some sort of cabin fever since I was like in my house Wed, Thurs, and Fri without really going anywhere. 
So we decided to go to Target because for some reason all of her shirts have weird random stains on them which we don't understand why, and we have 70 bucks for target because we had overpaid on our credit card so we went n got the credit card from dads and went shopping. 
She got cute stuff. Then we decided to go swimming at Mimi's.
It was fun, Mim and Peg came out to the pool with us and we were just talking, gossiping and it was really fun. We were there for like 5 hours. 
We went inside and were talking. She told us the funniest story about the lil 13 year old girl being a whore and giving blow jobs in the garage and Mimi caught her.
Then Meg and Zac came over and we watched some episodes of Weeds. I LOVE that show!
I got drunk by myself which is a little depressing but still fun. We went to bed after they left it was mad late.
We brought our mattress into the living room because we can't use the AC in our room anymore since it seems to be leaking pretty badly and made our carpet soaking wet and I'm afraid to look under it... 
So we slept in the living room on our high ass mattress because we put it on the futon so its like the highest mattress ever. It was fun.
Slept til like 2:15 though, I just couldn't wake up it was so nice to sleeeep.
Anyway later on Meg is coming over to finish up the 3rd season of weeds so we can all watch the new one together tomorrow. I really don't mind that we have to go back to work because its shorter days and more money and more laid back and I miss all the kids. And there's always some crazy drama going on there so it keeps it interesting. 
And in 6 weeks I'll be on vacation again!

PEACE.

"event","im so sad. i knew we were getting our new phones today. and i was home all day. i left for 15 minutes. and of course in that 15 minutes the delivery guy comes and im not home so we dont get our phones!!! i mean i know well just get them tomorrow or tonight but the point is i could have been charging my sexy new phone right now. grrrrrrrrrrrrr. its so frustrating that that happened. or that i cant go pick them up until 6:00 pm. im happy to be getting a new phone at all, esp since i wasn't expecting to be getting a new phone until december but still.
also i had to go apply for a personal loan at peoples bank so i could hopefully use it for school. its sooooo stupid because im not considered an independent student until i am 24 so since my parents don't want to do a PLUS loan this is pretty much my only option because otherwise i basically can't go. but the thing is i might get a lot of money from a pell grant but i wont get that til after my classes start. so ill have to use my personal loan to pay for the classes, then hopefully ill get the grant and then can use that to pay off the loan and still hopefully have like 1000 extra bucks for whatever the fuck i wanna use it for. for some reason im irrationally upset about missing the phones. its just because before i left i was thinking that i hoped that they didnt come while i was gone, and then i thought of course they wont i wont be gone that long. and then i come home and they came! and thast all i was waiting for all day because IM SO FUCKING BORED OUT OF MY GODDAMN mind. im pmsing definitely. because ive been really happy and positive lately and the past 3 days i have not been in a great mood. ugh....

im gonna smoke a blunt n watch a movie or something to lift my spirits. im lonely and bored and sick of the same thing every damn day."

But now I just downloaded it so hopefully I will update more. 
I've been feeling SO happy lately:):):)
I have to go to Lois's birthday party today it should be all right.
But what I'm really excited for is after the party because me and Kayla are going to celebrate our anniversary tonight :).
3 years!
It's insane. But at the same time its like I feel like I've been with her/known her longer than 3 years. But then when you really sit down and think about it A LOT of stuff happens in 3 years so it is a pretty long time.
Its still crazy though. And it feels like we never even broke up, which is good. I'm glad we aren't one of those couples who broke up a million times and keep getting back together. I mean it happened once but I feel like once or 2x throughout a lifelong relationship is normal. And really.. only 4 months but technically like 2 months.
ANYWAY! I'm excited because after the party we are going to take a walk on the beach and then go eat at 99 then go to the movies. Grace got everyone a 20 dollar gift certificate to the movies so I'm really excited to go lol. We are gonna see Sex and The City. I never really watched the show but whateva. Kayla wants to see it I'm sure I'll enjoy it.
Then tomorrow we got nothin to do except maybe visit Kayla's grandparents and then I'm gonna go to Liz's birthday party. It should be fun.
I'm so happy I'm on vacation!!! WHOO HOO!
Life is wonderful. Anyway, I'm gonna go now I gotta get ready soon.
Peace :)

Our vet told us to just give her water and pedia lyte and baby food. We gave her baby food and she ate it very willingly out of the syringe. The only problem is she doesn't seem to eat unless we are feeding her, but even then its not force feeding she licks it. Anf she drinks her water too. But this is like the third time she is sick and she has an apt. at 9 am she is just scaring us. She's wobbling around and keeps pooping so much blood. :'(. This is really sad I hope she makes it through the night. If there is anything we can do please let me know.

I hate this mood I'm in because I can't explain it and when I try to I can't and I'm just mad. And I feel like I don't have anyone in my life I really want to vent about the things that are bugging me to because no one is Myk. And Myk was my best friend in the world and he is the only person I feel like I could just tell anything to about how I'm feeling and he will truly understand. And he doesn't give me the annoying advice that everyone else would, because lets face it, its advice I could clearly give myself, he tells me how he sees it and tells me straight up what I need to hear. Or if he knew I didn't wanna hear anything he would just listen and then vent about his own problem. I miss our friendship IMMENSELY. Oh well nothing I could do about that.
I wish I could express my feelings better. My body feels exhausted right now. I just feel kind of like a zombie. A lot of things are bugging me. I'm sick of my life and being fucking bored and poor all the time. It's really getting very old. Fuck.

"event","hey so yet again i fail at updating this often enough.
so we got another little ferret the other day. hes freakin cute. tiny tiny little guy. i like him his name is max... he's fun. izzy is doin pretty good with him but i think she's still a little like ehh... she gets territorial over her stuff and places in the house that she thinks are ""hers"" haha. its cute. but they play and cuddle together.
no work for the past 2 days because i had a death migraine and then was throwing up all night last night. im so pissed because ive already used 4 sick days. oh well. just gonna try not to call out unless i absolutely have to like these past 2 days. i just cant seem to stay healthy.
so me n kayla kinda rearranged the bedroom and took the dresser out of the closet and put the fish tank on top of it. it looks sooooo much better in here. she also hung up that yellow stuffed animal things i have... i cant explain it but its like this long thing u hang from the ceiling and different compartments u put stuffed animals in and its made out of like mesh. those 2 things make the room look so much better and plus i cleaned and did ALL of the laundry (believe me there was ... A LOT) and got rid of all the old towels. then i vacuumed and stuff so the floor is completely clean except for the furniture and it gives me the feeling of my old rooms that i used to have at my parents house. and kayla got that feeling too so we're happy. we just have to paint the ugly green bookcase cuz it doesn't match at all.
There's no food in the house really at all besides like bread and eggs and cupcakes... its really depressing and i have no money at all to buy food lol so it really sucks right now. Hopefully I'll have money leftover from my check Wednesday to get food. It sucks cuz I haven't been working with Chris at his house much so its like without that I'm pretty much screwed. I'm just so busy now I have no time unless I work super long days. Maybe getting this place was not the smartest idea but... I dunno. It's okay I know it'll be fine I'm being a little dramatic. I'll just have to suck it up and work more, its okay because when I do the long days they go by pretty quick because I like Chris a lot so that helps ya know lol.
I finally got to do the dishes the sink was overflowing for like more than a week, Kayla did about half if not more the other day but there was still a lot. Actually its not even that much its just that the counter/sink area is so damn tiny that any clutter at all looks bad. But I got them done so its much more pleasant to look in the kitchen now. Everything is clean for the most part so I'm happy. Next we have to tackle the closet, the bathroom and just little things in the living room. We're almost settled. I mean it'll take a while. Still need a real couch... we have no kitchen table or chairs or anything but there's really not room for a table and I dunno if we'd eat at it much anyway.
I really wish we could get a tiny portable dishwasher that just hooks up to our sink. If we could save some money we could get it cuz it's not that much.
I guess thats it for now this got kinda long. Peace.

Saturday night had a little party played some beer pong, got a little... wasted to say the least haha. Our house almost burned down!! A pizza box was on top of the stove and I guess someone hit it with their back by accident and turned the burner on (its a gas stove) and it was like on fire. I was on the phone being drunk and I walked into the kitchen n saw flames around the pizza box I was like HMM NOT GOOD! So I turned off the burner and don't really remember, I think I put the pizza box in the sink but it was like overflowing with stuff so we couldn't get water and the flames were just getting so high and attacking Kayla, and I left the room cuz it was too stressful for me ha. Anthony ended up throwing soda on it I think and saving the day. Fun times though. I guess your place isn't your place for real until something catches on fire. HA. So now its Monday... I gotta go back to work on Thursday :(. Its okay actually not that bad lol its just been nice doing oh you know nothing. Well that's not true either I have been working with Chris a lot I think I'll get a total of like 40 hours this week with him at home which means like 800 dollar check for me next month :) Yay. Thats like an extra 2 paychecks for the month. Well thats it for now I have to go because I still have to get dressed and brush my teeth then drive to Chris's house. I'll be back later n possibly update some more.

I worked 2 days at home with Chris, and then he went away with his family for the weekend so I dunno when they'll be back. I wanna work a lot this week though because I need the money. There's not much else to write about I guess. I'm just chillin. Today was a laid back day, we got a coffee table and end tables too and a new tv stand. All for free which is exciting. Everything is slowly coming together. Anyway I guess that's my update for now, I'm feelin' pretty tired. G'night.

"event","WOW
So I was just laying in bed about to fall asleep when I started thinking about how good my money situation is about to get. I definitely need a second job and have been thinking about getting one really bad. I really wanted it to be either babysitting or working with children at home or something because really its what I love doing and now that I do it I don't wanna do anything else!! So Friday at school was our ""Spring Fling"". It was cute, all the kids got dressed up and the gym was decorated and the parents got to come if they wanted. It was really fun. Chris' parents came and I was talking to them for the whole time basically and they asked me at the end of the dance if I was interested in either babysitting or working at home with Chris and I basically said ""HELL YEAH!"" without ya know saying hell yeah. So I told them I would write my number in the book (we write in a notebook everyday to the parents and they write us everyday [hopefully] too) and Chris' dad (John) whipped out his cell phone and said what's your number, and asked me what I was doing this weekend and it ended up that I went over to Chris' today. It was awesome. I went there at 12 and stayed til about 2:15. They showed me around the house (HUGE!) and the yard and basically told me to do whatever I want with Chris because its better than him just doing nothing. So Chris and I played a game, bounced the ball a bit, and did some puzzles and lacing. So heres the part about my life becoming amazing. Chris' dad came to talk to me and told me I'd be getting paid 20 dollars an hour for now and if I work more then I'll probably get paid more. 20 dollars an hour is amazing. They also basically told me I could come whenever I want and if I ever had to cancel its really no big deal and all this awesome stuff. I get paid once a month, which is cute because that's a huge amount at once. So what I'd really like to do is work 8 hours on the weekends (4 on Saturday, 4 on Sunday) and then maybe 4 during the week. Since Chris has inclusion on Tuesdays and Thursdays I figured maybe I can just go to his house from like 3-5 on Tues. and Thurs. that would be fucking awesome. I'll talk to his parents but honestly that would be beautiful. I was calculating if I work just 12 hours a week at his house and if I did that would be 960 extra bucks a month. A THOUSAND DOLLARS EXTRA A MONTH! OMG I don't think I can even comprehend that. SO yes, as I was just about to fall asleep I realized that and became overwhelmed with joy and started calculting on my phone how much money a month I'd be making and figuring out bills and wow. Just truly wow, esp. since my mom is paying off my credit card bills for me OMG! I can save so much money and put so much extra money towards my car. I figured like maybe one month I can pay like a thousand dollars to my car and the next save a thousand or something like that. Can you imagine??? OMG and then by next summer I'd definitely be able to get my own place, even before that, but if I could hold off til next summer I could pay a lot more off on my car which would be great. And also I might do the after school program in the summer which is 2 hours extra on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and its only until 3 (because school is only til 1 in the summer) and thats also 20 bucks an hour. OMG! Honestly my heart is like going crazy because I feel really happy. Even if I only worked 8 hours a week at Chris' house I'd make so much more money. Well over 2 grand a month. I'm really at this point where I want to work work work to make me some money so I can get out on my own. I'm more than ready. I'm so thrilled. This is honestly like my dream job. When I went to the psychic a year ago she told me I'd find my dream job really soon and it'd be with children. Holy shit right. OMG I am just so happy. I hope it really ends up being how I want it to be. I would love to be able to pay so much off on my car and save so much damn money up. I really want to budget everything and save save save. Okay anyway... thats enough I had to let it outsomewhere!!! GOOD NIGHT ! :)"

"event","yo i got the urge to update n i havent in a while so might as well. havent been up to much lately just workin and chillin after work. mostly my days look like this -- wake up, work, go home for a minute, go to the beach or some spot to park and smoke, get subway or some kinda food, go back to the beach, come home, smoke go to bed lol. its okay though because im having fun and im out a lot. the weather is just too beautiful to not go outside. even if im just sittin in the car i still got the windows down n im still outside not sitting in here on my computer. i love this weather so much. july was always my favorite month but i think may is now. its just always really nice in may its when it gets warm again and i love it. and the sun makes me so happy and the fact that its not completely dark til almost 9 makes me more giddy than anything. its all about the weather mann. wow i have my radio and tv on but the tv is on mute and i looked up at the tv for a minute and it really looked like the cartoon on the tv was saying what was being said on the radio and it confused me greatly cuz i was like wait! the tv isnt even onnn!

anyway this past weekend was pretty fun. well friday night i did nothing at all, smoked a blunt and like fucking passed out i couldnt keep my eyes open. saturday i hung out with nikki for like an hour then chilled with myk for a while (beach and subway lol) and then after that i chilled with tatum and meghan. drank a little bit at tatums then headed over to the bar i had a lot of fun, i love goin out too bad i never have the money to damn do it. but yeah by the time we got out of the bar i had about 6 or 7 beers in me so needless to say i was pretty wasted lol. went back to tatums had some more beer smoked a little bit and then i was really fucked. good night though, and as long as i stay up through my fucked up ness i am fine in the morning. i felt a little ehh the next day but for how drunk i was the night before it was good. came home at like 930 sunday morning and slept for a couple of hours. woke up cuz i heard ppl comin over so i went upstairs n my grandma, grandpa, step grandparents and great grandma and aunt uncle adn cousins where here. the umbrella the we have in our table outside on the backporch got like lifted out of the table by the wind, landed on the roof, and fell back down onto the porch. kinda scary since if anyone got hit that prob would caused some serious damage, esp. if it had hit my grandfather in his wheel chair. after that grandma walked into the screen door and knocked it out completely and broke it for good haha. 

my other aunt and cousins came and my cousin patrick who is 5 was like following me around and talking to me NON STOP and then he found out i was a girl and wasnt my friend anymore ha! too freakin funny. and he said he thought i was a boy in front of the whole family it was just really funny. i confuse little children a lot. even mckenzie calls me a boy all of the time now and she KNOWS im not. i mean its really okay, if anything i like when ppl think im a guy so whateva.

so then i had to go see my mom and i ended up hanging out with her, her boyfriends ex wife, and his son and wife. ugh. terrible experience, i dislike my mothers boyfriend very much and his son is his fucking CLONE. and i mean that in personality way too and its just ugh. gross. after that i chilled w/ myk for a bit, and we went to my house and ant joined us, and kayla too, then myk left and kayla ant and i went out to the car. me n kayla smoked some whacky stuff and ant smoked a cig. he told us some fucking crazy ass hilarious dream he had about american idol omg too funny. thats pretty much the last thing i remember til waking up this morning for work haha.

work was good... spent the last 2 period outside on the playground. chris kept hugging me again that kid is too cute. i chilled w/ kayla for a bit after work we went to target so she could return some stuff and then to best buy so she could buy some shit and then we got subway and went to the beach haha. stayed there for a bit, watched ppl and birds and kinda the sunset through the mirrors lol. just got home a little while ago. im gonna go tho its time for the last blunt of the day.

"event","Hey hey!!! It's Saturday :).
Yesterday was a good day. It was yucky outside all day yesterday though. Work was fine, went by fast, Chris was in a floppy mcflop flop mood though. Thats okay cuz he's so cute. After work I went home and me and Kayla planned on getting a hotel room again this weekend cuz well its really the only place we can do anything at . So I packed up took my liquor and went to get Kayla and we came and got the room... Then we were both fucking STARVING so we went to eat at Uno's which was really really good. I haven't eaten there since I was like a lot younger. I enjoyed it. After that we went to VIP to look at drinking games but they had pretty much nothing so we looked at my favorite part of VIP... the boobies! No I'm just kidding we looked at the bongs and bowls and all that shit. Nothing we wanted so we bounced and went to Stop & Shop to get some food and stuff for the room for the weekend since we'll be here til Monday morning! Stopped to visit Nikki at work for a couple of minutes and then came back to the room. Kayla bought this thing to make balloon animals at S&S and was doing that for a bit (NOT intoxicated in any way mind you) lol and I just started drinkin. Found a lady bug on the ceiling and we both really liked her, I kept saving her from flying into the light and frying away so we named her Gabby Smalls, I actually got a picture of her lol and yes at this point we still weren't intoxicated lol. Well maybe I was on my way. Smoked a blunt, then got reallllly attached to Gabby lol and then Alisha and Nikki were here all of the sudden. I really don't remember much of the night because I dunno out of nowhere I was effed up. Next thing I know I'm waking up at like 6:30 this morning I don't remember anyone leaving, I didn't remember the lights being turned off I just really don't remember much. I had a wicked bad headache when I woke up so I took some aspirin then went back to sleep. Woke up at 1:11 which I was thought was kinda exciting. Showered and now here we are... I'm about to bring Kayla to her house so she can go shopping with her mom then I think I'm gonna go visit Auntie Rhena cuz they moved today and I said I'd take McKenzie out for a bit so we'l see. I'm glad its nice out I heard it was supposed to be crappy again today. Anyway I'm gonna go now cuz Kayla is ready, have a good day!!!

"event","Hey. Well I'm glad to say that my mood today is just so much better than yesterdays. I do not know what was wrong with me last night but i was so depressed! And that mood lasted all night fucking long until I smoked. Yeah, I got to smoke last night, it was excellent lol. But that wasn't til 10 pm. Before that I ended up taking a short nap and when I woke up I was still miserable bored and lonely. No one wanted to hang out so I was really sad and I just kept fucking crying for some reason. It was so annoying. I'm glad that today I'm feelin better. But now I'm like ugh I'm bored I wanna do something and there's nothing to do! My car is back! :) It's all better with a new tire n hubcap and rim and all. It only came out to be 188 bucks so thats not too bad I'll be able to pay that back quickly I hope. I had to borrow money from my Grandma again, I already owe her 400... well technically I think I owe her like 2,400 or something because she paid for Spindle and my first 6 months of insurance on Spindle, and helped fix him a couple of times. And now she helped me fix my new car... which still doesn't have a name btw. I don't know her name... I know she's definitely a girl and definitely a lesbian lol but as far as her name goes I don't know it yet.
Anyway today on the way home from work I was ROCKING out. OMG I FUCKING love ""Beast of Burden"" SO much mmph and then I was listening to ""Blinded By The Light"", ""Why Can't This Be Love"" and ""D'yer Ma'ker"" oh and ""I Want You To Want Me"" lol all those songs I rocked the hell out to. LOVE IT! I love the nice weather. I wanna just drive fast forever with the windows down and my favorite songs blasting and I just wanna be singing along at the top of my lungs. It makes me happy :) So now here I am down in my stupid room... okay my room isn't stupid its awesome and full of nekkid ladies ;) but I wanna go out into the world and do something but ... the money thing kinda stops that lol but even so, there's still nothing to do. I wanna go to a field thats completely empty and like sit in my car with all the doors open and blast music and smoke a blunt. That would be sweet. Don't know any fields I can just park my car in though hah. I gotta figure out something to dooooo. I definitely am gonna go out now that I have my car :). Hm hm hm.
Work was good today, I really really really LOVE my damn job. I love Chris I love him so much he is so freaking cute and ahhh. I just love everything lol. I love that its nice out and I get to be outside a lot it makes me happy. Haha this entry is just like wow everything makes me happy and yesterday I wanted to just fall off of the earth.
Tomorrow is Friday and I'm glad for that one because I can't wait to get drunk. That sounds good lmao. Oh well I love being drunk what can I say haha. OH MAN am I in a wonderful mood. Well that's about it I guess I'll be peacin out for now. LATA!

"event","so.
im in like, a really bad mood. not bad like the kind where im bitching at everyone and everything around me and i feel like angry. like... sad i guess. i do not know why.
all day at work i was fine, when i was driving home from work i just felt like crying all of the sudden and it hasn't gone away.
i started thinking about how bad i want my own fucking place... thats what got me sad actually i think. i want my own place SO bad. i wish i could afford it but it just doesnt seem like it'll ever be possible. i do not make enough money. it just seems so far away and its just like i wanna get out NOW. i wanna go home from work and smoke a blunt in my fucking living room if i feel like it. i wanna be alone and not have to deal with anyone. i want to just get out so bad and i just dont know its just driving me insane. my money issues just suck. i got all those random bills outof nowhere. luckily i ended up getting rid of that dentist one though because i called and she said since my insurance is in there now i prob wont have to pay anything.
anyway then i get home from work all depressed and mopey feeling but im kinda happy because i thought i was getting my car today. nope. i went inside and asked dad when we were getting my car and he told me we could cuz they close at 5 and i got home at 5. so that really sucked too and i felt like crying even more. i just want my damn car.
so now im like... just very very very blah feeling. i just cried for a minute because i dunno. i do not even know why i feel this sad. im probably just really really tired because last night i went to bed wayyyyy too late again for my own good. im also sad because i have no weed. i know that might sound ridiculous but honestly im just in a bad mood i wish i could smoke right now it would make me feel so much better. ugh i dunno im just being ridiculous. i dont even feel like using my voice. i just wanna sit here and pout basically. i hate moods like this. esp. when u dont know why its happening.
at least its almost the weekend already, not that that matters i actually think i have more fun during the week because work gives me something to do... something that i like to do. im usually bored during the days on the weekend, or sleeping them away.
also my stomach keeps fucking making all these noises and its annoying me because i just fuckin ate i know im not hungry and i just want it to stop. im just gonna go all im doing is complaining."

"event","Hola. So it's back to work, my vacation ended on a more pleasant note than it began. And being at work really isn't bad. I noticed today about 5 times I went ... wait, I'm at WORK right now. It's just, I really fucking love my job! Honestly the only thing I really don't like is waking up in the morning. That's it. Once I'm up and on my way there its just awesome. I love it. Like today for instance, I was outside for at least 2 hours playing on a playground. Just awesome so yay for me. The only other thing is that I wish I made more money lol but oh well. For some reason I am just very very poor right now. I have to pay 87 dollars to Uconn within 30 days or else its going on my credit report, I have to pay like 80 bucks to renew my registration by May 10th, I have to pay my phone bill which is 150 bucks this month, I have to pay my insurance which is 170 something all with one check. OH yeah and that little matter of my tire and rim. UGH. I really don't even see how its possible. Plus I owe Kayla mad money because we switched to Verizon from T-Mobile and had to cancel our plans which is like a lot of money. Oh well it'll work out somehow. As long as everything is paid off I'll catch up. What really screwed me over is my tire and the random Uconn bill. It's cuz I never returned my key to them last year so they had to change the lock. AHHH. 
Wow okay anyway I got really side tracked. I have so much to do. Oh crap I just realized I owe 100 dollars to pphood and 130 to my dentist which I have to call because it shouldn't be that much since I have my insurance. Crap. FUcking money man. Oh well. Anyway I'm really really tired. I am gonna lay down. Peace.

You're a falling star, You're the get away car.
You're the line in the sand when I go too far.
You're the swimming pool, on an August day.
And You're the perfect thing to see.

And you play your card, but it's kinda cute.
Ah, When you smile at me you know exactly what you do.
Baby don't pretend, that you don't know it's true.
Cause you can see it when I look at you.

[Chorus:]
And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, You make me sing.
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.

You're a carousel, you're a wishing well,
And you light me up, when you ring my bell.
You're a mystery, you're from outer space,
You're every minute of my everyday.






100 percent completely in love with this song

And I can't believe, uh that I'm your man,
And I get to kiss you baby just because I can.
Whatever comes our way, ah we'll see it through,
And you know that's what our love can do.

[Chorus:]
And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, You make me sing
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.

So, La, La, La, La, La, La, La
So, La, La, La, La, La, La, La

And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, You make me sing.
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.
You're every song, and I sing along.
Cause you're my everything.
yeah, yeah

"event","I hope it doesn't continue into the week. There's a lot of shit goin' on with people I know and a lot of it is scary but hopefully everyone will pull through. Saturday Nikki was supposed to leave for Italy and on the bus to the airport (she was on a bus because she was going with her class) she had a seizure, so that was pretty scary. And esp. since Friday night I didn't sleep at all and then Saturday was just a really stressful day but Nikki is good now we think. It was probably just a one time random thing but still scary, and now she doesn't get to be in Italy. I hit a fuckin' pot hole on Saturday night driving to Kayla's house and then found out Sunday morning that I got a flat tire and bent my rim so it's gonna be like 300 bucks to fucking fix because I have to pay for the rim, the tire, and the labor. Fucking blows. I really don't have the money for that, but I'll figure it out somehow. Kayla's car died today too while she was at work which really fucking sucks too. But anyway I am in a happy mood because I'm on vacation and that's always a plus. An easy way to get paid for a full week too. And I'm proud of myself because I haven't called out in a month from work which is always a plus. On the down side I was supposed to go visit Dani on Wednesday but I probably won't be able to now because of my car being broken (kinda funny/ironic though because I was on the phone with her when I hit the pot hole) and it won't be fixed til after Wednesday most likely. I could probably take Dad's truck or something but if I'm not gonna have enough money to fix my car I probably shouldn't go somewhere but the thing is its not like I'm gonna spend a lot of money there or something. I dunno I'll figure it out because I really want to go it was like the one thing I was actually doing this week. We'll see. I'm so mad I fucking had to do that to my new car though but ... oh well what are ya gonna do I'm thankful it wasn't something more serious, and with the way things have been going I wouldn't have been surprised is if it was. Anyway I'm gonna go eat or something but to everyone that this terrible month of April is affecting you are all in my thoughts and I hope everything works out. Peace.

I'm about to head up to Uncle Duke's in a little bit, it should be fun. I love seeing my whole entire family. It's always an entertaining time. Just watching them interact with eachother haha. And I love all of my cousins being there and playing together and its just fun. I love family stuff. Lately I've been thinking I don't want kids because that's a lot of money and 18+ years of your life dedicated to raising other human beings and I dunno. But obviously at this point in my life I shouldn't be wanting kids because I don't even want a relationship because I'm feeling rather selfish. I always take care of people hell its my job to take care of people and I've always been in a relationship and done this for this person and that for that person I just wanna live for me and do what I wanna do w/out feeling bad or anything like that. Okay wow random rant haha I was writing about Easter. So yeah it should be fun.
Lately all I keep thinking about is how fucking bad I want my own apartment and how I just don't see it happening any time soon and it's really killing me because its pretty much the main thing that consumes my mind. It would be so fucking great to have my own place. I have to figure something out so I can get one because I'm gonna go crazy. I really wish I could have my OWWWN place like no roommate because I want to be in charge. I want to be the one in charge of the rules what I say goes no compromising with a roommate. Although lets face it in the end I'm better off having someone because I don't like being alone most of the time. Although lately I've gotten better about that and kinda crave my alone time. Either way its just frustrating because it won't be happening for a long time. Unless I get like 2 more jobs and just work all the fucking time. I need a job as a waitress or bartender or something that gets tips, thats what I need. But UGH I hate working in restaurants. I really need to win a scratch off or something but that'll never happen either so I just don't know what to do, I'm kinda stuck. Just deal with it I guess. One day it'll happen. According to the psychic I will have my own home when I'm 24, but I don't wanna wait that long to move out!!! That's okay because at least I'm being kinda smart about it and not moving out until I know I have enough money saved up n all that shit. Once I move out I plan on staying out. I don't wanna move out then have to move back home in a year. There's nothing wrong with it its just not something I ever want to do. Once I have a taste of it I dunno if I can even handle being home again.
I guess my mind is just not on Easter lol. So yeah today should be fun, then I gotta work all week and then I have next week off which is soooo awesome. It came so fast. I'm tellin ya time is just flyyyyyyyying lately I really don't understand. I've been realizing it and trying to appreciate each day more because its just gone so quick, and certain days just get lost in time and I wanna be able to remember more of my days.
Anyway... 
Last night was fun, I babysat (easiest thing everrr) and then me n Kayla went to Moms and hung out with Nik, Colin, Myk, and Alisha. We played that game where everyone writes down a celebrity and then sticks it on someone else's head and that person has to figure out who they are. But we played the drinking version of it. That gets soooo hard when you are intoxicated let me tell you! Haha you forget the questions you asked and stuff. It was so fun and addicting. So I definitely had a good night. Hmm... I guess I'm all drained of stuff to write about for the moment. I was tryin to kill a lot of time before I had to leave but I still have like a half hour. I'll go drink some water cuz I'm thirsty... that'll take up all of 30 seconds haha. Well happy easter to those of you who celebrate it and for those of you who don't... well sorry then its just a Sunday and Sundays suck unless football is on haha. Peace.

"event","Heyy.
So last night me and Myk didn't go to the club I ended up goin' to chill w/ Dani. It was good times. She made brownies and they were delicious. Then we went in the hot tub and hung out in there for a while with her brother and her brothers friend. I want a hot tub really badly now. I just wanna smoke a blunt and chill in there. That would be sweet. Anyway after that we came in and talked a little then I came home and hung out with Kayla. We were gonna go to mom's but by the time I got home it was kind of late and I felt really sick for some reason so we just smoked at her house then went inside and went to bed. 
Today was kind of pointless, woke up at like 12:30 and then went for a ride with Kayla and her brother's dog Hazel (SO CUTE!) to get food and then we went back to her house and smoked and just watched tv. I'm home now and I have to babysit in a little while. Like from 8-11 or something not a long time at all and I think the kids will be in bed anyway.So that's exciting. I wanna like go out or do something fun tonight. We'll see I suppose. Anyway thats my update for now, kinda stupid but its all I can do for now. Peace.

INSANE. i cant believe how fast the past couple of years have gone by. well im gonna go so i can start heading up to wethersfield but ill do another update maybe later tonight or tomorrow. i suppose that be it. peace.

"event","So today today... 
I gave myself a personal day because honestly I dunno why I just needed one haha. Yesterday I got pinched and bruised and it was just too much. I cannot wait until Thursday because my Christopher will be back in school. THANK GOD I MISS HIM SO MUCH! I've been all around the school for the past week and a half I feel like a sub. I have had a lot of period off though so I can't complain, I just really miss Chris so much.
Anyway so today I had a crazy cleaning spree. I cleaned my bathroom completely and then cleaned my room and vacuumed got rid of all the clutter and garbage and finished up all of my laundry folded it and put it away. Then I downloaded some music put some pics up on facebook and showered. Went and had lunch w/ my baby I made sandwiches and it was cute ya know lol. Came home smoked a little and jus dicked around online for a bit. Now my camera just broke and I'm sad. I gotta find my warranty thinger and bring it to get fixed, I can't even explain what happened. I was taking pics, put it down, picked it back up and that was it. I turned it off and turned it back on and the lens is like struggling to come out and its stuck and it just keeps telling me to turn it off and back on. So annoying and depressing. At least its free to fix. Good thing for warranties. Anyway thats pretty much it. Myk is comin over and Kayla is too so soon I won't be alone anymore and I can be in the company of 2 of my favorite people. Dunno what we'll do but we'll figure it out. I know at least one thing we're gonna do. Okay anyway I better go LATA!"

"event","Heyyyyyyyy. I had a really good day today so I felt like updating. I dunno why but on the way to work today I was just in the best mood ever, actually like, all day long I was. It was so sunny and warmer then it has been. I cannot wait for spring and for it to start warming up and being able to drive w/ my windows down and all that fun stuff!! CAN'T WAIT! It'll be amazing. Yeah.

Work today was... well ya know work. It was good, Chris has his moments, and he really didn't want to do any work at all so that was a lil frustrating but oh well. Had a meeting after work which was pretty interesting we watched this video about this woman with autism which she actually made and edited herself and I dunno its hard to explain but it was just amazing. She is sooooo incredibly smart. Finally ppl were saying what I always think, like if the kids are rocking or just doing something that we deem inappropriate just let them do it for a minute or w/e maybe they NEED it to focus or w/e. Like with Chris if he flops to the ground everyone gets on him like GET UP CHRISTOPHER GET UP!! GET HIM UP! And we do lifts and shit to get him up but sometimes I just look him right in the eyes and I'm like okay if you need a minute you can have it, I'll walk away n come back and he gets right up. It's like he just needs one minute to himself without ppl yelling at him or w/e. Yeah. Anyways...

After work we went to Auntie Rhena's and ate a yummy dinner and she went to McKenzie's parent/teacher conference thinger at 6:30 we had to babysit for an hour. It was Alyssa, Lauren, and McKenzie so I didn't really have to do much Lauren and McKenzie entertain eachother until they start fighting lol and Alyssa is 11 so she's cool. I got a bad headache though for some reason, I think cuz I'm really really tired for some reason. Well I guess probably cuz I'm not used to waking up so early. 

Now I'm just chillin. I cleaned my room n folded/put away all of my laundry and just got rid of all the junk. I hate when my room is messy. Tomorrow is Thursday which kinda sucks cuz I really hate inclusion. I can't wait cuz I think next year Chris doesn't have it. I don't know why I don't like it, I mean its easy and he just plays games the whole time its just he really doesn't like it he isn't really ever into the games. Oh well. It's also just awkward with the kids and its like the same 4 games so they get bored. Oh well. I don't think they care too much cuz it gets them out of class. I'm so excited for Friday cuz me n Myk are goin to Triangles again and this time we know how to get there lol and its girls night whoo hoo haha. Not that I'm lookin' but I like meeting lesbians. I hope there are more ppl there than last time we went cuz seriously it was so empty. Yeahh so I guess thats it for now. Lata...

Anyway thought I had stuff to write about but apparently not lol. I was getting stressed about money but yesterday I sat down and wrote down all the dates of my checks I'm getting and what I'm going to do and I figured out I can have my best buy credit card paid off by mid April and my other credit card paid off by May. I know its far away but I feel good about it. I still owe my Grandma 400 but I dunno what to do about that really. That'll have to wait I guess...
Ugh I'm watching ""The Hills"" and I'm getting so angry I hate Spencer lol. I can't even believe I like this show but I do. It's addicting. I missed the last 2 episodes but I'm excited cuz I think they're gonna play them right now.
Yay they are. Okay I really have nothing to say I guess.
Vacation was fun, I went to Rhode Island on Thursday to visit Dani and it was really fun. Ended up staying there 2 nights even though I only planned on staying Thursday but I had to see Danielle!!
Saturday night we had a party at Moms again.. I got ridiculously drunk but I had a lot of fun. I had to babysit Sunday morning at 11:00 which sucked but I couldn't really sleep anyway so whatever. We had fun we took McKenzie to Smiles which btw that place is ridiculous every fucking thing in the kiddie section is broken, but anyway took her there, she got a ""prize"" lol a red puppy stuffed animal she loooooved it. And then we took her to Friendly's which the waitress there was in love with me too lol. After that we took her home and stay for a little bit then left cuz we were beat since we had like no sleep the night before. Anyway thats about it. Went to bed hoping for a snow day and got it. Yeah. All right peace out.

I gotta shower and hang up a lot of my clothes and all that. Ugh I really wish we could just get an apartment together already ughhh. Her having no job doesn't really help that though, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed I know she'll get a job soon and I know that eventually we will get our own place n it'll be awesome. I just wanna be out of the house already. First I need a new car though. UGh stupid life. On the other hand... I didn't go to work today, I might as well have though. Last night I could NOT fall asleep for the life of me because its so fucking cold in my room, and it sucks sleeping alone when you are not used to it. I didn't even know how much just having Kayla next to me helped me sleep. Also something is wrong with my neck/shoulder(s) so its like no matter how I lay I'm in pain. When I did sleep it was like for a half hour, then I'd wake up and roll over, then sleep for 5 seconds then wake up and roll over and so on. Also my throat was basically on FIRE and swollen and omg it fucking hurt. So I called out... I hate calling out when I just started somewhere but honestly I could not go in today. So I went to Mom's because I didn't want Dad to know that I called out for some reason... and I had to move my car anyway, so I figured I'd just leave. I left at normal time and I went to BK to get breakfast cuz I love me some BK breakfast and then went to Mom's, ate it, and then went upstairs to sleep. Well let me tell you... sleeping in that fucking house is IMPOSSIBLE. OMG The fuuuuuuuuuuucking phone rang SOOOOO many times its like non-stop people calling, and it's all fucking telemarketers usually not even for the right person. So that failed. So I'm really damn tired right now. I can't wait to get paid on Wednesday because I'm gonna go get a doorknob w/ a lock and key for my bedroom cuz I feel like Lois comes in here when I'm not here and it really pisses me off there's no need for her to be in my room. I'll probably get in a lot of trouble but I don't even fucking care. After she yelled at me the other day for no reason eff her. So w/e. Anyway I need to stop cracking my knuckles because I honestly think I'm getting arthritis already. Like using anything where I have to have my fingers bent for a long time they get like stuck and its really painful. So annoying. Of course as I'm writing about cracking my knuckles I start cracking them ha. Oh well. Ugh I'm so thirsty or like, my throat is so bleh feeling. I do not wanna get sick. Not yet! I don't have insurance yet. Soon though... Kinda. Okay well thats it for now I guess. I don't wanna go back to work now that I've had 5 days off haha but I do miss Chris all I dreamt about when I DID sleep at Mom's was being at work and Chris and yeah lol. So w/e. And I get done at like 2:45 tomorrow because he has inclusion. Okie dokie thats all.

"event","Don't know the last time I updated really. Figured I would cuz I have time to kill... So last night effin sucked. Lois pretty much kicked Kayla out. Okay saying it that way makes it sound really like, mean. She wasn't angry she just told her she had to move out because she was ""uncomfortable"" with her living here. ??? Yeah I don't fuckin get it but oh well. It's like suddenly after 3 months you are uncomfortable?? Ugh it makes me so mad. I'm so sad :( Sleeping alone last night sucked a lot because I am just so not used to it. Like being alone for such a long amount of time is just not normal for me. Maybe it'll be good for me?? I don't see how really though because obviously I was perfectly content. Now my room is sad and empty and I'm lonely. I mean obviously we still go out lol but I dunno I just hate that we can't sleep together every night and I have no one to say goodbye to in the morning before I go to work. No one to tell me be safe and have fun haha. She says it to me everyday when I leave.... it goes ""I love you, be careful, have fun, I love you, I love you, I love you"" lol its really cute. So anyway... sucks bein all alone at night but I suppose I'll get used to it.
Other than that work is going well, I really like it a lot. Like in the morning when I first wake up I'm like ugggg I wanna call out and just sleep longer. But once I'm there time just flies by and I honestly just love it. I'll be like sitting there with Chris thinking wow this job is just awesome. I'm helping a kid out who has some disabilities and I'm getting paid for it and its just really a great feeling. I love helping people and I dunno but this is just like the best job for me ever. It's definitely great.
Tomorrow is a half day then no more work for the rest of the week which is awesome, haha even though I just went on about how I love it, I still enjoy my days off! Thats the other great thing, working at a school you get all the vacations and holidays that the kids get off!!! So nice. Cuz like working at Subway or places like that you have to worry about taking the days off for the holidays or worry about if you are gonna be scheduled n all that crap. This is just like nope no holidays. AWESOME!
Ugh last night I burned the roof of my mouth like right behind my teeth but I guess I got it really good because now its all cut up and in pain and anything I eat hurts so bad. It reminds me of when I had the surgery on my gums. Ugh. Never again definitely not. Lets see what else... nothing much. Sleepin at Auntie Rhena's tonight cuz she and Frank are gone for the night and McKenzie is sleeping at Mimi's. Should be fun. I actually get to sleep with my girlfriend tonight. Well I guess that's really it. Life is definitely good.

Hopefully it goes well and I love it, but I have a feeling I will. This past week was a lot of fun and full of a lot of stuff for us cuz most of the time me and Kayla don't do anything lol. We hung out with Jowan and Kaitlyn and carved pumpkins. It was a very tedious task. But afterwards it was worth it. My pumpkin came out sweet. I carved a spider. There's pics on my page they're in a photoflick thinger. Definitely cool. Or something. Today me and Kayla rented like 4 movies... ""Thank You For Smoking"", ""Birth"", ""The River King"", and some stupid horror movie. We haven't watched anything yet but ""Thank You For Smoking"" which was pretty good. That kid that is in like every single movie was in it.. you know the kid from God Send, and um.. a bunch of other movies. It was kind of a boring day really. Just woke up and went to blockbuster, then to burger king, taco bell, and mcdonalds haha we're fat. No I just got BK but Kayla got taco bell and a salad from mcdonalds. Smoked on the way home, came in and watched our movie. Were gonna start another movie like 2 hours ago but we both went online. Except Kayla's computer keeps losing connection for some reason. I wanna watch another movie now cuz I'm getting bored and I feel tired. On Wednesday after work I'm gonna go clothes shopping cuz I need new shirts I'm so sick of all the ones I have. I feel like I only wear the same five. Nothing else really... peace out.

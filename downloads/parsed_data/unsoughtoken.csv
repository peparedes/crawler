"event","Sometimes, it is best, to let go of what is left, and let it lie where it may lay and leave it (let it rest). Best to gently slip away (as gently as possible, remove the blade), and wait until the day comes when the bitterness is only a slightly lingering scent, the ocean licking at a bay. And maybe then, on a sunset striped road, two cars will pass. (and that will be that).

but, now i know, and in my own words. this is what you sought to teach me, but i cannot be taught without having lived enough first."

but i needed to write it, to think it out, and come to the realization, that i'm justifying how i feel, and trying to convince someone else that it's okay that i feel that way.

wha? duh, of course it's fine i feel that way. (what a fucking realization).

i always feel like i'm being accused or I have to defend how i feel or what i think to that particular person. and, i don't. i can feel however the fuck i want, even if it's the complete opposte of what i'm told i should, can, could, may, would, had, have, am now, -feel. 

seriously! it's ridiculous to feel the need to justify any feeling that springs from the depths of the heart or soul. and it's a terrible and confusing feeling to feel that it's necessary to justify what i'm feeling.

"event","Compassion is a trait i need to develop within myself. for if i see something that is totally ridiculous and insane and ignorant and blahblahblah. i just get angry. instead of being understanding, and wanting to say something constructive, i just want to laugh. 

somedays i feel like i have this secret, even with the drama over gregory, this gift to realize that what i have is so amazing. maybe it comes from being in Coda and everyone always (ALWAYS) saying: ""I'm grateful for this meeting, for being here today, for being alive.""

<lj-cut text=""attitude o gratitude"">

I used to just roll my eyes and be like 'yeah right.'

but i get it now. i really get it now. every morning i wake up grateful. it may not last, but my days are now smoother than most days, and when i go to sleep at night, as i lay in bed in the dark, i think in my head about things i am grateful for that happened during the day.

""The attitude of Gratitude.""

I realize, as I practice that, just how much I have. My sponsor is always reminding me: ""Attitude of Gratitude!!"" She also practices the idea of ""what you think of is what you get.""

it makes sense, most the time, and i enjoy it.

I'm grateful for being dry on this wet day, for being warm at night, for having a mattress to rest my head, to wake with a stove in the kitchen, and gas to cook my food on, frozen vegetables in the freezer, clothes in the closet, underwear waiting in the laundry machine to be dried, the neighbors next door, my coworkers, my ability to feel emotions.

gratitude makes me feel rich. it's like spreading a feast table before me, where there was once nothing but air. i'm grateful for food: BAM! roast chicken breast with vegetables, vegetable soup, apples, grapes, vegetables, bread pudding, fish, ice cream, fruits, juice, water, milk, cheeses...

when i realize how much i have, i begin to lose sight of what i <i>don't</i> have. I am content with what i have. Not lazy, not immoving, but content and grateful for what I've been provided with, and what my own hands have given me. 

I have dreams. I have dreams that I am working hard to make realities. I have goals, then, not dreams. I have tangible, real and workable goals. Would I rather be doing something else?

No. No I wouldn't. I am so damn happy to have what I have and to be going where I'm going that I can't begin to think of where I'd rather be.

Now, I don't fucking know how this turned to be about gratitude when i was originally aiming for compassion. Compassion for two people I know, perhaps three, who are so unhappy-discontented that i want to just forget about them. I don't want to speak to them, don't want to see them, don't want to be in their presence or think of them. Being with discontented people starts to wear out my content. They focus on what they don't have, and bring my attention to what i don't. ""I'm going home for Thanksgiving, but this year we're having ham instead of turkey. I hate ham. are you going home for thanksgiving? Oh...you're not? Doesn't that suck so much! How are you going to deal with being away from your family?!""

Yes, I'll be away from my family, but I've been invited to two thanksgiving happenings, will be making holiday pay, will have time off from school to go where I want to go, have three free days to myself, won't have to spend the money to fly, won't have to go for a forty-eight hour trip, won't have to deal with diet issues, meeting issues...etc. And, my family is my family whether or not i'm three thousand miles away. I will call them, and speak with everyone and be happy that, here, I will be surrounded by friends. who are just like family.

yeah, and at first, i really hated practicing the attitude of gratitude. how can i be grateful when my clothes don't fit, my shoes get wet every time i go outside, the house smells like shit, i can't sleep, i'm lonely, and i haven't seen my family in forever?

jesus christ. 

i'm grateful my shoes dry, that the house doesn't smell most the time, that i <i>have</i> a family, i can stay up late and write or read, that i'm not always lonely, and that some of my clothes do fit, they're clean and they're warm.

booya. now, negative thoughts, shush up. i've got a load of gratitude with your name on it, buster. One negative mood and I'm going to blast ya."

And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.'

I

There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight,
      To me did seem       
     Apparelled in celestial light, 
The glory and the freshness of a dream. 
It is not now as it hath been of yore; -       
     Turn wheresoe'er I may,         
      By night or day, 
The things which I have seen I now can see no more. 


II 
    
     The Rainbow comes and goes,     
     And lovely is the Rose,     
     The Moon doth with delight   
 Look round her when the heavens are bare;     
     Waters on a starry night     
     Are beautiful and fair;   
   The sunshine is a glorious birth;   
   But yet I know, where'er I go, 
That there hath past away a glory from the earth.


III
  
Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,   
  And while the young lambs bound     
    As to the tabor's sound, 
To me alone there came a thought of grief: 
A timely utterance gave that thought relief,     
    And I again am strong: 
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep; 
No more shall grief of mine the season wrong; 
I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng, 
The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep,     
    And all the earth is gay;         
     Land and sea   
   Give themselves up to jollity,     
    And with the heart of May   
   Doth every Beast keep holiday; -     
    Thou Child of Joy, 
Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy 
     Shepherd-boy!


IV
   
Ye blessed Creatures, I have heard the call   
  Ye to each other make; I see 
The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;   
  My heart is at your festival,     
   My head hath its coronal, 
The fulness of your bliss, I feel - I feel it all.     
   Oh evil day! if I were sullen     
   While the Earth herself is adorning,       
     This sweet May-morning,     
   And the Children are culling       
     On every side,     
   In a thousand valleys far and wide,     
   Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm, 
And the Babe leaps up on his Mother's arm: -     
   I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!     
   - But there's a Tree, of many, one, 
A single Field which I have looked upon, 
Both of them speak of something that is gone:       
   The Pansy at my feet       
   Doth the same tale repeat: 
Whither is fled the visionary gleam? 
Where is it now, the glory and the dream?


V

Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: 
The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,     
   Hath had elsewhere its setting,       
     And cometh from afar:     
   Not in entire forgetfulness,     
   And not in utter nakedness, 
But trailing clouds of glory do we come     
   From God, who is our home: 
Heaven lies about us in our infancy! 
Shades of the prison-house begin to close     
   Upon the growing Boy, 
But He beholds the light, and whence it flows,     
   He sees it in his joy; 
The Youth, who daily farther from the east     
   Must travel, still is Nature's Priest,     
   And by the vision splendid     
   Is on his way attended; 
At length the Man perceives it die away, 
And fade into the light of common day.


VI

Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own; 
Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind, 
And, even with something of a Mother's mind,     
   And no unworthy aim,     
   The homely Nurse doth all she can 
To make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man,     
   Forget the glories he hath known, 
And that imperial palace whence he came.


VII   

Behold the Child among his new-born blisses, 
A six years' Darling of a pigmy size! 
See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies, 
Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses, 
With light upon him from his father's eyes! 
See, at his feet, some little plan or chart, 
Some fragment from his dream of human life, 
Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;   
   A wedding or a festival,   
   A mourning or a funeral;     
     And this hath now his heart,
   And unto this he frames his song:     
     Then will he fit his tongue 
To dialogues of business, love, or strife;     
   But it will not be long     
   Ere this be thrown aside,   
   And with new joy and pride 
The little Actor cons another part; 
Filling from time to time his ""humorous stage"" 
With all the Persons, down to palsied Age, 
That Life brings with her in her equipage;     
   As if his whole vocation     
   Were endless imitation.


VIII   

Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie     
   Thy Soul's immensity; 
Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep 
Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind, 
That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep, 
Haunted for ever by the eternal mind, -     
   Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!     
   On whom those truths do rest, 
Which we are toiling all our lives to find, 
In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave; 
Thou, over whom thy Immortality 
Broods like the Day, a Master o'er a Slave, 
A Presence which is not to be put by;       
   To whom the grave 
Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight     
   Of day or the warm light, 
A place of thought where we in waiting lie; 
Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might 
Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height, 
Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke 
The years to bring the inevitable yoke, 
Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife? 
Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight, 
And custom lie upon thee with a weight, 
Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!


IX
      
    O joy! that in our embers     
    Is something that doth live,     
    That nature yet remembers     
    What was so fugitive! 
The thought of our past years in me doth breed 
Perpetual benediction: not indeed 
For that which is most worthy to be blest; 
Delight and liberty, the simple creed 
Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest, 
With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast: - 
    Not for these I raise     
    The song of thanks and praise;   
  But for those obstinate questionings   
  Of sense and outward things,   
  Fallings from us, vanishings;   
  Blank misgivings of a Creature 
Moving about in worlds not realised, 
High instincts before which our mortal Nature 
Did tremble like a guilty Thing surprised:     
    But for those first affections,     
    Those shadowy recollections,   
  Which, be they what they may, 
Are yet the fountain-light of all our day, 
Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;   
  Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make 
Our noisy years seem moments in the being 
Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,       
    To perish never; 
Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavor,       
    Nor Man nor Boy, 
Nor all that is at enmity with joy, 
Can utterly abolish or destroy!   
  Hence in a season of calm weather     
    Though inland far we be, 
Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea     
    Which brought us hither,   
  Can in a moment travel thither, 
And see the Children sport upon the shore, 
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.


X
 
Then sing, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous song!     
    And let the young Lambs bound     
    As to the tabor's sound! 
We in thought will join your throng,     
    Ye that pipe and ye that play,     
    Ye that through your hearts today     
    Feel the gladness of the May! 
What though the radiance which was once so bright 
Be now for ever taken from my sight,   
  Though nothing can bring back the hour 
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;     
    We will grieve not, rather find     
    Strength in what remains behind;     
    In the primal sympathy     
    Which having been must ever be;     
    In the soothing thoughts that spring     
    Out of human suffering;     
    In the faith that looks through death, 
In years that bring the philosophic mind.


XI
   
And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves, 
Forebode not any severing of our loves! 
Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might; 
I only have relinquished one delight 
To live beneath your more habitual sway. 
I love the Brooks which down their channels fret, 
Even more than when I tripped lightly as they; 
The innocent brightness of a new-born Day       
      Is lovely yet; 
The Clouds that gather round the setting sun 
Do take a sober colouring from an eye 
That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality; 
Another race hath been, and other palms are won. 
Thanks to the human heart by which we live, 
Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears, 
To me the meanest flower that blows can give 
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears."

"event","to end the day i am going to call my daddy.

on a listserv i mentioned what he'd said to me about pain and strength, courage and fear. and today (days after having posted it), a lady e-mailed me back and said: ""Your Dad was very wise, JR. Isn't it wonderful that we carry the wisdom of our parents with us all of our lives? We just need to be silent and calm and listen for it.""

It is wonderful, and I need to be silent and calm and listen more often. To both my parents.

I don't like the use of ""was,"" but that makes me want to speak with him more, we've been playing phonetag for a week. And makes me want to cry. One day, my daddy's gonna die. 

And, jr, for some reason, has become my name. I sort of like it. whole va class calls me jr because i -once- signed an e-mail to the prof. ""jrsmith"" because i was in a hurry. i don't think i mind it. a new moniker.

it's going to be freezing on the porch, so i'm going to take with me a blanket. i wish i would hurry up and finish my scarf. therapist saw it and said the first personal thing to me about her tastes: ""that's a really pretty scarf."" i like it too. :D"

"event","i am so very sad. there is a list of things i <i>must</i> do this weekend, and with the day half gone, i've done none of them. i'd rather sit and be sad than complete assignments i'd rather not be doing, pointlesses, i don't understand the need to copy what others have said and put it off as my own and original thoughts. can't i be original? can't i say what i would?

this new craft of having to cite; prove where i've got my thoughts from handicaps my creativity, my thoughts. it makes it so i have to search for someone else's thoughts on a topic, instead of utilizing my own brain. it makes me incredibly sick and sad, and i've always (always) resisted it. and here i am, again, being asked to use adorno  and benjamin to write an essay about television and whether or not it can be used as a tool for social change.

yes it can. but not positive. and neither adorno nor benjamin address that. and it makes me want to puke that i am limited by the teacher's thoughts on what i ought to think.

i'm reading a new book. a new author. it's called <i>lust</i> by elfriede jelinek. i received a fifty dollar gift certificate to the school's bookstore for signing up early for my meal plan. received it last week. and i bought jelinek, emerson and derrida. why use a giftcertificate, free to me, to buy philosophy? my times are changing, aren't they?

that familiar feeling about my wrists has begun again. the intent of a thought meant to slice and draw blood. i hate the feeling of ropes enclosing, of struggling against self-bonds, against society, against inbreeding. i'm so tired of constantly fighting myself for the right to be myself. i know why so many ""thinkers"" end up crazy or drunk or dead from some wasting disease. self-searching constantly makes the body, the soul, the mind very tired. especially when being bled dry by the bite of insanity from within, from wanting to control, and not taking those steps to unsheathe my claws. from being forced into tiny boxes because This Is How It Is, and This Is How It Has Been. 

Systems systematically destroy thought. Try and break free, and you're charged with plagarism (even if you are unique)."

<lj-cut text="""">

Intimations of Immortality From Recollections of Early Childhood 

Wordsworth


The Child is father of the Man; 
And I could wish my days to be 
Bound each to each by natural piety. - 

I. 

THERE was a time when meadow, grove, and stream, 
The earth, and every common sight, 
To me did seem 
Apparelled in celestial light, 
The glory and the freshness of a dream. 
It is not now as it hath been of yore;- 
Turn wheresoe'er I may, 
By night or day, 
The things which I have seen I now can see no more. - 

II. 

The Rainbow come and goes, 
And lovely is the Rose, 
The Moon doth with delight 
Look round her when the heavens are bare, 
Waters on a starry night 
Are beautiful and fair; 
The sunshine is a glorious birth; 
But yet I know, where'er I go. 
That there hath past away a glory from the earth. - 

III. 

Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song, 
And while the young lambs bound 
As to the tabor's sound, 
To me alone there came a thought of grief: 
A timely utterance gave that thought relief, 
And I again am strong: 
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep; 
No more shall grief of mine the season wrong; 
I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng, 
The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep, 
And all the earth is gay; 
Land and sea 
Give themselves up to jollity, 
And with the heart of May 
Doth every Beast keep holiday;- 
Thou Child of Joy, 
Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-Boy! - 

IV. 

Ye blessed Creatures, I have heard the call 
Ye to each other make; I see 
The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee; 
My heart is at your festival, 
My head hath its coronal, 
The fulness of your bliss, I feel- I feel it all. 
Oh evil day! if I were sullen 
While Earth herself is adorning, 
This sweet May-morning, 
And the Children are culling 
On every side, 
In a thousand valleys far and wide, 
Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm, 
And the Babe leaps up on his Mother's arm:- 
I hear, I hear, with joy I hear! 
-But there's a Tree, of many, one, 
A single Field which I have looked upon, 
Both of them speak of something that is gone: 
The Pansy at my feet 
Doth the same tale repeat: 
Whither is fled the visionary gleam? 
Where is it now, the glory and the dream? - 


V. 

Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: 
The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star, 
Hath had elsewhere its setting, 
And cometh from afar: 
Not in entire forgetfulness, 
And not in utter nakedness, 
But trailing clouds of glory do we come 
From God, who is our home: 
Heaven lies about us in our infancy! 
Shades of the prison-house begin to close 
Upon the growing Boy, 
But He beholds the light, and whence it flows, 
He sees it in his joy; 
The Youth, who daily farther from the east 
Must travel, still is Nature's Priest, 
And by the vision splendid 
Is on his way attended; 
At length the Man perceives it die away, 
And fade into the light of common day. - 


VI. 

Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own; 
Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind, 
And, even with something of a Mother's mind, 
And no unworthy aim, 
The homely Nurse doth all she can 
To make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man, 
Forget the glories he hath known, 
And that imperial palace whence he came. 


VII. 

Behold the Child among his new-born blisses, 
A six years' Darling of a pigmy size! 
See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies, 
Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses, 
With light upon him from his father's eyes! 
See, at his feet, some little plan or chart, 
Some fragment from his dream of human life, 
Shaped by himself with newly-learned art; 
A wedding or a festival,
A mourning or a funeral; 
And this hath now his heart, 
And unto this he frames his song: 
Then will he fit his tongue 
To dialogues of business, love, or strife; 
But it will not be long 
Ere this be thrown aside, 
And with new joy and pride 
The little Actor cons another part; 
Filling from time to time his ""humorous stage"" 
With all the Persons, down to palsied Age, 
That Life brings with her in her equipage; 
As if his whole vocation 
Were endless imitation. - 

VIII. 

Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie 
Thy Soul's immensity; 
Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep 
Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind, 
That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep, 
Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,- 
Mighty Prophet! Seer blest! 
On whom those truths do rest, 
Which we are toiling all our lives to find, 
In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave; 
Thou, over whom thy Immortality 
Broods like the Day, a Master o'er a Slave, 
A Presence which is not to be put by; 
To whom the grave 
Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight 
Of day or the warm light, 
A place of thought were we in waiting lie;] 
Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might 
Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height, 
Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke 
The years to bring the inevitable yoke, 
Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife? 
Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight, 
And custom lie upon thee with a weight, 
Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life! - 

IX. 

O joy! that in our embers 
Is something that doth live, 
That nature yet remembers 
What was so fugitive! 
The thought of our past years in me doth breed 
Perpetual benediction: not indeed 
For that which is most worthy to be blest; 
Delight and liberty, the simple creed 
Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest, 
With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:- 
Not for these I raise 
The song of thanks and praise; 
But for those obstinate questionings 
Of sense and outward things, 
Fallings from us, vanishings; 
Blank misgivings of a Creature 
Moving about in worlds not realised, 
High instincts before which our mortal Nature 
Did tremble like a guilty Thing surprised: 
But for those first affections, 
Those shadowy recollections, 
Which, be they what they may, 
Are yet the fountain-light of all our day, 
Are yet a master-light of all our seeing; 
Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make 
Our noisy years seem moments in the being 
Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake, 
To perish never: 
Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavor, 
Nor Man nor Boy, 
Nor all that is at enmity with joy, 
Can utterly abolish or destroy! 
Hence in a season of calm weather 
Though inland far we be, 
Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea 
Which brought us hither, 
Can in a moment travel thither, 
And see the Children sport upon the shore, 
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore. - 

X. 

Then sing, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous song! 
And let the young Lambs bound 
As to the tabor's sound! 
We in thought will join your throng, 
Ye that pipe and ye that play, 
Ye that through your hearts to-day 
Feel the gladness of the May! 
What though the radiance which was once so bright 
Be now for ever taken from my sight, 
Though nothing can bring back the hour 
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower; 
We will grieve not, rather find 
Strength in what remains behind; 
In the primal sympathy 
Which having been must ever be; 
In the soothing thoughts that spring 
Out of human suffering; 
In the faith that looks through death, 
In years that bring the philosophic mind. - 

XI. 

And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves, 
Forebode not any severing of our loves! 
Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might; 
I only have relinquished one delight 
To live beneath your more habitual sway. 
I love the Brooks which down their channels fret, 
Even more than when I tripped lightly as they; 
The innocent brightness of a new-born Day 
Is lovely yet; 
The Clouds that gather round the setting sun 
Do take a sober colouring from an eye 
That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality; 
Another race hath been, and other palms are won. 
Thanks to the human heart by which we live, 
Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears, 
To me the meanest flower that blows can give 
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears."

Sonnets from the Portuguese

III

Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart!
Unlike our uses and our destinies.
Our ministering two angels look surprise
On one another, as they strike athwart
Their wings in passing.  Thou, bethink thee, art
A guest for queens to social pageantries,
With gages from a hundred brighter eyes
Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part
Of chief musician.  What hast thou to do
With looking from the lattice-lights at me,
A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through
The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?
The chrism is on thine head,--on mine, the dew, -
And Death must dig the level where these agree."

shut your eyes, they don't do you any good.

silliness! but damn, i slept like a rock."

i want french toast or pancakes. or bread pudding from challah bread.

elevenpm cravings? granted, i haven't eaten much today, looking back, and did a ton.

why do commutes that usually take only 3.5 hrs (most days) turn into five when i'm most tired?

sigh.


(whoa, this post is so inane compared to others of recent yore. i sorta like it)."

"event","my fever got worse last night, couldn't sleep or anything, dosing with tylenol to keep it down. i just wanted to die at one point, drifting between whole body pain, my right thigh (for some reason) would tighten and feel like needles and my heart would beat so hard i could hear it through the mattress, and getting so hot i felt like i would throw up (i was adamant about not throwing up because the doctor yesterday kept making sure i hadn't thrown up).

out of the blue, at like four am, it broke, completely. i don't know what sensation is better: pain suddenly ending, or a fever suddenly breaking. i fell asleep and slept for four hours straight. in all the old movies when someone would get sick it'd be such a huuuuge thing when a fever broke. now i know why. the calm that's portrayed following a fever breaking is true to life. i slept like a baby, the nightmares/dreams stopped, my body was still. it's almost surreal. i can't believe i took care of myself through the whole thing. getting water for me, at 3 i had to get a slice of bread because i had to take fever meds again. monitoring my temperature, shifting positions so i could breathe. fucking hell, i feel great that i took care of myself. it doesn't matter that i'm sure everyone has had to take care of themselves when sick, but i feel so proud and good about it.

yay me!

(and thank god i feel a whole lot better)."

"event","i'm doing a lot of self-care to try and conquer this malady that's got me burning up. sometimes i'm so cold and achy that i can't move for fear of my pants rubbing on my skin (feels like they bruise me) and other times (when the tylenol kicks in) i'm so hot, i'm sweating and burning and want to take all my clothes off and peel off my skin.

water, warmed applesauce, pear, cream of rice with milk, more water. i'm going to bed in a few minutes. i'm going to watch a movie for a little while, to relax, but it'll be on my laptop so i'll be able to turn it off in a snap (literally).

i got some electrolytes from 'vitamin' water earlier, and hopefully my stomach won't feel uneasy tomorrow and i'll be able to eat some semi-fresh (since they'll be a day old) veggies from organic farmer's market! 

alright. good night. try to rest easy, all you sickies out there. i hope the morning brings better tidings in your bodies."

"event","same person, same dream,

just different people getting hooked on that insane stream. it makes me helleciously sad to see it going down one more time. charisma doesn't ever end, can't blame them, can we? 

sully this and sully that, what's a little dirt on my rice pat?

anyway, shouldn't start the day out in such a negative manner. the clouds are nearly purple, gorgeous tint, and i woke up early on my own perogative. there's tea steeping beside me, and an old man in the kitchen. today, even though it's cloudy, will be filled with laughing and talking, and i'm even taking my new 'pyromaniac' <a href=
""http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/10160000/10166696.jpg"" target=""_blank"">journal</a> to maybe get some co-writing done, just like the old days. i have an extremely runny nose, and feels like there's a ton of fluid in my neck. how i can have fluid in my neck, i don't know. it's stiff and hurts like a mother. i did stretching this morning to try and help, but it didn't. and my mom ALWAYS took us to the doctor when we got like this: sore, running nose, sore throat, joint aches, slight headache, earache.  

ugh. i hate going to doctors. i won't and i'll just curl up the majority of the day with tea or soup. :] yay!"

"event","ups and downs. made a cup of tea and am waiting for it to cool enough for me to drink it. bed will be early tonight and hopefully up early tomorrow as i'll have to cook lunches and dinners for myself. something is missing from my life and i'm not quite sure what it is. throw in one factor and everything upheaves like a person prone to seasickness. 

i think, though, that it'll all be alright. i was really upset by a person today, and i felt really bad. drama. i don't feel so swamped by school right now, and next week seems fairly manageable. saturday i'm going out with sami (yay!) and hopefully after my homegroup i'll go out with a newcomer or my sponsor.

i've been feeling really spread out and stretched thin. like these last few days i haven't had a chance to think clearly or have a little bit of time to myself where i wasn't rushing to school, to do homework, to bed, to work, to a meeting. 

time management. but you know, whatever. i'm learning. i'm learning. 

i bought dark city today and the motorcycle diaries, i miss old times of watching movies together with the H peeps, now back in my home state. i miss my family a lot too. i told my dad i wished i could come home. my days are becoming routine, and i don't really want that to happen, and i don't have much contact with my closer friends, which i don't want either. 

i called matt today and we had dinner. a good long one, and talked together and were company. our birthday's aren't too far apart, so we decided to split the difference between them and celebrate them both together as our mutual 'no longer a teenager' birthdays.

it's scary for me. i'm ""growing up"" and still so very young. there's a lot i don't know yet and won't ever know. sort of a sense of shame around that. working in the nonfiction/history/biography section of the store at times makes me so aware of my ignorance. 

i'm trying to realize that i <i>am</i> surrounded by friends. my days seems so empty, though, of that marked honesty that accompanies being friends with someone. the ability to let down a few boundaries and not be on-guard against the world at large. i don't feel stupid asking matt about current affairs and asking knight to explain more on his idea of interconnectedness while still using post-modernist ways of thinking, responses blah blah. and i realized today, in lessons, that my teacher doesn't get frustrated with me for being clumsy at the keys. she's there to teach me, and she's really nice, so i don't need to get down on myself, just practice some so i don't trip so much. the world <i>isn't</i> out to get me. 

yeah, that realization keeps dawning on me. the world isn't out to get me. there are few things that i ""need"" to take personally. good things are good things, and sometimes come disguised differently than i'd like.

i have a thought, though, that a friend of mine just isn't really feeling goodly toward me. but i must let it rest and keep on going. if there's a problem, it will eventually be aired. i don't want to have to ask people anymore if there's something wrong. i'm not psyhic or anything, and i can't know what's going on if i' not told. and if i'm not told, and i don't want to intrude, dabble, or anything like that, i'm just going to let it rest for a while.

what a marked sadness on my soul right now. just feel sick in the heart. like i would like a hug. funny that, though, because alicia called me and just told me she  loves me, my dad called me, my grandma called me...i need support and here it is, coming my way.

not every day will be a good day, but tomorrow doesn't have to bed like today. and every 'one of those days' goes on closer to night, and night leads to a new beginning.

(paraphrased from a children's book i read tonight)."

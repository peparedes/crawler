"event","<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">so guys, you hear it on the news, in
the magazines from your mom, ""the number one new years
resolution this year <i>is fighting the battle of the bulge </i>and
we have some tips for losing those extra inches and gaining tons of
self appreciation""<br>FUCKING BLAH you know actually how many
people stay true to their new years resolution less than 10%, that is
so sad, well this is what i am doing, and what i had planned to do
since i found out my surgery was over Christmas break. my current
weight is roughly 185 to 187 (depending on my mood) and my lowest
weight was 165, i was so happy, i had a lot of confidence and i felt
more attractive especially around Brandon, because i was proud of
myself.<br>after my knee gets better, my goal is to reach my once
lowest weight and i will be fine, but if i reach get to 170lbs i will
still be happy, because i should! be motivated enough to lose those
extra 5 pounds.<br>but, since i had had surgery it is easy to say i
might have gained more fat while losing muscle mass so i don't quite
know where i stand, i would just like to start back and lose as much
as i can and i know i will do it as soon as my knee gets healed, i
plan on starting soccer again, but regardless if i do or not i will
lose my weight by any means necessary, healthily of-course, but i
will do it.<br><br>another resolution is to have another great,
happy, healthy year with my wonderful and compassionate boyfriend and
i wish for many more to come. <br>i also want my grades to get
better, usually i have problems with the first semester, getting back
into the routine of things and i know that is a long time to bounce
back but for some reason my second semester is the better one.<br><br>now
the next step (which was planned today but my mother forgot it at
Wal-mart) is to get a BRIGHT NEON color foam board such as pink,
yellow, or lime green. i will write mt resolutions on it, and put it
to the back of my door, so every morning i will see it and hopefully
it will stick with me throughout the day. i want these things not too
hard to do or ask for, but unlike those people who don't keep their
resolution i want to be one of the few that does.

"event","ha ha, well i was feeling really weird today driving here was frustrating, i think it has a lot to do with that i was up with jessica and boonie until like...3 trying to get them back together, im not sure what is going on right now, i just tried to call and the cell phone that i am using from my aunt has been shut off, and i dont know why.

     i am in allen right now, brandon and i just got done watching Q as F and it sucked! oh my gos it was horrid, i mean they could have come up with a better finale that what was shown. Mrs. gina bought alot of light bulbs today the pretty ones and brandon and i installed them, while installing them, i guess i pressed a button on the cell and it called this guy named JD, he seemed very nice even though i felt like crap cuz i was talking to him, doing lights, and kaitlyn was bugging me. i will talk to him tomorrow.
     
     so i am leaving sunday at 4 pm no later unless there is a big storm or something... i am so ready to get out of MW it was so peacefull today when i was at brandons pool, it was me (by myself) and like 5 other people but the code to the gate was changed or i was entering it wrong. but i was waiting for him to get home from school, and i went to tan, but it was SO HOT! oh my gosh unreal, but hey, its texas...
     oh and i went to ikea today, found a great parking place but when i was leaving these 2 women fought over my parking space, not beating but verbaly fought, well i am going to go to bed now, i will write later

"event","well i got up today, the kids have totally demolished the house, there were 3 other little chillen in here and i told them to all get out, i cant wait till katy leaves, she persuades trev to do some stupid shit.
yes even thought her mother is horrible she could still go live with my mimi.
oh well w/e

so more in the like of justino 
my grandfathers maid need a place to live, my pappa is ready for her to get out of his house. so she asked my mum if she could put a double wide on out land in front of our house, well that is all fine and dandy until she called back 2 days ago and said she woulden't have enough money for a down payment on her trailer, so she asked my mum if she could HAVE OUR LAND for coladeral! and my mother said yes, of course i raised hell, saying ""how could you, you just gave some land to aunt rhonda so she could use it as coladeral and if she cant make the payments on her trailer, she is going to loose our land, and if! just if we could buy it back, we would have to pay for something that we gave away FOR FREE in the god damn fucking first place!"" (ooooh guys i was so mad) then i said ""well if linda cant make a down payment on the trailer, and she has to rely on her un educated daughter to help her pay bills, what is going to happen when tiffany (her daughter) moves out, linda cant make house payments alone, so the trailer goes back...along with our land"" well we argued, i supported my points and we are NOT giving it away, she can use our land if she would like, but my mum is not sigining the land over...and if she really needs a place to live she would stay with my pappa for a little longer, save up some money, and make the down payment.
BLAH it was a mess, then i wanted to talk to Mr. right last night...yeah we talked for about 5 minutes...no big i know he is busy it will be tough, but we will get through it.

i got some new blinds and pillows for my room, i love them (my blinds and pillows) the blinds let so much light in when i want them to, but they also keep alot of light out, since they're so thick, and my pillows are so soft and comfy i love them.
my room has been clean now for 2 days, we'll see how long that lasts, with this arrangment i think my room will stay a little cleaner. erm... so i've been walking at the track for the past 2 days, and last night i ran a little bit, nothing spectacular just a little to get my heart to beating a little faster. and i had fun with bebe so meh........
i dont know what else to write i think im going to go take a bath, i will talk to you guys later.
loves!

"event","oh my gosh, i've been cleaning in preperation for this weekend, but now im not sure what is going to happen :( 
my mum is going to midland, and i might as well just sleep all weekend, i plan on being tired anyway.
jessica wont be coming over she has some other friends she would prolly rather hang out with, plus the only person my mum will allow in the house isn't comming.

i think i might crawl into bed and turn all the phones off, and just lay there. that way i dont have to deal with people calling and asking me to use my car and whatnot.
now i feel drained and i think i am going to go take a nap...after i get off the phone with him"

"event","hey guys whats up, not doing too uch just in allen at brandons house im having a great time spending time with him and his family, they are so sweet... brandon and i went to starbucks today, and then we went to get him a pedicure and then we went to chipotle a really cool fast food mexican burrito bar type of thing.
then we went to eat at a resturant that had some of my favorite cajun food...crawfish etouffee and afterwords keri took us to bed bath and beyond and i was just going to get a rolling back ball massage thingy, but instead i bought neck massager and a face mask and the rolly ball, apparently keri thought i meant i had no money so she was going to pay for like $50 worth of stuff, and i was like no way! she missunderstood me earlier when i said i had no cash just my card...so i payed for it because i would not make her pay for anything, but the thought was very sweet, and it shows alot about her.
    
    i absolutely adore his mother, i think she is a very kind, but straight forward person (in the good sense)

    kaitlyn...what more can i say except that i want a little girl of my own, i think that the reason i am so sweet to her is because i am partial to girls, not saying that i woulden't love a son...he just woulden't get away with as much :P 

    keri, an awesome person to hang out with, very bubbily and fun...and her boyfriend is pretty cool, today is the first day i've met him and he was as nice as could be.

    brandon...well all of you know what i think about him >:)

i am sad because i am leaving tomorrow, thank god that summer is just around the corner and i hopefully will be able to see him every weekend, or at least every other weekend. by that time i should have some ample amounts of money coming in from arbonne...i just need busniss builders, so anyone over the age of 18 please contact me and i will most deffinatly talk with you, in fact i have this marvelous idea, i shall call sara and possibly go talk to her, she is in the colony right now and that is not too far away, and we can take my car if brandon dosen't want to take his, or if he does not want to go, i will go alone.
well i am leaving the office now and will see you guys tomorrow.

love, justin"

"event","so i am home today, and i have alot to say about last night
we went to the abby last night then we went to oak lawn. I thought it would be a high class gay-bourghood, and it was not, there was drinking and 2 clubs right beside us, station 4, and JR's. station 4 had pretty lights and JR's was just a little scarry, not that i went in, but i felt uncomfy because there were alot of old guys and people i would have never paired up or even thought they were gay, this is why the spread of HIV is happening, because there are alot of premiscuous gay men out there willing to bareback with anyone...i was uncomfy cuz men were looking at me, brandon and i went into crossroads, on the corner or oak lawn and throckmorton and we got a drink and looked in the book store, everything had to do with gay stuff, its ok, but i always think of a bookstore as to have all kinds of literature, but meh it was better inside rather than outside where the crazy army man was throwing a hizzy.
then he called navine and he ditched us instead of coming to hang out, so we left and went to legacy right off the tollway, THAT was what i expected oaklawn to be like, very quiet, very classy, and gay, the streets were made of red brick and it was very classy, i took bunches of pics, we walked around and went to the angelicka theatre and watched finding neverland, and i just loved being with my baby.

FRISCO FRISCO FRISCO FRISCO FRISCO FRISCO FRISCO FRISCO FRISCO FRISCO FRISCO !!!!!!! I GOT FRISCO YAY!!!
i love frisco, collin creek mall is awesome, and omg hagen dahs is soooo good! we walked around the mall for like 2 1/2 hours and it was neat, i think we went friday, then we picked kaitlyn up from school and went home, then went to fridays, where our cool waiter talked and spread gossip with us about elliot, anyways ill be nice.
i am home, i miss allen already, i miss frisco and east plano and allen bowl and everyone in the keown house they all made me feel really welcome, and they are the sweetest.
ummm well my phone just rang...so im going to go

thats all for not, i think i am going to go to bed, i am going to have so much free time on my hands tomorrow, that i have planned something for every hour that i am just sitting.

Dear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me 
And dear my love, haven't you longed to be free 
I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you 
And at sweet night, you are my own 
Take my hand 

We're leaving here tonight 
There's no need to tell anyone 
They'd only hold us down 
So by the morning light 
We'll be halfway to anywhere 
Where love is more than just your name 

I have dreamt of a place for you and I 
No one know who we are there 
All I want is to give my life only to you 
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore 
Let's run away, I'll take you there 

Forget this life 
Come with me 
Don't look back you're safe now 
Unlock your heart 
Drop your guard 
No one's left to stop you 

Forget this life 
Come with me 
Don't look back you're safe now 
Unlock your heart 
Drop your guard 
No one's left to stop you now

"event","well, i had a pretty good birthday..asside from the almost trip to fortworth with my mum, then she got pissed/upset at me and turned arround when we got almost to weatherford, then brandon, trev and i went to fort worth by ourselves, i had so much fun with just us...and uncle brandon:P we walked arround the mall for about 2 hours, then went to borders, and then came home, had a good night, and slept well all cozy and warm. right now my mum is bugging me about the trip to europe...dont get me wrong, i want to g so bad especially sine andrew got to go to italy, but i dont want to go with my step mother. i know i am not going, i have made my choice. i am not going and the only way i would is if i could take someone very special with me...my baby.
so my mum is calling peggy tomorrow to see how much time i have to ""make my decision to go or not"" but what that really means is ""how much time do i have to make up a good lie without pissing peggy off""

>>>>>>>>>>>

so i just got home from town, me and jess had some good cries together, we were talking about how horrible minnie wells tekus is, i hat it here so much, then we were crying about collage and how she does not know if we are going to see eachother ever again after graduation, well that is my sis and i love her, and we have to see eachother, if she is gonna be my babies momma...considering my babies daddy still wants her to be the mommy.
we were crying at sonic, and at brookshires, then we went to walmart, and i bought her stuff.
so anyways, i am gonna go and i will talk to u guys later, bye guys

but i know not to get my hopes up...just like brandon being at my house before i got off the bus...well he was not at my house when i got home, but shortly after he showed up, i love him and i wish i could take him with me...yummm it would be a blast.

"event","well right now brandon is playing the guitar, i love it...he thinks he sounds bad, and yes he may hit some wrong notes, but coming from him i think it is beautiful :P everything about him is beautiful, so why wouldn't i think his mistakes are too?
anyways, him playing the guitar makes me feel all warm inside, it makes me feel safe...as weired as that might sound, but it makes me feel like there is a blanket covering me for some odd reason ok, well i am going to go now

"event","I catalog these steps now
Desicive and intentioned.
Preciese and patterned 
Specificly to yours.

I'm tallented at breathing
Especially exhaling,
So that my chest will 
rise and fall with yours.

I'm careful not to wake you
Fearing conversation.
It's better just to hold you
And keep you pacified.

I'm tallented with reason
I cover all the angles.
I can fail before I ever try.

Try to understand there's an old mistake
that fools will make and,
I'm the king of them
pushing everything that's good away so,
Won't you hold me now? (I will not bend, I will not break)
Won't you hold me now? (I will not bend, I will not break)

I am fairly agile
I can bend and not break
Or I can break and take it with a smile.

And I am so resilient
I recover quickly
I'll convice you soon that I am fine

"event","i love brandon, with all of my heart, i hung up on him not too long ago because i was going to get angry, not at him, with myself because i am wrong, i dont like being wrong, but brandon shows me when i am, i love him, and i think he is the only person who could get away with that, and i love it when he teaches to me, tells me things whether it is a fact, or just telling me about his programs, like his program for his payments for his bill or something that seems so simple, but alot of effort goes into it, which is a program of ""i love jibbles the third"" that changes colors, those things mean so much to me, if i could listen to him lecture i would but when i listen to him teach or go off on a tangent i stop talking and, i am not sure but i get the feeling that he thinks something is wrong because i have stopped talking, when in fact everything is perfect, i am soaking up his words like a sponge...strange, but a good analogy. he is my prince and i love him would trade him for absolutly nothing in the world.

"event","so i was called ignorant, by brandon, he had the right to, becaus ei do not know how to argue, you should not argue something you do not know about, well i got in a arguement about the bible with my mother, and we were arguing back and fourth, i told her that the bible does say that ""man shall not lie with man"" and i so, then they shall be punished, well i told my mother god does not like gay people...she said that was written a long time ago and times have changed.
(brandon this is 4 u) how is one supposed to beleive in the bible, with all their heart, and discard the parts he/she does not like, you cannot throw 
parts of the bible out and then say you beleive in the bible, did you know it is a sin to have sex with a woman who is on her period, well that is how i pourtreyed this verse from ""leviticus 20:18-- If a man lies with a woman during her sickness and uncovers her nakedness, he has discovered her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood. Both of them shall be cut off from her people.""
i could be argueing this with no point, i probibly am but, anyways,i am saying that guys sleep with girls on their period, and those who do have sinned (in GOD's eyes) so why would we discard this information and go about doing it if we beleive the bible whole-heartedly? granted there are some who know this verse and follow it, but i am sure there are some who know this verse and do not follow it. this is simply my beleifs, be a good person, love everyone, be caring and compassionate. people are people no matter what, gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual...they are all people who try to live their life by what feels right to them. i hope that if brandon reads this he will say i have a good arguement, or i prove a point, small steps to try to become a good debator and i can argue not beleiving in some parts of the ""wholy book"" and beleiving in other parts, because if you consider your self a religion, you beleive in that book with all of your passion, every SINGLE WORD...feel free to correct me anyone i am open for discussion

"event","My black backpack stuffed with broken dreams
Twenty bucks should get me through the week
Never said a word of discontentment
Thought it a thousand times but now
I'm leaving home

Here in the shadows
I'm safe, I'm free
I've nowhere else to go
but I cannot stay where I don't belong

Two months pass by and it's getting cold
I know I'm not lost I'm just alone
But I won't cry, I won't give up, I can't go back now
Waking up is knowing who you really are

Here in the shadows
I'm safe, I'm free
I've nowhere else to go
but I cannot stay where I don't belong

In the shadows
I'm safe, I'm free
I've nowhere else to go
but I cannot stay here

Oh, show me the shadow where true meaning lies
So much more dismay in empty eyes."

It's not what it was before 
All these feelings 
I've shared
And these are my dreams 
That I'd never lived before
Somebody shake me 'cause I
I must be sleeping

Chorus
Now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
All the mistakes, one life contained 
They all finally start to go away 
Now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day 
I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed 
To be the person that I am today

These are my words 
That I've never said before
I think I'm doing okay
And this is the smile 
That I've never shown before 
Somebody shake me 'cause I
I must be sleeping

Chorus

I'm so afraid of waking 
Please don't shake me
Afraid of waking 
Please don't shake me"

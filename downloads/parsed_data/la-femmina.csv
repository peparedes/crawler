"event","WoW* this is absolutely crazy! I'm at work looking out my window right now and watching the rain and lightning! I love it! Texas is crazy when it rains! They can't drive, they act like its a freakin blizard!!! I dont understand why b/c its just a little water, but they close down roads and its a $500 fine if you drive past a road block and get stuck! funny huh? I really like it here don't get me wrong, i'm just bored so i have to find something to bitch about! Last night i left my water running while i ran down to my friends room, and we ended up talking for like 30 minutes so when i got back, i saw that water was spilling out into the hallway from under my door! I walk in and i'm standing in water up to my ankles! how crazy is that? Thankfully i have some really great friends here (Bamford, Moss, and Jandrew) they were helping me clean it up! means so much to me!!! if that happened in Ohio, you'd just have to clean it up alone, god knows they wouldn't help! just just take pictures of themselves with a ""boobjob"" in front of that! haha! o well, some people are just crazy! literally, i think i could diagnos ""grandma"" if i had to! its called CRAZY BITCH Disorder! its fatal AND highly contagous!!! she's infecting the whole town! anyway! I'm sort of talking/ hanging out with my TI... isn't that awesome! nothing like it! ahhh :) i'm happy, so very happy right now. all you little kentonites and gophers can say what ya want, it wont phase me at all! 

Name them Sam And Suzie- Mandi! or wait why dont you get 4 rats and name them Rob, Emily, Allison, and Stacy! that would work right? or would that just make you want to kill the critters?"

"event","I'm sitting here at my best air force gal's home in Ector Tx! Its a small little town, almost as bad as Ridgeway... I'm thinking about the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE... Being here makes me miss home a little bit... its nice to actually be at a HOUSE and far away from Lackland! Dont get me wrong i am thoroughly enjoying myself in San Antonio... I just need a break every once in a while! Oh guess what... for all you nosey people who wanna know what i'm doing w/my life.. I'm bar tending! The wonderful state of TX says i only have to be 18 to serve;) and to buy (to serve of course) haha!

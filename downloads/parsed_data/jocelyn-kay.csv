I have to look over some paperwork for school and stuff like that but i'm determined to get out of my house. Your job is to help me a little bit by informing me of any job openings there are in Logan that i might be good at.........or if you hear of any apartments that i might get into that would be great too! Hopefully ones near all of you! YAY! anyways, that's really all for now, and if you do help me....thank you in advance!"

You strive to please others and compromise anyway you can.
War or conflict bothers you, and you would do anything to keep the peace.
You are a good mediator and a true negotiator.
Sometimes you do too much, trying so hard to make people happy.

While you keep the peace, you tend to be secretly judgmental.
You lose respect for people who don't like to both give and take.
On the flip side, you've got a graet sense of humor and wit.
You're always dimplomatic and able to give good advice.

Deep and mysterious, it often seems like no one truly gets you.
Inside, you are very emotional and moody - though you don't let it show.
People usually have a strong reaction to you... profound love or deep hate.
But you can even get those who hate you to come around. There's something naturally harmonious about you.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatcolorgreenareyouquiz/"">What Color Green Are You?</a></div>"

Ultra sweet and innocent, you have a subtle complexity behind your sugary front.
Children love you, but so do high end snobs... when you're brewed right.

"event","So i realize that i'm not very good at keeping up on this whole journal thing, and i apologize to all of you for that because you never really know what's going on with me! It's my fault and i take the blame. So.................feelings? i have none. Life is how it is and i'm dealing with it the best way i know how!
aren't we all? i think so. Maybe i'm just going to have to be a big loser for the rest of my life, and no i'm not really ok with that, but that's what i've got! Shit in one hand and a bigger pile of shit in the other. :D
That's my life thus far everyone and i'll try to let you know when it all changes......if it does."

"event","I hate my life.
I hated high school and i would never ever go back. I love being graduated and not having to get up and go to school every moring worried about wether or not my grades are up and if i have all my homework done, but i really really miss my friends!
I talked to Mel on the phone the other day for about 2 minutes and i saw Bra at The Old Gristmill for about 5 minutes, and i haven't seen Annie or Urka for forever.
I don't even know if Alex, Elise, Bonnie, and Kimber are still alive!!!  All i do now is work, sit around at home with the family, and sleep.......it gets very repetative and redundant......and it's super boring.
I miss the old days when we'd all get together all the time.....or at least once a week....even if it was only for a few minutes!
What happened to us? Why don't we ever hang out anymore? 

Somebody please save me from my life, anybody....please."

"event","So i guess i'm hired at information alliance.  The lady called and told me that my training starts on Friday and she told me that she really likes the ""professional"" way that i typed up my resume!!! So yeah, that made feel super proud of myself.

I really think this job looks like fun, and i still don't know if my mom is going to take the job too..........if she doesn't that's okay, i can find something else.  She really wants this job she found at a nursing home, it pays the same as information alliance, but i guess she enjoys taking care of old people or something!

Rowdy is sick. :(  It makes me so sad because he's always crying and he can't breath because he's all stuffed up.  He has Thresh (sores in his mouth) so his mouth hurts, and he screams when we give him the medicine.....which causes him to choke because he can't breath and it scares me a lot!!  I wish i could make him feel better and i hope he gets better soon because he acts weird when he's all hopped up on his drugs!!"

"event","<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"">So
i quit my job!! After a grand total of 2 days working
there...........pathetic, i know, but i really hated it.&nbsp; I
personally would define it as the worst job ever!&nbsp; I kind of left
Mel there alone though, and i still feel guilty about that (sorry mel).
<br>
<br>
I do however have an interview scheduled for a different job on
monday!&nbsp; It doesn't pay as much as Kelly Services, but close
enough for me!&nbsp; I'll be making more than minimum wage and that's
all that matters to me!<br>
<br>
It's also in Logan so that's a plus!&nbsp; I'm never going to work
graveyard again though......i'd rather take my chances on missing some
hang outs and parties every now and then, than work the graveyard
shift!&nbsp; It felt like i was going to my job twice in one day and
that's just too much.<br>
<br>
Anyway, wish me luck on my up and coming job
interview.........hopefully i get the job and hopefully i can feel
better about it than the last one i had!<br>

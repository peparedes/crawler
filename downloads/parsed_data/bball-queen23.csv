Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore...

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside

"event","Question of the Day:  Who are your true friends??



     I think that a true friend is someone who will get mad at you from time to time because you need it!  I know it sounds kinda odd, but I think that people who are always happy with each other creates a big problem because in the end they aren't really that happy.  There needs to be a spat once in a while, because then you make up and become friends again.  Without those fights, then how would you really be friends, I mean come on most people are friends once they have already hated each other.  One of my friends for the longest time we would have these stupid little fights, then within a few hours we would make up and go hang out.  We could hardly remember what we were fighting about.  
     Friends are funny sometimes.  You know I realized that even when I was fighting with one of my friends, I realized that she was showing me that the reason we were fighting was so stupid and that I was being dumb all without saying it really.  This also proved to me how much I really do love her and miss talking with her every day like we used to.  But on the other hand the main reason we quit talking really was because of her now boyfriend.  I'm afraid that we wont ever be the same because of his attitude toward me.  Of course that is all my fault and I am more than willing to admit that.  I just really want to be friends again, because when all of this went down, I feel like I lost one of the best friends I'll ever have.  I mean I guess we could always hang out when he is busy with something else so that it isn't so uncomfortable.  But then there is that little problem called MY boyfriend also.  He keeps telling me to stay away from her, and her boyfriend.  I try to tell him that I want to be her friend and he just thinks that it is all a setup.  That her and her boyfriend are just trying to watch me fall.  Well, even if that is the case (which I don't think it is) all I can say is at least I tried to be her friend.  Right?
     I just wish that everyone could get along, you know??  To answer my question of the day, I think that your true friends are the friends that are always there for you, the ones who will get mad at you when they are trying to make a major point and you are just being too stupid to listen and understand.  They are also the people who are there when you need them most like when you need to vent and just cry when you need to or when you just need someone to hang out with.  I also just want to say that you need to be careful about who you are friends with and who you choose for a friend.  Also be careful about what you say and do to your friends, because you never know what you might do to just loose them one day.  Trust me I speak from experience!  Love your friends because you never know what might happen to them!"

"event","Why is it that people try so hard to put other people in pain?  I know this sounds all hippie and all but why can't everyone just get along?  I mean I'm not saying that I am perfect, cuz no one is.  I am saying that some people just get off by being jerks to other people.  
     Ok, so every person on the planet has a bad temper, right?  Well some people cannot handle their bad tempers, you know what I mean, when people lash out on other people.  Some people lash out on other things like a punching bag for example.  Other people find a way to deal with their temper.  You know, be passive instead of aggressive.  For example, they write it all down and feel better, or they just talk about it.  Most people, the people I see anyway are more into that aggressive state.  I feel that these people are a little on the confrontational side.  These are the people that want to start fights with other people all the time.  Can we say ""Physco's"".
     Now, I feel that I am a little of both.  I have a tendency of lashing out on people when something happens with someone that I didn't especially like.  For example, I have left some pretty nice voice mails to people; BUT... I don't know  if it is just the person I am or what, or... maybe it is because I have such a guilty conscience.  Either way, I feel so terrible after I leave a message like that, I call back and apologize.  I am not a mean person, sometimes I get mad, sometimes I can get even too!  The only time I get even is if I feel it is needed.  I am the first to tell you that I talk big, but I rarely follow through with my words/plans.  I may say some mean things, but 9 times out of 10, I don't mean them.  I feel bad when people think that I do.  One thing is always true though, I always mean it when I apologize to people.  
     Back to this whole people hating others stuff.  When someone apologizes to someone else, and that someone doesn't accept their apology, I see the non-accepting person as one of those people who just has to be hating someone all the time, and they have no one else to hate at the time so they pick that person who is big enough to apologize in the first place!  I believe that it takes a very big person in the first place to put themselves out there and take that risk of the other person not accepting their apology.  There are a lot of people out there that just can't let things go.  I try to tell myself everyday that if there is something that I can try to make right again that I will do it.  Once again I know this sounds hippie and all, but I have no reason to be mad, I mean come on, how far are you going to get in life if you are always mad?  Where I grew up, everyone was always fighting.  There wouldn't be one day without a fight.  I know what it is like.  I find life to be much better if you can just try to be happy.  I know what you are thinking, ""how can you be happy all the time?""  Well, I know everyone has their bad days, but everyone is aloud those days, but you just have to try to make the best of it.  Life isn't a lenghty process, it may seem like it from time to time, but you just have to live life to the fullest, cuz you never know when it will be gone, or someone else's will be you know?  That is another reason why I don't hold grudges, it is because you never know what might happen.  You could be having a huge fight with your best friend, and then the next thing you know that friend is face first on the ground; dead.  Now what?  How do you feel now that your friend died before you could tell that friend how sorry you were that you were fighting over something like not calling them in 2 days.
     I just want to say to all my friends, then ones I haven't talked to in a while, the ones who think I am mad at them, and most of all the ones who are mad at me for some reason or another, ""I am sorry for me being a jerk, and I am sorry that we were/are fighting for whatever reason it may be, but I love all of you, and I hope that we can be friends again sometime in the future before it is too late."""

"event","Is there anyone licensed to help me? I need a licensed psychiatrist.  I have many problems for starters i am a whore.  I like to have sex with anyone who shows me attention.  Ashley was the best friend that i ever had, she was the greatest person, she was easy to talk to, she was fun, she was funny, and shes hot! And because of her hotness i wanted to do her, but she didn't want to do me she wanted to do my boyfriend.  Now I'm stuck with Eric a lowlife worker at walmart.  Who got demoted because of us sleeping together.  Justin was the best guy ever that i ever had and i was a whore and cheated on him with some asshole from work so i lost justin.  To the greatest fucking girl ever. And after JUSTIN BROKE UP WITH, not like i said earlier that i broke up with him, oh another issues is that i'm a ""fucking habitual liar.""  The guy i cheated with his name was Brad, he gave me a ring and i decided to wear his ring instead of my fiances, because i prefer to make the guy i'm sleeping with happier than my fiance.  I've always been jealous of Ashley, but it's because she doesn't lie and she can stay with one guy and she can keep a guy without having to have sex with him.  Shes gorgeous and skinny and she got my boyfriend, because she's not a whore like me.  I know what i did was wrong, i lied to everybody on here, i never broke up with justin he dumped me because of what i did, and i lied to all my friends because they asked me if i was cheating on justin and i said no.  I am a horrible person and i know it, i just denied it until now because i didn't want to face the truth about myself.  Eric is nowhere as good as justin was in anything.  I fucked all my friends over, i lied and cheated on everybody that mattered to me.  I have no friends except the ones i sleep with.  I should probably get help since this computer and these words can't help me, being so depressed and all i should probably get some real help.  I used to play on peoples hearstrings by crying over everything and i still try and use that but it doesn't work as well now because people are starting to get smart and realize that i'm not what i say i am or what i should be!  Just like i lied when i said his brother sexually assulted me by the way i made that up and everybody fell for it.  I knew i had to tell Justin about Brad so i figured i would fool around with his brother while i was at it that i would make it look like he forced himself on me.  I just want the attention from everybody.  I have major emotional problems, my teacher has even told me so.  I lie to get attention and i want everybody to notice me and my body even if it isn't like ashleys body which is a whole hell of a lot better than mine.  Thats it for now bye"

"event","You know that phrase ""You don't know what you've go til it's gone""?  Ya well I never thought that phrase would be so true.  I was/am so mad at myself for the things that I did to Justin, what I was doing to him, you know hurting him like I was.  I just thought that he would be happier with Ashley, considering the two of them would be together when he wasn't around me.  I never thought that it could or would hurt so bad in my life.  I know that now I have Eric, and he makes me happy, but not as happy as Justin.  I have never been worried about how I feel before, because seeing everyone else happy makes me feel better, but I think it is time for me to be selfish.  I want Justin to be happy, but I want him to be happy with me.  I know we had times, but I just felt like I had to fight with him.  The entire time I was happy, I just felt that I was too happy.  Is there such a thing??  Not with Justin.  I loved how I saw him everyday, how he made it a point to come and see me if I couldn't get to him.  I loved all the cute little things he would do for me.  My favorite one that I will never forget is when we were at the bowling alley and they had a pull-tab machine and he bought me one because of grandpa.  That was the point in time when I knew that Justin was my other half.  He is the only once who can basically tell you what I'm thinking, going to do, want to do.  He is all the things that I'm not!  Together we are a whole, or should I say were.  

     Now Ashley I thought was a pretty good friend.  I miss talking to her everyday.  I feel like I've been stabbed in the back.  I thought we were close enough to the point that I could tell Ashley anything and everything.  I never would have minded if she would have told me that she liked Justin.  I wouldn't have minded one bit, ya it would have made things a little weird, but we could have gotten passed that.  I broke up with Justin not only because I felt like it was killing him to be with me, but because I saw how him and Ashley would look at me when it was the three of us in the room together, or the way Ashley would talk to me.  The night I broke up with Justin, I wasn't going to break up with him until I saw that look on Ashley's face when I walked into the house.  She shot me with the look of death.  That is when I knew what needed to happen.  I just sat there and didn't say much.  I was just wanting to spend time with Justin, and I thought I was going to, until that!  I knew I should have just stuck with my first instinct, and just relaxed and talked to Justin, and hung out, just the two of us.  Then I wouldn't be feeling this way.  I could still be with him and happy.  Instead I am sinking into a depressive state, and I don't want to be here.  I want to be with him.  Knowing for starters that ya, My stupid, dumb, bitchassed sister was right!  Justin and Ashley are together!  

     I know that life is full of challenges, right?  Well those challenges are very stressful. I'll list those stressful things and see if I can't loose some of them to make life a little better.

     1.  Work - My newer boss is a total ass, he makes me do my work plus his work, and every morning when I leave my heart is beating so fast that I feel like I could have a heart-attack(maybe that could kill me!! cool!)

Can't really get rid of that cuz I need to make money somehow, but I could try to change shifts!

     2.  School - although school is done for me until fall, I feel really stressed with the tought that I can hardly afford it.  I am too stupid to even get a degree, why?  Cuz I can hardly handle working and school at the same time, cuz it is double the stress.  The only reason I would go is because I had someone there pushing me to go and would be there for me.

There is a starter, I'll say forget school, I don't need it.  That was easy enough!

     3.  Health - Ok, so it is already hard for me to take care of myself, but I really don't care anymore because Justin always made me, although Eric gives me that look, Justin was always the one to be all like ""Tabitha Jo!""

If I leave that out, then I guess it will help me with the next answer right?

     4.  Me - I hate myself for the things I've done, I can hardly live with myself.  It is worse when I know that I can't trust any of my conversations with Justin anymore unless it is the two of us talking about how much we love each other, cuz he wont tell Ashley that now will he!  Better yet when Ashley calls wanting to know why she is such a bad friend!  And she starts yelling at me, after the fact that I called and left her and her parents a message that I was sorry for everything that has happened and I miss and love all three of them!  Ya, I don't think I need to even be here anymore!  Maybe I should just make it easier for the two of them, since that is my biggest stress, the only way to get rid of it is to get rid of myself!"

"event","Instead of having a question of the day, here is the word of the day:  HYPOCRITE!


     Don't you just love people who tell you that you did something wrong, or what you did made them feel bad, then they turn around and do the same type of thing.  Especially when it is someone that you are suppose to be close to or trust.  I am willing to admit to the mistakes that I have made in the past, and I don't expect people to just forgive and forget, but people make mistakes right?  What I can't handle is when people yell at you for admitting your mistake, lets take lying for example, and then they turn around and lie right back at you, after saying ""Have I ever lied to you?"" just cuz they know you can't remember anything off the top of your head at the moment.  I guess that could also be called playin someone right??
     I find that not telling someone something is the same thing as lying, ok?  First off, I told my boyfriend the truth about something, (I cheated on him) because I thought that he deserved to know the truth, and he got upset, which is understandable.  Well, he kept saying he was ok with it, but he needed a little time to just think about what happened, but we stayed together.  Anyway, he kept getting mad, so I did what he wanted me to do and I broke up with him.  Then he acts like I'm the one who is all hatin on him, when I'm not.  Then he says we can work it out.  So I think cool!  So we have been hangin, pretty much still acting the same (like we are dating).  Ok so I work 3rd shift, which makes it harder to hang out with my friends including Justin, but we have worked around it pretty well, except for the fact that it is ok for him to hang out with friends while I'm at work, but not ok for me to hang out with people when he is at work.  Well, Justin tells me he is going to his aunt and uncle's house which is a few hours away.  He said he wanted me to call in to work sick so I could go with him, when he knew I wouldn't.  Come to find out he decided to go to the basketball game in town.  I mean we aren't dating, but was under the assumption that we were close to dating again.  So you know he decided not to tell me until my sister found out and told him that she was going to tell me if he didn't.  So isn't that like lying???  Everyday he makes it a point to tell me he loves me, and I also love him.  Ya well, then to top things off, he went on a little date to go see a movie that he knows I wanted to go see with him.  Real Cute Justin.  He kept telling me that he can't trust me.  Well, why is he telling me that?  How am I suppose to trust him???
     You know what my answer is to this?  Screw this shit, I don't need this stress I've been having over all of this.  That is probably what made me sick.  I have plenty of guys hitting on me daily, so it isn't like I can't find me a man.  In fact I think I'll make me some plans for my night off with some guy!  Not that I need to.  There are only to guys I need in my life, and that is my Dad and my dog Shadow, I know they are always there for me when I need them the most!  And with the exception of once in a while with my dad, they aren't hypocrites, and they TRULY do Love me!"

"event","Question of the Day:

     Why does it always seem that doing the right thing doesn't turn out to be the right thing after all????




     I thought it would be a good idea to tell the truth, I mean come on, ""the truth shall set you free""...Right?...WRONG!  I guess no matter what happens, I always turn out to be a fuck up, or the ""Big Looser""  I really for once am lost for words.  I don't know how to say it except I guess that when you feel like something isn't right, that something really bad is going to happen, more than likely you are right.  I have felt like something big, or rather bad or both was going to happen.  Little did I know that both were going to happen within a few days of each other.  First, My favorite aunt and uncle decided that they didn't like me anymore.  Then my dad's best buddy died.  Now...Ya, my soon to be husband, well isn't anymore.  
     If this is suppose to be God's little plan for me, well then, fine.  I'll tell you what he is thinking, he is thinking that I shouldn't have love, that I need to be lonely for the rest of my life.  Lonely, and scared.  Well that isn't going to happen if I have anything to do with it.  If I can't have my man that I love so much I guess I will have to be either lonely or dead, cuz I can't live without him.  I don't know what to do.  I know he doesn't really love me like he says, cuz if he did, he would have come after me.  I guess this is the chance he has been waiting for, I just don't understand why he has waited this long.
     
     So, maybe this was the right thing to do if it makes him happy, but then why do I feel that it is so wrong?  ""Ain't life a bitch?"""

"event","Question of the Day:

     Which is worse:  Cancer and possible death, or a bad situation you have to live with for the rest of your life?




     Can people really be too nice?  I didn't believe so until yesterday.  Maybe I am too nice of a person, I mean you can ask anyone, I do have a bitchy side just like everyone else, but I am generally nice to people I meet, and I don't have anything against anyone until they do something stupid to me.  Then it is all about the revenge!!!  
     There are a lot of people in this world that have dumb shit that happens to them and there is nothing that they can do about it.  Most of that stuff happens to people and they sit and ask themselves ""What did I do to deserve this?""  Well, 99% of the time, those people don't deserve what happened to them.  The things that no one can stop, or prevent, you know like cancer and that shit.  I feel really bad for those people because it isn't a life or death situation, it is death with a small percent chance of life.  Where others have just really bad experiences that they have to live with for the rest of their lives.  Now what do you think is worse?  Having to go to hell and back dealing with something like cancer, or living the rest of your life always looking over your shoulder because you are afraid that someone is looking at you with bad intentions?  I would like everyone to answer that question for themselves, and think before they do anything.
     I go to work every night, I talk to just about everyone, I see customers, I talk to them.  I have no problem with doing any of that, why?  I love my job, it's fun, I love to talk to people I work with because I am a friendly person, I like to help people and that is why I help customers and I talk to them.  I never use to have a problem with that...that was until I tried to work after a really bad experience.  My advice is to never do that.  I went to work thinking that I could forget about what had happened earlier that day, but all I could do is think about it.  I didn't want to be at home, didn't want to be at my boyfriends, didn't want to be at work, so where could I go to feel safe and not so scared.  NOWHERE!  I didn't feel like being at my dads, because he would just sit and ask what was wrong, and I didn't want to talk to him about it so I couldn't go there.  I have mixed emotions about everything right now, the way people look at me, what they say to me, I'm scared, I don't know what to do.  I know I need to do something, but what?  I don't want people to be mad at me, but I don't want it to happen again.  I don't want to be touched, I'm scared.  What do I do?  I need to do something, what is wrong with the world today?  
     I am going to ask myself this:  ""What did I do?  Was it my fault, or was it going to happen any way?  If I wouldn't have said something would it have happened?  If I would have just slept instead would it have happened?""  I think I did deserve it some way or another, I had to of done something for God to say ""Here you go, how about dealing with this?""  My friend told me that God only gives us what we can handle, he would never give us anything that we couldn't handle.  So apparently God thought I need that to happen, right?
     So to answer my question about which is worse, I think that either way they both suck, so you either go through life with the pain and suffering, or you are lucky enough to join God when he thinks that you have had enough!"

How come everyone else seems to ""know what is best"" for you rather than themselves?

Ok, for starters, I have mono, so that means no sports for a month.  A MONTH!  THAT SUCKS!  So I have been feeling crapy for a whlie, but I am starting to feel better and mom thinks I need to like never leave the house cuz I have mono, while she just walks in the door from work and cracks open a beer, well you know what mom?  I don't think you should drink!  Does that stop her?  I think not!  Anyway, I think that some people, even the sick people need a LITTLE fresh air once in a while, right?  I think if I am inside too long without going outside while it is still nice, I just might die if I get fresh air.  My dad even said ""Well shouldn't you be resting""  Ya, but I can't sleep all day and night for a week.  That is so not going to happen.  Another thing, I hate it when mom tells Justin to fucking go home or he will get sick.  You know what?  If he gets sick, then it is his own damn fault isn't it?  Ya thought so!

Another thing is why is it when people have bad days that they take it out on other people?  I am as guilty as the next person, but why do we do it?  I believe that it makes some people feel good to yell at other people, my dad is great at that, and so is my sister Jessica.  They are great trying to make people feel worse than they do.  At least when I yell at people when I have a bad day, I try to say that I am sorry that I yelled and that I am just having a bad day and I didn't mean to take it out on that person.  Anyway I think that the whole world could use an attitude adjustment.  Not too many people I know can just say ""Hey, I'm sorry I didn't mean to yell at YOU.  I am just in the mood to yell""  or something to that affect.

To answer my question of the day...  I think it is just cuz people feel that they can try to help by trying to ""Lend"" their advice when really all they are doing is telling you what to do because why?  ""they know best"""

Or better yet I will be paying those fucking bills for the rest of my life, considering no one is willing to help me pay for this crap they are pushing me to do.
     I have always been against smoking, not smoking in general, but smoking myself.  I have always wanted to never take that up.  I think that is all starting to change.  I think I need to just relax a bit and calm down.  I feel like I am being pushed and pulled in every direction.  For instance, I love my boy Justin very much, but sometimes he can be a little much for me, and I don't want to say something to him because I don't want to lose him over something dumb. I need to just sit and spend a few hours alone with him, when I say alone, I mean like just him and I talking, or sitting there, just the two of us, no distractions, no other people, maybe look out at the stars like I always want to do but never get the time to do it because he wants to watch TV or play a video game, or I have to work.  I think that it is just the simple little things in life that I am missing right now.  I just need to sit and do them.  Maybe I just need alone time.  No...that can't be it, because I can't stand to be alone.  That is the feeling that I have been having lately.  That same feeling that I need someone here to do sweet things for me, or just to hang with.  
     I know it isn't Justin, I just don't know what it is, I just feel so empty, and that all my stupid little problems are getting to me.  Like my ticket I got, or college, or my stupid sister who thinks she can tell me what to do.  Maybe in the long run, it is Grandpa.  I need him so bad right now.  Because he could just sit and listen and he wouldn't tell me what to do, unless I asked for his advice on what to do.  I have also borrowed money from him, and the few times I did, he wouldn't let me pay him back.  I miss him so much.
     I have a few friends that would tell me right now that I need to pray, and look to god for help right now.  One specific friend that would say ""God wouldn't do something like that to you if he thought you couldn't handle it.""  If that is the case, why does god hate me then?  I feel like he is just waiting for me to ram my car into a tree.  I feel like I could just do that somedays, I'm not going to, but I just feel like something is missing, rather someone...Grandpa.
     So I guess to answer my own question...you don't really know, because you are never really sure what exactly it is you are crying about!"

I have done that before, but it was just my license, and it was for like 3 days, but it was no big deal, because its not like it had anything real important in it because I'd be getting my new license in a week.  Well this time I lost my wallet that has my check card in it, and most important of all, my boyfriends college money!  Ya, I feel like crawling into a hole and dying right about now!  He says things like Its not your fault.  Ummm... ya right!  I know he is just trying to be calm about it, but I know that deep down, he is so pissed off at me that he could probably kill me.  When people say ""I felt like an inch tall!""  Ya, I feel like a millimeter tall, if that.  I am going nuts trying to figure out where that god damn wallet could possibly be.  I know it will be the last place I look (duh! obviously) but I am going crazy trying to think where I left it!  I just keep praying for it to magically appear out of no where.  Think it will happen?  I hope it does!"

My supposed good friend tells me that I spend too much time with my best friend, also known as my boyfriend.  This coming from him who used to be my best bud, whom I hardly ever see.  I think that people sometimes say these things out of a jealous rage!  Some people just need to get a grip.  Just because he can't spend time with his girlfriend because her parents hate him, doesn't mean he can bash my relationship which I think is going a million times better than all of his relationships combine.  In fact I can tell ya word for word what he keeps telling me over and over again ""You guys spend too much time together, and it will hurt you in the long run and you know it!""  And on the other hand, his best friend who is my stalker tells me that if its not broke, don't fix it!  Ya I am thinking that there is a problem with this picture.  He along with plenty of other people in the world need to get a grip on life!"

"event","Once again it is a Friday night and what am I doing?  Thats Right!  A big fat nothing!  I just want to know what is wrong with me in the significant other department??  Not that it really matters that much, but I can't even get a date with a kid that likes me?!?!?!  What is wrong with that picture?  

What is life really about anyway?  Is it to live, or is it to die?  What is God's plan for everyone?  Does he really have the same plan for everyone, or do some people's lives just need some adjustments?  Whatever, I think that mine is needing a few more adjustments, or maybe I need some just plan fixin!  People are like cars.  No really if you think about it's true!  Some people seem to be perfect on the outside, but on the inside they are a mess.  Then you have the people who look like wrecks, but on the inside they are in tip-top shape.  Then we have the people who look great one day, and then the next, BAM! there is a dent that needs fixin, they need someone else's help to put them ""back on the road!""  And last but not least, we have the people who looked good at one point in time, but then one day something happens, and they never get fixed!  Here is the best part...  Sometimes you can find a great ride!!!!!  Ha ha ha.  

It is great to know that all our sports teams don't suck!  Kinda like our girls bball team, ya I don't know what that season was, but what I do know is that it wasn't Basketball!  Now our guys on the other had just received their 4th district championship in 4 years!  That makes them The Shit!  Why do girls suck so bad, I mean why can't they be more like guys when it comes to sports.  If you hate eachother or something happens, you duke it out.  No, not girls they just sit and bitch about it the entire season.  NOT ME!  I wanted to punch half of my so called teammates (ya what team?????).  The only reason I didn't was because I didn't want to be kicked off the team because of it.  But I do have to admit that it was funny when the ""golden girl"" of our school got an MIP the week before volleyball districts... what a great senior representative we had for the team!  Way to go!!!

All I have to say is that the world is one messed up place and I wish that all I had to do was wiggle my nose and make things go the way I want them to, but we all know that isn't happening, so I guess that life just sucks sometimes, and you just learn to deal with it, Right??"

"event","Ya, who says that family can't be fun??  I am hanging out with my little cousin Alyssa.  We are havin' fun downloading music and doing dumb shit.  Fun fun!!!  It is a friday night and neither of us have anything to do, ya we are real cool huh?  I must say though, it is much better than sitting home alone on a fucking friday night doing nothing besides watching some stupid movie that makes me feel like an even bigger loser because I don't have a boyfriend or other friends to hang out with.

Here is an issue for yas, what is up with people and that stupid atkins diet?  Don't they know that in the long run it is bad for you?  Not having carbs is limiting your energy, since your main energy source is from carbohydrates.  Besides, once you put back in all those carbs that you took out of your diet, you will gain back all that weight that you lost.  So what is the point.  I know that people want some easy fast way to loose weight, but people need to learn to accept themselves, and not care so much about what other people think.  Our whole world is based on advertising and marketing where everyone needs to be a size 2 instead of 12.  Of course if someone doesn't like the way they look and they want to change it, then good for them, because then they are doing it for themselves instead of to please someone else.  

I think that people just need to chill.  Like me, when people at my school look at me because I am friends with a girl they hate, I just brush it off my shoulder, after I tell them to grow up and learn to treat people the way they want to be treated.  I mean come on, didn't we all learn that in first grade?  Ya thought so.

People just need to learn to get along, thats all.  I know that sounds really, really, corny, but that would be nice if people learned to just let all that stupid shit go, and grow up a little.

Oh ya, and what is up with this lame thing called valentines day, it is just some lame day that the card and flower companies invented.  DUMB!  I am only in this mood because I don't have anyone to be my valentine,  this sucks!!"

Today I found out that I am a dumb idiot for starters, then my neighbor gets into a bad car accident (luckily he is ok), next I find that someone at school hit my car, (that stupid son of a bitch, whomever it was,) then mom's boyfriend has to be taken to the ER because of kidney stones.  Thank god it is the end of the day.  It was one hell of a monday.  I know it could be a whole hell of a lot worse, but it started off just fine except for the fact that I couldn't get up this morning.  Oh well it is an end of a shitty day, maybe tomorrow will be a better one!?!?!?!"

I know that some of those dreams are a little too real.  They can scare me, but then again they are just dreams, or are they?  I don't know, I just know that when I have dreams about certain people it trows me for a huge loop.  I could be going loopy myself, but who knows????"

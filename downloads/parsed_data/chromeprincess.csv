My brother works at a gas station not your most holy of joints. Yet and still as my Mom had put it when we were young be a blessing where you are because that is where it is needed.
My brother warmly greets each customer with a smile like seeing a long lost friend and many become just that, friends. He sends every customer out the door with one phrase. &quot;Have a blessed day&quot;
Many of us that have worked in customer service would flinch at that because many a customers say it at the end of screaming at us in their final form of self righteousness.</i></font></div><div><font style=""color:#333333""><i>Yet, when my brother speak that simple sentence he does it with a true prayer in his heart for you, that you truly will be blessed by the God he knows and loves. As children of the risen savior, Christ Jesus we are called Christian because we are to show Christ&#39;s love to the world. My brother does this daily. </i></font></div><div><font style=""color:#333333""><i>Today someone told him that he shouldn&#39;t be saying &quot;have a blessed day&quot; because he wasn&#39;t in a house of worship, my brother asked back where ever I am is a house of worship.
From anyone else I would roll my eyes, but not from Dean.
So to the person who called my brother out on his prayer and blessing to you. I say I hope his prayer will echo in your heart and maybe his response as well so that you will see that blessings aren&#39;t just for churches and saints, but for sinners, truckers, kids, all the people of this earth and most especially for one dude at a gas station praise his savior and praying for everyone to have a blessed day</i></font></div>"

"event","Today I sit at my triangle (yes triangle) where I work there are no cubes, we don't deserves cubes we get triangles. Management gets cubes, but even they must share them. I sit in my triangle of awesome surround by my papers and furry friends that keep my company through the repeat calls from across the country. The calls are all about the same, the people however are not. Which honestly I thank goodness for because otherwise I would probably go looney. So people hate the crazy callers, the overly nice old ladies, the people you can't even guess what they are speaking, not me. Every single one is a woot and a half to me. I answer the phone with the happy cheerful voice which disarms 98% of the most angry person, who are still pissed, but now are apologizes to me for their emotional state because ""you are such a sweetheart and it's not your fault"". Yes, I know it's not my fault, but I do agree it sucks, yet in a world where everything is man made everything will break. 
Hell, even the things not man made will break. The human heart made by a great creator, who in his stupidity or wisdom made it so breakable it crashes apart like glass. I can never decide if it was made that way so we would know that love is to be taken care of and treat gentle or because he is a sicko who likes watching people suffer. Six: one, half dozen: the other."

"event","After helping unpack books for the book sale this weekend I got some serious hate throw at me for ""helping kill babies"" it broke my heart but, not in the way a lot of people who think. I'm uses to hearding the usual from the right but, this phrase is what got me ""no good reason to support Planned Parenthood"" This is why that hurt so very much when repeatly said by people who are suppose to be family.


 In the winter of 1982 a woman of 37 found out she was with child. Her husband and her were not planning for another child and with her husband being 52 they would be aging parents. The doctor suggested she have an abortion because of her age it wasn't medically safe. The doctor gave her little information on why it wasn't safe or options just planned for the abortion to happen. Yet this woman knew of a Planned Parenthood and went there for more information cause she was scare. She was told ALL the choices she had and what the dangers really were in having a child at her age and with the power of EDUCATION she made her decision. On Sept 30th 1982 in Boone, Iowa a little baby girl was born that without Planned Parenthood wouldn't have been. So thank you to Planned Parenthood for giving woman the whole story on their choices and helping them decide what's right for them."

Usually something that strikes me as different - a piece of jewerly about 80% of the time.

chromeprincess comes from two things actually a fingernail polish and a phrase.
The fingernail polis was chrome purple and my polish of choice for almost a year. I love all the chrome polishes in general but the purple is my 100% favorite. So you get chrome from that.
Princess comes from this bit. All girls are princesses and should be treated as such. I love that idea. Especially since I have always felt like Cinderalla who never found her prince.
I put them together, the one thing that always made me smile and something I wanted to be so badly.
I still wish for the princess thing but I know it won't ever happen because for me that isn't an option for long. Even a guy with the best intentions can't do it. I quicklly get pocketed to the friend or the object pile and that's where I live. I still where chrome polish now and again. It still makes me smile.

If I was to change it I would probably go with delovelydeangel which is my email and my xbox 360 name. Delovely is the name of a movie about Cole Porter - he wrote musical. I <3 musical especially his and de is the first part of my name and angel is my lot in life. I am needed in life. I don't come to mind unless there is something for me to do and I am always a friend. Yet angels usually spend their lives watching and alone. Very fitting. I would say."

I get $5 if you sign up this way...basically they send you emails, you scoll to the bottom mark you have read it and get 5 cents I know doesnt sound like much but, last year I made $50 off of it and just click on read e-mails. There are offers too on the main page which you dont have to visit but, can so if you do buy stuff online you can make a lot more than $50. So yeah I need money, dont we all, so if you want sign up for Inbox and uses this link so I can get some money out of it. *hug* thank you.

18 out of 274,000 teens kill themselves
1 in 5 teens consider (think) suicide.
1 in 6 made plans
1 in 12 had attempted suicide
8 out of 10 ask for help before the commit suicide

THE PAINS NEEDS TO END NOW.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting on Sunday write the word Love (in any language) on your Forearm.
Please invite as many people as possible.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
TWLOHA = To write Love on her arms (see TWLOHA.com)
The point is not to advertise peple to go to or use this group for help although if you need or want to then do so. they are a great group of people for a great cause but, the point is t let people know that people hurt and when it gets to the point where they are so low that the need a life line we can be there to help them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I am going to start a group called ""I faced Death and chose love"". So primary goals as this group but its mostly so i can but the pictures from this event somewhere. Also let me know if you have a beter idea for a name.

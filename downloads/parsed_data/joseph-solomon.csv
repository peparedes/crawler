"event","<p>I woke up, and knew she's very close by. Strangely, the sympathy from the full viniculim is silent. Confused I get up, and walk outside, there's a large black SUV, sitting in the yard. Red, Sara's driver and jet jockey, is leaning against it, having a cigarette, her face strained and her aura saying ""WORRY"" She pats the side of the vehicle, and Alycia and Andi get out. Alycia has obviously been crying and Andi is just barely managing to hold it in. Alycia looks at me and cringes, She's afraid I'll see something before they have a chance to explain. She opens the back of the vehicle, and there, carefully covered is Sara's body, laying in torpor. Her face is streaked from where she's cried blood tears, her face caught in an expression of emotional pain, from where I stand I can't see a mark on her. Her fists are tightly clenched though. Alycia looks at me as the tears start to flow again, ""She....she said if this ever happened to her....to bring her here and you would take care of her....."" </p><p>I just stand there for a few minutes looking at her, fear and dread weighing heavy on my soul, finally I have to ask. ""What happened ladies? I need to know before I have her awakened.""</p><p>They start to babble at me, piecing together a story between the 3 of them. Honestly I'm not paying much attention since I know what the problem is. Judas, he's done something so greatly stupid I'm going to have to kill him. I get that he visited, they argued, she went for a walk, laid down and didn't wake. The ghouls paniced and brought her to me. Useful, maybe I should get a pair of my own. I flip open my phone and call William, I really don't like him, but he's the most potent blood I know. He takes his bloodly time ariving for a couple seconds of his times. Before he leaves he reminds me that I owe him for this, blood hungry bastard. </p><p>""Ok Ladies, I'm taking Sara out back, if you try and follow the house will turn you back. I suggest you get that big bus off my yard before it eats the wheels."" I know my beast is showing to them, they are white, pale and afraid. They suspect that I blame them for her sleep. I pick her up, and think that she's so light. As we're walking back to the gardian Hannoman drops on her chest and I smile, the little creature purring on her chest. I sit her down on one of the chairs.</p><p>""So, Who am I killing my wife?""<br />Her face answers me, even though he hurt her enough to make her not want to wake she doesn't want him dead. Well, that'll make life difficult. I look at her for a moment ad she holds her arms out. I draw her into mine and sing songs my grandmother taught me. Soothing words in Hindi while the smell of blood from her tears fills the night, only my love's aura telling me she has not fallen into the sleep again. I hear the ringing of metal on the stones of the garden, but don't let her go to look. Instead I take her ring hand into mine comparing our rings. Her's smooth as the day it was cast, mine already holding signs of violence. The words are simple, they actually do come from the heart, but my mind isn't listening to my voice. I'm already considering what I need to do to remove this threat to my wife, even though she does not want that to happen, even though if she found out she would be angry, even bear me hate. He'll die for this. She's talking now, telling me she was wrong, that it is only me that she loves, she says she's sorry, and I know my lips say the kind and loving words but my mind is thinking why? Why shed tears over this? Break him, shatter him, kill him and be done with it. Judas should know better, he is an Acolyte, he exists in this relationship under MY sufferance and he has abused his invitation. He will die for this. </p><p>Her fangs are in my neck, the pain is amazing, it feels like my soul has been showered with acid, and ripped with razors. It's a constant battle with my beast to stay and accept the flaying. The animal in me wants to run, to flee, to scream it's suffering. But I pound it down, she will not know that I would flee her if I could. That this is the worst pain I have ever felt. She can never know that I want to die under her teeth.</p><p>With a sigh she pulls back and my body relaxes. Then she asks me to hurt her, saying that it may sound odd, fear that I will hate her or be sickened written in her soul. My only response is to push my excitement to the back and ask. ""How much? And do you have a prefrence for how?"" She says until she no longer loves him and my mind is already planning what to do. </p><p>I stand up and offer her my hand. Once she takes it I lead her back to the back of the house and through a book case. Inside is a very clean room with strange and unusual items, many types of torture devices she'd recognize but some she would have no clue what he uses for. I takes her to the center of the room and locks her legs into a set of manicles, then pull her arms over her head to do the same. I step away and hit a switch, pulling her off the floor until she's streached tight and her shoulders and hips scream from the tension in them. I take my razor and cuts her clothing from her body, and look her over. While I'm examining her for the procedure, Hannoman is reading the tools I will use, he is quick, silent and the perfect servant. Finally I stop in front of her. </p><p>""This is your last chance my love. Past this I will not stop until I am done. There is no safe words here, only pain."" I work to keep my voice emotionless, and my face cold and inhumane. She can not know my excitement at this.</p><p>Her face is cold, as is her voice ""I trust you my love, not to kill me. I am strong, and I submit to you."" At this point I am glad I am not alive, there would be no conceling my lust.</p><p>After she speaks the words I turn away and walk up to the wall and turn a tap. Water begins raining from the ceiling onto her body after giving her a minute to get good and wet I walk up and touch the lines of pain I see in her soul one hand, and then begins to cut, shallow traces all over her body, following the pattern of the pain. After I've gotten it outlined it's a quick yank and the strips of skin lift right off from where I've flayed her. The water hits the wounds and I know the pain that explodes through her, salt mixed into the water grinding into the wounds, sharp and stinging, forcing her pain to the surface.The sting of the salt getting lighter and lighter as she gets used to it. I move back to the wall and flip the switch for the hot water and watch as her whole body begins to dance under the scalding hot water that is now flowing over her. After several minutes of this I switche the water to cold again, soothing her screaming nerves. Letting her nerves rest, but only for so long, next is the acid, it's very weak, would not burn through skin, but her skin has been removed. Patterns of burning red appear all over her body, pain brought to the surface. I become aware of her moaning, writhing, but she has not screamed yet. This is sad, she should scream, it's good for her, it will let the pain out from her lungs and heart. I think for a few moments and decide that I will try what worked on Sophia, I turn the flow of liquid off and walks up to her, my hand tracing the lines I've carved into her skin, I touch her lips with my finger, in a shushing motion and then presse the sponge attached to wires into the hollow of her throat. Electricity explodes through her, tracing through the flayed flesh, grounding through her wrists and feet. I drag the sponge over her body, my face emotionless and cold as he watches her whole body vibrate and spasim. She can not know that I find her beautiful with blood flowing from her mouth where she's bitten her tounge, her eyes bulging from her sockets, and blue fire dancing in her pain. Finally after I've ran the sponge across the soles of her feet, I shove the sponge into her vulva for what feels like forever, the tension having built to the point my release is sudden, but not unexpected at her exclaimation of pain. Still no screams though, we will have to get creative then. </p><p>""You should heal my love. This is only the foreplay."" </p><p>After making sure she has healed herself I turn and take my braded steel whip from the wall. I only take 1 step foward before flicking the whip back and putting my entire shoulder and back into the first lash. The whip digs deep, and cuts hard, the metal unyeildig and jagged. 8 more lashes follow the first, and then a final 10th, the last one laying open a deep gash from breast to upper thigh. I walk up to her and slice deep into her flesh just under her sternum, reaching inside with my hand and grabing her heart in my hand and squeezes it hard, several times.I back away and taste the blood I have squeezed from her heart, so good, so strong, the beast whispers that we should just rip it out and eat it, instead I begin pulling her intestines from the hole I made, not stopping until I have them all outside of her body. Once they are all on the floor I cut them from their connecting points and disposes of them in a fire. After some work with the winches I have her about waist high and on her back, still chained , all of her weight pulling at her hips and shoulders. Once I have everything secure I very unceromoniously dump a jar of scorpions into her stomach cavity.</p><p>She will scream, Oh yes. My thoughts are manic, even though I know my face is like a mask. I need that scream from her, that utterance that says she has broken, that her limit has been passed.</p><p>I step back and brushe her body with the sponge, the scorpians go insaine with the jolt of electircity, and begin trying to find ways out of her. Crawling all through her body, every few seconds I brushe her again and they go insaine, stinging her again and again. She feels them sting her heart, lungs, kidneys, one breaks through her stomach and begins crawling up her throat, stinging as it goes. I finally presse the sponge into her for several minutes, killing every scorpian inside of her. When I'm done and sure that they are all dead I walk up and wipe the blood from around one of her eyes with my finger, licking it from my finger tip, rich, coppery and salty from the aquious humor leaking from her eye. </p><p>""I give my students a break here my wife. To feed, heal and clean themselves out. We will begin again in 1 hour. Be back here and ready."" </p><p>I unhook the chains and lets her fall to the floor. I turn to the Hannoman and we begin cleaning up the room. While she is gone I call my pain, I give it form and substance. She will scream are my thoughts, even if I have to give her everything I have. She returns, beautiful, ready, my willing victim, she's pulled her hair back and stands ready for more. I seal the door behind her as she comes in. From the spirit world my pain grips her, every muscle creaking with strain almost like they are trying to break her bones. Blood beings leaking from her fingers and toes, as tissue rips and tears. Forever passes as this pain from an unknown source feels like it is ripping her completely apart, just at the point she feels she is going to die frm the pain it stops. Her screams, my Goddess her screams, she howls like a lost thing, like death it's self is ripping her limb from limb. He body dances on the ground, trying to escape pain she can not see, and does not know where it is coming from. I keep my face a mask, for she must not know that I want her more now than I ever have. After this first course it shows it's self to her, covered in spines, razors for fingers, it hisses and and points back to her. Loudly in my head I can hear it ask for more, beg to be allowed to make her scream more and more, I nod and open a vein with my razor, my blood sealing the bargin for what the creature wants anyway. The creature turns, crome steel teeth showing in a rictus grin of pleasure as it dives back into her body. The pain begins again. This time the pain builds until she's sure she's going to die from it, then disolves completely, leaving her sweating blood on the floor. I watch her lay there trying to move. I let her stand on her own, it's important that she do it, I see my pain dive into her as she stands on her own, dropping her to the floor to twist and scream on the floor again. After hours of this the creature comes from her body like smoke. It thanks me for a chance to play and leaves, I lean down and picks her up in my arms. I walk her over to the shower, and turn it on, washing the blood and pain from her body. I carry her to the table and lay her down, placing my hand against her shoulder and push her into the table, not that I expect she has much strength to resist me, I just need to make sure that she does not move and ruin this. The brand is white hot as I press it into her inner thigh, leaving my mark there so that any who come after will know this is mine, and they enter only on my sufferance. It's all I can do to keep from riping my clothing off and taking her now. But it would ruin the brand, and should she wish to keep this new scar I would like it to be perfect. </p><p>""We are done for the evening my love. You are free to sleep where ever you wish. I will understand if you do not want to share a bed with me this evening.""<br />I turn and open the door into my chamber, and walk in. Honestly not sure if she'll follow or not, once there I lay on my cool bed, in complete darkness, I feel more than see her come into the room and I smile. She is truely mine. I take her into my arms and feed slowly, giving her pleasure to go with the lingering pain I know she feels. I have hurt her tonight, I have torn screams from her and broken things inside of her.</p><p>She must never know how much I wish to do this again.</p>"

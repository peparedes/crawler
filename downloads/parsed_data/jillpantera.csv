"event","So, just to tell you, I am not dead. But since many/ all who read this have myspace, they know for sure that I am still breathing (sadly). So I am down in Cali visiting friends and so far this trip has only had 3 good days, 4 shitty days, and only 2 left to go. Yeah, the shitty ones will win sadly. Leslie forgot to get days off from work so every time she has to work, I am stuck and none of my other friends are ever free. I was supposed to hang out with Jeff tonight after he got off from work but his gf showed up so of course I am non existent. Yeah, for being one of my best friends, you think he would tell her that he already made plans to hang out with me when she called him... shows how important I am. Leslie has been trying to make up for the lack of time she can spend with me but everyone is busy whenever I will be alone. This just fucking sucks. It is really making me question who my friends are and if I wanna move back here. For all the homesickness I have felt, it isn't what it's cracked up to be. I guess it will be another year and a half before I am here again, I wonder if anyone will even care at that point..."

Life's kinda crazy since I have been working, going to school and figuring out crafty ways to see my boyfriend. Life's been just weird. Coming home smelling like coffee every weekend is just odd but I never get any complaints. I have been hanging out with my only two good friends in WA, Dustin and Monte. They are cool except when Dustin still tries to get with me. I give him points for persistence but other than that it's just annoying. I've gone to a few shows but nothing to exciting, currently I am just kinda bored with life. I have school again in another week, damn year round school, and I am not looking forward to it. One of these days I'll find some serious entertainment around here to keep my boredom down but until then I am just talking to all of my friends and trying to stay grounded. Blah blah blah... nothing to say now... *enter random comment from Matt*"

"event","So, I have been driving a lot from Seattle to Anacortes at random times of the day and night to avoid traffic and no matter how clear it is, there are still people who annoy the shit out of me. 

- Those people who actually go a max of 5 mph over the speed limit in the fast lane need to be shot. I cannot stand them. It's the inner most lane, it's supposed to be the fastest lane and yet they wont go over 65! WHAT THE FUCK!

- The bastards in the huge pick up trucks that can't stay in their own lanes. It's like impossible for them to to stay in the lines, they are always going over them or riding on them at all times. 

- The people who change lanes infront of you that are going 10mph slower than you. Whatever happened to looking before you change lanes? I didn't have to take the driving test when I moved here but I am pretty sure that it's still required to check your mirrors and blind spots before getting over.

- The people who wait forever at stop signs. Come on, you just stop, look for other cars then go. What's so fucking hard about that? I am sick of people sitting there for a couple of minutes like they are just waiting for another car to come. 

- The people who will ride their breaks downhill so they don't go a single mile per hour above the speed limit. When it's fucking 2am and there's no one out, you can go 35 in a 30, no one cares! 

 - Slow mother fucking speed limits. What the fuck? I can understand going 35 in a major city cuz people are jumping out all the time, but in a smaller city that has a two lane in each direction main street, does the speed limit really need to be 25? Come on people, get the stick out of your ass.

- People going under the speed limit when it is actually a good speed. Between Everett and Mount Vernon when you are cruising on the I-5, it's a 70 speed limit, yet I always see people going 60 still. COME ON! As sad as this sounds, but the few times I actually go the speed limit, I am still passing everyone out there.

Man I miss SoCal speeding, that's always fun."

I have been sleeping constantly or feeling like shit. Yesterday my parents tried to make me eat mashed potatoes but I started crying too much so I gave up. My entire body has been aching for days now and I haven't been able to really speak for a couple of days. This morning I wasn't able to even keep water down. So far I have puked 7 times today but right now my stomach is allowing water and even some gatorade so I happy. Puking sucks. This is one of those times when I am really happy that my parents are retired cuz they can take care of me. Both of them went to the doctor's with me, I almost puked when she took the culture from my tonsils then I have to go get blood drawn for the mono test and that made me almost pass out because I was so dehydrated. We ended up getting a wheelchair to get me out to the car then I puked again once we got home... yes... this is so fun. I love digestive pyrotechnics. My poor sick ass... maybe by 10 I'll be able to eat some oatmeal or something. Oh yes, these are the days of our lives..."

My leg keeps shaking cuz I have had so much damn coffee. Man oh man do I need some serious sleep.  Tonight I am sitting in on another recording session with Aaron. I gave him a new title ""the married so don't touch boyfriend with no benefits"" or the boyfriend with no benefits for short. He's cool, he is getting me a ton of connections so I love him for it.

I am sitting around in class waiting around for my damn computer teacher to get here so I can ignore him more. I feel bad for it cuz he is a nice guy and all, but the class is so boring it hurts. I can't help it. Wait, he just got here. He's a pretty cool guy and he lets us out early so I have to love him for that. 

Oh man, so hungry.... My stomach is howling at me. Doom de doom de doom. So yeah, audio kids are a lot cooler than graphic design kids. These people actually go out of their way to talk to you, it's pretty damn cool if I do say so myself. they come to me... I just sit there and talk back. Okay, well, back to the education process.

So I am changing my major from Graphic Design to Audio Production, so I am getting to start all over again. Dude, I can't make my fucking mind up. I have been chronicling my drama of figuring out my life in poetry, maybe I'll see if I can get my ass published and be able to give up on all of this shit and write for a living like I really wanna do. There is bound to be someone out there who knows how I feel about all of this. There is just too much pressure to make up your mind about who you will be.

I have lost so many people I love this month, so many that I don't even list them on calendars, in my journals, or even speak their names anymore. In these past few years I have learned so much about life as many of my friends have lost their own. I could say it's not fair, it's not right, but it's life. We all die, some just sooner than others. Cruel as it is, our mortality is our greatest weakness. Everything we do is a risk, simply breathing can kill you, yet we do it all. We go on with our lives and ignore it all. I never really had that luxury of of not knowing death. To this day my dad pities me for the loss I have experienced during my short existence. Shit happens. To all those I did not name, you aren't forgotten, you never will be."

Dylan got mad at me for being gone for so long due to class and peed on a project of mine that I had just finished painting... oh yes, good times, I loved scrubing that out of my carpet.

I've been doing that whole job search thing, so far Tully's looks like it is a possiblity. I don't know though, me is tan pants and a white shirt... it could give someone a heart attack, I think I might be able to blend into my parent's walls at their house. This whole concept of a job sucks nuts, my life is already busy from school alone without sticking in a job.

On the homefront, my parents just got a new car... not too exciting but whatever. I guess the horse (aka our lab Bodie) has been hanging out with all the other dogs on the street, working on the pack mentality for them. The parents are coming down on thursday for some home show thing so my dad will hook up my surround sound that he brought last saturday when they came down. Hopefully we will get to the Frye to check out the Mark Ryden show before it's gone next week. www.wondertoonel.com if you wanna check out his work. I love him!

Ken and I hung out on Broadway today to grab some food, met some punk kids, it was great. One guy had a psychobilly hawk and this scarf that made him look like he was a Irish soccer hoolagin. Goodtimes.

Ken and I are pulling this whole overly dramatic on and off thing, it's driving me crazy. Grrrr to the drama. Stupid boys.

Well, off to bed, I have to wake up for class and to work on my scavenging for info for my Humanities midterm tomorrow.... fun fun."

He seems to hate everything I love except the music. He drives me insane. As my mom said ""maybe he is just too redneck for you."" I think that sums it up completely. Give me a week and I will once again be single. I highly doubt it but if he is reading this, I am sorry."

We moved in some stuff for the kitchen and everything and tried to figure out the lay out of my place, after fighting with my mom for 10 minutes she finally allowed me to decide where my bed would be put. Dude, as much of a help as she is, as soon as she is gone I have to move everything around so it will be where I want it, not where she wants it. The major move in is thursday, not looking forward to it. I was so stressed from everything I almost started to cry. This is turning me into a damned emo kid, esh. I think I am just going to fall over dead on thursday. Ken and I are gonna be staying at my apartment for New Years so we can hang out on the roof of my building and watch the fireworks over the space needle, should be fun. Then I have to come back home for a doctor's appointment and to pick up the midget dog then take him there, I hope he doesn't have a heart attack."

"event","So I have survived my first day here, jumped from Riverside to SD this morning so Leslie could work. I hung out with Jeff and Jay all day and I must admit, it was pretty damn fun even though we did little to nothing. Jeff and I embarrassed the crap out of Jay whenever we went anywhere by making ""lude"" jokes in public. Ah, good times.

Then Jay went to work and Leslie got off work (they both work and In'n'Out but rarely the same shift) and so we hung out with Leslie. She was sad to hear that she missed all of the good jokes. Putting Jeff and I together generally causes people to be disturbed because neither of us have any shame around eachother so we talk about everything. Man oh man, I'll never forget the Kragen expeirence, all I have to say is that after about 2 minutes of conversation, we had everyone in there giving us the ""oh my god"" look and Jay trying to rush out as fast as possible.

"event","The following is supposedly an actual question given on a University 
of Washington chemistry mid-term. The answer by one student was so 
""profound"" that the professor shared it with colleagues via the 
Internet, which is why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it. 

Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or 
endothermic (absorbs heat)? 

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law 
(gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some 
variant. 

One student, however, wrote the following: 

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So 
we Need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the 
rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume 
that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no 
souls are leaving. 

As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different 
Religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions 
state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to 
Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since 
people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that 
all souls go to Hell. 

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of 
souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of 
change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in 
order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the 
volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. 

This gives two possibilities: 

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which 
souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will 
increase until all Hell breaks loose. 

2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls 
in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell 
freezes over. So which is it? 

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman 
Year that, ""it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you, 
and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, 
then number 2 must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is 
exothermic and has already frozen over. 

The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it 
follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, 
extinct...leaving only Heaven thereby proving the existence of a 
divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting 
""Oh my God."""

I think my fear of commitment is kicking in again and making me wanna run. There has only been one person in my life to ever make me look beyond the fears and actually think I could ever have a future with him and I never even got that guy. Ken is great, he is everything I have ever wanted in a guy and more and he loves me for who I am. He doesn't judge, hell, he even thinks I look cute when I have horrible just rolled out of bed hair. He is such a wonderful person yet I am sitting here wondering about it all. I don't know why I do this, I love him but I question the love. He makes me so happy yet when I kiss him I don't feel that tingle down my spine, I don't feel the rush. I just don't get it. Maybe it's just the fear of thinking this is it, this could be the guy I am with forever or maybe it's something else. I don't get it. Love normally makes me smile constantly and want to be around the guy all the time and just be so happy yet with him, it does and it doesn't. I doubt that I am making any sense but if you guys have any help or advice or anything throw it out for me cuz I am royally confused."

It was hilarious, we were in one of the stores and we were like bickering over some shirt for him and he brought up hating OC so I smacked him on the arm and was all like "" don;t make me kick your ass!"" And this girl walking by was all like ""Hell yeah! You go girl!"" It was by far the funniest and weirdest thing to happen to me in a long time.

Oh, on the midget front, Dylan is slowly starting to like Ken considering we keep having him give Dylan treats, by the time this is over he will no longer be a midget, instead he will be my rollie-pollie. Poor little chubby puppy. And just to make things even more odd, Ken has a cat that absolutely hates anyone she doesn't know... Me and my midget, him and his cat. Simply ironic in a really weirdo way.

Okay, so I have a boyfriend named Ken, he kicks ass, we hang out a lot and we're dorky together. We talk about everything, listen to music, and watch movies all the time. We have a good time and I must admit he is probably the best bf I have had so far (sad I know). He makes me really happy and my parents even like him. Unfortunately the midget still fears him. But my mom thinks he's a keeper... it's a first!

I am doing pretty well in school. I just got a 94% on my second psych midterm, add that to the 86% I got on the last one and I have an A- in the class. Not bad for random guessing and overall confusion. The parents are proud of me. I think I am cursed in my ceramics class though cuz one way or another my projects keep getting hurt. It sucks but I make it work. My english class is annoying, the teacher is a nimrod and I think he is scared of me cuz I speak out against what he thinks of the poems. Eh, as long as I get an A I don't give a damn. I have my schedule for next quarter figured out, journalism, radio broadcasting, yoga, art, and this first aid/CPR class. Should be pretty simple and I would have friday off and only yoga on monday. Ahhhhh... good shite.

Tomorrow I have my meeting at the Art Institute of Seattle. Hopefully it all works out. I am dying to move to Seattle and get the fuck off this island. Graphic design is right up my secondary alley... it's all about the writing but I have to put that to the side for reality's sake. Wish me luck!

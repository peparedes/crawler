"event","Kerry's Concession  Speach

My  fellow Americans, the people of this nation have spoken, and spoken with a  clear voice. So I am here to offer my concession.

I concede that I  overestimated the intelligence of the American people. Though the people  disagree with the President on almost every issue, you saw fit to vote for  him. I never saw that coming. That's really special.

And I mean ""special""  in the sense that we use it to describe those kids who ride the short school  bus and find ways to injure themselves while eating pudding with rubber  spoons. That kind of special.
<lj-cut text=""I cut because I care."">

I concede that I misjudged the power of  hate. That's pretty powerful stuff, and I didn't see it. So let me take a  moment to congratulate the President's strategists: Putting the gay marriage  amendments on the ballot in various swing states like Ohio... well, that was  just genius. Genius. It got people, a certain kind of people, to the polls.  The unprecedented number of folks who showed up and cited ""moral values"" as  their biggest issue, those people changed history. The folks who consider same  sex marriage a more important issue than war, or terrorism, or the  economy...

Who'd have thought the election would belong to them? 

Well,  Karl Rove did. Gotta give it up to him for that. Now, now. Credit where it's  due.

I concede that I put too much faith in America's  youth. With 8 out of 10 of you  opposing the President, with your friends and classmates dying daily in a  war you disapprove of, with your future being mortgaged to pay for rich  old peoples' tax breaks, you somehow managed to sit on your asses and watch the Cartoon Network while aging homophobic hillbillies carried the day.

You voted with the exact same anemic percentage that you did in 2000.  You suck. Seriously, y'do. Thank you. Thank you very much.

There  are some who would say that I sound bitter, that now is the time for  healing, to bring the nation together. Let me tell you a little story.

Last night, I watched the returns come in with some friends here in Los Angeles. As the night progressed, people began to talk half-seriously about secession, a red state / blue state split. The reasoning was  this:

We in blue states produce the vast majority of the wealth in  this country and pay the most taxes, and you in the red states receive the majority of the money from those taxes while complaining about 'em. We in the blue states are the only ones who've been attacked by foreign  terrorists, yet
you in the red states are gung ho to fight a war in our  name. We in the blue states produce the entertainment that you consume so  greedily each day, while you in the red states show open disdain for us and  our values. Blue state civilians are the actual victims and targets of the  war on terror, while red state civilians are the ones standing behind us  and yelling ""Oh, yeah!? Bring it on!""

More than 40% of you Bush  voters still believe that Saddam Hussein had something to do with 9/11. I'm  impressed by that, truly I am. Your sons and daughters who might die in  this war know it's not true, the people in the urban centers where al Qaeda  wants to attack know it's not true, but those of you who are at practically  no risk believe this easy lie because you can. As part of my concession  speech, let me say that I really envy that luxury.I concede  that.

Healing? We, the people at risk from terrorists, the people who  subsidize you, the people who speak in glowing and respectful terms about the heartland of America while that heartland insults and excoriates us... we  wanted some healing. We spoke loud and clear. And you refused to give it  to us, largely because of your high moral values. You knew better:  Americadoesn't need its allies, doesn't need to share the burden, doesn't need  to unite the world, doesn't need to provide for its future. Hell no. Not  when it's got a human shield of pointy-headed, atheistic,  non-confrontational breadwinners who are willing to pay the bills and play  nice in the vain hope of winning a vote that we can never have. Because  we're ""morally nferior,"" I suppose, we are supposed to respect your values  while you insult ours. And the big joke here is that for 20 years, we've  done just that. It's not a ""ha-ha"" funny joke, I realize, but it's a joke  all the same.

As well as conceding the election today, I am also  announcing my candidacy for President in 2008. And I make this pledge to  you today: THIS time, next time, there will be no pandering. This time I  will run with all the open and joking contempt for my opponents that our  President demonstrated towards the cradle of liberty, the Ivy League  intellectuals, the ""media elite,"" and the""white-wine sippers."" This time I  will not pretend that the simple folk of America know just as much as the  people who devote their lives to serving and studying the nation and the  world. They don't.

So that's why I'm asking for your vote in 2008,  America. I'm talking to you, you ignorant, slack-jawed yokels, you  bible-thumping, inbred drones, you redneck, racist, chest-thumping,  perennially duped grade-school grads. Vote for me, because I know better,  and I truly believe that I can help your smug, sorry asses. Thank you, and  may God, if he does in fact exist, bless each and every one of  you."

GOP dirty tricks in Ohio?
Voter registration is exploding in the swing state, but a ruling by the obstructionist Republican secretary of state may result in thousands not voting.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Lisa Chamberlain



Oct. 9, 2004  |  On Monday, the final day of voter registration in Ohio, the Board of Elections in Cleveland had a line out the door. ""I've never seen anything like this in my life,"" said John Ryan, head of the Cleveland AFL-CIO. ""We did a voter registration drive four years ago. We turned in 14,399 new registration forms, and we were pleased with that. This time, there are about 100,000 newly registered voters. That blows my mind. This is not Arizona with a growing population. People are leaving this area, not coming in."" 

That people are moving to other states is due in no small part to the fact that Cleveland is now the poorest big city in the country, with a poverty rate of 31.3 percent, according to a recent Census report. The rest of Ohio isn't faring much better, with poverty rates in Cincinnati at 21.1 percent, Toledo at 20.3 percent and Columbus at 16.5 percent. For those who can't leave, voting seems to have taken on an urgency not seen in many years, if not decades. 

With the registration deadline past, the focus for the numerous groups in Ohio that are working to mobilize voters has now shifted to making sure those voters get to the polls and, once they get there, are able to vote. Conventional wisdom has always held that the hard part is getting people signed up and to the polls. But with millions of dollars being spent by groups such as America Coming Together, MoveOn PAC, 21st Century Democrats and others on such efforts, a more important problem may be getting those votes counted -- a fear given definite shape thanks in no small part to Ohio's obstructionist Republican secretary of state, Kenneth Blackwell. 

While there had been a lot of hand-wringing among elected officials, voting rights groups and the public over electronic voting, Ohio passed a law in May requiring that all new machines have a paper receipt by 2006. This, of course, won't occur until after the 2004 presidential election, but the change has had a deterrent effect on a switch to electronic voting machines. According to Petee Talley, who is chairing the Ohio Voter Protection Coalition, made up of labor, civil rights, voting rights, retiree and community organizations: ""Ninety-five percent of Ohio's voters will be voting on the same equipment they did the last time."" <lj-cut text=""CLick here to read the rest of the article."">

So, befitting the state's anachronistic Rust Belt economy, tactics have turned to good old-fashioned voter suppression and intimidation rather than high-tech tampering. In a recent campaign stop in Cleveland, Sen. John Kerry suggested that such intimidation was already underway. His comments came on the heels of Blackwell's backpedaling on his decision to enforce an archaic law requiring that all new registrations be on postcard-weight paper. But it seems Blackwell may have several more tricks up his sleeve. 

""What's happening in Ohio,"" says Talley, ""is that the secretary of state has issued a statement saying that provisional ballots should not be issued if voters are in the wrong polling location."" With tens of thousands of newly registered voters, confusion about where to go is likely. Withholding provisional ballots -- which the Help America Vote Act, passed in 2002 in the wake of the 2000 election debacle, specifically mentions as an alternative voting method when valid registration is in doubt -- will result in many people simply not voting. 

We ""sent a letter to the secretary of state saying that it's a violation of the Help America Vote Act,"" says Talley. Not getting an adequate response, the Ohio Voter Protection Coalition filed a lawsuit on Tuesday. The Ohio Democratic Party has already sued on this issue, and a judge is expected to issue a ruling on that suit by Oct. 15. 

Provisional ballots might seem like small potatoes in the scheme of things. But one professor at Case Western Reserve University -- site of the recent vice presidential debate in Cleveland -- has crunched some numbers and he's not at all convinced this issue is of little consequence. 

Using data from the 2000 election, the professor, Norman Robbins, calculates conservatively that as many as 13,000 Clevelanders will have to use a provisional ballot as a result of clerical and other errors. The typical discard rate for provisional ballots means that nearly 2,300 of those will be invalidated. But this doesn't include all the people who show up at the wrong polling place and don't get a provisional ballot at all. Multiply this by the eight urban areas around Ohio and the potential for disenfranchisement is high. Considering that Al Gore lost Ohio by 165,000 votes and Ralph Nader (who will not be on the ballot) took 117,857 votes, it could impact the election not just in Ohio, but affect the outcome of the national race. 

""Who does this provisional ruling affect most?"" asks Robbins. ""People who move. Census data shows that low-income people are 90 percent more likely to move. If you're poor, you're twice as likely to have to vote provisionally. On top of that, when they get a provisional ballot, they're likely to encounter [poll workers] who give them unclear information on a complex form. That's already difficult. 

""Now, if you're in the wrong precinct, don't bother voting because your provisional ballot is going to be thrown out, even if it was a clerical error that got you into provisional world. These are the people who are most likely going to have two jobs. They're not going to be able to go to another poll. They might have kids in day care. They may have no car. This ruling disproportionately targets one part of the Ohio population."" And they are, needless to say, most likely Democratic voters. 

Ohio's secretary of state was also sued because 21 counties were wrongly informing ex-felons that they had no right to vote. According to Robbins, the secretary of state's office agreed to inform all ex-felons of their voting rights in time for the registration deadline, but then backed out based on a ""distorted"" interpretation of the law. 

And then there is the specter of hanging chads if the race in Ohio is close enough to trigger a recount. Sixty-eight counties in Ohio (out of 88) will vote using punch card ballots. (In fact, it was little noted at the time, but Cleveland also had its very own butterfly ballot in 2000, and it was as poorly designed as Theresa LePore's in Palm Beach County, Fla.). Again using the 2000 election as a guidepost, Robbins says punch card ballots have nearly a 4 percent error rate. With some 300,000 voters in Cleveland, that's nearly 8,000 lost votes, factoring in the turnout rate. He is critical of Blackwell for doing very little to educate voters about how to use punch card machines, and points to Los Angeles as having undertaken a model educational campaign that greatly reduced the error rate. 

""In 2002, the Federal Election Commission said that these error rates were unacceptable,"" says Robbins. Blackwell ""knew the majority of counties would be using punch cards, and he'd done nothing to improve that situation until a week ago. What they're doing now is good, but it's very late in the day and he had to be badgered into it."" 

Blackwell has defended himself and his office by saying that these criticisms did not surface until recently. But Robbins says the voter coalition he's been working with sent letters to Blackwell on July 29 and again on Sept. 2, pointing out the problems and making suggestions. 

Finally, of course, there is the specter of voter intimidation, something that -- until Florida 2000 -- some people didn't believe ever happened in the United States, even though it occurred not only during the civil rights movement but has been going on covertly since Reconstruction after the Civil War. 

""As someone who's worked in Democratic politics in Ohio, I've seen these tactics done for years,"" says Mike Casey, who runs Tigercomm, a media consulting firm in Cleveland, and is working with a newly established group called Citizens Against Un-American Voter Intimidation. ""Every election cycle, you hear after the fact about the white sheriffs who sat there for five hour with guns holstered who are there to intimidate. They're there to shave 1 percent off. With all this voter registration activity going on, some people don't want those people to vote."" 

But the Ohio Democratic Party, which has been keeping the heat on Blackwell, doesn't think voter intimidation is going to be much of a problem this year. ""There have been claims of that in Cincinnati and other places,"" says Dan Trevas, a spokesperson for the Ohio Democratic Party. ""But this is going to be such a heavily attended and watched election, the ability to intimidate voters is going to be very difficult, especially in places that really matter, like large cities."" 

Given a recent alarming report by the NAACP and People for the American Way, the Ohio Democratic Party's cavalier attitude may be misplaced. Citing intimidation tactics outlined in the report, such as sending security teams to minority polling places, wrongly demanding I.D.'s and taking photos of voters, the New York Times concluded, ""The suppression of minority votes is alive and well in 2004, driven by the sharp partisan divide across the nation. Because many minority groups vote heavily Democratic, some Republicans view keeping them from registering and voting as a tactic for victory -- one that has a long history in American politics."" 

""Basic democratic rights are being tampered with by political thugs,"" says Casey. ""Think about that. It's the most un-American thing you can possibly do, besides spy for al-Qaida. So we're trying to pay heightened, advanced attention to things that rarely surface until Election Day. It's after everything is decided [that] some evidence comes to light, and there's some reporting by an exhausted press corps, but it's already over. If you don't call attention to it beforehand, to hold people accountable, then this activity pays."""

"event","New rule: Everyone has to stop pretending that George Bush is so mach

Because, plainly, he acts like a girl.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Bill Maher

Oct. 8, 2004 | Not a woman -- a girl. Not a week goes by when John Kerry isn't attacked because he said something that hurt someone's feelings. According to Bush spokesmen, Kerry lost the first debate because of his ""new insult"" to our allies when he said the coalition wasn't genuine. Poland had Lithuania over for a debate party that night, and now they can't look at each other without crying.

All of the attacks on Kerry involve his thoughtless words at the expense of someone's feelings: He hurt the Iraqi prime minister when he said he wasn't legitimate -- the bitch; he hurt the troops in Iraq when he said it was the wrong war at the wrong time -- men!; he hurt the Vietnam vets when he totally broke the girl code and told everybody about their atrocities. And worst of all, he hurt the president's feelings when he laughed at Whoopi Goldberg's jokes.

And another thing about John Kerry: He uses Botox, he spends too much time on his hair, and he's two-faced -- flip-flopper!

""Also, I bet John Kerry didn't deserve any of those medals. I woulda gone to stupid old Vietnam, but I wanted to be a stay-at-home soldier.""

Excuse me, this president isn't resolute: He's on the rag.

He stopped having press conferences, which is basically saying, ""I'm not talking to you."" He couldn't testify before the 9/11 commission without having a man by his side. I'll bet when they have lunch, Cheney orders for him. And then he just eats the salad.

They say Kerry is too sensitive, but they're the ones who turn everything into a big baby mama drama. Bush is the one who looked all crampy and pouty last week: ""It's hard work"" -- I kept waiting for him to say, ""If you don't like how I do your shirts, then iron them yourself.""

He even ran for president like a girl in 2000. Promising to ""restore dignity to the Oval Office."" What man gives a rat's ass about restoring an office? A real man thinks the Oval Office lost all its integrity the day Monica Lewinsky stopped coming in there to blow the president.

And then, in the one area -- I'm talking about Iraq -- where he could use being a little in touch with his feminine side, he acts like the typical stupid male, who gets himself lost, won't admit it, and won't stop and ask for directions. No matter that we've already taken 10 wrong turns and are heading for what seems like it could be a cliff -- no, he's not stopping, not listening to anybody, not reading the instructions, just insisting, ""Please, I know what I'm doing."""

ZELLFIRE AND BRIMSTONE
9/02/2004

Night three of the Republican National Convention was the night he arose, assuming the ""he"" in that sentence is the featured speaker of the evening, Vice President Dick Cheney. The theme: ""Land of Opportunity,"" which just barely beat out ""Land of Chocolate."" Needless to say, it would have been a very different evening.

Before him, the controversial but not flamboyant senator Rick Santorum, in keeping with the night's theme, told a story about how his immigrant family bettered itself by coming to America, saying, ""My father came to the coal fields outside Johnston, Pennsylvania, when he was seven, from a small village in Italy..."" at which point he crumpled up and tossed away his script, adding, ""Aw, to heck with it, let's get on to banning gay marriage.""

Then came Michael Reagan, adopted son of Ronald Reagan, who tried to remain above the fray, saying, ""My mother, father, and birth-mother were pro-life and pro-adoption. Because they were, my father made me a Reagan. I come to honor my father, not politicize his name."" He was then informed that by saying that, he just blew it.

Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney was also on hand, bringing along words for his state's junior senator, stating, ""I don't want presidential leadership that comes in 57 varieties."" That is of course a Heinz reference, as opposed to the Bush presidency that only comes in one flavor: Ranch.

Then came that defining moment of the convention, the ""keynote address,"" the speech that most embodies the guiding spirit of the party, which Republicans have been saying is ""compassion, optimism, and opportunity."" It was delivered, surprisingly, by the Democratic senator Zell Miller. And even more surprisingly, he made people compassion in their shorts as he said, ""John Kerry has been more wrong, more weak and more wobbly than any other national figure,"" ""Kerry would let Paris decide when America needs defending,"" and ""Don't waste your breath telling that to the leaders of my party today. In their warped way of thinking, America is the problem, not the solution."" The senator was later asked nicely if he could please use his ""National TV"" voice.

To be fair, as he went on, Miller made it clear he didn't ""hate"" Kerry, so much as what Kerry represents: opposition. He raged, ""Our nation is being torn apart and made weaker because of the Democrats' manic obsession to bring down our commander-in-chief."" It was that same obsession that drove our founding fathers to compulsively schedule an election every four years. They also washed their hands a lot.

Finally, Vice President Dick Cheney took the stage and, always an ace at reading an audience, opened with some humor, saying, ""People tell me that Senator Edwards got picked for his good looks, his sex appeal, and his great hair. I say to them, 'How do you think I got the job?'"" He then checked his resume and remembered he was Ford's chief-of-staff, served under Reagan and the first President Bush, then George W. made him head of his V.P. search committee, where Cheney picked himself.

Cheney continued, ""In this time of challenge, America needs and America has a president we can count on to get it right."" He added, ""I mean, not W.M.D.'s and Al Qaeda connections right, but... pretty much. Second term's the charm, anyway."""

BUSH LEAGUE
9/03/2004

On the final night of the Republican National Convention, or NAMBLA as it was known to New Yorkers, President George W. Bush himself took Madison Square Garden's stage, opening with, ""I am honored by your support and I accept your nomination for president of the United States."" And with that, the president refused to quit while he's ahead.

Bush began by thanking all the evil people who made this possible, saying, ""I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days and I am honored to have him at my side."" To which Cheney added, ""I promised myself I wouldn't cry. You had me at no-bid contract.""

The speech proceeded as a reprisal of ideas you may have heard in Bush's stump speeches and State of the Union addresses... you know, because once you start doing the big arena shows, people are going to want to hear the hits! Bush read such favorites as, ""We must strengthen social security,"" ""The union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society,"" and ""Challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations."" Attendees then began to chant, ""Whooo! Do faith-based initiatives! Do faith-based initiatives!""

In another blast from the past, the president used health care as a way to remind his base that he's a Washington outsider, saying, ""We will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C."" He's right. Those do-nothing bums who've been running Washington for the last few years have got to go.

While the president dusted off the whole ""compassionate conservative"" thing for this election, he didn't bother with any of the ""uniter not divider"" crap, instead just keeping the ""divide"" part as he said, ""I support protection of marriage against activist judges,"" and ""We must make a place for the unborn child."" After all, we have all been coasting on that uterus thing since the dawn of time. It's a little played out.

Fortunately, if all of these policy details were too much to wrap your head around, the president had a place for you to go, ""Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online. The web address is not very imaginative. But it's easy to remember: 'George W. Bush.com'"" he continued, ""slash policies slash anal zoo. That's one word. Gotta remind myself to fire that I.T. guy."""

"event","From Bush's speech last night.... 

""I am running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives.""

""Because a caring society will value its weakest members, we must make a place for the unborn child.""

""Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges.""

BTW, my favorite part of the speech was when Bush took a moment to talk about being compassionate towards Islam, and then the camera cut away to Barbara Bush poking her finger on her daughter's forehead (where a hindu woman would have her bindi), and her daughter rolling her eyes. Way to understand the world's religions and show tolerance at the same time. NIIIIIIICE!

One more aside, the whole thing, podium in the middle of the arena, etc. was so very Triumph of the Will, it was disturbing."

Inventing The ""Clinton Recession""
The CEA is trying to alter the start date in a way that benefits Bush. `Tain't fair

No one should be surprised when economic or budget forecasts coming out of Washington are influenced by politics, especially during an election year. But when economic history is rewritten -- with political consequences -- that's going too far. President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, chaired by Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw, is trying to get away with exactly such revisionist history. The CEA's Economic Report of the President, released Feb. 9, unilaterally changed the start date of the last recession to benefit Bush's reelection bid. Instead of using the accepted start date of March, 2001, the CEA announced that the recession really started in the fourth quarter of 2000 -- a shift that would make it much more credible for the Bush Administration to term it the ""Clinton Recession."" In a subsequent press conference, Mankiw said that the CEA had looked at the available data and ""made the call.""
<lj-cut text=""Proving once again they have no shame and no souls"">

This simple statement masks an attack on one of the few remaining bastions of economic neutrality. For almost 75 years, the start and end dates of recessions have been set by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a private nonpartisan research group based in Cambridge, Mass.

While there have been complaints over the years, this arrangement has been accepted by economists, government agencies, and politicians -- until now. ""For the first time, the federal government is intervening in the process,"" says Robert Hall, an economist at Stanford University and the conservative Hoover Institution who since 1978 has chaired the NBER panel of seven prominent economists who make the actual decision. The NBER's decisions have been dragged into the political arena before, but without impact. In the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration tried, unsuccessfully, to convince the NBER to combine the 1980 and 1981-82 recessions into a single downturn that could be called the ""Carter Recession."" During the '92 election season, the first Bush Administration kept hoping that the NBER would announce that the recession of 1990-91 was over -- a statement that didn't come until December, 1992.

To be fair, even if the latest recession did begin after Bush took office in January, 2001, no one can say he caused it. And Mankiw is also under attack from Republicans for what they consider his overly tin ear on other subjects, most notably his statement that the outsourcing phenomenon is ""a plus for the economy in the long run.""

Still, his decision to fiddle with economic convention can't be seen as anything less than manipulation in an election year. In his press conference, Mankiw justified his decision by saying, correctly, that the NBER panel was already considering moving the recession start date forward. Some key data that the NBER watch -- including industrial production and inflation-adjusted business sales -- peaked in mid-2000. On the other hand, the latest revisions from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shifted the peak of nonfarm employment slightly later, from February to March, 2001. That's important, because the recessions of 1981-82 and 1990-91 both started in or after the month that employment fell.

But rather than waiting for the NBER's decision, Bush's CEA jumped the gun. And it made the biggest change possible, despite considerable debate within the NBER panel. The revised date is ""very much up in the air,"" says Hall. Adds Jeffrey Frankel, a member of the NBER panel, an economist at Harvard University, and a former member of Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers: ""The way I read the data, there isn't a strong case for moving the date up by more than one month."" That puts the start date at February, 2001, after Bush took office. The lack of a clear picture has led the NBER to hold off making a final decision pending more accurate data. There's ""no sense of time pressure,"" says Hall. ""We want to do this right.""

Economists who go to Washington always struggle to maintain their objectivity against the political demands of the administration they work for. Based on its latest performance, the CEA seems to have lost the battle."

More Americans in poverty, uninsured
According to the Census Bureau, the national poverty rate rose last year, as well as the number of uninsured Americans. The hardest hit were women and children.


WASHINGTON - The number of Americans living in poverty or lacking health insurance rose for the third straight year in 2003, the Census Bureau announced Thursday, reflecting a jobs market that failed to match otherwise strong economic growth.

Overall, the median household income was $43,318, while the national poverty rate rose from 12.1 percent in 2002 to 12.5 percent last year. Hardest hit were women, who for the first time since 1999 saw their earnings decline, and children. By the end of 2003, 12.9 million children lived in poverty.

The newest numbers included good news for Miami, which is no longer the nation's poorest major city -- dropping from No. 1 to No. 5 behind Cleveland, Ohio; Newark, N.J.; Detroit, and Fresno, Calif. Meanwhile, the percentage of Florida's population in poverty edged up from 12.1 percent to 12.7 percent.

<lj-cut text=""Read the whole article by clicking here"">

As expected, the number of people without health insurance grew last year, to 45 million -- an increase from 15.2 percent to 15.6 percent. White adults, primarily in the South, accounted for most of the increase. The proportion of people receiving health insurance through an employer fell from 61.3 percent to 60.4 percent, the lowest in a decade.

The census report provided hard numbers to anecdotal evidence that the recovery has neglected certain regions and segments of the population. An additional 1.3 million Americans fell below the poverty line in 2003, as incomes dipped for the poorest 20 percent of the population. An additional 1.4 million became newly uninsured.

FAILED TO REACH ALL

''This recovery has failed to reach those in the bottom half,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute.

As President Bush prepared to head to New York for the Republican National Convention, Thursday's data gave Democrats an opening for picking at his perceived weakness on traditional bread-and-butter issues.

''While George Bush tries to convince America's families that we're turning the corner, slogans and empty rhetoric can't hide the real story,'' said presidential challenger John Kerry. ``Under George Bush's watch, America's families are falling further behind.''

Bush, campaigning in New Mexico, had no comment. Commerce Secretary Don Evans said the census data looked ''backward in time at an economy that was substantially weaker'' than it is today. He predicted that the numbers will improve as Bush ''continues to press extremely hard to create the right conditions and business climate'' for job growth and broader health coverage.

Yet the census report stood in sharp contrast to an economy and stock market that grew briskly in 2003, especially in the second half of the year. ''The impact of a persistent jobless recovery is all over these results,'' said Bernstein.

With fewer people working and fewer small businesses offering health coverage, the uninsured figure will likely remain high until the unemployment rate drops to about 4 percent, said Paul Fronstin, a senior research associate at the Employee Benefit Research Institute.

''It's not just about how many people have jobs, but it's about the kind of jobs they have,'' he said. ``Even though people are employed, they are less likely to have access to coverage.''

POVERTY LINE VARIES

The national poverty rate declined from 1993 to 2000, when it reached 11.3 percent. In the next three years, 4.3 million more people fell below the poverty line, and the median household income dropped by more than $1,500 in inflation-adjusted terms.

The poverty line is not a single, consistent number, but instead varies with time and family size. In 2003, the average poverty line for an individual was $9,393; for a family of four, it was $18,810. Despite the recent increase in poverty rates, the rates remained lower than the average for both the 1980s and the 1990s.

Economic issues -- including the availability and affordability of health insurance -- remain top concerns among voters. In several recent Washington Post and Gallup surveys, voters gave the president no better than a 51 percent approval rating on his handling of the economy; and in a head-to-head matchup with Kerry on economic matters, Bush trailed 41 percent to his challenger's 52 percent.

Children made up a large segment of the impoverished, accounting for more than half of the overall increase as 733,000 more youngsters slipped below the poverty line. Similarly, the number of families in poverty headed by a single mother jumped 1.5 percent, to 3.9 million.

Sheldon H. Danziger, co-director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan, said the rise in poverty represents fallout from the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. Because the new policy shifted government benefits to reward those who work, single mothers who were employed received additional assistance when jobs were plentiful but are struggling now that the economy has 1.2 million fewer jobs."

It was exactly four years ago today as I write these words that candidate George W. Bush appeared before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. At the time, the Bush campaign was pushing ""compassionate conservatism."" In that context, the NAACP speech was one of Bush's most important of the campaign. Very few GOP presidential nominees had ever bothered to grace the organization with their presence, and the appearance set Bush in sharp contrast, for example, to the 1996 Republican standard-bearer, Bob Dole, who declined an invitation by way of saying he suspected the group was ""trying to set me up."" 

It was also one of Bush's best speeches of the campaign because it met the crucial criterion, one the pundits love, of showing a surprising humility. Bush acknowledged that ""the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln,"" and he pledged that ""strong civil rights enforcement will be a cornerstone of my administration."" The words were by no means persuasive to everyone, but the media certainly bought the act, and the appearance helped burnish Bush's image as a new kind of Republican. 

Four years later, Bush is shunning an invitation from the NAACP to speak at this year's conference. He blames recent harsh comments by NAACP officials Kweisi Mfume and Julian Bond. And undoubtedly, they have made some such comments. One could well argue that, as black leaders assess the record of an administration that intervened so aggressively to do away with affirmative action in a Michigan court case, the harsh comments were deserved. But policy differences aren't the real reason Bush isn't showing up this year. He isn't showing up because compassionate conservatism is out. 

<lj-cut text=""Read the whole disturbing thing by clicking here."">The same weekend Bush was snubbing the NAACP, he decided to focus his Saturday radio address on his push to ban gay marriage under the Constitution. Since Bush announced that initiative several weeks ago, the expected hubbub about gay rights as a campaign issue has failed to materialize, and it seems that at most, the issue will be a marginal one this fall. And this occurred in a week, remember, when Bush could have, however half-honestly, used the release of the Senate intelligence report to take to the airwaves to proclaim to the American people that the intelligence community received no political pressure from the White House -- any way you slice it, a far more pressing electoral issue. So why return to gay marriage now? 

Because compassionate conservatism is out, and comprehensive conservatism is in. Only a tiny percentage of the electorate is up for grabs this year; maybe five percent. Political guru Karl Rove understands well that the administration's record makes fighting for that five percent a challenge. So the reelection campaign is clearly and only about shoring up the right-wing vote. 

Hence, the about-face on the NAACP. Hence, the attempts to keep the gay-marriage issue in the news from time to time, just to remind his base that, even if the atheistic left-wing media have written the issue off, he has not. Hence, the overwhelming likelihood that Bush will stand by Dick Cheney despite some calls to the contrary (combined with the shrewd observation by my colleague Harold Meyerson in his Washington Post column two weeks ago that a younger and more ambitious veep candidate would interfere with the Bush family's dynastic plans for Jeb's ascendancy). Hence, the cornerstone piece of Rovian strategy -- the emphasis on getting as many of the four million evangelicals who didn't vote in 2000 out to the polls as possible (through, by the way, a politicization of the pulpit that recently led even one Southern Baptist official to pronounce himself ""appalled"" by the tactics). 

I know I'm hardly the first person to make this observation. But the important thing here is not how many liberal columnists make the observation. The important thing is that the mainstream media take notice and get the trope into the news columns. Compassionate conservatism had no trouble at all getting onto the front pages in 2000, when many a piece of ""news analysis"" remarked, with wide-eyed, childlike wonder, on Bush's centrist posture. We're about halfway through this general election campaign, and I sure don't remember seeing many news analysis pieces about the hard-right tenor of this campaign. Rove understands: Give something a reassuring and euphonious name, and journalists will repeat it forever. This year's strategy, we can be sure, will remain unchristened by Rove, who must be chuckling about how easy it all is. 

Undoubtedly, Bush will make a feint or two toward the old compassion motif at the GOP convention (if he doesn't do even that, the hard-right strategy will be on unusually naked display).

The media's job for the next five months is to describe these things not as Bush and Rove wish them to be portrayed, but as they actually are."

It was exactly four years ago today as I write these words that candidate George W. Bush appeared before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. At the time, the Bush campaign was pushing ""compassionate conservatism."" In that context, the NAACP speech was one of Bush's most important of the campaign. Very few GOP presidential nominees had ever bothered to grace the organization with their presence, and the appearance set Bush in sharp contrast, for example, to the 1996 Republican standard-bearer, Bob Dole, who declined an invitation by way of saying he suspected the group was ""trying to set me up."" 

It was also one of Bush's best speeches of the campaign because it met the crucial criterion, one the pundits love, of showing a surprising humility. Bush acknowledged that ""the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln,"" and he pledged that ""strong civil rights enforcement will be a cornerstone of my administration."" The words were by no means persuasive to everyone, but the media certainly bought the act, and the appearance helped burnish Bush's image as a new kind of Republican. 

Four years later, Bush is shunning an invitation from the NAACP to speak at this year's conference. He blames recent harsh comments by NAACP officials Kweisi Mfume and Julian Bond. And undoubtedly, they have made some such comments. One could well argue that, as black leaders assess the record of an administration that intervened so aggressively to do away with affirmative action in a Michigan court case, the harsh comments were deserved. But policy differences aren't the real reason Bush isn't showing up this year. He isn't showing up because compassionate conservatism is out. 

<lj-cut text=""Read the whole disturbing thing by clicking here."">The same weekend Bush was snubbing the NAACP, he decided to focus his Saturday radio address on his push to ban gay marriage under the Constitution. Since Bush announced that initiative several weeks ago, the expected hubbub about gay rights as a campaign issue has failed to materialize, and it seems that at most, the issue will be a marginal one this fall. And this occurred in a week, remember, when Bush could have, however half-honestly, used the release of the Senate intelligence report to take to the airwaves to proclaim to the American people that the intelligence community received no political pressure from the White House -- any way you slice it, a far more pressing electoral issue. So why return to gay marriage now? 

Because compassionate conservatism is out, and comprehensive conservatism is in. Only a tiny percentage of the electorate is up for grabs this year; maybe five percent. Political guru Karl Rove understands well that the administration's record makes fighting for that five percent a challenge. So the reelection campaign is clearly and only about shoring up the right-wing vote. 

Hence, the about-face on the NAACP. Hence, the attempts to keep the gay-marriage issue in the news from time to time, just to remind his base that, even if the atheistic left-wing media have written the issue off, he has not. Hence, the overwhelming likelihood that Bush will stand by Dick Cheney despite some calls to the contrary (combined with the shrewd observation by my colleague Harold Meyerson in his Washington Post column two weeks ago that a younger and more ambitious veep candidate would interfere with the Bush family's dynastic plans for Jeb's ascendancy). Hence, the cornerstone piece of Rovian strategy -- the emphasis on getting as many of the four million evangelicals who didn't vote in 2000 out to the polls as possible (through, by the way, a politicization of the pulpit that recently led even one Southern Baptist official to pronounce himself ""appalled"" by the tactics).

DeLay's Corporate Fundraising Investigated 
Money Was Directed to Texas GOP to Help State Redistricting Effort 

By R. Jeffrey Smith
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, July 12, 2004; Page A01 


In May 2001, Enron's top lobbyists in Washington advised the company chairman that then-House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) was pressing for a $100,000 contribution to his political action committee, in addition to the $250,000 the company had already pledged to the Republican Party that year.

DeLay requested that the new donation come from ""a combination of corporate and personal money from Enron's executives,"" with the understanding that it would be partly spent on ""the redistricting effort in Texas,"" said the e-mail to Kenneth L. Lay from lobbyists Rick Shapiro and Linda Robertson. 

The e-mail, which surfaced in a subsequent federal probe of Houston-based Enron, is one of at least a dozen documents obtained by The Washington Post that show DeLay and his associates directed money from corporations and Washington lobbyists to Republican campaign coffers in Texas in 2001 and 2002 as part of a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts.

DeLay's fundraising efforts helped produce a stunning political success. Republicans took control of the Texas House for the first time in 130 years, Texas congressional districts were redrawn to send more Republican lawmakers to Washington, and DeLay -- now the House majority leader -- is more likely to retain his powerful post after the November election, according to political experts.

<lj-cut text=""Read the rest by clicking here."">But DeLay and his colleagues also face serious legal challenges: Texas law bars corporate financing of state legislature campaigns, and a Texas criminal prosecutor is in the 20th month of digging through records of the fundraising, looking at possible violations of at least three statutes. A parallel lawsuit, also in the midst of discovery, is seeking $1.5 million in damages from DeLay's aides and one of his political action committees -- Texans for a Republican Majority (TRMPAC) -- on behalf of four defeated Democratic lawmakers.

DeLay has not been named as a target of the investigation. The prosecutor has said he is focused on the activities of political action committees linked to DeLay and the redistricting effort. But officials in the prosecutor's office say anyone involved in raising, collecting or spending the corporate money, who also knew of its intended use in Texas elections, is vulnerable.

Documents unearthed in the probe make clear that DeLay was central to creating and overseeing the fundraising. What the prosecutors are still assessing is who knew about the day-to-day operations of TRMPAC and how its money was used to benefit Texas House candidates.

Several weeks ago, DeLay hired two criminal defense attorneys to represent him in the probe. He previously created a fund for corporate donors to help him pay legal bills related to allegations of improper fundraising, and is now considering extending its reach to include the fees for these attorneys.

DeLay declined to comment for this article. Stuart Roy, his spokesman, said: ""DeLay is doing everything moral, legal and ethical to increase the Republican majority and advance conservative ideas. He raised legal campaign money for effective political activity and that makes his critics enraged. Unfortunately, some Democrats are making an attempt to criminalize politics.""

Cristen D. Feldman, the Texas lawyer who filed the suit, said in response, ""I guess DeLay and his team forgot they were from Texas . . . [where] the prohibition against clandestine corporate cash is 100 years old.""

Many corporate donors were explicitly told in TRMPAC letters that their donations were not ""disclosable"" in public records. But documents from several unrelated investigations offer an exceptional glimpse of how corporate money was able to influence state politics -- and also of DeLay's bold use of his network of corporate supporters to advance his agenda.

By investing as much as $2.5 million in corporate money in the 2002 election, TRMPAC and another group, the Texas Association of Business, were able to help elect 26 new Republican candidates to the Texas House. The new Republican majority then redrew the congressional district boundaries and, as a result, five Democrats are likely to lose in the Nov. 2 election, according to political experts.

This case ""is only one piece of a much larger picture,"" said Ronnie Earle, the Travis County district attorney running the investigation. ""And the larger picture is a blueprint of what is happening in the country, namely a saturation of the political process by large corporate interests with large amounts of money.""

Earle, an elected Democrat who oversees the state's Public Integrity Unit, previously prosecuted four elected Republicans and 12 Democrats for corruption or election law violations. So far, he has issued about 100 subpoenas in this case, most of them secret.

Texas is one of 18 states that bar political contributions from corporations for election purposes. But the law has an exception for expenses incurred by political action committees. At issue in Earle's probe, and the lawsuit, is whether the law permits corporations to finance only routine administrative expenses, such as rent, as an official of the Texas Ethics Commission contends, or whether the law permits corporations to finance virtually any activity besides direct contributions to candidates, as TRMPAC's lawyer contends.

The Texas statutes involved -- barring the acceptance of prohibited contributions, the donation of corporate money for improper purposes and the expenditure of money for unauthorized uses -- have been invoked in only a few previous cases. Violations are punishable by as many as 10 years in prison.

Requests to Enron 


DeLay's effort to build a Republican majority in the state legislature by channeling large campaign donations to Texas from lobbyists and corporations with interests before Congress dates at least from the 2000 election. 

In an e-mail dated July 24 of that year, Enron Executive Vice President Steven J. Kean advised colleagues that DeLay had sent notes to company executives ""about designating portions of their contributions for use in Texas.""

Three days later, Enron sent a check for $50,000 to the Republican National State Elections Committee (RNSEC) in Washington, and three top executives sent checks totaling $25,000. Around the same time, RNSEC transferred $1.2 million to the Texas Republican Party, which in turn donated $1.3 million to 20 legislative candidates that year, according to federal and state records.

Public records do not track the final destination of the Enron contribution. But Republican National Committee spokeswoman Christine Iverson said any corporate money sent to Texas by RNSEC was spent only for allowable purposes.

In 2001, DeLay assisted Enron in its efforts to secure deregulation legislation. Houston business lobbyist Anne Culver also sent executives at Enron and other energy firms an e-mail in March of that year stating that ""Mr. DeLay is interested in what he and the other congressmen may be able to due [sic] legislatively to assist in addressing some of the issues we have"" with new pollution-control rules.

DeLay's daughter, Dani Ferro, played a role in arranging access for corporations that gave money to DeLay's project and earned fees for planning fundraising events. On Oct. 10, 2001, Ferro called Enron's Washington-based lobbyists to remind them of an upcoming fundraising event in Florida. ""As part of platinum sponsorship, we have the opportunity to have a dinner with Congressman DeLay either here or in Houston,"" said an e-mail from lobbyist Carolyn Cooney to colleague Linda Robertson. ""Dani wants to know"" when to schedule it, Cooney added.

Roy, the DeLay spokesman, said there was nothing unusual about DeLay's contacts with Enron, a major local employer that had not yet become notorious for accounting fraud. 

Ferro, who has not been named as a target in the investigation but has turned over documents to the grand jury, declined to be quoted for this article.

For a Republican Majority 


The efforts to collect money from Enron represented a small part of DeLay's overall campaign to build a GOP majority in the Texas House. DeLay conceived of TRMPAC as a way to counter Democratic spending and pour new money from corporations and their executives into the redistricting effort.

TRMPAC's startup expenses in 2001 were covered by $50,000 in corporate money from DeLay's principal political action committee, Americans for a Republican Majority (ARMPAC). A second payment of $25,000 was made in late 2002. TRMPAC then raised $525,000 in corporate money on its own, and spent less than $70,000 on its director's salary; the rest went mostly toward fundraising, receptions, polls, candidate evaluations, voter identification and private investigations of key Democratic candidates, according to files obtained by The Post.

TRMPAC's director was John Colyandro, a veteran of White House political adviser Karl Rove's direct-mail firm; one of its decision-makers was Jim Ellis, who runs DeLay's ARMPAC; and its chief corporate fundraiser was the same person who performed that function for ARMPAC. As it turned out, ARMPAC donated money to 15 of the same Republican candidates in Texas, sending along cover letters printed on TRMPAC stationery, lawyers said. No allegations of wrongdoing have been made about the ARMPAC donations.

DeLay chaired the TRMPAC advisory board, wrote his own cover letter for its fundraising brochure and received copies of memos that described Texas candidates being considered for TRMPAC funding. He also traveled to Texas to appear at fundraisers and meet with donors, flying at least once on a plane provided by a private company reimbursed by TRMPAC.

TRMPAC never incurred much in the way of expenses such as rent, utilities and supplies -- of the sort that the Ethics Commission says corporations are allowed to finance. ""For all functional purposes,"" Colyandro said in his court deposition, it was run from the home office of its treasurer. Colyandro did not remember leasing any office space or paying a utility bill.

Colyandro set up a multi-tiered membership program for corporate donors: $100,000 bought a ""private dinner"" with board members such as DeLay, and $50,000 guaranteed a ""special dinner"" including two other contributors. But even smaller sums brought access: Jack Dillard, a Philip Morris official, sent $10,000 to TRMPAC in July 22, 2002, and in a letter expressed thanks ""for the invitation to meet Congressman DeLay in Austin next week.""

Some corporations were careful to specify that their contributions were solely meant to defray legally permissible administrative expenses. TRMPAC solicitations being investigated did not mention the restrictions. For example, DeLay was the featured ""special guest"" at a fundraising luncheon for TRMPAC at the Houston Petroleum Club, where donors were asked to contribute $15,000 to be considered a co-chair and $25,000 to be listed as an underwriter.

""Corporate checks are acceptable,"" the invitation stated, according to a copy obtained by The Post.

TRMPAC's appeals worked. More than $254,000, out of a total of $600,000, was collected from 14 corporations between the middle of May and early September in 2002. Only two were headquartered in Texas -- a beer distributor and a builder of prisons; the others were mostly firms with regulatory or policy interests in both Washington and Texas.

For example, Westar Energy, which in 2002 sought a federal tax break, gave $25,000 to win ""a seat at the table"" during congressional deliberations about the provision, even though it had no business in Texas, according to an internal company e-mail that surfaced in a criminal probe. Its executives joined DeLay -- and top officials from other TRMPAC contributors -- at a golf resort in Puerto Rico owned by a TRMPAC contributor that year. DeLay supported the tax break Westar wanted.

Two other internal documents point to heavy involvement by DeLay in TRMPAC's activities. State Rep. Dianne White Delisi, a TRMPAC board member, told oilman T. Boone Pickens in a letter before the 2002 election that ""House Majority Whip Tom DeLay agreed to help us and has been an ardent advocate for us by raising money, making phone calls, serving as a special guest at events, and providing assistance with leading strategists,"" according to a copy. Pickens's company subsequently donated $5,000, and Pickens sent a personal check for $50,000.

A TRMPAC fundraiser also told members of its ""finance"" board around the same period that DeLay would participate in a conference call ""to update everyone on TRMPAC's efforts to date and to discuss our strategy."" Roy said DeLay appears to have participated in the call, adding that Delisi's letter accurately summarized DeLay's overall involvement.

RNC Involvement 


Besides spending the corporate money it collected to benefit targeted candidates in 2002 -- through polls, fundraising events, voter identification efforts and investigations of Democratic opponents -- TRMPAC also sent corporate money to the Republican Party in Washington, starting a chain of events under review by prosecutors.

It worked like this: On Sept. 10, TRMPAC's director told its accountant that ""a blank soft-dollar check"" made out to the Republican National State Elections Committee should be sent overnight to Ellis, the ARMPAC director, at his headquarters in Washington, according to a copy of the director's e-mail. ""Soft dollars"" was a reference to corporate money. Ellis inscribed $190,000 on the check.

The national committee, in turn, sent the same total amount in seven checks ranging from $20,000 to $40,000 to Texas House candidates on Oct. 4, 2002, completing a transfer that Earle and others believe may have been intended to hide the corporate origins of the money and circumvent the law.

The RNSEC contributions were highly unusual. In no other instance did RNSEC spend more than $2,000 on a state legislative candidate in September, October or November; virtually all of its money went instead to Republican governors and attorneys general.

Earle is scrutinizing the Oct. 4 contributions and trying to determine who was involved in ""the decision-making process,"" according to a copy of one of his subpoenas.

Iverson, the RNC spokeswoman, said the Oct. 4 donations were drawn from a non-corporate account, altogether different from the corporate-related account into which the TRMPAC check was deposited. The fact that the total incoming and outgoing amounts were identical was simply ""coincidence,"" she said. She declined to make available documents she said would support the claim, citing the pending lawsuit.

Terry Scarborough, a lawyer for TRMPAC, similarly said he considers the transaction legal.

Jonathan D. Pauerstein, a lawyer for Ellis, who signed the TRMPAC check, said he also considers the transaction legal and noted that matching dollar exchanges of this kind between state organizations and federal parties are common among Democrats as well as Republicans. If they constituted improper laundering, ""lots of Democrats and Republicans around the U.S. would have soap on their hands,"" he said.

Help From Friends 


TRMPAC played a central, but not unique, role in DeLay's project, which included other political organizations and was assisted in the end by a key Texas lawmaker.

The nonprofit Texas Association of Business spent $1.9 million in corporate money in 2001 and 2002 to send 4 million letters to voters in many of the same districts where TRMPAC's efforts were concentrated. The group is now a target in the investigation, but its lawyer, Andy Taylor, said it is not subject to the same laws as TRMPAC and did nothing illegal.

The Texas lawmaker who played a critical role in the project was state Rep. Tom Craddick (R), a DeLay ally who was running for House speaker in 2002. On Oct. 21 of that year, TRMPAC sent checks for 14 Republican House candidates to Craddick's office; his office then mailed the checks. The grand jury is now looking into whether this or other actions taken in connection with the speaker's race amounted to using ""money or things of value"" to influence the outcome of the speaker's election, a violation of state law.

Craddick's lawyer, Roy Minton, said that ""there is absolutely nothing illegal"" about any actions Craddick took in connection with the race.

In all, 17 House members who received money from TRMPAC were elected. Craddick was elected speaker in a secret ballot, and in May 2003, as the redistricting plan came to the Texas House floor, he ordered state police to help track down Democratic lawmakers trying to boycott the vote. The effort was closely coordinated with DeLay, whose chief political aide Julie Ann Sullivan telephoned the Federal Aviation Administration to find a plane used by some of the Democrats.

The House approved the redistricting plan on Oct. 12, 2003. TRMPAC never reported the bulk of its corporate spending to the Texas Ethics Commission; it was reported only to the Internal Revenue Service, a discrepancy first noticed by a nonprofit advocacy group called Texans for Public Justice. Scarborough, the TRMPAC lawyer, said he believes reporting of this spending in Texas was not required by law.

But Karen Lundquist, the Ethics Commission's nonpartisan executive director, said all expenditures derived from corporate money -- whether for administrative purposes or not -- should have been reported. She also said the rules governing spending by political action committees are clear: Corporate money cannot be used for politically related expenses, such as fundraising and vote drives."

Cheney Linked To Halliburton Deal
WASHINGTON, June 1, 2004


A Pentagon e-mail indicates that a multimillion-dollar Halliburton contract for Iraqi reconstruction was ""coordinated"" with the office of Vice President Dick Cheney, the company's former chief executive, a newsmagazine reports. 

Time magazine says the March 5, 2003 e-mail from an unknown Army Corps of Engineers official says Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz gave his deputy Douglas Feith the authority to ""execute"" the contract for restoring Iraq's oil industry. 
According to the magazine, the e-mail says Feith approved the contract ""contingent on informing WH (White House) tomorrow."" 

""We anticipate no issues since action has been coordinated w VP's (Vice President's) office."" 

<lj-cut text=""Read all about it by clicking here."">

A Cheney spokesman says the vice president ""has played no role whatsoever in government-contract decisions involving Halliburton"" since 2000, and that any contact over the contract was merely to prepare the vice president for possible controversy over such a lucrative deal going to his former firm. 

Halliburton took in $3.6 billion last year from contracts to serve U.S. troops and rebuild the oil industry in Iraq. Halliburton executives say the company is getting about $1 billion a month for Iraq work this year. 

The firm, which won large Pentagon contracts under the Clinton administration as well as the current one, has been under intense scrutiny for its performance in Iraq. 

In March, the Pentagon said it plans to withhold about $300 million in payments to the company because of possible overcharging for meals served to troops in Iraq and Kuwait. 

Halliburton and its military services subsidiary, KBR, face a criminal investigation into alleged misdeeds in government work in Iraq and Kuwait. In this case, Pentagon auditors accuse KBR of overestimating the number of troops to be served meals, thus reaping millions in overcharges. 

Halliburton has said any mistakes in estimating the number of troops came from having to operate in a war zone where the numbers changed quickly and unpredictably. 

Halliburton's other problems include allegations of a kickback scheme by two former workers in Kuwait that prompted Halliburton to reimburse the Pentagon $6.3 million; faulty cost estimates on the $2.7 billion contract to serve troops in Iraq, including failing to tell the Pentagon that KBR fired two subcontractors; and a separate audit that accused KBR of overcharging by $61 million for gasoline delivered to serve the civilian market in Iraq last year. Halliburton has said the charges were proper. 

Halliburton paid $2 million in 2002 to settle charges it inflated costs on a maintenance contract at now-closed Fort Ord in California. 

Federal authorities also are investigating whether Halliburton broke the law by using a subsidiary to do business in Iran, whether the company overcharged for work done for the Pentagon in the Balkans and whether it was involved in an alleged $180 million bribery scheme in Nigeria. The company admitted in 2003 that it improperly paid $2.4 million to a Nigerian tax official. 

Previous reports indicate Halliburton studied the possibility of privatizing Pentagon contracts when Cheney was defense secretary, then was awarded one of the first private deals. Cheney became CEO after leaving the Pentagon. 

A financial disclosure form obtained by CBSNews.com indicates that Cheney received deferred income from the firm after becoming vice president. </lj-cut>

Does anyone dispute that Cheney is a huge part of the Halliburton problem?"

If he's this partisian and right-winged and he has an election to worry about, what is he going to be like when he doesn't have to worry about re-election?

2006 Cuts In Domestic Spending On Table

By Jonathan Weisman
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, May 27, 2004; Page A01

The White House put government agencies on notice this month that if President Bush is reelected, his budget for 2006 may include spending cuts for virtually all agencies in charge of domestic programs, including education, homeland security and others that the president backed in this campaign year.

<lj-cut text=""Read the whole thing by clicking here"">

Administration officials had dismissed the significance of the proposed cuts when they surfaced in February as part of an internal White House budget office computer printout. At the time, officials said the cuts were based on a formula and did not accurately reflect administration policy. But a May 19 White House budget memorandum obtained by The Washington Post said that agencies should assume the spending levels in that printout when they prepare their fiscal 2006 budgets this summer.

""Assume accounts are funded at the 2006 level specified in the 2005 Budget database,"" the memo informs federal program associate directors and their deputies. ""If you propose to increase funding above that level for any account, it must be offset within your agency by proposing to decrease funding below that level in other accounts.""

J.T. Young, a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget, said the memo, titled ""Planning Guidance for the FY 2006 Budget,"" is a routine ""process document"" to help agency officials begin establishing budget procedures for 2006. In no way should it be interpreted as a final policy decision, or even a planning document, he said.

""Agencies have asked for this sort of direction,"" Young said. ""Budgeting is basically a year-long process, and you have to start somewhere. They'll get more guidance as the year goes along.""

The funding levels referred to in the memo would be a tiny slice out of the federal budget -- $2.3 billion, or 0.56 percent, out of the $412.7 billion requested for fiscal 2005 for domestic programs and homeland security that is subject to Congress's annual discretion.

But the cuts are politically sensitive, targeting popular programs that Bush has been touting on the campaign trail. The Education Department; a nutrition program for women, infants and children; Head Start; and homeownership, job-training, medical research and science programs all face cuts in 2006.

""Despite [administration] denials, this memorandum confirms what we suspected all along,"" said Thomas S. Kahn, Democratic staff director on the House Budget Committee. ""Next February, the administration plans to propose spending cuts in key government services to pay for oversized tax cuts.""

But with the budget deficit exceeding $400 billion this year, tough and painful cuts are unavoidable, said Brian M. Riedl, a budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Federal agencies' discretionary spending has risen 39 percent in the past three years. ""I think the public is ready for spending cuts,"" Riedl said. ""Not only does the public understand there's a lot of waste in the federal budget, but the public is ready to make sacrifices during the war on terror.""

The administration has widely touted a $1.7 billion increase in discretionary funding for the Education Department in its 2005 budget, but the 2006 guidance would pare that back by $1.5 billion. The Department of Veterans Affairs is scheduled to get a $519 million spending increase in 2005, to $29.7 billion, and a $910 million cut in 2006 that would bring its budget below the 2004 level.

Also slated for cuts are the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the Small Business Administration, the Transportation Department, the Social Security Administration, the Interior Department and the Army Corps of Engineers.

Agencies would have the option of preserving current funding levels for programs under their control if they find money from other parts of their budget. But the computer printout contains specific program cuts.

The Women, Infants and Children nutrition program was funded at $4.7 billion for the fiscal year beginning in October, enough to serve the 7.9 million people expected to be eligible. But in 2006, the program would be cut by $122 million. Head Start, the early-childhood education program for the poor, would lose $177 million, or 2.5 percent of its budget, in fiscal 2006.

The $78 million funding increase that Bush has touted for a homeownership program in 2005 would be nearly reversed in 2006 with a $53 million cut. National Institutes of Health spending would be cut 2.1 percent in 2006, to $28 billion, after a $764 million increase for 2005 that brought the NIH budget to $28.6 billion.

Even homeland security -- a centerpiece of the Bush reelection campaign -- would be affected. Funding would slip in 2006 by $1 billion, to $29.6 billion, although that would still be considerably higher than the $26.6 billion devoted to that field in 2004, according to an analysis of the computer printout by House Budget Committee Democrats.

Publicly, the administration has been dismissive of such figures. In February, Young said spending levels beyond 2005 were generated by a computer after administration policymakers set a growth limit of 3 percent for all programs, including defense, but set out multiyear decisions for only a handful of major initiatives.

Education Secretary Roderick R. Paige told House members in February: ""It is my understanding that long-term estimates are calculated by formula. OMB has advised us that the numbers beyond 2005 do not reflect detailed policy decisions by this administration. They are roughly held estimates, and so we will have to await the policy decisions to draw conclusions about what the funding level will be in years outside or years in front of 2005.""

The May 19 memo contains no such caveats.

""Continuing the strategy of last year's Budget, the 2006 Budget will constrain discretionary and mandatory spending while supporting national priorities: winning the war on terror, protecting the homeland, and strengthening the economy,"" the memo states.</lj-cut>

What's particularly telling to me is ""But the cuts are politically sensitive, targeting popular programs that Bush has been touting on the campaign trail. The Education Department; a nutrition program for women, infants and children; Head Start; and homeownership, job-training, medical research and science programs all face cuts in 2006.""
So I ask... how can anyone trust this ""man""????"

"event","This is rather interesting. Recently, there was talk of a new draft. It was all dismissed as crazy talk, but it seems as though it may not have been. There are two pieces of legislation in the House and Senate. This ""action item"" contends that the administration is trying to push it through quietly. (I'm not saying this is from a news source, but the two bills do exist, as does the information about new funding to the Selective Service.

There is pending legislation in the House and Senate (twin bills: S 89 and HR 163) which will time the program's initiation so the draft can begin at early as Spring 2005 -- just after the 2004 presidential election. The administration is quietly trying to get these bills passed now, while the public's attention is on the elections, so our action on this is needed immediately. 

$28 million has been added to the 2004 Selective Service System (SSS) budget to prepare for a military draft that could start as early as June 15, 2005. Selective Service must report to Bush on March 31, 2005 that the system, which has lain dormant for decades, is ready for activation. Please see website: www.sss.gov/perfplan_fy2004.html to view the sss annual performance plan - fiscal year 2004.

The pentagon has quietly begun a public campaign to fill all 10,350 draft board positions and 11,070 appeals board slots nationwide.. Though this is an unpopular election year topic, military experts and influential members of congress are suggesting that if Rumsfeld's prediction of a ""long, hard slog"" in Iraq and Afghanistan [and a permanent state of war on ""terrorism""] proves accurate, the U.S. may have no choice but to draft. 

Congress brought twin bills, S. 89 and HR 163 forward this year, http://www.hslda.org/legislation/na...s89/default.asp entitled the Universal National Service Act of 2003, ""to provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons [age 18--26] in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes."" These active bills currently sit in the committee on armed services. 

Dodging the draft will be more difficult than those from the Vietnam era. 

College and Canada will not be options. In December 2001, Canada and the U.S. signed a ""smart border declaration,"" which could be used to keep would-be draft dodgers in. Signed by Canada's minister of foreign affairs, John Manley, and U.S. Homeland Security director, Tom Ridge, the declaration involves a 30-point plan which implements, among other things, a ""pre-clearance agreement"" of people entering and departing each country. Reforms aimed at making the draft more equitable along gender and class lines also eliminates higher education as a shelter. Underclassmen would only be able to postpone service until the end of their current semester. Seniors would have until the end of the academic year. 

Even those voters who currently support US actions abroad may still object to this move, knowing their own children or grandchildren will not have a say about whether to fight. Not that it should make a difference, but this plan, among other things, eliminates higher education as a 
shelter and includes women in the draft. 

The public has a right to air their opinions about such an important decision. 

Please send this on to all the friends, parents, aunts and uncles, grandparents, and cousins that you know. Let your children know too -- it's their future, and they can be a powerful voice for change! 

Please also contact your representatives to ask them why they aren't telling their constituents about these bills -- and contact newspapers and other media outlets to ask them why they're not covering this important story."

U.S. Deletes, Alters Gender Issue Web Data -Report
Wed Apr 28, 2004 06:13 PM ET 

By Deborah Zabarenko
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Bush administration has stripped information on a range of women's issues from government Web sites, apparently in pursuit of a political agenda, researchers reported on Wednesday.

""Vital information is being deleted, buried, distorted and has otherwise gone missing from government Web sites and publications,"" Linda Basch, president of the National Council for Research on Women, said in a telephone interview.
<lj-cut text=""Click here for the dirty details."">
""Taken cumulatively, this has an enormously negative effect on women and girls.""

A council report said the missing information fell into four categories: women's health; their economic status; objective scientific data; and information aimed at protecting women and girls and helping them advance.

The deletions and alterations appear to hew to a political agenda, rather than providing the nonpartisan, unbiased data that has been the tradition of U.S. government reports, the council said.

Its report cited a fact sheet from the Centers of Disease Control that focused on the advantages of using condoms to prevent sexually transmitted disease; it was revised in December 2002 to say evidence on condoms' effectiveness in curbing these diseases was inconclusive.

The National Cancer Institute's Web site was changed in 2002 to say studies linking abortion and breast cancer were inconsistent; after an outcry from scientists, the institute later amended that to say abortion is not associated with increased breast cancer risk.

25 PUBLICATIONS DELETED

At the Labor Department's Women's Bureau Web site, the report said 25 key publications on subjects ranging from pay equity to child care to issues relating to black and Latina women and women business owners had been deleted with no explanation.

Key government offices dedicated to addressing the needs of women have been disbanded, according to the report. These include the Office of Women's Initiatives and Outreach in the White House and the President's Interagency Council on Women.

At the Pentagon, the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services was slated to be dismantled but was saved after an outcry. However, the report said this committee now focused on issues such as health care for servicewomen and the effects of deployment on families, but not on equity and access issues.

In the area of scientific objectivity, the report said two advisory committees recommended the Food and Drug Administration approve a contraceptive known as Plan B as a nonprescription drug but were blocked by political pressure from doing so.

Regarding violence against women, the report said the U.S. attorney general, as of March 2004, had failed to conduct and publish a study required under the 2000 Violence Against Women Act to investigate discrimination against domestic violence victims in getting insurance.

The White House did not immediately return a call for comment.</lj-cut>

I'll say it again, this is appalling. Utterly appalling. I don't mean to stereotype (and am aware I'm about to), but how do women support a candidate like this? How do minorities (non-hispanic minorities) and gay/lesbians support him? Somebody please answer this for me."

Senate Partisanship Worst in Memory
Key Legislation Languishes as Democrats and Republicans Jockey for Power

By Helen Dewar
Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday, May 2, 2004; Page A05

The Senate was bogged down in its latest snarl last Wednesday when an angry John McCain (R-Ariz.) blurted out publicly what many colleagues have been muttering in private: ""Why don't we just go home . . . rather than go through this charade of telling Americans that we are legislating?""
	

McCain's tart observation reflected the paralysis that has gripped the Senate this year. The Senate is famously known for its painfully slow pace and legislative quicksand, and few had high hopes for significant achievements this year. But a breakdown in comity, the razor-thin GOP majority and expectations of a tight battle for Senate control in November have combined to produced one of the worst Senate stalemates in memory.<lj-cut text=""Click here for the entire article"">

The list of stalled legislation is long, on issues ranging from energy and welfare to compensation for asbestos victims and curbs on medical malpractice lawsuits and other forms of civil litigation. Foreign tariffs have been imposed on many American products while the Senate dawdled over a bill to substitute corporate tax cuts for subsidies that have been outlawed by the World Trade Organization.

Senate Democrats, angry at being excluded from final decisions on bills, are balking at authorizing House-Senate conferences on several measures, including the huge highway funding bill, unless they can work out key points in preliminary negotiations. Action on President Bush's judicial nominations has ground to a halt. Even a relatively noncontroversial bill to reauthorize State Department and foreign aid programs was shelved by Republicans after Democrats signaled they would try to add unrelated amendments on issues such as raising the minimum wage.

Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) complained that the Senate has become ""a factory that manufactures sound-bite votes that make great fodder for 30-second political ads"" but do little to advance important legislation. If this continues, Byrd added, the Senate will become ""little more than an insignificant arm of the political parties, and we may as well lower the flag that flies over this Capitol and wave the white flag of surrender in its place.""

For sure, there are occasional breakthroughs, as when the Senate broke a months-long deadlock last Thursday and approved a four-year extension of a ban on taxing Internet access.

Democrats accuse Republicans of arrogance, mismanagement and trampling on their rights as the minority party. Republicans accuse Democrats of political point-scoring and ""obstructionism"" to keep Bush and the GOP-controlled Congress from claiming legislative accomplishments.

Just to prove their point, Republicans bring up bills that they know will get killed by a Democratic filibuster, while Democrats roll out amendment after amendment on sensitive issues, hoping to put Republicans on the spot.

In a move that infuriated many Democrats, Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) is breaking with Senate tradition by raising money to try to defeat Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.). Frist plans to go to South Dakota later this month to campaign for Daschle's Republican opponent, former House member John Thune.

Many Republicans, including McCain, were angered when Daschle, without warning them, tried to amend the Internet bill to include incentives for production of corn-based ethanol -- a big issue in his reelection campaign. Several Senate aides from both parties said Daschle might not have ambushed Frist on the issue if Frist had not committed to working for Daschle's defeat.

Unless the Senate suddenly changes its ways, the outlook is for, at best, sporadic breakthroughs on legislation where politics dictates action, such as the recently approved victims rights legislation and the Internet tax bill. But few if any senators have been heard to claim that major achievements requiring bipartisan support are likely this year, with the probable exception of the politically popular highway bill. Instead, candidates are already arguing over which party is most responsible for the failures.

The House has passed some but not all of the bills that are jammed up in the Senate and has only a modest agenda for the year. But the outlook for successful House-Senate conferences is unclear.

With all of this in mind, Byrd joined McCain in the critics' circle Thursday. Byrd was particularly upset by issues that he said the Senate was avoiding. Where is the debate over Iraq, financing for Social Security and Medicare, or increasing the competitiveness of American workers? he asked. ""Have we lost the will to legislate?""

Byrd also took aim at the influence of the White House on Republican lawmakers, especially when it tries to dictate the outcome of House-Senate negotiations. ""There was a time when the Senate was an independent body, not the errand boy of the White House,"" he said.

As for Frist's campaigning against Daschle, Byrd said it used to be taboo for one Senate leader to campaign actively against another. ""Has honor gone, too?"" he asked. ""Who cares about honor when a Senate seat might be gained?""

The similar messages from McCain and Byrd are significant because Byrd, the Democratic traditionalist, and McCain, the Republican maverick, do not often see eye to eye. They disagree strongly on Iraq, with McCain urging more U.S. forces while Byrd wants them to come home. During the 1990s, they even faced off before the Supreme Court when Byrd successfully challenged one of McCain's major legislative achievements: passage of a bill giving presidents ""line-item"" veto authority for spending bills.

But they both care deeply about the Senate and its performance, as do many other senators who are distressed about the high level of politically inspired gridlock in a chamber that relies heavily on comity and cooperation to get anything done.

It is difficult, however, for a senator or small group of senators to muster support for the sacrifices needed from both parties to pass legislation in a closely divided Senate, where Republicans control 51 of 100 votes but find it hard to get the 60 votes needed to overcome filibusters. With control of the Senate appearing to be up for grabs in November, political self-sacrifice is not a priority for either party.

The next test for the Senate will come early this week when it resumes work on the corporate tax bill, only days after tariffs imposed by the European Union will have grown from 6 percent to 7 percent. First out of the box will be an amendment by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) to overturn limitations on overtime pay that were recently imposed by the Labor Department.

Republicans failed in two previous attempt to block such ""non-germane"" amendments and finally agreed, after protracted negotiations, to a list of as many as 80 amendments -- 50 of them from their own ranks -- that might be considered in connection with the bill. But Frist has not ruled out another bid to limit amendments, which could provoke another filibuster fight. </lj-cut>

It bothers me legislators have forgotten what their jobs are supposed to be. I'm sick and tired of partisian BS. I understand the lure of candidates like Ralph Nader.  Where did it all go wrong? I point to Newt Gingrich and the constant barrage against Bill Clinton. Why work with the other party, if they don't think they have to work with you. Was it problematic before then? When we have senators on the floor, like Bill Frist, attacking presidential candidates instead of doing their jobs, we have a complete breakdown in the system. It isn't supposed to be this way. Opinions?"

1. The Bush Administration keeps cutting back on social services so that the poor have no choice but to join up to have access to any basic needs. 
2. The Bush Administration is against abortion and birth control because they want minorities to have more children in poverty so that those children will have to join the military to have access to any basic needs. 

Very grassy knoll, but interesting theories I thought."

Marching for their lives
Pro-choice activists are mobilizing for Washington with new urgency: As more than a dozen states aim to outlaw reproductive rights, a nationwide abortion ban could be next.

April 21, 2004  |  When an expected 1 million women descend on Washington this Sunday for the March for Women's Lives, it will be hard for the Bush administration not to hear their rallying cry in support of reproductive rights. For some pro-choice leaders who will be there, the message to be delivered en masse will be charged with vivid personal experience and decades of dedication to the issue.

""I had an illegal abortion when I was 15,"" says Renee Chelian, executive director of Northland Family Planning Center, which runs three abortion clinics in Detroit. ""Now I'm 53 years old, and I've been working for legal abortion my entire adult life. I would like to work on other issues, maybe help battered women and children, but I'm still fighting the same battle I was in 1974.""

Michigan is one of the many states where reproductive rights have been perpetually under siege since the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade legalized abortion in 1973. ""The right-wing extremists have lost none of their momentum,"" says Chelian, who has seen the ebb and flow of reproductive battles for 30 years. ""In fact, it has picked up since George Bush has been in office.""

<lj-cut text=""Full article click here"">

It is in these states where the battle is intensifying, not only to put limits such as parental consent on abortion, and to inhibit family planning -- even preventing women from getting emergency contraception and the birth control pill -- but ultimately to overturn Roe vs. Wade. Indeed, the April 25 march on Washington, supported by a range of reproductive-rights groups from across the country, is propelled by a new urgency: Conservative politicians in more than a dozen states have been pushing radical anti-abortion legislation that, if it were to pass, would almost certainly thrust the issue before the Supreme Court once again. With vacancy on the top bench imminent, and with George W. Bush potentially deciding who fills the seat (or seats) if he wins reelection, that's a chilling prospect for advocates of reproductive rights.

Just last month, South Dakota came within one vote of enacting a sweeping anti-abortion law that would have outlawed the procedure entirely at any stage of pregnancy with the only exception being that of saving the woman's life. Republican Gov. Mike Rounds and many South Dakota legislators boasted that the law could become the nation's first direct challenge to Roe vs. Wade should George W. Bush get reelected and have the opportunity to appoint several anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court. The apparent strategy is to enact an unconstitutional law in order to draw a court challenge that would make its way up to the Supreme Court -- just as Bush's appointees are joining other conservatives on the bench.

While the bill in South Dakota failed this time, it had passed both houses of the state Legislature. Despite supporting the bill, Gov. Rounds sent it back to the general assembly with a few technical changes. It came within a hairbreadth of passing a second time, even though it was such an extreme measure that the anti-abortion advocacy organization National Right to Life didn't support it, stating that it was ""the right bill at the wrong time."" Not only would it have banned the procedure, but it would have imposed a prison sentence of up to 15 years. Because the vote was so close, that probably won't be the last time the South Dakota Legislature takes up the measure.

""We've been a testing ground for the most radical things they can dream up,"" says Thelma Underberg, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice South Dakota. ""I checked the names of the people who testified [at the bill's hearing]. Very few people who testified were from South Dakota. It was well orchestrated by the Thomas More Law Center of Michigan, which was started by that fellow that owned Domino's Pizza,"" says Underberg, referring to Tom Monaghan, a conservative who has been a major funding source for anti-abortion and anti-gay activism. ""They came in and got a legislator who was willing to carry the legislation.""

South Dakota isn't the only state that has attempted to ban abortion outright. A bill in the Georgia Legislature would ""provide that any person seeking to have an abortion ... shall first file a petition in the Superior Court."" The bill also stipulates that the woman must have a jury trial, and that the court shall balance the rights of the fetus against the rights of the person seeking to have an abortion, and finally that ""no abortion shall take place unless ordered by the court.""

In one of the more macabre state-level anti-abortion tactics, a bill was introduced to the Oklahoma Legislature that would require a woman considering an abortion to obtain a death warrant. ""That bill would prohibit a physician from performing an 'execution' without obtaining a death warrant,"" says Anita Fream of Planned Parenthood of Oklahoma. ""It's anybody's guess what that referred to. But we see between 15 and 20 anti-choice bills of various kinds every year, so you can't stay on top of them all. For example, we've had a bill proposed that would allow any minor who got an abortion without parental consent to sue the physician for malpractice without any statute of limitations, even though minors aren't required to get parental consent in Oklahoma.""

Iowa is another state that is considering a bill that would require a woman to obtain permission from a judge before getting an abortion. Under this measure, the judge would appoint a guardian for the embryo or fetus and then conduct a mini-trial to determine if she should be forced to go forward with the pregnancy. There is no exception in this legislation for the health or even life of the woman. ""That bill was so extreme, even the leadership [of the state legislature], which is anti-choice, didn't let the bill go forward,"" says Brenda Kole of NARAL Pro-Choice Iowa.

According to Planned Parenthood, 14 states have introduced 29 bills banning abortion outright.

""There has been a long-term strategy to make abortion illegal at the state level,"" says Nancy Northup, an attorney and the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights in New York City. ""What people don't understand is that states want to have these laws on the books and ready to go when Roe is challenged again in the Supreme Court. Two states, Alabama and Delaware, have pre-Roe anti-abortion laws still on the books. And two more states, Louisiana and Utah, have passed laws to make abortion illegal since Roe. Those state laws, and any others that are passed in the meantime, will immediately go into effect should Roe be overturned.""

Not all attempts to severely restrict abortion are quite so blatant. Back in Michigan, two court cases have already been fought over so-called partial-birth abortion laws, where the legislation was struck down both times on the grounds that the wording was so vague that abortions as early as 10 weeks could be restricted.

""If they would pass a narrowly tailored bill to ban a specific procedure,"" says Chelian, referring to intact dilation and extraction, ""we probably wouldn't even challenge it. But they keep coming back with this vague language, so we go to court, and every time we win the case, we also get to collect attorney's fees from the state. It's the state that has to pay for the court challenge, not the anti-choice groups who push it through. It's such a waste of the taxpayers' money.""

Most recently, the Michigan Legislature passed the Legal Birth Definition Act that -- in addition to including the vague partial-birth language yet again -- defines fetal viability so vaguely as to allow restrictions on abortion in the first trimester. Gov. Jennifer Granholm vetoed the bill, but a rarely used citizen's initiative will likely succeed in getting it enacted anyway. In Michigan, if enough signatures are collected in support of a bill, it must be taken up by the Legislature, and if it passes with a simple majority, it automatically becomes law. The governor cannot veto it. More than enough signatures have been gathered and submitted to the secretary of state for verification, which will be certified sometime this month. Since the legislation already passed the Michigan Legislature once, it is all but guaranteed to succeed again, only this time the governor will have nothing to say about it. Once again, the courts will have to be the backstop.

""The [proponents of the citizen's initiative] are following an avenue that is allowed to them under the law,"" says Liz Boyd, a spokeswoman for Gov. Granholm. ""But any new law that is identical to the bill that the governor vetoed, which she did because it didn't have an exception for the health of the woman, will be struck down by the courts."" The Michigan ACLU has already indicated it will bring a court challenge if the bill becomes law.

Not all attacks on a woman's right to reproductive freedom are coming in the form of state legislation. Last fall a concrete supplier launched a boycott of a new clinic being built by Planned Parenthood in Austin, Texas. The boycott spread to every contractor in a 60-mile radius. After the initial setback, Planned Parenthood was besieged with calls from people willing to help. Planned Parenthood became its own contractor and has had to protect its subcontractors from harassment by refusing to release the companies' names. Still, protesters show up at the construction site with zoom lenses and threaten to post photographs of workers on the Web. Despite the ongoing harassment, the clinic's construction schedule is back on track and is set to open in the fall of 2004.

Of course, the anti-abortion movement hasn't limited itself to stopping abortion.

Women's right to reproductive freedom has come under such severe attack that access to emergency contraception and even the pill are increasingly threatened. Just last month, two cases arose in Texas that seem to be isolated incidents but are in fact part of a larger trend. In one case a pharmacist in Denton, Texas, refused to fill a woman's emergency contraception prescription -- even though she had just been raped. The drug store chain, Eckerd, immediately fired the pharmacist.

Another pharmacist in north Texas refused to fill a 32-year-old woman's prescription for the pill. Julee Lacey, a wife, mother and first-grade teacher, was incensed and took her story to the media. In this case, the pharmacy was CVS. ""Our constituents who are outraged about this want to support pharmacies that react quickly and do the right thing, as Eckerd did,"" says Emily Snooks, executive director of Planned Parenthood of North Texas. ""Well, now we come to find out that CVS is buying Eckerd. We can't get an answer out of CVS about what they're going to do to prevent this from happening again and whether or not that pharmacist will be terminated.""

CVS has said that if a pharmacist objects to filling a prescription, he or she should refer the customer to a pharmacist who can be of assistance. Beyond that, the company hasn't elaborated on its policy or said if any disciplinary action was taken against the pharmacist who refused to dispense the pill. As it stands, Texas law does not protect pharmacists who object to filling certain prescriptions, but that may change. So-called conscious-clause legislation, which seeks to protect pharmacists from having to fill prescriptions that they morally object to, is yet another trend sweeping state legislatures.

While most of the proposed conscious-clause bills started out by protecting pharmacists who don't want to dispense RU-486, also known as an abortifacient, Virginia has gone so far as to consider a bill that would declare fertilization as the beginning of life. This would classify emergency contraception, the pill, the IUD and other methods of contraception that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus as abortifacients. Pharmacists who are already exempt from having to dispense RU-486 could not be fired by the company for refusing to dispense birth control and emergency contraception under this definition.

After a pharmacist in Cincinnati was terminated for refusing to dispense the pill and emergency contraception at least 10 times during her seven years of employment at K-Mart, a conscious-clause bill was introduced in the Ohio Legislature to protect pharmacists from being disciplined. ""Wider access to emergency contraception is the single most promising avenue for reducing this country's rate of unintended pregnancy,"" says Chrisse France, the executive director of Preterm, a nonprofit abortion clinic in Cleveland.

While pro-choice organizations and civil rights groups battle to keep contraception available, anti-abortion groups have opened another front: going after family planning funding. According to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, just this year 12 states have introduced bills that would eliminate all family planning funding to organizations that even discuss the option of abortion or refer women to clinics that perform abortions. Last year, six states succeeded in defunding family planning: Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.

""The [Texas] Legislature passed a bill that attempts to take away federal funding for family planning and require any family planning clinic to suspend any abortion services,"" says Snooks, executive director of Planned Parenthood of North Texas. ""All the Planned Parenthood affiliates in Texas had to file a lawsuit against the state and get an injunction. The court will hear testimony regarding this issue on May 3. If we lose, that would be a loss of $13 million to clinics across Texas.

""If people knew that contraception is now being threatened, they would be outraged,"" continues Snooks, who believes that people are starting to wake up to what's happening at the state level. ""We have a whole contingent of people going to Washington, D.C., for the march,"" says Snooks. ""Most people don't think of North Texas as a hotbed of activism, but people are getting upset."""

$700 million here, $700 million there

Paul Wolfowitz may have overreached yesterday when he cited scruples in the administration's secret channeling of money earmarked for the war in Afghanistan and counterterrorism into its covert planning for the Iraq war without telling Congress. The administration tried ""scrupulously"" to live up to legal obligations to tell Congress, he told the Senate Armed Services Committee.

But even some Republican members of Congress aren't buying Wolfowitz's spin, including GOP Sen. John McCain, who said on Tuesday that there would be hearings into possible fund diversions and ""the mechanics of moving money around.""

A new Center for American Progress backgrounder looks at the administration's legal obligation to tell Congress if it diverted appropriations to its Iraq mission."

Tracking the spoils of war

Marketplace started a four-part radio series on Tuesday called ""Spoils of War"", on the rampant corruption that is the rebuilding of Baghdad. From the Web site:

""The spoils of war add up to more than capturing expansive palaces and luxury cars. As Marketplace reporters have discovered, not all of the $22 billion being spent to rebuild Iraq is going where it should. Who's watching the money as it streams through Baghdad? Just about no one, and bribes and black marketeering are rampant, witnesses say. A leading anti-corruption group claims as much as 90 percent of U.S. money spent in Iraq is being lost to corruption. From Halliburton subsidiaries charging double for gas, Iraqi officials and Arabic translators unrestrained from pocketing millions of dollars, or even members of the interim governing Council accusing each other of taking tens of millions in bribes. Trouble is, the root of the problem can't be found anywhere near the Green Zone. Try the White House, and Capitol Hill, where oversight of Iraqi construction crews and U.S. contractors like Halliburton has only just begun to be assigned ... more than a year after the war began."""

I think the mere fact that Rumsfeld did this speaks volumes about this administration. I'm curious how you right wingers see this. Doesn't this bother you?

Pentagon Deleted Rumsfeld Comment 
Remark to Saudi About War's Certainty Is Not in Internet Transcript of Interview 

By Mike Allen
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, April 21, 2004; Page A01 


The Pentagon deleted from a public transcript a statement Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld made to author Bob Woodward suggesting that the administration gave Saudi Arabia a two-month heads-up that President Bush had decided to invade Iraq.

At issue was a passage in Woodward's ""Plan of Attack,"" an account published this week of Bush's decision making about the war, quoting Rumsfeld as telling Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, in January 2003 that he could ""take that to the bank"" that the invasion would happen.

The comment came in a key moment in the run-up to the war, when Rumsfeld and other officials were briefing Bandar on a military plan to attack and invade Iraq, and pointing to a top-secret map that showed how the war plan would unfold. The book reports that the meeting with Bandar was held on Jan. 11, 2003, in Vice President Cheney's West Wing office. Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also attended.

<lj-cut text=""Click here to see the full text of the article"">

Pentagon officials omitted the discussion of the meeting from a transcript of the Woodward interview that they posted on the Defense Department's Web site Monday. Rumsfeld told reporters at a briefing yesterday that he may have used the phrase ""take that to the bank"" but that no final decision had been made to go to war.

""To my knowledge, a decision had not been taken by the president to go to war at that meeting,"" Rumsfeld said. ""There was certainly nothing I said that should have suggested that, and any suggestion to the contrary would not be accurate.""

Woodward supplied his own transcript showing that Rumsfeld told him on Oct. 23, 2003: ""I remember meeting with the vice president and I think Dick Myers and I met with a foreign dignitary at one point and looked him in the eye and said you can count on this. In other words, at some point we had had enough of a signal from the president that we were able to look a foreign dignitary in the eye and say you can take that to the bank this is going to happen.""

The transcript made it clear that the foreign dignitary Woodward was discussing was Bandar, although Rumsfeld would not say that. ""We're going to have to clean some of this up in the transcript,"" Rumsfeld said in the omitted passage. ""We'll give you a -- I mean you just said Bandar and I didn't agree with that so we're going to have to -- I don't want to say who it is but you are going to have to go through that and find a way to clean up my language too.""

All told, the Pentagon transcript omits a series of eight questions and answers, some of them just a few words each. Yesterday Rumsfeld described the deleted passages as ""some banter.""

Larry DiRita, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said the deletion was an honest disagreement and defense officials were reviewing the passage to determine whether to restore it to the published version.

""I had discussions with the author about passages that would be excluded from the transcript by mutual agreement, and this passage was one of those sections,"" he said. ""It was excluded specifically because the secretary was not in a position to validate or confirm the details that the author was raising.""

Woodward said: ""As the transcript shows, it was not off the record. I was surprised that it was deleted because it obviously dealt with a critical issue and was important corroborating information for the book. I asked DiRita to restore it on the Pentagon Web site.""

Rumsfeld's comments came on a day when fallout from the book's many disclosures continued to dominate conversations throughout Washington. Rumsfeld, who gave Woodward two lengthy interviews after Bush asked his Cabinet to cooperate, was a rare dissenter in an administration that has embraced the book despite the mixed portrayal it offers of Bush's campaign to unseat Saddam Hussein.

Stephanie Cutter, communications director for Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry, said the book ""raises serious doubts about the president's planning for war with Iraq, and what his war cabinet knew or didn't know.""

But Bush's closest aides, who typically resist efforts to pull back the Oval Office curtains, are actively promoting sales of the book.

""We're urging people to buy the book,"" White House communications director Dan Bartlett said. ""What this book does is show a president who was asking the right questions and showing prudence as well as resolve during very difficult times. This book undermines a lot of the critics' charges.""

An official involved in the negotiations said the administration cooperated so completely that Bush asked Cheney to grant Woodward an interview, which Cheney did, although he is not named as a source. Woodward writes in the book that information came from ""more than 75 key people directly involved in the events,"" most of whom spoke on the condition that they not be identified.

The Pentagon posted transcripts of both Woodward interviews with Rumsfeld, and they show that Rumsfeld was more recalcitrant than other administration figures. He complained about Woodward's questions in a past meeting, saying that ""almost everything you asked me was premised with an assertion that was either incomplete or wrong."" Woodward is quoted as gently reminding Rumsfeld that the president ""wants me to do this.""

At Rumsfeld's briefing yesterday, he said that he remembered the session in Cheney's office with Bandar but that it was not unlike others ""we had with any number of neighboring countries as the buildup towards the -- to support the diplomacy, the flow of forces was taking place.

""We had the obligation to try to do it in the most cost-effective and responsible way, and the way that would best fit General [Tommy R.] Franks's plans, in the event that he did in fact ultimately have to go to war,"" Rumsfeld said, referring to the former head of the U.S. Central Command. ""That meant we had to talk to the countries in the region and work out things at ports or airfields and that type of thing.""

After being handed a note later in the briefing, Rumsfeld returned to the transcript and said that it might omit ""some discussion about a totally unrelated topic, and some items that were agreed between us . . . that were off the record.""

""But I can say of certain knowledge that nothing was taken out that would naysay what I just indicated in my response to the question,"" Rumsfeld said.

""No 18-minute gap?"" a reporter asked, referring to the notorious deletion from a Watergate tape.

Amid laughter, Rumsfeld said: ""You can take that to the bank."""

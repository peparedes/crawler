"event","nothing's really happened over the week. but we've got monday off. i have such a bad headache. omg. sign man left. pff, fine then. LEAVE ME AND HALEY. WE DON'T CARE. *runs off crying...* i was in a bad mood all week...once i got home anyway. i can't deal with hodgie he's so god damn annoying. and i always have head aches and they're always because of him because he never fucking shuts-up. i didn't go to boxing. i'm dissapointed with meee self. i had a dream that i was there...kinda... not. and Zach showed up..except he was alot younger and was really short. i wanna go to boxing, but i hate taking the bus alone. and it's so far. and i hate going alone because i can't think of anything to do on the bags. and i'd join the class but they do like 5 minutes on the bag and that's all. and it's retarded and right at the end of class and i have nothing to do and i mostly just feel stupid. but i always have to go alone because liz always has some invisible stick up her ass. my head is pounding and i fucking hate everything right now. everyone i know should burn to the ground. my days are pointless. I AM pointless. i have a 58 in math. that's pathetic. no excuse either. i just don't care anymore. i don't like how anyone teaches everything. mr.mann is fucking retard, he rambles on and never gives us any notes and i get bored and read or sleep or seriously zone out and wake up when fucking creepy-ass albino comes over and hovers around me. and in math she's so boring. the sound of her voice is like hell it's self. ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON... for fucks sake. all we do is take notes...which i don't take. and she just repeats everything she's already said...not that i listen. actually i wouldn't know what she said, but to me it's all the same shit. we sit in the dark taking notes with her rambling. but i can't fall asleep because her voice DRILLS it's way into my head making reading or doing anything IMPOSSIBLE. and ya know heaven forbid i take the notes..but i'm really just THAT lazy and i don't feel like trying anyway. what's the point? oh right, there is none. the only thing i'm concerned about is when my parents find out and i get in deep shit. either way i sit ALONE in all my classes. being bored. wanting anything to fucking happen that is romotly interesting and entertaining. but no. i sit and DO NOTHING. i stare at ppl. way for the school to put in none of my friends classes. like way to make school just that much more of a torture. every single mofoing day....i sit alone. in bordom. and i've got ALL next semester to look forward to. being even MORE alone.

"event","i know i shouldn't be saying this but it'll come out some day. ya know what really pushes my botton. well i'll tell ya. when fucking retards like lauryn and lauren decide to be retards. first of all, why would lauren accept taking fag girl in? did anyone want to consult ME in any of this. did everyone just forget about me and that i was ALSO a part of this exchange. it went both ways ya know. oo everyone pitied poor stupid stuck up fag gurl, but what about me? did anyone think that i was having a hard time with this? did anyone ever think about how my quebec hopes are now gone? ANYONE? obviously not. and no one seems to understand how much i hate her. and yet everyones nice to her and hangs out with her and now everyones best friends with her. and no one seems to understand how much that bugs me. lauryn can go be friends with her all she wants. i don't even like lauryn anyway. but ya know, the fact that she now wants to stay with fag gurl in quebec for three months, ya well that's not fucking fair. what in the world would ever make her think that SHE would ever be selected to go to quebec. you have to have good grades, you have to be well respected by the teachers. u have to want to try in school. and she really doesn't fall into ANY of those catagories. does anyone know that i had to go thro so much hell to be picked the first time, with the school. and then thro out the province. like it was amazing that i was picked. and now someone who's not even qualified gets to go? like that's not fucking fair. it seems that everyone else in the fuking world has gotten something out of this, except me. the only thing i got out of this is, long hours talking to fucking teachers and staying after school late talking about this, soo much time and energie WASTED, another bad memorie to add to my collection, and another enemie. when u guys go out and  invite her and invite me, you do realize that i'm not gonna come because of her. and then u go on with plans anyway. it's too bad that u don't value my friendship enough. and if your not willing to try and grasp my fucking hatred towards her and understand that she makes me uncomfortable yet do nothing about it and continue to do stuff with her, then you can all rot in fucking hell and NEVER talk to me again. i'm not saying don't be nice to her, but i mean, really think about. if only for a fucking milliseconde, you'd c where i'm coming at."

"event","i forgot my shorts at school so i couldn't go boxing. but it gave me a nice night to myself. not that the night is over or antyhing. tomorrows ""friday"". maybe i'll go boxing then. prolly not. but ah well. today was interesting. was like 3 minutes late for science but well it beats ten. it beats not showing up at all. then gym. BOOOOOOOOOOOORING. then lunch...lunch was stupid. and then math. FUCKING SHOOT ME. i was pissy for some reason. math is so boring. and i was on the verge of crying. and for no reason! and i'm not tired. and i'm not mood swingy no-more and...hmmm. i have alot to look forward too and that's what i live off of. and no homework... and freedom tonight. yet... pookyness still prevailed. beats me. i'm fine now. my hands are sticky tho...from icecream..too lazy to wash them. watched gilmore girls. wasn't the best episode...but still darn good. well first i left english early because well... i felt like it. didn't skip tho. i just asked politley if i could leave because i didn't feel good. made some puppy eyes and left. t'was amazing. and just like that i was free. but then when i was wlaking home i realized that i had forgotten my shorts. but was i upset? no!? more freedom for lazyness, which is fine for me. Jt hasn't even phoned asking me to come practice...maybe he got the message. maybe not. who knows. i'm not even horribly upset about the fact that i haven't seen Roland in... like.... a month. just mildly. and i phoned the pet store and... and... over there guinea pigs are only 15 buck-a-roos and starter kits are 64.99 much cheaper than at polo. but i liked the guinea pig that was all black except for a little thick white strip down the middle of his face. and i will call him Tommy Brock. so well i like TOmmy Brock better. but he's 30 and at polo. hmm, still. Myabe i shouldn't get 2. cause they'd have to be from the same store. and i only want short haired ones... i think anyway. i haven't really seen up close any long haired ones. maybe they're not that bad. but i don't just want to get a long haired one because there isn;t any short haired ones, know what i mean? well i do, good. i';m wearing pj pants that i haven't worn in...7 months, since i hurt my left knee and they smell like my drawer. if i spelt that right..maybe. well my lip was just twitching a little while ago and i wanted to go look at it in the mirror to c if it was actually moving or if i was just going crazy. but of course by the time i get to the washroom the feeling has stopped right?! just my luck...but i mean,doesn't that happen all the time to everyone! BAH CRAZY WORLD!
 the pet store's open on thursday too. i just want one, JEBUS. i feel stupid going to the petstore and ""just looking"" it's so gay. UUGH. but i think that's all i'm alowd to do on thursday. still. i want Tommy Brock. maybe i'll only get one. less trouble. less food. less fun tho. 2 more food. more trouble, but more fun!!!!!!!! OOO desicions. i saw sergio and miguel today. which is creepy because i only thought that there was one sergio-miguel, but it turns out that there's 2 of them! the one with the crazy eyes is deffiently sergio and the other who's more pointy is miguel! AHAH, it seriously is a crazy ass world. i really need to do some abs. not tonight tho. *shrugs* push-ups for sure tho. *SSSSSSIIIIGH* well i think i'll do some now. but my bros here and he will laugh at my pathetic ness... but SCREW HIM. hooooo, well could only do 7. but it beats the 5 from yesterday. up by 2 everyday! maybe...oh god. *siiigh* i STILL haven't put on deoderant..that might be a probleme. poor hodge no wonder he's acting wyrd. god, i'm killing him with my fumes. but it's 7 and i need to clean my room, apparently it's messy to my mother. but for me, o it's ever so perfect. it gives me excercie having to jump over everything and avoid stepping on breakable things. don't wanna break another mirror... *looks around*"

Nah, it wasn't THAT bad. heavens. i might work tomorrow. but i really don't wanna. i could REALLY use the money tho... but i feel sick. damn c thro walls. i failed the math test. i know it. *shrugs* i did study tho. alot. well i'm proud of myself anyway. i actually got off my ass and did something. turns out broomball isn't on ice. at least not this time anyway. bah. it lasts all week pretty much. won't be able to go to boxing cause my knee will be so tired. well there goes another week wasted. maybe i shouldn't box anymore. i mean...it's not like i'm actually gonna compete. and then..if not..like what's the point? i never c anyone anyway, everyones left there. roland's never there, so why bother going and pretending i can do something when i really can't and it just makes me even more upset. i REALLY need to do abs tho... one of these days i'll start. been starting my weights again, cause i want my arms to be fit for weighttraining. watch, that class will completely suck and it'll be all retard guys and i'll dread going and bah. but i'll look on the bright side. learn some new trick of the trade and yes. free exercise. i still haven't checked when totti plays........... i hate english class. hate. ugh. i have to memorize these fucking lines. piss me off. i'm going 26th. jesus. watch i'll look like shit on monday, JUST WATCH! JUST MY LUCK! i'm really hungry...but food doesn't seem good right now. i saw meg crying at the end of the day, maybe hughies finally dumped her. doubt it tho. aah *siigh* but! i went for my beginers test in dee morning and guess what! that's right! I PASSED! HAAAAAAAAALLLAAAAYLOOYAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!! only 1 wrong! one!! muah! and the woman was in a good mood to. it took me like 10 minutes to write. t'was fast and REALLY easy. jesus i should have gotten that one first. piss me off. *rolls eyes* but ah well. then i got my picture and it's not HORRIBLE, considering i'm starting to accept that i'm just a hideous thing. and it's not the pictures that look bad, it's always been me. but either way, i'm happy. finally god. only a month later *twitch* i gotta phone my driving teacher woman tonight. i think i'll do it now. hmm..what days are good for driving...obviously right after school considering it gets dark at like 5, ugh piss me off even more, so... well not monday... not tuesday..or thursdays..so wenesday then. and friday i guess, if it works like that... i dunno lets find out. and about mr.

ANYTHING. a glass of fucking water. no one got me ice packs. no one helped me with anything.  and didn't offer to help me up the stairs or down. or help me with god damn anything for that matter. i wanna thank ppl for not helping me fucking bathe myself. or do every day stuff, like go to the washroom. because it was that bad. and no know ever knew what i've had to go thro when this happens. 7 times. and everyday i struggle with it. it's not like i can forget it. ever. i can't walk properly. it's very painful to walk up the starts. i've given up on running. my soccer dreams are over for good. i've only been playing for like my whole life. i can't do any normal everyday active stuff and i'm slowly giving up on boxing. the only thing i'm good at and enjoy doing. i like can't do it anymore. and what scares me most is that it's going to happen again. maybe tomorrow, maybe in a couple months, maybe years. but it will happen again. and i can't live thro that encore un fois.

`looks so pathetic compared to others. but it's funny. it really is. don't feel like missing anything tho. tis true.`
maybe i'll ask over the weekend for a guinea pig. give them lots of time to think about it..and then..maybe i'll be able to get... aw man..,but parent teacher. then they'll have something to hang over my head. bah. evidence. proof. shoit. 
we get thrusday and friday off. i'd want to think about the things i'd say before anyone left. i really not impressed with everyone right now.

what? can't relate to me? i'd better shutup then, before someones brain turns on.
 i remember cole..and gib.... i need a good book. don't have any time to read tho. christmas is coming soon. i stock up then. hodgie will be 4 years old on dec 27. it's a pretty date. :)  -as if ppl swear by this thing"

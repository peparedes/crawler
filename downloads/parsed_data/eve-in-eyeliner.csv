"event","The move is a total nightmare! Cat's job is fucking about with the transfer so don't even know when we're moving- we have half the flat in boxes 'cause we're supposed to be in london now!! We no longer have internet 'cause it 'isn't worth renewing the contract for a couple of weeks' says Cat who actually has internet access at work :p Well, hopefully, I'll be back at some stage... I can't live in the dark ages forever..."

"event","Well, I'm only slightly hungover today. Hiding out on the net because Cat keeps hinting that we need get on with our flat hunt. Is there anything worse than flat-hunting? She'll be trying to get me to start packing next! Bit worried about the move. Amoungst other things, I'm not sure how well Bailey (our kitty) will take it. Just hoping he'll adjust to london ok :-/"

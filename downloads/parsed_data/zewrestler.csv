They are as vulnerable as Windows. We don't hear about attacks created to exploit these because their user base is so much smaller than windows. Security through obscurity.  Why write a virus that will infect a small user base when you can rape a large user base instead. We are all weak and exposed. Get over your conceitedness people."

Honestly, how fucking stupid are people these day's that are falling victim to it.  Why do I know people are falling victim? Simple, if this garbage didn't work, then they wouldn't waste their resources sending it out in the first place.  People that fall victim to this, need to just loss their internet privileges. I mean, there is a wide array of phishing attacks these phishers can pick from and they decide to pick this.  Means there's a lot of low hanging fruit out there. *sigh*

And, coming after the Emperor, who is about control, it is a radical change in perspective. LOVE is a force that makes you choose and decide for reasons you often can't understand; it makes you surrender control to a higher power. And that is what this card is all about. Finding something or someone who is so much a part of yourself, so perfectly attuned to you and you to them, that you cannot, dare not resist. This card indicates that the you have or will come across a person, career, challenge or thing that you will fall in love with. You will know instinctively that you must have this, even if it means diverging from your chosen path. No matter the difficulties, without it you will never be complete.</font></p>

I didn't even realize that the U.S. has that much money with so many resources being used for a 2 front war. Nevertheless, that is more money than easily most, if not all the world (except maybe <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Paulson"">Paulson</a>) will ever see.  

So now the question I ask whoever still reads this lj. If you were presented this big ass check for the ungodly amount of money, and you could spend it on whatever you want, what would you do with it all?

If I got that much money, I would first buy an Island. Then, after funding genetic engineering research I would raise an army of humanoid meerkats. Why? Because I think it'd be pretty cool to have your own genetically engineered army, and by that time, all the other cool animals that could be genetically engineered humanoid animals would be copyrighted, so I'd have to take what's left. Thus, Meerkats. In case, they attempt to overthrow me, or just be evil without my permission, I'd make sure each and everyone came equipped with an exploding collar. Next, I'll build the world's most uber powerful computer system and use it to play <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack"">Nethack</a>. Finally, I'll hunt down Bin Laden, and shove a pineapple up his ass. At this point, I'd run out of cool things to do, so I'd store the last 600 billion dollars. Because we all know that I'd be able to accomplish/buy all that within the first 100 billion. 

So, now that I've detailed what I'd do with that kind of money, its your turn to tell me what you'd do."

"event","So we are now in September.  Both presidential candidates have selected their VPs. So putting my political views aside for this entry, I see a hiprocracy or irony in the selection of the running mates. 

First the Obama's camp has been attacking Mccain on being the same old Washington politics. He's also been saying that change is needed and Mccain isn't going to bring it.  Despite that, Obama picks a running mate who has been a Senator for 14 years longer than Mccain.

In Mccain's camp, he has constantly been nailing Obama on how he lacks the experience to be present. What does Mccain do? He picks a running mate who has been questioned several times for being experienced enough to run Alaska, let alone experienced enough to be Vice President.

We are holding the Content Strike because we ache to do something to show our displeasure, and commenting on the news post -- even with cat macros -- just isn't powerful enough!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The strike has four terms:


    * Restore basic accounts for new account creation.


    * Inform users before any change to the site that affects how we use the site or demands on our resources.


    * Run change proposals by the Advisory Board and


    * Take their advice into account before implementation of any change.



NOTE: We're aware that there may be good business decisions for eliminating Basic accounts. If Basic accounts are to be eliminated, though, that action should be taken only after approval of the Advisory Board and consultation with the LJ Community of Users.

***

The 24-hour strike will begin at the following times for the following locations:

Thursday, March 20, 2:00 PM -- Honolulu
Thursday, March 20, 4:00 PM -- Anchorage

The one-day content strike is on for this <div style='display:inline; text-decoration:underline;'>Friday, March 21</div>.

For 24 hours, we will not post or comment to LJ. Not in our own journals, not in communities. Not publicly, privately, or under friends-lock.

This is a protest that will have long-lasting effects, showing up forever in the daily posting statistics.

This is a protest that will not harm LJ in the long run, as leaving LJ might do.

This is a protest that will demonstrate the power of community, as all users unite to support Basic users and the concept of adfree space.

<div style='display:inline; color:#FF0000;'>This is a protest that will educate the new owners that LJ is driven by user-created content.</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How Can I Help?


    * DO post about this in your own LJ.

    * DO post and comment about it in appropriate communities.

    * DO remember that it's based on Greenwich Mean Time, which may not be your local time.

    * DO turn off LoudTwitter and your RSS feeds for 24 hours.


    * DON'T forget to get permission from community mods before making an off-topic post or comment about the strike.

    * DON'T be spammy with your posts or comments about the strike.

    * DON'T forget to turn your LoudTwitter and RSS feeds back on when the strike is over.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I understand the need for a business to make a profit, but I also side with all the long-time loyal LJ lovers.

BRING BACK THE OLD SYSTEM. I have the type of account that lj is planning on discontinuing. If I were to join now, and select from basic, ad-supported or paid, i'd still get basic."

"event","I know people don't always agree with my views.   I start this entry with that disclaimer now. I'll also admit up front that I am not that well versed in this issue.

I stumbled upon this <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/02/20/cnnu.guns/index.html?eref=rss_us"">article tonight</a>, while reading the cnn news feed. The article talks about students in Utah who are exercising their right to carry concealed firearms on campus.  I personally like the idea. With <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_massacre"">VT</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Illinois_University_shooting"">NIU</a>, plus several other not so publicized shootings in that time period, one is eventually going to think, ""would this have happened if a student or teacher had a gun?""  The girl in the article talks about how she doesn't feel safe with a student that may or may not have a gun next to her.  Personally, I think that's a false sense of security. While she may not worry about the person next to her, what about the loony who decides to walk into her class full of unarmed students?  While yes, it is taking matters into ones own hands, and the cops should be there in a matter of minutes, what about the time until they get there?

All in all, I think Chris Rock had the write idea ""Don't go to parties with metal detectors. Sure it fells safe inside,but what about all those niggas waiting outside with guns. They know you aint got one.""  Most schools institute a gun ban, therefore, it is a safe assumption that students don't have guns.  Heck, on and off campus since November there have been 3 armed robberies and one incident where police confiscated a replica rifle used for marching drills. Anyway, that's the general opinion. Any comments?"

"event","I've been a life long Giants fan.  So, it goes without say that I am ecstatic about fact that Giants pulled through this year and got the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLII"">17-14 win</a> against the Patriots. The last couple years its been kind of hard.  Especially, after the humiliations of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXV"">Super Bowl XXXV</a> and the 2006 Season. Any Giants fan that season will <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_New_York_Giants_season#Week_12:_at_Tennessee_Titans"">remember the Titans</a>(no pun intended).  And I'll admit, going into the game, I had my fingers crossed that it wouldn't be an embarrassment as it was with the Ravens. 

In general, this was one of the more exciting Super bowl games to memory.  While, it was a low scoring game, both teams had great defense.  In the end, the Patriots were cocky and just missed immortality by a touchdown. Giants, they had more heart and played like they wanted.  Patriots, from what I saw, and I will admit I am not a football person, didn't have the desire that the Giants had that game.  Especially at the end.  

I also have to say that was an amazing catch by SU alumni and North Jerseyian <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tyree"">David Tyree</a>. I have never seen anyone do a standing back neck bridge over an opponent to catch the ball.  That was amazing. 

Commercials were mediocre this year.  There were a few good ones.  My 2 favorites has to be:
<lj-embed id=""6"" />
because there's fire.  And its funny.  My other favorite is the following one, just because Justin Timberlake gets his ass kicked:
<lj-embed id=""7"" />

There are some honorable mentions, including the Rocky and Godfather parodies and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ray_Bower"">donkey lips</a> getting into a commercial.

"event","I recently heard a keynote speaker discuss <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA"">SCADA systems</a>. SCADA stands for <div style=""display:inline; font-style:italic;"">Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition</div>. These systems are used to perform data collection and control at a supervisors level.  Many different aspects of today's society are controlled by SCADA systems or will be control by SCADA systems.  These include traffic lights, electronic gates, sewage treatment, power generation and other important aspects of society. 

Now, I haven't heard much before in the past about them, but through the presentation I saw that they use of them can be used to cause some problems if these systems are hacked. In general these SCADA hacks are not too widely publicized, but they occur. In many cases, a SCADA system is an old computer system that has been around for years, that now has a new internet connection added to it, without the use of security. For instance, check out this commercial, that was shown to us during the presentation: 
<center><lj-embed id=""4"" /></center>
Sounds like a simple commercial gimmick to entice people through the fear of getting hacked to hire them right?  Well, stuff like this happens in real life.  As soon as I got back from the presentation and went on <a href=""http://www.slashdot.org"">Slashdot</a>, I stumbled across <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/11/tram_hack/"">this article</a> in The Register where a 14 year old boy in Poland modified a TV remote control and created a device that took control of the local tram systems derailing 4 vehicles in the process. As I said before, the people who build this stuff think the system will remain blackbox and no one will interfere with it. Even the article says that:
<center><div style=""display:inline; color:#FF0000;"">Transport command and control systems are commonly designed by engineers with little exposure or knowledge about security using commodity electronics and a little native wit. The apparent ease with which Lodz's tram network was hacked, even by these low standards, is still a bit of an eye opener.</div></center>
Thankfully, no one was killed during this. But others in the future might not be so lucky.  For instance, did you know that the latest models of the Boeing jets are equipped with WiFi that is on the same system as the jets navigational system; and the only thing that is separating them is a Firewall?   Or that a manager of a NJ Lexus dealer arrived one day at 7am to find all the cars in the lot running?

Just a lovely thought to show about how insecure some systems may be. Build security into the initial design to help prevent this stuff and many of these problems will go away."

How are you?,please this is a very private and confidential matter i will like you to tell no one about.I recently made a trip to Africa,Nigeria to be specific.I came on down here to visit a friend of mine but on getting here i misplaced my wallet,and personal documents in which i have my friends full address and telephone number.I also misplaced my atm card which means i have no money on me,I will really appreciate it if you can help me on this matter.
 
Presently i am lodging in an hotel in which the manager is troubling me so much,because i can no longer pay my bills.I will need some loan till i get back,about $2,000us dollars.Can you please help i promise to pay you back as soon as i get back.If you do not have that much,not to worry just tell me how much you can help with.Hope to hear from you as soon as possible.

The e-mail was not signed with her name.  The e-mail fields had the two and from fields with her e-mail in it.  Obviously, this is a Nigerian 419 Scam. What surprised me is that it came from my friend's e-mail address.  I promptly sent her an im about the issue.  It turns out that her account has somehow been compromised.  She believes it might have occurred through the website myheritage.com.  Although she's not entirely certain. She did a virus and ad-aware scan and found nothing significant on her machine. In addition, her password and challenge question have been changed.  Basically, she's lost this address. 

Anyway, I thought I would post this here to give people a heads up.  Careful what you do with your username and password online. It could come back to bite you in the ass."

I mean come on, every time I hear about something she says I just feel my brain wanting to vomit because it doesn't make any sense. I remember a couple years ago, she was paid an insanely overpriced amount of money to talk infront of some college, and her speech message was ""Colleges do not teach American value's therefore all students should drop out of they want to remain American.""

I'm really not sure who's worse at this point. Her or Bill O'Reilly?"

So I make a trip to the post office this morning to drop somethings off. I get there as I hear the clerk and some other employee calling their tech support up about their machines giving them a black screen and disabled features.....I'm not sure I have much more to say than that.

Apparently, there was an article in the Star Ledger that has generated a lot of negative response to the new <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote#Wii_Zapper"">Wii Zapper</a>.  People are saying that it is too realistic for children to use. One person even wrote that they are training 4-9 year old children how to use a gun.

My first question in regards to the parents comment is why are you going to let your kids play the game that trains them to use the gun to begin with? Why are you going to buy it for them?  Why aren't you going to regulate what you kid can play?  Yes, it does look like a a rifle...somewhat, but why is the kid playing a first person shooter that is rated by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESRB"">ESRB</a> to be for teens to adults only.  This isn't the first zapper that ninentdo has created.  
<center><img src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Nes_zapper.jpg' width='500' height='400'/></center>
Beyond me who remembers this classic nintendo controller, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Zapper"">Nintendo Zapper</a>. I used this gun all the time growing up while playing on my nintendo.  I didn't turn into a school shooter. Furthermore, I also used to go rifle and shotgun shooting in the 5-7th grades.  Does that mean I was trained to kill.  No. 

I really hope these overprotective parents that have to force their opinions onto others with violent video games like jack thompson don't ruin it for the regular adults who play these games."

I personally haven't seen the show, but I hear it has done some good.  Now they have attempted to take that concept to the hacker community and get hackers to confess to conducting illegal activities. The result....see for yourself.

Apparently the poor reporter, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Madigan"">Michelle Madigan</a>.  The conference, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON"">Def Con</a> is a place where hackers and federal agents go to trade security ideas in the research field. There is an understanding among attendees that no video or pictures are to be taken without permission.  

Reporters are allowed to have press credentials, but they have a lot more hoops to jump through, to protect privacy of those presenting. She was identified and asked several times before hand if she would like press credentials.  She refused and thought her cover was not blown. If you ask me, she got what she deserved. Screw with hackers/geeks alike, they will mess with you. As seen in the video above, they had fun equating her to the predictors on the dateline show she's a producer for. 

My worry now, which my friend <lj user=""tuxmentat"">, <a href=""http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2007/08/06/lol-dateline-nbc/"">shares with me</a>, is a backlash from the technically-illiterate masses who will just make it harder for security researchers to actually do research legally in the field. There are already bills in congress to make it illegal to attempt to find ways of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_intellectual_property_legislation_pending_in_the_United_States_Congress"">circumventing copyright protections</a> based on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA"">DMCA</a>. With people like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes"">Senator Tubes</a>, running the e-commerce committee, there's a lot to worry about."

So... back to the New Year's resolution. Try to get into bed by 11:30 (managing 1) and up by 9 (managing most days because I&nbsp;have to be somewhere). Yup. I'm spoiled.
Nice day for a lunchtime walk with Jen. Need exercise. Yoga tonight. Trying to work up some excitement.
Realizing I will probably not be in town one single weekend in the entire month of June so I&nbsp;need to get my butt in gear and get some sh*t done already!

Got the jury results from Never Think Small and am not surprised I&nbsp;didn't make the cut. Still, I'm happy to be involved in the gallery.
I think I'm going to stop doing small shows for a bit in order to actually get some work done in advance of Artomatic (which is looking like the end of the year). Also, I haven't been paid by one gallery yet where I&nbsp;sold a $50 piece. So they're not getting any more submissions with hanging fees from me until they pay me. The piece I have in the Arlington library lost its tag. SO I&nbsp;stuck a business card to it. It was a very nice tag. I&nbsp;hope someone took it to contact me later about buying the piece. I'm doubtful.

Also, we're sponsoring a bench in Harris' name in Prospect Park. I&nbsp;think we'll have an acoustic picnic there for his birthday in July. Need to get on some planning.

Ok k12 timesheet time."

Discussion goes like this: You have shit to do. Yeah I know. But I'm cold and I'm not feeling very motivated. You have shit to do. It can wait. You have shit to do. Why? Because you have shit to do now go make some coffee and put on a sweatshirt and stop thinking about going back to bed.<br />Guess that means I'm depressed or something. I don't feel depressed. I just feel unmotivated. I'm quite sure that if I sat down and made a list of reasons to be motivated, I could get my head around that and I'd be a better friend and a better person. If I put myself on a schedule, I might have some follow-through. But I'm spoiled and lazy and making excuses to move very slowly.<br />I just talked myself into going though some motions. <br />I couldn't fall asleep until late last night so I used it as an excuse to not get up at 8:30 to go to yoga. There was my first mistake. I woke up at 9 so I totally could have done it. Got up, showered, went to the pet store and got Char a new collar so he could go out. Come home, ate cereal and made coffee.<br />Looking at the rest of the paperwork on the floor from Friday that needs finishing. Contemplating re-writing to-do lists (one for life one for work - and by work I mean MY work, not k12).<br />Decided to putter around on Facebook and then write this post.<br />Perhaps putting the self-criticism out in the ether will get me motivated.<br />Bill will get home soon -he's been out since dinnertime yesterday. Bill will make me motivated (see how I suck?)<br />oy.<br />Ok moving on.<br /><br />p.s. It would help if I could put my contacts in. My contacts make my eyes feel cold and wakes me up in the morning. But I&nbsp;have an infected oil gland in my eyelid and while I have a cream antibiotic in my left eye, I&nbsp;have to wear my glasses. So that's another thing making me unfocused and another excuse I have. <br /></lj-cut>"

"event","This is (apologetically) a cross-post from Facebook:

Too often we self-define by our dayjobs. Can you describe yourself without really telling what you DO but, rather, what you ARE?

I'm going to take my own challenge: 
I'm a dreamer and a pessimist. I make stuff, whether it's art, dinner, music, clothes or pies. Oddly, I have never felt strongly about procreating. I often prefer the end result to the creation process, unless it's something kind of zen - like chopping vegetables - because I'm also slightly obsessive. I am better at being organized than sloppy, though sometimes it's hard to tell. I'm a spiritual person, participate in a religion, am very socially liberal but prefer old-fashioned manners. I absorb sensory influences like a sponge (travel, museums, cheeses, songs). I dip myself in, but sometimes it gets overwhelming because I'm almost always influenced by something to make me want to learn more or I start dreaming and there's never enough time."

So far this has just been a wonderful experience for me. You pay $99, you get an 8' x 8' bit of plywood. Now go strut your stuff. I haven't been this hands-on in an awfully long time and it felt damned good! I was finishing my art up until Monday night. Load-in closed Tuesday night. While I was downtown, some other artists who'd finished early came by to look and talk. It is actually really new to me to have folks think I'm cool because they think my art is cool. Usually I'm that person with all my kick ass artistic and musician friends. I'm looking forward to the next few weeks. This is the first time I've put up anything I can call &quot;art&quot; for public display. And they're expecting 70k people! Yeek.  We'll see if this project has any legs!

"event","<lj-cut text=""Behind the cut as it turned out to be kind of long..."">Last night I was watching a tv show about &quot;who was the historical Jesus&quot; and I'm not sure if the show is accurate or slightly Christian-slanted but it did raise some interesting questions about Jews living in the last days of the Temple.<br /><br />Where did John the Baptist (who I call &quot;John the mikvah guy&quot;) come up with the idea of one bath cleansing one of all their sins? It seems that in context John would have been a bit of a crackpot. But it would also seem that people were a lot more open minded to crackpots back then. Also that there were a LOT of splinter groups at the time so I suppose John was not that out of the ordinary. <br /><br />Obviously John got the main idea from the mikvah cleansing impurities but how did that translate to a lifelong absolution of sin? Is there some overlap in his ideas with the celebration of Yom Kippur because he wanted to provide an alternative to Jews from HAVING to go to the temple? Apparently most of the Jews were poor and it was a struggle to raise money to pay mikvah men and the priests at the Temple, nevermind about Roman taxes and Temple tithing! It would seem obvious John was a hippie and decided Jews could absolve themselves of their sins without the help of the priests at the Temple. I wonder how Jews in Temple times even celebrated Yom Kippur? But it does seem John is a direct result of the POLITICS of the time rather than so much about inventing a new religion. Problem is those two concepts are very much intertwined 2000 years ago.<br /><br />But when Jesus picked up John's followers, where did he get the idea to start speaking of and even emphasizing the world to come and the idea of people going to heaven? I thought that Jews were not supposed to overly concern ourselves with these in the world of the present. Supposedly Jesus was well-versed in study and would have known this. Or were beliefs THAT different for Jews 2000 years ago? I also thought that our tradition does not believe that people go to heaven, but that heaven is a place for g-d and angels to live? Unless Jesus considered that a soul returning to g-d would go to the place where g-d lived...<br /><br />Except that this tv show said that the Jews of the time believed that g-d lived in the holy of holies in the temple. So again, this leads back to the idea of creating a break from the Temple.<br /><br />Were these early teachings of John and Jesus MAINLY a political counter to the Temple altogether? My thinking is that YES, they were. It would seem that a lot of what Jesus and later, the gospel writers did was deliberately calculated. Why place Jesus birth in Bethlehem when it was most likely in the Galilee (is there historical proof of that census requiring mass migrations?)? but either way, Jesus knew that he SHOULD enter Jerusalem the way he did. He was making a point.<br /><br />It seems this alternative Judaism which has become Christianity is a religion that is deeply rooted in politics right from the beginning.<br /><br />But the political climate seemed rife with alternatives and crackpots. Do you know anything about the other historical miracle men that get mention, like Honi HaM'agel (mentioned in this tv show)? I think this requires more research for me. Lets just say that I believe Monty Python's Life of Brian is not very far off the mark from the reality of the times.<br /><br />With that in mind,&nbsp; perhaps modern Judaism (post Temple) is the original brainchild of Rabbi Akiva (also martyred for his beliefs and teachings) in the same way that Christianity evolved from the teachings of Jesus? Either way, the early Christians and Talmudic Jews had some serious overlaps in their growth in the first couple hundred years post-Temple.<br /><br />Just some thoughts on the season.</lj-cut>"

"event","I&nbsp;know I&nbsp;haven't posted in a while. I'm still ridiculously busy. I'd thought I'd have some more free time over the holidays as I&nbsp;usually do (my work gives us a couple extra days off) but sadly, no. Anyway, here's a personal post for a change.<br /><br />Thanksgiving came out pretty well. I'd coordinated the majority of the food and earned some more points towards my bubbie-training. I LOOK&nbsp;like one in the photos my mom and aunt took of me with my arms slid up under the turkey skin. Homer was a 21 pound fresh killed happy life turkey that we ordered from a farm in PA. One of the woman from a local slow foods coop organized the drop. He came missing a wing for some reason - we dubbed him a left-wing turkey - but he cooked deliciously. Everyone came in to DC from all over and my aunt and uncle hosted for the weekend (my house is just not big enough for 23 people).<br /><br />And it was all downhill into the holidays. December went by pretty quickly. We got one nice night of dinner and at-home caroling with Tara and <lj user=""fr_defenestrato"">, and I&nbsp;had a night out of gingerbread house building with Jaime and her sister. I bought a gingerbread train kit which I&nbsp;only realized was morbid for me partway through building it. Jaime had some lovely skull and bones candy and I decorated the front of the train with those. I&nbsp;think Harris would have approved.&nbsp; <br /> <br /><lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;and I&nbsp;went up to NY so he could have his deviated septum corrected as well as a UPP to correct his snoring. Both went really well and he was back to work the following Monday. I wasn't able to see anyone while we were in NY as I&nbsp;was playing nurse when I didn't have to work (remotely from my aunt's dining room). I had wanted to visit Lara and her new baby and Dawn and Carson and theirs but the visits will have to wait (as I&nbsp;was also getting over a sinus infection of my own and didn't want to pollute anyone else - luckilly <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp; didn't get it either!)It was so frigid and dry in my aunt's house that we decided to come home early. The less said about that the better, and <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;recouperated at home over the weekend.<br /><br />But IT WORKED!!!&nbsp; <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;no longer snores (just makes quitetish little snuffling noises every so often) but better than that, HE CAN BREATHE! He had no idea that he hadn't really been breathing these past 20- 30 years. He's getting a more restful nights sleep and actually waking up in the morning without the need of provigil. He even woke up and bleached the bathroom shower Wednesday morning, which was not very plesant for me as I'd wanted to sleep a little longer. Hard to sleep through the smell of bleach but what the hey.<br /><br />Anyway, that weekend I decided to make gingerbread box presents for my department's cookie exchange. They took 4 days to complete but I'm pretty happy with them. I'll try and post the photos later. I hope people actually ATE&nbsp;them as I&nbsp;deliberately didn't over ice or candy them so they COULD&nbsp;be eaten.<br /><br />We went out to <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;'s parent's house for Christmas. His step grandfather, Bob,&nbsp; had been diagnosed with metastatic liver cancer back in October and we'd stopped by to see him and <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;'s grandmother, Juanita, on the way back from Harris' memorial up in NYC. Partway through December Bob's kids convinced him to put Juanita into a nursing home temporarilly so he could get some rest as she'd refused to accept he was dying and kept on making him do errands and drive her to HER appointments as usual while on morphine and chemotherapy. So it was accepted that Bob would spend Christmas with his family and <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;'s parents left Juanita in the home (2 hours drive from them) over the holidays.<br /><br />Christmas morning we got a call from one of Bob's sons that he had passed sometime between Christmas eve and morning and they were arranging the funeral. <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;convinced his dad to go look at a nursing home near them so they could move Juanita down. We also had to convince my FIL&nbsp;to tell her that Bob had died and that Juanita really did have to go to the funeral. After that weekend, it became clear that my FIL&nbsp;doesn't like his mother at all and doesn't really want to deal with this. Problem is, there's no other family to do it (except <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;and me). My FIL&nbsp;finally put down the deposit on the home last week. My biggest concern is that my in-laws are insisting on locking Juanita up in the dementia ward and she's NOT demented. She's slightly senile and forgetful but she really is almost all there. She always DID rewrite history, apparently, there shoul dbe nothing new there. She didn't forget Bob was dying, she deliberately ignored the fact in the hopes that she and Jesus could will it not to happen (you see she married a man 15 years her junior so he could look after her. She is 88 now).<br /><br />This past Monday night, we drove up to Newark, DE for the funeral which was Tuesday at noon. We'd intended to try and get Juanita some clothes to wear for it. She didn't have a single decent thing to wear. She'd been wearing sweat pants and sweaters since forever and that's all she owned. It didn't matter anyway since we met <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;'s folks the next day and picked Juanita up at the home. She insisted we were going to be late and didn't want to change clothes. Honestly she was wearing the best thing we could have picked out for her anyway, though we were able to bring her a black coat.<br /><br />The funeral was nice and Methodist. <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;found it a bit agonizing. I didn't mind. Bob was buried in the churchyard. Junatia didn't seem to want much to do with my in-laws nor they with her so they left <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;and I to look after her. My in-laws were CONVINCED&nbsp;she would think she was going home after the funeral but she knew she wasn't. I didn't have to do more than reaffirm that. The problem was that nobody would tell her how long she'd have to stay on the demtia ward in Newark. I ended up telling her she'd have to stay a couple more weeks. But nobody told her what she's doing next. She's used to calling the shots and she's not going to like this. She said to me that she's just going to have to get married again. I said to her &quot;Haven't you seen Driving Miss Daisy?&quot; - she thought that was funny.<br /><br />Nothing has been done about the house since. Not like my in-laws are retired or anything and have nothing better to do than start boxing up the packrat estate! I&nbsp;made a list of furniture I thought Juanita may need in the new home. Hopefully <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;can convince her to tell him what she really must have with her. I'm afraid she's going to stay in denial, or continue to be angry with <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;'s folks, or lose her mind in the ward the next couple weeks. I guess the less I&nbsp;say on this now the better, I've already said enough.<br /><br />So Wednesday I&nbsp;was REALLY&nbsp;glad we decided not to have our new year's party this year as we simply hadn't been home! I worked from home Wednesday so the electrician could come and repair the outlet we'd accidentally blown up. There was a giant windstorm that knocked a 20 foot long branch out of our tree. I photographed it and made a request to the HOA to have the tree removed as it's been dropping branches for years and is going to continue to do so and is a safety hazzard. I think we're in for a fight (and no&nbsp;we can't just cut it down as Reston is with trees the way the anti-abortionists are with fetuses). <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;took the electric chainsaw to it when he got home so it would no longer block the path.<br /><br />Wednesday night, we went down to the Korean spa in Centreville for the first time. I AM SO GOING BACK THERE FOR MY BIRTHDAY! I'd been wanting to check it out for ages. We got massages and played in the jet pools and hot tubs (segregated locker rooms, bathing suits not permitted), and all the mineral dry saunas and the relaxation, socialization room (they provide you with shorts and a top - color coded - women are orange, men are yellow). I&nbsp;had a nice red bean shaved ice thing that was pretty good. <lj user=""jaegerbeast"">&nbsp;says we washed away 2008... and then we burned it away with fire. As we got home just before midnight, we heard the fire trucks outside at midnight. Somehow a brush fire had started just up the street. The firemen had it out really fast. I&nbsp;was very glad we hadn't shot off fireworks so nobody could blame us!<br /><br />Had some sparkling viognier and watched the first part of &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; before turning in close to 3am. <br /><br />Happy 2009!<br /><br />"

And while he clearly has no following among his fellow West Bank settlers, he has many acquaintances in the Israeli establishment and has direct access to several leaders, including President Shimon Peres and senior figures in the Defense Ministry.</em><br /><br /><em>But the letter he sent to several of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s policy advisers in late November outlining his proposal was co-signed by Gershon Baskin and Hanna Siniora, the Israeli and Palestinian executive officers of Ipcri, the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information, one of the most established nongovernmental peace institutes in the land.</em><br /><br /><em>A settlement of about 250 families just south of Jerusalem, Tekoa has a reputation of being relaxed, with a mixed population of religious and non-religious Jews. It is in the shadow of the flat-topped hill of the Herodion, a fortress cum palace built by Herod the Great.</em> (NOTE: less crazy settlers)<br /><br /><em>He mentioned that one of his 10 children lived in the desert canyon behind the settlement, in a cave. Another built a stone house with his own hands in Tekoa D, an unauthorized outpost of the settlement slated for removal.</em><br /><p><em>As such, the settler rabbi&rsquo;s vision of peace does not conform to the standard one of the past 20 years, involving the creation of a Palestinian state in a settlement-free West Bank and Gaza, with its capital in East Jerusalem. </em></p><p><em>He said he would refuse to leave his home in the case of such a deal. The government &ldquo;has no right to uproot people from their homes,&rdquo; he said.</em></p><p><em>Instead, because the Jews and Arabs are &ldquo;so mixed up,&rdquo; Rabbi Froman proposed the establishment of two countries without borders, or two states in one land.</em>  (NOTE:&nbsp;Another example why this is complicated. This Rabbi believes that Israel SHOULD leave the settlers in the West Bank under Palestinian rule. OK maybe it COULD work - except for those nail-studded potatoes in my previous post)<br /><br />Considering THE&nbsp;reason the Palestinians historically kept refusing the two state solution, and even the one state solution under Palestinian rule before the end of the British Mandate seems to be the condition that they allow Jews to continue to live on the land, I'd be very surprised if this Rabbi could get everyone to actually agree. Hell maybe this guy is the messiah. who knows?</p><br />"

One could ask, &quot;why not just leave the settlers out there under Palestinian rule?&quot; Well, the answer seems to be that if Israel DID&nbsp;that, they'd be giving the Palestinians a state as riddled with terrorists (of the Jewish vareity) as Israel currently deals with (of the Arab variety). <br /><br />It's complicated.<br /><br /><strong>My highlights from this article (if you don't want to read it):</strong><br /><em>After more than 200 settlers were hauled away from the cavernous four-story building by security forces using stun grenades and tear gas, dozens of settler youths fanned out across Hebron attacking Palestinians and setting olive groves ablaze. One settler shot two Palestinians outside their family home. <br /><br />The footage was broadcast by Israeli TV stations.</em><br /><br /><em>The notion of exacting a price for evacuation of settlers in the West Bank is the cornerstone of a new policy by some radical Jewish settlers to spread mayhem in response to any eviction attempt by the Israeli authorities. Dubbed &ldquo;price tag,&rdquo; the policy aims to spread thin and exhaust Israeli security forces.</em><br /><em><br />At stake is nothing less than the future of the West Bank, Israel and the Palestinian state, settlers say, with some determined to oppose any Jewish withdrawal from the holy land -- by force, if necessary.</em><br /><em><br />Inside the house, called Peace House by the settlers, police uncovered a stockpile of blocks, bricks, potatoes spiked with long nails, and containers of acid and turpentine. Caught by surprise, the evacuees didn't have time to use much of their arsenal.</em><br /><br /><em>Settlers say the house belongs to a Jewish buyer who purchased it for $1 million, and claim to have the documentation to prove it. But the Palestinian who sold the house to its Jewish owner -- Morris Abraham, a New York businessman -- says he reneged on the deal once he learned the buyer was Jewish. Israeli police say the settlers' sales contract is forged.</em><br /><em><br />Israel's High Court of Justice ruled that the settlers should leave the house until the question of forgery can be sorted out, and this week Defense Minister Ehud Barak ordered an immediate eviction.</em><br /><br /><strong>And some interesting reader's comments:</strong><br /><em>The High Court DID NOT rule that an immediate evacuation must take place.&nbsp; It ruled that it COULD take place.&nbsp; There is a big difference.&nbsp; Once more the courts have worked with the government to give a legal cloak to political decisions.&nbsp; The evacuation could have waited for the lower court to decide if the ownership belongs to the Jews who purchased the house.&nbsp; One must remember that it is a capital offense under PA law to sell property to a Jew and this is why the Arab insists that no sale took place. </em><br /><br /><em>It appears that certain Jewish community in Israel have limited rights, and certainly the law of the land is not respecting this pious community.&nbsp; The army should have waited until the lower court ruled on who owned the house. I guess it is okay that the Arab community could live with no fear among the Jewish community, but the Jews cannot live safely among the Arab community.&nbsp; I guess terrorism and bad behavior is very effective.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>The settlers and their supporters would destroy the Jewish state if they could. They have no right to defy the Israeli government&rsquo;s demand that they leave a building that they illegally occupied in the midst of Hebron. The settlers goad Arab residents of Hebron into nasty confrontations that the sensible &amp; responsible leadership of Israel does not want. I&rsquo;m on the side of Israeli law and order. The settlers have become terrorists and they should be treated like the criminals they are. </em><br /><br /><em>I am surprised that the settlers can be forcefully ejected from that house when the issue of the ownership of the house has not been determined. The documents alleged to be forged have not been entirely proven to be so. The issue of ownership of the house is still to be determined and a nation hastily threw its people out! So what happens if indeed the house is found to rightly belong to the Jewish businessman? You call back the ejectees? Where are those ejectees living now? Are they happy in the new place? Israel appears to me to be too frenetic to give away every thing for peace; is this &lsquo;peace&rsquo; worth it?</em><br /><br />"

Book Update...  
4 more pages left to draw and then I have to color all 33 of them. Still haven't done the endpapers - I'm saving that bit for last.

ok I've got 12 pages completely finished now, 16 with the pencil line touched up and all sky and main characters colored (I call this stage partial color), 5 rough scans still left to be touched up before coloring. Still no endpapers.
 
I'm REALLY trying to finish before Christmas but not tremendously hopeful. Discovering that illustrating a 42 page children's book and having a dayjob, something resembling a life plus ongoing family tsuris are pretty mutually exclusive."

"event","Ok so I got a lot of silly looks. I'm used to that. Why did I&nbsp;put up that last post? Couple of reasons. Pardon the half-brained ramble, I'm hoping this is going to make sense.<br /><br />I was thinking about art. Music, Visual Arts, Writing. The standard expressive media forms. In the last 15 years fashion and cuisine have also entered the accepted expressive artistic media definitions as well. One could argue that fashion has always been an expressive art form, but because clothing's also a necessity, it seems to have always fallen into the category of &quot;decorative arts&quot;&nbsp;more than something one would put in a fine art museum. And though food has also always historically been used as a decorative art (medieval feasting, pageantry, or just go see that Marie Antoinette movie), the mixing of &quot;colors&quot; on the taste bud palette as an art form seems to be a fairly new practice.<br /><br />Unlike the &quot;fine arts&quot;, food and clothing are necessities. Now it could be argued that &quot;<span class=""hw"">Man cannot live by bread alone,</span>&quot; but much as I agree with it, I'm not going there right now (feel free, keeping in mind that &quot;by bread alone&quot; still relegates food to the realm of the mundane). Anyway, as necessities, food and clothing are artistically expressive of nothing. It's interesting to think about clothing/fashion and food as an expressive medium for artistic output. <br /><br />Both Tim Gunn and Anthony Bourdain can be held up as representative of the luxury we have in our culture to be able to make art in the media of necessities. <br />Or something else.<br />I think that Gunn and Bourdain's presence in the media (even though a lot of you have obviously never heard of either of them) indicates that the general American IS able to conceive of these as artistic media. <br /><br />However, as much as one would assume that these two are icons of snootiness, haute cuisine and couture, their own words and actions belie this. As much as they both explore the rise of new mediums in art, they both are very well aware of the &quot;necessity&quot; status of food and clothing. <br /><br />Gunn says:<strong> </strong>&quot;Part of it, too, is just a natural inclination of mankind and other species to have a nest in which you feel comfortable, a nest you feel is a safe haven. It's nothing if not deeply, deeply personal. And this is why, when I walk into the home of someone I'm only meeting for the first time, not only am I looking at them and their manner of presentation, I'm looking at how they live. Because just as our clothes send a message about how we want to be perceived, the environments in which we live send a message about how we want to be perceived. &quot;<br /><br />And in his Spain episode, Bourdain actually compares and contrasts the high modern art (nouvelle cuisine and molecular gastronomy) of El Bulli, and the sun-created chocolate art of Enric Rovira, with classic tapas and comfort foods in a way that I can only compare with juxtaposing John cage and Klezmer music (the way my brother did).<br /><br />Though you could argue that &quot;high modernism&quot; OR &quot;comfort&quot; is the goal in the expression of art in these mediums as well as in Kandinsky and Grandma Moses, Melville and fireside tales, the presence of Bourdain and Gunn on MY&nbsp;radar means the elevation of these mediums for artistic expression above their accepted status as folk art.<br /><br />Hence, &quot;discuss.&quot;<br /><br />"

We closed up Harris' apartment this past weekend. Then Lea, his girlfriend, Mark, Madam J and I went for pizza at Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge. Last time I was there, Harris took me for lunch before he moved to Los Angeles. We talked about his being depressed and on medication for the first time. Little did I know that was really the beginning of this madness. It was a beautiful night so we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan and back again - something I'd never done but had always wanted to do. I stopped in the middle to lie down and peer through the boards at the ""waterfall"" beneath the bridge (this is a current art installation in NY harbor). All the windows in Manhattan were watching. 

All of Harris' things that matter to me are in my house now and I have a huge project ahead to make sense of them. I've started digitizing his audio tapes. I'm going to link up a blog so people can help me figure out some of what I'm finding. Things like who were the members of the Klezmer All-Stars and why didn't I know about the incidental music he wrote for two theatrical projects until tonight? There's a lot to get through.

We have a date for the memorial in NYC - the weekend of October 18/19. There will be an e-blast to various groups for more information and in case folks want to participate. 

And I still have my own work to finish - my children's book is long overdue. Being depressed for 4 months didn't help, there... And there is a study that is coming out linking my now previous asthma medication to suicidal thoughts. How wonderful. I switched off that drug a few weeks ago. Hard to tell if it made an impact on my mood (there's a weak attempt at humor).

But in the life must go on department, Jaegerbeast and I booked Labor Day week in Bermuda. 
I've been wanting to go back to Bermuda for 21 years. We had taken the week off months ago but hadn't settled on a destination. We had been leaning towards Bermuda but when Mark and Madam J mentioned on Saturday that they were going to Bermuda Labor Day weekend, we were sold. 

When I was there as a teen-ager, we stayed in this lovely colonial style hotel that had paper models of grand English Victorian estates in the lobby case-windows. I had just read Jane Eyre so I was very enamored with them, and I replaced Jamaica in my mind with Bermuda..."

"event","Since I have neither the time nor the technology (yet) to start posting Harris' music, I make a mini mix tape with some help from youtube and rhapsody to share:

<lj-cut text=""a mix tape"">
<lj-embed id=""13""/>
<br />
Harris humored me with the Stu Hamm version of Linus and Lucy, pretty much whenever I asked him to. We were like those peanuts kids when we were little but he really grew up into Schroeder.

<hr>

<lj-embed id=""14""/><br />Harris introduced me to Tuck and Patti's beautiful cover. I still love Cindi Lauper's original but this duo introduced a new flavor of soul to it.

<hr>

<lj-embed id=""15""/><br />Harris introduced me to Tom Waits. His friends are right, he did a really good impression of the gravely voice. He also was fascinated by the punctuation of the chorus. Was it about time that you fall in love? Or was it just that you were in love with time?

<hr>

<lj-embed id=""16""/><br />Through his interest in bluegrass, Harris discovered the Telluride Sessions, Strength in Numbers. For one of the Harris n Dave concerts when he was in High School, he wrote down all the parts of this beautiful piece and had us play it live. He taught himself to play a dobro in order to perform it.

<hr>

<lj-embed id=""17""/><br />Harris' love of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel (especially Bookends) was a tribute to his love for David Sollors, who was really more of a brother to him than just a friend.

<hr>

<lj-embed id=""18""/><br />I think so many of will never hear this song the same way again. This song always broke me up before. He almost got me into trouble dedicating a performance of it to me.

<hr>

<lj-embed id=""19""/><br />Long before Harris met Ruth Unger, there was the PBS documentary of the Civil War. Harris and I would play this piece together and after a while it was just so sad that we had to take it up a notch and shmaltz it up until we were giggling with the fake sentimentality we had just created. That said, we always appreciated the spirit of the tune (as Jay Unger describes here).

<hr>

There is no Youtube for this one so you'll have to link through:
http://play.rhapsody.com/planxty/coldblowandtherainynight/polkasdennismurphyspolkathe42poundchequejohnryanspolka?didAutoplayBounce=true
Harris came back from Ireland with this CD. He taught himself and then me these reels. It appears that most folks who know ""Dennis Murphy's Polka"" play it only with ""John Ryan's"" but because of this, it always sounds empty to me without ""The 42 Pound Cheque"" in the middle.

<hr>

<lj-embed id=""20""/>
<br />I'll end this mini ""mix tape"" with one of the songs that started it all. Picture little Harris and Little Dave, aged about 11 or 12 performing this song in a tiny talent show in the middle school chorus room. I believe Dave could only play the auto harp back then, and Harris had my grandfather's mandolin. Yes really.

Bailey and I have been goin to see bands play lately.  Its so much fun, I love it.  Its funny that I'm finally getting into the music scene of Denver and I'm about to leave.  Oh well.  I can't wait to be done with school!  I've just about got all my work done... minus my ""defense papers"".  god rmsel is such a bitch.  but this next month is gunna get pretty busy.  Play performance, prom, the fray concert, portfolio sign off, sand dunes trip (with just the seniors hehe), graduation, and moving.  Im excited to spend the summer in Crested Butte.  I think I'll have way more fun there than here.  Even tho theres less to do lol.  Lots of camping and drinking tho :).  And then I'm off to Concordia in the fucking freezing north of Minnesota.  Oh well... it'll be fun?

"event","well nationals has come and (just about) gone.  today are the championship games which should be awesome.  even though my team got killed in our games it was still really fun.  Most of those girls will prolly never have the chance to go to nationals again.  and it really is an amazing experience.  It was almost an honor just being on the same sheet of ice as some of those girls.  our aaa teams did really well too.  the 16s made it to the final four but lost 1-0 (really exciting).  then the 19s lost 4-3 which was even more exciting.  they were down 3-0 but tied it up in the last period only to lose with 55 seconds left in the game.  Probably the best thing I got out of this tournament was an offer to play for Concordia up in Minnesota.  I'd been in contact with the coach and she said she'd come watch me this week.  I guess she talked to my coach for like three hours lol.  hes such a friendly old man.  anyway im not totally sure if i wanna go there tho.  ive narrowed down my college choices to concordia and ubc.  but it all comes down to wether or not i wanna play D3 hockey.  I honestly didn't think Id have the option to play college hockey.  I mean that's what I've always wanted but in the past couple years I started to doubt it.  of course id prolly be riding the bench most of my first year but that'd be ok with me.  ugh i dunno tho!  I really wanted to go to ubc... decisions decisions.

It's the last time ill ever get to play with any of those kids (cept for the ones on my nationals team).  But i'll still never get to play with that team again.  and what makes me sad too is that none of my other friends are gunna come watch our games.  They'll never get to see me play again!  Never!!  And all my teachers used to be like, ""we wanna come watch you play!""... but really that translates to ""thats nice that you play hockey but i dont care... where's the free teacher food?""  Thats right rmsel teachers have ADD too.  Fuckin steve lost me and hailee's math papers!!  I HATE RMSEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyway, hockey is great.  Almost as great as my crunkin aunt lynda.

Too bad they kept me up all night tho.  Then this morning i went to the st. patricks day parade with my momma cus bailey and her team went to breakfast and pretty much ditched me... bastards.  but anyway it was fun.  colleen was singing!  she was so good.  i wish i coulda gone and hung out with her and had some beer but i was with the mother.  and also i have to go to hockey practice in a little bit here.  Heeey i just remembered we still have shit load of alcohol left.  cant drink 2nite tho cus i have late practice then an early one.  fuckin hockey... im gunna miss it so much but i still have to complain about its interference with valuable drunk time.  welp i better go.  parcheesy.

I really think that if everyone stays focused we can totally upset that tournament... even with only 10 skaters.  and i think im gunna have some crested buttian friends come up too which would be really great.  anyway i gotta go get ready for battle of the bands...

"event","well hockey just keeps making me feel more shitty.  yesterday i had a big falling out with my coach.  during the game.  i was so angry at him that all this stuff just kept coming out of my mouth.  but then he said some really mean things to me.  i was pretty shocked... and hurt.  and i cant ever look at him the same way.  it really hurts when someone u used to respect so much turns around and makes a coment about ur life being a shit hole.  especially cus he doesnt know anything about my life.  i couldnt believe he would say something like that.  he appologized to me 2day during our game but he wont just talk to me.  we talked about it in the locker room too... which led to a lot of yelling.  i dont like when tom yells.  and i was also pissed about our game today.  i totally let this girl score on us.  i felt so stupid... and angry.  anyway last night i had fun tho.  i went to c.springs with my mom to go to her friends house for dinner.  her son is also an old old friend of mine.  we've known eachother since we were born.  i love that kid.  hes too funny.  but that was fun.  it was the one fun thing about my weekend.  and tomorrow is death day... aka valentines day.  i think ill do nothing.  o shit i need to get my mom a birthday present!  i dont think id like to have my birthday on valentines day.  pffff... need a shower.

"event","Tom has changed a lot.  He's not the coach he used to be.  And it makes me really sad.  I mean... he used to care.  I mean really care.  Sure he cares, he wouldnt show up to practice if he didnt.  But he stopped believing in us a long time ago.  Its like we're a waste of time.  We're no longer ""AAA prospects"" but simply the AA who everyone looks at as a rec team.  Yup, thats us.  Its kind of hard to respect someone who just yells at you all the time.  I mean I still respect Tom... but now its on a different level.  Maybe he just has some intense home life issues... but still he should believe in his team.  And its not about ""us"", or ""our"" time anymore... its about ""my time"" and ""my way"".  Its weird to think about how Tom used to be like a father figure to me.  Now he's just my angry coach who seems to hate coming to practice.  I used to talk to him and ask him questions.  Now we have a strictly player-coach relationship.  I think I need to talk to him though... I'm not the only one who feels like this right guys (teammate directed)?  Remember when he used to show up to games an hour ahead just like we have to?  Because he cared?  It makes me sad.  I guess even 40 year old men can still change... just like everyone else.

On a good note i went snowboarding today with schewl and it was way fun... too bad my day had to end on a bad note.

I saw the aviator (which i really didnt like), lemony snicket (i enjoyed it), the grudge (kinda stupid), ray (very good), finding neverland (so good), in good company (alright), and hotel rwanda which was amazing.  it was really sad and depressing but it was soo good.  well im gunna go do some stuff... peace.

On New Years I chilled with some old friends, got pretty drunk and then went up to this party on the mountain with jarrod and dan.  it was like THEE party to be at.  SO much fun.  I saw soo many people.  and there was shit loads of alcohol... MmMmm.  It was in this hotel room up at the lodge... that place got so trashed.  there were like 3 bottles of champagne sprayed all over the place (I hid/fell into the closet to avoid getting soaked lol).  and jarrod and mary rolled off the bed into this broken table haha man.  i guess after we left, the hotel called the cops and jarrods older brother and his friends got charged a shit load of money for damages.  but it was a damn good party.  drunk crested buttians are the best.  hah when we were riding the bus down from the mountain everyone was dancin, even the bus driver.  and dan made out with some old lady haha.  but then my night got even better cus me and jarrod... well we had some good times.  it was weird how it felt like we had been together for so long.  i dunno we just like clicked so good.  i hung out with jarrod and dan again last night.  and some other kids too.  i was really sad to leave.  it sux that jarrod and i live so far apart.  but now i have an excuse to go visit more lol.  god i hate denver more and more every day.  well im gunna go unpack my shit.

"event","Well I have a pretty awesome christmas so far.  This whole trip to CB has been the best EVER.  Thursday night i went and saw Footloose with all my family (the musical).  my friend katie was in it so i got to see her.  it was a fun show.  bailey and i cracked up the whole time at her friend john who was in it.  man we had some good laughs.  but then after the show some kids showed up and my old friend jarrod was like 'come hang out with us'.  so i did and it was so much fun.  i forgot that there were actually some cool people in cb that i do like to hang out with.  and there was nothing awkward about it.  i mean usually im all uncomfortable around cb kids cus i like dont know them anymore... but hand me a beer and im just fine.  then yesterday i went ice skating.  i had the whole rink to myself which is always fun.  i forgot how much fun it is to play on an open outdoor rink with a beautiful view all around you.  then last night... too much fun.  bailey and i brought some rum up from denver and so we snuck out to the car a couple times.  but then i asked my cousin jackson (25) if he'd get me a drink and he was like sure!  so we all got drunk and had hilarious times.  i got to see peter who i havnt seen in forever.  and katie and maddie came by.  and zach was there... man that kid is smart/awesome to the max.  and we all sat around and laughed and had good times.  i didnt get anything super great for christmas tho.  we got a fooseball table which is awesome tho.  i got some cds, new purse, sweater and sweatshirt, a nice lamp... haha o man i think my favorite was the flashlight my grandma gave me.  i had to work hard to keep from laughing when i saw that that was what she got us for christmas.  hah o well.  um also my moms boyfriend showed up today while we were all doing the Petito family christmas show at the radio station.  he was all ""surprise!""  it was weird.  but my moms happy so i cant complain.  and mary barbour is in town!  we used to be like best friends back in the day.  i think im gunna see her tonight.  or maybe tomorrow if i dont leave.  i might go home monday by myself cus mom can go home with mark tomorrow.  we'll see.

"event","Being in Crested Butte for Christmas has made me pretty nostalgic.  I havn't been here for christmas since we moved.  lately ive been thinking about how much i miss it here.  i really hate how crowded the city is.  theres too many people.  i hate that i cant walk into the video store and rent a movie without a card.  and i hate that i cant go downtown and enjoy a play without spending 20 mins looking for a parking place and then have to pay 10 bucks to do so.  i miss knowing people.  i dont know anyone in denver.  everyone seems so fake.  i guess im not one to talk about that cus i know i come off as pretty fake most of the time.  which i guess only the few people who know me well would pick up on.  i think im pretty good at the fake smile.  which kinda scares me cus i do it so subconciously.  i wish i would just be myself always.  but that seems to be impossible.  im so sick of the world and everyone in it.  i wanna move to some secluded island where i can live a quiet and peacefull life.  and i am so completely terrified of going to college.  just thinking about it makes me cry.  it seems like my whole life has been a quest to find happiness and acceptance and ive come up empty handed wherever i go.  i dont wanna have to start over.  i seriously dont think i can do it.  my mental state is so broken right now that im afraid of what i might do to myself.  maybe i need help.  Well... Merry Christmas.

"event","this is what i did this weekend...

Saturday...
8 AM: woke up, drove to the edge.
9:30-10:30: practice with Wolf Pack
Home for an hour
12:45: Drove to Edge for hockey game (with my AA team) vs. Gunnison... which we won 9-0 (i had a goal and 2 assists).  Also kierra rossman who i grew up with plays for gunnison... weird.  also hannah engles who i took skating lessons with when i was little. crazy.  and they really were not good.  it made me remember how i used to be at that level... and i moved to denver so i could play hockey all the time and be awesome and be the best and play in college.  funny how somewhere along the line i lost my ambition for hockey.  hah really i just stopped caring about EVERYthing
3:45- drove to co. springs for an hour and half long practice with wolf pack.
6:45- left practice 15 mins early cus i told my coach i wanted to see my friend who was back from the army... but he went to grand junction with all my former friends who didnt tell me they were leaving... like i said, former friends.  i also could have gone to zack's bday party but that was in golden and i just wasnt up for the drive.
8:30- drove to matt's to get chris and was reminded how hot matt is and how bad it sux that i dont talk to him anymore...pffff
10-11:30- watched The Beach and thought about how awesome it would be if i could go on an adventure to find a secret island where this small community lived in paradise and smoked pot all the time.  and where there was no big city or fuck face people and it was peaceful and simple and good.
11:30- stopped fighting my exhaustion and went to bed.
Sunday...
5:15 AM: woke up
5:35- woke up again and realized i should have been leaving for the edge by now
7- played gunnison again and won 5-0 (i think).  i had another assist.  also watched kierra (the one i grew up with) get taken away in an ambulance because of a concussion... her 3rd (or 4th?) this month.
8:15 had practice with the wolf pack
9:45- went to breakfast with the WP team at IHOP where we exchanged secret santa gifts and i tried to keep conversation with hannah prang in order to avoid talking to jill who was sitting across from me... so annoying.
11:30- had dryland training at foothills
12:45- had practice.. also schrimaged the 16 wp who beat us once again even though we were in their zone like 75% of the time.  Also thought about how jule and co. wont let us forget that they beat us not once or even twice, but three times in a row.  
2:30- finally got home from hockey hell weekend and took a shower.
and now... i will be doing nothing

dont you all wish you could have such an awesome weekend like that??

today was my last day of real school at hell/school.  im so glad.  i hate that place... well really i dont.  but im still glad to be pretty much done... kinda.  we had elective showcase tonight... there was a lot of terribleness.  but thats to be expected.

so i really didnt do anything this weekend.  went and saw oceans 12 last night.  i liked it.  it wasnt super great but it was good.  i think ill go smoke... some pot.

"event","I can't wait to be done with school.  i really hate it there.  more like i just hate that i have to do so much work that i dont want to do.  i talked to billy about it yesterday.  i really am just not motivated to do anything.  and even though i get stuff done (eventually) i dont do it to the best of my ability.  cus i dont have to.  at rmsel all u have to do is complete your work.  it might be shitty but u atleast did it so u get a gold star (aka ACCOMPLISHED!).  i only have like a month of school left.  im still gunna have a couple papers ill have to do next semester though.  oh well, atleast i wont be at school much.  

Bailey and i went to the Green Day concert last night.  it was so fuckin awesome.  we had so much fun.  it made me feel better after my shitty day at school.

I also got my ski pass today.  im sooo excited to go up.  one good thing ill get out of rmsel this year is this new winter sports elective.  we basically get to go snowboarding every thursday.  how awesome is that.  i cant wait.  My mom/dad got me my ski pass for my birthday.  i think my mom gave into that idea mostly because she's realized what a bad mother she's been lately and so shes trying to buy my love lol.  whatever.

so my birthday is in like a week and two days.  i cant wait to be 18 but im trying not to get too excited cus my birthdays always suck.  i wanna have a big party but i dont have anywhere to have it.  plus im gone the weekend b4, gone the week of, and i have hockey the weekend after my birthday.  so the only time i could have a party would be the tuesday or wednesday b4 thanksgiving.  and i dont know if people can do that.  whatever, i hate birthdays.  thats a lie, but again i try not to get excited.

"event","well i had a much better time saturday night than friday.  our party was fun and all but i spent most of the time being drunk sad which can also be perceived as me looking like im about to pass out lol.  but saturday night we had only a few people over.  this kid Prince (awesome name i thought) was fuckin hilarious.  man he was so much fun to hang out with.  we just chilled and played dominoes and had hilarious times.  oh and we also spent the entire night staring out the window at my neighbors house which was surrounded by the denver police and swat team (thats right, with guns).  our night also included listening to this idiot on the loud speaker trying to get this guy to come out of the house.  my favorite was ""please diliberately come to the front door with your hands where we can see them.""  haha like how the fuck else do you come to the door.  you dont accidently find it lol.  i also liked, ""Eric, sober up, put some clothes on, and come out of the house.""  haha what the fuck.  we had some good times though.  so after a weekend of partying we cleaned up pretty good cus mom of course noticed nothing.  but my room definitely still reeks...  even my hockey gear smelled, and i dont mean like its usual shit smell.  anyway i really hate this whole boyfriend thing of my moms.  i fucked up my hair this weekend and she told me shed help me fix it yesterday.  but when she got home from CB, from a whole weekend with mark (aka fuck face) she had to go over to his house.  and he's over here now too.  like they cant spend one fuckin day apart??  im starting to get really sick of how she doesnt give a shit about me and my sister much anymore.  i mean of course i dont want her shoving her face in my business but when you say you're gunna help your daughter fix her orange and blonde fucked up hair, that should be more important than fuckin around with your new boyfriend of two weeks who you wanted to bring to thanksgiving at your parents house?!  ya i shoved that idea down her throat.  alright im done bitching cus i should really be working on one of the 10 papers i have to write in the next month.

"event","we had a party last night.  it was pretty fun.  cept me and matt are done.  which sux pretty bad.  but i guess im used to dissapointment in my life.  i actually think its kinda sad that he was the one thing that made me happy in the past couple months.  and he didnt even make me feel that happy.  more like he made me feel normal.  and like someone cared about me.  i guess just knowing someone cares makes a difference.  but now thats gone.  and im back to hating my life.  seriously, if i wasnt such a pussy, i think id kill myself.

"event","well im glad my last update made so much sense lol.  anyway ive been working a lot lately (it'll be 30 hrs for this week).  which i guess is good cus im makin more money which is greatly needed.  but yesterday... colleen cut her finger really bad and it was really terrible.  i was trying to help her but there was so much blood and it would not stop bleeding.  and she was crying.  and there was blood all over the bathroom.  i wanted to puke.  i pretty much felt sick for about 3 hrs after that too lol.  thats why i will never go into the medical feild.  anyway tomorrow im going to this training session to be a student election judge on election day.  i thought i missed all the sessions but i guess this is the last one.  i should prolly find out where that is.  i also have two hockey games this weekend.  but of course they're early so no one will come watch.  i think im getting worse at hockey.  i feel like i cant skate for some reason.  i think something is wrong with my skates.

"event","sooo i went on my crew trip this week... yeah it sucked.  we did a whole lot of nothing.  we couldnt go rafting so we went to Walsenberg?  we went to the sand dunes which were windy and shitty, this pool which was actually pretty nice, bents fort or something like that which was alright, then we went to the raptor center which is really just 5 cages with some birds.  and we had to listen to the life story of every bird b4 we left which was so boring.  i just dont like my crew.  there are a few hilarious kids but everyone else is anoying.  and it was windy and cold the whole time too.  so overall, a shitty trip.  

i went to baileys vball game 2nite which kinda sucked too.  they played really bad and they lost for the first time all season.  but they're still league champs which is awesome.  but also my moms new boyfriend came to the game.  yes thats right my mom has another new bf.  and he's actually over here right now.  and they're in the living room and i dont hear anything which is really creeping me out.  dear god.

i also hate everything.

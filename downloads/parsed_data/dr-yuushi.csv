Greetings, students and staff of Seishun High. Please make yourselves comfortable.

I've opened up an interactive Question and Answer section here, simply because it's far more convenient than doing a paper newsletter and allows me to manage it in my spare time. Seeing as I *am* the school physician and will be teaching various health and sexual education courses, I thought it would benefit the student body to provide some Q&A time.

All questions can be posted and seen by everyone who views the board, so I would suggest anonymity to encourage people to be honest. I will answer questions to the best of my ability.

There are two simple rules.
1) Please keep your questions on topic.
2) If you abuse the privilige, you will be banned, and no longer be able to view the questions or send your own in. Thank you for your participation and cooperation.

<b>EDIT:</b> As much as I adore flattery, please do not use this forum to make sexual advances on me. Thank you. Such things are always conducted better in person, anyway.

<i>[ooc: Unlike Tezuka's Suggestion Box, Oshitari's Q&A is viewable publically. This means that everyone can see and read these questions and answers both in and out of character. I would ask that everyone please leave your comments / questions anonymously. If you must, include your character's initials. Oshitari will reply directly to your question to answer it. PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS. Post a NEW COMMENT with a 'Dear Dr. Yuushi' if you wish to submit a question. Questions not following guidelines will be deleted. Thank you! Note: This post is also backdated, to keep it at the top of his journal. -OYmun ]</i>"

It's quite evident that the entire body of teaching staff seems to have a combined IQ of 12. Or perhaps that's just the age we're all acting today."

"event","Aside from Gakuto, things at school have been pathetically boring as of late.

I hope the events taking place this weekend will be much more fulfilling than the past week at school has been. The students have been spreading the germs of a respiratory cold about like candy. It's rather vile. I hope none of the staff falls ill.

I do wonder what possessed Kouchou-san to arrange the rooms as he did -- although I don't mind sharing one with Sengoku-san at all. It could be far more unpleasant.

I am concerned about Gakuto and Kikumaru. Not as much about Gakuto, I'm quite sure he could take on a lion with just his bare hands and biting personality, but Kikumaru does not quite seem the type to be entertained by such things. <s>I hope my vacation isn't cut short by having to tend to someone's blacked eye or bloodied lip... honestly.</s>"

Hopefully dealing with the students for the first time won't be so traumatizing as to spoil it beforehand.

The staff seems quite nice, if a bit uptight. Perhaps we can do something to loosen some of those metaphorical ties a bit at some point before they're in the infirmary for ulcers before long."

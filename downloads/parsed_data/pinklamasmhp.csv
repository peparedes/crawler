"event","WOW...so i had a little chat with Andrew about the problem i sopke of in my last entry and he seems to understand, which is good! I told him that he was really unemotional and at least he could give me a hug every now and then! He was like 'well, ya, i'm not that emotional of a person, and i'm not ready for society's version of a relationship' i was like okay...could he have been more confusing?!?!?!? All i wanted to know is if he would hug me more, gosh thats all!!! (lol) Anyway, I think our little chat was sufficient and now i am HAPPY!! Wow, it feels really nice to be able to say that and actually mean it! I think now he will try to be better i really do, he hugged me before he left today! (YAY, ya gotta start somewhere!) Well, just had to let you guys kno how it was going! Luv ya.. :)"

"event","Question for you guys... What do you do when ur going out with someone that is completely not emotional and rarely gives signs of affection?!?!?!?!!?Boys are so confusing, um grrrrr...... I just don't get it. I really like Andrew but i have no idea what he is feeling because he gives off no caring emotions. For instance last weekend i went to New York, everyone asked me to call them once i got there to make sure i was alright and wasn't hurt, except him, he didnt even care. We have been going out for almost 4 months and we hardly go out and he always busy! not to mention, today he made a remark about one of our other friends realtionship and he's like 'ya, its almost as pathetic as ours' right then and there i wanted to smack him upside the head. I guess i never thought about it that much, but i just... grrrr...i want to perserve the relationship because i REALLY like him but i have no idea how to change the empty feeling i get... I need a hug... grrr.. lack of hugs is making me feel unimportant. Speaking of hugs, he like willingly hugs other people more than he does me, there is something definately wrong with that picture right there!!!! Well, i'm going to go and get some hug action and calm down alittle. Heeheehee hoohoohoo heeheeehee hooohooo... *breaths like she is pregnant* ... Thank you for listening to me vent, i just need to cool off and go stare at something pink for a long time, and maybe i'll paint my nails.. hmmm.. i wonder what color...:)"

"event","okay, so those of you that know me know that i am a pretty happy, excentric, accepting person. I don't know why but right now i want to go and die. So i have this friend and she means the world to me, but lately she had been being a real bitch. She will do stuff that is really rude and not even realize it and personally it is really starting to piss me off! She acts like it is ok to just blow me off all the time, and normally i would just give her the benefit of the doubt but i feel really hurt. I love her (in a friendly way) so much and i don't understand why she would do this. I really don't want to go into details but i just don't know how to comfront her about it. I hate that i cant talk to her about it without her going completely bulistic on me. Whatever happens i don't want to lose her friendship. This whole thing is making me feel depressed and i wish i could do something about it. She seems to be fine with the fact im not myself and doesnt seem to care. She keeps bringing up how her and and our friend maddie are going to go do something this weekend. GRRRRR............ don't get me wrong i love maddie and i cherish her friendship and i like the fact that my friend and her are becoming friends again, i really do, but she doesn't have to tell me the way she did right after she blew me off ya kno... i just need a hug and a diet pepsi, and i should feel better... i hope.. :("

"event","So, life at the moment is pretty pissy. Here's the story, my boyfriend, Andrew, and my friend Joe got into an argument a few months ago and now they dont talk to eachother. They used to be good friends but they talk badly behind eachothers backs and just basically accept the person's exsistance but nothing more. I am torn between the two because they just can't get over their fucking problem and make up. I met them both only at the start of this school year but i care about them both and i can't even describe how upset it makes me when they are at eachothers throats talking about oneanother behind there backs. I swear if i didn't know otherwise i would say they were both catty girls in a prissy fight over there pride. Niether one can seem to understand that by appologizing they would be the better man! GRRRRR.... It is sooo annoying!! Talking to them has done nothing becasue neither of them really want to talk about it or do anything about it, even though they were good friends at one time. I don't understand it to the slightest bit! Well for now i guess i will just have to deal and hope things will improve on there own. -_-"

I mean she tells me she's goin somewhere and be havin me wait on her. But instead of jus goin to where she says, she goes other places too and has me waitin for almost an hour. She always does that shit. I can't stand it! And this weekend is suppose to be my weekend cuz last weekend we barely spent any time together. So tell me why her ass is at a damn softball game and I'm here at home by my damn self watchin Avatar by my damn self!?! We were suppose to watch it together! She talkin bout I'm posda be there wit her and why tell her there's a softball game if I didn't want her to go...well I told her so that maybe later AFTER we spent some time together, she could go check it out. And when she took me home, we were suppose to put my fish tank together. See, shit always happens! I'm jus so fed up and tired. I'm tired of cryin cuz the shit she be doin. She does the dumbest shit. I swear that sometimes she takes me for granted. And not jus me but us for granted. I don't kno how much longer I can stand this! I mean yea we posda be gettin married and what not but I don't kno if I wanna marry into somethin like this anymore. We don't have any good times anymore. There's always animosity between us. Gosh I HATE cryin! *sigh* You kno they say ""Love conquers all""...but sometimes I don't feel any love between us. I mean I kno it's there but I jus don't feel it all the time. *sigh* I don't kno...I'm jus upset...It seems like I'll be spending my weekend by myself..."

"event","Oh man! Out of the 2 years I've been at Shoemaker, I have never seen a fight there. I mean yeah there are tons of fights but I never get to see them being an athlete and all. If you were an athlete and you were caught running up to see a fight or what not, you get in BIG trouble. So yea I've never seen one....until today! It was great! I jus was saying something about never being able to see fights on Friday ((cuz there was one on Friday too)) and Lo and Behold there was one right in front of me today. I was walkin to 6th period and these girls jus started boxin in front of me. I had to lean up against the locker to not get hit. My friend Dominique ((she was there with me)) told me that Desiree went up to this girl and was like Are you Courtney E****? And Courtney was like yea. And Desiree grabbed her head and stole on her ass. Courtney ain't even fight back. She just stood there gettin her ass whooped. Everyone said that it was bout time cuz she always talkin bout folks and actin like she better than everyone else. But yea Desiree had her all against the locker jus whoopin her ass! When Nicole pulled Desiree off her, there was locks of Courtney's hair on the floor! It was all her real hair too! Everyone was like ILL! Her mom had a nerve to come up here worryin bout how much money she spent on her hair...that's messed up. I would worry about my daughter first but whatever. That shit was raw tho! It was crunk! But yea anywayz...today in my shock therapy I think I tensed up cuz I caught a cramp in my muscle! It hurt so bad! The trainer had to reduce the hertz in the machine. But yea my leg is gettin better. I can't wait til I get to go baQ to basketball. Today after my therapy, I went to the gym and shot around. It felt so good. I can't wait. Today, Nyesha D**** told me that she might be going to Harker Heights next year so she has a better chance of getting spotted by some scouts ((even tho HHHS sux)). I don't know tho. I wish her the best of luck. But yea on Sunday my mom hurt herself. She was walkin the dog and she wasn't lookin where she was goin and fell in the street. She twisted her right ankle ((like I did last year)) and pulled her quad muscle in her left thigh. Ain't that ironic? LOL But yea I'm on my momz computer and I wanna talk on yahoo messenger. So holla!"

But yea my cousin and aunt came down here to get their hair done too. My cousin decided that she wanted to go to my dad's house. I haven't been there in about a month so I told her that we were gonna be there until like 12. Well we went at like 6:45. I saw my lil sis and played wit her. I ate my favorite type of rice and what not. Oh yea I also learned many things about my father that I did not know. I also learned the alphabet in Twi. It sounds so cool! But yea my cousin says that she's sleepy and wants to go home. It was only 9:00! I was so damn mad! That's why I didn't want her to go in the first place. But yea so we ended up leavin all early. Oh yea I know this might sound nasty but while I was there I had to take a shit. So I did and tell me why I stopped up his toilet! LMAO...yea I kno y'all probably think that's nasty but hey it's a normal bodily function so don't act like you don't do it! But yea it was hilarious. My dad and his wife was crackin up. Aaliyah ((my lil sis...she's 8 months)) started laughin too! LOL it was hilarious! Well my dad gave me a statue and a bag from Africa...they're real nice. He gave my cousin one since she was there. He also gave me one for Tea. But ummm yea so when we got home, my cousin was in the bathroom. In the bathroom there's like this statue on the wall. Tell me why she knocked it down somehow...it broke in lots of pieces so we couldn't glue it baQ together. I was like OMG. My mom was all like ""Don't worry about it. It's only a statue."" ONLY A STATUE!?! Shit let it be me who knocked the damn thing down. I would've gotten the 3rd degree! Goodness. But anywayz, they asked me if I could teach her how to wrap her hair. I told them yea and tell me why THEY were tellin ME how to teach her. Shoot they shoulda did it themselves! I swear, folks get on my nerves! Yea well me and Tea ain't really talk today ((as usual)). Yea well I'm watchin this show on the Discovery Channel called Blue Planet: Seas of Life. It's pretty interesting since I wanna be a marine biologist and all. I can't wait til I start studying it.

"event","That's right America! I'm out! Yesterday at our practice district meet, I pulled my hamstring really bad. We had just started runnin the 100 meter dash ((Coach took me out of the 4 by 2 and put me in the 100 open)) and we didn't even run 25 meters yet so we were all pretty neck to neck. Everytime I run, I increase my speed at about the 25 meter mark so I started to increase my speed. Right when I was pullin ahead, all I heard was a loud ass POP! I felt something and heard something pop in the back of my thigh...I screamed out FUCK! It hurt so bad but I still tried to run...I was in front ((only by a lil tho...I didn't reach my full speed yet)) and I started whobblin on the track while I ran...so I jus slowed down and jogged in while trying to reach for the back of my thigh. My friends Cherise and Shatoria helped me over to the trainer. I could barely lift my leg up. They took off my spikes for me and everything. The trainer wrapped a bag of ice around my leg. I couldn't run my last event so this girl named Nikki took my place ((in the 4 by 4)). Our 4 by 1 was horrible. The new girl we got runnin first leg is S....L....O....W! Oh man! I don't even wanna talk about it but yea we did bad. But anywayz, today I went to the trainer 6th period for my thigh. Last night when my mom changed the ice bag, the back of my thigh was HUGE! But today it went down ((now don't get me wrong, it's still big)). But yea I have a big ass blackish bruise smack dab in the middle of the back of my thigh. It's so nasty. I had to sit on the edge of my chair all day cuz it hurt if I sit back. But yea I went to the trainer and she was oh my goodness. She said I tore some ligaments and pulled my hamstring really bad. So I'm out now. I can't run district :( and Tea was talkin bout comin down here to see me run. She hasn't been to any of my track meets at all this year and now she's not gonna see me run...:( Yea well I got a pass to leave class early cuz it hurts to walk and what not. So now I'm in shock theraphy. They run electrical shocks thru the back of my thigh to get the muscles stimulated. It doesn't hurt tho. But umm yea...it's horrible...I thought I was gonna go all year without hurtin myself. Coach Mack said that even if I was good by Tuesday, I would pull it again on Wednesday ((district))...Yea well I'm done writin...my leg startin to hurt in this chair...so holla..."

They asked me about my hobbies and what not. Shoot they asked me about how many creative ways I could use a trash can...I was like what in the world! LOL But yea my friends Ryan and Marissa were getting tested too so it wasn't boring. Well we took a creativity test where we had to make pictures out of some squares on a paper. Then we had to pick one of the pictures and write about it. I wrote this poem off the dome called Friendship Portait. It was pretty crunk. But yea we also took a IQ test. it was pretty easy until one of the shapes turned into a reflection and rotated like twice...it was hard to find the right shape. I think I got the question wrong and maybe 2 more. But all in all I think I did fairly well on it. Then after that we took a test over math, science, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. It was aight. It wasn't timed and we could go and finish the sections at our own pace so I went to sleep during the reading part. It feel good too. LOL! Yea well I didn't wanna go to 6th period ((Track)) So I tried to make the test last...but it didn't. I was gonna go to sleep again but everyone was leaving and I didn't wanna be alone.

She got up and she still was in third place but after she went over the next hurdle, I'm guessin she was hurtin cuz she stopped and started walkin over the hurdles. I felt so bad for her. Then my friend Phillip was pullin up 2nd in the 300 meter hurdles and he fell over his hurdles! He fell right on his face...he didn't get up either. Everyone rushed over there to help him up. I was on panic mode on the real. I was hopin he wasn't hurt. But yea this track meet everyone ((not jus us)) was droppin batons or fallin or sumthin of that nature.

But yea after that we had to run a 2 3 2 2 3 2 ((for y'all non-track folk: a 200, 300, 200, 200, 300, 200)) Well instead we ran a 2 3 2 3 2 2. We jus switched the order. Shit tell me why the coach said we could do that but then after we was done she yelled at us for doin it! So we had to do an extra 300. So really we did a 2 3 2 2 3 2 3! shoot, I was ready to go home after that but we had to work handoffs since they switched the legs on the 4 by 1 again. They switched 1st leg and 3rd leg and I'm 2nd leg so I had to work with both of them. We had to work handoffs in the gym cuz it was madd windy outside.

"event","DAMN MAN! I'm tired of being quiet about how I feel and what I think! So I'm finally breakin the silence! Man I can't stand when some people jus trip for no reason...throwin tantrumz and shit...makin things seem bigger than they really are. I hate tempers although I have one myself. But the difference between me and some other people is that I can control mine (most of the time). Shit! People get on my nerves! Man why can't I just meet a cool person for once...someone to just chill and talk to and not cause me any grief? I need someone like that...just to make my day a lil brighter instead of darker. man if anyone readin this think that they are this person...u can hit me up on aim as sexie azz balla or yahoo as hostile_chick_84. Shit I jus need a friend...a <b><u>real</b></u> friend...

P.S. I might be frustrated but I'm hopeful"

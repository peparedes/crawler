My and Stephy have been dating for a little over 15 months now, and I love her more than ever. She is the most beautiful and wonderful woman in the world and hopefully the woman of my life. Off to college next year though, lol but not very far. Somehow I did'nt get into any colleges so I will be at Moorpark (by the way, who is all going there next year?). Besides that, not much but give me a call if you ever want to hang out...404-6206...

"event","Today was ok considering it was school.
Went swimming after school that was fun.
Boy Scouts was pretty lame.
But the worst part was part of the aggrement I made with Stephani'es Parents when i asked if I could go out with her is I would have to take HER and their dog for a walk. And I always try to keep my promises, but anyways the dog was pretty good but man...Stephanie was such a pain, stopping to pick the flowers, look at license plates (I'm definately looking for a new walker, she is just to much work).

I still love her though...like no other, I mean she is the most amazingly beautiful person in the world, not to mention the sweetest and most caring. <333"

"event","That was by far the best Easter I have ever had. It worked out so perfectly. I meet Stephanie at 9:00 mass and then she came to brunch with us where we met up with my cousins (my moms side). Brunch was really good, at Applebeas, lol... stephanies pancakes were pregnant. The brunch was alot of fun, everyone laughed really hard, then we got home and withing 5 minutes of being home we left for the horse races with stephy's family. I had a blast. Mr. Pitman bet for me and i had so much fun, i ended up with 10 more dollars then i started with, so i was pretty proud. Anyways i got to meet alot of steph's family there so that was nice and it was really cool to look at all the horses and then bet on them. As soon as we got back we walked to my house just in time to make dinner with my othere cousins (my dads side). Dinner was pretty good, but after i took all the kids to go get ice cream cause thats what i gave up for lent (and Dr. Pepper) and it sounded really good. (lol.....i got a tripe scoop...yummm) When we got back we all sat down and played double deck hearts. Me and steph played on a team cause she didnt understand the game but by the end of the night she was dominating. We ended up getting second place. :) Anyways...i havent laughed so hard in sooooooo long... it was really funny, the whole time we were playing cards was like one big laugh. Everyone left around 10:30 and then me and steph just layed down and talked and rested. Totally the best Easter Sunday EVER, so much fun. Thank you steph...... your the best, i love you. <3"

After school i got to spend some time with steph before i headed out to Sports Challea (spelled that wrong) to get ski equipment. Right after that we drove to mammoth, which seemed like quite all long drive, although it was cool to get to play with my dads 10 million watt candle powered uber flashlight. Anyways the skiing up there was incredibe..although today even though it was warm on pretty much the whole mountain..near the top it was about 10 degrees and with wind gust from 45 to 55 it dropped teh temperatre to below negative 40 degrees..(burrrrr..and it wasnt the cold that was teh bad part..it was the fliing ice chunks that hit u in the face) so we only skiied off the top twice today. Anyways..good weekend.. really miss Stephanie though :("

"event","Went snowboarding yesterday with amanda, aaron, chelsea, smak, someone i didnt know, and stephanie. It was a blast! We woke up really early (4:30) and was on the rode by 5:00 (in the morning..ahh). Anyways i had never been to either snow summit or big bear and it was awesome. I really enjoyed big bear cause the runs werent to difficult so me and steph could stay together yet i could do jumps the whole way down. It was really nice cause practically the whole mountain was a freestyle park. For lunch, me and steph had a hot dog and gatorade, man it was gooooood. At 1 we left to snow summit but took the wrong tram so we got to ride on this cow cart truck thingy (was an EXPERIENCE). Anyways after only two runs me and steph called it quiets and got some hot chocolate with ALOT of whip cream. Although, i did take one finall run wiht aaron and chelsea. It was rad, we raced from the top of the mountain to the bottem, it was so cool. We must have been going like 40 i think i turned like 10 times the whole way down (first time i ever bobmend a double black diamond) It probably would have been a tie but aaron nailed some kid and did some crazy flips in the air before smacking the ground. All in all i had a great time

P.S. Thanks Mr.s Levy, Amanda, and Chelsea for driving us... :)"

"event","So today i had to wake up early to do our stupid histroy project (which is pointless cause i have an automatic A in the class). Anyways, after a cup of coffee i was fine. School went ok, my back and butt hurt alot in those super uncomfortable chairs. OMG, my math class gets more boring every day, its absolutely terrible, i cant concentrate at all in taht class. Anyways, spanish class stank (wierd), but chem class rocked. We got to do this krazy kool lab were we filled ballons with Hydrogen (2) gas and then got to blow them up (it was funny watching Stephanie jump every single time..lol). So after school I didn't feel like doing HW so i called Stephanie and we made a pumpkin pie (way cool). Then me, chels, jason, and steph all went to the mall for holiday shooping, event thought the only person i got something for was Chelsea. It was nice though, we went to Johnny Rockets and had some shakes and food, tis good. Anyways, i cant believe chelsea bought our super corny lie about what i did instead of getting her her Chanukah present (hope i spelled that right). It was so great..by the way.. jason u took that one far). Then i came home and realized that pumpkin pie tastes ALOT better if u let it cool.. so i brought some over to Stephanie's along with some eggnog (jeeeeezzz, u haven't tried so much). THEN, OMG, i went to chelsea's to give her her presnet and her mom, a super duper physical therapist, worked on my back, and it felt SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOD :). Thanks Mr.s Eakins. Anyways, now i sit here and REALLY dont want to do my HW...........  dont think i am."

We had a lot of fun then went to Roundtable and got white cheese and peporani pizza. (Although Jason's drinks kept going all wierd and were different colors). Anyways, then we went and got babyscoop icecream scoops from longs ( i got pumpkin and cherries jubliee..ummm). Soon after we headed to Blockbuster and (after much debate) picked up Airplane. Then we all went home to eat dinner (even though we had just ate) and meet up at Jason's house. there we watched Airplane, jumpled on the trampoline, and sang songs and looked for shooting stars ( i got to make tons of wishes..yaa). It was a lot of fun.. :)"

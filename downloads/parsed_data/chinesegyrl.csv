"event","My second entry! Hm. . .today is a saturday, and I had a PVYO tryout! It went ok. . .but I don't think I made it. Because he complimented me. Everytime someone compliments me and says I did really well, I end up being happy and thinking I made it or something. That PISSES me OFF!!! O well, i'm kind of used to it now. 

I have so much hw. I've got to write a stupid essay in english, do some stupid French hw, I've got some Chinese hw, and some REALLY POINTLESS MATH HW. (My teacher is an idiot, she doesn't know ANYTHING about math... all the problems she gives us are SO pointless, and has nothing to do with math.)

Soccer today was gay. My team played pretty good. (Montgomery Fusion) but we tied. 3-3. The Refree was SOO DUMB. . .he made us tie the game. It would have been 3-1 if we had a diffrent refree. What a dumbass. O well. . . 

The government today is getting closer and closer to finding who did the hijacking. But, he didn't have to declare war. I think he did that. I heard it on the news, but I'm not sure thats what they meant. But, I heard that Bush declared war on like Afghanisthan???? Thats so dumb! The Bible says that the world will end because of a war. Hopefully, this won't happen anytime soon!!"

This is my first time on this Live Journal thing and I'm a little confused, but I'll probably figure it out. This is my first entry, and I didn't write much. I have a tendency of getting lazy with my work after I do that thing for a certain period of time. I'm like that in school too! Well, I'll try and post something up tomrrow. School, Church, Chinese School, Soccer, Flute, and V-ball make me so busy, I might not get to write sumthing often. Well I'll try because this helps me get out some feelings!"

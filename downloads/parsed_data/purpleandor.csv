"event","Okay it's Day 4 - We've stopped in Ames, Iowa for the WHOLE day. We arrived last night around 11pm Central Time and will be leaving around 10am Central Time tomorrow. Heading towards Chicago and Ohio... 
We saw a little bit of Idaho, Lots of Montana, and bits of Wyoming... they were all pretty well non-descript.. hills, and more hills... Then we hit South Dakota... Sturgis, Mt Rushmore, The Crazy Horse memorial, Rapid City, High Winds ... overturned pickups towing a 5th wheel ... with the 5th wheel in front ... it was a sight... Wall Drug - we ran into people we saw the night before at Rushmore. They immediately looked for Pooh, and was relieved to find him in the pleasant company of a saloon girl."

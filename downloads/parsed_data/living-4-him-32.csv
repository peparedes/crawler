"event","Well, I'm back again....I really need to work on updating this more often.  Thanksgiving was great...it felt so good to be back up in Maryland with my grandparents....I love it up there.  It was kinda sad though too....I saw my great great aunt Rachel in her nursing home....she's not doing good at all.  She's 91 though....so I think it won't be too long now till it's her time to go home.  Then one of my dad's friiend that he used to play softball with got diagnosed with ALS, which is also known as Lou Gherig's disease.  It's a HORRIBLE disease.  He was an all-american baseball player in highschool, played in college, and played on national fastpitch softball teams as recently as 2002.  Now he can barely walk, he can't move his arms, and you can't understand  a word he says.  The doctors give him about 6 months to live....and he's only 41 years old.  I'm convinced it's the worst disease a person can have.  At least with like Alzheimer's the patient doesn't know ow sick they are.  With ALS, his mind is perfect....he knows what he's trying to say to us....his body just won't let him do it.  It's horrible.....sometimes it's hard to wonder why stuff like that happens...but then I just remember that we don't belong here....this life isn't our home....so things are only going to get better for Kevin.  On a different note, I'm starting to study for finals now.  They start on Saturday Dec. 4, and on the 9th I get to come home for a month!!!  Hopefully I won't have to be home for all that time....I think I'm spending a weekend with Brady and Jon, and then another weekend me anc my roommate Chip are going to Snowshoe, WV to go skiing....then my family and I are probably gonna go back to Chicgao for new years!!!  I can't wait for that...I haven't been back home to Chicago for about 2 years now....so that'll be alot of fun.  Oh yeah, I finished my Young Life training too....so now I'm  a Young Life leader in Wilmington....I just don't know what school yet.  We have a new leaders dinner tomorrow night at John Gayle's house...he's the area director for Wilmington Young Life....so hopefully I'll find out what school I'm at tomorrow!!!  Things are going really well here...I love my school and all the people I've met....God's really put me in an awesome place here.  I miss home alot too....and worry bout dad....and about how mom's doing taking care of him alone....but I know everything will work out.  Well that's about it for now!!!  I'll try and do better on the updates!!!  Hope everyone has a GREAT Christmas!!!!  Here's a good verse for the holiday season!!!!

""But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him n a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.  And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.'""    ---Matthew 1:20-21"

"event","Well its been a while since last time, so I've got alot to write about.  Just this past weekend i went up to App. State to see a bunch of people that I hadn't seen in a while.  It was freezing up there.  The night before I got there it was snowing....a little different then the 80 degree weather we've been having at Wilmington.  App was awesome though - everybody up there is so nice and just really laid back....it really reminded me of UNCW.  I stayed with my friend Jaclyn on Friday night, along with Cindy, another girl who graduated from my high school.  I met Jaclyn's friends Tori, Matt, Sarah, and a couple others too...they were all super nice.  That night we all went to the $1.50 movie theatre they have in Boone and saw The Notebook.  On Saturday me Jaclyn and Cindy went to this old house off the Blue Ridge Parkway.  It was owned by some guy who died in the early 1900s, and now the Park Service owns the house and the 3600 acres of land that the guy owned as well.  There are trails everywhere, and we hiked about a mile to see the graves of the people who owned the house.  Supposedly the house is haunted at night.  You can go there at like 1 or 2 in the morning, and the lights in the house flick on and off....nobody lives in the house anymore so it's really freaky.  Saturday night I got to see one of my best friends from high school KARI!!!  It was soo much fun getting to see her again.  I saw her at the football game on Saturday, which was my first college football game ever since UNCW doesnt have a team, and then we hung out for about 2 hours later Saturday night.  I got to meet all her softball teammates, theyre all really cool too.  After i hung out with Kari I went to see my other really good friend from high school Alicia!!!  We went out to a couple places that night and eventually crashed in her dorm.  I got to meet her best friend at school, Meg.  They're so much alike its scary.  But yeah that was my trip to app state for the weekend.  The drive definately sucked....it took 6 1/2 hours to get there cuz of a wreck on I-40....it was like a parking lot for about an hour.  The drive back only took about 5...that wasn't too bad.  Now I'm back at school, ready for this semester to end.  I'm sick of classes, I'm struggling in math, I got a dang 55 on my Oceanography test, and I have a bio test tomorrow that I have to study for tonight!!  AHHHHHHHHHH!!  Im sooooooo stressed out.  Other than that, my Young Life training is almost done.  I'll be done in about two weeks.  I can't WAIT to be placed in a high school....its gonna be AWESOME!!!  Well that's aboutall that's going on right now.  OH WAIT, I forgot....me and a couple guys that live on my floor found a house on Wrightsville Beach that we're very seriously considering buying.  I'm calling a realtor tomorrow to see if we can't walk through the house and everything.  The house is right on the intercoastal waterway, it has a dock and everything, and is right across the street from the beach.  It would be SOOOO GREAT if we could get that house.  If not that house, I'm sure others will open up in the spring as alot of the seniors move out after they graduate.  Well that's all for now....there will definately be more to come!!!  Here's a good verse for today:

"event","Wow, where do I start???  Well this weekend I went back home to Charlotte to see mom and dad and it was FREEZING cold...I'm talking in the 40s cold...and to make a long story short I was sick by the time I got back to school here at UNCW.  This morning I woke up, sick as a dog, and had to go take a math test.  That seriously was probably the hardest test I have ever taken in my life...I know I failed it.  On top of all that, we have to pre-register for the Spring semester, which is time-consuming, stressful, and annoying all the same.  At least my schedule will be pretty good.  I'll have one class on Monday at 3:30pm, one class on Wednesday at 6pm, and no classes on Friday.  Tuesdays and Thursdays will be loaded, but I should be able to handle it.  I'm taking Human Anatomy & Physiology, English 201, Spanish 201, and Intro to Religion....only 14 hours so it shouldnt be bad at all.  I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do for this summer too.  I have three different opportunities to serve in the international mission field this summer, but I can't decide what one to go on.  I can go to Beirut, Lebanon, a country in the middle east, for 1800 dollars; or I can go to Indonesia for 1500 dollars; or I can go to Eleuthera, Bahamas for a couple of hundred dollars.  All have ups and downs.....I don't know how I'm going to decide.  Hopefully God will just tell me where he wants me to serve.  These past couple of weeks have been hard.  It's been mid-terms and I've just really been stressing out...and my walk with Christ has kinda suffered over the past couple weeks.  I'm  just kinda down right now...but I Know things are looking up.  I love working for Young Life...I can't wait to be a leader at a Wilmington high school.  Our retreat to Rockbridge was unbelievable...I can't wait to go back again!!!  Well that's about it for now...its gettin late, im sick AND tired...and I'm about to go to bed.  There'll be more later!!!  Here's a good verse for today:

""Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.""    --- 1 Timothy 4:12"

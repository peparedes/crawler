There are a bunch of people over right now, and I had to come in and take care of Chris's birthday present really quickly.  I'm going to get back out there in a second, but I just wanted to check in and say hello.

Last night, the Fyuss played a pretty damn awesome show, but they didn't go on until like 1, and I didn't get home until like 4.  I would have liked to have slept all day today, but we had to get ourselves to the wine festival.  It was a gorgeous day for it, and we spent a lot of time just sitting around on a blanket, drinking wine and people watching.  (highlights included the shirtless, nipple-ring sporting chubby dude.  Borderline man boobs there.  Also went on a very long winery tour with the purpose of being able to sample special wines at the end. The guy was longwinded and strange, but provided the catchphrase of the day.  During a long speech on his distaste for wine snobbery, he talked about how irritating it is when people swirl the glass and sniff it and all that.  He finished with ""Christ! Just put it in your mouth!""  Hah!

I really should get back to the party.  Whee!"

I am ordering some stuff from Sephora, and you can get free shipping for orders of $75 or more.  How much is my order?  $74!!!  Now I must find the cheapest thing I can to get free shipping!

Last night, Chris and I worked concessions at the Ravens game.  Open Space got the opportunity to have a stand for a few of the preseason games, and they get to keep all the profits.  It was a really interesting experience, but I am so glad that's not my full time job.  It was like a thousand degrees in that place.  Chris made hotdogs the entire time, and I prepared food (mostly nachos) as it was ordered by customers.  Those of you who know me will not be surprised that I was pretty serious about the gloves and all that.  Once the gloves were on, I only touched food, and if I did touch anything else, I washed my hands and put on new gloves.  The same cannot be said for this one dude who was working with us.  He had a glove on his left hand, then proceeded to pull Tostitos out of the bag with his <i>right</i> hand.  I very politely said ""Oh, there are gloves up there if you need one for your other hand.""  He put on two gloves, but then would wipe the sweat off his face and jack up his pants at every given opportunity.  Then, to top it all off, he totally ate a pork BBQ sandwich WITH THE GLOVES ON, then went right back to serving up food!  Gross!!

Also, this chick insisted on making a bunch of nacho trays like 2 hours before we opened, and they were all stale by the time people started ordering them.  It was just so damn humid.  So, of course, people were bringing them back, and we ended up having to claim SEVENTEEN nacho trays as spoilage, which is subtracted from the profit.  Nice job."

"event","I'm sporting some major bugbites, but it was completely worth it for the weekend I had.  

Camping Highlights:

- AJ and I were the only ones who actually wore the overalls ALL weekend long.  Chris and Rick totally didn't.  Suckers.

- Friday night's delicious meal - who would have thought you could cook such awesome food in the woods?

- On Friday night, the fire started dying, so Rick decided it needed some more fuel.  He dumped fuel on the fire, which in turn went up into the fuel can.  Rick shook the can, sending little tufts of fire all over the campsite and, incidentally, straight onto my foot.  I had walked over the get something from the back of the truck, so had no idea what had transpired until I felt searing heat on my foot.  I yelled for water and doused my foot.  All of a sudden, I saw flashlights and heard ""macho man"" voices.  It was the rangers, making their entrance at the exact wrong time.  One spotted Patrick's throwing knife and said ""That doesn't look like a camping knife,"" to which Patrick matter-of-factly replied ""No, it's a throwing knife!""  They then became obsessed with seeing all of our ids, which then became the theme for the weekend.  ""Do you have your id?""  ""Does that apple have its id?""  ""Does that fire have an id?""  You get the picture.  Anyhow, they left without major incident and we were back to the business of drinking.  Rick showed us his hand and I swept into ""Mom"" mode as soon as I saw his thumb and forefinger were charred and already beginning to blister.  Yes, kids, we learned a real lesson that night:  Don't just throw fucking fuel out of a can on a fire.  

- Falling asleep in a tent surrounded by the sounds of the woods.  

- Not waking up to an alarm clock.  Waking up when you damn well please to light filtered through trees and the sound of morning animals.

- Swimming!!! 

- Learning the most fun game ever, which I am going to play next time I am in a pool.  ""Whopper.....uhhhhh....*giggle*""  ""Maki Maki""

***break:  My cat just took a huge crap, and I can smell it all the way in the office.  Sgt. Grumbles craps like a man!***

- We scrambled up Cunningham Falls, which can hardly be called ""falls,"" then being imagined to be a polar bear by tourists Megan, Chris, Nick, and Rick.  Can't wait to see <i>those</i> photos.  When we came back down, Patrick told us about some douchebag who thought he was the Falls police.

- The tragic death of the salamander at the hands (feet?)  of Nick Rose.  

- DRINKING ALL NIGHT IN THE WOODS.

- I learned how to make perfect marshmallow roasting sticks.  

- A midnight snack of toasted cheese sandwiches made over the fire.

- Did I mention drinking all night in the woods?


That's all for right now.  Those who were there: what were your favorite parts?"

"event","So I had a bitch of a time getting back home to Maryland, which is why I suggested Northwest dine on a plate piled high with steaming balls, courtesy of yours truly.

I arrived at the airport in Detroit to find that my 5:24 flight had been canceled due to weather conditions in Baltimore.  They had automatically moved me to a flight that was leaving at 9:23.  I was pretty irritated - I was just ready to go home.  I don't understand how weather conditions could be that different between Baltimore and D.C., as flights were still merrily flying in to Dulles airport in D.C., which Chris thought he couldn't get to in time because of traffic (the woman said she could switch me to a flight leaving around the same time as my original booking).  So, I decided ""Let's go, 9:23!  It will suck to get home so late and not really be able to spend time with Chris, but what can you do?""  I checked my suitcase, got my boarding pass, and called my brother, who was by that time about 15 minutes away from the airport.  He came back to get me and we went out to dinner.

At dinner, Chris called me.  ""I just got a call that your new flight was canceled.""  Fuck.  I called Northwest to see about switching over to Dulles or Regan, but those flights were sold out.  They automatically put me on a 6:50am flight.  I was a bit distressed, seeing as <i>all of my shit was already checked in</i>, so I asked about switching to another airline.  The guy claimed I would have to go to the airport to do that, as to switch to another airline the agent has to walk to the other airline's counter.  I'm wondering why this guy couldn't get the same security clearance I do in the comfort of my own home.  It's called the Internet, jackass, and I've found it to be a handy tool in discovering the flight schedules of several airlines in the past.  

So we go to the airport, where I noticed immediately that first class passengers get the same number of agents as normal people like me.  While the few first class passengers were drifting in, the first class agents stood around with their thumbs in their asses.  Meanwhile, the counter down in regular people town was SWAMPED.  People were not happy.  A few flights other than mine had also been canceled.  There was no direction as to where to go to change a flight, so everyone just got in any agent's line.  After standing there for roughly an hour, this bitter little fat lady comes through yelling ""If you want to change your flight, you must be at counters 23-25!!""   Now, those are 3 of like 30 counters, and the ratio of people wanting to change a flight to people just checking into a flight did not support her absurdly low ""counters needed for the angry people"" estimate.  My brother went over to one of the designated counters, where the line was already of headache-inducing length.  I decided to stay put, as I'd been standing in that line for far too long already and figured it was only fair that I shouldn't have to go over to some new, longass line.  

The bitter little fat lady continued making things worse for the weary travelers.  She directed people to the phone stands that are equipped to help people change their flights.  Well, when I say ""equipped,"" I mean ""broken.""  She simply shrieked at the woman who shared this information with her:  ""Then you'll just have to go stand in line!!!!""  Geez.   ""I am the supervisor!!!""  I heard her scream at one old lady.  <i>Shit,</i>I thought, watching her enter into a pointless exchange with a girl trying to get to New York, <i>if she's the supervisor, we're in for a great time.</i>  The BLFL went on an on about how they couldn't go pick this one girl's luggage out of all of the luggage back there, completely ignoring the fact that the girl kept pointing at her luggage, still very much in her possession.  After a few more of these ""conversations,"" the BLFL turned around to scream at her staff, most of whom were trying their best to assuage the customer's concerns.  ""If ANYONE comes up to you who is not just checking in, DO NOT HELP THEM!!!""  I half expected her to tack some horrible insult onto the end of her proclamation; her words dripped with disdain.  

I stayed put, as there were only two people behind me in line.  I let them go ahead of me to check in, then I approached the counter and explained my situation as another man came up and joined my line.  ""I can't help you here,"" the woman behind the counter said.  I told her I'd been standing in her line for over an hour and that, had the supervisor set up a procedure before making people stand around pointlessly that long, I would have gladly waited in the other line.  ""She's been going around making announcements,"" the woman asserted, not meeting my eyes.  ""Ma'am,"" I said quietly, ""that's the first time she's been around."" She went on, saying she couldn't help me.  I asked if I could just wait until her line was empty; she didn't answer, so I took that as a yes.  The man behind me went ahead of me and checked in, then the agent loudly questioned the invisible people behind me:  ""Anyone here just checking in?""  By this time I was in tears, my extremely frustrating response to stress.  Even if I'm horribly angry and ready to get into it with someone, I cry.  It makes me feel weak, but it shouldn't.  It's just what I do.  But that's not what we're here to discuss right now.

In the end, I had to go with the 6:50am flight, as there were no more flights leaving the airport that evening - Northwest has the latest departures.  I had no toothbrush, no glasses, no clothes, nothing.  It was like fucking camping other than the fact I had a bed to sleep in.  Not to mention the fact that my brother and I had to get up at stupid o'clock in  the morning to get to the airport on time.  Or the fact that my brother missed karate yesterday evening because of having to come back and get my ass from the airport.  Or the fact that the FUCKING SUPERVISOR DID NOTHING TO HELP THE SITUATION FOR ANYONE!!!!!  Usually, when I am in the airport and see people getting pissed about stuff, I think ""chill, man.  It's cool.""  But last night I was surrounded by people who were angry for a really good reason.  We were all being treated like preschoolers in a mean old witch's house.  Yelling at people like that.  I wonder if they had a whole video on that in her training program, or just a question on a test.

Northwest.  Fucking bitches."

A couple got out and proceeded to scream at each other.  We had the windows up for the A.C., and never thought to roll them down to see what all of the crap was about. The guy crossed to the other side of the street, all the while looking back at the girl and yelling and flipping her off.  She stood by the driver's side, screaming her head off at him.  Finally, he disappeared around the corner and she stood in front of the open driver's side door, pulling her hair up into a ponytail with her hands, her eyes cast downward, toward the seat in front of her.  She dropped her hair and bent down, looking around under the seat.  She repeated this several times:  hair up, look, hair down, bend over and look.  Then she moved to the back driver's side door, opened it, and looked around for something.  She returned to the front door and repeated her previously established pattern.  Tom and I were basically trapped the entire time; she never even glanced behind her to see us waiting for her to move her car.  We didn't really mind, though, as the entire episode was pretty interesting.  Then, with an air of determination, she got into the car, slammed the door shut, and tore off and around the corner.  Unfortunately for her, the back driver's side door was still wiiiiide open. As she rounded the corner, families turned to stare, mouths gaping.  I really wanted to know what happened next, but we were going straight at the light, not turning.

I looked through some old photo albums and found this picture from one Halloween, I think 1996, when we both went as men.  Aunt Josette got all bent out of shape and made Erica wear earrings and blush, as if people would think she was really a boy.

I just really miss her, still.  I think about how my life has changed in the four years she's been gone and how much hers might have.  I'm 25, married, have a cat and an apartment, have just finished my first year teaching, and am planning travel and living in new places and countless adventures.  She is forever almost 21, forever beautiful and kind and painfully alive in flashes of memory.  I still remember fights we had when we were children, and when she got sick after eating handfuls of the wonderful sugar cookies my mother made each year for Christmas (and couldn't bring herself to make in the first couple of years after Erica died.  They were always her favorite), and her joy at performing in a play I directed (and the joy of the audience - she was hilarious as a daft witch in a Robin Hood spoof), and when I saw her for the last time without knowing it would be the last time.  We were both busy with college and all its related commitments, but promised to get together in the spring.  Less than a month later, she was gone.  The regret - we shouldn't have always said ""soon, soon"" - still stings, though not as sharply."

"event","So, I turned down the role I was offered in <i>My Fair Lady</i>.  Now, as long as I can get the money together, I can go see my brother in Michigan.

I really learned my lesson with the callback on Monday.  Don't drink and stay up all weekend when you have a final callback on a Monday evening.  I fucked up the song royally.  And after I  did so well at the first callback.  Oh, well - there's always next year.

I am disappointed that I didn't get Eliza, yes, especially since I haven't done anything in so long and I had so much fun just doing the scenes at the first callback I went to.  But who knows what the summer will bring?  

I'm hoping Ms. Jae can come over this evening and help me bleach streaks in my hair so that I can transform into punk rock Missy for the summer.  I've settled on blue - I have more of it left than the red, and it's such a beautiful shade.  

Chris and I leave for our trip on Friday evening.  I'm really excited.  I've been highlighting the tour books.  If anyone has been to Iceland, Amsterdam, or Copenhagen, now is the time to give suggestions on great things to do.  Besides the obvious in Amsterdam.

I really should go do something productive.  It was hard to drag my ass out of bed this morning - Tess and I didn't get back from <i>The Lion King</i> at the Hippodrome until about 1am, and then I couldn't get to sleep.  I went running around 10 this morning, but it was so damn hot I ended up walking half of it.  Also went to the natural foods store in town and was reminded why I don't like going there - the guy there comes off as kind of a dick.  A woman walked in with her son, who appeared to be quite well-behaved, and the first thing the guy said was ""Watch his hands - there are a lot of glass bottles in here!""  Chill, dick.

Oh, for those of you who have seen <i>The Lion King</i> on stage - I have seen it twice: Once in London in ummm 2000 or 2001 and last night in Baltimore.  Last night, in the middle of ""Be Prepared,"" some half dressed hyenas came out and the music changed to this bumping dance beat.  The lights went all crazy and suddenly we were in a gay hyena nightclub.  I did not remember that from the first time I saw it.  And that's not  the kind of thing you would forget.

Is this a stupid decision?  Am I going to regret it?  I think I have a really strong chance at getting this role, but I really don't know if I want it.  Maybe my theatre days are over.  Which is kind of a sad thought.

Dammit, I really don't know what to do!!"

"event","This morning, Sgt. Grumbles gave me a nice little wakeup call about a half hour after Chris left for work.  I suddenly felt him pounce on my legs and start rolling around and kicking and fighting - not my legs, but his little stuffed bird that he likes to ignore for days at a time, then turn on and pound the hell out of every so often.  It went on for like 10 minutes - it was too cute to stop.  Finally, when the bird has been fully murdered, he collapsed to rest.  I drifted back to sleep for about 15 minutes, then woke to find he had made a gift of the bird - it was 2 inches from my face.  

In other news, my trip to NYC with Nick Rose and Tess was fantastic.  The bus rides weren't too bad, although my restless legs bullshit made the ride home a tad uncomfortable until I fell asleep - what am I, an old man with that shit?

<i>Spamalot</i> was all that I hoped it would be and more.  Pure silliness flowed from that show like it was a .... silliness fountain.  All of the best bits from <i>Holy Grail</i> with lots of stuff added - everything that was added was perfect.  And the Playbill was the best Playbill I've ever seen in my life.

Dinner drew the trip to a wonderful close - after wandering around forever looking for Restaurant Row, we resolved ourselves to abandon the mission and go to an Italian place in Times Square.  We turned a corner and -- Restaurant Row!!  We walked up the street a bit, overwhelmed by the vast number of choices available to us, then settled on a Chilean restaurant (later we found out it is the only Chilean restaurant in NYC).  The atmosphere was warm and colorful and welcoming - wood tables and chairs, bright oil paintings on the walls.  The staff were attentive and kind, willing to explain anything on the menu.  We started in on the delicious complimentary bread and salsa-ish spread and ordered mojitos after convincing Nick Rose that no dent would be put on his manliness.  Funnily enough, the waiter shattered this when he greeted Nick's order with surprise.  We ordered two appetizers - empanadas and artichokes with shrimp.  The artichoke/shrimp thing was a perfect appetizer - the creamy artichoke topped with a homemade mayonnaise and simple steamed shrimp was refreshing and made me want more.  For dinner, I had fish (I can't remember what kind it was now) over rice topped with a seafood sauce - bits of shrimp, scallops, and mussels, all buttery-tender.  Unfortunately, we didn't have time for dessert and coffee, though I'm sure the dessert would have been incredible.  We asked for the check and were pleasantly surprised when the waiter (one of many people who attended to us over the course of the dinner - including the owner of the restaurant, who charmingly showed Tess how to eat Chilean soup) brought over three glasses of warmed port wine.  It was wonderful - like no port I've had (I always bought cheap stuff in college for late night sipping sessions with a housemate) - fruity and smooth and the perfect end to a perfect meal.   I absolutely cannot wait to return to that restaurant - to take Chris there and share the experience with him.

Today I am organizing the office - it is a cluttered, horrible mess.    Maybe I'll be back later - for now, this break is up!"

Tonight I have callbacks for <i>My Fair Lady</i>.  I rocked the hell out of my audition song.  There were two of us who were called back after last night's audition - I don't know how many others there will be from the previous two auditions...The other girl was really good <i>and</i> she got to do the cold reading last.  I had to go first.  And when I say cold reading, I <i>mean</i> cold reading.  It was like ""here's your script, do a Cockney accent, okay, GO!!""  Needless to say, I was not on top of my game having to go first and read and understand and spit it all back out again.  But, as Chris said, I have been called back and now all I have to do is be awesome tonight.

I actually honestly won't mind if I don't get the part.  If I get the part, that will be awesome - it will be the first thing I've done in a long time.  If I don't get the part, that will also be awesome, as I will have lots of free evenings for hanging out with my friends.  Also, if I get the part, I probably won't be able to go visit my brother.  So, we'll see what happens.  

I still have to finish cleaning the living room, take a shower, pick out something to wear for the audition, and eat dinner.  So, I suppose I should be going.

Nine days left of school.  Then two professional days.  I can't wait to be done with it.  If anyone wants to do anything fun with me, in two weeks I am all yours.  I am auditioning for a play and am more than just a bit nervous about it.  I know I can sing very well and act very well, but getting up on that stage and trying to convince people how awesome you are is a nervewracking proposition.   

<b>Speaking of getting up on a stage, are we planning anything, Gabe?  I am itching for ROCK.</b>

I made phone calls to parents whose kids are failing my class -- these are seniors.  The parents all asked if there is anything their kids can do, any late work they can turn in.  I hate being put in that position, because I am still developing the balls to say ""fuck no"" to them.  Well, maybe without the fuck.  That would take some MIGHTY balls.  I am constantly baffled at these parents who want to teach their kids nothing about responsibility and deadlines and everything about doing whatever they want whenever they want.

Four classes took unit tests (total of 130 tests), two classes turned in essays (66 essays), those same classes turned in projects (66 projects), and two other classes turned in research projects (60 projects).  My eyes are about to fall out.  Despite the fact I  asked my students to be patient (I am always very, very good about getting work back to them in very little time), a bunch of them came up to me and asked ""do you have our tests graded yet?""  I couldn't help myself; I just laughed in their faces.

Sgt. Grumbles is revealing a new side of himself with his first springtime.  Every morning at 4:30 he sits at the window right above our heads and chirps at the birds.  I don't know what this chirping thing is about - I have never heard a more birdlike cat in my life.  Anyhow, it's driving me nuts and leaving me grumpy.

Only about 30 days left of school - I just started <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> with four of my classes and hope I can finish it - I see the classes every other day, so we only have about 15 classes before the end of the year.  I wish I could say the same for my Multicultural Literature class.  I see them every day.  I'm getting tired of their delusional ""I don't have to do anything and I will still somehow graduate high school"" attitude.  One guy seemed so disappointed to learn that even if he gets an A this quarter, he can only get a C for the class - he swore he would work extra hard and turn everything in.  Today he slept like it was a rainy Sunday afternoon.

In other news, Nick and Tess and I are going to roadtrip it up to NYC to see <i>Spamalot</i> in June.  We are cheap and therefore bought partially obstructed view seats.  Nick has promised to dangle Tess and me over the railing so that we may see what is going on and report back to him.  

In July Chris and I are heading to Iceland, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen for 10 days of awesome.  

I would also like to try to visit my brother.  Maybe in June.  We have to figure out the cash situation first, though.  Speaking of money, it will be awesome when I am still getting paychecks all summer without lifting a finger.   As stressed out as I am with teaching, I cannot deny the greatness that is summer vacation.  I have so much to do - clothing projects that have been waiting for 2 years, cut out but never sewn.  Photo albums to take care of.  Letters to write.  A guitar to learn how to play.  Books upon books upon books to read.  And, most importantly, friends to hang out with.  All.  The.  Time.  

I should probably offer more of an update since I'm not on here much anymore.  Truth be told, life is about the same as it was last week when I posted.  I'm a little bit more exhausted, but more or less the same.

It got my hopes up, but then dashed them completely.  Apparently, the blocker thingy at work thinks Babelfish is hacking the page I'm trying to load.  

Anyhow, my birthday was great.  It all started Thursday night with a trip to the Orioles game, followed by an absurdly late night at O'Shea's in Baltimore.  Drank a lot, played darts, and watched in horror as Joel took a swig from a water bottle just sitting on the wall at a park on the way home.  Groooooosssss.  Crawled into bed around 4.  Thank God I had the foresight to take Friday off.  Poor Chris wanted nothing more than the sweet embrace of death as he wasted away in front of his computer at work all day.

Friday I spent some time with my brother, who came into town especially for my birthday, and my grandparents.  Friday night I was happy to see many friendly faces at the play.  Those friendly faces then moved on to another late (though not as absurdly late) night at Bateman's.  Saturday brought a <i>ridiculously</i> late night playing Asshole and laughing until I thought my face would fall apart.  You should have seen the beer bottles piled on the kitchen counter the next day.

It's funny.  I either don't drink at all on the weekend, or my entire weekend is fueled by alcohol.  There doesn't seem to be a happy medium.  Hopefully this weekend will be more calm.  I would really like to just lock myself in my apartment and sleep.  I'm tired of planning lessons and grading papers this week.  I just want to laze around.  

I'll be back another time.  Maybe in a few days.  I should see about making some dinner, as Chris will  be coming back from his tennis outing with Andrew."

I got on my computer at work on Tuesday morning, checked my email, and typed in the address for Livejournal, only to receive a message that it's been blocked.  That's right - no more checking my Friends page while I eat my lunch.  No more comment conversations to distract me from my planning period work.  

I am so sad!!!!!  

I really think they should block different things on students' and teachers' accounts.  Teachers should have access to pretty much whatever they want to have access to.  Anyway, it's not like they're doing any good blocking all this stuff, because I still had to tell 4 of my students to stop playing online games while we were working in the computer lab yesterday.

So, as a result of this, I will not be on here nearly as much.  I'm going to try to keep up with what is going on with you guys, but I don't really spend much time on the Internet at home.

"event","This week I am more or less a zombie.  <i>Into the Woods</i> has kept me at the school until ten every night.  So, 7 hours of rehearsal on top of the 7 hours I've already been at school.  Today I reached the giddy stage of tired.  That stage in which you appear to be energetic, but really your head is pounding with a headache centered right between the eyes and you feel the need to prop your eyelids with toothpicks.  

To add to the fun, on Tuesday two of my students got *this close* to an all-out fight in my classroom.  Following pure instinct, I started to move in between them, all the while thinking ""Oh, yeah, Missy - unless you've developed superpowers in the last 3 seconds, what the hell are you going to do about this?""  Two of my students broke them apart gently, and my co-teacher called for an administrator.  The kid who started the fight ran out into the hall and punched the lockers so hard there has been talk of broken knuckles.  This kid is a nutjob.  I just want him out of my classroom.  He's a smart kid and I've tried working with him, but the words ""anger management"" are not in his vocabulary.  Apparently, home life is hell and my heart goes out to the kid for that, but holy shit when you're 17/18 years old you should have SOME idea of how to conduct yourself in a social setting.

Anyway, when it was all calmed down a few tears came to my eyes (frustration, anxiety, adrenaline, the whole bit came crashing down), and the other students and I just kind of had a nervous laugh over the whole situation.  I walked them up to the media center as scheduled.  On the way there, the administrator came out of the nurse's office and asked if I was okay.  Of course, I lost it.  It's always when someone asks you if you're alright that the sobs you thought you'd brought under control come out with a fury.  I went to Kathy's office, had some tea and a chat, and then went back to my kids in the media center.

And I'll be damned if they weren't working harder than they've ever worked in the entire time I've known them.  They were so eager to please.  It was like working with little kids.  Two of them made me a card about what a great teacher I am.  It was really sweet.  

As for the kid who started the shit, I really want him out of my class.  I think I said that already.  I told the administrator that my classroom is no longer productive, that it's all about this kid trying to gain control.  The other kids are being neglected and my job has been reduced to that of a babysitter...no, warden.....no, <i>zookeeper</i>.  It's ridiculous.

I want to go teach at a school where people actually value education.  Is it too much to ask for parents to instill in their children a respect for the educational process?  Is it too much to ask for parents to do the job that has been handed down to them?  Or is that too idealistic of me?  Am I searching for an educational El Dorado?  

Dude.  What the fuck."

"event","I fantasize about leaving my job.  My number one fantasy is saying goodbye to kids who don't care, goodbye to grading essays, goodbye to not being able to pee for hours at a time because I have to be in my classroom.  The trouble is that I don't know what I would do instead.  I got into teaching knowing it wouldn't be my lifelong career.  I got into teaching with stars in my eyes, envisioning a classroom in which students would learn together and would enjoy it.  Instead, I am faced with students who complain daily about how much reading they have to do.  I am faced with students who tell each other to ""fuck off"" when we're trying to have class discussions.  I am faced with students who do the bare minimum when it comes to work and then expect me to be so riveted by their bullshit that I have everything graded the next time I see them.  

Yesterday I felt like I was drowning.  A student just joined my 4th period B day class.  He was in another class; I don't know what happened to make him change his schedule this late in the game.  We have just started reading <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>.  His previous class just finished the very same novel.  When I brought this to the attention of one of the assistant principals, he said I would have to come up with something for him to do.  Until May.  Because I am eager to please, I acted as if it was no problem.  Then I went home and graded the last of the projects I collected last week.  This weekend I spent over 10 hours grading when all was said and done.  My back hurt, my eyes hurt, and most of the papers were not worth my time. 

I had my evaluation today.  It's funny - despite how frustrated I am with this job, I still have managed to make an excellent name for myself here.  I am told that I am at the level they expect a veteran teacher to be at.  They say I'm at the start of an amazing career.  They say people talk about me, that I'm a true professional, blah blah blah.  I don't <i>want</i> this to be the start of an amazing career.  I want to be one of those people who turns their back on the conventional job to live a life full of art and creativity and travel and adventure.  I guess I'm just not one of those people.  

I have a problem with getting into things, excelling, and getting bored or frustrated.  I don't mean to sound full of myself - it's the truth. I'm tired of teaching.  Already.  I feel like I've done what I can do with these kids.  I've given my ABSOLUTE ALL to these kids and the vast majority of them have given nothing.  This is not what I want.  I do not want to be my department head - looking at retirement, not enjoying her job at all, just done with everything.  How do I avoid this?  What the hell do I do?  I need to play an active role in the financial stability of my small, 2-person, 1-cat family.  I can't just be a fucking free spirit.  But days pass and I don't do anything that I see as worthwhile.  

Before you say it, I <i>know</i> that some kids are getting a lot out of my classes; I know the whole thing about ""well, if you've touched one person..."" and so on.  It's not enough right now.  

I'm not going to quit my job.  Sometimes I fantasize about it, though."

EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE HUGE.  I've spent the past hour trying to find the ""resize"" button, but there isn't one.  Well, eeeexxxxxcuse me, iPhoto!"

"event","I saw this commercial today while I was eating my lunch.  It was one of those ""Hey, do you invent stuff?  We'll help you!"" kind of things.  And at the end, this dorkyass, uglyish dude suddenly appeared by a pool with a gorgeous blond in a bikini (he was still wearing a polo and pants), who handed him a frozen cocktail.  I want to invent things so I can have such fabulous objects as a pool and a woman.  Advertising is lame.  I'm glad I'm not hot so I don't have to just be an item.  I mean, I'm dead sexy and all, but I think it's safe to say I will not be mistaken for a model any time soon.

In other news, I made candles today.  Tomato (courtesy of my Demeter bath oil) and Satsuma/grapefruit.  For the latter, I added some grapefruit zest and stirred it as it solidified to try to keep it from sinking.  It might work or it might suck.  Time will tell, my friends; time will tell.

I wonder if I will have off school tomorrow.  If so, it will be a 2 day week for me.  I'm taking off Thursday because I have to go to lame old traffic court.  Apparently I was driving too fast.  Wednesday will be a mad scramble to get my substitute plans ready for Thursday.  I have a shitload of work to do at school, but have no idea what's going on anymore since I haven't been there since Wednesday.  And that was the first day since the Thursday before that!!!  Damn!

Snow is supposed to get heavy today.  Right now it's not sticking yet.  I plan on doing some more artistic stuff today.  I wish I had someone snowed in with me to create crafty things with.  That would be fun.  I wish Chris taught, too, because then he wouldn't be at work right now and we could be baking cookies and laughing like we're in a commercial for Tollhouse cookies.  Except we'd be making real cookies.  Yes."

"event","This weekend, I bought a book on bead crochet.  I was so excited, I had to get right into a project.  So, last night I decided I would make a small purse.  I *never* just ease into anything - I have to dive right in.  So, not only did I decide to crochet with beads for the first time, I also decided to work with Fun Fur for the first time.  I also didn't have enough of the fiber I was stringing the beads on.  So......

What I said was something about being respectful and not saying stuff like that blah blah blah.

What I wanted to say was ""Hey, let's get off moms...'cause I just got off yours""  and totally own them all."

What is your most vivid memory of me? 

Even if we haven't met outside of Livejournal, I suppose you could still remember something...

"event","Today was another conference day.  Well, <i>is</i> another conference day, because I'm still here.  4-7pm.  So, when I leave I'll have been here for about 12 hours.  Niiiice.  I suppose I shouldn't complain, though, because doing this and having the one last week means we have a FOUR DAY WEEKEND the 19th-22nd.  BUT I have to drive over here anyway on the 22nd for rehearsal for the musical.  Can't we all just have a damn day off?!

I cleaned the office a bit this weekend.  Got the computer stuff done.  It was kind of the end of an era, as I finally packed up all of my old computer games.  Now that I have the Apple, nothing is compatible anymore.  It's sad - I only played <i>The Sims: Hot Date</i> once.  I have a ton of great old games - old Sierra games on diskette.  I won't get shit at a yardsale.  Maybe I'll post the list on here and all of my fellow gamey geek people can fight over them.  I'll sell them cheap.  It sucked bagging up hundreds of dollars worth of awesome games, never to play them again.  Brought back memories of staying up all hours of the night playing Gabriel Knight, wandering around fighting the forces of voodoo!!

I worked a little on a traveling journal a friend of mine started.  It made me want to get back into some kind of artistic expression.  This year has been draining me.  When I get home from school I just want to sit in front of the tv and watch Chris play <i>Resident Evil 4</i>.  I really need to start doing something creative again.  And I have to really learn the damn guitar.  And write.  And, well, just do something!

I have a headache.  I think I've been stood up for one of my conferences... I only had two to begin with.  Yep, two 15-minute conferences.  Stayed 4-7.  Fabulous."

"event","There is something really nice about sitting here listening to David Bowie and drinking a Coke, enjoying a few moments before my students come in.  Ahhh...

So, I put aside the crochet project I've been working on.  It's a scarf made with some really thin rainbow yarn.  I'm working a triple crochet, but it's still slow going.  Anyway, I was getting tired of it and thought ""well, there's no rule that says I can't put it down for a while.""  I bought a huge plastic crochet hook the other day in the hopes of trying a hat (I've only made scarves up until this point) and so I decided to get down to it.  Chris stocked my stocking with some really nice yarn, including a creamy colored lamb's wool and acrylic blend (of course he bought me the yarn I would never buy myself because of the cost - I stick to what's cheap or on sale usually!!).  I started and was surprised to see how incrediby easy crocheting a simple hat can be.  I finished quite a lot of it in an hour, which was encouraging.  I'm excited to finish it and wear it, though I might come up with some creative embellishments before all is said and done.  It's so fun and easy that I want to make a whole slew of cute hats!!  

Then I'll try knitting, finally.  I mean, I've <i>tried</i> it, but haven't made anything.  I bought a set of circular needles to try a hat, and a few kits to make scarves and wraps and stuff.

Anyway, wow, that was pretty boring for you guys.  Sorry about that.  I get really excited about craft projects."

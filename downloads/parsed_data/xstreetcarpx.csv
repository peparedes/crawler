"event","Mental Institution

To dream that you are in a mental institution, indicates a need for rest and reset your mind. You need to not be afraid to ask for help/assistance when you need it.

To dream that you are outside a mental institution, suggests that you are feeling ostracized or shunned. You may be close to a mental breakdown. Or you are feeling left out, excluded, and ignored. 


Subway
To dream that you are in the subway, denotes that you are reaching your goal via unconscious methods. You may be exploring hidden aspects of yourself. Alternatively, it suggests that you are making a hasty decision.

Vomiting
To dream that you are vomiting, indicates that you need to reject or discard an aspect of your life that is revolting. There are some emotions or concepts that you need to confront and then let go.
To see others vomiting in your dream, signifies false pretenses of people who try to take advantage of you. 

Bus Driver
To see a bus driver in your dream, indicates leadership in some group idea or plan. It is symbolic of collective power. Alternatively, it suggests that you are going around in circles and have showed little progress."

i decided to make a post after realizing that my entire friends page has been taken up by community posts, and not friends posts.

I won't try to stop you
When you speak of the past
Doubt is over now
And I can join in when you laugh
Fascination makes us ask for more
Than we'd like to know
I needn't explain
I think you know

Reassure me when my heart's
Not bold enough to bear her name
If you were in my shoes
And scared I would do the same
And though I may ask
There's no need for past details
For though I may laugh aloud
My courage fails
Did you know?

See how I've changed now
My head's so clear
<b>Still there are some things
That I don't want to hear</b>
There must be so much I know
That you cannot forget
<b>And I mustn't wish your life began
The day we met</b>

Places we go remind you
Of when you were here before
So you talk and tell me
You don't think about it anymore
There is something I know
Hasn't quite been left behind
So I'll ask you once again
To prove that I don't mind
To prove that I don't mind"

im trying to talk to thiago and i keep on sobbing because all i want to do is hold him. not only are we not together, but we are...(how many miles it is from here to north carolina) apart. its been more than a month i think. im trying so hard not to be sad and be happy that ill be getting out in a year or so and moving on to new things, but these memories haunt me every day. today me and billy went to the beach area where the yaht club parking is and the mural where the merman and mermaid are holding hands...there was a couple there who were being all coupleish in the same area where me and thiago once sat, and he threw an old braclett an old girlfriend gave to him to show me he was devoted to only me. im an emotional person to begin with. dealing with this has been the hardest thing i have ever endured.

once school starts up again im sure i wont have time to sulk. im taking:

piano II
music theory II
Aural Skills II
band
volleyball (haha wtf)
some english
algebra II 


whats even gayer is that i need to take another english class over the summer because im behind aparantly, and you need 2 semesters of english.

i dream of going far away and being on my own. i dream of performing at carnagie hall and being surrounded by music.

as for now, i feel so alone.

I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images and
When we kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make us into
Corresponding shapes like puzzles pieces
From the clay

True, it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this
That catch my troubled head
<b>When you're away, when I am missing you to death</b>

When you were out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

I've tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat
Sounded thin upon listening

That frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll say...

i spent my morning in the hospital area since my moms boyfriend got really sick again. i stayed with him and my mom since i had a doctors appointment in the same building. the nurse asked me how old i was, and i gave alot of thought to my answer. i dont beleive im 18 for some reason. but im going to suffolk today to get my books and find my classes with my cousin. maybe hopefully ill transfer after like a year the most to oneonta? i hope. me and my thiago are trying to contact the music department to see if i can do my music edumacation stuff there.

yesterday was my thiagos birthday. i surprised him by taking him to this brazilian buffet which was so delicous. we each had 2 bottles of guatana each, and i actually tried some of the meat since it smelled so good. then we went to the woods and ate brownies on the forest floor and took pictures of each other hiding behind trees. we then came back to my house and played in my bed and watched movies.

since my digital camera was eaten by more car, i have to pay 10 dollars to get those memories back on glossy paper."

                            i see thiago at least every other day. i think the most weve gone without seeing each other is 3 days at most. july 20th will be 2 months we've been together...which is not only my longest relationship, but the best. never have i felt so beautiful and so loved. our days consist of laying on each other watching movies, going to brazilian markets, salsa dancing, eating at fancy restaurants, going into the city and having almost sex on the train ride home, blaze ing and bowling, and other things of corse. he makes cute lion noises and fake claws at me and i squeeze him in a fit of love. this is the boy ive been waiting for...deep dark eyes, aztec-like skin, curly black lion mane, cute nose ring on a beautiful brazilian nose. im so in love with him...

the other day me and thiago smoked and went bowling...so much confusion at the counter. we were next to a 6 year old birthday party on the next lane, and i kept on laughing at them. 

ive been thinking about august when hes going to have to leave and go to oneonta again....thats what keeps me up at night and makes my stomach tense with worry. i finally found the boy i was ment to be with and hes leaving for 7 months. but i will visit as often as possible and stay for long periods of time since he will have his own room. we'll get through it...im just being silly."

so today i spent the whole day sunbathing at my thiagos place of buissness...which is a pool. but more on our adventures later.im very sleepy, and just wanted to introduce him to everyone on livejour....oh my goodness ive been writing in this thing for too long. anyways, hes very specialtomeandum....i really do love him. he is the first boy i have ever really loved. at the pool we danced at twilight and just held each other and looked into each others eyes for an hour or more. his eyes are so dark you cant see his pupils. but when i stare hard enough i can see into his soul. sappy and gay sounding but so very true. i know he is my other half."

"event","i went great lengths and brought a hair brush to school. i havent pulled shit like that since middle school when i actually cared to much. every chance i got i brushed my hair to keep it unfrizzed and striaght. in every class my right legs bounced up and down jerkingly, and i had a cold dead stare ahead of me. 

as soon as i got home i put on lotions and powers, and more eye make up. i changed my jeans and sneakers (which help me move faster in school) to a skirt and slippers. i wasnt moving any where fast that night. i wanted to go as slow as possible and drrraaaggggggg it out as much as i could. 

i pick him up and there are no words. just giant hugs. nothing was awkward. everything was natural. i still cant describe his touch in words....it was warm and loving yet strong. exaclty how a lions touch would be. we go to see star wars since..i dont know thats what we decided to do. during the movie we held hands and i rested my head on his shoulder. we made fun of the horrible acting, and swore we would buy this adorable lizard thing that made the best sounds. after the movie we stared at each other in surfer rosa as the sun hit her just perfectly. we exchanged more hugs and then went to dinner.

while waiting outside outback i snuggled myself as close as i could get to him. i grasped his arm while he explained what all the clouds were. then he gave me a beautiful purple swirl necklace that looks like mermaids themselves had put it together. i hug him even tighter and loose any words i had. he puts it on and says how all the other girls were so jealous of me. thats when its official. we stare at each other some more and i stroke his mane and he wraps his arms around me. then we eat and discuss family issues. that was the only time we werent touching each other in some way. 

after we are done, we get icecream at friendlys and go to a beautiful lake near his house. we lay down a blanket and roll around and wrestle and nibble at each others necks. i stare into his big dark eyes and kiss his nose (which was just peirced and was hurting him), and i could feel my heart melting. in his eyes i see so much love and passion and stregnth. he makes lion noises and i giggle and  pounce ontop of him. this goes on for hours...staring, and playing, and kissing. 

i woke up this morning and felt my neck. the necklace was still on, and i could still smell him on my lips.

"event","Join the resistance!!!! I hear we are going to hit close to $3.00 a gallon
by the summer and it might go higher!! Want gasoline prices to come down?
We need to take some intelligent, united action.

Phillip Hollsworth, offered this good idea: This makes MUCH MORE
SENSE than the ""don't buy gas on a certain day"" campaign that was
going around last April or May! The oil companies just laughed at
that because they knew we wouldn't continue to ""hurt"" ourselves by
refusing to buy gas. It was more of an inconvenience to us than it
was a problem for them. BUT, whoever thought of this idea, has come
up with a plan that can really work.

Please read it and join with us! By now you're probably thinking
gasoline priced at about $1.50 is super cheap. Me too! It is
currently $2.09 for regular unleaded in my town. Now that the oil
companies and the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the
cost! of a gallon of gas is CHEAP at $1.50- $1.75, we need to take
aggressive action to teach them that BUYERS control the
marketplace....not sellers. With the price of gasoline going up more
each day, we consumers need to take action. The only way we are
going to see the price of gas come down is if we hit someone in the
pocketbook by not purchasing their gas! And we can do that WITHOUT
hurting ourselves. How? Since we all rely on our cars, we can't just
stop buying gas. But we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all
act together to force a price war.

Here's the idea: For the rest of this year, DON'T purchase ANY
gasoline from the two biggest companies (which now are one), EXXON
and MOBIL. If they are not selling any gas, they will be inclined to
reduce their prices. If they reduce their prices, the other companies
will have to follow suit. But to have an impact, we need to reach
literally millions of Exxon and Mobil gas buyers. It's really simple
to do!! Now, don't whimp out on me at this point...keep reading and
I'll explain how simple it is to reach millions of people!!

I am sending this note to about thirty people. If each of you send it
to at least ten more (30 x 10 = 300) ... and those 300 send it to at
least ten more (300 x 10 = 3,000)....and so on, by the time the
message reaches the sixth generation of people, we will have reached
over THREE MILLION consumers. If those three million get excited and
! pass this on to ten friends each, then 30 million people will have
been contacted! If it goes one level further, you guessed it.....
THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE!!!

Again, all You have to do is send this to 10 people. That's all. (If
you don't understand how we can reach 300 million and all you have to
do is send this to 10 people.... Well, let's face it, you just
aren't a mathematician. But I am .... so trust me on this one.)

How long would all that take? If each of us sends this e-mail out to
ten more people within one day of receipt, all 300 MILLION people
could conceivably be contacted within the next 8 days!!! I'll bet
you didn't think you and I had that much potential, did you! Acting
together we can make a difference.

If this makes sense to you, please pass this message on. PLEASE HOLD
OUT UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO THE $1.30 RANGE AND KEEP THEM
DOWN. THIS CAN REALLY WORK."

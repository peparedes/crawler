"event","<p align=""center"">So, I am now going to start posting daily, or on the days that i get one at least.<br/>I feel it will be a good way to see what has happened and such in the past.<br/>Today was actually relaxing and i enjoyed it.<br/>I got to school, semi-on time.<br/>and homeroom wasn't that bad.<br/>In math i just sat there, and did my math homework for next class, so thats crossed off the list.<br/>Then in science i did all kinds of homework in the begining of that class, that were due today.<br/>It went by quickly, and i found out that dike is indeed a termination used while talking about volcanos. awkward huh?<br/>In literature we had a test on the book i didn't read, but Andres explained it to me so im going to laugh if i get a better grade.<br/>Lunch was, interesting. I had salad, yey me. and erm, me christine and dustin were in a licking war.<br/>Spanish was fine, we have a little pinch of homework, and the lesson was SOO easy.<br/>Then in homeroom the PFL playoffs were taking place so everything was hectic.<br/>I sit at the desk right next to the PFL desk so i had to get outta there.<br/>Me and shaun were staring our of the classroom window and Sarah found it to be pathetic.<br/>So pathetic she took a picture of it, its actually quite funny.<br/>Junior High Singers comes next, we got yelled at twice, once by Mrs.Chang and once by Mrs.Ortiz.<br/><strong>They can both suck my cock.<br/></strong>After practice i went to Christines house for a little bit and discovered a one man band [literally] that only has 13 friends.<br/>It made me giggle.<br/>Now im at my grandparents house and bored as hell wishing to go home.<br/>Later on tonight i will be doing spanish homework and going to the gym.<br/>FUN EH?<br/>no.<br/>okay well thats about it. see i told you it wasnt that bad.<br/><br/></p>"

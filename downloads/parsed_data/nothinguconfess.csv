"event","soo guess what i did last night?

i cried. alot.

well, i came home after an all nighter party in norwell and i was a wreck and i was all pissed of because i realized how incredibly not tan i was, so i went tanning, aka got out my neutrogena tan in a can.

when i came downstairs and my whole family was gone. that should amke me happy, but it didnt. so i went upstairs and watched smallville, and i was going to go to bed when i was done, but as i was going up the stairs i saw sally, and she was so cute and i started to cry. yues her cuteness brought me to tears. not good. 

so i went to the basement and went on aim and no one was one, so i started to cry a little bit, like 3 little tears. 
and then i went on livejournal and nora hasnt updated in years b.c shes camping, and i started to cry b.c i havent seen her in a while.

and the i really started cryng because i havent seen shana in who knows how long. like the last day of school. 

shana you made me cry.

and thennnnnnn i saw my friends update about her crying because one of our friends is moving to new mexico and then i started crying alot. and then i saw annies update from earlier and i started crying REALLY hard because shes moving and we only became friends a few weeks ago. and then i remembered im going to camp with her in two weeks.

and i cried some more because i was afraid i wouldnt get my hair cut until after camp.
why did i cry about that? i have no idea.
you guys may think im kidding, but i'm not. 
so i layed down on the ground and went to sleep.

not a fun night.

but i'm ok now.

anyone else have some awesome nights like that?"

steph urkos away message made a very good point. eveyone thinks tri county is the deliquent, retard school, but i'm here to prove them wrong.

in the  past two weeks there has been :

- a break-in trying to steal the prom money, and then they turned all the stoves on
 -a creepy stalker-guy taking pictures
 -a drug arrest that includes a chase around the school property ( im guessing thats what we saw during tv production, katie and annie)
 -and an electrical fire in a closet 

ahhh never take this pace for granted, guys. think of the memories you'll take with you when you leave. and hopefully you leave the school aliv and in one piece. PLUSSS i missed huckle today! caitlyn and i were crying for joy
PLUSS PLUSSS theres a rumor of no school wednesday?? PLUS PLUS PLUS i have one more day top do my essay paper!  KAKP"

today went by really slowly. actually thi whole week has.
junies class- boring almost fell asleep

homeroom- we might get donuts this week! shana made me laugh. what else is new?
 
science- not worth mentioning

math- miraculously got a b-, b.c i def. had a 76 last week. he prbably put in the wrong letter. oh well. mr. kummers a fotard so end of story. 

tv- got mad. people always want to be on wake up warriors, but come time for them to actually be on it, they all chicken out. so, i had to convince a few people to say there fav. line in nap. dynamite. yea i got like three people. including tom. he jumped right infront of the camera and i had to hold my self back from doing anyting... hes so hott. and then people made stupid comments...and gestures... and lets just say my partner wasnt to appreciative. 
OH! and best part. shana reinacted the tater tots part, and it was so funny, b.c for effect i hit her pocket and killed the tot she had put in therem and her face was hysterical! it was like this wicked cheesy smile, i was aughing so hard i swear a little bit of pee came out. 
english- we had to do these miny presentations. so i was in a group of evan dennerly and kara sullivan, and we had to write down on a huge piece of paper  some points on the personality of our character and my group had scout. so evan made this one point that i didnt really agree w/ but i didnt feel like speaking up and crap, and i didnt really undertsand what he was saying either, but i was liek ok whatever, hopefully i wont have to explain that one. but somehow!! ms. eyes on the back of her head, hears everything, knows all omnipotent huckle new i didnt know what that part was talking about, so she had me talk about that part anyway! so i was up there and i was like ""umm well this means... ujm.... she took the gum, so shes headstrong and.....yea.......the teacher took her paper and did you know.......umm..... yea i dont know what im talking about. sorry"" and i looked over at ms. suck-le and seh was shaking her head and rolling her eyes. it was funny and yet i almost cried at the same time. bad day

gym- josh malone fell on me. i cant talk about it...



whats up for kims birthday? and boston... id remember what you said this morning nora... oh and can you bring my vest in tomorrow? thanks much!

"event","well today was wicked fun. 

started w/ tv production... annie called me a stripper. lets not talk about it

history- i was sitting with my feet out in the aisle and she freaked out on me. shes so paranoid

bio- saved a project that was VERY quickly going down the drain. itll be a miracle if we get a b

 french- i opened the window and she never noticed!!!!!! me and rob very carefully slid it open and she never found out! i was so excited. oh and me and shana got out of our detention. we had to not talk for all of 4th lunch. i had to sit facing a wall in an empty part of the classroom. and shana had to sit in the middle of a bunch of kids who were all trying to get her to talk. it was so funny. and everyone was like lauren what are you doing? so id turn around to like motion for them to shut up and ms. fig would stick her ugly make up drenched face in the door and say "" uh, gigi...  you dont want to have to stay after school today?"" and then shed laugh. every effing time some one said lauren she did this!!! EVREY FRIGGIN TIME!!! 

english- got my opinions shot down ms, huckle style. shes so biased. Gene has mental issues and you wouldnt push some out OF A TREE IF YOU DIDNT HAVE A FRIIGIN ANIMOSITY AGAINST THEM! SERIOUS!!! YOU DONT GET IN A TREE ANS SAY TO YOURSELF, HEY I'M GOING TO PUCH MY BEST FRIEND OFF THIS BRANCH AND SEE HWAT HAPPENS!! YOU JUST DONT!!! NOT EVEN STUPID NEUROTIC DRAMATIC BRAIN DEAD EUGENE FORRESTER!! PEOPLE JUST DONT DO THAT!!! genes been complaining about finny the WHOLE ENTIRE BOOK! ahhd okcjd'ckmkj'kdvkj'k i cant talkl about it,


health- by far the funniest class yet. brian dennehy(?) was trying to reinact the mendes falling and killing himself at the game yesterday w/ his gatorade bottle. so he hit it agains the desk and i was like "" it sounded like that"" and then he was lik eno it was louder. so he wound up, found a point on the desk, and slammed it. the cap shot of the bottle and the stanky, nasty yellow contents rained everwhere!! no joke. its like some one sood on a desk a peed. it was abs. hysterical. and then tk wanted bd to get him a condom. he was like begging. so bd got him one and tk was like ahh yes, im gonna have some fun this weekend and some one said "" dude who would have sex with you?"" AHAHAHAH!!!! it was the funniest thing ever!!! and then a few minutes later burt was like ok so anyway, we 're going to start reviewing for midterms.."" and tk said "" what? dia ? what?"" ( all the guys in my class shoretn everything, so dia is short for diarrehea and they always say it when we're talking about like injuries and crap) and the room wnet silent for a minute. and tom was just siting there laughin at how awesomely funny he is!! and sam jackson goes "" tom, for some reason it just isnt funny when you say it...""
i almost died!!!!! today was like the greateest ""tkd"" day. and then bd blew up a condom and throwing it around., adn even though taht wasnt very funny, eevryone else in the room was cracking up, and that was funny.

"event","ok is all this really worth it? some people are loosing friendships, back stabbing people, becoming the top placer on kps most hated list, and so on. 
for all you not in the know how, all of this mayhem is being caused by one simple evert: a high school drama christmas play. 

please dont get offended or mad at me b.c im treating the play like some incignificant event , because i understand how much it mattered to all of you and how hard you all worked for it. but this is getting ridiculous. ya'll just need to let things go! so some one had a wardrobe malfunction, so someone was like 15 seconds late for que, so someons hair looked like it had been picked off the road 20 minutes before hand. who gives a flippin helluva crap!?!?! the play was a tremedous success and everyone did a fantastic job! instead of tearing each other apart, and ripping out hearts and feelings and sending valuable friendships down the pie hole, we should all be thankful we did as well as we did.     

everyone just needs to stop yelling, complaining and gossiping about one another. stop being so stessed... i know thats like on the list of most impossible things to do, next to plucking your eyebrows and painting your left hand nails in a car, but i promise you its worth it. life isnt THAT bad!

next time your about to say soemthing to someone, stop and make sure that one: someone isnt going to cry over it if they ever hear it 
two: is it worth all the trouble one statement may cause? ( ie, losing a friend) 


so im going to  start this thing... and hopefully it will make everyone feel better.... hopefully

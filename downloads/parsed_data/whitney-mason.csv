   I havn't written anything for over 6 months.  I have to admit i kinda forgot I even had this for a while. Oh well.  I'm so bored right now and of course the one night I have no life (well actually that's all the time) but the night I actually get online nobody is on at all.  Oh well I guess I will get over it.  Things have been going pretty good for me lately.  umm I'm still working at good Old Do it Best. (I just can't seem to get away!lol) I have a boyfriend (jeremy) he's a sweetie we've been together just over a month now. Unfortunately though carrie and I are still doing pretty shitty.  I don't expect nor do I want to become great friends again, but the big trip is coming up in a couple of weeks so the two of us will be stuck in a not so large house together for a week. It would be absolutely wonderful if we could get through that one week without ripping each others throats out. Oh well I should be able to get through it Deidre is gonna come up for a few days when she doesn't have to work so that will be a relief.  Plus amy will be there too I guess but we aren't very close anymore either.  It's so weird how much changes in one year.  I guess it's prolly just because I switched schools, but still it's so weird that a year ago I was best friends with carrie and really good friends with Amy and now I can rarely stand to be around carrie and a hardly ever see or talk to amy anymore.  I always just talk to Deidre or Kelly or Jeremy usually. It seems crazy.  I'm at home a lot more often but it really doesn't seem that bad. I read a lot and I'm always on the phone.  Plus lately I've been pulling weeds. (My mom is paying me five dollars an hour.  Oh yeah!) anyhow I guess I'm done going on about my life lately.  It's fairly simple and boring, but oh well.

"event","Hey guys!  It's been such a long time since I've written in here and actually it's been a while since I've seen most of you.  I've been doing ok latley.  you know me!  I've been working on the weekends and haning out with Ally, Manda and Sarah, and of course Care and Ams, and recently Clint and Justin.  Clint is the new guy that I'm kinda with but not really.  If you guys think back a while you may be able to remember the first guy I was with at norwell (Todd) then we broke up and right away I got with John and John and I just broke up and now here's clint.  I dunno what to do I'm, so sick of all this shit.  I cheated on todd with john and then I cheated on John with Clint.  I need to figure out a way to stay with these people and not freak out and then look for reasons to break up.  And I definately need to make sure i stop the whole cheating thing cuz That's not gonna fly anymore.  But I dunno what to do about it.  Then to make shit more confusing I was talking to Todd last night online.  (this was basically the first real conversation we had since the breakup) he told me how mad he was when I figured out I had cheated on him with John of all people and that he felt like shit after I did it and he was asking me why and I explained all this crap to him and told him how sorry I was, and I also mentioned that I wanted to be friends again because when I was friends with him I was really happy. and he told me that he didn't know if he could trust me as a friend and also that he had a problem with being friends with his ex's because he would usually start to like them again.  So we talked for a while more and then he told me he wasn't mad about what I did anymore and that I should call him and he signed off really fast.  So I was up alot last night thinking about how much I must have hurt John too. So I told Clint I didn't want to get together cuz I don't want to hurt him. and he was like if you feel that way then maybe your right.  I swear with Clint I can never say the right thing.  He always makes me feel really bad when I say I have plans to go out with my sister or my friends instead of him.  I shouldn't feel bad for wanting to go out with my sister should I?I don't even know anymore.  I Keep telling clint I just wanna be friends, but then we get together we end up making out and doing otehr stuff like that too so basically I'm sending him way mixed up mesagges about what I want so I don't even know if I know what I want anymore.  wel I'm out!  I miss you and loove you all!

Anyhow then we went to care's where we all went phyco and had a ball.  Anyhow I had to go to work at 7:30 this morning basicallty the reason for my being so tired.  And Amy's at church right now but when she gets home we are going to bluffton street fair to see todd.  Speaking of which we had a very long conversation about food that we like the other night and I was saying that I like fruit rollups better than fruit by the foot so yesterday he bought me a box of fruiut roll ups.  Yes I'm sure you are all thinking wow this kids gay, but I thought it was cute!! Anyhow i think I'm going to go now and call kel cuz I was just thinking that matt lives in blufton (I think maybe he just works there, but I'm pretty sure he lives there too) so I'll see if kel and matt are going to go tonight.  I dount they are, but It would be cool.  I'm off like a dirty shirt

"event","Ok well I havn't written in a really long time.  I've ben busy moving and I've had a lot of stuff on my mind that I kinda wanted to get figured out and stuff. But anyhow I started school today.  it was cool. In home room i talked to this guy tod (I believe) and I talked to him on my way to first.  I din't really talk to anyone in first except to ask if I could borrow some paper and ask where my next classroom was.  So I went to 2nd and this girl ashlee sat next to me and we talked fo5r a little while then after class she took me out to the commons to introduce me to some of her friends and then she showed me where my 3rd period class was.  I went through third not talking to anyone (bad idea cuz that;s the class I have lunch in and it would be nice to have someone to sit with at lubnch so I guess I'll work on that tomorrow)so anyhow finally 4th came along nad it's in the same room so i just sat in there for like 5 minutes waiting for the beel to ring and the next class to start. Tod is in this class too so after the teacher got done talking I talked to tod for a while and then we walked to the commons and talked some more there and then we headed outside and then he headed off to go look for his car because he forgot where he poarked.  well while sitting in my car I saw him find his car which I feel I should add is a red mustang.  So anyhow that was basically my school day.  Then I went to the new house unpacked some stuff blah blah blah so anyhow we finish moving this weekend so if anyone will need to get a hold of me or just wants to call because they no that I prolly have nothing else to do the new number is (260)597-7295  It's long distance though.  Sorry

"event","Ok well being done with the complications we had yesterday, I'll tell you how grossly pathetic my day was today. Well we got up went to do it best to buy painters tape and rollers and cleaning supplies and all that other fun stuff.  The we headed out to the new house and got to work cleaning drawers and coupards and shelves.  Then we tore nails out of the walls took of wall cover plates and spackled the holes.  After that we headed out to do a little running in which time I decided that I want to start taking Guitar lessons. SO anyhow we went back to do it best because we had to get the paint mixed and we couldn't do it earlier that morning cuz I promised libby that she could do it and she wsan't there that morning.  So anyhow Libby mixed the paint for us while I talked to Carrie Kay and Cecil.  So anyhow after thatI came home claened my room and boxed up some more shit then ate dinner and headed back out to the new house. Well we get there and lindsay and I start cleaning out the garage, I mean my bedroom well same thing really buit anyhow there were bugs everywhere and we mopped it twice and it still looks yucky but what can you do? So anyhow after that I came hometh and thereis my whole day.  Fun stuff huh?  Yaeh right.  and I get to do basically the same thing tomorrow except I work at 3:15 so I won't go out the second time.

"event","well it's wednesday tonight and I havn't written in a while so I suppose I should tell you all about the meeting on munday wich was funny cuz Care was pissed at chris the whole time and everyone kept trying to steal my money and Aaron was puting shugar packets in my purse (yes I know he's an odd one!) but anyhow that was about all that went on on monday I believe.  Tuesday was much more exciting. I woke up at like 6 or so I believe to leave for cedar point and ended up sitting around for like an hour and a half waiting for Carrie's slow ass family to get ready.  I mean monday night they were looking for a place for us to stay at tuesday night and then Tuesday morning before we left they realized that they didn't have anyone to take care of the dog!  SO they were calling people to take care of dusty! so anyhow we got there at like 12 ohio time.  the day was really fun but I got really bad blisters from my sandels and lindsey and alli didn't want to go on millinium with care and I so care didn't want to go either I guess I dunno but we did do power tower like 5 times! so anyhow it was really funny cuz the dick wasn't working as usual and there was a long ass line.  I was all why would you wait in line for a rolar coaster that hasn't been working the whole day?  they kept trying it over and over but it wouldn't make it over the top it  was really pretty funny.. well for the whole day Care and I were making fun of lindsey for looking like trailor trash cuz well she did.  we said she was keeping all the hott guys away form us though I'm sure it doesn't help that me and care look fairly young and Care's sister is like 12 or somthing like that!  But oh well!  we wouldn't really need to meet another Nate anyhow I mean we did that last summer!oh well.  So anyhow we left the park at like 11 when it closed and we went to go to walmart to get a bathing suit for lindsey. well number one I'm tired as hell and number two lindsey is too pickey specially cuz your at wal mart what the hell are you going to find there??  so anyhow we leave there a bit later with no bathing siut to buy, and head to the motel.  when we got there i laid down and fell asleep to the arguoing of the sorg family what a suprise!  (they fight 24-7) SO I get woken up this morning to go eat breakfast downstairs which I do  then I go upstairs to zip up my bag and sit around and watch tv while we wait for alli to get out of the pool then we load up and head home finally! SO i get home simply to get yelled at for getting home so late because it's now almost 2:30 and I was suppost to go to norwell to get registered and all this shit so I go change really fast and we head there.  well by the time we get there the offices will be closing in 10 minutes so they tell me what I need to get and make an appointment for 10 tomorrow morning.  Then we come home where I call into work to make sure they havn't scheduled me wich they decided to do so I go hop in the shower and get ready in like 10 minutes.  bUt it's all good cuz work ws really really fun.  Kay and I just kinda gooffed off the whole night.  so that's about all.  jeez that took a while so anyhow I got the new number today.        597-7295

It was kinda loing and boring, not like the other ones wee we are there for like an hour and half the time all we do is talk.  LAst night we had to talk business like the whole time, and when we weren't talking business, then we were writing up thank you cards for people like bruce and brent for taking us thought the cave and to the family whose land the cave was on and to the Legion for giving us $1000!! Buit anyhow, we did get everything figured out fir the big trip.  We are leaving on Saturday at like 12 so I'll be gone form then until the following saturday! I'm really excited it will be so much fun.  And the night before that (friday) I get to go Lisa's birythady party.  Speeking of which, I need to call kel so I can go shopping with her cause I need to get lisa a gift.  Anyhow, after the meeting, I went to care's to watch some episodes of angel then I came home and got online for like 10 minutes if that.  Then I went to bed, but I wasn't tired so I went into Lindsay's room to watch a movie or somthing, but I ended up looking through one of the boxes she had packed up and found a bunch of book.  SO me being the reader that I'm well not decided to read a book. SO I was up till 4:30 this moring reading a book.  It was really good so the minute I woke up this morning, I started another one. So anyone who is redaing this that really knows me they are prolly just about as scared as I am~!  Britney and readoing ahve never really mixed that well, so I'm kinda scared about my new found love of it.  But oh well, whatever works!  Anyhow I'm out to go keep reading.

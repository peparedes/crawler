"event","O how I loathe early Saturday rehersals. No one sane should be up at 7 on a Saturday. But yet I was. And o it was long. But Erin gave me my giant ass gumball, so I twas occupied for most of the time. God I love those things. Then walked up to Subway with Er, in the POURING RAIN and through the FLOOODED FIELD. God we were so soaked when we got there. But we were hungry, so who cares? Then back to the school to pain the signs since NO ONE stayed at all *glares* But twas mucho fun and all the such.

Got home, went out with mine daddy for a bit, got dinner. Listened to the drunk people downstairs who were starting a stunning karyoke game. God it was like 5:00 and this guys were just drunk out of their minds. O my god it was like the funniest thing ever. 

Home again, home again. Watched The Notebook. That movies really good, but its just so sad and sweet. I think theres a reason I stay away from those kinds of movies. Because you know that sort of thing only can happen in movies. Twas good all the same though. But now I do feel rather sad from it.


Oy. I do not know what is going on with my mind. Do make it stop. Tis too confuseling :\

It was a Sugarcult kind of day today. That song kinda describes my mentality at the moment, not that anyone cares but hey Im letting you know anyways.

Got home, cleaned stuff up a little, almost managed to burn my finger off quite a few times. I have such great skill.

Came downstairs to basically 'hey we hate our daughter'. My mum leaves again tomorrow, I dont know if I can take living with my dad again, he was home for all of 2 seconds today before we started screaming at each other. Fun stuff there.


*She gets sad when there's nothing going on, yeah
She says it makes her feel damn worthless

"event","Science magazine came out with a report on the difference   
between men and women's brains. Apparently women are more   
controlled by a part of the brain called singletgyrus.   

Men are more controlled by a part of the brain known as the   
penis.   


Hahaha Well I thought it was funny...


It always seems like the questions that you dont ask are the only ones that get answered. But the reason you never asked them to begin with is because you dont want to know the answer, or else its already clear... 

I just need to shut off my brain. Life would be so much easier then."

Unfortunatly twas all just for the wedding, but I will never argue about spending an hour in DSW to find shoes. But I did find shoes, and theyre so adorable, theyre black with white polka dots, ahh I love them so. Then we went to the mall to grab some stuff and it was just so freaking packed that it was annoying. All the agressive stroller driver ladies geez. Got home and chilled for a little then went over to Sars to babysit her brother haha I love that kid hes too funny. Did the entire freaking bio packet though. And was supossed to be watching the incredibly fun and interesting Spongebob Squarepants Movie, but texting Matt was just so much more interesting lol. But what I saw of the movie, was....hahaha interesting, but it was funny, which could be kinda sad. And now am hoping to go to Erins and gift and hang out and the such. O la de da happy mood."

Came home and hung out for awhile, but then my sugar high began to wear off and that kinda sucked. So went to take a bath, turned up my Goos really high and sung along loudly and probably out of key sometimes, but who cares, since I couldnt really hear me anyways. O but it felt nice, its such a good way to destressanize yournself. 

And now I am home to watch my Friday nite standup and such.

Gah, I really wish my head would just stop...thinking. Its making everything so confusing."

Its odd, things that used to completely ruin my day, now just seem to roll of my back. They just never seem to click right away thankfully. But at the same time things that never made me look twice now bother me more than ever. 

Aw, one of the little kids at rehersal just made my day though. He was sitting next to his sister and turned to her and was like ""Wait, how are we supossed to sit down in a kilt?"" God I have no idea why I thought that to be so funny, but it rather was, it was just so cute.

No one really talks to me, so yeah I guess its great I get to get some of my homwork done. Yeah. Right. I guess I realized alot about who it is that really does care about me.

Watched Pirates of the Caribbean and fell asleep. No problems there, Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are two faces I deffinatly dont mind falling asleep to :) Got up early and Alex and Tara came over and we went to brunch? at this really awesome restaraunt in DC. Mmmm sooo yummy. Then went to see RENT. Ahhh omg it was so incredibly amazing. Thats probably all I can really say about it. It made Kelly very happy. So yes, rather good day.

Hes a total freaking slob and cant do a damn thing to help with anything. I dont wanna be taking care of a house, Im freaking 15 years old.

But then I had mac n cheese and then a Snickers that I stole from my little cousin, and I calmed down quite a bit.

Theres no one left there to impress but yourself, and you already know yourself well enough that theres no need for impression. That all you can do is sit and think, zoning out to whatever it is thats on the tv for backgroud noise, because the silence will just make it worse. But you just sit and think. Think about how everything is going. Think about the day and days gone past and the days to come. The days past are the worst, because those you cant change, and the days to come are frightening because you dont know what it is that can happen. Sit and think about what life brings. Theres always the good things, friendship, love, that sudden feeling when everything just clicks. But at the same time everything seems overshadowed by the bad. The broken fights, the tears cried when you think everyones backs are turned and no one can see you, the feeling of being so alone and no one caring. The need to hide everything from everyone. Because you have to be fine. But nothing ever works out that way. You just have to smile through it all. Put up a lie on your face for the world to see and try to make them believe that lie because you need to try and believe it too."

17-year-old student admitted to sending the brownies to a

could explain,"" according to the police report. The student

"event","Yeah well. Nothing interesting ever really seems to be open. Watching Super Size me in health still. Ug, that movie makes me never want to eat McDonalds again. But want a hamburger at the same time lol.

Rehersal today. Heather was in a surprisingly good mood. Even though we cant dance. But hey, minor detail.

Ive never been so unhappy not to be distracted...

I dunno, nothing really seems to be going wrong on the outside, but for some reason I just cant shake the feeling that something is wrong. I just dont feel right. I really wish people would stop thinking I live a perfect life, it doesnt help.

"event","Yep. So went to Montgomery Mall with the madre today to get a dress for the wedding. And there is nothin that can make you feel poor more than walking through the Nordstroms at Montgomery Mall. Just wow, that made me feel like trailer trash. But after forevers of searching found a dress. I like mucho, its muy cute :)

Got home, painted again. The room looks very good now too. Very purple. 

Wow, so this weekend has been really productive for me. But its really sucked too, since I got to spend it all by myself. Wonderful. Because I do love being outsided from everything, its just so nice.

Ug, more homework. And school tomorrow. Charming. I wish it were break already."

I know how my family thinks rubs off on how I think about certain things, like myself. My mom wouldnt trust me if it would save her life. She really doesnt believe where I got the money for my new shoes, so I think she believe that I stole them or the money. Of course, because thats all Kelly does. Im sick of shit with people, spending weekends by myself, being by myself in general. Its starting to get to me, just watching peoples making me sick. 

Ya know, itd just be nice if for once, something worked out in MY favor. And no, I dont think Im being a selfish bitch. Because all the good lightning bolts hit everyone around me, but just land in a circle around me. But always missing me.  

I wish there was something left that was really worth living for. Because most things seem shot to hell as far as I can see.

And that she never heard of cancer

And make her feel b.e.a.u.t.i.f.u.l*

"event","Ive been feeling so strange and reflective lately. Its rather odd. And almost creative, and we all know how truly creative Kelly is...I Think its also since now my house is nice and empty and quiet. No one yelling at me or noisily walking around downstairs or lauging horribly loudly on the phone. Of course this doesnt manage to happen more often...

I think Ive come to the conclusion that Im going to end up as the ""cat lady"". You know, the lady that lives all by herself in a big house, except for her like 16 cats. And she walks around in really ugly sweaters and leggings and bunny slippers, and you see her at the store buying eggs and pounds of cat food and you point and whisper. I think Im gonna end up as that lonely old lady. O well.

Nothings really horribly charming now, I feel like such a bitter person, but I cant really help it. I get to have certain things that Im bitter about.

Ug what is it about your head that it cant manage to control the rest of your body? Like your eyes, that your inner mind tells you to look down, yet you cant. Or your feet, since tripping and falling always seems to be so unavoidable. Or your stomach, that just seems to completely drop. What gives? As that song goes *the farthest distance Ive ever known is from my head to my heart* Obviuosly. 

Perhaps off to start those mounds of homework. Or eat. Hmmmm, work or food....so difficault of course..."

"event","Ooo so I am back from the glorious Boston. It was really damn fun. Went shopping with me aunt on Monday. It was so awesome, since I was like the only person in the stores, except for the ladies that think theyre still juniors but theyre not. So they go shopping during the day so that no one else sees them shopping there except the other age confused women. But other than them, I was like the only person there. And all the people were looking at me all weird since it looked like I was skipping school, which I wasnt since school really was canceled here too. But the guy at the Pac Sun was really hot, so it was all good :) Aaand I got these incredibly awesome NEON ORANGE Chucks. O theyre so awesome, so that day was so good. And flew home Tuesday. I looove flying at nite. Its the prettiest thing ever to look down on the cities at nite. The lights look like sequins on some ladies black velvet dress. I dunno, thats the only way I can think to call it. I know, I just have this way with words. 

But now Im back in the o so wonderful Poolesville. Ug. I really wish that I was back in Boston. I didnt have to wake up and put on a happy face, because I really was happy. I cant ever remember times Im more happy then when Im there. Theres nothing to worry about up there. But of course I had to come back and realize that theres still a world here. Wonderful. I wish the world would just completely disapear, its not like theres anything worth it left in it. And I dunno, that might sound pessimistic to some people, but I really think that thats true to me. I dunno, it just seems that when I get back everything seems to hit me all at once, and I dont want it. Any of it. Im not back into everything yet. I just want to enjoy everything for now, but I cant. Ug, make the world go away."

"event","A couple of San Francisco teenagers thought the perfect   
present for one of their girlfriends would be a pair of   
koala bears. The duo visited the San Francisco Zoo after-   
hours and snatched the creatures. Unfortunately, the girl   
didn't find the snarling pets to be charming and the boys   
had to bring the koalas back to one of their homes. They   
put the koalas in a tub filled with carrots, oranges and   
leaves, but the malnourished marsupials started to die.   
Acting on an anonymous tip, authorities busted the teens.

It's not uncommon to steal a few things from the office   
every so often. However, it is a problem if you're a   
coroner's assistant. Jurek Ladziak's line of work allowed   
him to obtain a collection that included a skull, body parts   
and a number of ID cards of the dead. After Ladziak   
assembled his work, he decorated his warehouse-apartment to   
resemble a warehouse-morgue. Someone tipped off police to his   
dungeon of death, and Ludziak was hauled in on charges of   
possession of stolen property.


O lord people are so incredibly strange. Who gets the idea that a koala makes a good gift? Thanks, I think Id rather have chocolate instead. 

Its so odd. I go to sleep at nite with my house being loud and annoying. And I keep coming home to it being empty and quiet. Relations keep going places. Its kinda strange.

Nothing so incredibly eventful today. Going out to dinner later for me cousins birfday to Red Lobster. Mmm yummay :)

Gah, I wish I knew what it was about you.

"event","Most people got married in June because they took their   
yearly bath in Mary and still smelled pretty good. However,   
they were starting to smell, which is why brides carried a   
bouquet of flowers to hide the body odor.   

Baths consisted of a big tub of hot water. The man of the   
house had the nice clean water, then, all the other sons and   
men, then the women and, finally, the children. By then, the   
water was so dirty you could actually lose someone in it -   
hence the saying, ""Don't throw the baby out with the bath-   
water.""   

Houses had thatched roofs - thick straw, piled high, with no   
wood underneath. It was the only place for animals to get   
warm, so all the dogs, cats, and other small animals lived   
in the roof. When it rained, it became slippery and sometimes   
the animals would slide off the roof. Hence the saying, ""It's   
raining cats and dogs.""   

There was nothing to stop things from falling into the house.   
Bugs and other droppings could really mess up your clean bed.   
Hence, a bed with big posts and a sheet hung over the top   
afforded some protection. That's how canopy beds came into   
existence.   

Sometimes folks could obtain pork, which made them feel   
quite special. When visitors came over, they would hang up   
their bacon to show off. It was a sign of wealth that a man   
could ""bring home the bacon.""   

Those with money had plates made of pewter. Food with a high   
acid content caused some of the lead to leach onto the food,   
causing lead poisoning and death. This happened most often   
with tomatoes, so for the next 400 years or so, tomatoes   
were considered poisonous.      

Lead cups were used to drink ale or whiskey. The combination   
would sometimes knock people out for a couple of days. Some-   
one walking along the road would take them for dead and   
prepare them for burial. The person would be laid out on the   
kitchen table for a couple of days and the family would   
gather around and wait to see if he or she would wake up -   
hence the custom of holding a ""wake.""  


Ew, ok I still cant get over the yearly bath thing. Thats just really nasty."

A:He sold his soul to Santa. 

ahahaha I dont know why I thought that was so amusing, but of course I did.

This week is going by so incredibly slowly. But at least no school tomorrow to go on a trip. And then half day. It sounds so short....only that its not.

Ug, I wish that for once in my life I could be good enough for my own damn mother, you know the one peson whos supossed to love you unconditionally. Im not sure if she got that memo though. Im always too stupid or too much of a whore or not presentable enough or too lazy or too much of any of that good stuff. Maybe shes not aware that perfect has such a high cost. O well, apparently I need to pay that cost. But what do I know? Im just a stupid whore remember? 

Im so sick of...shit. Just all of it. I mean, when youre stuck in a hole, do you reach up and shovel dirt into your eye instead of just grabbing onto a branch and simply pulling yourself out? Apparently not. Its not like I hold myself about that, but I dont thrive on it. I hate it so much.

O how I cant wait for the weekend."

"event","It's summer in Denmark! Not that the weather shows it...it's still 50's and 60's. The first week of May was gorgeous, it was sunny and it even hit 70! That was the week John was here, which is pretty excellent. The regatta in University Park was that week (where departments build and race boats with crazy themes- one team rode in on camels- and everyone sits outside drinking beer all day). But then there was a music festival all over downtown on the 12th, with lots of free concerts, but for that it was characteristically cool and rainy. But hey, I'm the kind of girl who has no problem wearing a sweatshirt to the beach, so I don't really mind that it's not hot (plus there's no A/C).

I've started going running on a regular basis. There is really no excuse not to since I'll have a lot of time on my hands- and especially since there is a paved bike/foot path system that starts right by my apartment, it goes next to the river and by marshes and woods. The problem is, after it rains, there are GIANT SLUGS that come out on the woodsy part...and the worst part is, I didn't even notice them until I was pretty fair down! Well to be fair, until that point they were pretty small and looked like twigs. But then there was a black one 4 inches long and yellow one that size, with a little shell so I guess it was a snail...but EWWW! At least it gave me plenty of energy running back to the main path. I love Aarhus, but I have finally found something here that I truly hate. :-P

Anyway, I have one 3-hour exam tomorrow and then no obligations. (Yes I know, my classes ended April 26th and the exam is now...I've had plenty of time to study, which is so strange for me, and now I just want to take the thing). I'm going to be a volunteer bartender at the Studenterhus, where there are concerts and international student night and things. You get some free drinks I guess, but the main motivation is just that it's something interesting to do and a way to meet some more people. I'll have slow shifts so I can learn- my first one is Sunday, we'll see how it goes. 

Also, I'm going to Amsterdam in June and *hopefully* Prague next week. Yay! And then I'm here until June 30th with nothing to do. And most of my friends will be here through June too (except Ania and Noemi- sniff) so there will be dinners and parties and whatnot. It's funny how much socializing revolves around cooking. Probably I will read and go to the beach and enjoy the city. And peruse my options for what to do with my life (I need to look at grad schools this summer before going back to OK- yikes). Right now the plan is teaching. 

Okay I think that's enough for now...I will try to update more, now that I will be finished with school. I hope everyone is having a fantastic start to their summer, and I'll see you in July or August!"

"event","SO, I walked into a pole today. It was pretty embarrassing but I don't think many people saw me. My hair was blowing in my face, I was messing witht he MP3 player, and yes...I generally don't pay that much attention where I'm going. But what was that pole doing in the middle of the sidewalk anyway? At least I don't have a black eye.

In other news, I am leaving for Easter break a week early...which means this Friday...and travelling for two weeks. I'm driving to Paris for the weekend with a French guy Titif and his roommates. Then I'm flying from there to Rome, where another of my friends, Davide, lives (a lot of European students are going home for break so I might as well go visit them). Then I'm going in a camper with him and 3 of his...friends? cousins? up through northern Italy. In Munich I hop out and explore there on my own for 5 days or so...I am staying in really social hostels so hopefully I will meet some people. And do some laundry and check email. Then I will go visit Rebecca Lamb in Hamburg! The train from Munich to Hamburg to Aarhus is super easy, and I still have 3 days on my rail pass to use. 

Yay I am excited! A little nervous...about the parts when I will be on my own...but one way or another I know I will find my way back here. The thing I'm most worried about it my flight from Paris to Rome- my layover in Torino is really short. Plus I have a feeling the airports won't have much English. Ah well, I will hope for the best. At least I learned my lesson from the Berlin trip and I am taking my phone card in case I have trouble finding the people I am supposed to meet. My Danish phone only works in Denmark- go figure.I don't even know exactly what I am going to see in these cities, it's pretty flexible, but I think that is the best way to do it.

Oh, also- I'm 21! Everyone joked with me that now I'm ""finally"" an adult in America (most of them are older than me anyway). On my birthday my roommate Anna made me a traditional Danish cake, and she and I made a sweet potato pie together, then she and my other roommate Anders took me out to dinner. Then we all had to go to bed because we ate too much. The Friday after I had a party in my little apartment, it was sort of St. Patrick's themed and we had green cocktails. It was a little crowded but it worked out fine, Franca and Clement even brought an ""American-style"" birthday cake. After we went dancing at an English pub...which you were supposed to be 23 to enter...but it's just for image so they don't really care as long as you don't look 16 I think.

That's it for now...I know I should update more often but things always get crazy. Hej-hej!"

"event","Next week I am faced with the challenge of making an ""American dinner"" for 12 people. My group of friends has this thing going where everybody hosts a dinner from their respective country- thus, we have had several Italian dinners, a French dinner, a Spanish dinner, and there is going to be a Dutch dinner, a Czech dinner, etc. It's really fun and a good alternative to going out every single night (well, we sometimes still go out in the city afterward, but...), and we get to try different food. Well, it's getting to be my turn, but American cuisine is not quite so straightforward as pasta or crepes or tortillas- since we tend to borrow our favorite foods from other cultures. So, my dad suggested fried chicken. The other issue is that we tend to eat at ""Italian dinner time"", meaning late, mostly because Italians have trouble with punctuality I think. But in order to have a dinner at ""American dinner time"" I am going to have to convince people to get there pretty early. Maybe we can eat in front of the tv. :-P  
    Now that I am settling in and getting the hang of Aarhus a little bit, I am getting antsy to plan trips to some other countries. I have never been ANYWHERE overseas except here, so I have a lot of catching up to do. But it's kind of complicated- the cheap flights only go to certain cities, during Easter break it is a lot more expensive, some places are too far to go during a regular weekend, people are hard to get organized, my Eurail pass is stuck in Kolding because Fedex is dumb, etc. Sigh. I am determined to make it happen but it might not be that simple. Still, there is plenty to do just in this city that I have not experienced yet, and in the spring or summer I can easily travel to other places in Denmark. And don't get me wrong, in no way am I bored- quite the opposite most of the time.
    Uh oh, I am late for movie night. Fortunately it's only like 5 minutes from here by bike- oh yeah, I learned to ride it! I will post again when I have time. I have also been posting pictures at www.picasaweb.google.com/kelseyamartin, and I have a collective album with my friends at www.picasaweb.google.com/iwantafork.

"event","Okay, so I have been in Arhus for...almost two weeks. In the beginning there were moments when all I wanted to do was go home, because being lost and confused all the time and speaking no Danish was not very much fun. But things are much better now. I still get lost and speak no Danish (which is an incredibly hard language to learn), but I've realized that the easiest way to get unlost is to ask people. Everybody here is really nice and for the most part understands my English. Plus, a lot of the exchange students are not so lucky as to speak fluent English, so it is even more difficult for them. I am registered and caught up in my classes (even though I missed the first lecture in all of them), and I have food. Phew.

Now I can start to appreciate how FUN this can be. I have 4-day weekends every week, which is good since I have been going out every day/night except for Wednesday (when I took a 4-hour nap). Even though drinks are really expensive in the city, a lot of the clubs/bars have no cover charge most of the time, so if you want to hear live music or go dancing then it's a great deal. If you want to get drunk, you're better off going to a private party or pre-gaming a lot (apparently pre-gaming AND after-gaming are huge, and often lead to a night that ends at 8am). I've been to one ""Danish-style"" party, and now I can see why Danes are known in Europe for their alcohol consumption. But at the party I also unexpectedly got invited to join a choir, so that's pretty exciting. And I've been to the art museum and had homemade Italian lasagna, and maybe today will go ice skating, with the group of international students that have quickly become my friends. It's ridiculously easy to meet people. 

Oh, and my apartment is great. I made French toast (which the French students of course have never heard of) for my Danish roommate...mmmm."

"event","Well, it's more of an ""inclement weather day"" since this is Oklahoma, but the point is we don't have school tomorrow (today?)!! I never thought this would happen. Even though it's been sleeting and thundering and the forecast for tomorrow is terrible, OU is known for very rarely cancelling class. Plus it barely snows here! The thing is though, there's the ice factor...and that is bad news. Plus this area is not really equipped to treat the roads efficiently. In any case, WOOO!

On the other hand, I'm a bit stressed so I can use the day off. I have my ethnomusicology original research paper (meaning field notes and interviews) to write and present. Plus I am trying to get all my study abroad stuff squared away...it's under control but there's still more to do. The hardest thing turns out to be getting 6 months worth of my prescription meds to take with me, it's quite a process. Then we have to pack up EVERYTHING during finals week so we can move out. And I've been trying to schedule my oral surgery for when I get home and figure out when to do Christmas shopping. And we have our big A Cappella concert Sunday, which means I have to work on memorization and such. 

I know I know, these things are to be expected this time of year. At least in a couple weeks I'll be home! (Whatever home means...I think I'm in transition between living in NH and living Boston, since when I come back from Denmark in the summer I'll be moving in with John in Boston).

Also, I'm excited about Christmas. It's going to be a way better winter than last year, I can tell."

"event","So it's official, I'm going to Denmark next semester. We (Hannah and I) found out on Monday. It's so weird that it's a reality now. I'm going to be taking mainly linguistics classes, so I can finish my minor. But the grades are based on one thing- generally some kind of paper or big test- at the end of the semester, that's it. But all we have to do is pass! Wow, what a change that is...but it's good because grading may be much more rigorous. But besides that, it will be like a vacation! Oh man. And the public transportation is so efficient there, it runs everywhere and all the time- so instead of being the oddball with no car, I'll be like everyone else! 

The weather started being more fall-like this week, which gets me in the fall spirit. John and I carved a pumpkin last weekend, which was really exciting, and my neighbor commented on our festiveness. Then my parents sent me a FANTASTIC Halloween package- with Halloween pot holders, fridge clips, a light-up pumpkin for the coffee table (AND batteries), a light-up fluffy pen, a creepy music CD, candy corn, and chocolate. It made me so excited for the season! And then I decided that we really ought to have some kind of Halloween party, and so Hannah and I are going to host a murder mystery dinner! It's a Honky Tonk Murder Mystery for 10 people. 

Sara and I went on an adventure last night to 23rd Street Piercing in OKC. The plan was for her to get her ears pierced so she could decide if she wanted to eventually pierce her nose too. But, the place was so professional and sterile and good- they use WAY better jewelry and procedures than retail stores, it's almost medical- that she decided to just go ahead and pierce her nose. Then I spontaneously decided to get a cartiledge piercing, which I have wanted ever since I got my 3rd holes."

"event","Today my friend (who may prefer to remain nameless, though I haven't asked her) and I decided to experiment with eating acorns. I was pretty sure I'd heard somewhere about people eating acorn soup or pancakes or something. But, as this was not a thoroughly planned out experiment but rather an idea that came to us while sitting under an oak tree, we decided to look it up and make sure they were edible first. They are indeed- but there is a bitter substance in them that can be extracted by boiling them a few times. Good thing we checked. The curious thing is that we weren't even hungry- in fact we were actually BURSTING from all-you-can-eat Thai food and could barely walk back to campus. But the acorns were just laying there, all over the place...so naturally our instinct was to try and eat them.

Anyway, we didn't boil them quite long enough due to time constraints but concluded that with proper preparation they would have a lot of potential. Especially in pancakes. But we would have to gather a lot more next time...when you harvest them from the ground in the south oval, half of them turn out to be black and unusable. So if you ever are craving a new legume, now you know."

"event","I'm restless. Just because you have a whole free day does not mean you should assume you will get all your homework done. For me, completing homework involves more than just the necessary amount of time...it also requires the appropriate conditions for me to be focused. And, well, I can only be focused for so long. So this morning I got stuff done, but then I wanted to DO something. And Hannah was gone all day as usual so I was here by myself (I will have to remember this for senior year, and hopefully live with/near more than one person. But I guess it is a good experience for me to get used to being by myself more). So I actually turned on the tv (GASP!)- generally I never watch tv unless someone else is already watching it. I don't know why turning it on takes so much motivation. At least I didn't have to trouble with channel surfing, since we only have movies and no cable yet.

Hannah and I decided we should have a party. But we need to decide what kind of theme or event we want it to be... which is closely related to who to invite. We have some diverse friends. We decided that a successful party always needs some kind of orientation- it can either be centered on alcohol, or something else. And since alcohol (especially since we are vetoing a keg party) would require a lot of funding on our part and alienate some of our good friends, we will probably need to have a more creative focus.

At least tomorrow will hopefully be more eventful. I'm supposed to do something with Casey, and also Monica and Sara. And needless to say, yesterday was eventful since evening games take up the whole day. I was actually grateful that it was rainy and cold- that's better than 115 degree weather, I say."

"event","This is how weekends should go. Friday I worked out enough to make me sore all over for the rest of the weekend. Then Friday night I saw Divinci Code for free in the union with Hannah, Monica, Rachel, Tina, and Jamie. Then we got free breakfast at Crossroads and chatted for a couple hours. 

Yesterday I caught up on sleep, did a little homework, played othello with John... and then last night I went to 2 parties with Rachel- the Delta Chi black and white party and the Ultimate skirts and ties party. They were very different, but we had a lot of fun! We met a bunch of people- well, boys- and ran into some we knew. It's funny that it took us till junior year to make it to any parties. I mean, I've been to a few APO parties but that's different because I'm IN APO. Anyway, Rachel and I decided we should hang out more and definitely go out again

Today I went to a new church with Lindsey. It was a methodist church, and it was really interesting. But she feels kind of so-so about it, so we'll probably church hop a bit. She might come to St. Thomas More with me next Sunday. Then, I got a bunch more reading done and made stir fry for dinner (which is a learning process...it'll be better next time). Tonight maybe I'll be productive a little more and then watch a movie or something, since chalking was cancelled."

"event","So Sunday our air conditioning stopped working. It had been over 100 degrees all week. At first it was slightly cooler in here- maybe only 85 or 90. But if you know me well, then you know that I get cranky and don't function well in the heat...so that made getting ready for school a challenge. That night I was almost too sweaty to sleep. 

BUT- thanks to management here being way more organized than at The Greens- it got fixed yesterday. I think I took it for granted, and now I have a new appreciation for air conditioners. Still, Hannah and I feel that it was an adventure/accomplishment to survive 24 hours of Oklahoma summer without the help of technology.

Also, we survived our first spider encounter. She said there was a ""huge spider"" in the tub, and since she is a Texan I assumed that meant...I dunno, the size of a grapefruit? But it wasn't so bad. We agreed that if I smooshed it she'd clean it up. And the ginormous crickets that come out downstairs at night....well, we decided to just ignore them, and maybe they'll spray for them eventually

All in all I love this apartment! My room is the master bedroom... there really is such thing as TOO MUCH space. At least if John comes to visit there'll be more than enough room."

So now I'm back in Norman in my fabulous townhouse. This place is perfect- it already felt like home when I walked in. Of course, the fact that Hannah had already had 10 days to give it nice little touches helped. I am going to be home alone a lot more this semester probably, and that will take some getting used to. But I have seen Monica two days out of two so far so that's heartening...plus the bus is pretty convenient, and APO stuff will be startinng up soon so I'll see people there. It's weird to think I'll probably only be living here for 4 months. Dude, you can't even get a thing of laundry detergent small enough for that amount of time.

I found out school starts Monday and not Tuesday. I guess that means I have to unpack a little faster. So...that's all the excitement for now.

Now I have a mini orientation thing tomorrow, and then 5 days until real orientation for my full time job starts. So much free time...and I don't know what to do with it. I don't have a big checklist of things to do this summer. I'd like to go to the beach or go camping, I think. Getting away from everything to read and hang out is pretty much the most relaxing thing I can think of.

Also, Saturday we checked out the FIRST mini-competition for a few minutes. It's weird because I basically don't know anyone anymore. And it felt weird to be there in a skirt, watching and not doing anything. But not really weird in a bad way... I mean, I'm done. I feel kind of alienated from that world now.

Wooo just one more week of substituting! It's an interesting job... it's not the teaching/kids part that I don't like, it's the part about showing up to do one job and then getting suddenly switched to one that is way more work. If I know ahead of time what I'm doing, no problem... but I get really irritable when I come in to be a paraeducator (teacher aid) and then end up in a different class, as the teacher. And have very little time to prepare for it, and much confusion. Plus I have pretty much exhausted my wardrobe of suitable clothes. I'm excited for the Salvation Army program, where I can where t-shirts and know what to expect and such.

I watched Casanova the other day. It was adequately funny, I thought. This was my favorite part:

[Throwing glove at Casanova] ""You've sullied my glove! I mean, love!""
[Casanova picks up glove] ""I haven't sullied it, it came out of nowhere!"" 

... and the rest of the scene I can't remember the wording. Well, you'll just have to take my word for it I guess. Or not."

In other news, I've been substituting a bunch lately at the Upper Elementary...as a secretary, para, even a teacher. I actually really like that age group and if I do end up teaching I think 5th grade or middle school could be fun. It's interesting though, because between my old teachers and my mom working there and my sister going to school there, a lot of people in the building already know me one way or another.

There's a fine, fine line between a lover and a friend;
There's a fine, fine line between reality and pretend;
And you never know 'til you reach the top if it was worth the uphill climb.

There's a fine, fine line between love
And a waste of time.

There's a fine, fine line between a fairy tale and a lie;
And there's a fine, fine line between ""You're wonderful"" and ""Goodbye.""
I guess if someone doesn't love you back it isn't such a crime,
But there's a fine, fine line between love
And a waste of your time.

And I don't have the time to waste on you anymore.
I don't think that you even know what you're looking for.
For my own sanity, I've got to close the door
And walk away...
Oh...

There's a fine, fine line between together and not
And there's a fine, fine line between what you wanted and what you got.
You gotta go after the things you want while you're still in your prime...

And a waste of time."

All in all I only slept for like an hour, but it was so worth it... unlike last summer, I wasn't entirely ready to go home. I was caught up in my friends and classes and... well, this really was a good semester overall. Plus we have fabulous plans for the fall.

Now don't think I wasn't looking forward to seeing my family and old friends- of course I was! But things are never quite that simple. Last night Elizabeth, Emily and I were up until 4am trying to contain the flooding in the basement. Oh, New Hampshire. When I first got home I was depressed for no reason--  the wintery-ish weather was throwing me back to winter break and all the crappy emotions that went with it. Which is bad, because I have come so far since then. But now that it's starting to sink in that this is summer and not winter I'm doing ok... there's nothin to get me down except the usual twists that being home for summer vacation can throw at you :-P"

* Toby came to visit. We made Easter eggs with Hannah and Monica! And I went to a casino for the first time. 

* Relay for Life! APO won the cross-dressing contest, with Andrew as our contestant. We went to bars all over Norman with him and panhandled for the American Cancer Society. 

* The Children's Theater performance that I am chair of is happening in less than 2 weeks! That means we have 3 more rehearsals, set and costumes to do, flyers to put up, etc...aaaah!

* We repainted a giant U.S. map at an elementary school. I felt better about my own poor geography skills when Andrew called one state ""North Virginia"", and whoever painted the map before us made the ocean go all the way around...what about Canada? Are we an island?

* Hannah and I bought a VCR and DVD player and acquired some free beds. Now we have a semi-plan for getting, moving, and storing furniture for next year

* I had barbecued hot dogs and hamburgers 3 days in a row at 3 different events...mmm summer

* Sara is getting married

* Conditions are favorable for tornadoes and there are warnings in OKC...what else is new

I also realized that not only am I living right near a grocery store in the fall, but there is also a SALVATION ARMY STORE in that plaza! EEEEEE! And a laundromat. Oh man, instead of doing my laundry at Cherrystone I can do it there and shop while I'm waiting! OR, if I don't get the undergraduate teaching assistant position (which would be freakin sweet, but had a really dumb application so I think they're selecting people via eeny meeny miny mo) then maybe I can work at the thrift store! Although I'm sure shopping there is way more fun than working there.

In older news, New York over spring break was awesome!! And Rent was amazing!! At one of the restaurants we went to there was like a bathroom attendant. She even squirted the soap on your hands...I didn't know what to do. And there were all these lotions and stuff in there you could use...even in the men's room apparently...

Ok obviously I could say a lot more about NY but probably most of you have been there, so that's it for now."

I think it's mainly because it was so nice outside today, and I got to study with my window open. :-) Plus, it wasn't reeeally studying, it was making a family history diagram. Which meant talking to both my parents, which is always nice. Then this afternoon Justin went jogging and unexpectedly showed up here, and we went for a walk.

However, I have to remind myself that at home it is not spring, and when we go to New York over spring break it is probably going to feel the way winter feels here. Oh well, it doesn't really matter cuz we're going to be in NEW YORK and seeing RENT on BROADWAY!"

But on another note, I got a letter from the Russian penpal I had in 6th or 7th grade. That's right, he lost my address and then after like 8 years he found it again and wants to keep writing. He says ""I very much regret that so has taken place also we for a long time any more did not correspond, but I frequently recollected acquaintance."" 

Last night Monica convinced me to come bowling at 10:00, despite having mad studying to do for my 2 tests today. It was AWESOME! Well, me and Monica's scores put together didn't even equal Andrew's or Justin's...but we had more team spirit! Oh man, I hadn't been bowling in so long.

Eeeee! I think the people at the study abroad fair sold me on Denmark. Hannah and I have already been planning to study abroad next spring, we just hadn't decided where to go yet. She was leaning toward Denmark, and now I think we are both pretty set on it. It sounds like they have a good selection of classes taught in English, are very accomodating to American exchange students, the city is the perfect size, it sounds like there's a great campus set-up, it's super easy to travel Europe from there (there's a train that shoots right to Berlin), it's not very cliche, and since we don't know much about the country we'd get a very genuine impression of it. 

Hmm, what else. Well Valentine's Day was really fun. Justin and I went to Ted's and had fabulous Mexican food (it's really well-known in OK but I'd never been there).

"event","So I was called in to sub today, which meant an entire day of GLORIOUSLY not dwelling on my life. Don't get me wrong, since Friday I've been feeling better- like a person again instead of an exploding ball of emotion. But getting a grip on myself didn't stop the depression from hovering around and periodically swooping in.

Therefore I have been trying to sleep a lot, because sleeping means less thinking about things. And sometimes fun dreams. But working with pre-schoolers left even less room for thinking about myself. Now, I didn't even know Reed's Ferry HAD pre-school- I mean NH didn't even used to have public kindergarten right? But there it was, and 3-4 year-olds require a ton of attention. And they are so cute! One kid made me baloney pizza out of play-do.

Anyway I know that pushing away painful thoughts about the past and future won't fix them. I have to confront them and accept everything the way it is, and I'm getting there. Oh man, I sound like a self-help book or something- sorry to anyone who expected more entertaining writing from me.

RIP Katie.
Hello gum surgery (not a major hinderance but not a buttload of fun either).
Hello recurring panic about having no direction in my life.
Goodbye John.


Everything hurt so much that I started getting stomach knots. And I have barely eaten in days (despite going running yesterday- wearing shorts in 20-something degree weather :-P). Probably that's why I kept blacking out this morning and couldn't drive Mommy to work. So if not eating isn't an indication of what a mess I am I don't know what is... :-/

But I know that things could be worse in many ways (although break's not over so who knows what else will happen...). And I know I have my family and a lot of incredible, invaluable friends.

"event","Today is the longest day ever! I dropped my mom off and got my hair cut and turned in my application to sub and filled out the paperwork but there is still TOO MUCH TIME leftover!! My plane landed at 12:00 last night, and normally is exciting to get home for a break, but this time I'm spending my first day home alone...in a house that I only sort of feel like I live in anymore. I know apartment life has spoiled me, but it's not just that- I feel like there's not really room for me and everything that comes with me. I know that's crazy since I DID live here for 13 years...but it feels like the household has shifted in my absence to fill in the hole, and now...I don't know where to put anything or find anything or what anybody's routines are. 

Don't get me wrong. I love visiting home and seeing my family, I miss them, but the key is VISITING... winter and summer are the hardest because that's when I have to wrap myself around LIVING here, and it's always hard at first because it's been so long and it's so different from school. And it's not like some of my friends' houses, where they come home to find everything exactly as they left it. Here I have to squeeze myself back into a situation that adjusted quite well to me being gone.

Aside from that, I just don't like being home alone, I never really have. It's lonely and boring. Even dicking around on the computer and doing chores and painting my toenails aren't sufficient to pass the time. But soon I'll probably be working some (for better or worse), and John will be home, and friends will be around. And Christmas will come! 

Good luck on finals for those of you who are still at school!"

We all got champagne flutes, which was exciting, but as an afterthought I realized that we don't know what we're going to drink out of them and they don't fit in the cupboard. In a way this makes them even more exciting. Practical is boring! Plus, at least we have a full set of them (we have only 3 wineglasses) :-)

Also End of the Year Bash was mad fun. We played a game where you had to stick a piece of string down through your shirt and pants, and then the next person did it, and so on until the whole team was connected. It was a race. My team had more people wearing tight pants AND we all managed to do it with our pants ON (unlike Eric on the other team), but somehow we still won. It's hard to imagine feeling violated by a piece of yarn, but when the next person's pulling on it and it's tickling/string-burning the length of your body... well, that's a bit awkward."

My roommates have started playing/singing Christmas songs, I have lights to put up in my room, we are going to get decorations and host a holiday dinner in our apartment, and I more or less know what I am getting for my friends here (the rest of my shopping, however, will have to wait till I get home, where I have more transportation and no sales tax!) Today is the Holiday Lights celebration in Burr park- mmm cocoa!

Unfortunately, this is also the time of year when everyone is falling apart. Well a lot of people anyway. The end of the semester, relationships, the weather, holiday planning, and goodness knows what else are making all kinds of people break down. This makes me inclined to fall apart too. The thing is, my life actually ISN'T falling apart right now... or at least that's what all logical evidence says... so really I just start imagining problems that probably don't exist. When people I care about lose faith in things, uncertainty creeps into my own perceptions, into places it doesn't belong. Then I have overanalytical, irrational, emotional thoughts. I want them to go away! That stupid little paranoid whisper of ""Maybe everything's not really  ok..."" is messing with me, and I just want to go back to KNOWING that everything IS gonna be ok- not perfect, of course, but ok- because that's the truth. And then I can be more helpful and supportive to my falling-apart friends instead of being a paranoid nutcase.

Well, at least recognizing that I'm being crazy is a big step toward rejecting those paranoid thoughts. If I tell you about them, just keep reminding me that they are unwarranted (like my mom did), and hopefully I'll be back to my normal stability soon. :-)"

Last night I went CAMPING with Monica, Cherith, Jamie, and Rachel! It was so so fun, and with the 5 of us nestled together in the tent it wasn't even cold. We had no success making a campfire...we had newspaper, timber, a log and two books of matches but we couldn't make a lasting fire. We should have quit while we were ahead and toasted marshmallows while we at least had coals...but we didn't, so we had cold s'mores. Oh well, we had fun trying. 

Then this morning we went horseback riding!! Trail riding at Lake Thunderbird...it was sooo much fun. Turns out they expect you to actually direct your horse a bit, which surprised me. And my horse, Banjo, DID respond...he even went off the trail when I asked him to. And we trotted! Whenever we could at least. 

THEN we won the homecoming game 37-30 with a touchdown in double overtime! Sure, it was against Baylor, but they have been doing way better recruiting than in the past and actually becoming competitive, and also it's our rebuilding year, so I don't think it's that embarrassing.

First of all, the main character's 18-year-old son got hit by a car and died. Her job dealt with organ donation in a hospital, but after donating her sons organs she couldn't handle it and went back to Barcelona where she came from. Then she meets this NUN who's pregnant by a transvestite- incidentally the SAME transvestite who fathered her own (now dead) son. Needless to say, this is pretty intense... fortunately we get to watch the rest tomorrow, and apparently things are going to get ""a lot more messed up"". 


And since I'm talking about Spanish, the other day I was sitting with Susie and Monica on the south oval and Shawn (my Spanish teacher) walked by and yelled ""Hey Kelsey!

1. I have a goldfish named Mackenzie who cost 29 cents but whom I am absurdly attached to. 

2. I'm afraid of spiders now but I wasn't when I was little

3. I often remember my dreams and they are sometimes unsettling. For example, sometimes people are the wrong gender in them.

4. I am getting back in touch with my faith by separating it from the doctrines of denomination. I really like St. John's for this reason- the services are much like what I grew up with, and I feel free to hold my own views.

5. I LOVE oatmeal raisin cookies.

6. Actually I love to eat in general- food is a major weakness for me.

7. Fall is my favorite season. The lack of proper autumn foliage is my one complaint about Oklahoma weather.

8. I can't make decisions for crap.

9. I enjoy playing racquetball. It's too bad I can't practice more, because then maybe I'd have a better shot at ever beating the guys I play with :-P Actually, I don't really care that I lose.

10. I hate mayonnaise. And mustard.

11. I am way more into the football games this year than I was last year. Which is funny, since we are having a way tougher season. I love Bomar!

12. This year is the first time in my entire life (that I can remember) that I have had my own room. If you don't count that time when we were little and Elizabeth moved out but moved back in because she hated being alone.

13. I love sociology but I don't really know what my career is going to be. But I have some ideas and that is enough for now.

14. When it really comes down to it, I love my family.

15. I'm a visual learner.

16. I love statistics. I used to just like math in general, but now I focus on statistics because it really really makes sense to me and plus it's the only kind of math I need for my major.

17. How about something I hate. Here's something: I hate confrontation. And I know that sometimes it is bad to keep things inside to avoid confrontation, but I usually let go of my anger pretty quickly whether I want to or not.

18. I'm sometimes self-conscious about about the weight I've gained. It doesn't consume my life or anything, it's just hard to face the reality that I'll never again be as skinny as I was in high school. Wah wah, I know...I realize that probably everyone feels this way.

19. I don't think I'm doing band this spring but I sort of feel guilty about it and I do miss playing my euphonium so I'm really conflicted.

20. I have the most amazing boyfriend that I could ask for.

But THEN Andrew called and ALSO wanted to play some racquetball and eat some food. So we got Brahm's ice cream and eventually met up with Justin, who had been running the stadium stairs in the meantime. I still hold that ice cream is a way better prelude to racquetball than running.

THEN, the three of us plus Matt and Hannah came swimming at The Greens at like 10:15. But the hot tub was lamely NOT hot for once, and it was unusually chilly out, so they kept jumping in the pool to make the hot tub feel hotter. Woo spontaneity...I should never assume I have no plans.

Then this morning APO went to the regional food bank and packed up 5,9008 meals for hurricane Katrina victims. I LOVE SERVICE! And the food bank even fed us."

I got my hair cut today...again. In case you didn't know, I cut it super short right before school...and now it is even shorter for easier spiking. Although on Sunday I managed to make it pretty spiky thanks to a hair dryer. But there's no way I'm blow drying it on a regular basis.

One of my goldfish is still alive (MacKenzie)! I guess that doesn't really surprise me, since MacKenzie was the one eating all the food and Marcus didn't get any. Poor Marcus. But I've changed the water diligently, so it wasn't my fault he died. I hope.

Last night I took a bath for the first time since like...6th grade? Susie does it all the time so I figured I'd give it a try. It actually was very relaxing, even though all of me can't fit in the water at once. We have a hot tub outside that is open till 11 pm, but...there's something nice about unchlorinated water and not having to shave."

"event","So as far as eating healthy goes, I need to throw out this weekend and start over. Haha- brownies and ice cream for dinner, then lots of pancakes for breakfast, then last night more brownies and a billion chips with velveeta. Oh well, I don't regret any of it. Especially not the chips...because I think they helped counteract those margaritas a little bit.

The party last night was really relaxed and fun. It should happen more often."

"event","Woo today is awesome because (in no particular order):

1) I got a fabulous package of food from my parents AND my paycheck in the mail today. This is the first time I've gotten mail since moving in :-)

2) I went to Journey with Cherith, which I have been wanting to do since last year. The music was good and it was an interesting (if a bit confusing) experience.

3) I am going to a real PARTY tonight! At HANNAH'S! (Well, her two male roomies are throwing it actually). She and Susie and I have our outfits all planned out, and we are going to sleep over. I'm stoked.

4)I'm going to see Crash at the dollar theater with Tina, Jamie, Susie, and Monica.



Yesterday, on the other hand was WAY WAY worse because:

1) We lost our first home game to TCU. TCU!! Ok I'm too upset to dwell on this.

2) It was 115 degrees in the stadium (but don't get me wrong...running the flag was AMAZING as always...what an adrenaline rush)

3) I had to ride my bike back from the stadium. I thought I would die.

4) We bought hair wax and tried it in my hair and it looked awesome. Unfortunately, it turns out that stuff is designed not to ever come out. So I washed it with cooking oil, Dr. Pepper, hot hair oil, and about 15 times with dish detergent between last night and this morning. I think the wax is finally gone but my hair is stripped to crap...so tonight I'm going to use Elmer's glue instead of wax because I know that washed out. :-P"

I got a free snowcone from the College Republicans today. I am not anywhere close to being Republican, but the sign didn't say I had to be, so I took their free food anyway. I only wish the College Democrats were more visible around campus.

I am going to college night liturgy at St. Thomas More tonight. I found someone who lives in Greens to give me a ride home- yay! I'm excited because they're going to sing fun contemporary music, and there'll be people my age of course. This is a good system I think. I'll go to the Episcopal curch on Sundays because it's comfortable, and the Catholic church on Wednesday nights sometimes because of the music and stuff. This is altogether way more church stuff than I did last semester, but maybe working for the salvation army this summer got me more interested in going. Or at least in singing. I dunno."

"event","So I'm back in Oklahoma. I love my apartment. At first I was worried that living off campus would mean I wouldn't see many people, but that isn't really the case. We've had a lot of power failures and air conditioning trouble (not fun in 97 degrees), and we locked ourselves out once, so we have gotten to know the maintenance man rather well. But it's ok because it should all be fixed soon and we are going to make him brownies. 

I like all my classes, although Spanish doesn't interest me as much as German and I get a little muddled because it's my 3rd foreign language. C'est la vie. But my professor for my 2 soc classes is awesome: ""How many of you have marijuana in your rooms? Ha, [if you're not raising your hand] then you're criminals AND liars. Hey do y'all still make the brownies? I remember the brownies."" His powerpoints are complete with sound effects and funny pictures. I'm excited that all the soc profs I have met so far have been great.

In other news, I went to an Episcopal church today and I really enjoyed it. The service was basically the same as I'm used to, but there are a lot of little differences, as in lifestyle beliefs, that make it more chill and more in line with my personal views. 

Adios!"

A summer routine has emerged. Work, frisbee twice a week, seeing John as much as possible on weekends, seeing friends whenever I can, being a slacker about working on my scrapbook. I'm busy, but it's ok... all in all better than sitting around. I am getting concerned about only having a month left though... because that means only 4 weekends. Although I am VERY excited about the apartment and seeing the sisterhood, I am nervous about changing out of summer mode and sad about not having enough time with John. It is the confused feeling that comes from being home for a long time. 

I had a dream last night that it was August 15 (the day before I leave) and I hadn't done anything to get ready, like send in my rent check and pack. I packed in a crazy hurry, and when I got to school I realized I hadn't brought many clothes (no underwear at all) or my computer. AND there were 3 guys still living in our apartment, who were supposed to move out, but then it seemed we might have to share it with them? It was very hectic and maybe that's what made me get nervous.

Ok, time to finally get some sleep....adios!

P.S. I do NOT like this weather one bit. I wish the humidity would ease up so I could breathe. Gah!"

I mean, I don't mind getting up and going every day, and I don't watch every second tick by on the clock. Salvation Army is SO GOOD to their employees, and such an awesome place in general. All the different ways that they help people are really...inspiring. I would love to work for them in a different (more educated) capacity someday.

Backing up, 4th of July was a good time. During the weekend John and I managed to see my relatives at camp and his relatives in Rhode Island. I loved RI...ocean, city, countryside...they've got everything. We played some awesome games of ultimate there and watched the fireworks. We stayed with his California relatives in their rental house and they were a lot of fun. We are definitely going to hang out with them when we go to California."

Sunday Rich called, and some spontaneous driving and Burger King-ing and movie seeing ensued. At one point I was practically sobbing from laughing so hard...at something about naming his car ""the tarrrrr"". As usual, I guess you had to be there. Ah Rich I've missed you so much!

The topic of long distance relationships has come up in some conversations, because some people wonder how it can possibly work. Here's what I've decided. To me, the time apart is worth it because I know how good I've got it and I'm not willing to lose that. Temptation's not a big issue because...well, if you already have exactly what you want, how could you seriously settle for anything else? Yeah, it's hard to miss someone every day, but I hafta admit it makes you stronger and forces you to develop as an individual. So, that's it. I love you John"

for the whole of last week,
i chose this 30mins time slot to intercede for a leader everyone respects.
today, this intercession ends.
we lost to the battle of cancer.
but we won the battle of death,
and it is a eternal victory for that matter.

and the clock continues ticking,
with a special meaning locked to that 30mins.

within a week, there were 2 deaths.
i am once again highlighted of human&#39;s mortality.
death is for sure, though uncertain.
we really ought to make the best use of the time we have,
especially since it is a gift."

i dunoo wad am i doing.
i dunoo wad am i here for.
i dunoo why i go school, do assignments or attend project meetings.

i dunoo why i am going leaders&#39; meeting, edge uc, net grp, edge, morning/evening service.
i dunoo why i am meeting friends and trying to be a friend to them.

i had alot of &#39;whys&#39; in the daily things i do in life.
and suddenly, i just don feel like doing anything.
yet day by day, i drag myself to continue what i am delegated to do.

&#39;responsibilities&#39; --&gt; scary word isnt it?

i think i am hanging on a thin thread
constantly wondering when it would break or..
if anyone would drop down another thread for me to hang on to.

actually, it&#39;s enough.&nbsp;
i am really tired of hanging.
i wanna stop hanging.&nbsp;
but when i spoke to leaders above me,
i was just told, to hang on, the season will pass.

but any idea how tough it is one me? to hang on alone?
i want my support.
although yes i am thankful for a few individuals,
who stopped giving me projects here and there.

yet this period, i realised..
being home is the best.
THE BEST.
my parents are not perfect.
but the love they gave me is perfect enough for me.
i love hanging out with them.
and recently, i just keep finding opportunities to go out with them.
marketing, meal times, groceries shopping.
WHATEVER, i will ask if i could go with them.

i feel so safe when i am with my parents.
i feel that i no longer need to put on the strong front.
it &#39;s as though, the tiny thread that i am hanging on disappears temporarily..
they obviously dunoo wad&#39;s going on in my life.
but, not sure why.. i felt supported.
SO SUPPORTED.

now, the thread still exist. i am hanging in mid-air.
i still find no meaning in all that i do.
but, i want to start finding meaning.
just.. where do i start?
where do i go?

Dear all 

Do remember to take care of yourself as you are an important tool in your work with people. So, pls do something by yourself, with yourself and for yourself this week so that you can be happy at the end of the day for being with yourself and that you can say, &quot;I am so glad that I have myself to accompany me and I am happy with it. Thank you ___ (your own name)&quot;. Some examples could be having a favourite meal with yourself so that you can enjoy your own company or going for a swim/ workout just so that you spend some time with yourself amidst your busy schedule. I will be asking you next week how's time with yourself alone and will be looking forward to hearing from you.

everyday, my 'dream boook'
gets filled with my dreams.
dreams that i want them to be fulfilled so badly.

slowly, i realised..
that they are no longer dreams,
but they became my worries..

this has to stop..
or, i will soon begin to hate my dreams..






that aside, i shared with esther lim that day
about my biggest and wildest dream
and understood that she had an almost similar one!!! =)
now i am reassured again of my purpose..
it will one day, come to pass.."

"event","Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
 Drifting throught the wind
 Wanting to start again
 
 Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
 Like a house of cards
 One blow from caving in
 
 Do you ever feel already buried deep
 Six feet under scream
 But no one seems to hear a thing
 
 Do you know that there's still a chance for you
 Cause there's a spark in you
 
 You just gotta ignite the light
 And let it shine
 Just own the night
 Like the Fourth of July
 
 Cause baby you're a firework
 Come on show 'em what your worth
 Make 'em go &quot;Oh, oh, oh!&quot;
 As you shoot across the sky-y-y
 
 Baby you're a firework
 Come on let your colors burst
 Make 'em go &quot;Oh, oh, oh!&quot;
 You're gunna leave 'em fallin' down-own-own
 
 You don't have to feel like a waste of space
 You're original, cannot be replaced
 If you only knew what the future holds
 After a hurricane comes a rainbow
 
 Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed
 So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
 Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
 And when it's time, you'll know"

"event","recently... i was brought back to the ground.
there has been way too many occasions
where i talked back,
where i argued,
where i threw tantrums..

again i say.
the Providence owes me nothing
while i owe the Providence much..
so what then are my behaviours like?
i am disgusted.

recently... i came across many
articles, readings and videos
that reminded me of You..
indeed, i am nothing but dust.
but still, You trust and yearn for me..

today, You even gave me an apple
and a note saying i am deeply loved by You..

how NOT can i be unmoved??!
HOW NOT TO??

God, it's time i come nearer to You..
i don wanna be that far away anymore.
i don wan others to have a misconception 
of me developing well when in actual fact
i am not. i am DEAD far.
i don wan to lie on the excuse that nobody
followed up on me and wad not that's why i am like that.

honestly.. i have thought of leaving many times..
but. how can i?
as much as i had tried.. i really find that Your love is
much better than life..

oh Lord.. please send me a mentor..
i really hate this feeling of dangling
in mid air..
i wan somebody to hold me tight.
who can teach me to release my inner self
and grooom me to be who You wan me to be.

Lord, i wan another encounter retreat.
not those that we already have at youth camp, edge or women's..
i want a few days off from the 'world' i am in,
stay somewhere where there is only You, my mentor and i
just purely concentrating on You...
like a 10-days retreat or something..
no games or anything..

mayb i should jus go to the mountains 
or mayb somebody's house to stay...&nbsp;

time to seek You&nbsp;diligently.

somebody help me please?"

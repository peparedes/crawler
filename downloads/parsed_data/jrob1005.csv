"event","As I drove the streets of Kensington in 2415 car today, I reluctantly switched the radio to 1060AM at around noon. Right on cue, I heard the words of another new President recite the Oath of Office as 42 other men ahead of him have. (Little &quot;FF&quot;: 44th President only 43rd person though) So much has been made of this day;&nbsp; as with any new President, there will be a place in history for this day. I listened to part of the &quot;one-for-the-history-books&quot; speech he gave after being sworn. He, and/or his speech writer, does a hell of a job.... but can he back it up? I'm aware people feel a certain kind of way about THIS President. I can only hope that he is half as good as some people make him out to be. This country, this city, and the citizens residing in it, are in a difficult spot. I'm glad one guy can inspire so many people (and have them buy as muc h as possible at the &quot;Obama store&quot;) but I feel like the inspirational talk is the same stuff you here from pastors in this country, it's the same stuff you here from a close friend that knows you're down. I don't want to hear prophetic speeches, I want to see something done. Obviously it's not gonna be overnight. So as I sit here today, after approx. twenty hours of continuous coverage of our President's day. Will it be a &quot;New Day&quot;? I've heard ton of talk from have and have-nots, insiders and out, black and white... but it's talk. Now's the time for our new President to begin to act. Relatively soon there should be a State of the Union address, if our President is going to stick to tradition (seems like he's a big fan of that). Outline what action you're going to take, I'll listen. I hope that January 2013 I can look back at this and say &quot;Wow, he's that good.&quot; I hope he can, because that's what I've been told to do... hope, change, new day. I'm fairly sure of this though, tomorrow I'm going to drive those same streets I drove today. I'm going to see the same junkies, and abandoned houses, and get the same &quot;person with a gun&quot; calls as I did today, and the day before. But I'll do my best to not give up hope, and we'll see what this guy everyone loves so much can do. Tomorrow is a New Day, right?"

"event","Is a joke..... Now I wouldn't say that the complete system is a joke, or that it's a such a mess everywhere else, because i don't know... but in Philadelphia it's abysmal. <br />The way, ideally, it's supposed to work is (extremely summarized);<br />-The people commit crime, it is or isn't seen or reported<br />-The police investigate, they do or don't make an arrest<br />-The DA reviews, they do or don't prosecute<br />-The judge hears the case, they do or don't convict<br />-The correction system holds, they do or don't see time served<br /><br />--- Below is basically a rant that even I am tired of as i am writing this lol however I will finish it ----<br /><br />People commit the crimes and I'll say for our part the police do their best to lock up the scumbags. Police on patrol do as much as possible to find out what happened and then act accordingly. However this is when some of the problems come into play for us; someone is shot and they tell us they don't know who shot them (understandably believable, but often not the case) or they have no idea where they even were. Many times the complainants are just as bad as the offenders. Either way we find out the info and take it to detectives. The detectives do their part (usually) and get more info and start the process of charging people. That file moves to the DA and ADAs and they head to court. The ADAs encounter even more problems at court even getting a case to trial. Many good cases get tossed or knocked down at the preliminary and that's if the complainant actually shows up. The ones they are able to move to the next court often go without all of the charges... That's what a prelim is for, but how a judge can agree to knock an aggravated assault where someone is stabbed to like a harassment is beyond me. Either way, it moves to a different court, defense and prosecution go through continuance after continuance and again, charges are dropped or after about the 3rd continuance the complainant gets sick of showing or the officer can't come and the case as whole gets dropped. If after all of that(and the offender hasn't already plead to a lessor charge) it moves to trial. It goes through trial and the judge decides to convict or not. When they actually convict, they often give minimum sentences or are just put on probation. The scumbags do their time, some getting parole. (which can and often should be revoked....never are) Finally they're released to start the process all over again.<br /><br />The Police arrest the criminals<br />The District Attorney charges the criminals<br />The Judges <strike>convict</strike> let the criminals go<br />The Correction system (when they actually get criminals)&nbsp; parole the criminals<br />The Criminals begin the cycle again.<br /><br />Question: Why are police, or anyone, being shot by people who have been arrested numerous times, or charged numerous times for things like guns, or aggravated assaults, or robberies etc?<br /><br />Answer: Because the judges whose job it is to put them away didn't. They gave them minimum sentences or put them on probation.  Then the correction system paroled them so they could be back on the street.<br /><br />You leave this city and get pulled over with weed in the car you will probably see more time in prison then if you killed somebody in front of city hall.<br />"

"event","Ok, so it's not that bad... 

Wednesdays and Saturdays are a blast because now I coach 4-5 year olds soccer! A guy from work's nephew joined Torresdale Boys Club soccer and he asked me to help coach. For a few weeks now I get to switch it up and do something much different from the day job (well night job). Cameron, Damien, Dana, Joey, John, Keira, Luke, Madison, Matthew, Molly, Nathan & Richie give you 12 different personalities, attitudes and, usually, 12 different ways to do something other than what you've asked them to do. It's fine though... just as they're trying to learn soccer, I'm trying to learn how to coach it. I played soccer in school and enjoyed it, so coaching it? No problem. We started off with the rules and the object of the game; do not use your hands, stay inside the lines, and shoot the ball in the net. Easy enough? At practice we warm up first then do drills and games we've concocted. The games are fun for the kids, my favorite being Cops and Robbers, go figure. Practice lasts a hour that goes by very quickly but they're learning little by little. The real fun comes when it's time for a game. With their red jerseys, black shorts and socks the kids are ready to play. Everyone wants to be goalie, which I thought was surprising. We position everyone where they should be on the field, even though after opening kick they group together. Each kid has something unique they bring to the team. Soccer is certainly not Cameron's calling, not because he's bad at soccer, I just think he'd be awesome at other things. Cameron likes to pick up the ball and throw it in the closest net. During practice he picks the ball up and rolls it towards the cones like a they're bowling pins. Needless to say his mom will be looking into basketball and bowling next year. Damien, my friend's nephew, jumps and skips around and makes a solid attempt to go after the ball. When he gets to it, however, he goes into slow motion and very obviously thinks about what he's going to do. Dana is anxious to get on the field but then loses interest very quickly. Joey would rather just have his mom hold him the whole game. Keira likes to be goalie, but is just hasn't learned she can move around in the net yet. Luke is always wondering why we are not playing with his ball. He's eager to play and do well but gets frustrated easily. He really likes dinosaurs and when things aren't going his way he roars at the other kids and puts his hands up like claws and he chases after the players instead of the ball. Madison has great potential and just needs to head towards the other team's net. Matthew just joined the team last week for his first game. Besides attacking the kids on the other team like they're football players he shows promise. Molly is our superstar; she did a soccer camp over the summer and it paid off. She's our best goalie and out on the field, slight conundrum. Nathan is mostly concerned with making sure his mom is watching him play, to the point where he's actually not playing at all. He runs the length of the field looking towards the sidelines. And last we have Richie. Rich's dad is a cop in the same district as me. Richie is extremely shy and his dad doesn't help. Big Rich threatens to take away video games and such if Richie doesn't participate. I understand Big Rich's motive behind it but he's just going about it the wrong way. Along with all of these cute and funny nuances each kids has, my time coaching is great! Everyone participates, everyone wants to volunteer and everyone wants to learn. Teaching these 12 little ones has been a new and unique experience for me. I hope I can really teach them something because they've already taught me so much."

I absolutely hate traffic! Of any kind. It may be that I drive for 8 hours a day when traffic is basically non-existent, but during the day it sucks! Another thing, lines at the supermarket... The rare times I go to the supermarket to get stuff for the apartment I'm reminded as to why I eat fast food every meal. The other day I go and pick up a few things and get in the express line. The lady in front has way more than 15 items, but that's fine. The cashier rings her up and forgets she has a bunch of coupons so goes for them. Then she pays, checks the receipt and proceeds to argue with the cashier about how she was charged 2 for $5 on her Ritz crackers and that they really should be four and some change. I understand if there was some huge difference but it's a couple of cents! 
I'd really like to be normal and cook at home (even if it's the same stuff) so I wasn't spending an absurd amount of money on fast food. The supermarket has a life of its own. Carts are like vehicles on the road, most people stay to the right, park their carts to the side as they explore the shelves. Coming to the end of an aisle you look both ways and give people the right of way. Strangely like wawa, people are courteous with letting people by and stuff, for the most part. You have people in there just grabbing something for dinner or the bbq later, and others are stacking the carts until they overflow using a couple hundred dollars; for either food for the month, or just a big family that'll need more at the end of the week. Kids with their parents, some wanting to be the helper and grab stuff on their mom's list, and others who want no part of it unless they see something they want... I was more of the latter. There's much more I could go into, but I have work shortly so I won't."

"event","It's been hmmm, 2 years, since my last post! ha. So I decided to post, more for me than you, if there is a you reading this. I still check livejournal almost everyday... usually finding nothing new, but still keeping it part of the routine. I figured mind as well see something new of my own.

Here's a short recap of my life since my last post.... 20th birthday, police academy, new friends, old friends, new car (that wasn't new at all), graduating - 24th district, more new friends, moving out - new apartment, another new car, 21st birthday, yet another new car (this time not by choice), 1 year in the district. And that brings us to now, basically. A couple changes... however, looking at old posts, one thing that has not changed has been my being up all night. 

Today, being up all night is not so much by choice. 2 years ago I loved being up all night, peace and quiet, no one around. Christmas is just a few months a way, and I time I enjoy. But there's nothing pleasant about being parked next to 95 alone on Christmas Eve night, barely hearing noise from one of the busiest interstates in the country. That's the extreme obviously. I love this job but I guess there negatives to everything.

I'm done for now, there's plenty more to talk about which I'll get to without waiting 2 years.

P.S. Tastykake's Witchy Treats.... quite possibly best things ever. Which reminds me, Halloween, I'll have to see what John wants to do this year for costumes."

We sing ourselves to sleep 
Watching the day lie down instead

Neither one can tell 
We seem difficult 
What we got is hard as hell 

A hundred thousand words could not quite explain 
So I walk you to your car And we can talk it out in the rain

You know what? I could discuss this situation, but as I start to think about it. Hopefully you know the situation, if not feel free to ask.

The problem is - the people that aren't reading things like this, that aren't turning on tv and listening, the people who don't give a damn anyway are the people committing the crimes... as much as the media is going to put out ""Murders in the city are up 8% compared to last year."" blah blah blah The people who are committing said murders aren't turning on channel 3,6,10,29,57, whatever channel it may be and trying to ""catch up"" on the state of our city, more to less the news in general.

WW III may be in front of us. That channel I mentioned, broke it down a little, and I agreed somewhat but also thought about it myself and realized: we're alone! <br /><br />I'm not going MUN style with this, just a simple look at it (my opinion): <br />&nbsp; Now I <strike>supported</strike>&nbsp;support the actions in Afghanistan and Iraq, I support a fight against terrorism (and basically anyone else that just wants to mess with us)..... but, the line has to be drawn somewhere.... I'm drawing the line (for me) here. I'll summarize my explaination for the last line.<br /><br />Israel has had a problem with Hezbollah, and pretty much every country around it for a while now. They've dealt with it the way they've dealt with it, and now they've escalated it's attack, which is fun... Throughout the UN and other countries and now more than ever they want to solve this problem (which won't happen anyway).<br />It's come to the point now, where as I said, this could potentially be a huge thing.<br />As I see it, it's the US &amp; Israel against everyone else.<br /><br />Bottom line: Unless something starts happening to the US directly; i.e. taking&nbsp;Americans hostage&nbsp;(and I'm sure you could&nbsp;get technical and say it's already happened) I think we should just stay out of it. I know we support Israel and blah blah, but guess what? This could be the beginning of the end unless we have a reason for other countries to support us... or just not oppose us."

Who remembers in grade school thinking that a demerit was the worst thing that could happen to you... or that when school was over every single kid had to be quiet and in a single line in order for the teacher to take the car line out of school. That you had to ask permission to throw a piece of trash out. Then high school comes around and you think, ""A demerit? That meant nothing, it's not on my 'permanent record' and even if it is, these people don't give two shits about it."" I worked my ass off in grade school so I could get into a good high school, and yea it helped me get a scholarship to Catholic school, but was a school not going to accept me because I 'just passed', no... you have to go to school either way, and for half of the kids that are in Judge are jokes. So you get put into a tracking system and are told that it can change based on your grades, so you want to try and do well but you find out trying hard means nothing if you want to be in the top of your class you have to be able to cheat the best. (At least in my experience at Judge).... Granted, Rich Price and a few others actually worked there asses off and got made fun for it, but half of our top 20 were regular alcoholics who could get the answers, cheat, and be 'in' with Killion and the like. Yea it sucked if you had to at Judge at 7am for JUG but unless you like blew up the school (which you would no longer be in school for anyway) or got suspended a ton of times, colleges aren't going to deny you acceptance... and chances are those kinds of kids are going after amazing school, or schools at all, anyway. Then they say ""Even though your seniors you still have to work to make sure you can secure the college you want."" If you get accepted, you're in... most, I said most, schools don't even look at your second half grades, and shit it's your senior year, enjoy yourself. Then I get to PSU and I think, JUG? wearing a id around your f-ing neck? They don't care if you show up late, they don't care if you show up at all. Kids listening to their i-pods, talking on their phones, talking in general.... you'd be crucified if this happened back at Judge. It's your responsibility to do the work and if you don't your grade will show it. How many people have thought and said ""Are we even going to need this stuff when we get out of school?"" I'm sure a lot of the stuff we need and use, but not all of it. I mean there's a lot of trivial bullshit that we worried and worry about, and it sucks that you don't figure that out until later, I guess it's better that way. Just something I thought about."

"event","So the weekend was good... great concert on Saturday then got ""FUCKED UP"" afterwards. Sunday was mummer's parade, then Eagles...a good, long day all around. Penn State won the Orange Bowl tonight whic was great.... I heard I failed out of there so I don't know if I can still root for them?? 

Actually, I decided after a bunch of things and just the fact that I don't feel like going back that I'm not going back to PSU this semester...I'm gonna apply for Temple for next year. 

And so for my New Years Resolution, I'm going to stop pretending and speak up, funny cause I usually do speak up anyway... So let's begin, I now no longer care to deal with 2 people, they can take a wild guess, but I'm tired of PRETENDING I care or actually like them, cause as of right now I don't. So take your ignorant, judgemental ways that you use in numerous fashions and stick them up your ass, I'm tired of people saying shit, and assuming shit and just being the fucked up people they are. Harsh? Yea it is, deal with it, get over your petty qualms and quit bitching. I don't want to hear complaints, which will (unless after reading this you shy away) eventually be on lj. When you put 0 effort in, you get 0 back.

I guess we'll see how well using lj causes somes problems, it works well for others.

The weekend was great! Glad to finally have some people visit... spent all weekend with the same people and still wanted more. 2 weeks until I'm back home, should be good stuff.
Tonight was Week 7 of bartending class, it's going well...
Cubby Bair (our instructor) got a call and as usual he had a student answer... it was his son Matt.... his son??? We (me and the guys I go with) thought he was the ultimate pimp, and he has a son.... actually 3. lol This followed:
Me - Cubby you have kids?
Cubby - Yea
Me - We thought you were a pimp.
Cubby - Huh?
Jared - What about all of your honeys, and dates?
Me - Yea, aren't you a pimp?
Cubby - I don't pimp it, I keep it for myself!

He then went on ""Look, what I use to do all night, now takes me all night to do""

You learn something new everyday huh? lol

"event","Outside of the Willard building a few times a week is the ""Willard Preacher"" Gary. He's some Orthodox Christian who talks about how everyone is going to hell unless the repent or something. I sat and listened today, as many others do going to and from class. 15 minutes before class he talked about college students and their wrong doings... and when I came back an hour later he was debating with listeners about evolution and science, I listened for another 45 minutes. I must say he had some good points with the stuff involving evolution, however, as I expected, it was great entertainment as well. I'll leave you with some quotes from Gary.

""Ya know, I get a lot of grief out here for telling people they're going to hell, but someone's got to do it.""

""Ya know most of us have parents..."" ??? 
""...some of them were decent parents who told you 'Do this, don't do this.' but God is better and he says 'Don't go out, get drunk and laid.""

""Getting Drunk and Laid"" Count - From when I started counting, about 15X's in 15 minutes

""Is it cause of the morals of MTV [that we go out, get drunk and laid], does God watch MTV?""

""America says fornicating and getting drunk is ok, then it's ok...because America says so!""

""A few years ago if you said homosexuals could get married [people] would think you're crazy, but now it's ok, because MTV says it's ok, so everybody jump on board.""

""Those of you who think Jesus was your favorite grandma and only had nice things to say better read the Gospel.""

And finally...

""Maybe we'll do a quick, or maybe not so quick ""Going to Hell"" reading... for you seniors, this is the Bible... you might have known what it was at one time. For you freshman, keep it in mind.""

Oh and for some who know what I'm talking about:

There was, and is a lot to think about and I kinda helped. I've been feeling so much lately; happy, excited, mad, sad, hurting, scared as all hell... nothing has been too consistent.

Anyway, I haven't updated in a while (I think). So this week was a pain in the ass.... Sunday got home from KAIROS (Which was a hell of a time, and I've got the videos to prove it, lol) I was hoping to do something Sunday night, being off and all, but to no avail. So I went to sleep at like 6pm, then monday we had play rehearsal (fun as always...the sarcasm just isnt conveyed too well). Tuesday was good ol' school again.... it sucked. Wednesday we had singing practice after school and I can't think of anything else that happened. Thursday Judge let out early for the ""blizzard"" to come...I get home sit around. O yea, I was supposed to take my driving test today (Friday) and so yesterday I sit at home looking at the snow fall, it gets to be around 3-4 inches and still snowing so I go online and cancel my test....move to this morning, the snow is pretty much gone!!! O yea, my permit expires today too!!! So now I have to take my permit test again, reschedule the driving test, and hope I pass!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Geeze, so after the 6 hours of what some call ""school"" we have rehearsal again... I didn't want to be there, I've had a cold since getting back from KAIROS, and I didn't really want to deal with people. I dealt with it and hoped to do something after. I sit here now after doing nothing since then, except almost get kicked out of my dad's. Let's talk about that shall we:
So I go to my dad's every other weekend, being 18 however, I don't have to go ever...I usually go every other weekend anyway. My dad tells me he has something to do tomorrow and won't be home so I told him I would just come over tonight.... I go over eat and sit down. Somehow President Bush gets brought up.... o yea, cause I called my grandmom ""CNN"" cause she always watches it and then tells us stories she's just watched. Anyway, my psycho bitch ""step-mom"" starts saying how I like that ""idiot"" Bush, I then get into it with her about it, then ""CNN"" gets into it and why she is democrat. I make remarks to them about why they are wrong and apparently I made a face at one point. My stepmom goes ""don't get cocky with your grandmom""... I wasn't even talking to her but somehow I was getting cocky with her. I said I wasn't, she said ""yea ok"" and then said something to my dad about me, I said something to her, she made a face and goes ""I was talking to your father!"" and I said ""I don't care"" she gets up and starts to leave out of anger, while leaving she goes ""Jim's 18, he's old enough to get hit"" so I reply ""Go ahead,(in the Starsky & Hutch voice) Do it! Do it!"" I think she knows what would happen if she actually touched me though, so she yells ""that's it, take him home!"" to my dad. She goes upstairs and cries probably, complains to my dad and has him call my mom, my mom doesn't care cause she knows my stepmom is half-retarded and just starts with me. Anyway, while she's upstairs complaining to my dad, my brother informs me that before I even got there my stepmom said ""Jim's old enough now that we can kick him out of the house"" (yea she definitely wasn't planning anything). So my dad came downstairs, tried talking to me, I acted like I was listening, then got my stuff and left. I walked home, of course stopping at Wawa for a slurpee (actually icee, whatever)... so I'm good now. Except I want to do something tomorrow, like play poker, or drink ""soda""."

I mean c'mon, Will Smith is in it. This week has been sweet (Judge sweet, not ""awww, how sweet""-sweet) Rehearsals have been...well rehearsal. Tonight was the open house, pretty fun time explaining to people everything about the school and why you ""like"" it. Tomorrow I'm going on Kairos until Sunday afternoon. I should have a chance to relax and think about things, and believe me, there is quite a bit to think about. Monday we're off so don't have to worry about that. Well have a great weekend everyone, I suspect I will... hopefully."

"event","and they're sleeping over my house....
My sister practically lives at her friends' house. She goes to their house from school, she sleeps over, and she goes to school from their house. Occasionally she decides to come home and say hello (mind you, my sister is 12!).... Anyway she comes in tonight with her 3 friends who she stays with. They're 3 sisters in grades 2, 4,& 6. Now I've met these girls before and they didn't seem so bad (probably because I never talked to them or anything). These girls each have cell phones (a 2nd grader with a cell phone!), and are completely spoiled...probably one of the reasons they can watch my sis all of the time. So anyway, they are sleeping over here tonight. My mom left with a friend to pick up someone, so me and my bro are stuck with my sis and her friends. My sister immediately goes into the bathroom to take a shower..I have no clue why. So the 3 girls come into my room after being told not to. They start jumping on my bed, stealing my wallet, eating my tootsie rolls, and spraying stuff all over. My bro sits there in astonishment as they go through everything while I'm there yelling random (and not so random) things. They go downstairs and start doing back flips in the dining room, then come back up and decide to sit in my seat I was sitting in, and the oldest one starts hitting me...I ""moved"" her to the other side of the room and she starts screaming at the top of her lungs ""I'm calling my dad! You hit me!"" This goes on for about 20 minutes as I yell ""How do your parents deal with you!!"", ""You're all going to hell!!"", and other things which I won't repeat. My solution, I picked each one up, one-by-one and put them in the hallway outside my room, then closed the door.... they obviously opened it so I then threatened my sister with the possibility of being thrown down the stairs if she didn't get out of the tub. The whole time my bro laughed. My sis finally got out of the tub, I yelled some more, and they are now watching tv.   Geeze I need some pills!!!! And being sick on top of it doesn't help!"

Well back to the quote, I finally got up and moved around, my bro came over for the weekend. I had to get a bunch of info for college. I asked my mom what her social secuirty number was for the FAFSA form, she tells me and then says ""You better be using it just for that."" So I start saying stuff and my bro continues to say ""Jim, get off that credit card site."" Either way, they kept pissing me off so I said that and went to wawa. That was the highlight of my night (going to wawa that is), it was pretty nice out at like 11:30."

Tomorrow is the Wing Bowl which should be exciting (plus we get done early). Thursday the seniors get to dress up in 60's & 70's clothes which should definitely be a site to see and then Friday we're not in until 8:45 and we get out around 12:30. Super Bowl this weekend!!!! NOt entirely sure what will be happening yet....but I'm sure friends and a trip to Cottman & Frankford will be involved (assuming the Eagles win).

The priest celebrating the mass today was Sales's Principle, his homily was quite long and included mention of Prof, Zarreke, and some others... now Prof told us yesterday that the priest uses his lines all of the time...and today when we see him after mass he goes ""See, what did I tell you? You thought I was lying, didn't ya?"" No one really said anything except for the ""I bet you paid him!"" callout....Prof then responded ""No, actually me and Zarreke double-teamed him before mass."" lol The class broke into laughter for a minute or so and Prof had absolutely no clue why we were laughing. So rehearsal is in like an hour, then the Naz dance is tonight."

Even before getting it I considered the option of going (because I was originally pulling to go to Temple). I don't think it would be that bad up there (well obviously, but I mean with the distance and whatnot). But now that I've gotten it, I'm thinking of not even applying to Temple, and going. Sorry Bob, there goes our ingenious rooming plan. Now it's not definite that I'm going (although I've already started to fill out the paperwork lol)... I guess I'll think about it some more and weigh my options.... but at least I don't have to worry about be accepted to a college now."

I had this crazy dream which I won't get into, but I didn't even finish it...that's because I woke up by myself. I usually will wake up around 5-5:30am and then just go back to sleep, but today I woke up at 7:55 (and this is where I start to lose it). I usually get up at 6:50 and then leave the house at 7. Today I wake up on my own and see that it is 7:55, yet the whole time I'm thinking to myself ""Ok, I got up 5 minutes late, no problem"" I continue my routine and head out...not until I pass Captian's Choice with there electronic sign saying ""8:16"" do I realize that I've woke up an hour and five mintues late, and in effect missed half of my first period. I contemplated getting off and going back home but there is too much to be done in and after school to miss. So now I get off the bus and figure I'm already so late not much will happen, and I take my time up the hill. I get in and 2nd period has already started. I get my late pass and father says ""You just missed the cut-off, you have 3 days of j.u.g. instead of 2."" Wonderful! But then I got a break because he said I'm not late often and only gave me 2 days. I fell asleep in almost every class except for lunch, and that was only because I had to work off one of my days. I have 10 hours of community service due tomorrow, and I haven't started yet! lol I have a history test tomorrow on a book I haven't read, because I don't have it...and a 5 page paper due Monday. I considered not coming in tomorrow, but I have j.u.g. and Senior Class Picture thing too. 

Nahome, or however you spell it, asked Fr. Merchant today if we could do less work in the second half for psychology. (Mind you we have never had homework, fr. summarizes chapters in class, and the tests are given to us a week before we actually have them; we fill in the answers, review in class, memorize them, and then take the same, blank test haha)

I need to relax and get some sleep."

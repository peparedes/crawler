I still may make my list smaller at a later date - mainly through community cuts, I read way too many - so if you've been longing for an excuse to de-friend me without hurting my feelings or causing drama now's a really good time."

So I've started the laborious task of sorting through and trying to work out who I think won't mind, who I think no longer reads, who I will see IRL more than online, etc. 
If I remove you in the next few days and you think it's a mistake and you'd really like to keep reading my nonsense then please do comment on any of my public posts or drop me an email and I'll almost certainly add you back. :)
Don't worry, this isn't a begging post to be told how much I'm loved - I am feeling very loved as it is! - and no one needs to ask upfront to stay on. Unless you're feeling very insecure and would like to know I think you're brilliant! :)

"event","HAVE you forgotten yet?...
For the world's events have rumbled on since those gagged days,
Like traffic checked while at the crossing of city-ways:
And the haunted gap in your mind has filled with thoughts that flow
Like clouds in the lit heaven of life; and you're a man reprieved to go,
Taking your peaceful share of Time, with joy to spare.
But the past is just the same-and War's a bloody game...
Have you forgotten yet?...
Look down, and swear by the slain of the War that you'll never forget.

Do you remember the dark months you held the sector at Mametz--
The nights you watched and wired and dug and piled sandbags on parapets?
Do you remember the rats; and the stench
Of corpses rotting in front of the front-line trench-
And dawn coming, dirty-white, and chill with a hopeless rain?
Do you ever stop and ask, 'Is it all going to happen again?'

Do you remember that hour of din before the attack--
And the anger, the blind compassion that seized and shook you then
As you peered at the doomed and haggard faces of your men?
Do you remember the stretcher-cases lurching back
With dying eyes and lolling heads-those ashen-grey
Masks of the lads who once were keen and kind and gay?

Have you forgotten yet?...
Look up, and swear by the green of the spring that you'll never forget.

"event","I love my friends list. :)
Today I have two posts next to each other, one by an athiest, one by a devout orthodox Christian, both of whom I respect very much and both of whose posts made me smile, contemplate a different aspect of Easter, spring and how I personally interpret their place in the life/death cycle and that whole human condition thing going on there. :)

<lj-cut>
(to remind you - I have several filters I use for reading but simply to keep them in some kind of manageable reading size so I don't miss posts - I read them equally).

In meeting today I was... Challenged by the presence of a teenager in a very noisy manmade fabric coat. Couldn't keep still and the coat made plastic crinkly noises constantly. Kept reminding myself that I was as bad as a teenager. I used to sit and read during meeting. Usually appropriate works - Faith and practice, maybe a hymn book (I like to sing in my head), maybe the bible, maybe the book of quaker saints - but apparently it could be quite distracting when I turned the pages and the meeting sometimes wished I read a bit slower.
But I still can't somehow find peace with today. Maybe I just really needed the stillness. I'm feeling a little troubled. 

Sometimes it's a little bit lonely being a Christian Quaker. All the other Christians are doing various denominationally appropriate Eastery things today, and we don't have a ritual to mark the day. we don't 'do' ritual. Not all the other Quakers will note Easter as being particularly significant and those who do may chose not to mark out the day, with that whole every day being holy and so on. Ever feel like no one'll play with you? :)
Being a Quaker wasn't meant to be nice and neat though. We never take the easy route because we don't think it's necesarily the right route for us all. We don't do anything just to fit in with the rest of the church. Heck, we barely manage to fit in with each other's schedules! While it would be lovely to have a way to mark the rites and days of the church year sometimes I also appreciate that I can't fall back on someone else telling me what's important and what to do and where to be and how to feel. I have to take every spiritual path that makes sense to me, explore every single question that comes up and forge my own way when the paths don't go the way I need them to. I'll never be alone - my meeting will always cheer me on from the sidelines or walk with me if I need them- but I don't have the comfort of familiarity.

Some of the stricter quakers reject any ritual. In my life it has its place but must be kept firmly in that place lest I fall back on plattitudes and stop thinking through my convictions every day. While ritual for the sake of ritual is a bad thing so is rejecting any form of it without considering your reasons.

So today I've eaten chocolate, having failed to get chocolate eggs, and I will eat egg for tea, I will note the spring and contemplate its meaning to me. I will continue to do so every year while it makes sense to me. I will continue to refuse the bread and wine in churches while partaking of them in everything I eat and drink (Mmm, God in raspberry beer!). I'll carry on going to Midnight Mass once a year and appreciating the magic and majesty of the moment and I'll carry on beating my own way through the bracken that is my very confused little quaking mind.
</lj-cut>

I'm considering starting a journal for the purpose of quaking in a duck like manner. Would anyone be interested in reading it?"

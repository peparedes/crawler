"event","<font face=""verdana""><font color=""steelblue"">lately ive been learning something very interesting about myself...its not really something new but its coming into its own now..im just not a nice person...im sarcastic, vindictive, mean sprited, controling and those are my good qualities...dont get me wrong, im not complaining...im actually starting to get used to the feelings og emptiness that i have...without those pesky emotions getting in the way i can be who i wanna be and do what i wanna do without caring what people think of me finally...maybe now i can just get up and escape the life i have now...its way too high school, people talking about what has no importance to them behind my back...if you ask me and i want you to know then ill tell you, other than that mind your business...deal, deal...ok bye"

"event","<font face=""verdana""><font color=""red"">im starting to get a little fed up...if i wanted a million people to know my business then i would have had a press conference of some sort or sent out a memo or something...but obviously i didnt do that and for good reasons...my business is my business and only I decide who knows about it...when i find out who started this whole rumor thing, they better run and thats all i have to say about that"

"event","<font face=""verdana""><font color=""0078e0"">so it's been an interesting couple of days...had a kidney stone on tuesday...woke up with some of the worst pain in my life and went to the emergency room...had an iv and some morphine and a cat scan only to find out that they couldnt find the stone...it magically vanished which i am ok with because passing it is so much worse a pain...then i went to work because i have way too much stuff to do there and no one else would do it for me so i had no choice...

yesterday i was nauseous all day and supposedly im running a fever even though my thermometer says i have a temp of 97.4 but i dont think it worked right ever anyway so who knows...i think im just dying slowly my body is just trying to off me...oh well, what can you do...

went to the movies last night to see the exorcist...lets just leave it at the movie is ""interesting""...not really scary except for a couple parts that make you jump...its more of an extremely gory movie...extremely gory...but i still had a good time because of the company i had...

time to go lay back down for a bit cuz i still feel a little sick...i know i should take it easy but i kinda wanna go shopping and buy myself something new...that usually makes me feel a little better...hopefully it does the trick"

"event","<font color=""00a0e0""><font face=""verdana"">ok, things are starting to get out of control and i can't help but think that it all could have been avoided if i wasn't such a big baby...maybe if i was different and people weren't scared to tell me things for fear that i would flip out and do something crazy...maybe if i didnt care so much about what certain people thought of me i could be able share my feelings without fear of them pulling away from me completely...maybe if i could turn back time i could fix it all...maybe if i wasn't in love things could be better"

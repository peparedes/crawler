"event","2) Write down the features you would need in a computer, including the applications you want, your budget, and so on. Consider how you plan to use the Internet. Then go to a Web site that helps you build and design your computer. 
 
I would like my laptop computer to have a 512 MB Ram memory and a 1.6 ghz intel pentium M processor 
so that it would be pretty fast, and I would prefer the memory size to be 40 gb for hard disk storage. My budget for my laptop would vary from $1200-1400. I would want a good video card incase I wanted to play video games. A wireless card would come in handy if I ever needed my laptop to connect to the internet. Some important applications I would need are microsoft office since I would need microsoft word and powerpoint. I might also need a good image manipulation software such as adobe photoshop and then I would need an operating system so that I can run the applications on my computer. I would most likely use the internet for researching items for school and possiably for buying stuff online which is mostly cheaper than buying the same stuff from stores. The last item I would need is a cd or dvd drive."

Darkness chokes my emotions
Your breath numbs my soul
Stand with me, by my side
Take my hand and lead the way
Out from the shadows and into the real world
Show me how to live a life owned by regret
My blood runs cold, lifeless in shame
Now is the time, to right the wrong
Inside my veins, poison words lie
Within a mind as guilty as yours
take what is left inside of me
I've no use for it
Stained with thoughts uncaring, open and let me in
(it spun my head when i thought you were talking to me, 
i guess i'm just a fool for thinking your thinking of me, 
and now, I press my fist to the pillows wishing it was your teeth)
Show your world, deceit
Let me live as you, Need not to feel
Emotions rain down
Drowned by innocence, thoughts escape me
Harsh words spit blindly and open paths of life
Take all that is me, a lifeless somber soul
Curse the day you wake as solace sets in
Darkness chokes my emotions
Your breath numbs my soul
Stand with me, by my side
Take my hand, and lead the way
Out from the shadows and into my world
(My soul is not for you to own)
I will not live life to see your face anymore.

"event","LOVE SONG FOR SOMEONE 

Staying home alone on a Friday
Flat on the floor looking back
On old love
Or lack thereof
After all the crushes are faded
And all my wishful thinking was wrong
I'm jaded
I hate it 
I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here 

Searching all my days just to find you
I'm not sure who I'm looking for
I'll know it
When I see you
Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom
Staying up all night just to write
A love song for no one 

I could have met you in a sandbox
I could have passed you on the sidewalk
Could I have missed my chance
And watched you walk away? 

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
You'll be so good
You'll be so good for me"

"event","""Everyone longs to give themselves completely to someone to have a deep soul relationship with another to be loved throughly and exclusively. But God to a Christian says, ""No; not until you are satisfied, fullfilled, and content with being loved by Me alone. Discovering that only in Me your satisfaction to be found will you be capable of the perfect human relationship that I have planned for you. You will never be united with another until you are united with Me exclusive of anyone or anything else. I want you to stop planning, stop wishing, and allow Me to give you the most thrilling plan existing. One that you cannot imagine. I want you too, to have the best. Please allow Me to bring it to you. You just keep watching Me, expecting the greatest things. Keep experiencing the satisfactionthat I am. Keep listening to and learning the things I tell you. You just wait, that's all. Don't be anxious. Don't worry. Don't look around at the things others have gotten or that I have given them. You just keep looking to Me, Or you will miss what I want to show you. And then, when you're ready, I'll surprise you with a love that's far more wonderful than any you would ever dream of. You see, until you are ready and until the one I have for you is ready (I am working, even at this moment to have you both ready at the same time.) Until you are both satisfied exclusively with Me, And the life I've prepared for you, you won't be able to experience the love that exemplifies your relationship with Me, and this is perfect love. And, dear one, I want you to have this most wonderful love, I want you to see in the flesh a picture fo your relationship with Me, and to enjoy materially and concretely, the everlasting union of beauty, perfection, and the love that I offer you with Myself. Know that I love you utterly. I am God. ""Believe it and Be satisfied."""

If you know me at all, you clearly know how I don't fall for guys very easily... (to say the least!) buuuuuuuut!!!!! with Brad I just feel something special. Something I guess I've never felt before. He is truely the best guy i've ever met. The first time I saw him I went weak in the knees. His smile is the hottest thing in the world,his deep voice, and buff arms are enough to make any girl melt! Not only is he supppppppper cute but he's a true gentleman. Ahhh! 

Anyway I hope everyone had a great weekend! Here's some silly pictures Brad sent me awhile ago when we first started going out.

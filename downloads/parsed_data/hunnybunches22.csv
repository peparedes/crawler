"event","I should be sleeping right about now, but I can't.  I have only three more days of work left and I'm not even going to be able to make it in on time tomorrow.  It seems as if this livejournal phase has ended, and myspace has taken over.  The only person that really updates religiously still appears to be matt.  Very impressive my friend :D  

Lets talk about college.  All I wanted was a cluster.  A F-ing cluster.  I drew pictures of it and everything.  Instead I got a dungeon.  The worst dorm on campus.  Mercer.  It's highly recommended that freshmen girls in particular switch immediately.  Let me give you a mental picture:
The room is a brick block.  Walls floor everything=brick.  The only windows are in the hallway.  Smallest rooms and closets on campus.  One coed bathroom every other floor of the 5 floor building.  I'm on 4, I don't have a bathroom.  Oldest, creepiest coldest building.  Laundry/microwave is in the creepy basement which has one overhead pull light and no windows.  You're two blocks away from anything else on campus...basically locked away in the woods.  One girl said that she forced herself to think of it as her castle after she couldn't get a switch just to make it through the year.  To be completely honest...I don't want to pay $30,000 to live in a horror movie all year.   Everyone said that no one wants to come visit you because you are so far away...and after a vote of 1,000 students, it came out last in every category except for quietest and least social...both of which it came in first.  I have my advising date this weekend, so hopefully I will go and see for myself and hopefully be able to do something about it if it is as bad as it sounds.  I can't believe I'm hating college already.  

Hmm...I had a pretty good day today.  I went to greg's neighbors party and it was pretty funny.  Greg was in charge of parking cars so I pretty much just rolled around in the grass while he made an attempt to get people to roll down their windows so he could tell them where to park their car.  His neighbor is seriously one of the weirdest people I've ever met.  Just yesterday when I pulled up to his house I saw eric(the neighbor)  coming down the street in just shorts pulling behind him an empty radio flyer(ya know, a little red wagon)  for no apparent reason.  It was just nuts!

Mmmmhhhh next topic: video games.  We got three new games for the 64 this weekend and I must say..WOW.  Game #1:  Mischief makers.  This game is awful.  Shake shake, shake shake.   Game #2:  some game with a demon on the front who's name I can't remember.  We cant find the memory pack, so this game isn't really fun.  It's pretty much just the same thing over and over again.  It is however, two player.  Major plus.  Game #3:  The awesome MEGAMAN!  wow.  I haven't had this much fun playing a game since vexx.  It's great.  Only right now we're stuck at this part and it's awful because we just can't beat it no matter what we do.  I'm sure we will eventually...It's just so hard!!!  Let me describe it.  There is a big boss machine and you have to shoot out his tires and then jump on his platform to shoot in the hatch all while bombs are being thrown at you and tanks are shooting at you and mechanical birds are blowing up on you.  Bottom line:  I love this game.  If you have a 64...buy it.  It was only $12 or something.  I love my 64.  

Alright it's bed time.  Duty calls tomorrow...but only for three more days! and then I'm off to seattle!!! I'm pretty sure I can make it!

"event","it's late, and I'm awake.  There's no better time than the middle of the night to update a livejournal.  Today was pretty crummy.  I don't know why, but nothing really seemed to be going my way.  I woke up to a call from Greg.  He had to drive around for his dad and wanted me to come.  I was excited so I jumped out of bed and got in the shower.  For some reason, it was nothing like I expected.  We couldn't find the last place we were supposed to go and it just got tense and kind of sucked at the end.  So I came home and watched sweet home alabama for the 80th time.  
We also don't have any food in our house.  I hate it when we're foodless.  My mom has been in the worst mood lately.  I can't wait for college.  Anyway, so then Greg and i watched beauty and the geek..the weirdest show ever.  Followed by a short trip which also didn't turn out as I had expected.  I think today is just one of those nights where I need to go to sleep, wake up, and pretend the whole day was a bad dream.  

Summer has been really odd.  No one seems to be themselves.  Alex, Natalie, Greg and I were supposed to have a Degrassi party tomorrow, but I don't know if that's going to happen.  I think I need to stop having expectations.  I guess I just had so many for this summer...potentially my last summer with high school friends...and it just is kind of turning into a dud.  I know I still have 3 months left...but I feel let down I guess.  Maybe I'm just in a depressed mood so everything seems bluer than it truly is.  

Greg and I had dinner at my dad's the other night and it turned out pretty well.  We showed him our pictures from the cruise(which was amazing by the way:D) and he showed us pictures from his china trip.  Everyone was civilized and had a good time.  It was also nice to have a full meal with familiar foods and what not.  Mom doesn't really cook anymore...and we NEVER have table dinners, so I  thoroughly enjoyed it.  His new girlfriend was there too.  At first, I didn't really like her, but she's growing on me.  REALLY high maintenance, and not at all who I would ever see my dad with, but she tries really hard and she's super nice.  

arg, I think I need to try and sleep.  tomorrow will be a better day, I'm sure of it.  more sun :D  I can't wait until my new harry potter book comes!!  no later than 7:00pm on saturday!! YIPPEE!!!

"event","Well, high school is over, and summer has begun.  I figured since I have all of this new found free time I would resurrect my old friend the live journal.    I told Cathy that I wouldn't, but I just can't help myself.  It's so much fun.  I leave for my cruise in 3 days.  3 DAYS!!!!!  I can't even believe it!  but I'm taking my computer with me so I'll be sure to make lots of updates about all of the cool things we see.  I can't believe that highschool is actually over either.  I think it just set in today.  It's nothing like I expected it to be.  Graduation was over so fast, and then the grad party flew by.  I just don't know.  Now it seems that there are all these new weird tensions that weren't there before.  A week ago I was just worrying about homework, getting signatures in my yearbook, making up PE miles, and which pair of my shoes were flattest with the most traction to insure an embarrassment free commencement ceremony.  Now I'm worrying about things like having to go to work, leaving all of my friends, going on trips to other countries without mommy and daddy, and what i'm going to eat for breakfast at 2:00pm.  Even though it's just another summer, it surly doesn't feel the same.  

I've found that in reading live journal posts like this one, which promises to be WAY too long, it's nice to have breaks every now and then.  This is one of those breaks.  There are about 20 million grad parties today, and all I want to do is sleep.  I don't see why people planned them all on the same day.  I mean, don't the people having the parties want to go to other people's parties too?  I know I don't feel like getting out of my sweats, but I love my friends, so I will.  Also,  there is no way that I can make it to everyone's today.  It's sad.  I have to pick the most important ones, or the ones closest together, and that really sucks.  I hate doing that.  I remember 2 years ago when all of my friends graduated and I went party hoppin and it was so much fun.  All of us non graduating kids just got in a car and ran around all day seeing people that I haven't really seen since.  I suppose I'm just afraid that this time it's real.  These people are my closest friends who I've known for like, 10 years.  I don't want to not see them ever ever again.

Everyone is talking about losing their innocents, and entering the real world, but I really don't think that graduation from high school symbolizes that at all.  I don't think that I've been a kid for quite some time now, although I try to revert back whenever I can, and I think that this summer is going to be crazy, and more childlike than any other.  Trying to cram as much in with everyone you care about before they're gone.  Also, I would, in no way call college the real world.  That my friends, is where we will lose our innocents.  High school was day care compared to what faces us ahead.  After that - college graduation.  That is the real entrance to the world.  That is when we are truly left to fend for ourselves.  We don't have our parents or a place to live.  We need to get a stable job and start to form our own lives.  Entering College will be nothing compared to those feelings of loss and confusion.

Lets recap the grad party:  We got there around 10:30, and went straight into the gym.  There I played the throw the basketball into the hoop game, and totally knocked over all of the beads.  She gave me some b/c she felt sorry for me.  Then we ended up in the casino-of course.  Greg and I played black jack for a while, but I was totally kicking their butts :D, so we stopped, and he went over to play poker while I went and played DDR with david.  Oh my was that just awful.  We have no rhythm  AT ALL!  not to mention I kept stepping back to hit that arrow and missing completely.  Then we would start to laugh and I just lost it.  Needless to say we did horribly.  After that I married James.  How fun.  Salness was the best minister ever.  Throughout the night I made a key chain with jessie and james, won 2 pairs of boxers and 2 flip flops at boxer bingo, burned my hands in tug-o-war. laughed hysterically at the hypnotizer, won $15 for Target, and stood in aw at the fireworks, half asleep.  Then I came home and slept on the couch because Amanda was taking up the whole bed. Then end

I think this was a pretty good welcome back post.  I'm pretty sure I have to go take a shower and be on my way...even though all I want to do is lay around and watch movies.  Doesn't it feel like a movie watching day?

"event","I know I haven't used this in about a million years, but this is a serious entry worth taking the time to read if you're one of my good friends.

This summer i've neglected everyone.  I haven't called people back or gone the extra mile to hang out with ANYONE.  Even the people I would consider my best friends.  I've been a shut in if you will.  the only thing that i've done since school got out is work, and sit at home in my room by myself.  I guess i've hung out w/ greg too....but when i'm not doing that, it's work, or being shut in.  I am SO sorry for the people I've hurt and friends I've lost and I hope that you aren't ready to chuck me out the door of a moving car on the highway.  This year a lot of things in my life have changed.  my parents got a divorce and tres and dad moved out, my mom lost her job and became addicted to her new boyfriend and in turn we lost any relationship we had, and I got the worst grades of my life and basically ruined everything.  We're selling our house not by choice and have no idea where we're going when someone decides to buy it or how we're going to afford to live there.  i stopped going to church regularly and hanging out with everyone and I jsut layed in bed doing nothing.  I guess none of this really caught up to me until summer started and I had time to think about it all.  Please forgive me for being such an awful friend.  I'm working really hard to try and make things better.  I suppose I just realized in the past week or so when I started seeing people again that i really messed up and need to fix myself.  I honestly am sorry....and I promise things will be better soon.  I don't really know waht to say...but I hope this helps as some sort of explanation of why I have sucked so badly recently."

"event","So.   Hey kids.  I have about a million fun stories to tell...but intead...I'm going to talk about something else.  Why isn't it summer?  ok.  now that that's done.  I feel like everyone is gone.  I used to hang out w/ all these people and now I see them like, once a month on a fun hang out basis.  I hate it.  Especially people I used to be really close to.  it's awful.  A good example of this is last night.  It was the parade and I called my friend to see if he was gonna go w/ me...since we've gone for the past two or three years together.. and he made plans w/ someone else.  Now, it wasn't just any someone else.  It was someone who has a boyfriend but he's still madly in love w/ her anyway and she uses him left and right b/cher actual boyfriend is a jerk off.  she just drags him around like those little duckies on a string that you played with when you were a kid.  it's the worst thing Ive ever seen.  and what makes it even more awful is that girls do this to him all the time and he doesnt even care.  he just neglects everyone else in his life for this one person who could care less about him and when he leaves they wont even sweat it except for maybe be upset that they have to find a new filler.  Meanwhile...all the people that care about him more than anything will be stuck wishing that they had more time w/ him b/c it seems like he just up and left with nothing in between....to be continued"

"event","Charley and I went to zebrahead tonight.  we got there late and only heard a few songs but it was amazing all the same.  larry paris let us in for $5 each instead of $15 b/c he and charley are buds and it was excellent.  I don't think the paris has ever seen that much action in it's life.  It actually cost us less then one of charley's shows there and it was zebrahead.  a real band.  anyway, so it was amazing and we were in the mosh pit but I was wearing flip flops so I had to get out b/c my feet kept getting stomped all over.  it was still amazingly cool though.  I'm really glad I went.  I don't care what anyone says about them, they still rock my socks. the whole band is pretty good looking too. that concert made my day 100000 times better.  

I hope it all works out...either way."

"event","This weekend has been one for the record books.  No joke my friends, no joke.  Lets start w/ thursday night.  Thursday my dear friends david and geoff stopped by in a rather intoxicated state, and we hung out all night and did crazy things and then david and I went to lost park and saw jeff, clair, jessica, and james.  it was wild.  Anyway, so I got home at about 12. 

Then friday, friday I went to districts for tennis instead of school.  it was so nice. I hung out w/ david and josh and geoff all day and we went out to treasure island for lunch and played cards and watched tennis.  it was good times. The West TV carnival was that day too so greg and I went and met natalie there and painted faces for a while.  I painted mr. meads daughters face! :-O.  Haha! I had no idea they went to west TV.  that means he must live by me.  anywho, so eventually greg had to go home and geoff and david came by and we tried to win a cake at the cakewalk but we couldn't, so ashley won one for us.  it was excellent. Then the 3 of us left and went back to my house and I gave david his amazing b~day present.  oh man, then the real adventure begins.  So we were going to go to the A&W/KFC out in hillsburro for dinner, so we drive all the way out there and it's closed and all they can give us is root beer floats.  we leave.  Geoff started driving on cornell away from where we needed to go and we just kept driving and driving and driving until we were out in the middle of nowhere by the hillsburro airport.  We had to be at westgate in about 30 minutes to make it to kill bill 2 and we still needed to get food.  It was just ridiculous.  So geoff drove about 50 all the way back to cedar hills blv and we made it to the theater with roughly 2 minutes to spare.  Unfortunetly we didn't have time to get food so we sucked it up and bought some there.  Then we watched the cinematic genus that is kill bill 2, and drove back to my house for some good ol partying fun.  I'm not quite sure what time david left, b/c I was pretty passed out on the couch, but geoffs parents called and made him come home right when we got to my house :(  

Saturday was crazy, but not AS crazy.  It was the day of southridges prom.  So I woke up around 12:45 and just kinda layed around trying to compose myself and then charley came over for a bit and we watched sweet home alabama haha.  yeah, so then he left and natalie came over and I started rushing around to get ready since I had put it off for so damn long.  We saw jesus on tv too!! ya know the son in frequency? yeah, that's jesus.  I couldn't handle it.  I used to think he was hot in that movie.  now I just feel dirty.  anyway, so burtness came and picked me up and we drove out to southridge land and made it to jasmines fashonably late.  It was fine b/c she really wasn't ready b/c this devil woman made her hair into a rats nest and she had to fix it. Then we all asembled ourselves into bretts car and took off for bestro 51.  man, funny things happened there. So we finally find it...and there's a place called the cheerful bar right next to it...so we go in thinking that that's where we're suppoed to go...and everyone looks at us like the bad guy that walks into the bar in the old western movies.  it was scary.  We walked out and found the REAL place and it was so nice! the chairs were huge arm squishy chairs and the food was amazing. we each probably had around 5 italian soda things...and they didn't charge us for any.  Not to mention the waiter was so funny.  It was good times for sure.  After dinner we drove around and got lost on our way to the melody ballroom and got there at about 9:30.  There were so many people and it was just crazy.  Jasmine was mad b/c no one would dance b/c she's so good and it intimidates us.  Instead alex and I went on a laugh about and walked around laughing at ugly/funnily dressed/bad dancing people.  It was wonderful.  That kid is my best friend.  It was good, b/c it's not our school, so we just acted retarded all night.  We wated to go up to someone and act like we knew them and be like, ""HEY! long time no see! how have you been? how's your family?"" but we couldn't find any good lone wonderers.  They didn't play a swing dancing song, so alex and I were forced to slow motion swing dance to the last song and it couldbe the coolest thing I've ever done.  Except I was pretty sure my dress was gonna fall off.  Afterwards we left and me, kyle, gross, burtness, brett, jasmine, and jason all went bowling in our formal wear and jasmine brett and I ate so much food it was rockin.  we're the best girls in town.  After bowling we all went back to alex's and watched movies and then at  6 in the morning I was so tired but I couldn't sleep so charley and I went back and slept in matts bed(thanks buddy!) and it was good b/c I was out cold and comfortable.  Gross came up and jumped on us at one point but it didn't wake me up at all.  I was supposed to go out to breakfast w/ brett and jasmine at 7ish but I was so tired and I don't even remember her coming in and waking me up or asking me if I still wanted to go or giving me a hug goodbye.  Then everyone left including the whole burtness family, except for me gross and jason and jason was still passed out on the floor so gross came and woke me up and we were gonna make breakfast but decided not to and jason drove us home.  Now I'm here, dead tired.  Zebrahead tonight! yippee!!"

"event","wow, life.  it's been so CrAzY lately.  Everyone is having such an awful time with everything.  We all need summer more than anything.  I've been thinking more than the law should allow recently.  Everyone's relationships just seem to be so bad and strained and awful right now.  No one is thinking clearly.  this includes myself.  I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.  I seem to be entering this depressive state in my head, but i'm keeping this postive outlook on everything for all the people around me so that they can make it through all this stupid shit they're going through.  I wish for once in my life i could decide what I want and have it work out for the best.  I don't think it's possible.  On a happier note, alex and I didn't get to see lost prophets or death cab, but we DID go to seiso de mayo and it was an excellent time. he also won ASB pres.  I'm glad things are going so well for him.  this weekend is gonna be so packed.

Friday-Troy w/ sarah after school, then stuff for david's birthday and such
Saturday-some sleep and prom at southridge
sunday-hw, work, church, and zebrahead concert

I hope I find some time to sleep in there.  anyway, it's mindnight and I need to go ponder aimlessly and work on david's b~day presant and do some hw.  g'night all!"

"event","I hate change.  I've really come to realize how awful I am at dealing with it.  I always just want to live in that little comfortable bubble where you're still suffering, but it's familiar suffering that I've come to know and love in my own way.  Stepping outside of the comfort bubble could open up a whole new pain that isn't anything like the old pain, only it is.  So the minute you work up the guts to jump off of the road already traveled, all you want is to push away the new road, and fly back to the old.  you try so hard to hold on as tightly as possible until your hands start to bleed but even that pain is better then the unfamiliar.  Every once in a while, a change comes along, and you welcome it, only it's so small that no one around you even notices because no one ever really looks close enough at anyone else.  But to you, to you it's life altering and earth shaking.  All you want is some recognition that you've accepted what's changed, and that this is a big step for you, but that's impossible.  Therefore, you get the new pain all over again.  This makes you hope and wish and pray that this is the last time that you have to change.  That it's all over and this will be your life forever, regardless of it's standings.  
Choices aren't so hot either.  you can never know which is the right one until you do it.  and what if you're forced to make a decision before you know all the facts and later you realize that the path chosen was the wrong one...only, you're not the only one involved so you hurt people that you love.  What if the new choice makes you miss old ones but there's nothing you can do to go back.  Choices are all just a game of what ifs."

We felt like the masked underclassmen.  Then we came back to my house and watched movies and ate all night.  it was too fun.  Now I'm dead tired and ready to crash.  Things started out really crazy and unorganized, but it all turned out well in the end.  Good night w/ good people.  I'm kinda sad I didn't get to dance w/ all the people I wanted to, but regardless, It was an exclennt time.  thanks greg.  You're the best."

"event","Gosh, I've never wanted summer more in my entire life.  Honestly.  I feel as if it's never going to be here.  I went prom dress shopping yesterday w/ natalie.  I got the prettiest dress.  I'm so excited.  I can't wait.  I have a feeling this dance is gonna be a good one.  I'm kinda sad charley's not going though.  I mean, it's his senior year and he's not going to his last prom.  It makes me unhappy.  I dunno, I've been thinking about when the seniors leave and it's gonna be so hard.  Especially charley.  We haven't really spent any time together recently and I kinda miss haning out w/ him.  I know a lot of people dislike him or whatever...but when it's just us hanging out he's really fun and I love being around him.  Now please, don't misconstrue this as a ""OMG I WANT CHARLEY BACK I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM!"" rant.  Because it's not even close to that.  I just like having him as a friend and I feel like we really aren't that anymore.  I guess it's just hitting harder since he'll be gone soon and all.  I dunno, I hate graduation.  Charley does this thing kinda like livejournal only different...myspace.  and he hates when people read it so I try not to...but I did last night, and he put me as one of his heros next to all these famous people.  I dunno, that's just really cool.  I wish we still hung out a lot.  He has all these new friends and so do I and I dunno, I guess he's trying to ""reinvent"" himself or something and I don't think he really wants me to be part of that.  Which is fine I guess....I just miss laughing at stupid things w/ him...or whatever.  ok, I'm done.  

Anywho...so today is gonna be a fun day.  I went to work this morning which was boring.  The best part was this little girl telling this other little boy that he could sleep in her bed.  It was SO funny.  Espcially since she had no idea why we were all laughing at her.  I love little kids.  After work I went to starbucks in hopes of seeing mama morgan, but she wasn't there :( so I got coffee that made me sick and went home.  At around 2ish probably sarah and I are gonna go get holes punched in us.  YaY for piercings!! woo.  Ha, yeah, then churchola which i'm quasi excited about.  ah yes, and guess what...it's edens birthday!!!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY FREAKOLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ok, so now that that's out of the way.  Yes, and i'm really hoping to see greg today too.  I feel like I haven't seen him in forever...when in all reality I just saw him friday...and tlaked to him yesterday.  I dunno, I've just been in the weirdest mood lately with things like that.  Ha well, it's off to do deathwork for me! suckage to school...I NEED SUMMER FOR MY LIFE!!  I'll update after church maybe"

"event","I could write every detail about my trip to eugene,  but that's not possible.  Mostly b/c james has sisters. HA, anyway, so eugene was really fun, and I met so many cool people.  Didn't sleep much, and that really made our roommates mad, but it was such a good time.  oh! ok, I will tell you about this.  So, singing...brian joo...destiny's child.  That's all you get.  it made my life.  Anywho, so I got home and I was so tired and happy to be there. I called natalie, b/c she said she wanted to have dinner...and I went and picked her up and then greg came too and it was fun just like old days before I left and it was good.  Then natalie had to leave b/c she had to go to family church time at everyone's favorite catholic home.  So greg and I watched the blazer game only I was really tired so I kept falling asleep.  Then he left and I went to bed....only on the couch, instaed of in my room.  So my mom came and woke me up and brought me to her room and told me she was setting her alarm clock so I could get up for call at 7:45 for good ol choir.  Problem #1...I had to BE THERE at 7:45...and she set her alarm for that time.  So I woke up late and started freaking out and got dressed and ready and everything and then ended up stuck in traffic to get there for 30 minutes and then waited another 20 just to get in the parking lot.  Yeah, needless to say I missed the first service and was late for the second but it's ok b/c we hadn't started singing yet.  anyway, so that went well and it was really fun but we were all really hot and our shoes were death but it's ok.  I wish we could do choir all the time.  It was really fun and nerve wracking goodness. CSI:JERUSALUM!  After church I drove natalie home and mom and I went out to lunch at our favorite place in vancouver for easter.  It was SOOO good!  Then I came home and went to gregs which was fun as always.  We walked up to catlin gable and saw these people shooting off rockets and we were waiting for it to hit us once but it never did.  :( ha. then we picked up natalie and went to my house to dye eggs.  They were so ugly. I love it.  Those two people are so amazing.  I wish I could be as cool as natalie and greg combined.  Anywho, so now I'm off to hang out w/ greg some more...b/c that's just what my life is, and I like it that way."

"event","What an updaterific weekend.  It's been really good times for the past few days.  Greg and I saw lady killers on friday and it was sooo bad it was funny.  honestly.  I really wanna meet the person who wrote it b/c it was just out of control!  Then we came back to my house and hung out and he was late getting home and in trouble so I went to his house on saturday to watch the g tech game...which I won by the way :D YAY GEORGIA TECH! yeah, so that was really fun.  we watched the game and went for a walk and then just sat outside and talked.  it was amazing.  Then mom came and got me and we went home to make some food but it really didn't turn out so well.  I talked to greg online until like 2...and then my clock switched to 3 and I was so confused b/c I didn't know it was spring forward time so I went to bed and mommy woke me up this morning w/ good foodalicious and I ate it and then went to davids.  That was some party.  We did some hw...kinda...then his dad made french toast and I ate it even though I wasn't hungry and it was really good.  We read some comics and talked and had a grand time.  Then we decided it was nice outside, so we got up and went to everyday, only we were pretty tired and didn't really feel like looking through all those CD's as we usually do.  I got a ben harper CD that's actually quite good and I'm pleased w/ it.  Then we went back to his house and sat outside in his front yard for forever and a day talking and it was wonderful.  It's so nice outside I love it.  Nothing could make this day bad.  I got some taco bell on the way home b/c I haven't eaten it in forever and my body was going through serious withdrawl.  It was nice to have it back in my system.  I came home, and talked to david for a bit more and now I'm really just avoiding doing hte mountains of hw I have.  I even skipped church to do it, but I can't focus at all.  My week is so packed.  it goes as follows:
Monday~school, homework, caregroup
Tuesday~School, homework, hot chocolate w/ david(possibly)
Wednesday~school, homework, PACK
Thursday-Saturday~EUGENE HERE WE COME!
Saturday~home, choir singingness for easter
Sunday~EASTER!  and more singing
Monday~goose.

"event","in an effort to avoid doing my internal assessment i'm going to update.  Yesterday charley woke me up at about 10 and it was good to see him.  then greg came over and we all ate breakfast and watched march MADNESS! ooo..and georgia tech won.  ooo baby that's one more bet down for me! I was pretty upset when alabama lost, but I guess this makes up for it.  anyway, so then charley left and greg and I just hung out and watched funny random things on tv and broke a lamp.  it was a great time.  I love that kid.  he really is amazing.  Then greg left and I did some hw and got ready for church and picked everyone up.  

Emily and I had to do chairs and oh man we're so bad at it.  I'm glad he gave us money b/c it was just awful.  ha, anyway, so church was ok.  we didn't really talk about much except for how the bible came to be and what not.  OH! but the cutest boys where there.  Natalie was mad at me, but they were so cute! I may have acted like a fool...but it's not as if i'm ever gonna see them again.  So I tell mandi about them, and she runs over to talk to them and then I go over when they leave and paul is like, ""hey, I'll introduce you, here they come!"" and I turn around and there he is.  So he says hi and I shake his hand and I say hi my name is kristin..what's yours? <remember, we're wearing nametags here> and he says, ""lost child, but you can call me LC.  right, so what's your real name? just call me LC.  yeah, it was insane.  One of his friends had a name tag on that said, ""beer is fun"" and the other said, ""What's your name?""  I liked that one the best b/c it really worked.  Needless to say they left in about 2 seconds after it was over and taht was the end of the chruch adventure of the day.  

After church me natalie emily brian james eden and sarah pile into my car and  head off to safeway for some food.  then we dropped eden off at home and go get our hammers for secret raid number 2.  since we had about 15 mintues before greg was to meet us, we decided to go get zena...so we did, and then we were off.  I drove down his street w/ my lights out agan and turned around and then james and I got out to walk up his driveway to get him and as we reached the end all the other people jumped out of the bushes and started attacking! ha! but if only we had known!! he was prepared!!!!!! he ran back in his house and came out w/ a water gun! man, hahaha but he didn't get anything except sarahs shoes.  which she was quite upset about.  it was amazing.  I couldn't believe it.  since he couldn't come out to play, we all decided to go to the park...where emily and I locked brian in a port~o~pottie but he got out and then put sarahs shoes in there.  poor shoes.  Eventually I dropped everyone off and emily andI talked some before we got to her house and then I came home.

When I got here, I was in a reall ybad mood for some reason and I was just so tired and cranky so I let roger out and he runs after some animal in the woods and I can hear them fighting and I was so mad b/c I couldn't get him to come back and my mom wasn't home yet and it was just a bad night.  Then charley stopped by on his way home from work and we talked a little and it made me feel better but I still wasn't in the best of moods so I just layed in bed until about 2. 

I woke up this morning, and I thought I was gonna get a lot done but wasn't that a joke.  I read that packet for the IA in history and then decided I needed to take a nap so I did, but cathy called and then right after that greg called and I talked to him for about 3 hours but taht was really good i guess.  Then I HAD to watch days so I did that and made food...and now  i'm roughly half way done w/ my IA and putting it off until after caregroup.  I know this isn't the best idea but I don't really feel like writing it anymore right now.  

I've decided I really need to figure out life for myself.  i'm not doing such a good job of it right now and because of that I think I'm hurting a lot of people.  I dont' do it intentionally...it just happens.  so if you fit in that category, i'm sorry.  i think just avoiding all these issues that are going on and saying ""oh, it'll get better on it's own"" is really only making things worse and I can feel that it's all about to hit the fan..so I really need some me time.  I know that's rediculous since I had all spring break, but I guess I just avoided everythign and lived in this little perfect world w/ my friends where nothing was wrong.  Welp, it back to reality for me kids! and it's gonna hit hard."

"event","in an effort to avoid doing my internal assessment i'm going to update.  Yesterday charley woke me up at about 10 and it was good to see him.  then greg came over and we all ate breakfast and watched march MADNESS! ooo..and georgia tech won.  ooo baby that's one more bet down for me! I was pretty upset when alabama lost, but I guess this makes up for it.  anyway, so then charley left and greg and I just hung out and watched funny random things on tv and broke a lamp.  it was a great time.  I love that kid.  he really is amazing.  Then greg left and I did some hw and got ready for church and picked everyone up.  Emily and I had to do chairs and oh man we're so bad at it.  I'm glad he gave us money b/c it was just awful.  ha, anyway, so church was ok.  we didn't really talk about much except for how the bible came to be and what not.  OH! but the cutest boys where there.  Natalie was mad at me, but they were so cute! I may have acted like a fool...but it's not as if i'm ever gonna see them again.  So I tell mandi about them, and she runs over to talk to them and then I go over when they leave and paul is like, ""hey, I'll introduce you, here they come!"" and I turn around and there he is.  So he says hi and I shake his hand and I say hi my name is kristin..what's yours? <remember, we're wearing nametags here> and he says, ""lost child, but you can call me LC.  right, so what's your real name? just call me LC.  yeah, it was insane.

"event","So, yesterday, wow.  what a day and a half it was.  and by day and a half I mean one day.  So, it started out like this.  I was sick.  headache of my life. greg calls, he too, is sick, only worse.  so we watch the alabama connecticut came over the phone and I lose.  yeah, talk about a sad moment in my life.  then we talk for a while and I go read that english book.  I must say that's one of the strangest endings I've ever read.  ha, ok anyway, so then emily and I decide we need to get out on the town so we stop by natalie's to take care of juliette and steal a goose spoon for greg since I guess the other goose we really wanted is in seattle.  then we go to gregs and for all the things he said about my room...MAN his is just as bad.  ha, anyway, so we left there...for now.

Emily and I headed to target and while there we looked at all these purses and I finally chose one and then we wanted candy...even though we said we wouldn't eat it anymore...and we got mini eggs and looked at room stuff and emily found all the price checker things.  After target we went to barns and nobel to get the case for christ for caregroup and we found these huge picture documentary books of the passion and we took them to read...in the children section...but then we decided maybe that wasn't a good place to read such a graphic book and left to get our natls!

We followed this one car all the way from sunset area to natalie's street..it was crazy! ha, so we get to natalie's and her family is home from seattle and happy and her mom informs me that we have 24 hours to return the geese....mwhahahahah so then we leave for tacos and wunderland! We get good food at taco bell before our next adventure...and then it happens.

Wunderland.  that place is amazing.  I think we spent our whole life savings at those games where you put the nickles in and hope that it pushes the other nickles off.  yeah, and we made 569 tickets off of it and decide that we'll get 3 of those blow up hammers.  I got looooooooooooney toons, emily got scooby, and natalie got hulk.  We couldn't DDR b/c the line was about 200000000000000 people long :( it was sad.  but they did have this ddr drum thing.  we were awful.  they game overed us before the game was even over! ha, so yeah, we get our hammers and leave for the car where we blow them up and spend a good 10 mintues hitting them all over the place to music.  

On the way home we get a genious idea.  we're going on a mission.  at my house we dress in all black...and emily gets a mardi gras mask taht's green and purple and has huge feathers...so just picture it.  Me, natalie, and emily...in black pants, black boots, and black hoodies..emily w/ a mask, and natalie and I w/ hats...driving around just dying for trouble.  We put on our pump up mission music...mulans I'll make a man out of you(of course!) and head to gregs w/ our hammers to get revenge for the geese.  I turn my lights out and park a little ways away from his house and we start our crawl up his driveway...at roughly 11:00pm.  We get up there, and emily goes in for a closer look but gets nothing, so i stand to see and there's someone at the computer right by the door, but we can't tell who...so we run back down the car and try and rethink a good strategy in the car.  then we decide to go back out and we get around the car on our way back to gregs room and we see that it's his dad so we go running full force back to the car in huge boots...and we weren't quiet.  mind you the whole time natalie's saying, ""guys, this is a bad idea, we should leave...I don't like being places I'm not supposed to at night when it's dark!"" So we get in the car and I do my best to turn around w/o lights on and get down his street and we go drop emily off and then natalie and I head to charley's.  The end.

Then at charley's, natalie and I hang out for a while and then charley says he needs to go to QFC and see if he's working so we drive there and I go in the out...and he gets SO Mad and it was funny...then we drive back to my house to get everyone's clothes and stuff and we drop emily's stuff off at her house and I go get gas since I'm running on empty and I drive over one of those middle of the road blockade things.  once again, charley is sooo angry and I laugh my head off b/c there's really no reason to get mad.  then we drop him off and natalie and I go to her house and sit in the driveway until like 1:15am planning out our future :)  it was wonderful.

THE END!"

"event","yesterday was one of the sunniest days I've ever seen in my entire life.  It felt like it was summer...only it wasn't, which is kinda depressing.  Natalie emily and I went to the park and had a real picnic! it was fun! and wendall joined us and they tried to teach em and I how to longboard.  It was sooo funny.  Emily can actually do it. today was supposed to be my day, but we'll see.  Then greg came, and we hung out at natalies for a while and then realized that we had to go start day 2 of disney so greg and I left and we dropped emily off on the way and started return of jafar.  Not was good as I remember from when I was a kid.  I really couldn't focus so I started coloring this jahovas witness thing.  it was funny.  Then mom came home so I started cleaning and greg left.  I actually got a lot done last night but I didn't get to go to caregroup :( my mom was out of control so I just stayed and cleaned my room.  It's ok though I guess b/c it really needed it.  I found about $4, play dough, countless ear rings, and a bag of jungle animals.  I thought it was a good trade off.  Now I just have to tackle the massive amount of laundry we have.  Oh yeah, and charley called last night from new york.  it was a pleasant surprise that I didn't expect.  He's visiting vassar today and I'm so jealous.  He said he'd take lots of picutres for me.  It's my dream school.  So I talked to him for a bit and then just cleaned more b/c I had this overpowering force of productivness hold my body captive.  Yeah, anyway, natalie and emily are coming over, and probably greg later...so yeah, HAVE A GOOD SPRING BREAK OF A DAY!"

BoboTheButterfly (10:48:26 PM): hey at least you didnt get hit on by mexicans
BoboTheButterfly (10:48:35 PM): he was clearly caucasion

Anyway, so last night I went to church.  It was ok.  Not the best church night and a lot of people were gone cuz it's spring break.  I had to set up chairs but I met this really cool little 8th grader and made $30 worth of youth bucks for houseboat.  Then after church we went to DQ and got lots of ice cream and onion rings and fries.  It was good. OOO and we went to safeway to get drink, b/c it's cheaper...and there was this family there...the boys all came in one huge car, and the girls all came in another huge car...and the boys went into the store and they all had on tucked in hawaiian shirts w/ kahkis that were too high and the same shoes..and their dad was in a suit...and when they came back out the boys got in the huge car and the dad walked over to the other huge car and gave the ""mom"" some of the stuff he got in there and kissed her and they got in their cars and drove away...the license plate said something along the lines of utah or idaho.  Emily actually got out of my car and walked around to get a closer look. it was incredible. Then we went home since it was getting late, and on my way to drop off natalie we spot a car we know :) and decided to do a driveby w/ a note, so we did.  It was fun.  hhhmmm...yeah, and then I went home too, and thought I wasn't very tired, but I was.  So I slept.  And now I'm up so early thatI don't know what to do w/ myself.  My brain forgot that it was spring break and woke me up at 9:15.  Actually.  I think it was this phone call we got that I didn't answer.  Man, who calls people at 9:15 during spring break?  Must kill.  It's such a nice day outside, I think I'll plant the ideas of a picnic in all my little neighborhood friends minds...so we can go...and have a picnic...YIPPEE!"

"event","Yesterday was a blast.  I woke up and talked to emily and we decided it should be a parque day.  So I called greg and she called natalie and then I headed down to the baylis residence.  It was mama bays birthday so I told her happy day, and then she gave me these yummy chocolate deals that I ate.  She also had this really cool pampered chief bottle opener thing.  It was mind boggling.  On my way down to emily's I saw this kid in his driveway just sitting on a couch w/ some chairs around him listening to music.  It was the strangest thing.  Anyway, so we walk to el parque and natalie arrives at about the same time we do, and then we sit on the swings for a while but it's really windy and not very much fun, so we decide to go to natalies since it's closest.  we made popcorn and had cookies and these tortilla bite things and decided to be trunk munkeys and have a talegate party in her car on her driveway...so we did.  It was fun only we had to hold the trunk up w/ a broom b/c it's broken..and I thought I was going to lose my head.  Then greg came and laughed at us in our food and trunkness.  After a while we decided to go to my house and emily had to go home so we drove back to the baylis place and I saw AJ!! yay! i'm glad he's home.  And I told daddy bay happy belated b~day and then greg saw all the wonders that is emily's room.  Ha, ok, here's where my story gets good.  We drop nat off at my house...and greg decides he's going to teach me how to drive his car...a stick.  So he does...and it was funny.  I didn't do so badly...I did get stuck on this hill though and I couldn't get up.  It scares me that the car rolls back so much.  I only stalled it really badly maybe twice.  I was too afraid that I would just break his car.  I've decided only one loop every other day until I get good enough.  Then we watched beauty and the beast which was excellent.  we ate mac and cheese too. tasty.  Then greg left and natalie and I fell asleep a little bit..and then alex gross called! my southridge pals! They stopped by and we went to wonderland! emily met us there and jasmine natalie emily and I played DDR only natls and I are so bad...but it was ok b/c it was fun.  Id idn't get hit on by mexicans this time, but there was this one guy who was really creepy and watching us play DDR and he told jasmine I was the one w/ the body.  Then I played ski ball for a while and used my tickets to get a mini pink flashlight. OOOHHH! and I got a black light star stuffed thing out of the impossible machines.  Yeah, it made my night.  Then jason drove us home and I came here...and went to bed....then I got up...and went to work...which was boring. and now I'm here...and its' too early for anyone I know to be awake....so I just have to wait...and wait....and wait...."

"event","So, yesterday.  What a day.  This is how it went:
1st-bio-man, ok so that test...while/after taking it I think, not that bad...now...probably really bad.  then alex tried to teach me math
3rd-math-Wow, ok so this test raped me like nothing I've ever seen in my entire life.
5th-anthro-I have a 2% and have to do all this work over break.  I can't wait
7th-history-History was a blast.  So mcguire says, ""alright, who wants pizza?"" so we all chip in a dollar or so and get a pizza and have pie and watch this civil war movie and really I jsut sit in the back and pass notes w/ cathy and talk to greg.  it was sooo fun.  I love history.  Too bad for all those stupid people who decided to skip! granted james and I have a ""skip 7th and go to taco bell and dollar tree before a break"" deal...but we decided against it b/c of this great party.  And it was great.

After school greg gave me a ride home and I get here and eat my frozen piece of keylime pie and then I fall asleep watching days.  I didn't even get to see the end damnnit!  Greg was supposed to call and wake me up at 4 so we could hang out and then go see the passion but you see..I didn't exactly wake up when he called.  Instead I woke up at 5:30 when mom called.  I called him and he was a little upset, but it was all ok b/c I took  the fastest shower of my life and got ready in like, 10 mintues and he came over and we waited for mom to get home so we could go and then we did.  I don't know what to say about the movie, so yeah, I'm not going to.  The second time was totally different.  Alex gross called while I was in the movie, and I called him when I got out and he wanted to go have a party of fun, and I really wanted to see those guys...but I could tell greg didn't want to..and I really didn't feel like a party after that movie.  So I think I'll do something w/ them today.  We ended up just coming back to my house and watching poker and some other funny things on TV.  It was good.  Anyway, now it's rediculously early to be awake.  and no one else is awake.  so I'm gonna go do something meaningless like watch TV."

"event","I guess I haven't really updated in a while, so here it goes.  Saturday I had to babysit, and that was actually more fun then I expected...but then the parents didn't come home in time so I missed my hair appointment which sucks.  Then I got a new phone! Yippee!! if anyone wants the number just ask.  it's so pretty and red and amazing.  Not to mention it rings batman :)  Then we had a family dinner for tres' birthday at red robin...yeah...HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRO!  I wish I wasn't poor so I could get him something cool, but yeah.  I'm sure I'll come up w/ something sooner or later.  After dinner greg came over.  That was so fun.  We watched these two awful movies and then I was really tired so I crashed.  I woke up rediculously early on sunday.  I have no idea why.  I didn't have to work or anything.  I went to taco bell w/ charley for lunch, which was ok I guess.  We just weren't clicking and kept pissing each other off, so I went home.  I hate fighting w/ him.  Then I saw the passion w/ emily natalie and sarah.  I can't really talk about it w/ many people yet.  All I can say really, and I'm sorry if this offends anyone, but it was kinda like a rollercoster.  Before I went in I was so scared, and then once you're there, you know that there's no turning back now, and you'll be glad you did it when it's over.  yeah, so that's what it was like.  Church was amazing too.  We went to safeway before hand and each got a 2 leter of soda and bread and cheese cake.  it was great.  Then we sang the whole time at church which was sooooo nice.  Afterwards I dropped kids off and we talked and it was good.  

School today was really a waste of time.  it was such a bad day that I could have done without.  
First period was awful b/c van patten said that I cheated on the evolution packet when I didn't, so I had to prove it and hten I got my blue X taken off thank goodness.  She swore that alex and I had the same answers...when we didn't
Second period we did ear training and dictation.  It was so boring and I was tired. 
Third period was awful.  I lost my mathbook and I have no idea where in the world it could be.  I left it in my locker, but it's not there now.  Yeah, if anyone sees a trig pre calc book w/ a green cover...give it to me, it's mine.  
Fourth period Loving yelled at me b/c I can't run, and because I was in the counciling office at the beginning of class.  He asked me if words such as ""duration"" were the kids of things used in the IB program.  I hate stupid people.
Fifth period sucked b/c alex was being a jerk.  Mr. must get sex army freak is really pissing me off lately.  I wish he was still as cool as he was.  when he was my best friend.  Now he's just mean
Sixth period was speeches...but I guess it was ok b/c joseph is funny, and greg is in that class, and david came to visit, which was kinda weird, but wahtever.
History is a waste of time.  I don't know why I go anymore.  McG wasn't in a great mood...and I wanted to shoot david.  Greg is too nice.  

Yeah, so that's my day in a nutshell.  I came home, watched days, slept, helped a friend, and then talked to greg for a few hours.  it was fun.  I think we're gonna go see the passion this weekend which sould be really interesting.  I wanna see how he reacts.  

Oh yeah, and the convention was a waste of time.  It only made me more behind in bio.  The best part of last week was park trips.


I have the nicest friend in the entire world. I have no idea where he came from, but it's amazing."

Ok so greg came over first..and we just hung out until eden and emily and sarah and nat came over and we watched animal alphabet and made mac and cheese and watched se7en...I hate taht movie so much.  Anyway, so then david called and asked if I wanted to go to the play and I said SURE PAL! So we went...it was incredible.  The play was funny and we had a good time...but afterwards...man...johnny limbo and the lugnuts.  It was the best time I've had in a long time.  It was sooo fun I can't even describe it in words.  We danced all night.   When we were walking to his car this guy came up to us and asked if we were going near st. v's...it was really strange.  I haven't had that much fun in forever.  Then I came home, and I called natalie..and I really wanted taco bell...but mom isn't home so I made a bagel instead.  Well, it's time for bed...which rhymes...and tomorrow is the big day! I'm excited and nervous!! g'night all and pray for another amazingly wonderfully fabulous day!"

"event","WOW! so I know the weekend isn't even over yet, but I have to update b/c so many wonderful things have happened already.  Ok so lets see, friday.  Greg came over after school and we watched some grease since he'd never seen in, and then since I felt badly for making him watch it I let him watch some poker and I was just confused the whole time.  THEN we watched the worst basketball game I've ever seen in my entire life.  I seriously don't understand how they get paid millions for that.  It was celtics vs raptors.  bad vs bad.  Man, so we made a bed that neither team would break 100 by the end.. and guess what, they didn't! I WIN! not that I really know what I win yet, but at least I win.  Anywho, so yeah, we went and played in the rain for a while until I was soaking wet so we went inside and natalie came and picked us up for friday frenzy.  We took greg home and headed to church.  We got there and talked to natalie's little sister for a bit and then danced around w/ some kids during the dance through the ages. Ha, there was this little boy standing up against the wall the whole time so I went up to him and asked him why he wasn't dancing and he said b/c he was waiting for a friend and I told him we could just dance right here and his friend would still be able to see him when he got there and then he could tell ALL his friends that he got to dance w/ a highschooler...but he said no, I was too old for him and ran away.  it was funny.  So natalie and I went back to dancing horribly and it was fun.  This little girl who musta been like 3 feet tall ahha could sing ALL the words to beasty boys intergalactic.  it was incredible.  Then we went to omsi to see pulse and the bus was SO loud.  I swear middleschool kids never shut up.  We got there and I sat w/ these annoying boys who kept telling steph and I not to make out.  Anywho, so I was really tired and kept drifting off during the movie so I have to go see it again.  It was really cold in there too I thought I was gonna die.  The bus ride back to church was awful too.  SO NOISY! nat and I tried to sleep but it didn't work . Then we got back to church and just sat there waiting for her dad to come get us.  What we thought was going to be a nice quit car ride home of sleep turned out to be middleschoolers everywhere screaming AGAIN b/c we had to take all  her sisters friends home.  I came home and just crashed.  I woke up yesterday morning and met charley natalie emily and eden at shari's for some food and that was fun b/c emily and I made our snowmen :)  I love emily more then life.  Anywho, so we left there and decided we wanted movies and icecream but first I called greg and told him I had his backpack and I was gonna go drop it off so I did..and he decided to come w/ us! YAY!  haha but the funny part is...he got his license, and was planning on driving over to get his bag and being like, ""look! look! I got it"" b/c I didn't know...and I just ruined it all b/c we're synched to the max.  At baskenrobbins they wouldn't let eden taste all 31 flavors.  We were dissapointed.  Greg got a huge thing of vanilla ice cream and then realized that we still had to go get a movie.  It was amazingly funny.  We went to hollywood and looked for 7 deadly sins..but they didn't have it so we tried to find another scary movie only after an hour we coudn't decide on one so we just picked this under the stairs one which turned out to be awful and so weird.  then everyone went home but emily and greg so emily and I made a cake and then greg left so we went to taco bell and skyline only everywhere you can park you can't see and wherever you can see you can't park. So we just parked and ate adn talked.  Then we decided to visit charley at QFC and i accidentally busted open this icecream thing but it's ok b/c charley just hid it in the back. emily showed some guy where to find cany snowcap deals.  After i dropped emily off greg came back over and we colored.  it was seroiusly the most fun i've ever had in my entire life.  I love that kid.  Then charley stopped by and we watched some tv and he stayed until I went to sleep since I can't fall asleep when no one is home.  Then this morning I woke up to charley who actually woke me up nicely for once...and he gave me my check from work! $106! woo hoo!! too bad it all goes to APC tickets.  Now I'm gonna go shower and alexx and I are gonna go downtown for this open casting call for a movie and then we're gonna go see the passion and then I'm gonna go to church.  I'll probably write about it more later!  HAVE A GOOD SUNDAY!!"

"event","What a day.  So I originally thought that it was going to be a nice homework filled peace day...but of course this cannot be.  I must warn you, this post will contain much ranting and raving, and if you don't want to hear it, close the window.  This is my damn livejournal and I'll say what I will.  

So my mom is really pissing me off.  I thought that when it was just us, it would be better..and trust me it is..but she's just as bad as my dad sometimes.  She thinks that just because she works she doesn't have to do anything around the house and that I should just clean all day...wait..what was her complaint about my dad? yeah, that's waht I thought.  Then she jsut thinks that she doesn't have to be on time to anywhere b/c gosh darnit she's working and she's the adult and blah blah blah.  Well ya know what, I'm damn tired of being late places and always stuck places because goodness knows where she is and heaven forbid she should turn on her cellphone.  I fucking hate cigarrettes..and I hate it even more when people choose to smoke wherever they damn well please w/ no respect or concern for those who would like to live a full life and are forced to breathe around them. 

Next, I'm tired of people testing my faith and bitching at me b/c I've changed.  Ya know, yes, I have..and for the better...what are you doing w/ your life? wasting it away w/ some drugs and alcohol. Yum, sounds like a good time.  And when you get into trouble and expect my shoulder to be here...you better think again.  I'm perfectly happy being able to remember what happened during the weekend.  I admit it wasn't always this way...but I've grown and moved on, how bout you?  I'm so sick and tired of worrying about people and trying to be there friend just to get thrown to the side for intoxicating substances. If you'd like an entire book about why I choose not to follow your path, just ask, i'd be more then willing to print you a copy.  

Some of my friends really suck. Ya know, if you have issues w/ me, talk to me, don't fuck around and talk behind my back about how dumb I am and how much you hate me and how I ""stole your dog"" or whatever the fuck it is you're pissed about.  If you talk to me, chances are you'll find what you think is wrong, and even if it isn't, we can get through it a lot faster, and waste a whole lot less energy then we would if you choose to fuck around and wait for me to blow up in your face about how sick and tired I am of you and how naive and selfish you are too.

My stupid dog ran away today for 2 hours while it was pouring.  I got tired of looking for him and had to ask the damn mailman if he'd seen him.  He came home.  I was pissed.  

Love isn't real.  It's something created by the movie industry to get girls to come to their shows and give them money.  Guys aren't capable of loving, and girls can't handle the thought of guys not being able to even though they don't really love either..they're just scared to death of going anywhere alone.  It just isn't so.  Don't get your hopes up and stop looking.  You can't find something that's not real.  Don't believe me...have YOU ever seen a unicorn...THAT FLIES! yeah that's what I thought.  

I got kissed by a 2 year old for finding his lego bike.  

Some southridge freshman thinks I'm hot and wont stop hitting on me.

I'm tired.

"event","long time no update.  Valentines day was uneventful.  Greg and I went and rented some movies and watched them and it was fun.  Charley and I were supposed to hang out, but he sucks.  Then sunday I went to work and then suck boy and i went to quiznos and borders.  My sandwich was good.  Then natls came over and we went to borders again and got some stuff and then hung out till church.  then we went to church and stayed for the movie which we chose not to watch and hung out in the hall and talked instead.  Man, james' brother is hot, Watch out, i'm goin after him! ahahah So then I woke up monday morning to james natalie and zena in my room...and james thought it would be hot to jump into a bed full of girls...so he did...only he bounced off and fell inbetween my bed and my tv and landed on a bowl...hahha what a good moment.  Don't worry james, I have since cleaned.  So we watched movies all day and greg came over too and it was fun.  We took all the blankets and pillows and such off of my bed and put them on the ground and made a huge~o bed of movie watching fun.  Later on greg and david came back for a bit and then they left b/c daniel stupidly gave them his car and they wanted to go drive around.  Then they left and I just kinda crashed after talking to greg for a while longer and playing some double solitaire.  then today I woke up and cleaned my room like crazy.  Then natalie came over and we baked a cake! yay! it was good tasting.  We went to practice which was good...pretty uneventful except for that I got to see people.  It feels like we haven't been to school in forever.  After practice sarah and I went to care group and it was amazingly fun.  I love all of them.  We talked about a lot of stuff that has been bothering us and it was good to get it off our chests.  I'm getting baptized next month and if anyone wants to come...just talk to me about it.  I'm really excited.  Charley came over for a while after I got home and we fought and watched some happy gilmore.  It was fun.  I really wish we could find a happy medium, but i've realized it's impossible.  He's only good for super snuggling from time to time! hahaha JUST KIDDING! I LOVE YOU!!! good thing he gave up reading this long ago.  I need cuddling to survive. breathe, eat or sleep too.  Man, it's my most favorite past time.  Anyway, I am SO tired and have enough hw to fill a large third world country to tackle tomorrow...plus nat and I are gonna hang out..soo g'night all, and I love you!"

"event","I forgot to update yesterday...so we're backtracking a little bit.  Nothing really happened at school until 7th period when I got a singing valentine from isaac koval.  it made my day.  he's such a nice kid.  Anywho, so then I got home and fell asleep.  I was supposed to be woken up by a call from charley around five...but he called 9 times and I slept through them all so he came over and woke me up and I got ready REALLY fast and we went to this concert at the tigard water district.  It was such a weird place.  The show was just in this normal room.  Anywho, so first was this girl band and it was ok...the guitar was always out of tune but I'll give them a break b/c they were really young, it was their first show, AND friday the 13th.  Next was the band we came to see, ever we fall.  They were really good except when they preform they're always turned around facing the drummer.  it was kinda weird.  I was waiting for one of them to shove the end of their guitar through the kick bass.  We left after them b/c the room was really hot and the next band didn't look so great.  I believe they were called...stu's....shus...yes, stus shus.  No thanks.  Charley dropped me off and I talked to mom and played this card game called pyramid for about 80 million hours and then I fell asleep.  It was the first day in years and years that I didn't have to set my alarm clock to get up in the morning.  That made me so happy! I got to sleep until noon! yay!  Now I'm just going to sit around and watch sappy movies and think about how much I hate valentines day.  Happy not two year anniversery charley!"

"event","Hmm...I don't really remember all that happened today.  In music theory mrs miller brought us donuts and coffee.  Then Cathy and I went to visit our freshman advisory but no one really payed attention to us.  Then we made people come w/ us to listen to this guy talk about the patriot act and he had the biggest, thickest glasses I've ever seen in my entire life.  That was the best part.  PE we had a sub so andrew quinn and I just sat in the hall the whole time and some big strong kid got hit in the eye during dodge ball.   He was crying.  It made me laugh.  lunch was alright.  I hung out w/ steph and danny.  We gave our presentation in 6th and that could have gone better. The best part of that was taking the quiz w/ greg and then drawing pictures on this piece of paper instead of listening.  We're good at drawing.  After school charley and I ditched mun and went to my house.  that was good but he got mad cuz I kinda made him late for work possibly.. I DIDN'T MEAN IT!! I'M SORRY!!! FORGIVE ME!!!  the concert tonight was ok.  We played better than I expected.   Josh gave a talk too that I hope gets through to people.  anywho, g'night, and I love you all!"

That was stolen from my dear buddy matt.  Thanks for the comment by the way.  I miss you kid.  Anyway, so I've decided that I'm only going to talk about the good parts of my day, and no longer dwell on all the awful that's going around.  It's not my problem.  So today after first period taylor and I left and we went to his house where his wonderfull mother wendy who I love made us breakfast.  it was so nice! Ty was there too..what a blast from the past.  Anyway, then we left and went to my house for a bit and then we went up to skyline and looked at the pretty view.  it was amazing.  I went into the cemetary too! I've decided it's ok just so long as it's not at night.  He didn't want to stay there though b/c he felt badly.  So we left and went to our DARE thing.  It was so fun! the kids were the cutest things ever.  It was so weird to be back there.  Everything is so small and different.  We were just remembering how those little kids used to be us!  We answered all their questions and then when out to recess w/ them and played wall ball! YIPPEE!! it was amazing.  I  haven't talked to Casey in a long time so I really liked it.  It was elementary school all over again!  All the littleuns gave us hugs and then taylor and I sat in the office looking at the books w/ old class pictures in them for a while and then we went to jamba juice! YUM! Then he took me home and I fell asleep until I had to go to work where we watched veggie tails which is always fun.  Kimmie Sloop was there too and she's the nicest mom and the only one I don't mind volunteering to work.  She's actually normal.  We had a good time.  After work mom and I went to get some food and talked for a while about all that is going on so taht was good.  It didn't really make me feel better, but it made me realize a lot of things that I didn't before.  I can't wait for this weekend.  5 days off is a must.  Seriously...I might die without the break.  Anywho, I have to go read some more spirits b/c mrs kobrowski is rediculous.  Tomorrow I get to visit my freshman advisory! Yay natalie! g'night everyone! **pray for things to start looking up!**"

So I go pick up emily, and then we go to stephs and get a zena natalie and james.  We had great fun on the way to drop james off w/ the music screaming and the doors open as always.  Then we went to safeway...at first we just wanted hair bleach...then we went back and got a cake.  A chocolate cake.  HaHa then at natalies we ate cake and drank cream soda out of the mono leter and tried to bleach my hair. We watched animal alphabet and sang and it was fun.  Then we had to drop em off :( and we came back and watched part of chicago but I was falling asleep so I had to take zena home and go to bed.  Saturday: emly and I go on a hunt for pink tights.  Wow, we went everywhere.  If you're looking for pink tights...get them off line b/c portland doesn't have any.  Then she dyed my hair and it was fun.  We went to that pizza place across from QFC and it was pretty good except my mom and emily HAD to change tables and I felt so badly for our waiter guy.  AFter that we dropped emily off and my mom made me and sarah pretty! for bali since she loves to do make up.  Jason wanted us to call him when we were leaving for jaquies so we called him at like, 6:45...only we didn't leave until about 7:30...but luckily he forgot his hat that I was gonna wear so he had to go back home.  Then at jaquies we took a million pictures and sarah fell down the stairs.  Then alex and I went in jasons car w/ him and sarah and we got a little lost but it was funny.  We finally made it and then took our huge 17 people group picture.  The dance was pretty fun but the DJ sucked and the lights went on at the end.  We hung out at alex's after and Caton and I are both the foos ball AND pool p game champions! go us!! man, we rule.  Jason took me home and I got here at about 2ish and just crashed.  Then I slept through work again this morning.  Good thing laura's on vacation and I was only filling in for shelly...Alex lives right next to david...so I was gonna go visit him...but I ate a brownie instead.  Ha that remindes me of brooke and her arazona guys.  WoW is all I can say about that. Church tonight! YaY!

"event","Belief
 Makes things real
 Makes things feel
 Feel alright
 Belief
 Makes things true
 Things like you
 You and I
 Tonight, you arrested my mind
 When you came to my defense
 With a knife
 In the shape of your mouth
 In the form of your body
 With the wrath of a god
 Oh, you stood by me
 Belief
 Builds from scratch
 Doesn't need to relax
 It doesn't need space
 Long live the queen and I'll be the king
 In the collar of grace
 Tonight, you arrested my mind
 When you came to my defense
 With a knife
 In the shape of your mouth
 In the form of your body
 With the wrath of a god
 Oh, you stood by me
 Belief
 I'm going to yell it from the rooftops
 I'll wear a sign on my chest
 That's the least I can do
 Tonight, you arrested my mind
 When you came to my defense
 With a knife 
 In the shape of your mouth
 In the form of your body
 With the wrath of a god
 Oh, you stood by me"

"event","Man, it's so early to be home.  I'm used to getting here and then fighting for the TV to watch days and emily and tres telling me no...but no one else is here and it's only 1:45.  Today was alright.  I finished my health final by 8:30 and then just wrote cathy an amazing note and quasi watched philidelphia.  Then during lunch I talked to greg and brooke and lindsay for a while.  Alex and I skipped 5th and went to taco bell and hung out and then just wandered around.  He's one of the funniest people I konw.  Then on the bus I had to sit w/ danny...because we didn't see that it was there and molly almost left without us.  So greg and I were seperated.  Some random kid gave me a spiderman leg and arm.  It made me laugh.  I think emily and I Are gonna tie them to our nalgenes.  Now i'm talking to david.  He's my favorite, this is for you..:D!

"event","Today was alright.  It had it's ups and downs I suppose.  Before school emily's mom picked us up and we went to starbucks...only so did the rest of the school so it took about a million years.  We walked back to school in a hurry.  Then bio sucked.  The test was easy, but the situation with david just makes me depressed.  I hate that we aren't friends...but not enough to really do anything, b/c I know he doesn't care.  Alex stole my spinny ring... I WILL get it back...MY PRECIOUS!  There's a box bug crawling on my speaker...but I don't want to kill it.  Music Theory was wonderful b/c I just talked to sean all period.  Man, it opened my eyes to so much.  I love that kid.  I think he's pretty misunderstood.  Like, he just has all the answers I swear.  I hope we become better friends. I really like him.  Today reminded me why we were best friends in elementary school.  The bus ride home was funny.  Brain was trying to show minta card tricks...man...intellegence level, .000000001.  I fell asleep right after school and didn't wake up until about 5.  then Greg called and I felt badly b/c he wanted to go hang out..but I had to go to work.  I was hoping to get home early enough to still do something w/ him, b/c I REALLY want to, but I didn't.  I got to work and there were just about no kids there.  Laura was in a really good mood though which is unusual and good.  Her daughter was there too to help out and she's kinda a weird one.  I need to break her shell.  She's too quiet for my blood.  Nothing exciting happend at work.  I played gulf war with jerry and some legos and then one of the moms had on the same jeans as me and she thought it was so kewl and hip.  It  makes me mad though b/c I got them right before christmas from old navy for like $15 or something, and I thought it was amazing...and she got hers two days ago..for $2.75.  GR!  My mom picked me up and I went into the store for her and then we got home and talked in the driveway for a long time.  It was really good.  I liked it.  I called charley, but he's in an awful mood and something is really wrong.  I hate that after everything we've been through he still feels like he can't talk to me when something's wrong.  That's the worst.  I dont' get it at all.  So I stopped talking to him b/c he was just making me depressed.  I did some laundry and then talked online a bit.  I worked in my life journal too.  I didn't so much like the passages for today, but yesterdays were really good and I can't stop thinking about them.  Well, that's the extent of my day.  I think I'm gonna go shower and then to bed! I'm so glad I don't have any real finals tomorrow.  Health 2 doesn't count, and alex and I are going to taco bell during anthro b/c we had to turn our papers in tuesday and have nothign better to do...plus taco bell is just plain rockin."

"event","Seriously.  Somebody shoot me.  Winter camp better get here soon.  I'm gonna fail my bio final tomorrow and I just want to cry.  Nothing ever looks up.  Today was so bad.  I got to school and Alex and Aaron came to study w/ me in advisory and that was pretty fun I guess, those guys really make me laugh.  Then the math final was ok, but I'm not 100% on how I did.  I better pass that class or else I'll die.  Darwin and josh were supposed to show up for a meeting w/ mr bick but of course they didn't so alex and I just sat there forever.  It sucked big time.  They made us look so badly.  Then Charley had to come get me b/c we were stuck at school and I know he was pissed about it.  I felt awful.  I came home and just slept.  I couldn't do anything else.  I'm just completely and totally in every way emotionally exhausted.  I can't stand it.  I want to just explode.  I talked to greg today and I think that there are a lot of things that I need to think about that I'm avoiding.  I love how he knows me better then me sometimes.  I can't believe this all had to happen the same week as finals.  Sometimes I wonder what I did in a previous life to deserve the hell I've felt this year.  I think it's physically impossible for someone of the opposite sex to love me as something other then a wonderful selfless friend, sister, relative, mother figure.  I have the worst luck in town."

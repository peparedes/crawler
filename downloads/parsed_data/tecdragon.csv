To all my friends back in indiana, I'm sorry i've been such a hermit the past year or so, but you know how I am, I may not keep up to date with you guys, but you're still my friends, and I miss the lot of ya.
If you're curious, and i'd assume if you're still reading this, you are, I'll be back to Purdue for one more semester this fall, and hopefully by then I'll have some gainful employment in that scary place we all know as the real world.&nbsp; For anyone who hasn't been out west, and has the time, I say you should take a road trip, and we'll take a weekend to show you the sights.&nbsp; I'm well out here, and my dear Janice is out here with me, along with the marley dogg, so I've got no complaints.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe i'll start posting on this again...heh...yeah right."

    Like anyone confronted with the harshness of robbery on the high seas, you can be pessimistic at times. You can be a little bit unpredictable, but a pirate's life is far from full of certainties, so that fits in pretty well.    Arr!

This mountain is kinda in the middle of nowhere...driving here, you don't see it until you're right on it...and it's huge.  The biggest resort in the states in terms of skiiable acerage,  5,300 acres, 23 lifts, 220 runs, and 4,350 feet of vertical drop.

2 old hubs: no great loss, but it did leave us dead in the water
9 ports of a 1yr old 16port switch
a wireless router
one or two other small routers/switches
a laptop
a laptop harddrive
a video card
a couple computers
most of the personal ethernet ports that were connected to the network when it happened
a tv or two
a reciever or two 

That's all I can remember off the top of my head...all in all told, probably over $600 worth of damage.  Great."

"event","I found myself in the middle of a po-dunk town in a secluded part of what I am going to assume is America.  I'm stuck there with another person, vaugely female, but of a badass type. (Alice, Lara, you get the idea) And we seem to be recovering from injuries of a fashion, plane crash perhaps?  

As we recover our wits through the day, we start to notice that the townspeople all act a little odd, but we put that off to the hick factor.  They are a very religious crowd, so accordingly their parish leader has all the power in the town.  The whole time we're here, I have the vague feeling of deja vu, but I can't quite put my finger on it, being as out of sorts as I am.  Then, after the sacrament, I realize why...I know this feeling, and it's one that I'm not liable to forget.  It all becomes clear to me, as it all becomes unclear: The intense religiousness of these ceremonies, the frequency (it's not a sunday), the behaviour of the townspeople, the odd distinctess of the world.  

This is acid.  

What must be trace amounts in the normal drinking water, and deliberitly stonger dose in the sacramental wine...the look of psychosis in the parish leader's eyes when he thinks he's just gained two more faithful followers.  And faithful his followers are, for he has been here spinning his magic for years.   

Awake to the deception of this insane maniac, I and my unknown companion slowly try to make our way to the doorway.  But we're spotted and called out.  As the room full of townspeople turn to look at us, it is as if they all passed under a shadow.  And out from that shadow, I see a demon-faced horde.  Needless to say, we run.  There must have been a call to arms, because demons soon pour out of houses armed with rifles and shotguns.  But it seemed we had caught the favor of a god (or the townspeople were too out of their heads) for we suffered no fatal wounds.  Once or twice, we were grazed by a spray of buckshot.  Adrenaline and hallucinegen mixed in our blood as we fought our way back the parish leader's home.  Picking up weapons from villagers too weak, too mentally exauhsted to effectively resist, we start to cut a bloody swath from house to house, down the main dirt road.  

The psycopath is in a more sober state of mind, and has boarded up his home, and fires rounds from the second floor.  As many might guess though, hallucinegens tend to have an initial effect of added precision.  A basketball hoop may be as large as a trashcan; a billiards pocket might seem to just suck the balls in...and a man firing rifle rounds at you seems to have bright neon signs pointing straight at him.  

The effect a hunting rifle has on a human skull must have been something akin to swinging a baseball bat at a pumpkin, because that was what I saw...  A simple shotgun blast gained us access to his home, and subsequently, the barn.  Fortune shines upon us yet again when we find a servicable pick up and keys.  

From there, vague recollection of a get-away ensue.  We soon return with ofiicials to shed truth to this horrible story recounted in some policestation."

"event","A LETTER FROM A TICKED-OFF CALIFORNIAN:



          Dear Red States

         We're ticked off at the way you've treated
 California, and we've
 decided we're leaving.

         We intend to form our own country, and we're
 taking the other
 Blue States with us.

         In case you aren't aware, that includes
 Hawaii, Oregon,
 Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois
 and  all the
 Northeast. We believe this split will be beneficial
 to the nation, and
 especially to the people of the new country of New
 California.

         To sum up briefly: You get Texas, Oklahoma
 and all the slave
 states. We get stem cell research and the best
 beaches. We get Elliot
 Spitzer. You get Ken Lay! .

         We get the Statue of Liberty. You get
 OpryLand. We get Intel and
 Microsoft. You get WorldCom. We get Harvard. You get
 Ole' Miss.

         We get 85 percent of America's venture
 capital and
 entrepreneurs. You get Alabama. We get two-thirds of
 the tax revenue,
 you get to make the red states pay their fair share.

         Since our aggregate divorce rate is 22
 percent lower than the
 Christian Coalition's, we get a bunch of happy
 families. You get a bunch
 of single moms.

         Please be aware that Nuevo California will
 be pro-choice and
 anti-war, and we're going to want all our citizens
 back from Iraq at
 once. If you need people to fight, ask your
 evangelicals.

         They have kids they're apparently willing to
 send to their
 deaths for no purpose, and they don't care if you
 don't show pictures of
 their children's caskets coming home. We do wish you
 success in Iraq,
 and hope that the WMDs turn up, but we're not
 willing ! to spend our
 resources in Bush's Quagmire.

         With the Blue State s in hand, we will have
 firm control of 80
 percent of the country's fresh water, more than 90
 percent of the
 pineapple and lettuce, 92 percent of the nation's
 fresh fruit, 95
 percent of America's quality wines (you can serve
 French wines at state
 dinners) 90 percent of all cheese, 90 percent of the
 high tech industry,
 most of the U.S.
 low-sulfur coal, all living redwoods, sequoias and
 condors, all the Ivy
 and Seven Sister schools, plus Harvard, Yale,
 Stanford, Cal Tech and
 MIT.

         With the Red States, on the other hand, you
 will have to cope
 with 88 percent of all obese Americans (and their
 projected health care
 costs), 92 percent of all U.S. mosquitoes, nearly
 100 percent of the
 tornadoes, 90 percent of the hurricanes, 99 percent
 of all Southern
 Baptists, virtually 100 percent of all
 televangelists, Rush Limbaugh,
 Bob Jones University, Clemson and the University of
 Georgia.

         We get Hollywood and Yosemite, thank you!


         Additionally, 38 percent of those in the Red
 states believe
 Jonah was actually swallowed by a whale, 62 percent
 believe life is
 sacred unless we're discussing the death penalty or
 gun laws, 44 percent
 say that evolution is only a theory, 53 percent that
 Saddam was involved
 in 9/11 and 61 percent of you crazy people believe
 you are people with
 higher morals than we lefties.

         By the way, we're taking the good pot, too.
 You can have that
 dirt weed they grow in Mexico.

         Sincerely,
         Author Unknown in New California."

I think I'm going to  get reimbursed...and it looks like $.405/mile plus $91 a day for expenses like foor, lodging, etc.  But receipts are not required...even before this...I had planned to just sleep in my car, and drive.

But so, if anyone wants to hang out before I get the hell outta dodge, just drop me a line and let me know!

Being born on the 12th day of the month (3 energy) is likely to add a good bit of vitality to your life. 

The energy of 3 allows you bounce back rapidly from setbacks, physical or mental. 

There is a restlessness in your nature, but you seem to be able to portray an easygoing, sometimes ""couldn't care less"" attitude.



You have a natural ability to express yourself in public, and you always make a very good impression. 

Good with words, you excel in writing, speaking, and possibly singing. 

You are energetic and always a good conversationalist. 



You have a keen imagination, but you tend to scatter your energies and become involved with too may superficial matters. 

Your mind is practical and rational despite this tendency to jump about. 

You are affectionate and loving - but very sensitive. 

You are subject to rapid ups and downs.</td>

"event","So here's my contribution to our big Polynesian party up here.  It's called an Ice Luge, or Shot Luge, whatever.  It's a block of ice, with a channel carved out of the top surface for shots to be poured down.  Well, the 300 lb block of ice costs $100.  So, we decided, we'll make our own.  Well, I'll make our own....enter rubbermade tub...
28x37x61 cm are it's average dimensions (don't have anything perfectly rectangular).  This results in roughly 140 lbs of ice.  Not too shabby I think.  And I think it should be big enough.  if not....well, then i'll just need a bigger tub.  Anyhow.
So, instead of channels on top, I am going to run vinyl tubing down the inside, spiraled in a helix shape.  at this point, i'm thinking two side by side.  This is because I don't want it fucking up and have the two chutes melt and intersect each other.  Feasible arrangments will be tested later.  
So with the tubing inside, I will freeze it.  This I estimate will take several days to complete.  It will be formed a few inches at a time in an attempt to keep it nice and clear...as possible.  
When the time comes, i'll circulate hot water through the tubing until it is loose enough to pull right out.
Ohh, and i'm going to freeze [hopefully] many LEDs into it to light the shot chutes.  Fine details are accounted for, but go ahead and post any criticisms you might see incase i missed one."

"event","But damn.........My spring break week consisted of a trip out to Boulder, Co to visit my friend's bf's sister.  Let me just say, everyone there is fuckin' stoned stupid.  People can't drive, and cashiers don't understand the concept of speed and efficiency...damn hippies.  
So I booked it from Purdue to St. Louis (where they live) right after my exam.  We got on the road at 11:30 or so due to a minor snag.  The snag resulted in 1200mg of mescaline though.  So, as a precursor to my list of events...it was spring break...I was blazed the whole time to some degree or another.  And times are local.
We were somewhere around St. Louis on the edge of the plains when the drugs began to take hold...hee hee.
Friday:
Left at 11:30pm.
Saturday:
Arrived in Boulder at 12:30pm.  Temperature was 70, sunny.  We met with his sister, hung out all day, and crashed early due to car fatigue.
By nightfall, it was snowing.  4 inches or so in the morning.
Sunday:
At 5:00pm, I ate some mescaline and we headed up into the mountains and explored the Boulder Falls.
Came back to the hotel, hung out there and a little by the dorms...some fun fucked up people.
Monday:
Went to Rocky Mtn Ntnl Park.  Got to the aluvial flood plain, and ate some mushrooms.  We hiked around the area until we started to trip, and it started to snow.  We retreated to the safety of the car and stared at shit until we left and went back to the hotel.  A very entertaining adventure.
Tuesday:
Drove to Keystone mountain to get in some sweet skiing.  Went trailblazing a bit =]
Wednesday:
We got on road back to St. Louis at 3:00pm and by 4:30 I had eaten 2-CI to keep me entertained...or atleasted distraced from the ride.  It was interesting, but it was dark, leaving me with little visual information with which my mind could have had fun.  The eerie thing was seeing the sun go down through the rear windshield...and then seeing the moon go down through the rear windshield.  
Thursday:
We arrived at 6:00am and promptly went to sleep.  Woke up and ran some errands, took some bong rips, and finally got on the road.
Got to the CB (columbus bar) at around 11:45 for St. Patrick's day.  Went back to Z's house and hung out.
My mind is tired and my heart is dull...  
...but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can."

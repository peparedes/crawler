"event","Wow. I haven't posted in forever.
There's srsly something wrong. I even spend way less time on my compy. I go for daaays without even turning it on. lol crazy.
I must be getting a real life... or something like that.

So keeping this short; the basics:

I'm still living with my cousin Julia. 
Probably moving out in a week or two.
Might not be able to move into my own place til the beginning of December.
School's fine for now. I just take it one project at a time.
B/c I've been so bust lately I've made no progress at FF VII.
I'm totally enjoying my weekend off... but then I have to go work like Tuesday night. &gt;&lt;
I have to go buy groceries.
I bought dope as boots today from Abbey.
I hung out with Kaly today. That was awesome. I haven't seen her in like, forever!
I so voted on the 7th but I can not believe Brad Wall won. Double Gross. (Who invited Brad Wall? That guy's a cunt.)
I need to start buying christmas gifts but I have like zero point zero zero dollars for that.
I'm gonna go play some Phoenix Wright. &lt;3

P.S. Omg Cloud bought me the first season of X-Files!! &lt;3 I am so watching it tomorrow night. ^^"

"event","<p>So,<br />&nbsp;I don't really recall the last time I wrote a real LJ post... here goes.<br />Just got back from Emerald lake... really good times. I'm glad I went. I wasn't really sure how much fun I'd have without Sadie and Lindsay but it rocked. Becky has a cabin at the same lake so she, Chantal, Chantal's Boyfriend Dave, Shanda, Mitch, Shayla, Janelle Hollabitz ,Brianne George and Kelsi Allen were already up there. We spent the night before Canada day partying in Becky's&nbsp;cabin and it&nbsp;was super fun.<br />Anyways I only got a little bit of a burn, b/c I applied like way too much sunscreen (two coats) very often. Yay! The lake was really nice, we went kayaking and we played Super Mario Bros. 3 when it rained. ^^ I think we'll&nbsp;all have to go up&nbsp;sometime in August.<br />Moving on.<br />&nbsp;<br />OMG, I am so pumped to go see Tranformers tonight, Sorry Cloud we just have to go without you.&nbsp;<br />Maybe you can talk Alyssa into taking you.<br />Lindsay&nbsp;calls me up yesterday and was like ""umm, where is everyone?"" I explained that Brayden, Hunter and I just got back from the lake and that Sadie's in Calgary. Then she's like oh well ok ... we NEED to go see Trasformers! and I was like ho-m-g I completely forgot about it since I was in the bush for like 4 days.<br />We call Brayden and head over to the theatre (also with us was Lindsays friend Cory, a pretty cool guy) we get there at like 8 planning to go to the 10 o' clock show but... turns out ALL the shows that night are sold out. Ok, we buy tickets for tonight at 10! Awesome!<br /><br />We had a good time last night anyways. We were all feeling a little poor though. So we did a lot to keep it under budget.&nbsp;<br />Renting movies?<br />&nbsp;too much. So we stopped by my place considering we've got plenty.&nbsp;<br />Going to DQ?&nbsp;<br />no way, not unless we planned to dine and dash. Lindsay volunteers the half box of vanilla in her fridge and we go to super store for toppings and drinks.<br />We roll up at super store and all put 5 bux up on the table. We get an extra box of ice cream (super obscure brand) and scout out that sweet chocolate hard shell stuff, but it had to be twix brand since thats all they had. Drinks! We buy 3 bottles of PC fruit pop and a no name apple juice. Finally we dish out for a 5 dollar no name frozen pizza! yay we had 2 bux to spare for gas.<br />Oh and we couldn't be bothered with bags so we walked out of the store looking a lil weird. It was awesome.<br /><br /><br />I read all my transformers comics (aka 2) today, I so can't wait.<br />Brayden sucks at planning though. He's been out all day and finally I found out he's at cheerleading camp til 9. Shit. The lady at the theatre told us she'd been telling everyone to show up an hour early for seats. We were gonna go at 8. So yay, Cory can drive buuuuut he doesn't have a car. Lindsay does and her dad (who's out working) has the only key to it. She said he didn't know if he'd be home by 8... so I'm waitin around to see.<br />Tick Tock.<br />This entries a cliffhangar.<br />So hopefully Cory and Lindsay pull up to my door so we can have a sweet party tonight... and maybe I'll come home and write a 1 line review.<br /></p>"

"event","<p>B'Okay T'Shane.<br /><br />So I haven't updated in a while... but I've been busy.<br />Ok. Oh-so many days ago, like on the 6th Easter break was upon us.<br />Erica and I went to Edmonton the night of the 9th, arriving at like 5:30 in the morning&nbsp;and stayed at Michaels.<br />We slept most of that morning and then went downtown and to the Shaw Conference Centre!<br />We went to see the Silver Sun Pickups and OK Go! &lt;333<br />XD oh I guess they were both ""opening"" for Snow Patrol.... but I don't really care for them and neither does Erica.<br />We would have had to be at like the back of the line but we rock and randomly snuck in some back doors.&nbsp;<br />So we were at the very front!<br />The SSP were really awesome!<br />There was a screen set up behind the band and randomly during ""Little Lovers So Polite"" Tim Nordwind was backstage and they projected him onto the screen. He was wearing a jumpsuit and well Erica filmed it.<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp-jq072v2M"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp-jq072v2M</a>&nbsp;You can watch it here. I won't spoil it too much but lemme say it's amazing and it involves lettuce.<br />Me and Tim Nordwind made like SO much eye contact and OK Go did the Million Ways Dance!<br />We had brought some sweet Saskatchewan postcards and write really weird shit on the backs of them/<br />Afterwards we hung around outside for like 2 hours til finally we were like the only ones there and and Tim and Andy came out and signed some shit for us. &lt;333<br />Tim said Damian would probably be coming out soon but we waited around for another hour til like the crew left without sign&nbsp;<br />of Damian OR Dan...<br />sigh. We'll have to actually mail them their postcards. those lamers.<br />So anyways we had such a great time, even though everyone in Edmonton is like super rude.<br /><br />We came back on the 11th. I so have confidence in my ability to navigate big cities. This totally confirmed my skills. We took the buses and LRT everywhere and totally didn't get lost. <br />We rock.<br /><br />Oh then later that week on friday the 13th Michelle picked Lindsay and up and we met up with Annie, Sonya and Brittany at the foodcourt in Midtown. We ate, walked around and then went to go see The Hush Sound, Boys Like Girls and HelloGoodbye. The Hush Sound is an amazing band and their merch guy is too cool. His moustache was so sweet. We all bought Hush Sound t-shirts too even though they weren't the headliners. XD I guess their shirts were the coolest.<br />The Odeon was like teh packed. Erica was there and I saw Cordell too. I didn't like Boys Like Girls too much..they just seemed a bit bland but Lindsay insisted they were hot so ok. HelloGoodbye were really cool even though they didn't play ""I Saw It On Your Keyboard"". It was super fun.<br />Oh after that we all went to Mac's for frosters and then bowling with like 12 other kids at like 1 in the morning. Good Times.<br />I haven't really done a lot of schoolwork lately... but I did read a lot of FountainHead today.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh Sadie and I saw Meet the Robinsons on Monday I think.<br />It was way sweeter than I expected. The characters were so super cool! XD I even aspire to be likw Wilbur now.<br />Anyways yeah... I tried keeping this short. I'm pretty much done now.&nbsp;<br />We still have a lot of work to do on our OtaFest Cosplay... Maybe we'll do accessories tomorrow. Hopefully we'll get something done!&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>"

"event","B'Okay, T'Shane! 

This has been such a dope weekend. Busy and FUN! ^^ 
I guess it all started friday at lunch. I ate some food and then ditched school to go get my hair cut. It was fun, I always love getting my hair done. ^^ At first I was kinda worried b/c Johnny like made it all pouffy and curly and it kinda looked like I was from the 80's but I actually really like it now. I think it's cute as long as I style it properly. Friday night I showered and then fell asleep on it and it looked soooo dumb when I got up. XD 
Anyways I then went back to school to pick up my stuff. I spent some time lying on the floor with Brayden and Lindsay and then hooked up with my Cousin Julia and her Boyfriend Logan. Earlier she had told me she wanted to go shopping but then when she picked me up she was like oh...we already did that let's go out for supper! That was fine but then she wanted to go hang out at our Aunt Lorna's. We sat there for like ever! I was there so long that I didn't get to go see Blades of Glory with everyone. Oh well, so then Julia had to go, I asked her to drop me off at home but then I was like no the mall, I wanna shop...but then I was like no... I should go home and see mom. I got home,l and my mom wasn't there... she had gone to the mall. So was like eff this, I'm going shopping. So I put on some cute jewelery and packed up my pokemon backpack nice. Once I got there I just wandered around. I saw Dalena and talked to her for a bit. Then at like&nbsp;20 to 9 I saw Chelsie at A&amp;W and I talked to her for like 15 minutes til Shannon showed up. XD She told me about a pretty weird dream she had. Shannon told me about how&nbsp;she and Sarah were gonna try getting into the Juno show at The Odeon and hook up with the cool C.D. Plus kids inside. I really wanted to go but totally hadn't even thought about it b/c it was a 19+ show and security around the Odeon is tight. She was like come party with us it'll be fun. Then I was like ""why not? there's no harm in trying."" Then Cy showed up and said he'd meet us there later too. I hung out with Shannon til Sarah was done work and then we headed over. 
So exciting. We stood in the wrong line for awhile... smooth. Finally we got to the ticket lady and we didn't even get carded!! Eee. ^^&nbsp; 
That show was SO dope. Like amazing line up. First up, 'You Say Party! We say Die!', I'd never&nbsp;heard them before but they were really cool. Some experimental techno rock. Really fun. Then 'Shout Out Out Out Out'. OMG that was fun. I really love their music and the crowd was so into it. ^^ Everybody was jumping (including me). I think it was Connie who spilled beer all over Sarah and I. Then some guys were trying to crowd surf and one of them totally fell on my head. XD it was cool I didn't fall and I totally recovered with ease. Next up 'Malajube'. WOOT! I &lt;3 these guys so awesome. So we went up to the front of the stage to check em out. ^^ It was amazing watching them live. 
We wanted some merch after that so we went to the coat check to get our bags but Shannon had to leave. I think I got the last Malajube t-shirt. XD it's a medium and white but... it;s cool. I also got a c.d. and some buttons. &lt;333 
Sarah was all tired out from Malajube I guess, she kinda wanted to leave but&nbsp;Devon offered to drive us home after they went on. I was really impressed by D.J. Champion. There were 7 people on stage. The DJ and the band with him called the 'G-Strings' which consisted of a singer,&nbsp;a bassist and&nbsp;4 guitarists. Super awesome and their music was really varied. 
I was just so impressed that we got in. ^^ Then nobody even questioned us. The dude at the bar even tried to sell us some kokanees, but at 7 bux a drink? no thanks.&nbsp; 
I was like Fuck going to the Junos ceremony, I was just at THE best show of the weekend! &lt;3 
I still have a couple bruises from the pit but most of them are faded so I figure they'll basically be gone by tomorrow. 
I didn't get home til like quarter after 3.&nbsp;My feet were pretty sore, seeing as I was clever and decided walking everywhere that day was a good idea and had been jumping around for like 5 hours. I took a shower and went to bed at 4:30. 

DUN DUN ( The Law and Order version) 
9:34 AM. Saturday. 
My mom wakes me up.&nbsp; 
I was dazed for like a minute but then she asked me how the show was and I got all excited telling her about it til finally she was like, ""Enough!"". 
XD So it was fine getting up so early. We borrowed my Uncle John's macked out truck for the day so my mom and I went shopping. I bought some cool new jeans, a dress, a polo shirt, a striped t-shirt oh and white capris. XD maybe I was really tired but I was like ahahaha I should try on some white pants. Then I was like ooh these are cute and actually bought them. They won't stay clean for long... 
Oh I also bought a cute 40's style skirt and SUCH a cute polka dot tank top which fits me so awesomely. ^^ I don't really know where I'll wear them but they are really cute. 
We took Lachlan to some kids birthday party, went out for lunch, went grocery shopping, picked Lachlan up and then chilled at home for a bit. I was really tired so I went to sleep at like 1 in the morning and then slept for like 12 hours. yay. ^^ 
I woke up and watched House of Flying Daggers. &lt;3 Half martial arts, half make out session. 
Then I took like the longest bath, ever. 
I watched Juno coverage with my mom but they were really lame. too much Nelly Furtado. Her music actually sucks... not even trying to be mean, it's just... sucky.&nbsp; 
Also... how come the Hip didn't win some shit? wtf. I did enjoy Gordon Downies poem&nbsp;and DJ Champion rocked out too. 
Oh well. Now I'm eating scrumptious&nbsp;Chinese food that I got from some cutie delivery boy. ^^ 
Fried Rice rocks hardcore!

but I'm still bored and I haven't posted in like weeks so yeah. *LJ Update!*

SO ... I don't even know. Brayden drove Lindsay and I home today cuz he's so cool. That was nice.&nbsp;
Cloud and I went to Ruckers and played some DDR and a lot of drum mania a couple nights ago.&nbsp; We had to team up to play Drum Drum Mania ahaha so that we wouldn't lose but we both played so hard that we got blisters! T_T
That game rocks.
Oh and so I heard one of the songs on the machine and I TOTALLY recognised the vocals from ""I'M A LOSER"" by the Japanese band UNICORN.
I did some research... turns out there have been like 6 bands calling themselves Unicorn... but that is so not allowed by like teh universal laws of musical recording. oh well!
Man I think I was being a Spaz today but I was like SO restless. Maybe it's b/c I actually got EIGHT WHOLE hours of sleep last night. Plus ...gaaah my stomache was feeling ickay and I went the the washroom to pee and there was some chick crying in there and I was like AWKWARD!
I think maybe everyone was just acting a lil spazy, Brayden was telling me all about how uncool one of his teachers is and how angry he is with him and Molly's kinda freaked out about what to do with university and stuff...we had a whole conversation about that.

So ahahaha yeah. I'll think of something more interesting to write later.
Oh and I'm so super proud of myself for reading the title of ""Cinderella Academy"" in katakana... at least I'm pretty sure that what it says. ^^"

I think that's how I feel right now. I'm not really certain.&nbsp; I'm actually rather uncertain of most things right now.<br />I'm sitting here like SUCH a lamer. I'm sitting here...with really nothing to do, avoiding with all of my might the assigned reading of&nbsp;Fountainhead.&nbsp;<br />I'm listening to Conor Oberst sing glorious songs of heartbreak... I shouldn't even mention that it seems double lame b/c it's Valentine's day. I did. I'll leave it at that. Siiiiigh.<br />I have this icky feeling in my stomach. Maybe Conor is just making it worse.<br />Maybe I just ate too much supper. That may be it.<br />Right now... I'm listening to ""Happy Birthday to me"". Whoever put the info on this file felt the need to put in brackets next to the song title ""February 15th"". Just so I am soooo Aware that Conor, who was born Feb 15th, is sing happy birthday to himself.&nbsp; Handy.<br />Hmmm, coincidentally. That's in like an hour and a half. Cheers to Conor.<br />I think I may just be rather bored.<br /><br />Is the Socialist Review a real thing?<br />I'll check wikipedia.<br />Oh, it is. cool, it's a magazine. I wonder if I could get a subscription?&nbsp; but in 2002 it was renamed <strong><em>Radical Society: Review of Culture and Politics</em></strong>. A little long...and <em>Socialist</em> is no longer in the title. All in all... I say, less catchy.<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></em></strong><br />I think I may just be extremely bored.<br />When you start doing ANYTHING to avoid doing one specific thing, you either get a lot done or most everything seems boring.&nbsp;<br />Maybe that's not a rule ... that's just what it seems like at this time. I'm not really depressed, I don't think. It's not The Sunks. I'm just bored and things seem Bland.</p><p>Speaking of bland. I've been thinking about Canada and Saskatchewan and the identity of both relating to each other, the world and myself. Yeah thanks a lot school. It gets me thinking and then I just can't stop. Mrs. Grier said that one of Saskatchewan's strengths is it's comforting familiarity, but that is such an awful thing. The more I think about it the more depressing that one fact is. I don't want to stay here b/c of how familiar I am with it. I want to thrive! I want to go somewhere new where I can be out of my element and challenged! I want to have to adapt of grow maybe? I just don't want to stagnate!<br />That should be like my motto in life.&nbsp;<br />Sometime's I feel so lazy and unmotivated but...<strong><em>&nbsp; I JUST DON'T WANT TO STAGNATE!<br /></em></strong>Catchy hey?<br /><br />I guess that was a lil sad but I did promise Erica some sorrow.<br /><br />Oh! okay moving onto something... which I guess I am also whiny about...<br />I was gonna say I was all excited to watch Bleach on t.v. but gah in English I just can not stand &lt;3Gin's&lt;3 voice. So I've been watching a lot on youtube.<br />Siiiiigh.<br />I was thinking I want so much merch from SaddleCreek.com I should just have a saddle creek exclusive wardrobe. I was wondering how much of a faux pas owning multiple shirts from the same band would be. Too much? or enough to get away with?<br />Also I am SO excited Gruff Rhys is releasing an album right away. I just love his solo stuff. &lt;3 It's so awesome.<br /><br />okay. I'll just go read some web comics. Those'll make me happier and then I'll read about some revolutionary ideas involving social democracy and making the world a better place! ^^<br /></p>"

I guess it's been a while since I last posted but I've been busy and tired lately. Plus FInals.
I spent way to much time trying to figure out all the detials involved in applying to Mcgill last night. I really hope I get in. Everyone's like ""What about TEH costlyness?!?!"" It's true it might be really expensive to go there but it would be so worth it... right?
I'm pretty sure it would be.&nbsp;
I did pretty well on my finals. I got a 94 on that big crazy Eng./Hist. project we did. Although I haven't gotten&nbsp;my report card back yet I'm&nbsp;confident that it doesn't suck.
&nbsp;Siiiiiiigh.&nbsp;
I've done lots of stuff lately. I went ""grad dress shopping"" with Julia this weekend. Mostly she was shopping for a dress. I tried a few on but mostly for laughs, except I totally liked one b/c it was really cute but it fit awkwardly and cost a stupid ammount o cash. I don't really know what I want to wear to grad. XD I think I'll just let my grandma make me something.
I don't really remember all the junk I did. I guess none of it was really excited.
I think I'm gonna take driving lessons with Lori sometime next week so that'll be great. Hopefully I'll not such and be a little more confident so I can go get my liscense.
Awww.... Our open house it tomorrow night. I wanted to go see the prestige but noooow I guess I have to go perform with Jazz ... gah. I haven't practiced in like forever. crap.
Well there's nothing like last minute rehersals."

Good thing for BRIT. I've been getting updates from Will and Michelle. I think right now the Australians are taking a train fron Edmonton and will get here at like 3 in da morning. ouch.<br />Anyways I'm pretty sure I'll go to school tomorrow.<br />Michelle wants me to go to the social tomorrow night too. So I might stay and watch the games with Yvonne after school and then go. We'll see about it. She said it's really not formal though so, maybe.&nbsp;<br />I think she was trying to persuade me to go by telling me that&nbsp;cute asian boy was on the team she's hosting, she sent me a pic. He is cute even though she thought&nbsp;he was ""too smiley"".&nbsp;XD Then she was like, wait I know the perfect boy for you! She sent me a picture. He totally wishes he were Japanese. XD it's cute.<br />Wait... so I guess according to the news schools will be open tomorrow but ...I don't think city buses will be running. I won't really have a ride. We'll have to see about these things.<br /><br />Oh so I wanted to talk about how freaky this blizzarding shit was. I've NEVER in my entire life had a ""snow day"" this is the closest thing to it. I think it was at about 1:30 ish that they decided to send us home.&nbsp;<br />We all went out to da bus stop like usual, there are 2 different buses which stop there. So normally there's a bus like every 15 minutes.We waited and wait til eventually there were just 4 lonesome 12th graders. Molly, Brendan, Damon and I. Brendan&nbsp;left to call&nbsp;his Mom for a ride. Molly and I figured&nbsp;taking a bus going in anywhere would eventually get downtown and we wouldn't be out in the cold,&nbsp;and then a bus came so we flagged it down but the driver was like yeah it's gonna take at least 2 hours to go around and I had heard that the buses&nbsp;were taking hours to&nbsp;downtown so I wasn't sure about my connection. So Molly just went back to school... I figured the bus had to be coming sooooon so I went back to the stop and just stood there with Damon. It was really freakin cold and had been like an hour so I went inside b/c I was wearing chucks are omg I was cold.<br />So eventually one of my moms tech's picked me up and took me to her work place. He's a&nbsp;pretty good driver and we were in a big truck so it was fine but I was kind of freaked out.&nbsp;I couldn't see further than like a foot. Everyone had to have their hazard lights on. There were lots of accidents and&nbsp;vehicles which had been completely abandoned. It kind of reminded me of 28 Days Later, that British horror movie&nbsp;with the rage monkey's.&nbsp;I saw like a city bus just totally abandoned and a truck just sitting, empty in the middle of an intersection. It was EeEeEeEerie. haha yeah but I got home just fine... it just took a long time.<br />&nbsp;I think&nbsp;</font></p><div class=""ljuser""><br /></div><p><font size=""3""></font></p><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://yuu-trainwreck.livejournal.com/profile""><font size=""3""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></font></a><a href=""http://yuu-trainwreck.livejournal.com/""><b><font size=""3"">yuu_trainwreck</font></b></a></div><p><font size=""3"">&nbsp;took a pic.

Um, I was thinking of going out with Erica, but she has work at like 2.
I don't really wanna get up in the morning for like only 2 hours of shopping.&nbsp;
Maybe I'll call Nicole and see if she wants to hang out tomorrow afternoon.
I should go out and look for a new job. I heard EB Games is hiring.
I so want that job. &lt;3 It would be way better than my last place.
I think I'll drop off a resume at C.D. Plus sometime too.&nbsp;
That would be such a fun place to work. ^^

I kind of started on my english project. I was going to do the poems but that would prolly take too much work so I dug some paints out of the basement.
I'm not a good painter though.
Maybe I'll try to pass something off as ""abstract"".
I did do one sketch but it's stupid.&nbsp;
I'll have to write an accompanying poem.

We had some delicious Chinese tonight. I've already started picking at leftovers, seeing as it's like 2 in the morning.
I didn't get much sleep last night. I stayed up til like 4 reading old Penny Arcades. &lt;3
Maybe it was just b/c it was late and I was getting a lil tired but those guys are so funny.

oooo, and I read the Embalmer (the&nbsp;manga Chris gave me for x-mas), it was pretty good. ^^ I am definitely gonna get the 2nd one. I love the main dude. He's super laid back all the time and his hairs a mess but&nbsp;when he goes&nbsp;to a job and has to speak with a client he like slicks it down. It's super cute. Also he's a lil morbid but&nbsp;he always&nbsp;has floozie's on his arms. ^^&nbsp;It kind of reminds me of the old school style of Osamu Tezakuya, both in the way that it's drawn and the&nbsp; way the story progresses in chapters.&nbsp;

Oh yeah and FYI, I am so excited for the Transformer movie.It's gonna be&nbsp;good, right guys, right?&nbsp;I just, I have a FEELING! I call it, right now. It's gonna be a gooder. I mean Michael Bay's doing it. Thats a good sign. He's done cool stuff. He&nbsp;did The Island, and Pearl harbour (which is my favourite movie, IN AMERICA). I just, want so badly for this movie to just rock.
Transformers and SpiderMan 3. Those are the two&nbsp;movies I'm looking forward to this year. &lt;3
&nbsp;I'm gonna read more Penny Arcade and avoid my work."

T_T<br />I think I'll be back on the 6th so at that time you guys will all be able to fill me in on the fun that I missed... or maybe I'll hook up with a hot boy in Alberta and elope... never to see you again.<br /><br />whichever is most convenient.<br /><br /><div class=""ljuser""><br /></div></p>"

So today we hung out with my mom's side of the family. At my Uncle John and Aunt Grace's place. It was pretty fun. At first a little awkward b/c my closest cousins couldn't be there since the roads were so bad they didn't want to risk driving into town. It was fun. I'm really excited for my cousin Genny who is due on friday, ^^ I hope it's a boy. 
Oh and my cousin G.T. was there. I haven't seen him in years and I think he's doing pretty well.^^ 
XD Also I told Will I'd hook him up with Erica but Erica made...certain conditions on that event. 

I had a whole bunch of other junk to post about... but I'm kind of tired and don't recall most of it. 
I still have a LOT of christmas shopping to do. 
Tomorrow we have our curling wrap up. That'll be fun I guess. 
I've kind of progressed on Cloud's Fic. I've got like 2 pages. haha but the're kind of good...I think. 
I got an email from Takahiro, ^^ I'm so proud of him. He passed his entrance exam to university. 
I should write something for the Spark. I promised Michelle that I would. 

^^ Tomorrow is also our sleep in band spare. Woot. &lt;3 

Techno SO rocks. Last night I wanted so badly to live in a cool city with some sort of raveclub.&nbsp; 
This one is dedicated to all the ravers in the nation! 
To all the ravers in the nation!"

Sitting around playing video games, watching T.V., sleeeeeeping et c.
Good times, but now I like actually have to put effort into my school work and go to work.
I'm even busy with fics. I have sooooo little lounging time.
Haha, today I got ""written up"" for being late.&nbsp; I'm always late so apparently they installed&nbsp; a new three strikes and you're out policy pertaining to being late.
Basically I just have to make sure I find a new job before I'm late two more times.
Should'nt be too hard, right?
I'm kind of excited about Christmas this year, but I still have a lot of shopping to do. I think I'm&nbsp;supposed to go shopping with Julia (and possibly her friends? that could be awkward.) this saturday.

Bleh. I smell like french fries, and I left my breakfast juice at work ,again! T_T
Omg... I also like JUST remembered that I have tooooo much homework tonight. I have to do some questions on a short story like completely write an oral presentation for tomorrow.
Won't be so bad. As long as I do one tonight I can do the other tomorrow in 3rd.
I just feeeel so apathetic towards my schoolwork lately.
sigh....
XD Now I just want to write that fic for Cloud. I do that thing where you are willing to do anything which apears constructive to get out of any of my actual work. At first I so wasn't sure how to go about writing it (it's GinxRenji) but now that I've started&nbsp;I kind of know what I'm doing with it. Kind of...

Anyways I need to go bathe...( XD I do that sometimes) because I can smell the work lingering on me....whixh drives me crazy.
Bleh and then dig into some homework. Sigh.
Also I think Vincent and I are going ova to Cloud's to start sewing for otafest tomorrw night after work. That should be fun. &lt;3"

I just had the best sleep I've had in like months. 
a nice 13 hours in my own bed, it was rather sweet. I just like really needed it, so badly. I was falling asleep in english class yesterday and then after school I had to go to work. I came home afterwards instead of hanging with Sarah&nbsp;b/c I&nbsp;thought I'd be all responsible and get some homework done. That hardly happened but now I know that I have such a crazy ammount of work to do...tomorrow night. 
I watched Bleach last night&nbsp;and I totally laughed&nbsp;out loud the first time I heard Uryu's name. XD They were trying SO HARD to pronounce it as if they were Japanese. Cute li'l voice actors, but after a while Uryu's voice kinda got to me. It's just really agressive and manly... not how I imagined it. 
Hopefully Cloud and I will go shopping tomorrow ^^, get the hottest new manga from my true love Tite Kubo. &lt;333&nbsp; 

I have to go get ready for work now... 
at least it shouldn't be more than 8 hours. 
I was thinking of quiting and applying anywhere. XD Molly like really wants me to go work at Winners with her. Last night I asked Diane if I could be trained to work up front, and she said after Christmas. I think that'd be sweet compared to in the back...so I might stick around for that.&nbsp; 
We'll see."

I went over to Tyler's place with Cloud today to play his new Wii. ^^ It was pretty sweet. &lt;3 He has Twilight Princess, and using the sword with the remote is like SO fun. ^^&nbsp;
Then while I was letting Sadie play I was like falling asleep on the couch... I should go to bed right now but my stomache doesn't feel well. I'm so glad Tyler's mom gave me a ride to work or else I would have died it was really snowing out when we left. Closing went pretty well though since Kim was there.

oooookay, it's been a bit of a&nbsp;while since I last posted. I've been a lil busy lately. Work and whatnot, but I do so enjoy&nbsp;a good&nbsp;paycheque. So yeah. Uhhh... Chris' party was pretty sweet. XD Sadie and I had this sa-weet conversation with Wade about Yu-Gi-Oh, then Travis joined in, then Adam joined. XD It was just pretty sweet. I learned a lot. We played a little DDR. Also like way too much Halo 2. XD It was really fun though because some of the guys were like super intense but we were on balanced teams so it was good times. ^^ I hope we get together like that more often. I like hanging with my guy friends. All they ever want to do is talk about geeky things and do geeky things, not like girls and emooootiooons. 

Aaaaanyways, lots of good times lately. I bought Cloud FF XII, to repay her for everything. Aswell as Touch Detective for myself. It's kind of quirky. It hasn't been very challenging so far but it's quite quirky which I so appreciate. &lt;3 
XD I think I want to buy Cooking Mama. It looks cool... 

We won our curling game yesterday. I thought my shots kinda sucked...a few were ok, but Mrs.Sisson said they were awesome...so whatever. 
Oh I totally rocked my essay today. By that I mean, it was finished in time and I handed it in, stupid rough draft and all. 
I'm pretty sure I did a lot more stuff this week...but I can't really recall. 
I want to get a cell phone too. Maybe next cheque. I think it'll be the 24th. 
I'm not feeling very tired. Well I'm tired but not sleepy. That happens a lot after work. I work again tomorrow but got friday off because of that and I guess Sarah starts tomorrow. Also I'm happy Eric is transferring to Midtown, so I'll be able to switch shifts with another cool teen. 
Oh and apparently I am so a part of Abbey's sweet new Ska band. woot woot. 
Yeah.&nbsp; 
I think I'll go play a lil Trauma Centre. Then watch the Daily Show and Colbert Report at 1 o' clock. 
Daylights saving is lame. No one actually needs an extra hour of sunlight. Plus it's dark most of the time anyways.We don't need natural sunlight&nbsp;anymore. 
&nbsp;I don't see why the rest of North America doesn't just throw it out as the outdated tradition that it is."

I'm pretty sure there was a bunch of junk that happened this week that I was gonna write about but I don't really recall all of it. Actually I don't recall like any of it. Oh weeeeell. 

Salex got an offical invite from Brayden to sub in fo his mama and sister for team Obed. XD Turns out the game is the same saturday as Annie's party. Oh no! Her Halloween party starts at 8:30 and his game starts at like 6:15... so I'm doubting that'll happen. Unless we like do our hair, curl for like an hour and a half then get into costume at the rink...then go straight to the partay. XDXD I'm pretty sure that would just end up having really crazy sitcom style results. 

So yeah. 
As of late I've come to write weird crap, instead of my name, &nbsp;on my history assignments just so Mr. H will say them out. At first it wasn't even on purpose. During that Canadian map thing I wrote ""Wing-a-Ling Canada"" on it while joking with Cloud and then just forgot to put my name on it. Same thing happened with the shoe chart we made. I wrote ""Chuck Taylor"" on it, just because that was the kind of shoe I was working off of and forgot to put&nbsp; my name on it.&nbsp; So whiel he was handing them out I was working on something and SO not paying attention and he was like ""Chuck Taylor!"". I remember think ' wtf? there's no kid here named chuck' and Cloud was like ""Dude! that yours."" XD 
Yeah...so on that thing I handed in today I wrote ""Dr. Styl-z"". I know it's lame but for some reason I find it so funny. 


Cloud and I have drawn so many totally AWESOME incarnations of Domo-kun. We so need an online outline for out creativity. Some time sooooon but first we should get to halloween stuff.&nbsp; 
I have orientation thursday. Woot for a paying job.&nbsp; Then I think I work saturday, but I think Cloud wants to switch shifts with me to tag along to Japanese school with Yuu on Sunday.&nbsp; 
Oh aaaaand I want to have my party on friday. So I gots to make that happen! 
Also I've been like obssesing over ""Tear you Apart"" for like a week. &lt;3

I feel kind of lame.
 I should be happy; I was earlier. 
Curling was kind of fun today. I like that Yvonne's in the club. I don't seem to get to hang out with her enough but we can at least talk a little during practice.
My birthday's coming up. I should be excited but I'm pretty sure it'll turn out to be rather lame. I shouldn't get my hopes up.
At least I think I'll be able to get my contacts this month. Hopefully I'll get a job. Working at A&W sounds lame, especially in the kitchen but I'm basically ready for whatever because I just really want a job right now.

Living in my house just sucks so freaking hard. Seriously. I really hope I'll be able to move out next year when I go to university. 
I hope I can even afford to go to college but I don't even know what I should do with my life. 
I feel so lame."

"event","ok so woot, I fnally finished my english essay...""finally"", even though I basically only wrote it sunday night. I honestly tried to start wednesday and thursday but I was feeling way too icky and sick. Haha but I got 88% on my provinces thing for english, and I got some good marks on the history stuff we just got back so I should be doing ok so far, grades-wise.

I'm pretty excited about halloween. it's always such a fun holiday. ^^
Cloud and I need to start the sewing part of our costumes soon. Tomorrow I'll send her the progress pics we took the other night so she'll update with them. ^^
Our keyblades are starting to look pretty good. We'll have to go everywhere for like a week just to show  the stuff off. 

Curling practice was ok today... even though Yvonne didn't have her permission slips and Cloud copped out. XP
Also nobody saw but I TOTALLY actually threw a takeout! ^^ I was like eee.^^ I took the rock right out of the house and mine was in good position and stuff. I'll be so tired after we have practice tuesday and again wednesday...

Especially because I'm going to the Dropkick Murphy's/ Bad Religion show tomorrow. So we'll see.Oh Erica we gotta hang out at this show. ^^ It'll be fun.
Now I have to go find out what Canada is doing in Afghanistan so Mr.Hedlin doesn't eat my head tomorrow. ^^"

"event","Alrighty. I haven't posted in quite a few days. Heaven forbid!
It's because I've been so bust having ""a life"". 
Friday night Cloud and I went over to Abbey 'Rude' Fletchers place, watched Donnie Darko, played games and generally ate too much. It was such a sleepover that we even had pigtails and gossip. ^^ woot.
Then the next day Cloud and I went to her place and Brayden and Lindsay came over .Then we all watched too much Clone High and the times were good. We also did some work on our keyblades for halloween.

I have to start playing KH II tonight but I should start focusing on homework. I have to finish my analysis of provinces tonight and then start working on my identity essay. Also I should finish that resources map for history tomorrow.
Fun.
Band is starting to pick up and curling will start like next month so...yeah.
Today after school, Braden needed his chumpleader jacket, XD so he wouldn't like die from the coldness at the game. So I got a ride home with his friend (and she was a cheerleader surprisingly enough), Ashely. Turns out the cheerleaders weren't even officially all supposed to go to the game to cheer. I guess it's because everyone knows that we'll lose anyways. Some went though to support the guys and I guess cheer a little like ..""unofficially"" on the sidelines.

Also I might be playing D&D this friday, then go to Melanie's this saturday to watch like more clone high and Harvey Birdman with her, Cloud and Dorian.
Good Times."

been a few days since a real post.
I don't remember whats been happening lately. Except that I have to do some crazy practice before the next Jazz practice. Seriously, yeah. Intense.
Also I am SO gonna get Wakka's special item! I can practically taste it. I've gotten pretty good at Blitzball... soon it shall be mine.

I learned from art class that I'm really good at drawing lame stuff, like leaves. Woot.
^^ ooh but today when we went into class, Michael was there, talking to Mrs.Montgomery. <3 Then later Chau-sy came in! ^^

Ha ha...anyways. Cloud wants to go shopping for halloween cosplay supplies tomorrow but I'm low on funds, so I don't know if that'll happen... which sucks.
Also, I got myself into the spark. Not a good idea, but I promised Michelle I'd write something for her.
Enlgish class is so lame right now. Like let's try and pretend like Canada has ""an identity"", now we'll make these suckah kids try to define it. PSYCHE!

*sigh.*
I'm very cold, it's chilly in here.
ooh ^^ Abbey finally gave me that copy of the NJC c.d. so thats good.
Also I still need to write back to Ami. ^^She's so kawaii. I'll do that soon."

She's being a little indecisive this year.<br />We started on my mask and figured out what we're gonna need and what we'll make everything out of.<br /><br />Oh we're also going on the red mile tomorrow. ^^ I hope everyone else is...I'm looking at you Abbey and Erica!<br />ooh, maybe I can get Will to smuggle us some N00B-bands so we can get in fo free.<br />I love stuff that free.^^<br />Oh, maybe we can lynch art supplies to make signs for the game too. Perhaps ...number 7 signs. &lt;3<br /><br />Also Cloud just suggested we all get together and watch Clone High to celebrate my birthday next month. It sounds suspicously like her last party.<br />Well anyways, I'm excited about it. ^^<br /><br />I don't know what to say... except I've hardly had any homework yet. Not taking a math class is the BEST thing ever.<br />I even managed to do Mr.s Griers-deathly-one-day-lata-editorial-assignment but ad-libbing with a bunch of fluff. ^^I'm not friends with Cloud for nothing.<br />Haha anyways I love Bright Eyes.&nbsp;<br />Oh speaking of a band who is on the same label as Cursive!<br />Cursive is touring and they've gone to both Osaka and Tokyo &lt;3, but T_T the're not going to come to anywhere in Canada...<br />oh well.<br />Halloween and school spirit!<br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","<p>Man this long weekend has just been, oh so fun.&nbsp;<br />Yeah...<br />It's sunday, I think and all I've been doing is like reading manga and playing video games. I do that a lot normally but it's just that usually I alternate those things with pretending I have a life.<br />I guess I could have gone to the underground friday night but I totally didn't feel like going out. I wasn't tired or anything but I didn't feel like doing, anything, at all.<br />I wrapped kingdom hearts after deciding that I just didn't care to defeat Sephiroth. Also collecting a million things for synthesising sucks.<br />Also, I know Cloud is ""visiting"" her relatives for the weekend and won't read this til, like earliest monday night but...wtf?<br />I seriously beat Yunalesca with only one try. I was like oh snap it's Yunalesca and she's being a big skankface. I hate when enemies transform like 3 or 5 five times. I'm looking at you Yunalesca and Ansem!<br /><br />Lachlan was watching me play and he kept saying like the weirdest and funniest stuff like this,<br />""You know how Levi always tells me I'm adopted, well I think <em>he's</em> the adopted one! He doesn't like Kingdom Hearts <em>or</em> any Final Fantasy games. So you probably just forgot and I wasn't born yet when he was adopted!""<br />I was like...""yeah...totally.""<br /><br />Also I really want to rewatch Clone High. So we gots ta do that sometime you guys. Guys? Come on you guys! We should, guys....guys!<br />Yeah sorry, I'm that geeky.<br /><br />Also, I've never done that tagging thing but it would be interesting to go back through all of my posts and see how often I mention the same junk. So maybe (because I actually go through with all the junk I ever consider doing, cuz I'm not a huge slacker) I'll go through all of my posts and give them tags.<br /><br />I've been really into Miyavi this weekend too. I've always liked him but this weekend I downloaded like 30 of his songs. &lt;3<br />Yeah, good times.<br /><br /><br /></p>"

I so loves Amazing Stories. No doujin or yaoi, but best comic book store ever. ""How?"" you dare ask. Because my friend, They put Bleach 15 on the shelves an entire MONTH before it was supposed to be released. &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 
Therefor I purchased it even though it wasn't due til October. EEEEEE! 
GLEE^^ 

Also like a month ago I signed up for a penpal, online&nbsp;and I totally forgot. Today I gotl ike THEE cutest letter from this girl names Ami.^^ Maybe I'll scan it later if I'm not too lazy. 
I'm so happy.

"event","I can't recall what.<br /><br />Oh well. I'm bored.&nbsp;<br />Sooo bored...<br />I really like Cursive's new album. Happy Hollow. It's so awesome. ^^<br />Even if the're ""so 2002"" as ...<em>someone</em> says they are.<br />Anyways. I guess I 'll just go play FFX all night...or like reread all my Bleach^^. That would be fun.<br />I got my hair cut today. Nothing fancy, just like chin length. I decided not to get any bangs or whatnot.&nbsp;<br />Sigh. We were sooo close to 8th street and Amazing Stories but my mom wouldn't take me. She was like you can go tomorrow by bus to get Zombie Powder.&nbsp;<br />The bus sucks.<br />I feel really&nbsp;lame right now. I watched&nbsp;most of Spike Lee's ""When the Levee Breaks"". It's pretty good. Intense, but then I think about&nbsp;all the bull in the world and stuff. Gah. It's so depressing.&nbsp;<br />I can't wait til I can vote... but then I'll just get all cynical bout how other's suck...again.<br />My tummy hurts.&nbsp;<br />I want to eat something but I don't&nbsp;know what...<br />Maybe I'll go watch a movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Maybe Willard.<br />No, FFX and I'll listen to Cursive...maybe some Bright Eyes.<br />I think I want some poutine. I wish I had more money.<br />I wish I had a car, and somewhere to go.<br /><br />In some ways I kind of want school to start again...<br />bit it's probably just because I want a change of pace, and like to see everyone again.<br />Once school starts I never seem to have enough time to be bored or depressed, or to just laze about.<br />While in school I never seem to have enough time to do anything.<br /><br />This sucks... I want to do, something.<br />Anything really.<br />"

"event","I'm feeling so stupidly irrate.&nbsp; I just really hate my famliy and the stupid ass system it works by. I hate the asshole my mom married. I can't fucking believe she lets him say the shit that he does to me. It seems like all she cares about is keeping him satiated.&nbsp;
I hate it.
When he's not arround she's really cool and we have such a good time and stuff but that's hardly ever. He's like a fucking child. A controlling fucking prick.
I hate the bullshit that has to be tiptoed arround and the little shit we have to pretend is acceptable.
It's ridiculous.
He feels like he has to to prove how much fucking better than me he is ALL the damn time. He always has to show how wrong I am and how it's impossible for me to be able to correct him.&nbsp;
He's such a deluded wank.
Oh and I guess I should be hoping that he isn't being such a jerkfaced hobo to be reading this. I think he was reading my lj for a while... possibly became bored with it but I'm not sure. Wank.

I was really excited earlier about getting the pictures from the first half of my trip. I have some really great ones from Osaka, like from our hotel room and then at OsakaJo. &lt;3
Randomly a pic of Cloud on the plane with this apple juice which she freakin loved.
&nbsp;Also hot guys. They're fairly abundant but very difficult to catch in picture form. If only I had a keitai.&nbsp;
That one guy I could have picked up in the park, if Cloud and Seph had eaten that crepe just a little faster but n, then his gorlfriend had to show up.&nbsp;Oh and a chick with an eye patch, too cool. Maybe I'll post some later...
Japan makes me feel better but,

Gah. Just so many stupid little things. Sometimes I just really hate being here. It's so stupid and irritating. I fucking hate this bullshit."

"event","OMG, I'm tired of these MotherF#cking Snakes on this MotherF#cking plane!<br />That movie was too good. Seeing it with Cloud and Alyssa made it 10 times better. I need a movie poster!<br /><br />Also... WTF. I tried typing&nbsp; <a href=""mailto:MotherF@ckin"">MotherF@ckin</a> &nbsp;and...see it's underlined and highlighted for some reason...weird.<br /><br />Anyways. What have I been doing lately...<br />-reading too much bull shojo... thanks to Cloud.<br />-Babysitting some wanky kids. The boy is ok but the girl, talk about a whiner.<br />-Dreading the schoolyear starting.<br />-Watching these really hilarious Yu-Gi-Oh parody videos. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=LittleKuriboh"">http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=LittleKuriboh</a>&nbsp;recommended by one Gordon, I am so thankful to him.<br /><br />Ok we went out shopping for school supplies like last week. So bizarre. Like two weeks early. Usually we wait til like the night before school begins to do that.<br />I think my reality is really skewed right now care of Japan...<br />I don't really remember what has happened this last week or so. I've been reading too much manga... like everything Cloud lent me and my Yu-Gi-Oh and my Hikaru No Go. Oh and all the hot stuff I bought in Japan. I'm looking at you Celeb-Rabu. &lt;3<br />Oh and I've been listening to The Libertines like crazy lately. They are too good.^^"

"event","Ok, so I've been lamely busy lately.&nbsp;<br />Yesterday I went manga shopping with Tifa and Cloud. Wheee. Bought some Hikaru No Go. Also I MUST save the money I make this week for a Play Arts Squall and an Axel. &lt;3<br />Only a couple weeks til Zombie Powder! ^^<br />Oh...XD Then Cloud and I went to the rainbow to see Tokyo Drift. I know. Terrible concept, stupid movie et c.<br />I thought we'd be the only one's there. Not only was it stupid but it's been in theatres for like weeks. XD Turns out that there were quite a few other teens who wanted to see it. There were some PRETTY HOT kids in that flick and one guy kinda looked like Miyamoto Shigeru, so that was his name.&nbsp;<br />We made it good times with quotes like this one,&nbsp;<br /><em><font size=""4"">""Woah! He got up and into a car already?!&nbsp; Thats Asian!""</font></em><br />I guess she had to pick up Alyssa today at like 5 in the morning.<br />haha fun. I'm babysitting this week, til thursday and again next monday.<br />We totally have to go see&nbsp; <strong><em><font size=""4"">Snakes On A Plane</font>&nbsp; </em></strong>this friday.<br />I am so excited. XD<br />I also hung out with my cousins, went shopping, went to the ex a couple times (my glasses fell off while I was on the orbiter and we couldn't find them, I was like freaking out but then this cool carnie found em. I was so relieved.) , I also had a pretty good time at Matt's wedding.<br /><br />I decided to ask my grandma for a Nintendo DS for my birthday in a couple of months. ^^ I really want one. I especially want to play Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney and Trauma Centre.<br />I probably won't have time to get my&nbsp;haircut until&nbsp;Friday... and I'll put off finding a job, some more.<br />I should stop slacking off, School starts again in almost two weeks.<br />oooh, but I got this sweet&nbsp;Pokemon Backpack, Marvel calendar and Dragonball napkins (&lt;3 Goku) at the&nbsp;Zellers&nbsp;super crazy moving sale.&nbsp;<br />I'm prepared.<br /><br />"

"event","Sigh... 

Sometimes things seem so foolish. Foolish, unnecessary, redundant and all together avoidable. 
this is stupid. 
All of a sudden I feel so lamely depressed. 
Most of the plans we make are spontaneous and things change all of the time.&nbsp; 
T'Seng seems to always fret about junk. Too stressed out I guess... 
My friends tend to be too stressed... about random junk too sometimes. 
It's kind of lame how no one seems to have enough patience for Cloud. 
I know she and I both are pretty inconsiderate at times but seriously... 
is it so far to the extreme as to cause such a fuss? 
I guess I'm just bad with people... but I thought with friends everyone tried to give a little. 
Sometimes not everyone is up for giving but&nbsp;it was ok... 
Maybe I just totally don't understand the was relationships are supposed to work. 
I'm just thinking in circles... 
Sigh... 


Well, Jeff kind of just cheered me up. Talking about Tammy, egg tarts and microwaves. 
I wish I had a cyclone. Those things rock... 
anyways... 
I went to the fringe last night with my cousins and I bought some cool pins. ^^ One with Karl Marx on it. &lt;3 
I also bought this SWEET t-shirt from star 80 thats says ""I &lt;3 Zombies"". ^^ I really do love them. 
The heart on the shirt is like a real heart too, so it's awesome. I think there's a play going on at the fringe called Zombies: A&nbsp; Love Story. I kinda wanna see it. So if I'm ever free and someone wants to catch it with me... 
How ling is the fringe going on til? I fairly busy intill sunday so, hopefully longer. 
I saw Yuffie there.She makes me feel better. 
We ate like a bunch of crab there. Oh and there's this really cool new store of broadway that made me think of Yuffie. It imports a bunch of sweet asian styles, from like Hong Kong. I tried a few things on, just because everything there is like uber cute, but nothing fit around my stupid bust. &gt;&lt; I bet she could wear stuff from there. It's funny too because a lot has like a 1980's throwback feel. 

Anyways...HOPEFULLY, T'Seng, Cloud, Tifa and I will all go to the ex on friday... 

I think I'll retire to the den with some appropriately awesome manga. That'll make me feel better."

"event","I watched Donnie Darko last night. &lt;3 
Apparently everyone just loves Jake, even my cousin Holly, who's staying at my aunt Lorna's place for the summer. 
Yesterday I went over there because my cousins, Julia and Corrine are staying there for the week.&nbsp; 
We went and hung out on Broadway and then I stayed the night. 
Everyone's in town since the ""reunion"" is this weekend. 
Reunion. 
As well as my cousin Mathew's wedding being the Saturday after... 
We went shopping with my mom today, since we all wanted new shoes and dresses and whatnot. 
It was pretty good times. 

I think it was Tuesday, I went and hung out with Tammy. I was at her place for almost two hours and we just chatted and stuff. I missed hanging out with her. I hardly spent time with her at all this last year. We didn't have any classes together.boo. 
Hopefully it'll be different this year. Then we went to Chung Wah's and to the Eastern Market which is like wan fau...or something in Chinese...I'm not sure. I sounded stupid trying to pronounce it so I just stopped. 
I spent like almost 20 bucks but I got some Gokuri Squeeze&lt;3, which I had on ma trip and like ooh Hamtaro chocolate balls which I got a stamp with. 
Then we went to like the mall... but it was fun cause we were laughing at things. Oh then we saw her brother there and he was getting his girlfriend a watch. It was kind of funny. He wanted to make sure it was perfect. 
^^ How nice. 
I also got some new StarWars Pez dispensers.&lt;3 I recently obtained a Yoda, a Stormtrooper and a C3-PO. 
Anyways then we kept walking around and he came back apparently he was weirded out b/c the watch didn't have a second hand... so he wanted to look around for a better one. Anyways we walked back to her place and I started walking home but apparently he wasn't doing anything and wanted to drive me home but then because we basically bought a bunch of candy at the chinese stores he wanted some candy so he drove us over to that swanky candy shop in the centre mall. 
^^He's like such a nice guy.He was like making sure we had junk to talk about and whatnot and even though he's all into R anf B...( I think he's the first person I've ever said, ""That stuff's not bad"" to)... he was talking about Crowned King with me because I was wearing my Crowned King t-shirt. 
No wonder everyone likes him so much. Tammy always complains about how girls always like her brother. 
He's just really cool and whatnot. 

Anyways Cloud is back home and I'm pretty excited to hang with her. Even though I'm gonna be lamely busy this week. We'll hafta go manga shopping and out with Erica and Abbey. ^^ It'll be such good times."

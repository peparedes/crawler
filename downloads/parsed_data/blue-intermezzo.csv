"event","Today AND tommorow are/were snow days. Ick. I'm so tired of snow. But, more wintertime, MORE TAIYAKI =) I think all I did today was walk over to Korori's and had a snowball fight. There's nothing to do. Soon, American Idol will come on. I'll obviously watch that. X3;

I watched Heroes last night. I'm going to put my thoughts under an El Jay cut, because it contains spoliers =O

<lj-cut text=""Mmm...taiyaki is sooo good..."">
Well, TV Guide said this month, a hero will die. I wonder who it is...At first, I thought it was going to be Matt, whenever he was lying on top of that building. But, he was alive. It could be Mohinder, or Jessica, or...anybody. XP I REALLY do not want it to be Ando, nor Hiro. But, I bet Niki will learn how to control Jessica. I'll be happy when that happens. Jessica drives me wild. D|;; So, those are my thoughts. And, at this point, it seems no hero can trust anybody except themselves. Yup.</lj-cut>

And, the friends only banner...

Okay, I would like to use <a href=""http://www.animepaper.net/gallery/scans/AIR/item107572/"">this image</a>, please. The colour sceme would be...maybe a light lavendar. Text: ""I'm Sorry, But This Journal is Friends Only. Fly Away to Be Added."" If there's anything I'm missing, do tell. =)</lj-cut>"

"event","I've got to find a ""Friends Only"" banner somewhere. Most likely a Naruto, Bleach, or Kanon one. -shot- I may be a guy, but kanon is one of my favorite games/animes. =XX

LITTLE SISTER, IM FRIEND YOU, M'KAY? <s>Now we can have comment wars.</s>

Well, today was quite boring. I woke up to my sister Haley, who was trying to sing. X.x Jeez. It was a sad attempt. I hate being the middle child. I have a 12 year old sister, Haley, she's in 7th Grade. Then me, then my 22-year-old sister, Akane. She's mean to me. Boo Hoo. 

Well, I'm off. Good bye, children. Lol."

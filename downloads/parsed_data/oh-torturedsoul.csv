It was interesting to read my own words that I didn't remember, and to be reminded of things that happened to me that I've long since forgotten. There are entries where I mentioned things that were trivial at the time, but have become so important to me now...and vice versa: I stressed over things that were significant to me then, but are now distant memories. Also, there are entries in which I anticipated events that are now fond memories. I'm an eloquent writer...or, I was back on '06. Maybe I'll use this for poetry now. Maybe not, I'm not sure."

"event","Sometimes I really detest caring for other people. I don't mean this in an emo, hinting at ""oh i am bitter and upset about something"" sort of way. I just think that I would be a much freer spirit if I could be completely sociopathic and not care for others at all. I'm halfway there. It's weird because the more I want to be shallow, the easier it is to be increasingly shallow. You'd think that's impossible, but it isn't. To just become more self-centered and less affected by others, and by what goes on around you. I'm living it! I've even started to strongly dislike animals and children. And anyone or anything else that isn't of use or beneficial to me. Sound shallow to you?

The fact is, obviously, I DO truly care about a choice few. Of course I do. But it just makes me so worried that I'll be disappointed or hurt or let down or betrayed or something, anything at all. So I usually distance myself from those people as much as I can. Honestly. 
I do like to have fun with people for short periods of time, if I'm in the right mood. I'll be the most social little lady you ever did see--as long as I don't actually have to form and maintain a bond of any sort with anyone. Too much work to maintain the few I already have. I don't like trying to meet people's expectations, so I try to be nearly a stranger to everyone, so that they don't really have any solid expectations of me at all. Then I'm homefree. 
I like for people to think that they know me really well and to believe that we're close, and know deep down that they don't actually know a goddamn thing about me. I feel really safe and preserved that way. And I am temporarily entertained at the same time.

So anyway....let's be best friends.

Team ""Generation Gap"" received $880 in funding from the NH Vouth Venture! Our presentation yesterday impressed them. (: That means an A+ for us, the team members! Woohoo! Except, now we have a lot more responsibility...

I'm psyched for summer this year. No huge reason...just because. Summer vacation will mean that Junior year is over, haha. And I'm gonna work a lot and save my pennies and hopefully tutor a kid in Spanish, which I'm really excited for. I also would like to go to the beach several times this year. Anybody up for a fun and silly beach trip or two with me? Just because!

Sooo, one week from the day after tomorrow, our final exams start, and then it's less than a week until THE END!! (And I don't mean the 6-6-6 sort of ending.)

"event","So, since Sunday night, I've consumed 2 entire Ben & Jerry's ice cream pints. I think they're pints, anyway. My only complaint about that is my fingers getting gooey where I grip the spoon because on the rare occasion when I let go of the spoon, it rests against the side of the carton and gets all ice-creamy, and then when I pick it back up, we have a mess.

Our presentation kicked major ass today...I hope! haha. We got insanely lost but made it just in time and did really well. Leave it to ""team G-spot!"" We always save the day! Haha. (:

You piss me off or hurt my feelings --> You find yourself eating my dust soon thereafter. Actually, I don't even intend upon leaving any dust behind. So you can eat memories. I don't feel sorry and I don't look back. At 15, I disowned an entire side of my family.
Someday those tendencies of mine will catch up to me, but for now, when I'm still a vulnerable, young soul, it works for me. I don't need anybody's shit! Haha. Random tangent, there."

"event","I am sick with a nasty, killer cold. Sore throat, coughing--voice all messed up, yucky nose, body aches, fatigue, etc. It's sort of sucky. I left school after 2nd period today. and slept deeply and solidly from 10am to 2:30pm, haha. I worked a TON this weekend, and barely slept or ate, like the idiot I am. Which is why I am so easily infected with disease, haha.
I've got 10 absences in U.S. History and 9 in most of my other classes. For some reason, French got lucky and I've only missed 7 classes in there, lol. I'm ridiculous, I know. I just want Junior year to BE OVER AND DONE WITH! SO badly. 
Finals are gonna be pretty damn challenging but I'm still psyched because finals week rocks. 
My computer is being overtaken by a virus, sent to me via IM when I had let my guard down, lol. I was so innocent! 
I don't mean to sound whiney in this entry. I'm in good spirits.

For anyone wondering, the rumors are true. I am indeed dating a 23 year old. It sounds bad and I am aware of that, which is why I don't go around telling folks left and right because they may just assume the worst. But he's great, and I've decided that I just don't care much about what people might think. Anyone who knows me knows that it's alright. We get along well and have fun. We care about each other a lot. He makes me happy. (: I'm not a dirty fool, so nobody needs to worry for me! But I understand a person's concern. Yes, my parents know, and they are cool with it. Like I said, I'm not a fool, and I wouldn't date a guy behind my parents' backs because that's just lame and shitty.

So tomorrow will pretty much determine my US History semester grade. My group has to go present a shitload of stuff way out in Milton, NH. Wish us luck! ::bites nails:: We have to do a ton of work tonight in preparation. It should be interesting, haha. Speaking of which, I've gotta go take some cold medicine and head on over to Dan's house for our project stuff. 

Have a great week, everyone. Just a handful of days left to go before Summertime hits!!

"event","this is rare: i sort of opened up, here. but i suppose it's halfway secret. muahaha. 

1. i will always love you. i will always love you. our hearts are very close, though i hate you sometimes for doing the things you did to sabotage what we had.
2. you make me feel so many different things. i think that you and i fuel one another's fires, truly. you're addictive and sometimes i can't express myself to you as well as i'd like to, but i hope that with time we can be closer and more comfortable and even more deeply understanding with one another. i don't know how it happened, but i love my connection with you, as scandelous as it may seem. there is love present.
3. i like you and i hope you didn't mind my spontaneity on that certain occasion. (i like to think that you enjoyed it, and i often wish it hadn't been cut so short.) we have a lot of fun together and i wonder if you secretly think of me in the way i think of you. i daydream sometimes about how maybe, many years from now, you and i will have a spilling of emotions and it could be grand...
4. your mistake continues to have lasting effects on the person i am and i hate that i can't escape what happened. it's so confusing and apparently, scarring. you're a piece of shit, to put it frankly, but somehow i feel more pity than anything else toward you. more than anger. 
5. i really miss being closer to you and i hope you believe me when i say i want to make plans. we have so much fun together! and i know we've got great tales to spin. you're the only person i can sing in front of comfortably. beware of humans!
6. to put it into perspective: there is nobody on earth who i would not kill for you. you're a miracle and i'll do everything i can to make your life as near to perfect as possible. i love you!
7. you have always annoyed the living shit out of me, in any given situation.
8. I'm so glad we were able to bond a little bit...sort of. sometimes i feel like you don't care for me as much as i do for you, and it's alarming how much that hurts, even if just for a fleeting moment. i still have nightmares about losing you in places. i hope you know i'm here for you. sometimes i worry for your future and the choices you may make. i think it's possible that you're in love with me, and i with you. i wonder if you've considered that. it would not be something to pursue.
9. i have a lot to thank you for, really, but i hate what a tool you are. i feel so torn sometimes because i wonder if i'm supposed to defend you anyway when i'm on the other side. it'd be nice if you could be yourself because i like you a lot more when you're not being so insanely fake. i like it when we have fun together, or geniunely agree about something. oftentimes i just nod and smile to please you. 
10. i really look up to you and i hope i can prove myself a worthy being. you're a perfect balance of fun and professionalism, which i'd like also to achieve.
11. we've been so close for so long and i've always enjoyed you. i'm afraid to lose touch with you after high school.
12. i'm glad i met you this year because you're intensely fun to be around. i know that we both feel as though he will always sort of be between us, and that hinders things. but lately i feel less of a barrier and that's great because you're so fucking awesome. i would really like to be your close friend and hang out with you on weekends, haha. that's weird for me. JLL.
13. i think you're sick and it's really depressing to watch. you would never accept help. it's a downer, for sure.
14. who knows where we'd be without you? thank you so much, and i love you. you've given me some of the best, most simple, applicable, and timeless advice of my life. i worry sometimes that i don't impress you. i would never want to waste your efforts to give me opportunities in life, so i'll try to always take advantage of all the oportunities i can. expanding horizons!"

Italy was AMAZING, I miss it a lot. I had so much fun seeing great things and chillaxin with Ryan, Jenni, Emily, and Nicole, as well as other cool folks. I peed my pants about seeing thei Eiffel Tower during our layover tour in Paris!

Festival was really great to come home to, I had so much fun! The food was excellent and our performance was kick-ass! I felt tired on Friday night, but fine for most of yesterday, after a nice rest. I went to work right after we got home, and decided to take the closing shift. So I worked until 2am-ish.

So, craziest thing ever: I slept until 4:33pm today! Holy CWAP. I woke up briefly at 5:36am to the mysterious with-held number calling my cell phone and I set it to silent. Then, I woke up at 9:46am, but fell back to sleep forever, haha. I think I might be sick or dying, or just jet-lagged like wo. I had a cool life-or-death dream that involved a baby and me taking a trip to the Salvation Army to buy a dress, just for kicks. Sleeping that late made me feel so lazy, and not to mention the fact that my shift at work had started at 4pm...haha, ooooh. And somehow I still feel tired! Slept too much for my own good, I suppose.

School tomorrow----ughhh. I have a ton of work to do and make up and start and finish and tests and quizzes and meetings agh! I have NO idea if or how I will manage pull off the English project by Tuesday, either, and I hate to ask for an extention but I think I'll have to.

I was a little bit surprised to not have been cast as even a small part, but I'm not wicked upset about it or anything near that. No, I'm actually pretty cool with it. I'll have some free time now, which has been really strange so far this week! I've still got a bit of ""Helpless Doorknobs"" and Festival to participate in, so that'll be fun. Till it's over. I'm not gonna lie: I'll likely get bored in a month or so, and miss theatre and Mr. L and my theatre posse and all, and when I see the performance of ""The Crucible,"" though thrilled for the kids in it, I'll feel some disappointment that I couldn't partake in the fun.

I discovered that a cute old man who works with me at Domino's shares my birthday, and that was neat, because he's this funny little old man who has a sewing and embroidery company, and brings in pictures of sewing machines to show to everyone, and he only works at Domino's one or two days every week just because he gets bored. His name is Dave.
I had a fun birthday, I got a digital camara! It was all I wanted but I was still surprised to receive one. It's PERFECT, and lightweight for travel and it's userfriendly and great quality...I'm so, so excited to capture each and every Italian moment on film, teehee. I worked on my birthday but honestly I enjoyed it. I have not been working much lately, as I mentioned before, and it's weird but I sort of miss the place, haha. So I worked a lot this weekend. I closed on Saturday night, and at 1am I went out with a few people from work for my ""birthday dinner."" (: We went to Bickfords, haha. I love french toast. 
So I went to sleep at like 4:40am and got up at 9:05 for a birthday dinner, which was really just what my mother wanted, but whatever. She got me the camara so I have no complaints about her today. Another cool thing I discovered is that, while I thought I had $400 to my name, I actually have a little over $600. This is AWESOME, because I only want to bring $600 to Italy, and this means I already have some funds for prom that I can toss around... (:
Lots of homework tonight. Well, just sorta tedious stuff, and one big English thing worth a test grade. This week is going to be sort of a burden. I have to juggle Peer Mediation stuff each day as we frantically plan our Youth Violence Prevention Week next week, and rehearsals Monday and Tuesday and hopefully NOT Thursday...haha. We'll see.
I'm excited for Festival Numero Dos this weekend! It's at Manchester West, for anyone interested, and in a weird way I hope we DON'T move on to New England's, because Ryan and I will not be in the country for that fiesta, and even though I could be replaced in the play without too much trouble, Ryan is pretty essential to the entire performance! teehee

Tonight we put on a show for Empty Bowls. I meant to contribute my $12 and eat free soup, but I sort of forgot, and just showed up in time to get ready and perform the play, haha. There's always next year, I suppose. Thanks to anyone who came to see us tonight!! It's a blast. (:
I sort of just had an hour-long ""sex talk"" with both of my parents. My mother can be a huge tool sometimes. During the aforementioned conversation, she drifted in and out of tooly-ness. 
Back to work this week, I hope. I'm losing a lot of money by taking so much time off! I am missing 13 shifts in the month of April, and I already know of 3 shifts I need to take off in May. Yikes. Italy, Italy, Italy! I want to bring lots of spending money so that I can find schweet Italian gifts for my lovers! ::wink::
I love chocolate. Especially chocolate ice cream with chocolate cookies in it, followed by chocolate Lindor truffles. (:
School is totally not a top priority right now, even though I'm trying so hard to adopt my former mentality...my absences are racking up. Yet I feel as though I;m not missing much when I don't go to school...
Not sure if I'll audition for the Crucible yet. It really deoends upon the schedule and performance dates and stuff, I suppose. I don't enjoy being overscheduled, like when I'm expected to be in 3+ places at once, I get a bit overwhelmed, haha.
Homework to do.
I forget to eat a lot lately, I just have other things to tend to!
Social life is such a burden...
Prom----aghhh. I need a dress, still. Not sure when I'll ever have the time AND the money at the same time to do that whole shopping part...
Good night!

"event","So things are very strange lately. I'm so mixed up about people and my relationships with them and stuff, I really would prefer not to know anyone at all. But it's too damn late. My parents are considering moving the family to New Orleans. Wicked cool. It's still very iffy and i'm not sure yet of whether I'd go or not; but if I stayed here, I don't know exactly where I'd be welcomed (and I don't mean that in a self-pitying sort of way!)
Festival this weekend is going to be insane. Our play is turning out well, but we all have important tasks to tend to also, since MHS is hosting the whole thing and all. I have to be at the school at 6am on Saturday! Rehearsals are really fun though, and it's been great. (:
I've got a ton of homework tonight...my grades have been pretty nice lately. ::smile::
I wish this cold would go away for real and for good.
I downloaded some new-old Jimmy Eat World last week and it's really great. Some EPs and things of that nature.
I feel so busy always, like I've never got enough time for anything.
My last paycheck was huge--but I had to take this entire week off, so that'll hurt the old wallet in terms of Italy funds, haha. I'm psyched for Italy.
People seem to think so very highly of me lately, and for some reason it makes me sort of nervous, like I'm not as great as everyone might believe. I've got a dark side just like everybody else, you know.
Good night to all!"

Intelligence is important to you. You always like to be around smart people.
In fact, you're often a little short with people who don't impress you mentally.

You seem distant to some - but it's usually because you're deep in thought.
Those who understand you best are fellow Rationals.

In love, you tend to approach things with logic. You seek a compatible mate - who is also very intelligent.

At work, you tend to gravitate toward idea building careers - like programming, medicine, or academia.

With others, you are very honest and direct. People often can't take your criticism well.

As far as your looks go, you're coasting on what you were born with. You think fashion is silly.

Little do you know that your personal paradise is so appealing that it sucks people in.

Propensity for Monogamy:

Your propensity for monogamy is high.
You find it easy to be devoted and loyal to one person.
And in return, you expect the same from who you love.
Any sign of straying, and you'll end things.

Experience Level:

Your experience level is high.
You've loved, lost, and loved again.
You have had a wide range of love experiences.
And when the real thing comes along, you know it!

Dominance:

Your dominance is low.
This doesn't mean you're a doormat, just balanced.
You know a relationship is not about getting your way.
And you love to give your sweetie a lot of freedom.

Cynicism:

Your cynicism is low.
You are an eternal optimist when it comes to love and romance.
No matter how many times you've been hurt - you're never bitter.
You believe in one true love, your perfect soulmate.
And if you haven't found true love yet, you know you will soon.

Independence:

Your independence is medium.
In relationships, you need both ""me time"" and ""we time.""
You usually find it easy to be part of a couple.
But occasionally you start to feel a little smothered.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/thefivevariablelovetest/"">The Five Variable Love Test</a></div>"

"event","I suppose that is due to the fact that in every house I've lived in, my mother has painted every room in the house at least once. So you grow accustomed to paint fumes. In fact, perhaps I can attribute some of my oddities to a few too many paint fumes inhaled, haha. At the moment, my mother is painting the living room a dark red. As awful as that sounds, it actually looks pretty nice so far.
I ate pancakes for breakfast. I smelled them cooking when I woke up and I was excited for chocolate chips, but they had bananas in them instead, and I was reminded of Jack Johnson. I ate a few but I'm still sort of hungry.
I wrote a poem yesterday, and I must say that I think it's very nice. I think I was inspired because yesterday, I went to the BOOK SALE at the library with Brian. For 5 dollars, I got a couple of poetry books, a book about famous writers' first experiences with reading and writing, a cool foreign CD called ""navaz,"" a Raffi tape for Kendyl to enjoy as I did as a small child, and a huge book about traveling to Italy, teehee. Speaking of which, my paycheck was huge and I'm ready to make my next payment for my EF Tours welfare payment plan, haha.
I've got a nice chunk of homework to do today. I'm working at 4:00. My cat died on Thursday."

This weekend will be neat. Midterms are next week, and it's weird because I actually need to study this year. What's up with that? Haha. At least I'm getting my two most difficult tests out of the way on the first day: US History and Chemistry. I wonder how my life would be if I'd taken College Prep US History...! Haha, I hope I pass. Apparently, on one of my days of absence, our teacher told the class that if we study for 12 hours, we will maybe score a B on the test. I plan to study for about 4 hours, so we'll see how that goes!

I like the week of midterms because we get out of school at like, 11am. (:

Work tonight and tomorrow...sleep, sleep, sleep. Writing letters. Writing poems. Reading my new book from the GIANT BOOK SALE last night. Love?"

That sentence describes my past two days.
I hope I don't fail out of damn highschool...it's no good to be missing any of the review week preceeding the week of midterms. I like midterms week because we have only half-days. But this year will not be as much fun as the last two because I actually need to study for these tests and they will be brutal, I know it.
I'm interested to see which comes first: attendance failing Latin, or academically failing Latin. Just kidding, the attendance lady said that I'm safe from failing that way, haha. I'm dropping Latin at the semester in hopes that I may earn a half-credit for first semester and escape safely. 
So I've missed 3 tests and 1 quiz in these two days, and I don't know if I'll be taking the Algebra 2 test tomorrow or not. I also have a lot of homework to do. That's what stinks about knowing your assignments and due dates ahead of time! You're responsible for them even if you were absent. (;
So tomorrow I will audition for the festival play. I'm so excited, it would be great if I made it, and Brian and Ryan, too. Fun, fun! I'm not extremely confident, but I've got as much chance as the next bloke, and I'll totally give it my best shot, just in case! (:
As night settles over my bedroom, wreaking of stale bile and fitful sleep, I tell myself that I'm not bothered at all by the fact that Brian and Julie are currently sharing hours of moments together. And that it's perfectly okay that yesterday, when he hadn't made plans with her, he called me the second the final bell rang, and then visited me for three hours; and yet today, when they Did have plans together, I didn't even get a phone call. What is so hard about choosing one way to act? Honestly, I don't give a damn which way he goes. But I don't want variation in my days. Be with me or be without me. Kiss me when I'm sick, or walk home from school with your crush. Write me loveletters, or discourage me from going to her Halloween party. Not both. Not both, my love. And please don't try to tell yourself you've chosen one if at that point, you're still keeping it a secret from the world. 
I'm gonna do my homework, study for some tests, and choose a monologue. My stomach hurts a lot, but I feel much better than I did yesterday. And nothing can stop me from going to school tomorrow: I can't wait to audition! (:"

"event","For some reason, I suffered from terrible insomnia last night. It was so bad--I think I slept for less than 2 hours accumulatively...I have no idea why I couldn't sleep, or why I woke up every 10 minutes, and then woke up for the day at 3:30am. I wasn't upset about anything, or particularly thoughtful. I wasn't sick or feverish, either. I felt fine. I guess I was just restless. Hmm. 
Something I find amusing is that during a fit of sleep, I dreamt that I was having a slumber party with two classmates from my French class. One of them really bugs me in real life, so I'm not sure why I would want to have a sleepover with her! The other girl is pretty cool. It was so funny. The overweight girl brought the snacks, too, which I thought to be pretty ironic, haha.
Today I stole Kiley's algebra 2 book and then returned it after class. He'll never know, muahahaha!
I wish I could have seen little David more this week when he was home from Georgia and all. The whole vacation from school was sort of a let-down, I guess. It was nice to sleep in and all but I don't know. Confusing and just a waste of my energy, really.
Homework is a load this week.
Life in general is a load this week, for a lot of people, it seems.
Music brings me so much joy...perhaps more than it should! I just can't seem to find anything or anyone interesting enough for me lately. I guess I'm tough to please. Impatient lately, also. Lately, all the people I know tend to just make me uncomfortable, really. I find them disappointing, and then I sometimes disappoint myself through my reactions. But music is blissful. (:
Excited for Festival auditions! ::bites nails nervously:: Why not give it a shot? It could be such a blast if I made the play.
Happy New Year to everyone! I'm aiming toward a better one than the last, as I would think we all should be."

So, I'm hanging out at home. Could be someplace else, but I'm here. Last night (the eve of Christmas) was fun, I had a nice time at my grandma's house, and the Domino's party was schweet. Cool folks and all. I also didn't get any gifts that I didn't need or didn't really care about, the things I received are not numerous, but are useful and/or neato. 
So I think I've given up on wanting to impress anyone, ever. Seriously, and I don't mean it in a cranky way. Just kinda...I really don't care whether I am interesting or fun to be around or anything. It's sort of a waste of energy. I'll just say and do whatever comes to mind, as I usually do, except now I won't even wonder about how it seems. It's been a long time since I really CARED about how I am perceived by others, but I still wonder sometimes. Now, I won't wonder anymore. And it sounds like fun! I hate the rare occasion on which I start feeling like I'm competing with somebody else on the cool-O-meter. I should do something profane or obscene or extremely taboo! (;

So, at about 5 past noon yesterday, my boss called and asked me to come in to work, because the football game was at 12:30 and they expected it to be busy. So I was like AGH! And I went in because I'm a sucker! haha. I had already consented to cover somebody's late shift last night, too, but I really needed the money. I worked an 8 1/2 hour-long shift yesterday, but oddly enough, I wasn't bothered or bored at ALL, seriously, it was one of the best shifts I've ever worked. We weren't busy at all until like 4pm, and then it died down really early, too. Like 8:00. 
Needless to say, I didn't do my chemistry project or any of the things I needed to do, so right now I'm missing out on the HIV gathering that I talked about before. :-|   At least it's an annual thing, so I can go next year. But the food sounded so good! haha
Now, off to do all the crap I've gotta do...except for Christmas shopping because I don't drive.........

I lost my cell phone. I absolutely despise losing things, seriously. On my list of pet peeves, 'losing things' is probably one of my top 5, haha. I have no idea how I could have lost it! The last time I used it was when Brian called me to let me know he was near my house to pick me up for Miss Rachel's birthday party. During her party, I went to check and see if I'd missed any calls from mis padres, and I noticed that it wasn't in my cute little craft fair purse or in my coat pocket or anything, so I figured I must have left it at home; just plopped it on my bedside table or something after hanging up with Brian. However, it is nowhere to be found in my home. Nowhere. And of course, it's on silent! Haha. I called Rachel, and it's not left on her foyer floor or anything, where I put all my crap when I got to the party. I called Mr. Commins and he's going to check his car, which is the vehicle Brian picked me up in. How far could the damn thing have gone? I surely hope it turns up, because cell phones are expensive little bitches.
On a much cooler note, I totally taught myself to play ""Blacking out the Friction"" on the piano, and I can even play and sing at the same time. I love Death Cab for Cutie. Teehee! I like to play this song because it's pretty easy, and it's not too long. It's juuuussst right, and it sounds really nice. (:
This weekend is kind of full. I'm working today from 5-late, and tomorrow morning I'm going to an HIV support dinner thing with Jackson's camp people, and it's like a 2 hour long drive, so that adds on to the time it will consume. I'm working from 4-8ish tomorrow. Somehow during these two days, I need to find time to do begin and complete an entire Chemistry project, which I have all the research for, but no idea how I want to present it. I also have to finish reading ""The Cather in teh Rye,"" which I love, and write a bunch of little paragraphs on it. AND I need to do absolutely ALL of my christmas shopping, MAKE one time-consuming gift, find a birthday present for Mr. Commins by Monday, and whip up something special for my sort-of 2 year celebration with BMC. Not to mention a stupid Latin test on Monday which I will fail, lol.
Yikes! Not stressing out!

So, I came back to my house, and told my mom, who was sort of irritated about it because she hates driving me places, like to school. I went upstairs to my bedroom to kinda wait, and I started studying for Chemistry with my flashcards and everything. I'm not sure how much time went by, but then my little brother was banging something in his bedroom, and my mom called, ""Jackson, be quiet, I think Kristin is asleep."" And I thought, 'what a...good...idea...' and I slept until 10:45am, haha. I felt better when I woke up, and my mom brought me to school. I caught the end of French class and aced a quiz, then I went to Latin and wasted 45 minutes of my life. After lunch, we had a substitute in Spanish, so we drew pictures of the weather. Rain, sun, wind. Fog. What a day of learning! (; haha And in the periods I slept through this morning, I missed: an assembly recruiting schoolchildren into the National Guard, a period devoted completely to a 5 minute-long quiz (which I made up easily after school), and a cafe study due to a teacher's absence. Glad I slept. 
I still felt pretty sick at school, though, and then I went to a brief Peer Mediation Officers' meeting afterward. And made up the Chemistry quiz I mentioned twice before. I had a dentist appointment at 5, so I didn't work tonight, and that was pretty nice. 
Not much else to say at the moment...goodnight to all who would wish me a good night as well. (:"

"event","Tonight was amazing. The show opened and everyone did a Wonderful, fabulous job! Everything was closer to perfection than I think any of us had dared to dream, haha. We really pulled it off, and impressed even ourselves: the audience seemed to appreciate it, too. It was astounding how well our focus was as soon as we knew people were watching, haha. Oh, I had sooo much fun! :-D After I had nailed my blood-curdling scream and my last line in the Crane Wife, it was all I could do just to fight down the grin that was pulling at my mouth. Months of pressure were let go, and it was insanely satisfying. I had a great time! I loved it, and I'm psyched for the shows tomorrow and on Saturday. Nothing but great words to share on this topic, I like this show a lot and I'll definitely get into the acting experience again--it's such a rush! 

I wore makeup tonight, and they had a blast applying it to me because I'm so clueless and wary about it. I wore eyeliner for the first time...so interesting, and I was excited to see myself with it. A pain to avoid smudging, and a HUGE task to wash off. I didn'd succeed in removing all of it from my face, but I figure that's fine because I'll just be wearing it more for the next two nights, anyway. Teehee!

I need shampoo. It's been I believe 4 days since I've used any adult shampoo-I've been using my sister's baby 'head-to-toe' soap, and lets just say that my head is harboring a lot of nnnnatural oilllls. (; hahaha. Which is alright, but now that I've got loads of hairspreay in my hair from my 'do for the show, I'll need a good cleaning...likely, tomorrow morning in the shower I'll just rinse off as best I can, baby-soap it up, and then wear some sort of head covering. :) I like wearing hats and kerchiefs lately.


And now, it's time for homework..."

"event","My heart is happy lately, in spite of a few things that could probably make me sad. I think beautiful thoughts. I write wonderful lines of poetry. I know that the world is a lovely place, regardless of everything. The world is a spectacle, and it's all I've got to depend upon forever, really. 
I love myself. Not in a conceited way; in a confident, satisfying, self-respecting sort of way. I care about myself, and I believe that other people have reason to care about me, too. I'm a good person. Maybe someday I will be better at accepting compliments. Maybe I will learn to deal with affection as well in my heart as I do outwardly. I fake things very, very well. Nobody knows me for real, but they all think they do, and that is exactly the way I want them to feel.
I am contented while keeping people at a safe distance from myself. I feel sturdy just so long as nobody tries to get too close to me unwelcomed. I can appreciate and enjoy people at this distance. It's only when they're invading my space (literally or figuratively) that I become very uncomfortable. 
I think that I could rest very soundly if I would allow myself to fall asleep. I will try this tonight.
I am stressed much less than I probably could be if I let it all hit me. I've got a lot going on, but I want to have fun with life. Life is rare, and precious.
I am in love.
The future is unceratin and I don't mind."

"event","My dog died today. His name is Daniel for anybody who didn't know, and he had a heart attack this morning while I was at school. He died. He was almost 8 years old, but most dogs of his breed live to be 15+, so I think it's very unfair for him. 
My mom picked me up at school after play rehearsal warm-ups, and I could tell something was wrong with her on the phone...mainly because she was actually willing to pick me up. So I got in the car, and she told me my dog was dead. 
He slept in my bed last night like always, and we were cozy together, so I'm glad to have that last fresh memory with my little puppy. Daniel is cutest when he's sleepy. He was my dog and I loved him very much, even though he was obsessive compulsive and rather loud and obnoxious at times. He was always nice to me even when nobody else was, and he never made a fuss when I secretly cried at night the way people would. He always forgave me when I got angry and yelled, too. I'll miss him.

Isn't it sad to think of the way everything comes and goes?

I hate crying. It's such a waste of so many things. So I ended it quickly.


I would like some Starburst right about now."

My baby sister Kendyl is the cutest red Teletubbie around, and I love her.

My costume is great! It's a big orange HAPPY jack-o-lantern, and it was so comfortable all day at school; not hot or itchy or anything. I enjoyed it very much. Then, I worked all the heck night long, so my Halloween was a bust in that respect. Which is a shame, since it's my favorite holiday. ::shrugs::

I had a weird sort of emotional breakdown on Saturday evening, that surely was a trip.

So, in hopes of avoiding more imbalances, I tried to solve issues on Sunday, but I don't quite know how that went, or how effective it will actually be. Isn't it strange to think how history will always repeat itself unless it's held back with firm resitance? Ponder that, my friends.

I don't know how to do what I know I need to do, and it twists up all my insides. Not the best of all feelings. But, whatever.
Everything always works out for the best, after all. [:

So here's a thingy in the meantime:

Name: Kristin
Age and birthday: March 25th, 1989. So, I'm 16.
Sex: what about it? (;
Status: who knows? I don't.
Location: Merrymak, NH

Favorites: [list as many as 6]
Foods: chocolate pudding, starburst, M&Ms, cottage cheese, eggs, pasta
TV shows: Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Bands/artists: Death Cab for Cutie, Jimmy Eat World, The All-American Rejects, Something Corporate, The Postal Service, The Juliana Theory
Actress/actor: Jessica Alba (is a fox!) Tom Hanks.
Stores: Payless shoes, the Salvation Army, CVS, AC Moore
Sports/hobbies: smoking crack, what do you think?!?! haha

Dislikes: [list as many as 6]
Foods: vegetables--peas, mushrooms, peppers, olives, onions, etc. Oh man, I just don't like most foods, I don't feel like listing them all! 
Tv shows: I dislike most of the shows in existence. And I will kill Dora the Explorer in a dark, brutal fashion.
Bands/aritsits: My Chemical Romance, many others.
Actress/actor: the Olsen twins
Stores: Home Depot! aaaaaggghhhhh!!! it's so flourescent orange and otherwise painful!
Your life:
Who is your role model and why? I don't exactly have one. I look up to people who are genuinely happy! 
What was your most embarressing moment? None stick out.
What was the happiest time of your life? Hmmm. Recently, I suppose. I'm pretty happy now.
..Your worst time? I've had a few short bursts. ]:

Have you? // Do you..?
Gotten/get drunk? never
Gotten high? hell no!
Done any illegal drugs? never
Smoke? never, yuckkkk
Had sex? nope
Have piercings? in my ears
Have tattoos? no, but lately i'm considering getting one when i'm of age. Which is weird because i've always been like 'no way!'
Dye your hair? not yet!

Give your opinion on: [please choose at least 3]
Pre-marital sex: It depends on whether both people feel they are ready to handle all of the responsibilites that come with sex. If they're in love and whatever, then whetever. Just don't go aborting your mistakes if you have any, because that's not an escape route. You can't REALLY escape that way.
Religion: It's important in society, partially because it drives some people to be crazy overachievers, but I personally don't believe in diddly-squat. Not a thing.
The war in Iraq: It's not cool, and I know I'm lucky that it doesn't directly affect my life daily the way it does for thousands of other people. Very sad.
Eating Disorders:  Are wicked sad. But totally pathetic. Makes me wonder about where our culture is steering the youth. And what is wrong with people's heads, expecially nowadays when kids are better informed. Duh...
Cutting: SO LAME. So, so lame. Wimpy. Obnoxious, because the people who do it are craving attention and going about it alllll wrong. Don't expect sympathy from me. In fact, I will probably disown you.
Gay Marriage: Should not be a big deal, and I find other people's ignorance saddening. If two straight people can get married (sometimes it's for all the wrong reasons!) why can't two gay people get married, especially those who are happy? It's all about love, dude. And taxes.
Love: Is different for everyone. People interpret, understand, and feel it differently. And it could just be a fabriaction of our culture...
Drugs/Underage drinking: Not cool. Please, spare innocent people of your hazardous habits, regardless of whether you value yourself enough to take care of yourself.

Numbers:
Of close friends? like 3 1/2
Times you've been in love? 1
Boyfriends/girlfriends you've had? 7.....4 were pretty much a joke, one was very shortlived but cute, one ended with me having a very creepy stalker and fearing for my safety, and one was wonderful beyond anything.
Guys you've kissed? 7ish.
Girls you've kissed? 0..."

"event","Because I've seen Death Cab for Cutie live, in the flesh! They were so amazing. I cannot even describe. Benny G's voice is even better in concert than on their CDs. The opening band, Stars, was excellent, as well. Agh! It was all that I had dreamed and more! We all had a blast, I love them! ::cough hero worship cough:: I got a cute Death Cab t-shirt, and a grilled cheese sandwich from a roadside food van, hahaha. 
The only bummer (and it was kinda major) was that Ryan couldn't come along. I miss him like wo. It would've been double the fun if he'd been with us! 
We got back into Merrymak at 1ish, and I didn't feel like going home, so I spent the night at Brian's house. We had a good time. My parents were not informed that I would be sleeping there, and they didn't even call me this morning when I wasn't home. I never came home last night, and I didn't come home at all until 1pm, and they never called me. They hardly inquired as to my whereabouts.  !!  I'm not lying when I say that my parents don't give a damn about me, haha. 
Little David came home today! (: He smelled real bad but I saw him before everybody else, teehee.
So, I think I may have been on the schedule at work today. But probably not. Either way, I'm not working, sooo...
We went to Wal-Mart today and I got some delicious braces-free candy, rubber cement glue, pretend fur, and about 30 pages of colored felt. :-D The supplies were for my chemistry project, which I'm currently working on. The written part is nice, and the actual mole is coming along okay, but whether my mass measurement will be accurate is up in the air, haha.
I love Death Cab for Cutie! I can't wait to see them in concert again!"

"event","I should totally be doing homework right now. Well, like a project for chemistry-->I have to make a little stuffed animal of a Mole and somehow relate it to Sodium. WTF, mates? I need to measure the mass of the frickin' thing before Monday because it's due Monday. I haven't even started it. Though I know its mass has to be 22.98977g. 
Also, I need to create a ""Me"" box of sorts (like decorate a shoebox) for the Peer Mediation meeting tomorrow. I've had 3 weeks to do it and all I've done in preparation is ""brainstorm,"" haha, and I've printed some pretty pictures and words offline to glue onto it. 
I should mention at this point that I'm going on a field trip tomorrow with my US History class, and we're going to follow the trail of negroes. :) It sounds pretty neat, and I'll probably have an opportunity to buy a good lunch somewhere. Though staying warm might be challenging, haha. I'll hang out with Dan, so it'll be fun, considering I never see him and I'd like to. I also get to miss most, if not ALL of a pep rally! For this I think my lucky stars. I really don't care to watch more people get their heads shaved. 
However, this means that I will not have a chance to measure the mass of my chemistry mole until hopefully after school. Grr. What a pain in the [tender spot]. 
Following my slightly-depressing trend...Ryan might not be able to come with me to the Death Cab for Cutie concert this Saturday! ): That makes me so, so sad. I really want to have fun, and it can't be subliminal if someone is missing! ::shakes fist at Cinemagic:: He's gonna try to get the night off from work, even though he already asked and they said 'no'...
I had a nice day today! School went by relatively quickly, and rehearsal was wicked fun. (: ""The Crane Wife"" is gonna be ace! Teehee."

"event","Firstly:
DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE IN 3 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHH!!! I'm soooooooo so excited. :-D  (: teeheehehehe...

Secondly:
H.A.D. to the one who understands it.

Thirdly:
I'm working at 4:00 today. I guess I don't mind. Even if it is con mi madre. We weren't busy at all yesterday and I got to leave at 7:10 which was great. And Emily: I'm usually out at 8:something on weeknights, and 10:something on Fridays, and 9:something on Saturdays. Since you were a-wonderin'.

Fourth:
I have so much effin' long-term work to do for school, it's rediculous. Expecially in Chemistry! Like I'm supposed to make my life revolve around chemistry, spending several hours on it each night. Pssh, haha. Moles can bite my shiny metal ass.

Fifth:
Is the period during which I have French, which I really enjoy! (:

First Level of Hell - Limbo

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Charon ushers you across the river Acheron, and you find yourself upon the brink of grief's abysmal valley. You are in Limbo, a place of sorrow without torment. You encounter a seven-walled castle, and within those walls you find rolling fresh meadows illuminated by the light of reason, whereabout many shades dwell. These are the virtuous pagans, the great philosophers and authors, unbaptised children, and others unfit to enter the kingdom of heaven. You share company with Caesar, Homer, Virgil, Socrates, and Aristotle. There is no punishment here, and the atmosphere is peaceful, yet sad.

I admit I took the Personality Disorders quiz twice: I sounded like a wicked psycho the first time! I think I missed a question somewhere in the middle, so all of my answers were off by one space...etc. Like a scantron gone wrong! haha"

"event","So I've currently got a little crafty sort of project going. What I'm working on is a big secret, but I'm giving myself about a 4 week-long time window to complete it. We'll just wait and see how it goes. I'm very excited. 
Speaking of excitement:
DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE IN JUST 6 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
::screams girlishly::
I'm ready to pee my pants. However! That leaves me with a very limited number of days during which I positively NEED to obtain the remainder of their CDs which I don't already own and MEMORIZE everything in them, haha.
This weekend has been so...uneventful, but somehow still pretty satisfying. Even in spite of the fact that I spent most of it at home con mi familia. It was great to sleep and recover after puking up what felt like all of my internal organs!
I got cheap candy at the old Shaw's today, which I appreciate greatly. I looked for Emily M. who is employed there, but alas, I saw her not.
How does everyone ('everyone' being those who read my livejournal and are willing to comment) feel about driving in general? It's been on my mind today. I don't know how I feel about it or if and when I'll ever get around to doing it at all, teehee. The only real advantage of it for me is complete independence. I don't like to depend on other people at all. Especially to cart me around and get me where I want to go. It just bugs me, I guess. But money is an issue and Italy is first on my list, far above any darned Drivers' Ed, I'll tell ya that.
School tomorrow. To that, I say: feces. What's bizarre is that I didn't have any homework to do this weekend. When I actually happened to have time to do it, considering I was home. Oh, Murphy's Law.... (;"

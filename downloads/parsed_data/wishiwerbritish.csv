"event","I love my job. Ahhhh. Sooooo much better than washing dogs. Summer is finally in full swing, so I am teaching lessons for 2 hours in the mornings, and for 3 hours in the evenings, plus night swim. Ah, it is great. I get to teach from like toddlers who can't talk all the way up to 10 year olds. And boy, do those kids have energy. Especially the toddlers. In the morning I help with Water Babies, where all you have to do to pass the class is put your face in the water. That's it. So I just run around after little Landon, and try to keep him from trotting right out into the deep end. But he's ADORABLE. OMG, I just want to squeeze him. And little Jovena, she's so sweet. She's scared of the water, and holding my hand and looking up at me with her little brown eyes.....Awwwwwww. I do want to have kids. BUT NOT FOR A WHILE!!!! The older kids are a little different, the guppies class and the beginners, it is like holding 8 corks underwater at the same time. They are still awful cute though, and enthusiasm still goes a long way with them. I am learning more and more just how different I am from the other guards, esp. the older ones. While they're all talking about who's living with who and who's gettinag married, and who got drunk at such and such a party....I'm reading my happy little book, wondering what college is going to be like. But they are all very nice, nonetheless, and they don't seem to hate me or be annoyed by me, although I think they can tell I'm a nerd. Which is fine by me, I'd rather be a nerd than a lot of things. And night swim, it's great. Today we had 9 kids, yesterday we had seven. You don't really have to even use your whistles or get mad at anybody, But it is FREEZING COLD. We all went up on the stands in our sweatshirts and pants. It is JUNE, for crying out loud, and it should not be 10 degrees outside. In fact, a 100 degrees would be preferable, since we have to be in the water all the time. So much for a good hair summer. I am constantly chloriny and frizzy-wavy. It's alright, though, I think I am losing weight, since being @ work all the time keeps me from snacking at home, and I don't eat much for meals. Also I am jogging with the gang on tues and thursday mornings, and kicking and swimming on my break a tiny bit. This is good going into college, because I think I eat a lot more than is really necessary, and when I am away from food I don't miss it at all. I had a soda today though. BAD! Oh well, once in a while can't hurt. I need to work harder at drinking water. I always take it to work, but I don't drink it. Then if I forget it, I die of thirst. What is the deal? oy. 
I thought of taking my In-Style mag to work for the gals to peruse, as a bit of a peace offering, but I Jeff tends to deface them in obcene manners, and that I would not tolerate. 
     Downloading MSN Messenger 7.0 for the 3RD TIME. I AM GETTTING VERY TIRED OF THIS SONG AND DANCE: sign in ot existing messenger. Get told I must install new version to continue. Install new version. Get told I cannot use new version lest I download new explorer. download new explorer. computer falls asleep.  install older version of messenger. sign into old messenger. get told I must install new version to continue. yeaAAAAARHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH@!!!!!!!!!!!!
i have wasted away my life downloading things onto my computer in the wrong order. This should be the last of it, though, because I have the components, finally. And then I will finally be in a state of msn messengered bliss!!! yay"

Ah, the glory of senior year has now really and truly begun.
AP tests are over, classes are designated loafing periods....ah!
and after saturday, band will be over, and so will swimming, and I can loaf to my heart's content.
Gotta start thinking about how I'm going to spend all this time: 
trying to catch up in physics, that's how. Oy. *stress!*
I think I will make some more clothes
a shirt or a skirt or a fun summer dress
I will read some good books
I will work on getting a summer job...yikes


would it be too bad of me to apply for a job THERE?
...oh the possibilities
I could do it.....but am I brave enough?

"event","Well, today was a great day in swim practice. Let me just say, 5 people in a lane are too many. 5 people in a lane are WAY too many when some of them decide to kick with abandon, throw kickboards,  cut 50's into 40's by flipping a U in the middle of everything, and generally giggle and screw around. Especially when one of them is someone who doesn't have to throw a kickboard at your head to piss you off. That's about all I have to say about that. 

Pity the beautiful, for many never learn how to be liked for their character."

"event","oh wow. I am in the throes of the life-consuming lifeguarding class. It will gobble up all of tomorrow, and then all of next weekend, except for Prom, which i will squeeze in, between the 9 hour sessions of saturday and sunday. Joy unbounded. Actually, ok, it is not THAT bad. Yes, the classes do seem to drone on at a snail's pace, and yes, my brain does want to turn every direly issued warning into a hilarious Scrubs-esque blurb. I mean, when you hear an initially absurd-sounding rule, do you not immediatly imagine the worst case scenario? I mean like ""drains must not have excessive suction."" hahahahahaha. don't you imagine all these kids stuck to the side of the pool? I don't know, maybe I'm just not cut out for this. Maybe my brain is trying to tell me to write a comic strip instead, or something. I really felt like that this morning, because we were watching these videos made by the same people as 'Red Asphalt', and they were stressing how when you are the lifeguard, YOU are responsible for the lives of all the people at the pool, YOU are responsible for keeping the place safe, YOU must save innocent drowning victims. I don't know. I just am a little afraid of that kind of responsibility. I mean, honestly, where else do they allow TEENAGERS to be responsible for ADULTS' lives? It's a little scary. In fact, I think I may make a better waitress. How about I just be responsible for refilling people's drinks? that sounds better. I think I seriously will apply for a waitressing job. Maybe Don Vinos, or apple annies, or dennies, or rosas, or randy's, or the black bear. Dude, I have a lot of places to check out. When am I going to be able to do that, though? maybe after swimming each night I will check out one place. THe problem with that is that their first impression of me will be of the swamp thing. good times. but yes, is it unethical to put in applications at a lot of different places? I think I would actually enjoy waitressing more. I think I would rather say ""what would you like to drink today"" than ""NO RUNNING!!"". I've just never been much of an enforcer. bleagh. Oh yes, and the swimming prerequisite was easy, but treading water with a 10 pound weight? Death. I seriously started having a problem. I have been having some wierd respiration problems lately. I don't usually have problems, I mean, I swim 4,000 yards almost every day. But I was sicky on wednesday, and I felt weak and coughy-sneezy. And congested. On thursday I had to run a mile, and I hyperventilated. That has never happened to me, not since my last asthma attack. And then, today, as I was trying to keep my face above water, I kind of freaked out, like I was momentarily hyperventilating. I just BARELY finished it. I think it's because my eggbeater is a little less than practiced, and it wasn't doing all that it could to keep me up. Anyway, I got to really understand the panic and the instinctual reflexes that your body takes over with when it thinks you're going under. I really could not control my breathing, and I really did not think of letting go of the brick. Drowning is scary!I totally understand why that chinese water torture works. and I totally get how a drowning person could climb you and kill you trying to save themselves. It's not a matter of murder, they are totally not even themselves at that point. I have never had to deal with any kind of people-dysfunction like this before. Drat, I need to go feed the pets. And there is a scary black widow lurking out there. Geez, you'd think that when you politely put in a request for one of the manly men to please remove the hazardous life-threatening creature from your area of expected duty, they would kindly finish the job. ah, well , they really do do a lot for me."

Well...block scheduling....what can I say but *HURL*. Honestly, if I have to spend another 2 hours drawing a corner in art, I will throw up on Mr. Bitner's Enya-loving shoes. For crimony's sake, we've been at it for 3 weeks now. I have drawn each corner in the room at least 4 times, and he still has not even looked at one of my huge pile of  drawings. Honestly, is he even going to look at them? A little direction would be nice, so that at least i would feel like maybe I was IMPROVING my corners, so that someday I will be able to LAND A JOB with my INCREDIBLE CORNER-DRAWING-SKILLS, which I' m sure will come in SOOOO HANDY in the REAL WORLD.

Oh, and every other day the noise level rises above, say, 10 decimals, and we all have to endure his staunch threats of NO FUN EVER AGAIN FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oy. 
I am very afraid of what is to come. I left at lunch 2 days last week. I am afraid I am getting to used to it. It feels like finals, or the last 2 weeks of school, or something else far more delightful than whatever we are now. Oh, PE, how do I loath thee? Let me count the ways......or, let's not relive the experince. lalalala
Ah, band. In a way 2 hours of band is nice because we actually get to the songs I've been itching to play...on the other hand, we actually got to the clarinet solo in ET, which I had been practicing like mad...and I sucked!!!!! no!!!!!!!!!! Dang it, dang it, dang it. Seriously, I have spent probably 2 hours practicing those 3 measures, and I STILL could not get it. ARRRGHHH. It's because of all those tricky little exchanges......hmmm...if i tweaked it a little, would anyone know the difference?.......I mean, it's just a little twiddly run.......hmmm.....*shifty side to side glance*........hmmmmmmm

"event","well, this week has been just plain wierd...block scheduling, I was gone on tuesday afternoon, we had a meet on wednesday, not friday, and I will be gone tomorrow.,....just wierd
also I have been living in my happy dream world lately, where, as of now, he and I have this desperate unspoken passion, and he only flirts with the freshman to make me jealous. yep, that's the frame of reality I choose!
also I haunt his dreams and he can't shake my memory from his head.

Okay, so today, I was all excited about my new boys' boardshorts, b/c they are all comfy and long and stuff, and no worries about modesty or anything, and we were sitting @ the team meeting, and talking about how we all love boys boardshorts, and he was all ""why do girls wear boy's shorts? it's wierd! Guys don't wear girls' clothes!"" 
I almost kicked him in the back of his head. But luckily i am kind and not stupid. Probably he has never had to shop for bikinis. *annoyed* ugh, so irritating... to find a super cute suit but then see that even by the time you get up to size XXL, you still could not fit a boob in one of those stupid triangles. 
Also, *shroom!* (protective lego shield going up), I am willing to call it even , because last year I said all kinds of callous and stupid things in spanish, just hoping that something would grab his ear and make him talk to me. SO  I think he was just SO desperate to join in our conversation, that he made a fool of himself. Yep, thats the truth!"

"event","Today shall go down in History as a day of glory and new beginnings. Today will rest forever in my mind as a pivotal day in a long-standing issue. Today I talked to him, and I acted like a normal person! Yesssss!!!
Oh, glory. Yes, it was a dastardly day for a swim meet, with gloomy clouds and freezing wind and rain!! It was soo cold!!! and so warm in the pool. well, not that warm, but maybe 5 degrees warmer than the outside air, which was roughly 2 degrees. So the smart ones of us were just hanging out in the water between events, twisted into little human swimmer pretzels, to better take advantage of our own body heat. Anyway, due to some strange aligning of the planets, I was able to counteract my usual brain waves and duck into the lane where he was pretzelling about, when I usually would have been repelled like a magnet, due to 'they're-too-cool-for-me"" forces. But today I stayed in the lane, and I talked w/ him, and I didn't come off as haughty, and I managed to lean forward, and smile, and looked him straight in the eyes when he was talking, as if to say ""I'm listening to you, even if no one else is, because I LIKE YOU, and I am INTERESTED in what you HAVE TO SAY."" I made him laugh. Heck, I might  even have made a good impression! Yessss!!!!!
They really are a funny bunch. Paul is awesome. What a natural leader. Ah, yes, and Nichole is still pushing for AM and prom. What, does she want me to ask him? no way.  I already have a date, and honestly, who could ask for a better date? I seriously think I have the best date in the whole school. Wow, lucky me. Why do I even dare to dream that HE could be a better date?! HE couldn't, because I would have to go with HIS friends, and though they might be ultra-cool, they cannot be as cool as my friends. I am blessed with the very best friends anyone could ask for, and I really should just go with them and enjoy them, because then it's a safe bet, no matter what, Daniel won't be dissappointed with how I look, and I will have a blast with my friends, as long as I don't get too uptight. I know that we will have fun, and that no one will pressure me with ANYTHING, and that I don't have to worry about whether anyone LIKES me or NOT. But if I could ask for any one thing, I would like one dance. One teeny little dance, to remember forever, probably with an entirely different set of time-ripened emotions."

"event","Well hello, hello, hello. Alas, I am slipping into that little phase where I think that it's actually possible that he likes me. Haha, delusional me. 

He always catches me when I'm all in defense mode, trying to get close to him, but at the same time killing myself trying to make sure he doesn't think I'm stalking him. And then, BAM! he comes out and talks to me, just like I'm any other beautiful girl on the swim team. Just like I'm special. Just like I don't look like Ozzy Ozbourne's close cousin when I crawl out of the pool. And he remembers my name. Oh, if only when those glorious moments happened, I could act normal. If only I could do that, to act like a normal human being. I think what happens is that I go into shock when he does that, and my circuitry is fried, and I can't SHOW that my circuitry is fried by the mere fact that my name just came out of his mouth, so the back-up set of fail-safe reflexes take over. The problem is that my backup set of emotions are : defensive, incredulous, and mean-witty"" and so, while my brain is totally thinking "" oh, my heavens, did you just talk to me? I'm so glad you talked to me! I think you're the greatest! talk to me again!"" my mouth  is saying "" oh, hi. Why are you talking to me again?(eyebrow raised)"" 
Oho!!!!!WHY?!!!!!

The rational part of me is thinking ""oh, what a nice boy. He treats everyone the same, he even makes an effort to be nice to me, even when I'm a total jerk, and a nightmare after practice, at that. THat's why I like him. I wish it were me he was trying to throw in the pool.""

But the hopeless romantic in me can't help but notice, that sometimes he ignores me, but other times he treats me like a friend. That he seems to make an effort. That he seems to look at me sometimes. 
And the hopeless romantic remembers last year, when I only caught ""no, she's too smart! She's too smart"" and wonders if maybe, just maybe......
could it be that we are both playing the same game? both trapped in the exact same masquerade? Could it be that I am his second choice, that somehow, some way he likes me, even though he has seen me at my worst, and that he sees something in me? Is it possible that my wildest fantasy is true?

Sigh. Ah, amore. still, something happened, in my brain, at least, when he spoke to me. Something changed, it forged a spark between us. It broke the ignoring-your-existance. He totally didn't have to say anything, but he did. And it made me miss him Friday."

"event","I have wasted my day reading fashion magazines and I am drenched in the culture! The drama! Oh, the drama! It is starting to make me a little sick.A hadache.  I think that's what happens when you read fashion magazines for too long...the superficiality gets to you. the lack of moral content. Like eating a lot of chocolate. Or maybe it is from the perfume ads? It occurred to me for the first time today that maybe I out to tear them and them wait for the scent to waft up to your nose. Is that what you're supposed to do? I have always just gone and thrust my nose in the blooming thing. May be that's why I always get headaches. WHatever. 
ah, yes. on the other hand,I am super-hyped about prom. Yes, I finally have a date, since I probably haven't updated since then. why should I, I don't have anything to whine about now that I have a date. Yes, I am going with Daniel. Mr. President, as deined by Sarah who works @ target while I bought my magazines today. yep, yep yep. I have never gone with him, though he has been there at every dance, he has never been my date. MY date. that's so possesive. hmm. I must be careful not to be possesive. I totally will be walking on eggshells, for all his chastity. Not that I am not chaste myself, but not to that extreme. I mean, he wants his first girlfriend to be his wife. Which makes it a little sticky for his prom date. I mean, he's my friend, and I'm comfortable around him, and we are going together as dates. But you never know, what I think of as friendly might be more-than-friendly for him. Agh! What a blunder to wreck his chastity for him! But then , talking to Sarah about it, she thinks he's an awful flirt and doesn't even know it, and doesn't think about it, because he's daniel, so no worries! Ack! *throws hands up* Oh well. 
     I am going to look fabulous, I know it. Yay! My dress is really coming along, I added a black ribbon around the empire waist, and changed the lace from red to black. It really adds pizzaz, because it was already pretty, but I was gettting a little bored with all the red, red red. now it is just killer. I decided I while have black accessories, and must have, must have, must have killer black chandelier earrings. Oh, so excited!!!! 
I still don't know what to do with my hair. The dress is classy and dramatic, so maybe a classy, dramatic updo? I thought it would need to be loose and big updo because I am not he tiniest of frames, and it would do well to fill out. But I have my hair straightened today, and it looks very nice with the V. Very sexy. Oh yes. I don't know. I think I feel prettiest when my hair is down and straight. I turned heads today in wal-mart. Haha, 30-somehting caballero heads, but Hurrah! none the less. Haha! oh, why is it I always feel so much prettier when I'm not in school? Maybe because there aren't 20 Million georgeous other girls spending hours to look smashing ever day. Who can compete? Ah, College will be so refreshing, I think. It was for shadow day. So many sweatshirts, so little makeup. Glorious. Maybe beacuse by then girls have wizened up to what horn-dogs all the guys are, and refuse to indulge them. Ah, I hope so. Wierd that when I dress up nice, it is usually just for one guy, one selected boy who I have deemed worthy and not a pig, and yet he will not even notice me, and I will have indulged the entire school of pigs. Ugh. 
Wow, my topics are superficial today. SEE WHAT INSTYLE HAS DONE TO ME!!! Ack! Disaster!
Anyway, prom is going to be smashing. I am still in a state of shock, that I have actually managed to make this glorious dress, and that it has managed to look so good on me(so says my mom and grandma, and experience has taught me that they are usally right, except maybe my grandma lies occasionally, erring on the side of flattery.), and that it has managed to survive three weeks in my house without being, I don't know, peed on or trampled. Victory! although it has some small blue stains from god knows what and a few small scrapes, due to me dragging it all over  the house like  Christopher Robin and his Pooh bear, and snagging it slightly while sewing on things by hand. Also by taking it out of the sewing machine without first making sure the needle is all the way up. It is a fault of impatience.  

Anyway, daniel and I will look fabulous. And have fun, dang it!"

"event","Well, my birthday was a total blast. I have the best friends ever!!!!THey are amazing. I feel so special that they would do something like that for me. SO we  were scheduled to have a group shopping trip on tues, to find formals. But Lizz ""decided she would rather spend her time with robbie"" and Laura "" had a church community service thing"" and Sarah was ""sick"" so it was just amanda and I off to downtown, yatatatata. Then we came back to my house to print out our housing app and SURPRISE!!!!!!!!! EVERYONE was there @ my ohouse, with tons of streamers and balloons and a big sign that said ""Happy B-DAY, Kristen!!! I felt so gosh-darn special that everyone would be there and put in all that effort to decorate and plan and ......yeah. So that was really cool. And I even got my wish, which was to have a cake that actually had the correct # of candles on it. So special. 
Mostly this spring break has been gobbled up in the making a of my prom dress. I was talking to Marydawn on sat morning, about how ridiculously expensive dresses are. She said ""might as well just make it yourself, you know?"" I said ""for YOU! I'd show up on Prom night in a pillowcase and a bath towel!!!"" We all laughed. But then I got to thinking about it, and thinking ""you know, that might work! How easy would it be to get a nice, satin pillowcase, cut the bottom off,  take it in to make a bodice, and stick a skirt on it?"" So got in my little feverish ""creative mode"" and bought 3 yards of red satin @ Wal-Mart. Then reality set in, and I realized that I had no idea how to make fabric do what I wanted it to. So I went back to Wal-Mart and got a pattern. SInce then I have practically  lived at myy sewing machine and at Wal-Mart. But ta-da! four days later, it is finished!It is a beautiful red satin, v-neck, v-back dress with a lovely skirt. I had to put in a lace insert to keep the v-neck from being too J-Lo, and as a result it is turning out to take a very romantic shape. I think I will wear my hair natural, maybe piled on the back of my head, maybe 1/2 up, 1/2 down. I have little red fake roses to put in my hair. Also I am still debating on whether it needs a 'diamond' broach at the V or flowers. hmmm......also whether the bow gets to stay or go. It is very in, but the fabric just doesn't work. Probably I will whack it off and go with another broach or flower, just like the front. It also needs lace, if I want to wear a bra, which I do. also the question of shoes is undecided. black w/ diamond? or clear, dressed up however I want? If I can find the blasted things. I can't find them for the life of me, and I know I saw them after the room swap. ARGH! Things keep hiding from me. I must remember not to overdo the makeup. Maybe I can get lizz to do it for me. Sometimes she's great, but sometimes it gets messy, because my face is different from hers: I either look like I'm wearing nothing or a whole lot of makeup. no in-between. so we'll see.

"event",". Today I am 17. tomorrow, I will be 18. 
So I've got a lot of catching up to do.

let's see.. thursday really sucked. It looks like I may be going to prom with Amanda's little bro. I guess that's cool...beats no date. But I have always wanted to go to a dance with lame-o. Also daniel. Just because they would make great dates to go bashing around a dance with. They're just friends, so I wouldn't have to worry about the whole drama problem. I t would just be fun. But lame-o said that he wasn't going to any dances this year, because they're ""lame, and a waste of time and money."" THat made me a little sad, to know that he was going to be so stubborn. Well, I thought I'd see about prom just to make sure. So I asked (I know, too forward) ""hey, are you gonna take me to prom?"" he said ""uh, am I gonna take you to prom.....I already have a date."" So he's going with some chick from Porterville. I was a little hurt. I guess, it all makes sense, you know, he has every right to change his mind, and I never asked him to 'let me know if you change your mind'. I'm just a little sad, I guess, that he didn't want to go with me. But that makes sense,  I mean, he's a guy, and he doesn't really like dances, so why should he go with his friend? It WOULD be a waste of time and money. I guess it just rubbed in that I can't find a date. and he asked who I was going with, and I told him, and he was joshing me about it...and then, man, I sat in ants,  and he laughed loudest, and dupree told me that I wear my clothes too tight and that boys are going to objectify me, and that made me mad,and I got hit with a tennis ball, and that was just the icing on the cake, and I started crying. SO I skipped practice, cause debb wasn't there and I didn't want to spend 2 hours being beaten and ignored by two snobby freshmen that think I'm an incapable wierdo. Good times. SO thursday sucked. But then there was friday. I went to the smittcamp shadow day, and I got to shadow neil around. it was really cool, we got bikes and saw the whole campus and he gave me a ton of advice which I know will come in majorly handy. College seems like a blast. I mean, It was the day before spring break, so all the classes were lax, but I know that. Colleeg is a whole different beast, and I expect that, I know I'm gonna have to work hard, and buckle down, and study hard. But I think a lot of the STUPIDITY of high school will be gone. It was cool, most of the girls I saw were wearing no makeup, with hair pulled back, and sweatshirts. I felt silly with my hair done and mascara. BUt it was cool. DUde, guys at monache are totally catered to, with girls all made-up and pushed-up and in their tight, low cut crap. Just to impress guys. And guys take it for granted and act like total jerks, and girls dress up for them anyway. SICK. also, it seemed like everything was not so much a statement in college. Clothes are just clothes. ah, I can't wait. Most of the stupid seemed to be gone"

"event","I am going to have to switch back to KDUV...country songs keep making me cry. ah, prom. One of my favorite whining subjects. Well, we all want everyone to go, so danny might take Laura. But she doesn't really want to go with him. I totally understand...she wants a white knight. Do I settle? Sigh..... I guess I am settling...but honestly, I ain't gonna find no white knight here in Porterville. I am getting tired of waiting for someone to ask me till the end and being the only one left without a date, like some sick game of musical chairs, or something. So I was totally ready to just grab Daniel by the arm and sit down. I mean, you can't go wrong with a sweet, nice friend, can you? Well, apparently, Daniel would ask laura or I if he wasn't afraid that we would 'think something'. GROAN. Ugh. I guess you can go wrong...having to be carefull all night to make sure he doesn't think you're taking anything the wrong way. UGh, ugh, ugh! I hate that!!! I hate having to tiptoe around making sure that my guy friends don't think that (heaven forbid) I like them. Dang it , on my prom night I should get to take things the wrong way and romanicize everything all I want!!!It would be nice to think that I was falling in love with my date. Or that my date wasn't gagging every time I turn my back. Geez. And then, I always go so way over the top. I feel so pretty until I step out my door, and see all of my beautiful friends, in their beautiful dresses, not making completely retarded mistakes all the time, like me. Ugh. So dances are all kind of terrible experiences, of late. My mom tells me she just wants me to wait, to let a boy ask me. And so does the delusional little girl inside. It's not her fault! how was she to know that there was no boy who wanted to go with me?
     So yeah, I don't know about prom. Wouldn't it just be better to go to Cambria, party on down with my cuzzes? maybe. might beat being the ""only goosegog in the manger."" as dear Georgia from the UK would say. I guess the only solution will come if Laura or I am asked. So we will hunker down and await our princes,in this demonic game of musical chairs.

another tribute to the cruelty of the universe:
so little miss too-cute freshman, with whom my beloved SENIOR is smitten? Yeah. She's the same little miss too-cute who kicked my brother in the shins. That's right, she called him a 'fag' and made fun of him and kicked him because he was below her. Because he was not popular. My sweet little brother, who sings and hugs and treats everyone like a friend. And all he did was like a pretty girl. Does she deserve to get her heinie 
kicked? YES, SHE DOES."

Artist: Rascal Flatts
Song: Skin
Album: Feels Like Today


Sarah Beth is scared to death
To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well
Since the day that she fell
And the bruises just won't go away
So she sits and she waits with her mother and dad
Flips through an old magazine
Till a the nurse with a smile
Stands at the door
And says will you please come with me

Sarah Beth is scared to death
Cause the doctor just told her the news
Between the red cells and white
Something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you

Six chances in ten it won't come back again
With the therapy were gonna try
It's just been approved
It's the strongest there is
I think we caught it in time

Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

Sarah Beth is scared to death
As she sits holding her mom
Cause it would be a mistake
For someone to take
A girl with no hair to the prom

For, just this morning right there on her pillow
Was the cruelest of any surprise
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
The proof that she couldn't deny

Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around without any cares
And her very first love was holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

Its quarter to seven
That boy's at the door
And her daddy ushers him in
And when he takes off his cap
They all start to cry
Cause this mornin where his hair had been
Softly she touches just skin

And they go dancin
Around and around without any cares
And her very first true love was holding her close
And for a moment she isn't scared

-sniff, It's so beautiful!!!"

"event","well, what is new with me? hm.....well, I am accepted to Fresno State Smittcamp(woot!), UC Irvne and UC Santa Cruz. Still waiting on UCLA, but doesn't matter because I'm going to Fresno. Looks like most of the SSS will be in Fresberg as well. Should be a nice, easy, cheap transition. I am really starting to get tired of high school. Thank heavens it's almost over, and I'll get to be treated like an adult. finally. After being stuck in a grade-school flashback for far too long. I really am glad. Glad to be going on to a new life. A new slate. Away from all these people...to meet new people who I have not yet humiliated myself in front of. Sigh...the relief. And I get to keep those I love! This is great. I might even get a date once in a while. I am dangerously inexperienced in that area. Maybe I'll meet a nice, smart, guy who is not intimidated by my intelligence. It's really nice to talk to guys who aren't intimidated by that. Who are smarter than me. Yatatata. God only knows. I have been swimming. I guess I'm backstroker/flyer now. ok, cool. Whatever. And even though I still get little flutters when I see him, I find that my emotions are dimmed. I know that there is better out there for me. I think I only act out the emotions to save myself from a life of boredom. It makes it interesting, almost like I'm watching it on tv, like it's not even happening to me. because it's not. and it never will. Meanwhile, Manders has a date with her knight in shining armor tonight, and lizzy is being courted by some dude. I can't help but be a little jealous, not of their guys, but of the fact that they have guys courting them. I guess it's just not the plan for me right now, there are more important things I need to be focusing on. But it's hard to be a girl in high school. You just want reassurance. And I know that it woud be wrong to have a dude just to make myself feel better. And so, I am content with where I am. All I can do is trust that the Lord will send the right guy my way, and focus on becoming a better person, for whoever that right guy is. I'll just chill and be content with where I am. And go do some Civics homework."

"event","Ah, february 13th. Here we stand, precarious on the edge of another fateful valentine's day. The dreaded day, the all-or-nothing day. No other holiday is so very cruel and one-sided. The happy sweethearts get to celebrate their love with flowers and candy and gifts, while the,  ahem, not-happy-sweethearts get to ....watch. You would think that maybe the governing boards would have some mercy on the poor downtrodden of high school and at least let us take the day off. Nothing is worse than being the only one to not get a valentine's candy gram. Bleah. So here I stand perched on the edge of the dreaded season. Valentines', Hearts and Flowers, and then, oh then,  the prom. Dreaded prom. make or break prom. I know that I will not ask a boy to the prom. Not even my dearest of friends, my firefighter friend. Especially not him. I will not force anyone to bear my presence. How could I live with myself? Ugh. So I may go alone, but DAD GUM IT, I am NOT DRIVING!!!!!!! If it comes down to that, me, the  dateless chauffer, driving my happy friends to their night of romance,  I will be DARNED if I go to that thing. Grr. 
So here I am hoping, hoping that something good will happen this heartbreak season. I suppose I have already had my one alloted boyfriend for high school, which is more than my friends can say. So I should be grateful. I shouldn't whine about not having a date. But I believe that no girl should sit at home on prom night.(unless she wants to). I also believe that no girl should have to go alone. BUt alas, that is  not the case. I prefer to think of myself as a late bloomer. 
So I turn and face the hearbreak season with an optimism that grows less bold each year. This year there is the mysterious Mr. Rubber band secret admirer. A secret hope that probably is not even mine to keep. Probably it is some remnant from another love, another couple, who gasped and then giggled when their trinket fell into my hands. Oh well, yatatatata. I resolve to spend less time whining about finding the perfect guy, and instead shall spend more time becoming the perfect girl. so let it be written, so let it be done.

And hey, if valentines day flops, I still have my tried and true date, Charlie Brown. Nothing makes it seem better than watching him sit by his mailbox, awaiting the love of the little red-haired girl."

I was hoping to have a couple minutes to look over my notes before the test, but that didn't happen. So I took it, looked at it, did pretty well on the multiple choice, looked at the rest of it and started crying. It SUCKED!!! and the worst thing is that Mr. Blomgren came over to see if I was having a bad day. It was totally my fault....ARG! that's what I get for thinking I'm academically invincible. Arg. But I have learned my lesson, and now I will spend the rest of the semester trying to get out from under it. *sigh*

Also, swimming has started. And I hate myself. Because not only am I way out of shape, I am in major pain. I have confirmed my suspicions, via the internet, that I have posterior shinsplints. And I am soo, sooo sorry for sarah. Dude, she would complain about them, and I said, ""oh, I'm sorry, that must hurt"" But boy, now I am sorry for her. I feel like a total flake though, because I am totally capable of doing better than I did. And what kind of impression am I making on my new coach?! The impression of a fat lazy whiner, that's what! Dah! It's so embarassing. I guess I should have 'pushed through the pain"" and "" gone the distance"" ....I guess I was worried about messing myself up. I hate being last though! I hate the idea of everybody standing around, in a very healthy and fit manner, wondering what could possibly take me so long, as I come lurching into the final stretch, not even running. I felt like yelling ""NO! I AM NOT LAZY AND FAT!!!! I AM HURT!!!!!"" But alas, I cannot. SO I shall just have to prove myself in the pool...I miss Berryhill!!! Wahhhhh!

"event","Well, a very intriguing thing has come to pass: here are the plain facts. 
At approximately 7:48 a.m. on January the 14, 2005, I was sitting in acadec, fighting the urge to die of boredom. So, to avert madness, I decided to clean out my backpack. In the biggest pocket, on the bottom, was an average rubber band. Or so I thought. I pulled it out and set in on my desk. Then I noticed something odd...there was writing on it. It read ""GIRL, I THINK I'm FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU"" 


ok, freaky. I have no clue how it got there. I can't remember any recent rubber band fights. So, in part due to sheer boredom, I am going to overthink the crap out of it. 

Sarah thinks maybe i just picked it up somewhere or it just fell in my backpack, or something. It still brings up the question: who would write on a rubber band? Someone, somewhere, is showing signs of triviality. 

Laura thinks maybe I have a secret admirer. Which, I must admit, is an attractive idea. Who wouldn't want a secret admirer? But that also is very wierd, because I have already decided that I was too loose with ""I love you"" before, and that I wouldn't say it until I really, truly meant it. I don't know any guy who is close enough to me even say that they  'love' me. Except maybe corey, or daniel. But they don't! So it's a little creepy. 
Another thing is the 'girl'. I don't know anyone who would call me 'girl'. Probably someone who listens to a lot of Usher. hmmmmm. It's just so patronizing, so dominating. 

THen there is the fact that it was a rubber band. Hmm."

That some of us will grow because

"event","Well, I feel like I am just now finding all these really cool dudes that I have never even noticed before. Where have they been all my life?! I think it may be because I have no solid crush that I am so drifty and wavery...getting all excited about any guy that talks to me, wondering if he'll be my next big crush. As to the Mr.s Wonderful, I shall enumerate:

Mr. Wonderful #1: Physics class cutie

   the dude who told me that he knew me only as the girl who doesn't like to talk to him...which was so not true...I have nothing against him...he's a cutie.....how many times have I wished HE would talk to ME? In the words of the ever-articulate Sarah: ""he is a babe and a half. and the best part is: He doesn't know it! Anyway, he seems to be a little touchy-feely, in a friendly way, which is somewhat refreshing after all these guys leaping away from me like I have the plague. He put his arm around me and surprised me @ the beginning of class. It was very gentle and nice. *melt* Seems like a real sweety with an off-beat sense of humor. Always goes to sleep after we correct the homework. That's MY kind of man. Don't really know him though.

Mr. Wonderful #2: Jogging-in-the-morning man

   the dude that sarah and I always see jogging in the morning. Even throught the rain and fog and hail and blizzards, he still gets up ang jogs in the mornings. When I would roll over @ 7 am and say: ""Oh! there's more than 1% humidity! Back to bed!""  He gets up and works to further himself as a trackie. I am in awe. So is sarah. *wipe drool* Also, all reports are positive: super-nice, hard-core Christian dude. the downside is that I have never talked to him, I just see him around. I'm not in his crowd. and i don't need to be. Just the fact that he exists gives me hope for man. (Men)

Mr. Wonderful #3: PE trackie
Possibly the only man in our pe class who is actually interested in being fit, who is not trying to look down girls' PE shorts when they sit down(PE is grody). Which combines to make him the class winner..and by default attractive. Plus he can run the mile realllly fast. He seems to be the only dude with an inkling of class in that..er, class. 

I have always known Mr. Wonderful #4, and I have always loved him. As a friend. Annoyingly, however, my subconscious is in love with him, and delivers me dreams about him all the time. He is a pretty cool dude. Laid back, gets along with everybody. I have worried about his family life, but lately he has been taking initiative to make sure he's gonna have a good life. Which is attractive. He is very independant, and that is also attractive. I can see being married to him. However, he has decieded that girls are a no-go for the rest of HS, since he's going to get separated from them. He won't take me to prom. :(. Which automatically makes me want to stage soe elaborate plan to make him fall in love with me. 

Anyway, I guess guys are not all scum."

well, Sarah and I went to Starbucks to work on our Physics final(which is a bloody nightmare) and we invited M@ South, b/c he always seems to know what he;s doing. But he seemed intent upon merely distracting us and talking about Val. THen, who should walk in, in our time of deirest frustration and mathematical needs, but the two most brilliant math geniouses in the universe! A sign from God? I say yes



But i decided that they prolly came to Starbucks to enjoy themsselves, not to do math. (Which, although it may seem so, is not one and the same for them) SO i decided to not crash their fun and to suffer silently in mathematical squalorBut then they decided to join us(meaning M@) and totally blew off me and Sarah. Vasu took the chair next to M@, so that Anand was left with the chair next to me. SO he moved the chair over by M@. ANd they had this little exchange of looks that was like ""OMG! I can't believe you almost made me SIT NEXT TO HER!!! GASP!!!!! WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED!! I MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT THE PLAUGUE!!!!!""

And then they kept looking @ me & sarah, and sniggereing in this mean way, and then whispering...It was like it was this game: ""Loser has to sit next to Kristen!!! THe horror!!!!""

And so, my exit speech would have gone like this if I weren't.....me.......

""Well, *cough* gentlemen, i must go now....thak you for your help...I mean, wait, your not help.....I hope YOU fart loudly in a public place, and I hope fervently that YOU get run over by a Canadian diaper truck! Matt, I don't even know what horrible things I want to happen to you, but I'm working on it. Goodnight and Arghhhhhh!!!!

they are exceedingly annoying 
It's just that, I was trying to be nice to them, and they treated me like crap
They are probably just so hopelessly geeky and clueless about girls that they didn't even know that they did it.
DAH!

SO what is he thinking, that I talk to my teacher about him? Oy.

I am somewhat excited by the fact that he might actually notice me now. And I also can't say that I care too much. I worry too much about what people think. So if he actually hates me I can't say it  would crash my whole life or anything. He has always been my eye-candy-un-invvolved crush....So if he doesn't like me it won't ,make too much difference, since I never talk to him anyway.

Ah, the CB, approacheth, and with it comes the appropriate nerves and semi-depression as usual. The same fervent hope that maybe someone wonderfull will ask me, and also the innate knowledge that no one will. Also the self-doubt and moderate paranoia at the thought that, in all of my 3.5 years of high school, only one person has ever had a crush on me. I have looked in the mirror. I may not be the most gorgeous girl on campus, but I am not a toad. So the problem must lie in my personality. I would prefer to think that, as Laura says, guys are afraid to talk to the smart, cute girls, and that I am one of them. Or maybe it is my wierd sense of humor, which I tend to think of as intellectual, ironic and off-beat, but is often percieved as lame. I draw some comfort from the fact that Sarah, the coolest person I know, is in much the same boat. However, I can't help but feel as though I am just a cheap imitation of Sarah, lamer and less socially ept. Luckily, in my own handy-dandy Livejournal, I can record all of my emo, self-depriciating thoughts somewhere that will not cause me to sink lower into the realm of the social outcast. Oh, why do I make such a boogery out of everything? Arg!Everything I do to make a situation better just plunges me lower into stupid. No one wants to talk to me. phhhhtttt."

"event","Well, lately, due to the general hormone-hyped high school environment and Sarah yelling at me to ""be a man!"" every 5 minutes in PE, my philosophical wanderings have been centered on the male gender, the female gender, and the relationships between them. After many hours of spacing out in class I have concluded the following:

1. The male gender, as a whole, thinks in a completely different way than the female gender. For example, a female and a male pass eachother in the hall. The girl is thinking:"" Oh, there's that guy from chem class that suzie has a crush on. He totally just checked me out, then looked away! I caught him staring at me, he must have a crush on me, he's probably embarrassed though, should I say hi? Oh gosh, what if he thinks I'm checking HIM out?! Oh ,no, better ignore  him!"" The guy is thinking: ""hey look, a girl. Hey look, PIZZA!"" A guy' thought process is usually logical, straightforward, and succinct. A girl always routs her logic through every article she's ever read in 17 magazine,intricate mathematical equations,  and translates it into Swedish and back again so as to reach the most convoluted and backwards conclusion as is humanly possible. We tend to throw out every glaring truth we have been taught since our very birth. A female is only fit to interpret a male's actions when woken a 3:00 in the morning, offered the scenario, then told to go back to bed.

2. Guys are obsessed with sex. They can't help it, its how they were wired. The good ones know how to control it, or at least hide it.
          Depressing thought of the day:

OK, so we girls have thought about boys a lot, right? I mean, we've been chasing boys around the playground since 3rd grade. But they totally blew us off(""eeeww! girls have cooties!!""), until ..........Puberty. Yes. THey wanted nothing to do with us until they decided they wanted sex. Then they started paying attention. depressing, eh? I've said it before , I'll say it again: Guys are Jerks. But I quote my dear friend Sarah when I say: that's the way God made it. and he knows what he's doing. maybe without the whole sex thing, guys wouldn't even know we existed. The race would have died out when Eve couldn't get Adam to stop pretending to shoot animals with stick ""guns"". Ay yi yi.

"event","Ya ta ta ta, today is my very first entry. Awwww..where's mom with her camera when it's really important. Hmmmmm....golf sucked today. I got a 67 on 9 holes. Yuck yuck yuck. Also, our team was thoroughly thumped by Tulare Union. Which we were all expecting, so no biggie. I guess I should be glad that this came when we were probably going to lose anyway. Tomorow we go to Delano, whose course is rumored to be worse than Hanford.(*gasp!*)I didn't think it was possible, but K. A. says that she lost 3 balls in the FAIRWAY! And she's no slacker when it comes to golf. 
So I went out for ice cream. 
I called up my bestest bud sarah and we went to TCBY and shared a pint of Ben& Jerry's New York chunky something-or-other. 
And that made everything all better.
I'm so lucky to have such awesome friends. I feel like my high school experience has been so wonderful that the rest of my life will have to be a complete disaster to make up for it. Even in dinksville, usa, I have managed to meet the most incredible, inspiring, and just plain fun people. And a heck of a lot of mormons. Marydawn, you rock. Court Roper, you too. It's a cryin' shame, all these mormons. They're all so cool! And yet, they're all going off to other places. (cough: hell!) In fact, almost everyone in my HS is off to other places in just a few short months. I will probably never see them again. Except for @ high school reunions, but then we will all be old and saggy, lurching about on the dancefloor to the 'groovy' sounds of herman's hermits. And I will walk up to my dkhmmm and tell him just how in love with him i was and my dentures will fall out into his lap. And I will wet my incontinence knickers. 
But he will have grey hair and a not-so-impressive physique, so it will not be soooo depressing
Also his IQ will probably not have gone up.
I actually should not give him such a hard time. I guess it is his one glaring unforgivable shortcoming. sadly. 

Well, I have always thought that it would be difficult to write a novel, but now I am not so sure."

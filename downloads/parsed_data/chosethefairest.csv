"event","Paris is prettying himself up in front of the mirror, admiring his well-groomed image (Thanks to Sweeney Todd) with a slight smirk.

Once satisfied, he goes to pen a note to Pfannee.

<i>Hey there, sexy,

You ready to come claim your prize? 'Cause I'm ready to claim mine. See you soon, babe.

Paris</i>

He signs it with his usual flourish and ties it to the leg of an owl he's managed to procure, thinking it's such a handy idea, using owls, and so much more reliable than pigeons or anything like that."

"event","Worst. Day. Ever.

I'd so totally be locking myself in my room right now and not seeing anybody, but I can't, because I've woken up, and I'm in a strange place with a whole lot of white, and no apparent way out other than a huge fall. So I suppose I'm practically locked in a room, only it isn't mine, and I don't know who locked me here. Last I remember, I was drinking. Lots. I can't remember why, though...Oh, Goddess. Yes, I can. *looks at self and wails* Maaaaaaaaaaan. Can't this have been a bad dream? And I'm in...a nightie. A lace nightie. Man. Wooooaaaaah!!! Dude, that means someone put me in this. So someone took off all my clothes. Ewwwwww. I mean, normally, great, but not when I'm out cold. And not when I'm a babe. It's just like soooo wrong. Dude. But man, I have nice tits.

<small>Typist: *sigh* Since Paris fails at expressing himself, he's now female, and has been abducted to Olympus by Zeus. And might bother with female icons another day.</small>"

"event","Paris stands in front of his mirror, humming to himself as he primps and pampers. ""Paris, you spunk, you are gonna rock tonight.""

He whistles as he finishes getting ready, grinning at his reflection, then, when he hears a knock on the door, steps back and winks at himself before going to open the door.

<small>Typist: Okay, this is for any of the girls Paris has propositioned thus far, or anyone who just wants to cause trouble. Really, that's what the boy's here for ;-)</small>"

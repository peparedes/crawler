Well, my life is still broing as usual so theres not alot to say............I have been writing alot of poetry lately, you should read them sometime, or ill send em to ya on the internet.........heres one of em............

why do guys always leave me hurting inside?
why do they always make me sigh?
why do they have to just come and go?
why wont they just stay awhile?
cant they just see they always put me in denial?
if they say they love you, why do they always lie?
when they say they care for you, why do they always hurt you deep down inside?
why dont guys see what they do?
why are guys so cruel?
why do they just use me?
what did i ever do?
why dont they just be true and never tell me any lies?
why dont they just see im hurting deep inside?
why cant they just love me for who i am inside?
never tell me lies
never make me cry
never make me feel the pain i feel deep down inside........

Its a lil scary but thats what i have been feeling here lately and you just dont understand!!!! I gotta go, talk to you later!!

Was i awake or was it just a dream. I opened up my eyes and you were with me. You say that your leaving, but you'll be home soon, its never easy being away from you. One thought boy, im all choked up, theres just something about you i could never ever get enough. Its the way that u move, its the smile on your face. Breaks my heart in two, everytime u goe away. I always said id never cry over u but its hard to hold back tears when your fears come true. Im sitten here lonely just a missing you, baby dont go. Everytime you go away, my heart goes with you, everytime you go away, my hearts mourning too. 

I wrote this awhile back for someone, im not telling who, cause it doesnt matter, im just letting you know that it isnt about u jon!

Im sorry about everything and all the stuff you are going throug...i cant really do alot because i havent seen ya or talked to you in awhile. I just dont want you to go out and do something stupid...........gotta go.....love ya

"event","Sometimes I sit here and wonder if i could just type my whole life story to people, but then again, i dont think they wanna know it! Sometimes I wonder what life would be like with my real father...like i dont wish he was here, but all my friends have there real dads around and I got stuck with some drunken junkyard worker! I mean, hes not all that bad of a guy, i just dont see why my mom is still with him, ya know! Its hard to take care of your little sister to when your mom literally hates u and blames u for everything u do....and they wonder why I am going insane! Oh and another thing about the whole medicene bullshit, they upped my prescription to 100 miligrams, and the 50's were doing just fine....i stopped taking them, cause they made me feel worse. I have lost 5 pounds since June 8, and I bet i am losing more because I cant stop puking. I aint doing it on purpose either, its just certain stuff makes me sick! I dont know, im going through alot right now, and no one understands, like u jon!! Were going through alot now, and i just want to let you know that if u need to talk let me know, cause i know your going through alot right now!! What else is screwing me up. Hmmmmm......oh yeah, volleyball is beating the shit out of me, cause scott hall from ptown came over and hes like the number one coach in the world, and hes making us work our asses off for 2 hours. and im about to DIE!! Ughhhhh!! Oh well, i guess its good for me, all accept for the fact that i come home puking my brains out everynight at 9:00....yeahm, its alot of fun, let me tell u!! I dont know what else there is to say about my hell hole of  a life....................................................are u doing ok?? I hope so. Is milena ok?? I heard you guys were like together or something.....you know what....i am pissed at u, because someone really liked u and you totally blew her off like it was nothing, and she could have helped u out alot with the stuff you are going through right now, but you decided to stay with crazy girl.......its allright, im sure she will get over it, but you never will knowing that someone out there really does care for u, and your letting her go.....JON, ill tell you this from personal experience.........someone out there truly cares for u, dont let her go not knowing that there could have been something there that you need...i haved loved one person...and it sucks to know that nothing will probably ever come of us, because, well, there just wont be....you dont understand!!  I dont know, if u know who i am talking about, its mary, she really does care for u and i dont want to see her hurting because you have hurt her alot, and i hope you realize that she is probably the best thing you got right now........well, im gonna go, i have written enough!!

I mean, no doubt I have many, just that there always doing there own thing, ya know! Ashley is camping, and somehow we have grown apart alot in the last few weeks! Lindsay is still hanging around, and helping me alot with ?? and as i am doing the same for her. Lydia calls every now and then, its good to hear how shes doing too!! I worry alot about her! 
Now as for my guy friends..........jon, i dont know, hes been acting weird lately, i mean no doubt hes one of my good friends, but Milena has sort of taken that friendship feeling away from us...i dont know, maybe im overexxagerating (SP), but thats what it feels like sometimes!! Coomer is still cool as hell, he talks to me alot, and likes me for me, not just because of what i do, or what i look like, hes a good guy! I dont have very many other guy friends, mostly guys that i have dated or something......i wont mention them, cause certain people get mad, just because they dont do the same things this person does, or just because this person doesnt hang out with the same people he does!! Its bullshit too!! oh yeah, supposedly someone wants to kick my ass for something i didnt do, or even know about.........Oh yeah, JOn, i thought i could trust you, but you have proven to me that i cant, and i wont be able to after what u have said to her......i wasnt saying that milena is CRAZY!! i just meant shes a lil out there....its not a bad thing........damn, but what i dont understand is why you had to go and tell her that.were supposed to be trying to get back to the good friends we used to be, but it isnt gonna work if you keep doing the shit u do.........and most of all.........the one thing that really pissed me off, is you saying that if milena hadnt been in that car, you would have taken your life..........god dammit jon, why would u do such a stupid thing, dont u know that i do care about u, and for u to do something like that would tear me up.........i dont know what else to say, i think i have written what i have felt for the night......I gotta go!!

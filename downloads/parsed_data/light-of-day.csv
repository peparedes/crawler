""On humanity. Sometimes I imagine humanity as one giant being made up of smaller individual beings, like Voltron. And when the Forces of Evil start acting up, we all band together to form the Mighty People-Tron! Europe would be the torso. Africa would be the pelvis. The Middle East the heart. Asia would supply the gadgets and knickknacks. Russia can be the hat. And America will form the ego! Yes. Impressive figure, this Humanity-Bot. A shining gleaming champion of justice and liberty. Until, of course, you realize there are no forces of evil besides our own damn selves. So this majestic Humani-Tor is always at odds with himself, in-fighting, bickering, hating on himself. A big ol' Robo-Hamlet, holding up a skull, going, ""What is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me."" He's been to the moon. He split the atom. He's made cool stuff. And he's also done some pretty crappy things too. The bad boy of Mother Nature, the one with Holy Father issues. Maybe he'll learn to love himself someday. Maybe he'll tear down all the walls and weapons he's built and get his groove back, you know?

Sometimes I don't like people.  They make me cry.  Their ignorance makes me cry.  I don't even know.  My biggest lesson and challenge...

It is to not accept that which is less than what I deserve.  I can no longer accept sly comments or ignorant statements that go unoticed..or are ignored.  They are ignored on account of the whole idea of ""He/she just doesn't understand."" or ""She/He were just joking.""

When jokes are repeated over and over again, they stop being funny and start to become serious.  

God, I need the strength to express my views and set these people straight.  I'm just one person, I can't save the world by myself, but I can make a dent.  If I can only help one close minded asshat realize the truth maybe I can help."

"event","Cuts run deep, it's true they do.

When you cut yourself, there is a warm sensation, and yet an eerie feeling at the   
  same time.

Cuts run deep, and cuts run dry....

The sensation of losing one's plasma, or lifeforce

Cuts run deep, and cuts heal

You injure yourself, you sew yourself back up and you do it again.  It all happens as if you are in a vicious cycle of pain.  Only you can start it, but only you can end it too. It's complicated and simple.  What's the deal with masochism?  a need for some sort of...martyrdom maybe?  You figure if you keep on hurting yourself, you'll gain a resistence.  You will get so strong that nothing emotional nor physical can hurt you again.

Cuts run deep, and some never heal...

you live in the monotony of causing yourself pain, and you heal, but when friends cut you, they cut REALLY deep.  The closer the friend, the deeper the cut.  So deep that you can't possibly sew up the torn flesh.  The torn flesh that holds the relationship together and also your one injury.  IT's different when you do it to yourself, but some how, it's even worse when you risk it all and get so close enough to a person that they are capable to doing so much harm.  You trust them not to cut you, but they do anyway....and for the first time, you can't bury the pain and it hurts...."

Damn Skippy.


Anyway, I had a GRREAT weekend!  Ivan picked me up and along with John Frame and Dinah we went to the movies to see 'ONce Upon a Time in Mexico'.  We went to CK and went to the coffeehouse too.  It was so great. I saw Amanda, John Jarboe, Melissa, Theresa.  IT was good times.  Everyone was SO excited to see me.  Theresa was so excited she almost knocked me over with her hug.  I never expected everyone to be so excited to see me, but It made me feel all warm and tingly inside.

  So, Hangin' with Ivan and John was fun times.  John asked how Maria was.  I told him I didn't really know how she was, seeing as though we don't hang out and we really don't talk, but that I guessed she was fine.  It's funny how easily and how fast relationships slip.  So, they came over to my new house.  They really liked it, and we all decided that many more movies nights could happen there in the basement.  Then we reminisced about the last movie night.  What fun! Oh man.  Well, we all hung out to about 3 o'clock in the morning, mostly at my house eating cake and ice cream.
  Being away from home and my friends, and then seeing them all again makes you appreciate the truly simple things.  Oh man, if I would have known that I would have that much fun when I went home, I might have brought all my stuff with me and never come back.  Now all I need to see is Erik, and I will have made contact with all of my caring friends who strengthen my personality opposed to break it down.
   I realized, after seeing everyone, that I needed that refresher of people who really help me be who I truly am.  People who I don't have to wear a mask for, and people who I don't have to be afraid to be around.  It made me feel great.  It's just what I needed."

"event","Ok, so I made president. Which makes me happy.  I accomplished my goal, and it feel great.  When it comes to ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"", I must say I have not seen it yet, but I'm ok with that.  Well, my board is an interesting one...

Chris, VP:  He is the Vice President.  He is very well, shovinistic.  He's got this creepy eerie feel to him that just bothers me.  His goals, for his life, are to be a corporate attorney so that he can drive around in fancy cars, live in expensive houses, make ""mega bucks"" and travel around the world.  Let's see, he's from a private, all men Catholic School. (Yeah, I'm not even going to go there...)  He's a bit tropical, and he enjoys running through the cornfields at 11 pm.  When they posted his name on the board as VP, it kept getting erased, who knows why.  He told me he would have run for president, but it was too much work.  HE also talked to me about..how ""I always win.  I love to win, and that's what I do everything for, to win.""  Ok, can I just say...a bit boring. Can I just say that I've seen this guy every moment of the day, which leads me to believe that he's following me.  Ok, at 8:40 in the AM he knocks on my door for me to come to the meeting.  I find out, just as I'm rushing out of the door to make it to the 9 AM meeting that the meeting was really at 9:30am.  Grr.. Ok, so I'm with him and the rest of my board from 8:40 to 3:00.  I have an hour of free time, where Erica and Jeff came to visit, but then when I go to the football game, I see him...again.  He just conveniently sits behind me.  He tells me that I have to meet his friend, because he told his comrade that I was a ""hottie"". After I avoided him for a while, he left me alone, but then when I return to lobby of the dorm after about 4 hours, he's coming in the door around 2 am, talking to me.  (You see, just imagine the average white guy jock in all of the teen movies...that's him.  He's really nice, but I just think teen movie everytime I see him.) He's really cool, and he's a great addition to the team.

Angela, Secretary/Treasurer: She's so cool! I love Angela. She's the best. She got ultra excited today when she got to play with the hulk fists.  Anyway, she's very kind and a very sensible girl.  We have fun; she lives two doors down.

Kristen, Programming Chair:  She lives next door to me.  Kristen is a sweetie.  She'll make an excellent Programming Chair.  Today, at the football game she successfully twirled flaming batons.  It was cool, and very daring, I must say.

Jill Ann, RHA: Ok, so Jill wants me to change from being Jill to Jillian, because she gets confused.  (Uh, yeah, need I say more?)  So, Jill is Jill is Jill. She wants to be everyone's friend and that is nice, at times, but she can be very intimidating if one does not know her.  No one really seems to..click with her or find anything that connects them to her.  Her enthusiasm is the intimidator, so, just as long as she doesn't continue to bitch at GA meetings and be unprofessional then we will be cool.

Sarah, Diversity Chair: She lives about...14 doors down from me. SHe's into renaissance festival and that sort of thing.  She's very mellow and relaxing.  A nice contrast to Jill Ann.  Sarah will make a great Diversity Chair because she is outgoing when she needs to be, she has the desire to serve the community, and she is able to listen to what people have to say. She is a very kind, loving and genuine person.

So, to say the least, I'm excited about what Community Council will bring.  I've been president before, but I must say this will be very different."

Sarah is asleep.  Omega is talking in bed and I'm writing on my computer. We are talking about oh, I don't know...oh yes, the fact that we don't like to wear pants, at night, because it's too hot.  So, we aren't wearing pants.  Anyway, we're sitting here just talking, I'm keeping her up, just because something won't let me go to sleep.  So, about a minute later, this drunk wigger bastard, J.P., busts our door open and just starts talking to us about Jay-Z and how he wants me, because I'm the president, to bring Jay to GVSU to perform.  
  Yeah, can I say SCARY.  So, there were about 3 other guys with him.  I'm well hidden in my computer area, so I am not seen, only my eyes, but they leave out the door, whereupon I put on my pants, and Omega doesn't, and we go to lock the AND kick their asses.  So, we open the door to lock it, and one the other guys is all like, ""Hey, you should come see the Nude Nate Show.  It's free and it's down in room #..."" He then points to Omega and goes, ""You are very good looking."" He then asks us to kidnap him because he can handle both of us. 
   Well, all I can say is scary...Our RA exploded at them, we locked our door, and we are probably never going to go to sleep again.
   The moral of the story is kids...

1. Drunk People + Invasion of Privacy = Pissed and Psychotic Jill
2. Drunk Wiggers + well, anything = VERY SCARY!!
3. Drunk Wiggers + Unauthorized entry into my abode = The Terror induced psychotic rage that Jill unleashes when you both startle her and piss her off.

  It's strange because here, at ""college"" I feel like I have to do some sing-song dance to not impress people, but to let them know who I am.  
   So, something posessed me to run for president.  Probably my pioneering spirit, and my blind (but purposeful) ambition.  But, if you know me, then you know I'm a leader, NOT a follower, and if I *do* follow you, I must know you pretty damn well.  * Know who your leader is.*  ( I know it sounds stupid, but it's a little lesson I learned at church :))  Anyway, I think I can do a good job.  I've got all of 3rd and most of 2nd floor behind me.  Now all I have to do is convince the other 300 some people to vote for me.  I have a 50/50 chance, so odds are good.  Hey if I win, yippee!  If I don't, it's in divine order, and it wasn't meant to be.

  Speaking of Presidential elections, I want to get this dumb fuck out of office as soon as possible!  I don't want Mr. Bush to run our country any more! So, in my efforts, I have to register for an absentee ballot, so my voice can be heard! (Just as long as my vote doesn't ""fall off the truck"" or anything I should be alright.)

   I will try out for the musical.  I will get cast in the musical.  I will get, what I consider, to be a decent part in the musical.  I will have the most kick-ass audition ever!  The Musical: Guys and Dolls...

   Alright, so I have this mapped out plan to see the movie ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico.""  (Yes Amanda, Johnny Boy is in this movie.)  I'm so excited, it's Desperado II, or if you are familiar with the original movie in Spanish, El Mariachi, it is the final film in this trilogy.  I'm so stoked to see it.  (Where the hell did stoked come from? I've never said, nor typed ""stoked"" in my life.  You know recently I've found myself saying things like ""sweetie"" and ""honey"".  My roomate is rubbing off on me.  It's either her or all of these damn corn fields...)  So I need to see this movie.  I've been a Depp fan for years, and this is a movie I've been waiting to see. (I'm not sure why, since 96% of Depp movies involve: drug smuggling, mexico or some other country where spanish is spoken, sex, violence and guns.  Oh well, I guess I just want more.)  So, I've already found a movie theatre that is close.  ( Let me just explain that something that is ""close"" to Grand Valley State is about 20-30 minutes away.)  Now, I've planned out my day, I'm taking the bus into Grand Rapids, and I'm saving up my money for a movie ticket.  I know a bit extreme, so this better be a damn good movie.  
  Yeah, I miss friendly faces, and my friends.... tears."

I stay up in some sad and pitiful effort to watch a ""movie"" or rather to entertain myself with mind-numbing, digital cable television.  So I sit, watching ""Joy Ride"" on HBO signature.  For anyone who hasn't seen the movie, don't bother.  The only thing I've really gotten out of this adventure is the very sick urge to play a practical joke on a trucker over CB radio *just* to see how far it gets me.  

Now a word to the people in this movie who are referred to as the ""actors"".

Leelee, why couldn't you have chosen a script?  This was just some jumbled up idea that didn't need words.  Actually better yet, you shouldn't have talked in the movie at all.  It would be much more entertaining if you were mute...no a deaf mute.  Yes, much better piece of cinema now.

Paul Walker, ok, I will admit that you are hot, and I'm sure you know it.  Listen to me comrade, you need to get some lessons or maybe a manual.  Preferably it should be entitled, ""How not to look like a dumb-ass in a suspense movie""  I swear, every other seen you had a facial expression like someone was about to ""steal your package"" and give it to the Salvation Army.  No one is going to steal your penis, no need to look like that sweetie. (oh, by the way, the nude scene, was just funny :)  Oh wait, I sorry, you were *trying* to impress me. I didn't understand, my bad.

Steve Zahn, I liked you in the part as the jackass brother, who leaves prison, but your motivation was lacking.  I understand this was not your fault, because you didn't write the script, but really think about it.  I may not be the megamillion dollar star that you are.  I'm sure I don't have as much name recognition as you do either Mr. Zahn, but *I* wouldn't play the character who leaves prison and gets joy out of going on a road trip with his, younger, college aged brother, who is simply going to pick up his girlfriend.  Ok, I take that last part back, I would take that part, but only if my livelihood depended on it.  So, all is forgiven, you need to put food on the table.  No, no, no I take that back...you are not forgiven for the nude scene...I just did *not* need to see your pasty butt on screen, in my living room.  Not my idea of a good time.

Truck Driver, why didn't you kill them?  THose were very sorry characters, and I wish you would have just succeeded in your endeavors.

Alright, so I'm tired, need to get sleep now.  Need to sleep....."

Well, for a while now I've been feeling...hmm what's the approapriate word?... Incomplete, i've been feeling as if I've sold out, or as if I'm losing my sense of self.  I can't say that I have lost my sense of self, because I realize that there is something wrong with me.  

You see, after some deep meditation, and actual thought, I had an epiphany!  I realized a valuable lesson.  I came to the conclusion that, simple minded followers, who I've stupidly mistook as friends, have invaded my life!!  That's right, those who belong to the mindless masses, those who are incapable of making a move without someone else telling them to do it.  

I consider myself to be a leader, and not a follower.  An individual, and not someone who just goes along with the crowd for the sake of being ""in"".  Am I conceited for knowing this is true?  No, because I know my place in the grand scheme of things.  Everyone should be able to look at themselves in the mirror and see if they are in fact the slave or master of their fate.

Hmm, I need an accurate analogy...I guess I'm Peter Pan and these other people are lost boys simply ""following the leader"".  You see, I'm not trying to be the leader of a nation, a cult or even an evil clique, I just desire to be what I am, the leader of my life:)  It's not that these Lost Boys are following me, oh no, they follow anyone who comes along...when I feel they should just be themselves, independant.

I have just emerged from what I  consider to be a major depression.  AFter losing my grandfather, and going through extreme financial difficulties, I thought I came out ok.  I mean, I didn't kill myself, and that's always a plus right?  (Well, I guess it's all according to how you feel about me.  I'm sure some people wish I would have done it a long time ago, but sorry to disappoint you, I'm STILL alive!!)

Yes, my depression.  You know what was really upsetting about my depression?  No one knew I was going through one.  No one bothered, or cared to see why I was being so introvert.  I suppose I was just going into my cocoon. I do that from time to time.  Whenever I feel like I'm losing myself, I take a few weeks to go deep and spend time with myself.  When I emerge I am a butterfly that has awakened to the beautiful dream that is life.  I am renewed and strengthened.  

Have you ever taken the time to listen?  I mean really listen.  Taken the time to just go through a whole day listening to what people have to say, instead of just pausing to wait until it's your turn to speak.  you know, if people actually did that, we might understand each other a little better.  We may even...get this!...We may even...empathize with them.

So, how do you escape from a depression that lives in your environment?  I'm really asking, because I honestly don't know.

I try to take the time to understand people, you know to know how they tick.  Sometimes this freaks people out, others think it's kind of cool.  

I'm on the verge of something great.  You know, ""I got a feeling theres a miracle due, gonna come true, coming to me!!""

West Side Story.  For all you theatre people out there I konw what you're thinking.  ""Your depression is due to PPD"" (Post Play Depression).  Well, NO!! You are WRONG!!  WSS was fun, but honestly I think it was the catalyst for my depression, and the absence of it actually makes me feel...relieved, and better. (But the songs! Those damn songs are so addictive!)

You see I sort of feel like Tony.  Like somethin's coming, I just don't know what!!  (I don't know if that's a good analogy because, hate to spoil it for you guys, but he dies the night after he sings that song.)

Love.  Something you strive for without trying.  SOmething you await, but catches you off guard.  Something you expect, but is has a tricky way of surprising you.

Well, I hope I find that which I am soul searching for.  I hope when I emerge from the cocoon I am strengthened, and not defeated.

SOMETHIN's COMING (west side story)
""There's something due any day 
I will know, right away
Soon as it shows
It may come cannonballing down
Through the sky
Gleam in its eye, bright as rose
Who knows? It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
Under a treeI got a feeling there's a miracle due
Gonna come true, comin' to me...
Could it be, yes, it could Something's comin', something good
If I can wait!
Something's comin',I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great!
With a click, with a shock ,Phone'll jingle, door will knock,Open the latch!
Something's comin',Don't know when
But it's soon Catch the moon,One-handed catch!
Around the corner,
Or whistlin' down the river Come on, deliver to me!
Will it be?
Yes, it will!
Maybe just by holding still,It'll be there!
Come on, something,Come on in,Don't be shy,Meet a guy,Pull up a chair! 
The air is humming
And something great is coming!
Who knows?It's only just out of reach,
Down the block, on a beach,Maybe tonight...Maybe tonight...Maybe tonight...! """

"event","Ok, not much happened today...this is my first entry.  So for testing purposes, here goes a Nat King Cole song, actually one of my favorites...Nature Boy

There was a boy
a very strange enchanted boy
they say he wandered very far, very far
over land and sea

a little shy and sad of eye
but very wise was he

And then one day
one magic day he passed my way
while we spoke of many things
fools and kings, 
this he said to me

The greatest thing
you'll ever learn
is just to love
and be loved in return

 I'll write later I guess :)"

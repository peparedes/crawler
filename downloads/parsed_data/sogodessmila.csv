"event","""I felt good and all washed of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didnt do it straight off, but laid that paper down and set there thinking - thinking how good it was this happening so, and how I near come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before meall the time: in the day, and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talkign and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldnt seem to strike no place to harden against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the fued was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had smallpox aboard, and he as so greatful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had inthe world, and the ONLY one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
  It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in myh hand. I was a-trmbling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:
 'Alright, then, I'll GO to hell' - and tore it up.
 It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more anout reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And for starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up of anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go to the whole hog."" 
  
Wow! Isnt that awesome? Ijus tlove that part. It shows how Huck's heart and head are having a battle...just brilliant. I dont know. I love it.! This book rules!"

"event","Today was good; Good - I like that word - it just fits. Its smooth; not too exciting, not too dull, just smooth, and almost drawn out. 
 This morning I texted Kyle to wish him a happy bday, but I guess I got the days mixed up, and his birthday was yesterday. After I texted him, he called me and him and I talked for 1 hour and 23 minutes! WOW! I dont think we use to do that when we went out! I never use to have anythign to say to him, and today it was different - just blabber and blabber! He's funny! He was making me laugh, which was also weird. I really liked talking to him. I miss him. No, not as a boyfriend. I miss him as a freind. He's a really good person. I think when I use to hang out withim before, I formed my own opinion/image of him, and thats how I saw him. And now, its like took those 'goggles' off, and I saw him for him for the first time - its really strange. It really makes me think about how many other people have I done that, too? I mean, there must be so many! And its not that I do it on purpose! Its something that, I think, you dont notice, unless youre being really careful. What do you think? 
 Well, Kyle and I had a nice conversation. We talked about his birthday, and what he did, what he got. Then I just told him some things that are going on in my life right now (I dont really feel like naming them; private things). He made me feel better about some of the stuff that was happening. This whole thing paints me a picture of me, standing in the street, and this is where I want to be, but its so windy. The wind is knocking me off my feet; throwing garbage cans around; tossing leaves. And then I turn around and its so sunny out, and all I feel is a cool breeze caressing me, and it feels so good. Who wouldve thought, huh? We were supposed to hang out tonight, but I didnt go up to washington, eventhough I needed to cool off, if you know what I mean. You probably dont. Whoever might be reading this, is probably thinking of this in a whole other way than the way it is, and thats alright - as long as I know...
 So the Mormons were supposed to come over today and they never did, which kinda bummed me out. They shouldve at least called me and told me! I really dont like making plans with people and them not notifying me when somthign changes, you know? Well, I think I'll give them a call around 9-ish just to make sure theyre ok, cuzz Im so nice like that :) JK! 
 Wow, I really like writing in this thing. Seriously. I would write in my journal, but that would take me so much longer. Typing is a lot easier. This is really soothing. I think it sucks, tho, that this is basically the only think I talk to. I would love to tlak to Trevor, and I know he says he wants me to. But he doesnt let me. Let me explain: I start to talk, and he starts talking, too. He will tell me how I am young and Im going through 19-year old stuff, and it doesnt matter. He will give me advice. I dont understand why give advice when I dont need it - I just want to talk and be heard. Lay things off my chest. Discuss something thats been bothering me, and have him at least just agree. I will talk about things that have some sort of a meaning to me, that have made me grow and realize something, and he will make me feel like ""no duh."" Or if I talk to him about a book that I read, how the book caught my interest, and how it made me think about something, he will tell me that this topic bores him. I feel like if I talk about anything but our relationship he is not interested in it. He might listen to me, but not. He'll only be listening with his ears, and I need someone who will listen with their heart (yes, like Pocahontas), someone who will listen with their soul. I dont get that from him. It really makes me feel really lonely, and I want to move closer to home when I thik about that, or when that happens. Like, I want to talk about more stuff than the zoo, and what we're gonna do when he gets home - that stuff gets REALLY old, and makes me scared that if thats the way its going to happen, Im gonna get really bored really soon, and I dont want that to happen at all. 
 I really want to get a job soon! I have absolutely no clothes at all! Well, I do, but its all either too small, or worn out. Trevor told me he'll buy me some flip-flops, but I need more stuff than that, and I dont want him to get it for me. I feel really bad. He can get really stingy about his money, and I feel like when he spends it on me (like when we go shopping), he's unhappy about it. He never really smiles when we do that. Well, whatever. What was I saying? Oh yeah: so I really need some new clothes. No, not WANT - like, SERIOUSLY need! I look like a freaking scrub with all the stuff I have! My freaken belly shows in every shirt I have, cuzz they all shrunk! I hate  that! So yeah, Im gonna go out and get a job soon, I really need it. OH yeah, and plus I wouldnt want him to buy me everythign I need. I would feel too dependant on him, and then I would have a feeling like I owe him something for all the stuff he got me. I already feel like that about the flip flops already. Im not making this up; when we first got together, and he would get me stuff, later on if we got in a disagreement or whatever, he would say ""You know what, Mila, I just went out and spent all this money on you, and this is how youre treating me..."" UGH...! Im appreciative of the money spent and all, but I shouldnt have to completely suck up to him afterwards! Thats wrong! And if he says something that hurts me - Im going to let him know about it. I dont know. He hasnt really been treatin me like a million bucks lately...
 So anyways, enough about that. I dont want you guys to think thats the way our whole realtionship is, because it really isnt! Its pretty darn good for the most part, its just those times, ya know??
 Well, I finished ""Huck Finn"" last night! OMG! It was SOOO good! Im gonna post a passage from there later! It was somethign that I read and it really made me think about some stuff, which I will talk about later on! But for now, Im gonna go check my email and eat some muffins! 
 TATA,

"event","So I totaly forgot that I had this thing, untill a couple of days ago! Its totaly crazy rereading all the stuf that I wrote last year - I sound like a complete different person. I dont know whether thats good or bad - its just the way it is. 
I see that last time I was still debating moving to Portland, and here I am now - sitting in the loft, writing. Portland is cool. I like it because its so pretty, and its a lot warmer than Everett ever was..and a lot less ghetto, too, which is a big plus! I miss all of my friends back home tho; I miss my college, I miss running into people I know every where I go. I cant really decide which place makes me happier. Washington makes me happy because all of my friends are there; but at the same time, Portland makes me happy because theres none of that stupid old drama here like there was in Washington. Whenever I go up to my moms I have a blast, but this part of me shrivels up - somethign just doesnt feel right when Im there and I dont know what it is.
 Trevor comes home in 10-11 days - I cant wait for that. It's really lonely when he's not here. He fills me up and makes my life feel complete. I think its also the fact that I dont have any friends down here. I mean, Im not complaining - Im not exactly going out there and making them. I mean, everyone my age likes to party, and get routy and wild, and Im past that point in my life. I had my share of that, and Im tamed now, if you might call it that! lol...you know what Im trying to say. Im more serious about life and myself now. I like to read, and talk about books, music, the world, relationships. Talk about stuff that matters - not drama and what happened at a party last friday night. I dont like getting stoned anymore. Well, I mean, I do - its fun every now and then, with the right people - but not all the time. I think it takes away from me as a person, and makes me dull. I feel like Im stuck in this place where Im older than people my age, but younger than the people that are older than me. But looking back, it seems like Im always in that place somewhere in between - and I like and dislike that state at the same time; I like it because I feel like I have all this 'mental' time to myself - to think, to analyse; but I hate it, because it gets lonely being alone. But I can deal. I know Im gonna turn out more than fine. Its like theres this ball of energy that just keeps on growing and growing, and one day its gonna be HUGE, and its gonna blow people away. No, Im not bragging or anything, its just who I am. Like a person that knows they're gonna end up making a couple of platinum albums - its what youre designed for, and if youre in-tune with yourself, as I call it, then you know how you're gonna come out, you know?
 I have a dog now. He's a little Jack Russell named Kermit. He's awesome. He's my best bud ever! I love tha dog to death! I think its so interesting how a human and an animal can connect. You understand eachother without words. I think you have to work to get to that point, and when you do its certainly rewarding! 
 So my new neighbors are being so freaken loud today!! I think theyre drunk! You see - its like, people drink and they annoy the shit out of every one else around them! Im not a fan of drinking! Booooo for alcoholics! Its like people drink cuzz theyre too stupid to think of something else to do on a Saturday night! Does anyone agree, or am I the only one with this point of view??? I dont know...oh well! Alrighty, Im tired and I dont know what else to say! IM gonna go find something else to do now! TATA!!!!"

 This morning I had to get up hella early cuzz I had an appointment with my counsellor guy. He's sooooo damn cool! At first I couldnt roll out of bed, but then I picked up my phone and got a super startling text message from a friend of a freind of a friend ;) Lets not use names here. So I got up. 
 And now I just came back from the appointment and I have nothing to do."

 Im so stinkin thrilled for everything right now! I looked up Portland C.C. online, and it turns out they have a neato study abroad program, as well as a really cool French program. So Im totaly stoked now! The Portland idea seems hella good. I would just need to talk my mom into it, and make some money of course. Which I WILL do, even if I have to work at McDonnalds or something gay. I'll try Taco Bell instead though...maybe. LOL
 Today was a pretty ok day. I woke up hella late, like at 11:30, and got ready and went to the library to study. Then the damn thing closed, so I went to Silver Lake and studied there. After that I went to church, but it got really boring and uncomfortable, so I left and went over to Traci's house. I havent seen her in a million years now, so that was pretty fun! 
 Today was really weird though. I didnt really wanna see anyone or talk to anyone. I just wanted to be all alone and think about stuff and where life's been going and stuff. And its been going in a pretty good direction for the most part I think. I need to get get in touch with some more of my goals and dreams before I make a final decision about Oregon. Thats my conclusion for today. I dont want to ruin anything by going down there, so we'll see. But Trevors coming in tomorrow and IM gonna see him on Tuesday and talk to him more about all that stuff."

Well actually, now that I think about it, maybe it wasnt that good afterall, cuzz right afterwards I went and partied it up for a bit (...ok, ok ill 7 in the morning). But anywhoo, you know that time whenyou go to bed hella wasted, and then you wake up 3 hours later, and youre still gone? I hate that! Grrr! Oh well though.
 But I got 3 hours of sleep, so I've been super tired all day. The party wasnt all that great - a bunch of little youngsters were there being annoying and ruining everything. Gawd, its so crazy to watch 15 year-olds  theyre so immature.I wonder if I use to be like that. I probably was. I re-read my journal/diary thing from 9+10th grade...OoOoOh! It was so nutz! I couldnt finish reading it. I was weird. I was so ashamed of myself, and it brought back so many things that I've tried to forget for so long. Oh well though. I dont have anything else to say now. My mom is watching ""Jane Eyre"" and its really loud and annoying and therefore I cant think! Trev's coming up on Monday for 3 days, and Im gonna go see him proably on Tuesday! i cant wait! He's soooo damn funny! Ok thats all for now."

But anyways, today was prety nuts. Trevor called in the morning and asked me if I wanted to move down to Portland with him. That was a really huge surprise! It sounds like it would be a lto of fun though. Trevor and I get along sooooooo damn good!! just like Brittany and I did, which is really awesome.  But honestly I dont really know about the whole idea, but we'll see. 
 Later on in the afternoon, Andrew and I went to work with my mom. The place where she had to go today was really creepy and there was this really deranged looking lady there, who looked like she was on crack while having heroin withdrawls...sad sad sad. Her eyes kept on bulging out of her face and it looked like she had a lot of trouble blinking. My mom said its something you get from a thyroid gland infection, but I really dont see that connection. Oh well. Good luck to her. Someone should really get her some sunglasses though... or better yet, some goggles. LOL. After my mom got done working we went to the Northgate Mall to buy these really pretty plates I saw there yesterday. That was really neat, too, because I have never bought plates with Andrew and my mom before. When I commented on this, my mom agreed that it was definetly a special experience. It was funny. After the Mall we had to go to the University Book Store so that I can get my text books. Geez...those things are so damn pricey!! It was like 130$ for a used text book and a workbook. But its cool cuzz my mom paid for it.
 On Monday Im starting school again. French 4 (university level 4 - not high school 4) at the Washington Language Academy in Seattle. I cant wait! Thats gonna be so much fun! And then some more gay courses at EdCC. But whatever...I'll live through it!"

I guess Im not gonna be going to New Mexico this summer for that wedding. Im just gonna house sit for a whole month, but I think that might actually be a bit more fun! I'll have no one bugging me all the time, which is going to be good. No one is going to know where Im going to be, so no one can come over. Ahhh nice, eh? I think what Im gonna do is tan a whole bunch, then eat hella food and play with the dog. Yeah...that sounds great! :) 
 Hmmm, what else has been going on? Not much I guess. Im gonna be taking Salsa lessons over the summer so that I wont be too bored, and probably some French, too. Which is going to be eally convenient, since Im gonna be taking it at the Washington Academy of Languages, and thats in Seattle, right by the house that Im gonna be sitting! Oooh weee! 
 Ok, I really dont know what else to say. Oh, Jon got a fattie new ride! Its this 03 bright yellow, Ford Focus. Is so sweet! I thought it would be a stick though, but its an automaic. Thats ok though, its still so damn nifty..."

 I thought I was gonna die today! There was so much stuff going on, and I had to get everything done. The day started out pretty good, I slightly overslept and in a huge hurry got ready and sped off to school. I was listening to my nifty Red Army Choir CD! LOL! Yeah! You people here like patriotizm so much, so I decided that I like it too, but not Americas. Sorry. And then some nifty techno! Whoo-hoo! Happy day. 
 Then I picked up Jiggalo-Jon (hahah my new nick name for him), and found an amazing parking spot. EdCap was pretty good. I was sittin next to Harry, who kept on calling me crazy, cuzz I told him my wish of having a big cactus one day. HAHAHA! i guess its pretty funny...a cactus..hhehehe! And I sat there and this dude gave me beef jerky. I dont know his name, but he's SUUUUPPPPEER nice and funny and he laughs at my jokes which is a plus. I need to make him laugh more, cuzz he works at Taco Time, and has a kid! Poor kid...Hmmm..kid...the KID has a kid..Wow! I never wanna get like that, but thats ok , cuzz I wont, cuzz ABSTINENCE is HELLA the way to  be! Then I called Shane a jerk, and told Kev not to flip out so much, wished Kris a happy birthday, and left. 
 I had my hour break, and I talked to Amanda and she helped me do my homework. Then we went outside to smoke a fag (HA-H!), and what do you know, while we were smoking one, one came up to me and started talking to me. Amanda thinks he likes me again, and I do too. But I dont really care right now, cuzz he's a dick. Thenm I talked to Shane and the oh-so-cool Cory whos b-day it is on the 15th (HAPPY BDAY CORY), and I went to Health. 
 Health was pretty boring, but it went by really fast.
 Then I went home, and tried to do my project. Didnt finish it! =0 Crazy! I thought I was going to die! I am SOOOOO getting a 4.0 this quarter and NOTHING is stopping me...well at least a 3.5 ( but lets keep that a secret ). But when I got to class, the teacher said that we dont have to turn it in till thursday, which is REALLY good! Cuzz that means that I can finish. But tomorrow I have to hella study for my Mid-Term... --- NOTE TO SELF: *Study for Mid-Term *Call back Lady who called me
 Ok...and now Im at Andrews, but for some funny funny reason he went out to ride his bike and not wait for me! JERK!!! So I decided to update my Lj, and be bored here. 
  Shooot, and I should go to Jennas (or is it Jemma...shit!) LJ, and appologize to her for offending her, cuzz I definetly did NOT wanna do that! So, its hella gonna be a YAY-4-Jenna! (or Jemma). Meh.... ok, G2G

And they sure will be. 
  And you  know what I really really want now - I just finaly realized, that I need a little monkey, to serenade me. Cuzz you  know, no one serenades me with songs anymore. Like, Ryan and Rodney have once, and it was really fun. But i am usually the one to serenade myself, and its not when I walkj into a room either - its only when I look in the mirror, cuzz then I can see myself. But, yeah, a money would be fantastic. 
 Shit dude, seriously, now im really really pissed. How come my mom and my gramma used to sing to me ALL the time, and now they dont? Is it me? Is something wrong with me??? AHHHHHH!H!!!

It was awesome, I didnt know if it was him or not when I first saw him, but I called his name and it turned out to be him anyway; he pretty psyched on seeing me too. So I got his number, and so there we go now , another person i need to call and hang out with. Oh, and Rob. Robs so cool. Him and I use to talk all the time our freshman year, and some sophomore. He was in my French class i think. Yes, avec Mme Wheeler, quelle est tres tres chuete! oui oui! But yeah, but since most poeple dont like her ( Rob was one of them), he switched out, and then some how I stopped calling him or he stopped calling me. Something like that. I mean, it was freshman year - who wants to remember stuff from that life time anyway, right?  So Rob is on Andrews and mine callender too. I have to dig out my old phone book and find his digits so i can call him up. 
 Lets see, what else is up... Oh my history teacher is sooo stinkin funny. Last night in class, he was standing up in front of the room, he was all like ""You know guys, you should consider yourselves to be really lucky that you are in this class. There are a million of little children crying themselves to bed every night, wishing they were in Mr. Lawsons class... .. and single women, too."" OMG! Everyone was cracking up sppp hard! It was great. Except theres this funny girl that I sit next to, and she's really quiet, but I still make her laugh, cuzz Im a funny. Meh, oh well though.
  Martin is having a party on Friday. I guess its Dan's b-day ( Happy B-day to Dan), but its a bad party, where theyre gonna smoke weed, and thats not very nice, so i dont think I'll be attending that event.Weed is a big no-no. And I really hate it when people that smoke weed say that it makes them smarter! Serioulsy, just by saying that already proves that it doesnt! LOL! Oh well tho. Yeah..go pot heads... :/ K, time to update my Website! TATA!"

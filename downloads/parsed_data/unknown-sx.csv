"event","Well after many years of being in a constant state of prison ie relationships, I'm free again.  Strangely, I'm not here though.  Somehow I lost myself along the long hard shithole of a relationship.  Although the most recent one was shit the one previous to it wasnt bad even though it ended abruptly and hard.  However, the most recent one turned out to be one long rebound, more than three years.  Somehow I entered the relationship wearing the pants and left without my pants or my balls for that matter.  Somehow I was reduced to nothing but a child and this bothers me.  

So this journey for self exploration shit starts all over again, as if I didnt have enough problems discovering who I am when I was a teenager.  Now being in my 20's having to rediscover what I'm all about is a devistating and quite honestly scary.  This massive void sits somewhere within me and figureing out what to do with it is beyond me.  I already rebounded once and I do not want to do so again.  Bad enough the rebound had to happen with a really amazing girl.  In retrospect I regret spending as many years with my ex as I did.  This is something I should have ended over a year ago but for some reason I could never find the balls to do so.  

The situation I am at right now is pretty fucking sweet I cant complain other then the lack of companionship, sex, and this rediculas void.  School is good, I had a good time over the summer, getting back in touch with friends and slowly figuring out what I want to do and what I dont want to do.  Everything seems to be moving around me but I'm standing still again.  I'm lost as to what I should do."

"event","Well once again another question pertaining to human behavior I probably will never understand, nor will anyone else. I cant stand it when people make a predetermind view on something they have no real proof of.  An example of this is a girlfriend finding a number with another girls name on it who interigates their boyfriend over the number.  Not that I have any worries on my part.  I know the girl whos name was on the paper is my cousin.  However when a loved one gets the truthful answer and sarcasm and cinicism is the only reply they give  you, I feel that is unfair.  Reason to lose your mind over? i think not, but aparently someone I know does. It really busts my balls that this person would see a name and number and assume the unthinkable.  Do I have to write""cousin 555-4329"" on it so its not to be misunderstood?  I mean fine, you have a worrie talk to me, but if your expecting something that isnt and wont believe my honest answer?  I think that is very very unfair.  Trust is probably the biggest part of any relationship.  Part of trust is trusting that what the person is telling you is true, especially when they give you no proof of bad behavior.  Further more, not even having the nerve to tell me in person when it bothered the person all night.  Then telling me via text message while im in class?  Fact of life, I will have other girls phone numbers, im related to girls, i have friends that are girls, teachers, co-workers, classmates, tutors, business women, everything in life involves women at some point.  so to get worked up over the find of one stinkin number, and then give me a sarcastic reply to my truthful answer im sorry, that is bullshit.........
I would never cheat on a person, I'm better then that........."

"event","The state of our goverment system really disturbes me.  Not only does the working person pay income tax, GST, PST, taxes on gas, taxes on smokes, property tax, pays into EI, car insurance, life insurance, and various other endless money pits, and their the ones who get the foot in the ass.
Explanation?  Well then, you can sit on welfare, not have to look for a job, not have a disability, or illness, or legitimate reason to be on welfare.  They get free transportation, training, basic dental and drug coverage, geared income housing, money for food and cloths.  A person trying to do something with their lives, has a job, goes to school, pays taxes, and is barely getting by loses their job.  Collect EI? no cant cause their a full time student. Go on wellfare, no, cant cause they own a car and live at home.  Can they get any dental or medical coverage no, cause their capable of working.  They get a foot in their ass.  Get the picture?  How is that fair? how is that insentive to pay into society when its easier to sit your ass on wellfare.  This makes me ill, it makes me angry, infact, id like to throw bricks at the stupid self ritouse piles of shit who created these guidelines.  Ontario goverment, ripping people off since 1867............"

"event","Sometimes I really wonder what is going on in peoples heads, not refering to the town idiot, altough knowing what he/she is thinking would help us understand a lot.  In reference to people whom I really care about, Im quite sure you wonder the same thing.  Ever see something completely stupid, outragouse, or just plane careless someone you care about did? Ever wonder why they would do something so damaging to the point it drives you nuts?  Maybe I just care too much about the people in my life, however, I wish these people would take into consideration what they are doing to not just me, but everyone whome cares about them.  I see every day people stuck in their heads thinking the decisions they make only effect them.  People who figure not telling others how they feel only hurts themselves.  Silence can be the most selfish thing a person can do in various situations, although keeping your mind to yourself is saught out to be a form of respect.  Sometimes not saying anything is worse, even if it is none of your business.  After all, if im telling a joke, and you laugh, how is it my fault it hurt you if you dont tell me?"

"event","Everyone lies, it is a part of being human I suppose.  Most people hold honesty as a value in their lives at some point.  Knowing this you would think that the one person you would be the most honest with is yourself, right?  After all if you don't do things for you no one will.  Actually.... WRONG!  Yet another aspect of humanity that makes us different from many other creatures.  A deer would never tell itself that it's predator is of no threat, nor would it ever convince itself all its male counter parts are chauvinists.  Why do we convince ourselves of that which is not true?  Example:  Someone who has anxiety or depression may think they are getting help, when in fact they are enabling themselves to remain ill.  Sure drugs can help a person overcome their issue with depression and anxiety but becoming dependent on it to be happy is no different then shooting IV drugs or smoking a bowl every hour.  Is it not?  If this person only takes medication and does not deal with the cause of the disorder it is just like having a skin rash from an article of clothing.  Instead of removing the clothing you just treat the symptom by rubbing skin cream on the affected area.  Would you lie to yourself and say the clothing is not causing the rash?  Probably not, so why do we enable ourselves to fail or make excuses to not do something?  I'm not talking excusing unacceptable behavior which would get one in trouble.  I'm talking about screwing ourselves.  My grandfather always said procrastination is like masturbation, the only one your fucking is yourself.  Heh, fortunately it's not just an amusing phrase, it has meaning and its gad damn fucking true.  We teach ourselves to fail and blame something else, we hurt ourselves and say its something else.  We are responsible for our own fate, failure, success, and demise.  As a race if we do not change out mentality and have a better understanding we will fuck ourselves..................."

"event","when your down and out things happen you never expect.  I don't mean getting kicked while your down or being taken advantage of.  Perspective changes, in fact every different situation perspective is in respect to quality of attitude.  Attitude is in respect with quality of life, or will to keep a specific attitude.  No matter how you look at it, no matter how strong the will, a shitty situation will give you a different perspective on everything.  your choice is the negative or positive out look on it.  I'm Hitting bottom at the moment with almost no money, and the possibility of having to drop out of school.  Losing my car and computer are up there too.  Depression and anxiety are at its max ive ever felt in years and still I'm somehow managing to keep my head above water.  As if things Life is at a relative standstill for me.  When I say you get a different perspective, I mean life is standing still and I can examine what is going on.  I cant figure out what to do or find that angle where I can see what needs to be done.  My life is a still picture and I'm trying to find waldo lol.  So aside from lame analogies life it"

"event","Recently the idea of the world oweing someone something has been comming up quite frequently. Im not going to mention names for those I speak of know exactly who you are.  Disabled is one thing but enabling yourself to be disabled is another.  Unepmloyed is one thing but enabling yourself to stay unemployed is yet another.  However it is not just people enabling themselves to leech from our system.  It is our system itself, designed by sick people for sick people to enable sickness.  Dont get me wrong those who truely need disability and welfare im all for it.  However if your capable of working then you should work. If you have minor malfunctions get help and work.  Why should someone with anxiety, recieve more money on disaibility then a single mom going to school who has to support herself and a child.  A person who is going to school so she can give something back to society and be self reliant.  The sloth on disability who recieves double and does not have to go to school, work, or do community service will leech our systen dry.  If fear is a disability arnt we all sick?  Im sure the single mother has more to fear then the single sloth whome has only herself to support."

"event","When it rains it pours, a well known fact of life.  However, what about when it rains it pours, and then all hail breaks out?  It seems in the last while I just cant catch a break.  Life keeps on hitting, I take the beating, but for as persistant as I am in moving forward, life gets heavier.  Life doesnt favor anyone but it seems to fall on others more than some.  Life doesn't owe anyone anything although some are convinced otherwise.  I just want to pay my dues and start lving.  Easier said then done I suppose.  It is what it is and thats just life...................."

For you, kissing is about all about following your urges
							  If someone's hot, you'll go in for the kiss - end of story
							  You can keep any relationship hot with your steamy kisses
							  A total spark plug - your kisses are bound to get you in trouble</td></tr><tr><td align=""center"" bgcolor=""#FFA5B2""><h3 style=""margin: 0; border: 0;"">Part Romantic Kisser</h3></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=""#FFDBE0""><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.quizdiva.net/kindkisser/romantic.jpg""></div>
For you, kissing is all about feeling the romance
							  You love to kiss under the stars or by the sea
							  The perfect kiss involves the perfect mood
							  It's pretty common for kisses to sweep you off your feet</td></tr></table>

"event","The town echos the past
everywhere I go there you are
At the stoplights I see you sitting in the car next to me 
When I drive past the high school there you are in my car kissing me for the first time
The snow covered streets reveal the footprints of once taken pictures
The stars reveal the night I&nbsp;wanted you to be the only one I&nbsp;ever woke up or went to bed with
I hate this town...I&nbsp;want to get away far away bcause than maybe you'll be gone"

"event","Jack sits drinking his coke trying to pretend he is happy and not missing his ex-wife. He could have loved her forever but she couldn't stay sain for a day. He tried to desperately to make it work, bending and breaking each time he tried to bring her back to the person he saw her to be, rolling that huge stone up the hill only having slide back down the other side where he would strain himself blood sweat and tears to push with all his might only to watch the stone going rolling down again. Now the only thing he is trying to do is drink her memory away...tears and laughter become is blood, sweet, and tears...maybe tomorrow she will be gone.

Natie comsummed by the darkness sits starring into the light, the faint light given off by the fire. She holds the hand of her lover but wants desperately to be holding the hand of another. She loves her lover but is not in love with him. She wants her soulmate the one she knows is not right for her right now. She stares of into the crystal clear sky dreaming of the day she can fly away, when her true love will come rescue her and they can live out their love story; but until that day she will stay clozey by the fire her lover provides for her desperately awaiting her true love to come and consume her with his blazing passion.

Bud sits holding her hand pretending he is wiser from his past...if only he could see clearly, come into the sobering reality that he still hurts from past infadellities. He hides his pain well...some may think he is over her completely however she and her actions still follow him&nbsp;around like the his shadow.&nbsp;In the dark our shadows appear&nbsp;to vanish, no longer exsist, but only in the darkness can we find refuges from our shadow. Once light is brought into the mix our shadows sneak up on us, but really were they ever really gone?

Jamie sits slipping her juice wondering if tonight is going to be the night he calls to make things better...she checks constantly hoping for that sign. It was a night like this sitting on a cabin looking in his eyes, hearing him talk that she knew he had to be the one. His blue eyes sparkled like the stars above them, his words were clear and crisp, poured from his lips with such grace, elogance, flawless in every since of the word. Staring into the fire she wants to cry because he should be here to carry her to bed like he talked about that night on the cabin. With each sip the pain becomes more intense and with each smile a part of her wants him more...she knows he is being respectful of her by leaving for now but sometimes she wonders how many times he has hesitated to pick up the phone to call. She loves him and always will and nothing is ever going to change that for her."

Little Moments

(Chris DuBois/Brad Paisley)

Well I'll never forget the first time that I heard
That pretty mouth say that dirty word
And I can't even remember now what she backed my truck into
But she covered her mouth and her face got red 
And she just looked so darn cute
That I couldn't even act like I was mad
Yeah I live for little moments like that

Well that's just like last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector in the house was goin' off
And she was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah I live for little moments like that

I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank god that she isn't 'cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections it's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions and we're lost but holdin' hands
Yeah I live for little moments like that

When she's layin' on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it 'cause it's tinglin' and it's numb
But she looks so much like and angel that I don't wanna wake her up
Yeah I live for little moments 
When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it
Yeah I live for little moments like that"

"event","today i started my second session of swimming lessons and i want you to all know that everytime i teach lessons i become more and more aware that i was infact meant to teach for a living. there is really a huge satisfaction in witnessing little kids learn how to do something that they could do before. i take pride in knowing that i am teaching a useful life skill to this little children. the only problem is that it seems that one of my ""co-workers"" in particular is not to experience in the proper proceedure on how to actually accomplish teaching swimmign. i feel bad because today in the last session she jumped way ahead of what the kids were actually capably of doing. but i guess at one point i was the same way. all in all you learn by teaching what actually works. another thing so yesterday's update was depressing in sorts and the more i think abotu it might have given the wrong impression to some of you. i am very happy with my boyfriend and he seems to be the only thing in my life right now worth talking and smiling about. he seriously brings a smile to my face in the darkest of moments. he is worth so much time that i cant even describe. i really wasnt lookign for a boyfriend becasue i was headed off to college and there is a whole new group of guys out there, but once i met michael i really feel satisfied. i mean he is such a great person, who truly has a heart of gold. he surpasses amazign every day. i mean today he brought me mcdonalds and i know that it is a simple gesture but to me it meant so much. then he asked me i got home how lessons went and i was so impressed that he cared that i forgot about being cold and tried and fusterated. it takes someone truly special to make me forget all the bad stuff in the moment or during the day. the more i think about him and the future, the more i realize that i would be willing to stay with him all through out college and his years in the navaly acadieme. i could honestly say that i would even try the long distant relationship thing and though it would be hard, the more i get to know him the more i realize that i know i could do it. which boggles my mind, and i hope he feels the same if alittle the same way.yea it would be hard but it most definality be worth the time. i know that all of this really far in the future but for right now it seems plauseable. well im off to plan swimming lessons and get a drink so later!

I really liek the words to this song...Great description of me right now...

Everything My Heart Desires
Chorus 
One kiss, heaven isn't far 
You're everyting my heart desires 
Your love has no missing parts 
It's everything my heart desires 

There ain't no one better 
For me every day and night 
Baby, in my life it's you 
You're my front page story 
Wanna tell the would I'm Iine 
Love with you boy 

Can't believe it's real 
Everything I feel 
Baby it's too hard to conceal 

Repeat Chorus 

I thought I'd be forever 
Searching on an open road 
I had nowhere to go 
So I said a prayer and 
God heard it 
Come and set me free 
Send an angel to me 

And then you appeared 
Everything was clear 
I just can't believe that 
You're here 

The best thing underneath 
The stars you're 
Everything my heart desires 
Don't change stay the way you are 
You're everthing my heart desires 

Everything about you baby 

Repeat Chorus X2 

The first thing underneath the stars 
You're everything my heart desires 
Don't change, stay the way you are 
You're everything my heart desires 
One kiss heaven isn't far

I Wanna Be With You

"event","i made a decision this weekend that has releived soem stress of my back. i am deathly afraid to college! why? i have no clue! its funny, i have always dreamed of the day that i go to college and experience that lifestyle. however as the day draws closer to me actually living that dream i get scared. this world is a scary place and lots of mean people doing mean things to people. which is sad because that's mean! why cant the world just be nice to each other. maybe im afraid to go to college becasue i look at my parents, seeign all the dreams they once had but failed to reached for one reason or the other. i notice with each passing year their body's begin to worsen just a little bit more with each passign year. i wonder if when they were my age did they have expectations of themselves that they failed accomplish. then i ask myself if im completely satisfied with the career i have chosen. do i even grow up and get older. i mean i do but hten i dont. i want to experience the wonders of having children and getting married and watching my children grow up. at the same time i wonder if im actually ready for the responciblity of being a grown up:why must i get older? idk...there are so many reasons why im scared but i have decided that going to franklin is my best bet to expereince the college atmostphere and still be fine...not so much scared about it!

"event","there is a door that was going to remain shut for awhile. in remaining shut it would save the heart from heart ache, it would allow those parts to heal that were scared form the last time it was opened. by remaining shut this door would would hurt no one and save the one who's door it belonged to. if that door remained shut then no one could see the mess in there that was made from the last occupant. the builders could go in and fix the holds, paint over the marks, rip up the floor and put a new one down, and build up some walls that had been torn down. this door kept all of this under wrapes. the key that opened the door had been thrown away becasue it was old and had too many old memories. a new key was going to be made becasue a new door was in the process of being refitted. while all of this was going on something happen; that door was opened by a secret key that was found in a pocket. this key opened that door and the new occupant took a look around. he saw some of the devistation that had been caused. he looked at the holes, examied the remains of some a few broken down walls, stepped over the holes and with out saying a word began to fix some of the trouble spots. he started by patching the huge, gapping holes in the walls. then he picked up the can of paint, with a new color, he repainted the whole inside. after painting, began his work on the crusal parts of the mess, the floor and torn down walls. this was the hardest task because he knew these could not be fixed over night. slowly, the walls began to start being built up, though not entirely finished, they are getting closer everyday. the floor has been worked on, still needs some more work, but it is a far cry from where it use to be. he has begun to put funiture and hang some memories on the wall. though it will take some time for the finished project, the occupant doesnt seem to care. which i can only see as a good thing. so thank you to the occupant!"

Time to squeeze into the swimming suit that is two sizes to small then it should be. But it is just right for teh big meet. Put the those sandles on because the pool deck ans the locker room floor is really groose. Grab teh royal, or at least was royal blue in its earlier years, swimming parka to keep your muscles warm before your event. Have to have a swimming cap and goggles. Put the cap on first, can't swim fast without it. Then comes the goggles, have to be able to see where im going. Grab the towel to hide your face in, when you get done with the race. Put your favorite CD on and chill before your race. Race time, the nerves are going crazy, the butterflies are pounding against the inside of the stomach. Muscles are tensing, legs are shaking, coaches last minutes reminders running through your head, ""head down, long, low, fast, arms, breath everyother stroke, last stroke should be the best."" The call to the block, the call to the block, the silence, anticipation, still water, it is about to happen. The whistle, teh race has begun, into the water the swimmers go. The heart is racing, the muscles are aching, lungs burning, need a breath. Almost there!There is the end, yellow pad, last stroke to be the best.....Great Finish! Coach yelling, the crowd is cheering, you out of breath then look up at the scoreboard...........
~new thoguht~
would u lie to me to save me from heart ache? would you try to protect from something that i can handle? would you hide your feelings so that it would be easier on me? would you tell me you are there for me but when i need you would you be there? when you listen to my problems are you actually listening? when you call me your friend do you honestly mean that? when you say that you trust me are you telling me the truth? in your time of need would i be the first person to run through your mind when you need help? would you call me and ask for help knowing that i would do my best to help you? would you stand by my side when the world has turned against me? would pick me up if i fall? would you wipe away my tears and reassure me that everything is going to be ok? im the same manner do you count on me to pick you up when u fall, cuz i will? does my smile make you smile? are you really my friend?"

A time when letting people inside was not do able. when the thought of finding someoen i could trust was so far away it was almost didnt exsit. would it help u to know that i understand what its like? well heres my story:
seventh grade year a real good guy friend of mine came back to franklin. he had moved to texas in the middle of his and mine fifth grade year. well between fifth grade and my freshman year in high school i battled mild depression. i had lost two people in car accients taht meant quit alot to me. this was real hard for me to deal with. i really didnt talk abotu any of my feelings. i jsut kept them bottled up. but anyways back to my story. so this guy moved back and i really liked him. well i told a freind who in turn told another and then they told him. i found out that he liked me and one thing led to another and we became boyfriend and girlfriend. which was real cool! the ""relationship"" was goin ok but we never really connected. it wasnt his fault by any means. i jsut didnt let him knwo about the issues i had bottled up. needless to say the ""realtionship"" ended becasue i never let him knwo what was bothering me.  i never trusted him to understand. it wasnt only him that i guarded myself from, i didnt let ANYONE knwo that i was struggling. i always figured that no one would understand.
 u knwo i lost two people who meant alot to me in a short period of tiem. i was so worried about getting close to someone and then losing them that i failed to see that what i actually needed was someone to open up to. someoen that i knew i could count on in my tiem of need. someone who would say u can come to me and tell me anything and i wont judge you. ill accept u for who u are. its taken awhile but i think ive reached apoint in my life where i can say that i am happy.im happy because i learned to open up. i learned that the keepign issues all bottled up only made them worse. believe it or not there are people in this world who have been through something similar to u and they knwo how to help. the hardest part is askign for help. i understand that there comes a time when u have to deal with soem internal issues. i been there, done that. dont think i dont understand cuz i do. but i have found that it only gets worse by dealing with them solo. i knwo u need tiem to deal with them thats understandable. but always remember that no matter what, if its today, tomorrow or three years from now, 3 in the morning and i have to be up at 5, i am here for u and everyone else. i will alway drop what im doing to help those who need it. i will try to be ur foundation when urs starts to crumble, i will pick u up when u fall, u will always have a strong arm and a shoulder to be there for u. 
well im off to watch ALADIN marathon! hooray! i love those movies! jsut remember that im here for u all!

Then make you want to cry

The tears of joy for all the

I feel so happy when Im around you and its nothing ive experienced before. I feel like i can ask all the interesting questions i want even when they are completely random. Its awesome to know that you dont find it annoying, when most people do. Its cool to know that you will be there to cheer me up when im sad. You will be there when i need a stable place to stand when i begin to fall. I feel carefree when im around you. I dont have to worry about how im kissing or if im doing something retared, cause it doesnt matter to you. You see me as an individual and not just anyother pretty face. We can sit down and have just much as much fun as if we were doing soemthing. I have been good at explaining my feelings with words but all i know is that i wish i could. I wish i could explain this feeling i have for you!

"event","I never thought it could happen. I never thougth that with one kiss you could leave me out of breath. Sitting there in your arms beign so close to you I felt myself slowly letting go of all the fear i had. Until now i wanted to let go of it, and let someone inside. When i felt your lips touch mine and your hand resting on mine i knew i couldnt hold back any longer. the feeling i got ran through my spine and made every part of my body more sensitive then usual. The way you held me and the way your lips caressed mine left me breathless. I flet like me, the me that wasnt afraid in any way to let you in. This was the me that i had lost earlier but now i have found. this was the first time that i didnt think about what i was doin and i let it happen! i feel more at ease now and i knwo that u noticed that. so thanx for bringing me out of my shell and leaving me breathless!

"event","On Tuesday night I began the next chapter of my life. This is going to be,by far, the most exciting chapter yet! I have found somebody that for the first time in a long time, I don't feel like I have to be someone I'm not. Michael likes me for who I am even when I am having my dumb moments. I don't feel like I have to be mature or always talking when I'm around him! Its interestign because for the first time I feel like I can have a social life and a boyfriend at the same time. We can go our seperate ways and have fun then we can come back together and have just as much fun together. I'm so not use to that! My last relationship I felt as if I were committing a crime by leaving his side and that made it less enjoyable each day. But I guess I need to start living in the present and enjoy this new beginning because its something special and I can't wait to see where it will lead!

"event","I am standing at a crossroad facing a sign with two arrows pointing different ways. On way says ""Doctor's Office"" and the other says ""Home."" Which do i choose, God? If I choose the ""Home"" path then I am just putting off the inevitable. I know it would be the easy way out. I would be avoiding the problem and might make it worse. I have learned through your hands that avoiding the problem only leads to bigger problems. So I guess following the ""Home"" arrow would not be the choice. If I choose the ""Doctor's Office"" path,  I am facing a chance of being told that I am fine or that I have a problem. If I am fine then I made this a bigger deal then it is. If however, they find a problem, I am left with the decision about what I should do about it. I already have an idea of what can be done, but the decision now comes what am I going to do about it? Will i learn to live with it and deal with it as it comes or will I pursue more drastic measures if that's an option?  What is the best choice? I ask you God, what is the best choice? I know that you and you alone know what the future holds. I know that you will never put me through something that I can't handle. And if I know that you have a reason for doing what you do and I respect that. But for right now, if there is something wrong with me, I need to know are you going to help me make the right choice? I am putting all my faith that I have in you and praying that whatever ends up happening it is what you intended and that I will have the strength do deal with it in a positive manner. I will just have to keep my head up and my trust in you."

"event","i have never experienced a good first kiss. They are always ruined by either lack of experience, not being on the same page as the other one, or flat out just not right! i have always been afraid to experience that first kiss. its always so awkward but for the first time didn't experience that. its kind of funny how one person can make something as small as a kiss so meaningful. it lasted for a second but it was the best second ive had in a long time. and i thank you for that michael!"

"event","today as i realized that senior night is just days away i wonder what i am goin to then. swimming has been that thing that i was good at and i loved to doit no matter how hard it got. in away it shaped me to the person i am today. i was told by beth ann's dad that hardest part about growing up is learning to close that chapter in ur life when it comes time to. which is what im going to have to do. idk i guess i will always have those memories and my teammates when ever i want to look back! so i guess i should enjoy my last days and then close that chapter and look to the future and take every expereince with a positive outlook! 
off to bed now i have morn practice! 
fun!!"

"event","The past year and half has been one hell of a learning experience. I mean being in a relationship that was less then healthy by any standards. Followed by my trying to end it and having two wonderful people help me without even knowing it. And learning how to be me and not care what others think. All that together makes for one hell of a learning experience. The more i think about it the more i begin to realize that maybe God put me through all this so that i could learn more about myself so that someday i might make a difference down the road somewhere. I guess only time will tell what I was supposed do with the knowledge from this experience. It was Eleanor Roosevelt who said "" You have to accept whatever comes your way and the only important thing is that you meet it with  courage and with the best you have to give."" I honestly believe that is one thing to keep in mind whenever you get in a situation and need some encouraging advice."

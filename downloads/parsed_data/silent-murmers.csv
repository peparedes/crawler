"event","You know, I knew that posting my feelings and thoughts and various other things would open me up to shit from people, but I guess I had a little more faith than I should have, in that at least those that had a problem with something I chose to add to my journal...which no one is under any obligation to read anyways...would at least have the guts to put their name with their words.  But no, once again I see chicken shit people hiding behind their anonimity.  So, I am now going to go the route I had at one time believed unnecessary, and all future posts will be friends only, including all the gross and icky quizzes that are intended for a fucking laugh and not to be taken seriously.  Those of you already on my friends list, you will continue to stay there...you guys are all wonderful, and I love sharing things back and forth with you!!  If you've been viewing the few posts I've left open, and would like access to the rest...let me know, and most likely you'll be added.  The rest of you can just bite my ass, and there's more than enough of it to go around, so enjoy!!  Have a nice day!! :)"

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v472/dtyrant11/harry.jpg"" /></center>

i heard that the cover is a wraparound. on the back cover we'll see outstretched spidery hands toward Harry. when the book is opened though, we'll see a powerful image of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named with red glowing eyes peering out from his hood.

i really have a gut feeling that he's gonna die in this book. i really couldn't think of a way for JK to prevent anyone from making a sequel to the story if she won't kill harry. i have another theory though - <i>harry, in order to kill voldemort, will use some sort of magic which will use up all of his powers that in the end he will lose all of his magic skills, then they will modify his memory so that he can live as a muggle</i>. but my instincts (and jk's subtle hints) are telling me that jk's going to <u>murder</u> him. (why did jk ""mourn"" after she finished the book? why, in addressing a question about harry's future, did she reply ""why are you assuming that harry's going to live that long?"")

i do hope that jk tied all loose ends in the story (which side is snape on, why did the Potters live in the godric's hollow, is R.A.B. really Regulus A. Black, is sirius/dumbledore really dead, etc). and if ever (swallows) harry will really die, i do hope that in doing so, he can permanently get rid of big bad voldemort.

i can't wait to read this!"

so whats new with me?

DTV is so last season. i have been transferred to another site (CVG Commonwealth) and to a better, cooler and more challenging account - General Motors. i looove it!!! avail time is ranging from 3 mins - more than an hour, average handling time is 19 minutes and we're not even a technical account (we do basic troubleshoting, basic inquiries and problem documentation.) i love my job, and i never thought i'd ever say that.

i am so over <b>him</b>. in fact, it was his birthday yesterday, but i didn't even budge. but theres another guy though, long story. check out my multiply for details na lang (http://wickedangel1.multiply.com).

and of course, i turned 22 recently. so i guess i'm more matured now. (you wish hehehe).

"event","recently, i've been noticing the changes my life have been going through these past few months. aside from gaining extra weight due to binging on sweets (mental note to self: lose that habit!), I also have a different point of view about certain things now. I'm gonna try to enumerate them as much as I can.

Friends

I believe that I already know how to separate the true ones from the vultures. There are these people I believed to be my friends but instead they turn out to be back stabbers and people who judge me for the things about me that they don't fully understand. I have said this a lot of times, but my personality is far from being conventional. At first, I felt inferior because that they consider me as a freak, it helped me in some way though. but after sometime i realized that if i can't be myself with them, i can never call them friends in the first place. there are a lot of people who were able to understand my personality and they don't judge me or say things behind me. that alone brought back the confidence i almost lost. in fact, i met a lot of new friends and appreciated the old ones even more. i feel vindicated because of this.

Love

I can now safely say that I have finally gotten over him. coincidentally, I realized it the night that I got myself wounded due to a pool accident. the wound is now fully healed and the scar looks ugly, but that's okay. i finally understand that wounds really do heal, even the deepest ones. I know that I will forever be emotionally scarred. sebo de macho might make the scar in my left leg go away, but the scar in my heart can never be erased . he taught me a lot of things on life, being that ours was a complicated case. i've moved on, yes, but he will always have a special place in my heart.

Work

Okay, the change is so obvious hehehe. I was moved to another account, which is easier than my previous account. This isn't a demotion though. I feel like this is my reward for holding on, for not giving up. I just hope that i will be able to prove what i'm made of to other people at work now.

Faith

I'm not kidding. with this new hope He gave me, i guess my faith in Him became stronger. eventually, in His own time, everything will be alright. I don't have to hurry.

... and more changes will happen in the next few months. they are changes for the better though. watch out for the revitalized Pam, coming soon. (hehehe.) change is inevitable, as a quote states, and i'm just gonna go with it. cheers to a better me."

i've been an agent for more than a year. my stats aren't that bad and i've been shortlisted for several positions already. but why am i still an agent?

nobody in our batch has been promoted yet(one was almost promoted, if only office politics did not interfere.) and i'm actually getting tired of taking calls.

is it time for me to get out of this industry? what am i gonna do for living then?

my mom's offering me a job in the phil senate. the salary's competitive, but with the cha-cha threat, there's no security of tenure. sure, i could work for another gov't institution, but will it promise the same salary and type of job that the senate position offers?

"event","DISCLAIMER: i'm not bragging okay (i've been recently tagged as mayabang because of some stuff i bought, so this isn't intended to make yabang ok?). i'm just confused, really.

a month ago, i bought a nokia n70. well, of course i love this phone because it has 2 megapixel main camera with flash and a vga camera on the front, has expandable memory that i use for my mp3 files (the reason why i forever bade goodbye to my dreams of buying an ipod) and kinda okay sound quality. i was intending to stick with it but then here comes nokia n91.

what makes me drool about the n91 is that it has 4gig of internal memory which they say ""killed"" the ipod industry (that's according to the reviews i read okay? my apologies to ipod fanatics). plus it is really intended to be a music phone - a 3.5 mm stereo jack which is not available with other nokia phones, a mixer, the location of the headphone jack and the Hold button is placed at the top of the handset which makes it identical to most mp3 players, slide design with dedicated playback and volume control keys including play / pause, forward, back and stop... i just wanted to drop my n70 and get one! my friend actually offered it to me for a low price courtesy of their company's promo. so what's holding me back??

well, first of all, although n91 is one heck of a music phone and i happen to be a music freak, i'm also known for my constant camwhoring whenever it's possible. and i guess that's why i decided to get the n70. and although n91 also has a 2mp camera, it doesn't have flash attached to it!!! and that's something that i love about the n70. and right now i'm satisfied with my music files courtesy of the 512 rs mmc that i bought 2 weeks ago. and also, it's a slide and metallic phone. i'm really a very clumsy person so i can just imagine the damage and scratches i'd bring to the phone. (and thanks to my crystal case, my n70 is still flawless.) 

so i really need help right now. HELP ME DECIDE GUYS!!!!"

""pam, i just finished your scorecard for the month of may. sayang, all of your metrics are perfect (gosh, including sales??) except for your absenteeism rate.""

"event","people who know me really well are very much aware of this trait of mine. don't get me wrong though. it's not the type of envy wherein i'll do evil things (like crab mentality, back stabbing, etc.)just to pacify myself. it's more like if i see something/situation that i really like, i'd want to get one for myself or i'd want to be on the same level/situation. ergo, it motivates me to trek a certain path.

right now, i really envy people who can do what they really want without jeopardizing their financial status. and i'm not talking about being able to go clubbing or having fun because i can do that. what i mean is i really want to be doing something else in my life and due to financial constraints, i need to postpone that to a later time, God knows when.

after working in a call center for more than a year and at the same time hear stories from friends, close ones and acquaintances alike, about being in law school, being able to participate in debate tourneys even if they already graduated or simply being in a kind of job that they dream of, i am filled with envy. yes, this is the path i chose and i'm not regretting it. the experience i earned with working for this ""misunderstood"" industry is something i'll always treasure. but i BADLY want a change of environment. but what's stopping me is the fact i won't get the same amount of money if i choose a different path. if i want to, i can work for a law firm, be a researcher in the Foreign Service Institute or be a law student financed by my parents, but aside from the fact that i don't want to burden my parents with another four years of studying, i will lose the opportunity to get the same amount of money i earn right now. i also have the option to work here and study at the same time, but i don't want that. if i'll study law, i want to focus my attention to it or if ever i'll work, i'd work to an industry related to law.

my family's not exactly well-off and sometimes i wish i belong to one. (but of course i change my mind afterwards. amidst all their eccentricities, i love my family to bits.) so i guess, all i can do right now is to feel jealous because other people are on their way to pursue their dreams, while here i am, not even a step closer to what i want to be. but i swear, when i finally get there, i'm gonna make up for the lost time. but for the meantime, i guess i just have to bear with where i am and look at the silver lining.

I was able to recover, so here I am, half awake due to being full (hehehe).

I just realized that I'm getting chubbier each day. My favorite pair of pants is 100% tighter now and my spandex blouses exacerbate my jiggly stomach.

It's really hard to be on a diet while working. I need the energy to work, I'm not a big fan of vitamins and other forms of supplements so I rely on food. I started eating rice again to gain energy and i guess it's making things worse.

so i guess it's really time to enroll in a gym again.

i know my body and i know how to lose weight. i did that before right and i gained very satisfactory results. and the formula? gym + diet.

problem is, i don't know if I can manage to do that with my work schedule. sleep is vital to my kind of work and going to the gym means adding at least 2 hours to my ""awake"" time. oh well, what's a little sacrifice to gaining my bootylicious body back (as if! hehehe!)

it's time to prove to people that although i'm not physically attractive, i'm not someone worthy to be belittled, that i can reach things if i want to. i just hate it when people look down on me just because i am not pretty. but i guess i have to fight them heads on.

I mean, I am not like other people who envision themselves working for hotshot companies, having their own cubicles and working their ass off for their next presentation. i want to be a lawyer, so i see my future in a different perspective.

in a recent job interview for a higher position that i'm applying for, i told my boss that ""i want to experience dealing with people of authority in the corporate world."" in my mind i laughed at myself.no, what i said was true. i really wanted to experience mingling with the bosses even if it meant that i'm gonna be stuck in my own cubicle staying in the wee hours of night in the office finishing a report. no, i haven't sold out (hell, i consider being in the call center industry as selling out) and i still want to be a lawyer. i guess i just want a change of environment.

the job that i applied for is an administrative assistant. i will report to our senior operations manager. (yeah, my <u>former</u> crush. sobrang nagsawa na ko sa mukha nya eh. hehe). and the nature of the job is to be a secretary with a twist (analysis in reports, etc.) i quickly applied for the job because i guess i'm kinda tired of being treated like sh*t by customers who don't know how hard it is to do our job. i don't want to be an anger absorber anymore. i want something w/c is related to what i used to do in college - CRAMMING, submitting paperwork, analyzing reports, etc. and yeah, i wanna deal with the blue hats and the executives.

I tried to apply for a higher position here in the company, but I didn't pass. I was lucky enough to be shortlisted as an eligible applicant, but I guess the job isn't for me. SO right now I'm stucked to taking in (irate) calls. Silver lining? I get to stay with my team. =)

I bought a PS2 from my TL, and I guess it was worth buying. Why? Well, because of the ""savior"" console, my brother and i are ""buddies"" right now (I'm not kidding!). He hangs out in my room, we help each other in surviving RPGs, etc. My mom noticed that as well, and she said that she doesn't mind paying for a high electric bill as long as her children have a ""harmonious"" relationship...

I met this cute barista in the Starbucks branch downstairs. I think his name is Carlo. He's nice, not your usual papansin barista (although he is smiling his heart out). And funny thing is, he was attempting to have a conversation with me. I was surprised when he asked me ""any plans for the weekend?"". (Flirt mode wasn't on at that time, I was having a shitty day). I told him the truth.. ""I have to work eh."" And then when I went back to buy lollipop for my ever-kulit supervisor Dexter, he can still remember my name, at may small talk pa rin! Well, I saw him yesterday and he wasn't in duty, but I found him less attractive (I don't know if he still remembers me, ah ewan!)

I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. Shaking  off  my feelings for <b>him</b> off is something which is long overdue, and yet I can't seem to do it.

so i went downstairs... and the next thing i know i was gushing over this new uber cute barista (xempre i know the baristas there so i know that he's new). and he's the giddy type kasi the moment i entered he was smiling (like there's no tomorrow... ewan para ngang abnoy eh hehehe). tapos after i finished ordering, he suddenly asked me ""any plans for the weekend""... of course, i can't lie, so i had to say ""nah, i have work."" and then he replied, ""may work ka ng saturday? sipag ha!""

i just received my first-ever copy of my ITR.. and i felt like a true grown-up! well, i know that paying taxes is not a reason to celebrate, but i just felt like i'm a professional now. and the fact that i'm gonna reach my first anniversary @ cvg is contributing to this feeling.

<center>****</center>

i can't think of anything to rant/rave about, but i just realized one thing - patience is a virtue! i just looked @ a friend's career profile and i just realized that I CAN ALSO BE LIKE HER! i'm a fighter so i'd try my best to prove that i'm worth promoting!

... and this ends my senseless post... wuuh! exhausted!"

"event","and a lot of things happened to me... so where do i begin? hmmm... okay i know now.

work is keeping me uber occupied right now (and it's consuming what's left of my health). i'm still adjusting to my new shift (5-2 pm). my sleeping disorder is haunting me again, causing my absenteeism rate to increase (2 sls and one half day in barely a week after the month of march began...) i just hope i can adjust to this new shift, because i'm gonna go back to the gym na. 

i just learned from tatang richard today that i got a 5 in my score card... as in i was really surprised! but next month, i know that things are gonna be different due to my absenteeism rate.

so many people are resigning nowadays. some to search for greener pasture, others because of their grudge with our management and some due to memos and other bad working habits. as for me, i know that i am not going anywhere right now. not that i love my job, it's just that my plans for my ""real"" career won't start until a year or two passes. i'm not ready to study law yet. i've decided to earn and buy personal needs first before i go back to school (in other words, things for my independence - kitchenware, living room stuff, my own place, etc.) due to the erratic shift schedules that we're experiencing nowadays, i'm thinking of moving to our commonwealth site. but i'm not yet sure. 

just bought a new tv last week. it's a samsung 21"" flat tv. well, technically, i didn't buy it because i just added P1,500 for me to have it (automatic centre doesnt have a stock of the lg refridgerator that i won in the company raffle). and this inspired me to buy more things for my ""independence"".

my mom and i had i huge fight last monday... imagine, SHE MAXED-OUT MY CREDIT CARD?!?!?! I mean, I know that she's gonna pay for it, but what I'm mad about is because she never told me about the remaining balance until i asked... and she didn't tell me that she adjusted her credit limit as a supplementary holder! I just told her that what she did was too much, then she went beserk and scolded me, remided me of the things that she did for me when i was young, which is so out of the question. I mean, just because of that she told me na ""wala akong utang na loob?"" so right now i'm considered as persona non-grata in our house... good thing i have my own tv now (or else i'd miss on all my fave tv shows)

and i looove kim sam soon! (and cyrus is so cute!) shit nakakarelate ako!

i'm kinda tired now, so i'll just update this next week (promise!)"

"event","it's been a long time since i last posted... well i have been pretty busy. i swear i had been planning to update sooner but it seems that writer's block stopped me (plus the fact that we were bombarded by calls these past few weeks.)

things at work seem to be just fine, got a 4 in my score card (which i didn't expect because of my 2 sls.) another nice surprise is that i have the highest q4 bonus i the team... haller, 3,4,3 kaya ang scorecards ko for q4? while i know some people who have straight 4s in their scorecards but my bonus is higher than theirs. (me not complaining *grins*)

in a week's time, my shift will begin at 5 am (sad). but i guess this is a sign for me to go back to the gym na... my guy buddies at work are teasing me like hell due to my beer belly. at least may time na ko to go to the gym nang maaga pa. (looks forward to wearing a swimsuit again in the beach)

and speaking of outing, team warriors went to laguna last week. UBER FUN! booze galore, some mission impossible situations (like sneaking to the other vacant place to replace the microphone that ren broke... dex idol talaga kita!) and bonding moments. after that weekend, everyone became closer. i bet tl jing will be so proud of us, cuz we were commended as the team w/ team work. eh totoo naman kasi. yes, we're loud and boisterous, but we help each other with regard to stats. bawal ang selfish sa warriors!

citibank frustrates me these days... my card hasn't been delivered yet... and couriers are big liars... as in! they made the most stupid excuses. i told them that if they don't deliver the card within this week, i'm gonna cancel it. (nyak! irate customer ba!)

valentines day is here again *sigh*. it reminds me that i have been single for a long time. well, i saw <b>him</b> kanina and i'm so proud of myself, kasi what popped into my mind is that ""hindi talaga kami pwede"" instead of the usual ""i miss him badly"". of course i also had my share of senti moments (so sick of ne-yo brings that mood) but i must say that I HAVE MOVED ON.

my doctor and i are so close right now... too bad we couldn't move it to the next level. i know how attached he is to his loved one and i guess i just have to enjoy the friendship. he brought me back to life and that itself is priceless.

the best things that happened to me this year are:

1. being accepted at convergys
2. meeting new friends
3. having new love interests (hehehe)
4. being able to buy 10 pairs of shoes in 8 months (hahaha)
5. FINALLY being able to go to baguio

the worst things that happened to me this year are:

1. being not YET over him
2. acad issues
3. birthday war

so the good outweighs the bad, right? (dream on!)

but i'm kinda depressed these days... because it seems that my doctor and i are gonna part ways soon. no, we still are in good terms, but my doctor has to attend to other patients, and somewhat his medication is quite working. i just hope that i can finally recuperate from this love sickness. but if I do, I'm gonna miss him. :)

back to work for me, and i'm looking forward to 2006"

In fact, you're often a little short with people who don't impress you mentally.

You seem distant to some - but it's usually because you're deep in thought.
Those who understand you best are fellow Rationals.

In love, you tend to approach things with logic. You seek a compatible mate - who is also very intelligent.

well, not that work is too dragging. in fact, i'm having a blast at work. i have team mates who are absolutely fun to be with and if there's anything that i miss in the 31st floor of enterprise center tower 1, that would be them!

anyway, i'm gonna stop talking about work now.. coz i have a life after all. honestly, i'm not really feeling that well when i woke up. i'm suffering from coughs and colds, but i dragged myself out of bed so that i could go out. so here i am! 

<lj-cut text=""copied from my ever-reliable xda II"">

<b>MY DOCTOR LOVE</b>

I met my doctor more than a month ago. The first time his eyes met mine, I knew he was special. And turns out that I was right.

For someone as lovesick as I am, I consider finding him as a panacea. He never fails to put a smile on my face. His warmth soothes the freezing feeling of solitude. And most of all, he gave the light of hope in this dark alley of loneliness I'm walking unto.

As my doctor, he helps me with this process of healing my broken heart. he guides me through recuperation. After all, three years of being head-over-heels in love withe <b>him</b> is almost terminal.

But as the doctor, he isn't necessarily the solution to my problem. He is just there to help my weary heart to be healthy again. Whether or not I will recover depends upon me. I know that my doctor won't always be around because he has a life to live and a girl waiting for him.

I don't consider myself in love with him yet but i hope that if I do, i won't fall that much. I couldn't bear the thought of another heart break, beacsue I know that my doctor will never fall for a patient like me and I don't want to abuse his kindness as well. I just hope that my doctor can help me get through the pain I've been lingering for the past three years. helping me heal this broken heart of mine will be the best thing he can ever do for me, whether this friendship of ours goes to the next level or not. </lj-cut>

that's all for now. will post again when i'm back at work... =)"

i turned 21 yesterday. and i honestly feel that it's my worst birthday to date. why? on top of arguing with my mom yesterday, i also wasnt able to see <b>him</b> or be with <b>him</b>. i was crying on the phone while we were talking and all <b>he</b> said was <i>""wag mo nang isipin yun, nataon lang na birthday mo... magcelebrate ka na lang bukas..."" </i> wow... some advice. but i miss <b>him</b>.

then i realized that there would never be an <b>us</b> again. why? a lot of factors... the biggest factor is that <b>he</b> seems to be living in a different world right now. he works like hell and doesn't have time for any ""miscellaneous"" activity. oh well... so much for holding on...

but i do have a new crush (i can hear someone snigger... hahaha). i call him doctor love. (i hope he can heal my heart sickness... yuck ang baduy!) well, he's nice, friendly and talented. we get along quite well actually. we met last month and ever since that i can't seem to get enough of him. oh well... =)

so how was being 20 for me? my life changed ever since i stepped out of school. i worked, earned my own money, met new people. being 20 isn't that bad, although people expected me to go to law school immediately.

i just hope that my life(and my love life) will be better this year... aaawww..."

we just had a huge fight. and this is the biggest fight that we had in years. reason? a simple text message. (slaps forehead in frustration.)

don't get us wrong. we're not mababaw. it's just that this one simple irritation lead to a storm of issues w/c came out eventually. and when we tried to fix everything, it just got worse. blame it on our temper (or <b>his</b> temper. i've never seen <b>him</b> that angry in my whole life).

now i'm trying my very best not to talk to <b>him</b>. i believe that space will do us good. we're not even officially committed so i guess that's okay (not... )

"event","well this weekend was great. my sister started learning how to snowboard. i had a great time meeting a lot of new kids. and the runs were pretty awesome up at smugglers notch. i went down this closed trail at the end of the day saturday. it was amazing, the best run i have ever been on. a foot and a half of untouched powder. wide flowing turns, snow flying 10 feet in the air with each one. spectacular. but here's the catch. a ski patrol guy saw me go down, and cut me off at the bottom. he clipped my ticket for the day. but told me that i could go to the ski patrol place and see if i would get it back. so after he said that i was happy again. the rest of the run was just as amazing, so it was totally worth it. and i got a lift ticket for the next day anyways.

as much as a enjoyed the weekend half of me didnt want to be there. this whole thing sucks...
it wasn't supposed to be anything but i wanted it to be more. i miss court, miss her smile, just being with eachother, i knew i would. but she lives 4 hours away most the year...
even if this isn't one sided like i think it is, i wouldnt want to put her through trying to make something work when we never got to see eachother.  i don't know, just what's been on my mind. friends with benefits never works, if that's even what it was, i don't know, i didnt want to say anything for the fear of her not wanting to spend time with me before she left.
im just rambling"

i am planning a trip to the pennhurst insane asylum in 3 weeks with a few people. im pretty excited it sounds real cool. we are going to scare ourselves shitless. 

i was talking with tussey and i think we are going to drive up to CT for death threat's last show on the 29th. they are playing with 100 demons, madball, and death before dishonor. i'm pretty stoked, i have 3 more seats in the car if people are interested.

"event","well yesterday was fun, courtney and i were going to go snowboarding but it was all rainy so we just went to shady maple. unfortunately we were too late for breakfast and it kind of sucked. afterwards we went to see a series of unfortunate events. i liked it a lot, jim carrey was pretty funny. she's a lot of fun, doesn't really matter what we do we always have a good time together. after hanging with court i went hoem for awhile and ended up going to see meet the fockers with andrew herren, abby, molly, john walter, and kimbo. i know, 2 movies in 1 day....sad. but regardless it was absolutely hysterical. much better than the first on in my opinion. we went back to andrew's house and sarah and nicole were watching the O.C. on dvd....kill me. played some dice and pool, was good times. 

today i might go to church. it's horrible that i might not go to church on christmas eve but my aunt and uncle are moving away and we always go to their house for dinner. so maybe i will call and see if it ok if i show up late. we'll see. after that i am heading to a party around 9, it's cool getting to see all the people that i don't see more than once or twice a year. all the kids i looked up to when i was little. it's hard to believe it is christmas eve already. it doesn't feel like it at all, especially with the weather. i'm not really excited for it anymore. 

I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas."

"event","dare i say was amazing saturday, i video taped most of their set. the show was a lot of fun, ajdelaware's band played and i was very impressed, i wasn't expecting it. your worst nightmare ended up playing, i love getting to see them but you couldn't hear kaelin very well, i think they had a problem with the amps. and far out played a song with dean filling in for rob on bass. sometime in april sounded pretty good as well. if anyone wants to see the video let me know, i think ross wants to take all the videos and edit them. they'll be missed.

we went to the exton diner afterwards with like 25 people. it was a good time, we headed to people's light and everyone got drunk, anytime little mark gets drunk and there are costumes around it's a good time. i got home around 5.

well yesterday was pretty cool, watched the eagles game at justin's house with tony, abby, meghan, her sister, and jon. was a pretty good game, the rest of the season should be fairly easy. it's pretty awesome that the eagles have already clinched the division.

youth group was a good time, i had arby's for dinner and then went to sleep before everyone got there. the service was really good, they played some of my favorite songs. in addition, wayne presbyterian church visited and i got to spend some time with them afterwards. met some really nice people, hopefully i will see them again soon.

"event","well things have kinda sucked lately. One of my mom's best friend's, Michelle, has cancer. I don't think I have ever seen her so sad. I have had tons of homework, got caught last week skipping english and i had an internal yesterday. I'm just sucking at school big time. Im doing my best to turn that all around though. Next week is going to be awesome though. It's spirit week, I think i will probably go to the homecoming game. Wednesday is Converge which will be amazing, Sunday is Dying Fetus but i don't think I'm going because Monday night is Dillinger, ETID, and Zao. Then we have tuesday off for election day. I'm doing my best to get caught up with all the school stuff but im doing very well and don't expect my report card to look very good. 

Im leaving for Peppermill soon to meet with all the young life kids. peace"

"event","this entry is for cal because he has nothing better to do at work than read this stuff. the last week has been mind blowing. this is the entire story from beginning to end:
     As many of you may know, I took a trip to Honduras in August with my church. We went to La Entrada to build latrines, beds, and tables for many of the local families along with spending time in a school with all the kids from the area. When we were at one of the sites that was getting a latrine, I saw one of the most shocking things I have seen in my life. After all the poverty I had seen, people with 1 set of clothes, no water, starving to death in 1 room adobe huts with 6 kids sleeping on the floor; I didn't think i could see anything else that would suprise me. We were standing outside this house planning how we would install the latrine and someone pointed out that there were small person-like molding out of dog feces. These kids had no toys, they were poor to the point that they found entertainment in playing with their dog's refuse. 
     So the story continues, I was talking to my mom when I came home. She didn't understand how poor these kid's truly were. And I told her this story. She has now made herself a goal, she asked me tonight how many kids I thought were in this entire town. I told her 20,000 as an uneducated guess. She plans to send 20,000 toys down to these kids, these starving kids with nothing. A week ago she spoke with Ken Ballinger about sending down toys, he said there would be room in the next shipment my church sends down for 200 or so. He didn't think she would be able to get that many in a few weeks time. After a week, she has been coming home with bags upon bags full. We have somewhere between 500 and 1000 at the moment. The goal isn't realistic, but anythign is possible. She is going to do this or die trying. I can't begin to explain the overwhelming respect I have for my mother. I am so impressed, so amazed that she is struggling between keeping our household together and running a business and she finds the time to do something like this. She is coming next year, my sister and father don't know, and probably won't until a few weeks before we go, but she is coming. She is going to see the faces that she has worked so hard to bring a smile to. I can't wait, this is going to be an amazing trip. If anyone has extra toys, stuffed animals, frisbees, balls, dolls, anythign that would be appropriate for kids to play with in a CHRISTIAN culture (aka no army men or guns) please let me know, or bring them to my house or give them to me in any way you see fit. Everything helps.

"event","well i went to the A Life Once Lost, the red chord, and evergreen terrace last night with grayson. it was amazing, A TEAM nights are always fun. also met up with Matt Murphy and Brendan Casey, which was awesome. Some chick hit him in the back of the head while he was dancing, but he didn't realize it was a chick so he threw his arm back and hit her in the face. he ended uo getting thrown out but they let him back in after her explained himself. then during the red chord the girls crew attacked him in the corner. it was pretty fucked up, i didnt even know it was him until after it happened or i would have been in that. he ended up with a black eye. lauryn was there, awesome, i havent seen her in forever but hopefully we will be able to chill more when i get my license. 

after the show i met this homeless guy and ended up buying him a hoagie at wawa. he said he was a nam vet and was dieing from agent orange. crazy stuff, he was showing me all his battle wounds. bought his buddy a hot dog too, then i forgot to get myself something, lol. we went to this party afterwards with grayson's sister, sam. it was pretty lame, all these college kids, some guy was like oh and here come the ""kids."" i wanted to curb stop that kid. all these nasty art school chicks with hairy arm pits and crap, it was gross. got home around 2.

im going out to dinner with my aunt and uncle and cousin, lisa. she is up for the weekend from florida, i haven't seen her since christmas. apparently she is living with these guy in a boat and he puts the anchor out the the harbor and she has to row back to shore to go to work. i don't know what happened with her, she's so smart and nice and beautiful but it doesn't she like she is going anywhere in life. whatever, i hope that all works out. her boyfriend is going to be there tonight too, he better be a nice guy.

"event","hey everyone, i got back from Honduras about this time last night. it was an amazing trip, i think everyone needs to see the things i saw, it really puts your life in perspective. makes you realize how lucky you are and how worthless our worries and concerns are when millions of people around the world are worried about getting food for their kids and worried about their house falling apart in a storm. think about it, this trip helped affirm my calling to ministry, i have the overwhelming feeling that i have been put here to serve. that i need to leave my material desires behind and help people. i know what i want to do and nothing is going to stop me. ill post pictures when i get them developed.

the people i met had nothing, they lived in 1 room tin huts. sometimes sleeping on the floor with as many as 11 kids. and they were so concerned with putting others first. these people would share everything they had. they went out of their way to help us. i can't explain it in words, this was a life changing experience and i made friends that i will keep in touch with for a long time. 

i saw God in the most unlikely people on this trip. will's father, Butch, had kids on his lap, he hugged them and held them and loved them like they were his own. 

i left to help the people of La Entrada and they did more for me than i could do for them with a million dollars. they helped me find my calling, find what i want to do the rest of my life. and i thank them for that."

"event","lately im just kind of confused and frustrated. it seems like every time i meet a girl that's awesome they live like 30 or 40 minutes away. and i don't even know what to do anymore, i need to be with someone. i had forgotten how difficult it is to get a girlfriend, someone that i can relate to on more than one level. i have just been in such a blah mood.

i went down to the saves the day show last night but it was sold out. and then i tried to buy  a scalped ticket and got ripped off 40 bucks. then i walked 18 blocks and dan park picked me up and took me to meet jeff in upper darby. thankfully everything worked out but it sucked, just an overall shitty night. but major thanks to dan and jeff for helpin me out.

ahhhhhhhhhhh....tonight was alright but it seems like i just started on another path that is destined to fail. i just dont know what the fuck to do anymore"

"event","well it turns out my parents did find out about the party. i had forgotten to check their bed and i think either Coleen or Bill Feely's bowl fell out of their pocket. my dad laid down on it, and it was packed lol. i think the whole thign is hysterical. i have no regrets, that night was awesome. although i probably shouldn't have told them that. i dont think im even going to get in much trouble, i just had to clean some stuff and wash the car and they havent told me anything else. i have been trying to convince them to sell the bowl though lol. 

i might hang out with morgan tonight if im allowed, she got her liscense though so  that'd be awesome. she's crazy, i think she might be goin out with ted beidler now but we'll see, i didnt talk to her about it."

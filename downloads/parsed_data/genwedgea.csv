"event","Forever Knight!! That's the TV show I've been trying to think of!  Anybody else watch this?  It was on the Sci-Fi channel years ago, about the vampire who was a cop, trying to do finally do some good in his life.  I used to watch it all the time, along with Farscape, Highlander, MacGuyver, etc and another one I can't remember the name of....it had a female lead character who was special somehow (and no, not Alex Mack, even though I used to watch that all the time, too).  There was this place she was being experimented on (The Agency? something like that) that she was always running away from....damn it.  It was a really good show, too.  If anyone has any idea what the hell I'm talking about, let me know....haha.  Hahaha and Lexx used to be on Friday nights, too.  That show was completely and utterly bizarre, but I don't remember enough about it to remember why exactly.  Ahh, good television....haha.  Like 24.  Damn that was a good episode.  Sucks that I won't be able to watch the rest of the season, unless Doug feels ambitious and compresses, burns, and mails me dvd's full of the rest of the season.  Which would be awesome.  And I'd be eternally grateful.  Nudge nudge, wink wink.  Doug, by the way, are you even paying attention?  Aww, fuck it.  Oh, and Puddle Cruiser, the first movie that Broken Lizard made, is terrible.  Effing terrible.  Oh sure, it's funny in parts, mostly because Broken Lizard knows a good joke when they see one, but they have gotten INFINITELY better at delivering lines.  So yeah.  Time to get back to work, I guess."

"event","Have you ever wanted to live the life you see on TV?  I mean, what guy hasn't wanted to be Van Wilder?  Or Jack Bauer for that matter?  And what girl hasn't wanted to be....oh, I don't know, Carrie Bradshaw or Holly Golightly? (I'm just guessing here, I really have no idea who women would want to be - I'd like to know, though, so if any females read this, leave a comment of who you'd want to be).  But anyways, you realize that life isn't like the movies, that life isn't this perfectly planned bit of comedy, or action or drama (well, sometimes there's drama or action, but it's never the it'll all work out in the end, everyone goes home happy except for the bad guy who somehow happens to get what's coming to him kind.  Life is real, and maybe it's because we fantasize about what life could be that it isn't perfect.  Anyway, enough late night rambling, it's time for bed."

"event","What another awesome weekend at Clarkson, full of drinking, drifting, and slamming heads into the ceiling.  Haha and we have videos of all three of them, especially of the drifting (which was awesome) and Jimbo hitting the ceiling (which was fucking hilarious).  Went up Friday and me, the retard, missed the exit to get off of 81 and onto 342/11 and wound up in Alexandria Bay.  So I stop at a pizza place to see if there's a shorter way to get back to Potsdam, and the guys just laugh at me.  Fucking A.  So anyway, I finally get there, play kings and pong for awhile, and then pass out.  Awesomely fun, as always, but the real fun was Saturday night, when Jimbo and Rob pretty much downed an entire bottle of SoCo on their own - I don't think Jim's liver will ever forgive him.  I didn't know it was humanly possible to expunge that much material from one's stomach, but holy hell it didn't stop - he was also still extremely drunk in between passing out and throwing up, so when I was watching Top Gun later on, Jimbo would randomly wake up and start mumbling the lines and then pass out again.  Rob, meanwhile, is doing his damnedest to not throw up, and succeeds (while going on an absolutely fucking hilarious rant while in the bathroom of what exactly is happening inside his body.....you had to be there, and you probably had to have been intoxicated.  The weekend, in a word - hawsum.  



Oh, and for those of you that don't know, I won't be at UB this semester, I'll be studying abroad in France (Toulouse, it's in southwestern France, near Spain, a long way away from Paris).  And the best part is that I get to take engineering classes!  Alright, that's not the best part, in fact it kinda sucks, but whatever.  And no, I still don't know much French.  Oh, and the Olympics are in Torino! which is like 11? hours away by train, which kicks ass.  The prices to see actual events are ridiculous, but even just going there should be a blast - from what I hear, it's one hell of a party the whole time.  And who knows, maybe I'd even get to party with Bode!  We all know he likes his parties, and there are plenty of races to get wasted before.  Ohhh, Bode - you are my hero, and have been since you started kicking so much Austrian ass.  Speaking of skiing, I absolutely plan on skiing in the Alps (or the Pyrenees, whatever, I'm not picky....haha), even more so because this winter has sucked so badly (no snow on the ground, it's 50's and raining?  What the hell is this?).  Come to think of it, we haven't had a decent winter since I left High School....we haven't shown our downstate friends a good snowstorm yet.  I mean, come on! It's not like I'm asking for a blizzard, just enough snow to build a ramp off the back of the garage.  You know, the good old days.  When we used to do stupid shit on a regular basis that usually ended up in us getting hurt somehow.  



But back to France - as much as I'm excited to go (and believe me, I can't wait), I'm also nervous.  And slightly regretful - I don't want to get all sappy and shit, but I'm lucky enough to have some great friends that I'd rather not part with, even if only for a few months.  And if this semester would have been anything like last semester, it would have been amazingly fun.  There's always next year, i guess (but not for too long - holy shit college is going by way too fast!).  But, it's a chance I'm probably not going to get again any time soon, so I'm not going to miss out on it.  Aaaand, I still don't know French.  But I'll survive - I'm likable, aren't I?  Maybe?  Anyway, it should be a blast.

"event","This week has without a doubt been the worst of my academic career.  I have never put so much time and effort into studying for exams to be left feeling completely helpless when I actually take them.  And the thing that really pisses me off is that I had an A going into most of these finals, and now I'm just hoping to pass. 



On a better note, Materials was not impossible.  It was damn hard, but not impossible, and that's fine by me.  One more to go, and then the semester will be over......


Alright, enough self-pity, time to go study some more while I pull the second all-nighter in four days.  Oh, just as a sidenote, I found this funny: the bottle of liquid caffeine that I picked up at Wegman's (Monster Energy or some shit like that) came with the following warning:

Consume resposibly - Limit 3 cans per day.  Not recommended for children, pregnant women, or people sensitive to caffeine."

311 - A
334 - C
376 - A
381 - A
335 - B
World Civ -  A-

Which would lead to me getting 3.445, raising me to a 3.233 overall.  Not bad!  If I can raise Scott's class above a C (which is gonna be tough, but possible) to a B-, it's a 3.557, and a B would put me at 3.612 and 3.263 overall, which would mean I'd be on Dean's List for the first time ever!  Of course, with finals still to go in all of those, all A range is....possible? Not sure, but i hope so.  Anyway, this semester is going a lot better than i thought it was, which is good.

one hell of an awesome time - went to Clarkson with Brianna, Laura and
Mike to visit Rob and his friends. Some of the pictures, if anyone cares to see
them (and you should, because they are awesome), are in <a href=""http://photobucket.com/albums/a180/knee_scraper/group%20visit%2010x21/"">Rob's photbucket</a>.&nbsp;
What an awesome weekend - getting Mike absolutely smashed, both nights
(getting an early start on college, while not puking either night!),
girls making out on the car ride up and then for the trucker on the way
back (i think his day was made after seeing that), and while playing
spin the bottle for the first time ever, rock climbing on some very
loose rocks (and then taking pictures next to the awesome waterfall and
saving Rob's life along with Mike....twice....as he ran from the camera
he had put on a timer back to the group), pregaming for the hockey game
we decided not to go to which included playing Kings and pong way too
early in the night (we started drinking at like 5) and then getting up
to 100 on the thruway in Brianna's car on the way back while she was
asleep.&nbsp; Ahh, why can't there be more days in the weekend?&nbsp;
That would be splendid.<br>
<br>
So now I'm back at UB, and guess who just rocked a 93 on an engineering
exam? ME!&nbsp; That hasn't happened since.....fucking high
school.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll get an A in that class, so i can balance
out the C i'll get in Fluids and in Scott's class.....<br>
<br>
Thanks to Brianna for the ride, and everyone else for an amazing time, we need to do it again sometime soon...<br>"

Anyone ever get the feeling that you could do something great, something that people would read about in history books, if only you could figure out what that was?  I mean, I'm not one to believe in fate, so I'm wondering if the people we read about decided they were going to do something great (and by great I don't necessarily mean good), or did they just do it?  Sometimes I think I could do something great....it's just getting there that's the problem.  

Also, to my professors - stop sucking ass and actually listen to your students.  If the students in your previous classes told you they wanted more examples, THEN GIVE US MORE EXAMPLES!!  Don't stand there and say that if we ask for more examples, you'll give them to us - you were already told, apparently by a great many people.  And for some reason I can't really wrap my brain around just now, you insist on using the same shitty ass book year in and year out, even though the majority of the students TOLD you the book sucked ass.  And while I know this is impossible, at least in the Engineering department, once, just once, I'd like to learn something relevant to the homework/exams (heaven forbid we actually learn something useful!) in class.  I thought professors were supposed to get better as the courses got harder?

Well, back to the adventures of Achilleus and the gods.  You know, if I weren't genuinely interested in the material, this class would be boring as hell."

"event","Hurray for Discovery landing safely!  It's great to see the shuttles flying again, but I can't help but think that all the money they'll be pouring into redesigning the external tank *again* would be better put to use creating a newer spacecraft?  Or even setting aside a measly $10 million of the budget to start a new X-Prize competition, with the caveat that the winning craft be able to transport cargo into space.  I do think, though, that space travel, venturing out into the unknown, is of the utmost importance.  Of course there will always be those people that is a waste of time and resources, and that the money would be better spent on the poor countries in Africa, etc.  But to this, I say that not only has space exploration given rise to numerous technological and biological advances (with many more to come, I'm sure, once the Space Station is expanded) which will cure many of the ailments we face today, but have we not learned the lesson that throwing money at a problem *never* solves it?  That unless you get to the crux of the problem, figure out how it got there and how to fix it, the problem will only continue to get worse?  Oh, and let us not forget that war, famine, poverty, and general ill will have been around for a looong time, and I just don't see them going away anytime soon, no matter how hard we try (except maybe famine....extremely difficult, but possible - the others will always plague us).  

Oh, one other thing - I think that it will be private corporations, and not NASA, ESA, China or Russia that will take us to the stars, and I intend to be there.  One way or the other.  Hell, if I have my way, it'll be my corporation leading the way for millions to travel into space."

I'm glad I took the internship at Hadley this summer, since it gave me some valuable insight into the career I wish to follow.....and that career doesn't involve doing CAD every damn day. It pays very well, but it is so boring.  3D modeling, on the other hand, is fun, and i enjoy it.  Designing seems to be where's it at, though, at least for now.  I just want something that pays relatively well, where there isn't a ton of personal interaction, and that I can enjoy doing.  That's not asking too much, is it?

I still have to find out more about this semester in France, but I definitely want to go - it looks like it'll be soo much fun.  And the Olypmics are in Torino!! I can see Bode tear shit up on the biggest mountains I've ever seen - fucking awesome, I know. And then I can travel all around Europe during the weekends and breaks, spending all of the money I've earned this summer.  Eh, it'll totally be worth it.  And I can't wait for school to start, but not until we take a road trip somewhere...."

"event","So I was watching ""Crossing Jordan"" tonight, and it was about a guy who was going around killing people. The problem was that he was killing child molesters.  Apparently his child was one of the children who was abducted, and he became a vigilante father out for blood. Noble concept, but it got me thinking, if I were the cop in the show, what is the right thing to do? I mean, he is cleaning the streets of possibly the worst people on the planet.  But he is also committing a crime himself.  I guess if you believe in justice, you have to catch the killer, but for me, there would be a moral issue.  Same with ""The Boondock Saints"" (awesome movie, by the way; see it if you haven't already), people killing other killers and assorted bad men.  But who's to say they are right?  I don't know, I think you have to draw the line somewhere, though.  I believe there are different types of justice, and your view depends upon which version of justice you place highest on the list...justice of the law, moral justice, poetic justice...now I'm just rambling...haha

So now I'm sitting here, watching a movie, and missing the one I love the most...on the bright side, there's only a week left until school starts again!! I am definitely ready to kick some ass this semester.  I also need to find a job....shit.  One that gives me a lot of money.  Anboddy have any suggestions for internships for the summer?  I think it'd be awesome to intern at the Jet Propulsion Lab in California, even if it'd be bitch work.  Hell, I'd do any work there.  Or any NASA place for that matter.  What if they saw me and wanted me to be an astronaut?? Now THAT would be fucking awesome.  Even though it would never happen, because of my goddamn vision.  But if it did? Holy shit.  Or if they just hired me and decided to pay me a lot of money, and I could just not finish school.  Or a test pilot!!!  Booyah.  I would totally do that. In a heartbeat.  My fingers are crossed.  Whatever I end up doing, I hope I'm having fun.

So, yeah.  The past couple weeks have been extremely stressful, almost to the breaking point, but I made it through the first wave battered but no worse for the wear.  Alright.  Deep breaths now.  Haha just don't look that far forward, or you'll see the next batch coming.  And no one wants that, now do they?  I might even have time to be online now!  That would be cool.

But I think out of all of this thinking and all of this stressfull worrying, I came to realize one very important fact, and that is that I will never truly find myself, I will never find a set of rules that govern me and that's that.  I doubt I will ever know exactly what to do in a given situation, but hell, that's part of the experience.  And feeling is all that matters, right?  I mean, in the end, only one thing really matters, and it's not hard to find it.

Today was probably the happiest I've been since I wasn't in this county, and I don't really know why.  Probably a couple of things.  I think I realize things better when people don't try and make me realize it, unless I make a selfconscious effort. 

Oh, and I watched a show on the Discovery Channel (which has some of the coolest shows on television) about a Trans-Atlantic tunnel.  Amazingly cool. Engineers estimate that the total trip would take, oh.....less than an hour.  That means that the train would need to go at an average speed of about 4000 miles per hour.  In other words, Mach 6.  Booyah!  I'm thinking the acceleration could literally rip people out of their seats.  Now THAT would be a train ride.  Estimated cost for this endeavor? A measly $11 trillion dollars.  As in, much more than the total US production in a year.  It's said that it would require the steel output from every steel mill in the world, for over a year.  This is part of the whole idea to put a highway all across the world (which would require a bridge in the Bering Strait, and I don't know quite how that will work.....), which isn't a bad idea, it's just awesomely expensive. Ah well, here's the future.  (And as for the future, does anyone that reads this believe in the Singularity?  If so, I'd be interested in hearing if/when you think it will happen and why)."

Secondly, I had a dream last night that was so real I thought I was still in real life.  When the phone rang, it wasn't so much me waking up as it was my world be jarred away from me.  Which seems to be happening more and more often.  I remember it had something to do with Wombosi (the object of Bourne's failed assasination attempt) from ""The Bourne Identity"", an old mansion, and a lot of people....  This one was definitely not as cool or exciting as the one I had a few days ago, where I was an Animorph...now that one was just awesome.  The coolest morph had to be a falcon...flying around, up near the clouds...nothing beats that feeling of freedom.  Although, being a tiger felt damn cool too. I wish I could have the dream every night, because it was just amazing.  Too bad it wasn't real.....

Finally starting to get in shape!! Yay!  Hopefully I'll get cleared to do more tomorrow, that would be awesome.  I mean, it hurts a little, but not nearly enough to keep me from doing anything, all I need to know is if exercise will damage it any further...if not, awesome.  I tried swimming the other day, with mixed results.  Hurt a little bit, enough to keep me from swimming hard, but it felt so good to swim.  And to catch up with Lindsay, Amy, and the Mays.  Haven't talked to Lindsay in a looong time, and haven't seen Amy since ski season.  Mayyybe we can talk my dad into buying the cottage next door!!  That would be awesome, Silver Lake is a cool place.  Small lake, but big enough to do watersports.  Which is a must for any cottage.  I mean, come on.  Going to a cottage on a lake and not waterskiing (or motoboarding for that matter)?  What kind of heresy is that?  And plus, it would give him an excuse to buy a boat, and I know he wants one.  (Haha but then again, he's talking about buying an M Roadster....which would be AWESOME!! But, I know he probably won't.  I'm not going to talk him out of it, though)  And plus, it's close enough to make a day trip or even a few-hour trip to there, which means I'd probably be up there all the time.

I think it would be cool to do a triathlon in the fall, and that's probably a lot of wishful thinking, but it would be a good goal and I would feel like I've actually accomplished something, a feat not known to me very often.  Something to think about (and I'd still like to run a marathon, I'm just not motivated enough to actually train, so if anyone wants to run one with me, feel free to ask, because even if i didn't run it, I'll at least get into decent shape).

Last night was the Eric Clapton concert.  The Man has to be like 60 years old, and he is still the greatest blues guitarist alive.  It's amazing.  And it was an amazing show!! Haha everyone stood up and started shouting when they heard the intro to ""Layla""....such an amazing song.  Best solo of the night by far was in ""I Shot The Sheriff""....weird, I know, but it was amazing nonetheless.  I swear the crowd was as loud as when Clapton and crew were playing when he left the stage the first time.  They didn't even try to cover up the fact that he was coming back onstage, either.  They left some of the lights on, showing the roadies setting the instruments up.  And come on, no encore?  From the guitar god himself?  Haha he had already played ""Layla"", so I was happy.  But we got to hear ""Crossroads"", and that was awesome.  (Oh, and I had ""Let It Rain"" lyrics in my away message that night, and guess what the first song was?  Booyah. Great song.  And Steve Gadd on drums....never faltered once.  Everyone nailed their parts.  And plus there were drunken people dancing below is, the drunk chick molesting the railing because no one would dance with her, and the redneck....classic.

Flashes of brilliance behind the camera by Sam Raimi (some great camera shots...especially when Spidey confronts Doc Ock....), some surprising good acting for an action movie (let alone a comic book movie) from....well....everyone.  As well as awesome action scenes, 2 was loaded with scenes charged with emotion, scenes that actually moved me, something you don't find in most comic book movies (especially Peter dreaming about Uncle Ben....great scene).  I think my favorite scene just might be the subway, right before Doc Ock comes back....just so powerful.  As usual, Stan Lee makes his appearence, albeit for less than a second.  Guest appearence also by The Lizard, which not too many people caught (I sure didn't the first time, it was only after the movie that Mike reminded me who he was in human form).  More than a few references to ""Evil Dead"", now that I think of it, including the operation scene with Doc Ock, and the cameo by Bruce Campbell.  They are making six Spiderman movies....six!! Booyah!  I hope Venom is the villian for the third movie, now that would make for a kickass movie...although they don't come much better than Doc Ock, especially with Alfred Molina doing an absolutely perfect job portraying him."

So much fun.  And then Mary came!!! Which was just simply amazing.  That night was incredible, as was the rest of the weekend.  I love seeing that smile.....  But anyways, I left the lake with a busted shoulder that's feeling much better, and a hundred good memories.  Even though things were going downhill for awhile, it was still awesome fun.  Like always.  Only better.  Things seem to be going more or less the way that I want them to, which is a good thing. Not as good as they could be, but not nearly as bad as they could be, either.  And definitely more good than bad.  So, things are looking up for this summer.  Things with my parents could be going better (well, just with Mom.....), but all I want is to be able to talk to my mom without a lecture, which will never happen.  Even if I sit her down and tell her this, she'll go go into her ""everyone hates me, i'm never right, i should just quit"" routine.  Uggh.  I just wish that I could talk to her.

"event","OK well I just weighed myself.. I weigh 150 exactly (as usual).... I have I think 13.5 weeks until high school starts (or 96 days) . So, I want to lose 15 lbs by August 20, getting me down to 135. In theory I should be able to do it, but I know I am going to have to work VERY VERY VERY hard. Mom says I can join WW again, which I think will definately help. I also signed up for tennis lessons and two volleyball camps, followed by volleyball practice for the Freshman team at HS, which I will hopefully make. So, yeah. 
I am a bit confused about J. I mean, I really think that I have no chance with him... how he (or any other guy for that matter) could like me is totally above my head. I don't want to put my heart on the line right now, so I decided that I'm gonna try to move on. I explained it Hannah like this: "" It's not because I don't like him. It's because I like him SO much that I don't want to go on liking him in secret, torturing myself."" 
I really think that if he is to be mine, it will happen in God's time... whenever that is. I see us as soul mates, for some reason. But right now, I don't think it is the best time. I have self - esteem and eating issues and I don't need a guy right now to complicate matters. I plan on coming back to high school, and getting his attention right then and there... 8.20.03 . :) 
So, yeah, that's my life right now. Welcome to my world."

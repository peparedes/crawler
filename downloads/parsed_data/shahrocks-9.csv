"event","I have a very bad feelings about war. It is the most unreasonable thing in the world. For example like the World War 1 commenced from 1893-1905 and the World War 2 which commenced from 1934-1945.

  
  Everyone in the world wants to have peace and harmony. But not all people in the world wants that. The war of Iraq, which was commenced on 2002 and still going on. I think it is a bad habit to have war. I think war has to be stopped so that everyone in the world can have the peacefulness of the world."

The second thing I want to see is that to create a street soccer field in the school so that I and Melvin can play football after school to enjoy. Also, I also want a bigger volleyball court for the volleyball team to easier up their practice.

"event","The term was a nightmare for me. sometimes, its a dream. The nightmare begin in the Secondary One Camp. I was very very unsatisfied of mysekf after that incident. But then I've realized all the bad things that i had done for the past 7 years. But If I keep going on like this, something terrible is going on to me. The only thing I like about this year is my this terms results. Actually, I am only satisfied with only my Maths and Geography results as I have at least an A1 or an A2. I hope I can do well in my upcoming Mid year Examination in Term 2."

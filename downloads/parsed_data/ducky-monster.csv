The month of may...

was fucking crazy so much drama and sick of it. im dealing with it.... but was hoping it was going to get better i had a job.. that was good got the kittie nootered!! and family was happy maybe that was april i dont remember. but i was arrested with my grat pal tramain lol and it was funni cause me and him didnt do shit lol... it was fucked...
but i was scared ill admit that they fucking grabed us and slamed us to the ground they wouldn't believe it wasn't use .. and this whole thing with kayleigh was fucked shes like pressing charges on me for god knows.. like that night she basically hit me and shes ruining my life i cry'd for days it sucked.. like i hate her, i would like to have been friends with her but i dunno i guess it was to early.. but i hope shes good i hope shes happy and way better and feeling good wish i could have done that for her.. but oh well.. carlie is doing ok i watching her trying to make her happy so she dosen't die cause i would be deeply sad if i lost her i have known her for 3 going on 4 years thats alot!!&nbsp;



june...

fucked up i have a warrent out for my arrest cause i couldn't make it to court cause i was so stressed about this kayleigh thing i forgot.. i forgot i was even on probation.. theres nothing i can do but deal with my punishment..and and hope everyone will be here when i get back .. i mean i do wanna leave this state tho like i think i want to design homes and stuff that would be way cool and something i would like to do rather then be a doctor and do it just for the money.. me and my brother have been really close lately its kool i feel wanted in this family and ever since he moved out i was bummed and now hes back . maybe now ill be good .. sally is still the same but she likes females... dont know why.. but its cool she likes my friend carlies car is fucked so she has no car at all.. i think her parents are stupid for buying it in the first place for 1500.... its shitty on gas looks ugly.. its a piece.. but she likes it .. tramain. hes doing good hes happy he has some romance in his life with this girl from his school&nbsp; thats good im happy for him! he needs someone good.. hes a good guy well i guess these are all my ups but hey why think of the downs it put people in bad moods.. i need to be happy.."

i woke up, watched the dvd that came with my silverstein cd. played drums for about an hour, napped because i was sick still a little sleeping with kayleigh kinda made me feel better dunno what was up with me yesterday but i felt my life was fucking up a little i noticed im jobless again next week me and tramain are going job seaching.&nbsp;

thinking about how much this tatoo i want is going to cost...

then later that night i went to see kayleigh..

some weird reason i love her everyday even more how much she cares it makes me happy i love her so much with out her my life would be shit.. and i wouldn't be able to kiss such a beautiful girl.

family this week well yesterday my dad talked about where i went told him he was cool just said i should call and tell how i am. but whenever i want to i see my mom picking up the phone bitching like she always dose. so yeah.. found out that my brother is doing good in alaska.. he seems happy my mom hates my brothers up north cause there not pay rent reason i think im getting bitch at cause i was going to move up there but i think i need to be closer to the girlfriend so im not said i want this pelationship to last and i happy to say this relationship is the first to her that..&nbsp;

oh yeah ""paramore"" is playing in the background that bitch is hott but kayleigh is hotter if kayleigh was wearing what she is in that video i would probably nut my self.."

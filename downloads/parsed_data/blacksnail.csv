"event","Via some texts from Zach: The Red Cross is closing down the Dolly DR; everything is in pretty good shape and they're comfortable handing it back over to the local chapter. Edouard didn't do any damage, so there isn't a new DR. He's not sure when he's going to come home, and said he might try to spend a few days visiting Texas before heading back to DC. More as I've got it.

"event","Hey everyone.

I've been remiss in my updating, for which I apologize. Sadly, I don't have much time right now, and I also don't have my notes on me, so the highlights are:

Zach is doing well. He appreciates e-mails and text messages, though he has a hard time responding to e-mails because the computer at the hotel is unspeakably terrible.

He may be getting sent to Houston, as things wind down where he is. I'll know more soon, I think; Zach texted me with that info earlier today but had no details.

Someone fell off a forklift and put a hole through their hand and had to be sent to the hospital. It will require many surgeries. This is why we require training to operate forklifts.

They have a dog at the kitchen.

Kitchen 1's staff has been replaced by ""the Varsity team,"" and they kick pretty much all the ass. They are hyper efficient and very well-organized and well-trained.

Kitchen 1 has been doing something crazy like serving an average of 16,000 meals per day out of a very small facility. That is really incredible.

There's a movie theatre near by, and Zach went to see Dark Knight again. He liked it the second time, too.

That's all I've got for now. Like I said, he's doing well and seems in pretty good spirits, but drop him an e-mail if you're so  inclined. Contact with the outside world is a very good thing."

"event","Howdy everyone; Pam again. Talked to Zach for a while tonight, and in news that should surprise exactly no one, he's making friends and influencing people. Here are the highlights.

He's assigned to Kitchen 1, which is operating out of a church. Kitchen 1 is kicking all kinds of ass, serving more meals than anyone else and generally doing a really good job with a small space and limited resources. Other Red Cross types in the area are trying to figure out how they're doing it. I think Zach said they've served something like 14,000 meals so far.

Zach continues to get lost driving around. (Not his fault; trying to drive around in disaster zones is never an easy thing, because many of the road signs are gone, you never know when the road is going to become impassable, lights are out, detours are poorly plotted, and you're from out of town.) Those days are probably over now, though, because he has a pretty regular assignment, and it's not very far from where he's staying.

He went out on the ERVs twice, I believe -- dinner yesterday and lunch today -- and while there were only about 200 people who showed up for meals, they served something like 1,250 of them. Many of the less-damaged houses are crammed full of extended family members from the more-damaged areas, so people were showing up and taking quite a few meals back home. Yesterday, the National Guard also showed up where the ERV was serving lunch, and they gave cases of water to anyone and everyone who could carry one away. 

Most of the people seem in pretty good spirits, and it's kind of a waiting game right now: waiting for the power to come back on, waiting for the roads to be cleared. Most of the main roads are in pretty good shape, but many of the back roads are still under a lot of water, along with fields, yards, sidewalks, and everything else.

He met up with <lj user=""soldiergrrrl""> last night,  and you can look at pictures and get another perspective on things over in her LJ.

ERV crews typically comprise three people; Zach was the third on his ERV until today's dinner run, at which point the actual third showed up and he had to stay behind at the kitchen. While making himself useful, he ran into a guy named Jonathan, who's acting as ""yard dog."" This isn't an official position, but it's essential anyway; the yard dog makes sure all the ERVs get stocked and the kitchen runs smoothly. It's very logisticsy, all about coordination and communication and washing dishes and stocking shelves and hauling things around and directing traffic and brokering deals between stations in that sort of strange Red Cross barter economy that emerges during DRs. At any rate, Jonathan will be leaving on Friday, and he asked Zach to take over when he does. Zach agreed, and so he spent the rest of today shadowing him, taking notes, trying to figure out how he makes everything run smoothly.

Zach has spent a lot of time chatting up the ERV drivers, most of whom are old crusty Texans, and he's really enjoying talking to everyone. I guess the pastor of the church housing Kitchen 1 is also a really cool guy, and Zach spent quite a bit of time getting to know him while they worked. Much of the congregation is also pitching in.

He has scored a hotel room, which is awesome for a lot of reasons. Said hotel room is about ten minutes from the church (so hopefully the days of getting lost are mostly over). He doesn't have a roommate right now, but he expects that to change soon. The hotel does have a business center, so he has some limited access to his e-mail.

That's pretty much it. Zach continues to be in good spirits, and all the people down there are good people, and he's really optimistic about both the relief effort and the ability of the region to bounce back pretty quickly. More updates as warranted, probably every other day or so."

"event","I'm putting together a list of things that I will likely need to bring so I can keep my head straight related to all this goofiness. The target location is southern Texas in early August, which is apparently ""fry an egg on your forehead"" hot. If you have suggestions, shout 'em out. 

KEY 

! = Buy in Virginia 
$ = Buy in Texas 
X = I already have it 
+ = packed/ready to go

I'm sorting things into two groups - Need and Want. The Need has space and weight priority over the Want, obviously. If I can limit everything to carry-on I'll be doing fine. I'll drop in comments in various blocks. 

NEED 

+ 7 shirts (workout style, ""wicks away sweat,"" 
X 7 shorts (mostly cargo pants; a couple basketball shorts) 
X 7 pair underwear/socks 
+ waterproof work boots 
X toiletry kit 
$ basic toiletries (<a href=""#01"">1</a>) 
+ duffel bag 
+ backpack 
!/$ mini notepads (<a href=""#02"">2</a>) 
X pencils/pens 
X rain coat (I'm not entirely happy with the one I have but it's lightweight) 
X work gloves (just in case) 
X cell phone charger 
X hat (two: Red Cross hat for when I'm working, Cubs hat for when I'm undercover) 
$ sunscreen (SPF 50+) 
$ insect repellent 
X hand towel (not too bulky and absorbant) 
X disposable gloves 
X waterproof flashlight (always useful) 
$ spare batteries for flashlight 
!/$ whistle (because why not) 

WANT 

X digital camera w/case 
$ spare batteries for camera 
X books
X miniature camping pillow

<font size=""1"">(<a name=""01"">1</a>) I don't want to deal with the bullshit that is airport security at all, period. This means there's less to carry on the way there. 

Also, I don't plan on shaving while I'm down there. Basically, being around potentially contaminated water means you don't want to frequently run a razor over your face and open up your pores. Right now I'm clean shaven with a trimmed goatee (so I don't look 12). By Week 3 the slow-growth forest that is my beard will be in its ""angry hobo"" stage, but then I'll get home and hack it into ""pensive grad student"" format for the new job. 

(<a name=""02"">2</a>) Invaluable resource. Can fit in any pocket, allows for the writing down of things, which is really vital in a disaster operation. Names, numbers, addresses, vital info - you are only as good as what you know out there, and this is how you know.</font>

Okay, that's all I'm putting down for now because I'm tired and need to start thinking about sleep. I will have bedding of some kind provided for me so I'm not listing any of that stuff - same with hand sanitizers and food/bottled water. Any recommendations on over-the-counter medication? I'll need to run to CVS tomorrow."

"event","I'm heading to Texas to do Mass Care, which basically means feeding people. I have a tentative travel date of Saturday, leaving DC in the morning, and arriving at who knows where and when. From there it's to the organized chaos of the Disaster HQ which will direct me where to go and what to do. If everybody is really lucky the need for Mass Care will drop off fast, at which point I will transfer over to Client Services (casework that lets us account for those affected as well as provide them with assistance), or something else entirely - I'm really up for anything.

Tonight I head out and buy some clothes, shoes, etc. I plan to pack much lighter than last time as I was bit <i>too</i> prepared - it was a real pain to haul around and keep an eye on things. I'm going for lighter/more effective this time around rather than ""three weeks of backwoods camping."""

"event","So Disaster didn't send me out last month, which is fine because I found the time to become gainfully employed (barring any unforseen and frankly impossible issues with the background check and the drug test). I'll be doing web development at a behavioral healthcare insurance provider in the area for more pay, a shorter commute, and on the same team as a good friend of mine. I start mid-August and I'm really looking forward to the challenge.

I have until next Monday at the Red Cross, which means I am able to do what I did today - speak face-to-face with a very cool woman in Disaster about deploying to Texas to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Dolly. It turns out that a technicality prevented them from calling me last month - quite literally the wrong box was checked in the database, listing me as ""Inactive"" instead of ""Active"" - so that got sorted today. I should have a much better idea of what's going on tomorrow.

The very cool thing is that the new job said they can push the start date back a week or two to accomodate the Disaster relief if need be. That's one of the reasons I took the new job.

More news as I know it."

I won't know until tomorrow but I'm listing my availability to the Disaster folks as of Sunday, which likely means leaving Sunday or Monday.

"event","Hi everybody,

I am currently dealing with a bit of a conundrum. If I could ask some advice I would really appreciate it.

1) I was recently affected by a reduction at the Red Cross. I am employed through the 28th of July and then after that (if I haven't found an internal job) I am receiving severence until October. I am not in a bad place; I am apparently ""rather marketable"" which is always a good thing, and the DC area has beaucoup employment.

2) The midwest is undergoing some crazy storms which requires the kind of  disaster relief for which I am trained. I have an incredibly strong urge to go to my boss on Monday and see if I can push for a disaster relief assignment.

So, the advice requested. Do I:

a) Continue looking for a job. The job is the most important thing; I'd be an idiot not to keep pushing for something right now.

or

b) See about going to do some disaster relief for two or three weeks, which would of course delay my job search (or at least my capacity to interview). The reason being that people need help now and I'm qualified to do it. A job search is a job search and 2-3 weeks isn't going to hurt in the long run.

This is literally the shit that keeps me up at 5am.

Thanks,

-Zach"

"event","Last night a leprechaun woke me up in the middle of the night. He was doing a little jig on my desk, smoking a tiny corncob pipe, and singing a traditional tune of his people. (Leprechaun people, not Irish people. Oddly enough, I think it was a Gaelic version of Slow Ride.) I had no idea what to say so I just watched him dance for a few minutes and found myself clapping at the end of it.

He grinned, tipped his hat to me, and said:

""Thank ye, thank ye; right kind of you, laddie -
T'would warm the heart-cockles of blessed St. Paddy!
For applause is a right fine thing to be heard
When ye be expectin' naught - nor e'en a word!""

He looked thoughtful for a minute as if reliving old memories and blew a ring of smoke that turned into a shamrock. Then he blinked, smiled, and said:

""And now I'm away til next we should meet.
Perchance that yer clappin' would aught but repeat!""

""Wait,"" I said, ""Are you real, or am I dreaming?""

The leprechaun laughed from deep in his belly:

""If ye call life a dream, ye've done too much drinkin'
But knock 'em back, laddie, and stop all that thinkin'!
I'm real as can be, sure as day follows night.
Does such ken see cause to confound ye with fright?""

I shrugged. ""No, I'm oddly okay with all of this. But where did you come from? And where are you going now?""

Chuckled the leprechaun:

""Can't ye reckon it, laddie, or be it so hard?
For the end of me rainbow is yer new graphicks card!
We're now standard features, unlike years of old
For how else to keep us than with lining of gold?

Tis why there's such magic, beauty, and power
All nestled tight in that Athlon tower!
Now I feel dawn's approach and will cease my transgress 
And fer heaven's sake, boyo, don't call INS!""

He did a little dance and then, POOF, he turned into a glowing cloud of sparkling dust that hung in the air for a second before whooshing into my computer.

The whole situation gave me a lot to think about. So I waited half an hour until I was sure he was asleep, quietly opened the computer case, and snapped his tiny neck - quick, so he wouldn't feel a thing. Then I popped out the card, unscrewed the fan housing, and in my excitement I ripped the whole thing off of the card. 

To make matters worse, he was speaking figuratively. I think by ""gold"" he meant the quality of workmanship rather than, you know, actual gold being literally inside the thing. Now I'm out a high-end graphics card and I murdered a leprechaun, which while not technically against any U.S. law may come back to bite me in the ass.

I could really use some advice:

1) Can you recommend a good replacement graphics card? I had a GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB GDDR3 PCI-E 2.0 - do you know if the newer Radeons come with leprechaun onboarding, or is it a different technology? I went with GeForce because it is fairly ubiquitous, but I'm willing to put up with slightly less compatibility or possibly even a djinn if I have to.
2) The little guy is starting to stink of rotten thistle. Is there a proper way to dispose of leprechaun bodies? I can't exactly call the county on this one.
3) Do you have any idea of how to get rid of banshees? I don't even know if this is grounds for a-hauntin' but I'm trying to be proactive here.

Thanks!"

"event","Specifically, applying modern commodity price quotes to conversion rates of fantasy coinage. Ladies, behold my sexy math:

Value Per Troy Ounce

Platinum: 1759.00
Gold: 933.00
Palladium: 405.00
Silver: 17.20
Copper: 0.23

Palladium is a stand-in for the classic ""electrum,"" the red-headed stepchild of the fantasy monetary system. Nobody ever wants to find a big pile of electrum; it's like getting five ties for your birthday or taking a vacation in New Jersey instead of the Bahamas. (If you are yourself a red-headed stepchild, my apologies for comparing you to electrum.)

If we round values, we get a basic conversion of roughly:

75 copper per silver
25 silver per palladium
2 palladium per gold
2 gold per platinum

Some other numbers that are varying degrees of sexy:

7500 copper per platinum
4 palladium per platinum
50 silver per gold
100 silver per platinum

Merging this fantasy setup with modern U.S. currency, you have 75 copper pennies per 1 silver dollar (the standard). The $25 coin is palladium, the $50 coin is gold, and the $100 coin is made of platinum. There are a few gaps - the $25 coin is a decent enough stand-in for a $20 bill, but you'd think there would be at least a $10 and a 25-cent piece (3 of which equal a dollar).

What the heck would the material be for the 25-cent piece and the $10 coin?"

Underneath it's still mostly the same car, but it looks completely different and handles differently as well. I've described EB as ""the Oregon Trail of Antiquity"" before and haven't seen anything better, so I'll go with that.

This is the project I was working on which forever burned the Ancient Greek phrase for ""We're being cut to pieces!"" into my head. (<i>ka - ta - koh - PTOH - meh - tah</i>, if you were wondering.) It has been a very long road and EB very nearly did not see the light of day on three separate occasions, but none of that matters now. Over 200 people have been involved throughout the course of this project, all adhering to a single vision, and man does it show. I am frankly astonished that we managed to make the thing come across as professional as it does, and am glad that after two years of working on this thing I finally have the chance to play it."

The studio setup at AU is a bit unconventional. The actual recording booth is a 4' x 4' box with a small window pane on one wall and another wall with two sets of thick, sound-proof doors - one that opens from the inside, another that opens on the outside for two layers of protection. Beyond this is a larger recording studio that is mostly open, intended for bands to record. It also has two thick double doors.

Inside the booth we had a microphone with a ""pop filter"" (a mesh circle in front of the microphone) which to my understanding helps reduce the kinds of vocal noises you don't want to get such as ""plosives,"" which are most typified in an overly boisterous pronounciation of the letter P. It also catches small flecks of spit that could otherwise hit the microphone if a voice actor is particularly exuberant, which I'm sure you are glad to know. There were headphones connected to a wall output and a music stand where the voice actor would place the script.

The studio room is in a dedicated room next door and is actually a massive bank of equipment that wraps around three walls. There is no visual connection between the two rooms, just an audio connection through the talkback button on the board which allows you to speak into the actor's headset while you hold it down, like a walkie-talkie. The actor can then speak into the mic in response. The studio computer (a Mac locked in a secure cage) runs ProTools, a program used to record, mix, and process audio.

Throughout the recording sessions Chip, Lauren, and/or Toddles would man the board in the studio room and manually activate each recording track while the producer (myself) followed along with the script to ensure pronounciation and performance. The sound of Kostas' original recording would feed to the voice actor's headphones in the Box - twice at 70% speed, then once at 100% speed, followed by silence into which the voice actor would shout out the phrase in ancient Greek. The actor would use both the audio through the headphones and our phonetic script. Here's a sample of the script:

<blockquote>(152) GG1U_Attack_3 (Men, Attack) +++Literally means ""Fall upon the enemy like the wave on the shore!""
OWN-dress!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eh-kyou-mah-EE-neh-teh!

(153) GG1U_Attack_4 (Company, Forward!)
LOHK-hohs!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;em-PROHS!
NOTE: if you can do it, roll your R like he does.

(173) GG1U_Ladder_Attack_1 (Prepare the ladder! (for attack))
TESS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KLEE-mah-kohs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pah-rah-skeh-oo-EHN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EH-k/heh-teh!
NOTE: do not say ""skyou-EHN"" - this is a slight variation, ""skeh-oo-EHN""

(252) GG1U_State_Fire_at_will_On_1 (Shoot at the enemy when you get the chance!)
kah-tah-BAH-leh-teh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tay-EE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eh-oo-kay-ee-REE-ay-ee!
NOTE: he says something wrong for the last word - ignore the audio. THink ""K E Ree A E.""</blockquote>This process would loop three times for three total takes. If the actor clearly blew a line or requested an additional take, the person manning the boards would give them more. Generally we ran voice actors in shifts to avoid wearing out their voices, so you could expect to be recording for an hour or so before taking roughly that amount of time as a break.

One thing we learned about the Box - wear shorts and a t-shirt, and even then you're going to sweat yourself silly, so bring in half a liter of bottled water. We would typically air out the box between voice actors because after 10 minutes that thing smelled like a karate studio. I'm sure you're glad to know that as well.

We started in early April and ran recording sessions pretty much all weekend every weekend through the end of the month, from 10am through 10pm-midnight, depending on how we were feeling. We gave the best recording times to the voice actors who were not us and tried to take the crappier times ourselves, as we knew we were going to be in the studio regardless.

The process worked well, but because of all the shouting you had to be careful to avoid blowing out your voice. We managed to get through it all and our voice actors were gracious and did a fantastic job. Chip, Toddles, and myself managed to get through it without killing ourselves or each other, which I consider a success.

Part 4 coming soon, entitled ""Selecting the best of 5500 takes."" It's a real page-turner!"

We are currently setting up an upscale brothel on a small island north of Venice and are having to defend it from the not-so-upscale madames.

The card up our sleeve is an ally in the form of the all-but-exiled <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Franco"" target=""_blank"">Veronica Franco</a>, a savior of Venice who was then rejected from her own society for perceived immorality. Meets 2 weeks on, 3 weeks off.
<li><b>Superhero Cop Drama:</b> A Mutants & Masterminds game based on the premise created by Alan Moore's Top 10. We play the superhero cops in a city full of superheroes who get called in to handle the domestic dispute between Rubber Band Man and Lady Electric. Meets 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off.
<li><b>Act 3 of Requiem For A Dream:</b> an ongoing Orpheus game that is incredibly cinematic and has <a href=""http://www.edromia.com/orpheus/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a very cool website</a>. Okay, that's totally not the title, but Season 4 started us off on a rather significant downslope. Right now we're focusing on getting the band back together. Meets every 3 weeks or so.
<li><b>Eberronloft:</b> A pulpy horror game (think the Mummy movie or old Call of Cthulhu modules) set in the world of Eberron. Hasn't started yet but will shortly. Meets whenever my roommates (and house mascot) are bored and have a free night for a pick up game.</ul>

So last fall the Charlotte musician and guitar instructor spent $1,200 to convert his 1981 diesel Mercedes to run on vegetable oil. He bought soybean oil in 5-gallon jugs at Costco, spending about 30 percent more than diesel would cost.

His reward, from a state that heavily promotes alternative fuels: a $1,000 fine last month for not paying motor fuel taxes. He has been told to expect another $1,000 fine from the federal government.

To legally use veggie oil, state officials told him, he would have to first post a $2,500 bond.

<blockquote>At first all he could see were blurry flaws in the crudely blown glass, but then he saw movement in there, and focused on it - and for an instant he thought the bottle contained a featherless baby bird, swimming with deformed wings and legs in some cloudy fluid.

Then there was a voice in his head, jabbering shrilly in debased French. Thatch understood only some of it, enough to gather that the speaker was not only demanding chicken and rum, but protesting that it had every right to those things, and to as much candy as it wanted, too, and threatening dire punishments if any of the formalities of its invitation ceremony weren't performed with the greatest pomp and grandeur and respectfulness; and there'd better be no <i>laughing</i>. At the same time, Thatch got an impression of great age, and of a power that had grown vast...at such great personal expense that only a fragment of the original personality remained, like a chimney still standing in the heart of a furiously burning house. The senile petulance and the terrifying power, Thatch realized, were not contradictory qualities - each was somehow a product of the other.

Then it became aware of him. The tirade halted and he could sense the speaker looking around in some confusion. Thatch imagined a very old king, startled when he had thought he was alone, hastily arranging his robes so that they draped properly, and combing his sparse hair forward to cover his baldness.</blockquote>"

<strong>Saturday</strong>

I got some boxes in the mail for <a href=""http://www.gamegrene.com/node/790"" target=""_blank"">Ziggurat Con</a>, the first known gaming convention to take place in a warzone. Thanks to <lj user=""soldiergrrrl""> for the overseas packing advice. (""Do not use pork rinds or pornography as packing material: check."") By the final customs form my hand had turned into a T-Rex claw. I have grown to used to typing everything.

In the afternoon my friend Andrew picked me up to head to Matt & Lauren's wedding. He also loaned me some dress socks, as all of mine had apparently been thrown out in the move. I have no idea why. Perhaps I secretly hate dress socks?

The wedding was at a <a href=""http://www.lostcreekwinery.com"" target=""_blank"">vineyard</a> about an hour or two west of DC. I was an usher and ushed decently well for the first time doing so, I thought. The layout of the winery made it somewhat difficult to get around the chairs on the outside porch, so that was a little goofy, but I consider it a success if no elderly relative does a header into the wedding cake. I realized halfway through the ceremony that the shirt I was wearing was the same shirt I had on during...er...a certain portion of the bachelor party, but I figured it was a subtle blessing of fertility for the bride and groom.

I don't know why, but this wedding is the only one I've attended as an uninvolved guest which paced itself so well. (Ushing does not count as ""involved"" here.) The ceremony was short but well done. The newly married couple departed to the <a href=""http://www.myxertones.com/ringtone:22503/"" target=""_blank"">Peanuts Theme</a>, which I continue to maintain is the happiest music in the world. The reception was busy without being packed, the bar was open and serving wine and good beer (<a href=""http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer/dominion-oak-barrel-stout/32666/"" target=""_blank"">Old Dominion Oak Barrel Stout</a>), and the food was great. From there it moved on to the cutting of the cake and then dancing on an outside pavillion. It felt incredibly seamless.

I got to hang out with a lot of folks I hadn't seen together in a long while. Adam, Eddie, Mattski, John Sagum (who was the latter-day Dean Martin of the group), Bernie, Andrew, Brian, Becca, Anthony, Tracy, Camille, Mike, Jasmine, Martin, and a few others who I'm forgetting right now because I'm lame and forgetty. Also attending was Captain Karl, back from years of active duty in Iraq and a few weeks away from getting his PhD from <a href=""http://www.virginia.edu"" target=""_blank"">UVa</a>. Adam, Karl, Andrew, and myself were seated at the Delerium Tremens table, which was clearly a shout-out from the groom in a room of tables named after wines.

One of the groom's cousins attending had broken her neck while cliff-diving and attended wearing a <a href=""http://www.spineuniverse.com/displayarticle.php/article962.html"" target=""_blank"">Halo brace</a>. At one point Eddie decided it was his mission in life to set her up with Mattski, for reasons which I can only describe as potential for high comedy. All night long he would say some variation of ""That girl in the halo is totally into you, man. She's been looking your way all night."" Mattski is nobody's fool and would laugh good-naturedly but otherwise not respond to what was clearly Eddie screwing with him. As time passed she became halo-girl, but eventually somebody decided that she should be christened <a href=""http://blogs.theage.com.au/screenplay/archives/Master%20Chief.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Master Chief</a> to obscure it from the older relatives present. I'm not suggesting alcohol was at all a factor relating to any bit of this.

The winery closed down around 11pm and then we retired to the hotel which had an old Virginian manse attached as its suites. The whole manse was rented to people attending the wedding, which gave us license to hang out on the 2nd floor balcony and generally be loud and drinky until very late hours of the evening. I'm not just talking about the college folks I hadn't seen in forever, but the whole wedding party. It seemed a really weird thing to drink with your friends' parents and extended relatives, but it was a wedding, so I guess maybe not. After much celebration I retired to my hotel room and slept the sweet blissful sleep of the well-saturated, the kind that tells you all is right in the world and that everything will work out in the end."

"event","I'm going to break this up into multiple posts because so much happened this weekend.

<b>Friday</b>

I met up with <lj user=""ponsdorf""> and his lovely wife in Georgetown for drinks, dinner, and conversation. They were in town for Memorial Day activities with the <a href=""http://gatheringofeagles.org/"" target=""_blank"">Gathering of Eagles</a> (or ""Gathrina Iggles"" as they say in <a href=""http://www.pittsburghese.com/translator.shtml"" target=""_blank"">Picksburg</a>). Dinner turned out to be a cookout at a <a href=""http://www.freerepublic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Free Republic</a> counter-protest across from <a href=""http://www.wramc.amedd.army.mil/"" target=""_blank"">Walter Reed</a>. <lj user=""ponsdorf""> was very careful to explain exactly what it was and suggest dinner elsewhere if the idea didn't fly. It was polite of him to do so, and I appreciate not being sandbagged into an unexpected protest as much as the next person, but the whole concept intrigued me. Beyond this I had never been to Walter Reed which is where my dad was stationed in the 70s, so I jumped on the opportunity. I had my first encounter with a GPS mapping device on the way to the place and was thoroughly impressed.

Apparently Walter Reed buses wounded soldiers to dinner and shows on Fridays. As these buses left, they would drive past the Code Pink folks just outside the Walter Reed gate with signs that varied the gamut from many ""Bring Our Troops Home Now"" types on one end to a few ""Maimed For A Lie"" types on the other. The former weren't all that contentious on the face of it, although it seemed like an impossible sell to their target audience: wounded members of an all-volunteer military. The latter kind were especially obnoxious and underscored the vapid state of modern protesting which seems to be about feeling good about yourself for saying something contentious rather than, you know, accomplishing anything. I can't conceive of what they were doing beyond attempting to demoralize people who had lost limbs. Maybe I'm just not clever enough to understand what they were saying or why they were saying it, but I really didn't get their message or their audience. This seems to run contrary to the whole concept of public communication, so I give an F to the Code Pink protest on the basis of clearly not knowing what the heck they were doing.

The Free Republic counter-protest was really interesting. The placards and banners were directed at the soldiers themselves, saying things like ""Thank You For Your Service,"" ""Bless US Soldiers,"" ""You Make Us Proud,"" etc. The atmosphere was very much like a typical cookout with people hanging out and having a good time. It felt surprisingly welcoming and friendly and had people from all walks of life. I was introduced jokingly as <lj user=""ponsdorf"">'s ""liberal friend,"" which I think would amuse my local friends, but the response of the folks with only that to go by was ""hey cool, thank you for coming, have a burger."" Beyond that, its message was very clear and involved a lot of waving at honking cars and Walter Reed buses. The attitude toward the Code Pink folks was ""those guys are wacky"" rather than ""we should beat the crap out of those jerks."" I give the counter-protest an A- in conveying its message to its identified audience, dinging them only for the presumably cathartic but childish ""Pinko Hags"" Burma shave signs placed on the other side of the road.

Both sides had flags.

This has been my first real encounter with any protest activity in the DC area after eight years of living here. I have a healthy distrust of the madness of crowds, so I don't think it's something in which I'll ever participate, but it was definitely a positive experience to see these things actually happening in the largely apolitical city of DC. (Those of you who don't live here may find this an odd statement, but those who do should know what I'm talking about.) One of my biggest problems with this war has been that it seems to exist independently of most Americans. I can think of two people I know personally who are involved in any way; one I haven't seen since 1995. What else? I guess gas prices have gone up. There are a lot of news articles which are ultimately all derived from a single <a href=""http://www.theonion.com/content/news/middle_east_conflict_intensifies"" target=""_blank"">ur-article</a>. The president must get a commission for every time he says ""democracy"" or ""freedom"" in a speech. But life still goes on and it seems the war has been reduced to background noise and an abstract hobby horse trotted out every two years in order to troll for votes. It was refreshing to see people on either side of the street who were affected and attempting to affect.

After an hour or so I drove the Family <lj user=""ponsdorf""> back to the hotel - only I missed a turn and managed to show them far more of DC than I think they ever wanted to see. Liquor store, liquor store, pawn shop, liquor store... Eventually, with the help of the trusty GPS and my continuing moratorium on heeding red lights in traffic circles, we made it back to Georgetown safe and sound. After some more drinks and good conversation I headed home to pack for the Saturday wedding of my friends Lauren and Matt."

"event","The first thing I needed to do was get together some voice actors and for that we needed auditions. Chip suggested we approach the American University drama department and see if we could pitch it to prospective drama students as a way to get experience doing voice acting work for computer games with international exposure. Normally this would be a line of crap, but Europa Barbarorum has already been featured in a variety of international computer game magazines and will soon be getting a Stateside advertising push.

Chip talked to the department head who brought him to a few classes where he pitched it to the students. One issue is that we needed deep male voices for the voices and most of the drama classes were female, but we did stipulate that we only needed a deep male-<i>sounding</i> voice - as long as the actor could sustain that for the duration, we didn't care who they were. Chip spent about 30 minutes pitching our three audition sessions to two classes, then spent an hour composing an intricate email with all kinds of detail to be sent to the AU drama department listserv about the <i>non-paying</i> acting gig.

Meanwhile, I spent 2 minutes at my computer posting an advertisement on my LJ. Go me.

We had a varied response from people who hadn't read Chip's email (""I charge $50/hour""), some folks who thought we could hook them up with something else (""I can only do animal sounds, and I know you said you need male voices but if you can use animal sounds please consider me""), and those who clearly wanted any work whatsoever but wanted to do so on their own terms (""I speak French, what if I did it in French? I think that'd be so...experimental!""). Then there were the people who actually <i>had</i> read the email who approached it professionally. I imagine this is, on the smallest possible scale, exactly like Hollywood casting calls.

The audition script itself was a variety of 10 unit names and 10 battlefield commands, all at varying levels of complexity. These were selected by Kostas as a good representation of the variety the actors would encounter during the session, and he provided a massive translation document that included the filename, the sound file itself, the translation (ie ""We're being cut to pieces!""), and the transliteration (ie ""kah-tah-koh-P/TOH-met-hah!""). That way the actors we chose could play the sound file to practice this stuff ahead of time. I pulled the ones he selected and refined the transliteration for American actors, added character notes, and then printed up copies for the actors.

The auditions were pretty interesting but the turnout was low. During our second of three sessions I was concerned that we wouldn't hit the target number of five people, so Chip, myself, and Toddles (one of the sound guys working the board) all decided to audition as well just to bulk up the number. The output was to be judged anonymously by three Ancient Greek linguists scattered across the globe, so it wasn't a concern that we'd ""have the fix in"" or anything insidious. On the contrary, not one of us actually wanted to scream ancient Greek into a microphone for 11 hours, in the box, for no pay. However, we figured that if any one of us was selected, we at least know we could be counted on to be around and committed to completing it.

We ended up with seven total actors including ourselves, which meant that one of us was likely going to have to draw the short straw. But before we could do that, we needed to get the audition files to the linguists. This involved a ""bounce session,"" where you go through each all the takes of each actor's line and select the best one, then export that file to .WAV format. With 3 takes per line, 20 lines, and 7 actors, that was 420 takes we listened to in order to produce 140 sound files. It took us roughly three hours to do this once we got into the rhythm. After that we zipped up the files for actors A through G, uploaded them to an FTP server, and informed the linguists who would take roughly a week to get back to us.

A few days later we got the list they selected, which included Chip, Toddles, and myself.

"event","For the past year or so I have been working on a not-for-profit historical computer game called Europa Barbarorum which I can most succinctly describe as ""the Oregon Trail of Antiquity."" The goal of the game is to present the interactions of nations and empires, the nature of their economies, and the importance of governance in conquered lands. (It's a total conversion mod of the Rome: Total War engine, if such language makes any sense to you.)

The team is a multi-national collection of Latin/Greek professors, historians, linguists and archaeologists, with technically skilled people to do the actual work of implementing the ideas in the game. This gives us the advantage of people who can include things they have literally dug from the ground. There is some good-natured ribbing between the first group and the second group. For example, the game uses the culture's own language to describe buildings, city names, or units. I, among other technically minded folks, pestered the historians about this inherent incomprehensibility because if you weren't a historian you couldn't tell what the heck was what. Now there is a plain English description after the name so you can tell what the heck it is, but for a while it was pretty obnoxious. ""I'm glad I don't have to deal with all this Ancient Greek stuff,"" I remember saying to somebody at some point last year.

Meanwhile Kostas, one of the team members had converted all of the original game's vocal recordings for the Greek-speaking nations from English to Ancient Greek. The problem was that with six Greek-speaking nations, anytime one Greek-speaking nation fought another it sounded like the attack of the clones. This was a really minor issue in the long run, but in the back of my mind I thought it would have been nice to get some variation in there.

This past January I approached Chip, a friend of mine who is a grad student in American University's Audio Tech department. I asked: Would it be possible to audition voice actors who could, using Kos' originals as a ""guide track"" and a transliterated script, perform their own versions of the Greek lines? Also, could we do it for free at the AU A-Tech studios? Chip countered with: Can you write this up as a proposal for my professor so that my grad-school partner and I can do this as independent study? Sure thing, sez I, and I did. The professor approved. Greenlight, greenlight, greenlight.

Then we sat down to do the math. We would need 5 voice actors. We would need to record 281 commands, plus 87 unit names (used for identification purposes when you click on them), for a total of 368 lines per actor. That's 1840 total sound files. We would also likely need to do 3 takes per actor per line, which meant we would end up with 5520 total line recordings, all of which we would need to go through recording by recording to determine which was the best take.

Ack.

Then, more math. Due to the way we were using guide tracks - play the original sound twice at 70% speed, then once at 100% speed, then 5-10 seconds of silence where the actor could perform the line, done three times to get each take - we calculated that three takes would take 1 minute per unit and 2 minutes per command. That's 649 minutes total, which works out to just under 11 hours per voice actor in the studio. In ""the Box,"" a 4' x 4' recording room that is a constant 20 degrees hotter than room temperature. Shouting ancient Greek into a microphone. For no pay.

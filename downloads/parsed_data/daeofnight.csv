A bear.<br>27) Has <lj user='lil_duck_7'> dyed their hair? Yes, she is such a crayon head!<br>28) How many monkeys could <lj user='kayaxadrian'> fight at once and win against? Ooo, she's crafty!

It's this crazy world we live in.  He showed up on this planet like some groovey jello-mold, primed for success, but Earth just wasn't ready.  Ohh woah is he for he is out cast... doomed to a life of eldritch fascination with all things spruce beer.<br>30) Would <lj user='theschizm'> go out with <lj user='lil_duck_7'>?   I couldn't allow that even if there were a possibility of it.  She just isn't geek enough for him.<br></lj-cut>"

"event","Lately I've had this itch.  A need for a really good game.  No computer games have really piqued my interest, so I turned to the classics.  Both Nintendo and Super Nintendo churned out some timeless games that are always fun... Hell, even Sega Genisis was good for a few.  So, I fired up my emulators and started going through my list of ROMs.  I managed to kill a mess of time, but it just felt so empty.

Playing was just too much of a hassle, but it wasn't until Toronto beat me twice in Blades of Steel as Vancouver that I figured out the problem.  It was one of those aggravating moments where you realize you don't have what you need to be satisfied.  It's like when there's a big jar of salsa in the fridge but no tortilla chips to go with it...  I digress.  What I need is a new game-pad.

The Nintendo introduced us to the concept of a game-pad as a perfect control device.  We just couldn't see it at the time.  That's why people bought that stupid <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/ok2/stepinto/PowerGlovePage.html"">Power Glove</a>.  Sure it looks cool, and you'd think it would make playing games more fluid, but when it comes down to, it's just dumb.  Just because everyone was infatuated with virtual reality back then someone decided that there would be a market for wearing controllers.  I'm just glad that they stopped with hands.  Though some freaks enjoyed wearing their <a href=""http://www.virtual-boy.org/"">system as goggles</a>, but once again I digress.

My point is, that the game-pad is god. With that glorious piece of electronics we are given the chance to use our thumbs to the fullest.  I'd go so far as to say that we're top of the food chain cause no creature on this planet could beat one of us at Super Mario.   My problem, though, is that I'm stuck using my keyboard.  That's just not right.

With a game controller in my hand <em>I</em> am a god.  There isn't even a need to account for reaction time.  My thumbs find the buttons by reflex.  The little sprite on the screen becomes an extension of ME.  With a keyboard I'm lucky if I can choose the play I want in Techmo SuperBowl.  Not to mention I'll probably get carpal-tunnel from it.

Well, out of curiosity, What's your favorite game-pad design?

flaws-
NES controller= too small; too few buttons but good enough for the games of the time; those corners could be a pain
SNES controller= still too small; slanted buttons?  what the hell is that?
Sega Genesis controller= awkward shape; buttons wore out fast
N64 controller= I don't have three hands!
PS controller= direction buttons weren't independent enough
Gamecube controller= are you on crack?
PS2 controller= fragile analogue sticks
XBox controller=  not made for human hands

Flaws aside, lemme know your favorite game-pad and why (doesn't have to be on my list of flaws) and if you have any recommendations on a good USB controller I'd be much obliged.  thanks"

"event","""The point of all this is that the priests of death aren't usually the evil or mischief-making types.  Of course there are always exceptions but especially in this case they're very rare...  Just hold on one second.""  I hold up my hand in front of the young bounty hunter's face to stop whatever ignorant or contrived remark he was obviously about to add to our conversation.  Turning to our lovely barmaid, who, at the moment is waiting on someone a few tables over, I call to her with the jingle of a few silver pieces in my hand.  By the way, that little trick always works wonders on bar wenches.
As soon as she finishes passing out drinks at the other table she walks up to me and gently plucks the coins from my expectant hand.  She stares at me with a kind of impatient curiosity while I ogle her.  I'm actually only stalling to make my ""friend"" across the table sweat a little; too impatient, that one.  ""If you'd be so kind as to bring us a pitcher of ale and a bottle of fine mead I'm certain that we'd be much less of a bother to you... that is, unless you'd like me to be bother you?""  I smirk and chuckle as she leaves with a short sigh of exasperation.  However, the joy of hitting on barmaids is cut short by the impudent stare of my companion and the exasperating conversation at hand.
""Okay, let me explain.  For whatever reason, whether you take it as a sign of the apocalypse, ragnarok, what have you, the priests of death determined that the dead were rising because the border between life and death had all but collapsed.  So, with all their new found knowledge of the workings of death, spirits, and the afterlife, an extremely large number of priests of death teamed up to recreate the barricade between planes.  Ever since then the apparently dwindling number of priests of death have been devoted to the research and utilization of their powers over death.""
As my story concludes, the barmaid places the pitcher and bottle on the table and I commence pouring.  ""Would you get to the point already!?"" My impatient friend growls from across the table.
I lean back in my chair with a drink in each hand and stare at him amusedly for a moment.  ""The 'point' will arrive in due time."" I admonish him, sipping my drinks as I continue.  ""As far as I know, the priests of death now only exist as an underground society, as things dealing with the undead are... hmm... shall we say, not accepted by, well, anyone?  Not outwardly at least, but I digress.
You see, due to the mass use of necromancy for evil purposes, the undead and those associated with the undead are pretty well hated by everyone... you know this of course.  Well Mordell, being the eccentric he is, took it upon himself to educate the masses about death and the ways of his priesthood.
So, Derrelleth starts by scheduling fancy dinners with various groups of the wealth and nobility across the land.  At these dinners the main course is a dish called Turducken, which is a chicken stuffed inside a duck stuffed inside a turkey.  This is the model Derrelleth uses for his explanation.  You see, our bodies (the turkey) are just a shell, a machine that allows us to affect the physical plane.    Our bodies then contain an inner shell (the duck) which is what houses our spirit.  This is what allows our souls to inhabit and exert control over our bodies.  The soul (the chicken) is the only thing that can then stand alone as an entity, but the other two layers are necessary for that entity to exist in the physical plane.
I could go on to explain the mechanics of death and undeath using this model but you don't care about that.  You want to know what this has to do with Derrillith's... let's say, unpopularity.  Well, that's the second portion of his demonstration.  After the dinner finishes, he takes his guests to a nearby graveyard so they can get a first hand demonstration of a priest of death's knowledge and skill.  Of course, this means digging up a body, and, let me tell you, that never goes over very well.""
My ""friend's"" frustration with me immediately turns into a look of defeat. ""So, all this is nothing more than a silly spat over some question of dignity raised by this one man's treatment of the dead?""

Now it is important to note here that I have recognized my companion.  His name is of no consequence.  He's an annoying little upstart of a bounty hunter.  Always looking to make easy money off of the alleged misdeeds of others, but ever unwilling to get his hands dirty.  He's made a pest of himself in the past as I'm sure he will again.

Well, I see our conversation is ending, and so in these few moments before I answer his question I must make my move, lest I'll have to pay for my drinks.  He owes me for the information I just gave him anyway.  So, noticing that the drink has almost run dry, I raise up my last full cup.  ""Yep, nothing more.  Sorry to say, he's worthless to you.""  With that I tilt my glass back and I don't stop till I hit the floor.  My eyes roll back into my head and I'm out.

You see,  raising my cup was to signal the barkeep, a good man who knows me well, that my companion is paying.  So, by forcing myself to pass out, that idiot of a bounty hunter will be stuck with the bill and I'll be carried off to my room for some much needed rest."

"event","First of all read my new comic over <a href=""http://euphoricfever.keenspace.com"">here</a>.  It's just started and and I'm finding I really suck at building web-pages but I'll figure it out.

Secondly in case you wanted to know <a href=""http://www.wxplotter.com/ft_dead.php?im"">

Now onto the lesson.  Like any good scientific example this little explanation of the water ice phenomenon will be set up like a physics problem.  As we all know physics problems start with a generically named person, like Timmy, who is in an every day situation.
So here we have Timmy.  Timmy has a commercial sized walk in freezer.  He stores corpses in it so that he can cannibalize them later.  Now Timmy has had this freezer for some time and it no longer runs as well as it once did and he can't get it fixed because he's sure that freezing dead bodies voids the warranty.  As a result the condenser drips a small amount of water into the freezer.  Let the amount of water that drips into the freezer per day equal x.
If Timmy allowed the water to fall indiscriminately into the freezer it would collect on various surfaces and freeze.  This being the case a large amount of ice would soon build up forcing the murderer, I mean Timmy, to allow the freezer to defrost and thaw out.  This is to be avoided as it would get quite bloody and cadavers go bad at a very rapid rate.  To prevent this from happening Timmy has placed a cardboard box strategically to collect the dripping water.  Allow the cardboard box to equal k.
As the cardboard box fills with ice it becomes necessary to dispose of the ice.  Make the ice equal to you aren't going to use these variables.  Upon plugging our variables into the formula (x+k=unimportant) we find that the quickest method of doing this is to pour water over the enormous box shaped chunk of ice.
You see water's cohesive properties (that is to say it's ability to form bonds with like particles or, in other words, stick to itself) aid in the melting process by ripping water molecules from there crystalline formation as the temperature change weakens the bonds that hold them in place.
So there you have it.  Now Timmy can go on with his life like a happy cannibal, no longer needing to worry about how to deal with a surplus of nasty ice."

1. Grab the nearest book.
2. Open the book to page 123.
3. Find the fifth sentence.
4. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.
5. Don't search around and look for the ""coolest"" book you can find. Do what's actually next to you.

""So pick me a good thick science fiction novel with lots of obscure technical terms.""
This is, of course from ""Oath of Fealty"" by Larry Niven  & Jerry Pournelle.  An excellent book by two excellent science fiction writers.  Niven is well known for crazy science fiction taking place in deep space with interesting alien races in abnormal situations that almost seem plausible.  Pournelle, on the other hand, is known for putting the science back in science fiction.  So, in other words, its a great book since Niven's creativity makes Pournelle's down to earth style a pleasure to read.
The line I quoted was spoken by Preston Sanders to the chief engineer, Tony Rand.  If you wanna know more, look it up.
Now, in all honesty this book was not right next to me, but that's cause none were.  So I ran to my room and got the first book off my floor I came to.  That was the book I'm currently reading, ""Mindbridge.""  I couldn't use that book, though, since page 123 only has 4 sentences.  So I grabbed the book next to it, Oath of Fealty.

Now, onto today's musical interlude.  My music for today is perfect for it since it's a revelation inspired by Iron Maiden.  The main differences between my revelations and Iron Maiden's being fewer wicked riffs.  I'm planning to work on that.
Well, have you ever noticed that there are a whole mess of rock and metal legends still around, still touring?  Prime examples being Kiss, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Aerosmith, and of course Iron Maiden.  Well, I have finally deduced why that is.  Only a very small percentage of rock and metal bands survived there constant substance abuse long enough to get very far into their respective carreers.  Past a certain point there is a push for the band to clean up.  Those that survive to this point are the fittest.  By Darwinian logic they possess traits lacked by those who could not survive that make them more suitable for their new environment in their respective genres.  In other words, these are the super bands that can not be defeated by normal means, and as long as catastrophe does not befall them they will simply, very slowly, grow old and burn out.
An example of the catastrophe clause I spoke of would of course be Led Zeppelin.  They were so awesome it took a twin catastrophe to kill them, i.e. the death of John Bonham and Robert Plant's son.  Though there is nothing wrong with the catastrophe way outt, since it furthers your legend status.
Another revelation has befallen me in this metal groove.  Alot of the Titans of the hair band era like to blame Nirvana for the downfall of metal.  I blame the hair bands themselves for selling out.  They rehashed their songs way too many times in order to fund their addictions.  Nirvana put metal out of it's misery by giving people something else to listen to.  Besides, we all know that metal can never truly die.
My final point that I have to make which will conclude this musical interlude is that Iron Maiden is almost too awesome.  Now, if just listening to it is not enough to convince you of this fact, go watch ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.""  I don't care what you think of the movie.  My argument is that Iron Maiden is so awesome Bill and Ted's goal that they dreamed of was to simply OPEN for them.  That's like saying Iron Maiden is so awesome that the pinnacle of our career would be to simply introduce them.  Go Iron Maiden, go!  You rock, rock on!"

"event","It's been a dry week.  Not a drop of rain to speak of.  The dust kicked up by a thousand steps sticks to my sweat stained tunic and cakes onto my skin.... There, up ahead, is the oasis I've been questing for, The Serpent's Tongue Tavern.
Most of the taverns I frequent have caught on that I drink till I'm unable to order another.  Haveing this knowledge, most bartenders have taken it upon themselves to water down my drinks so that I'll last longer, thus allowing them to further empty my purse.  Out of courtesy I ignore this and in return they drag me to a room once I pass out.  The Serpent's Tongue, however, does not engage in such fraudulent business tactics.
Upon entering the, oh so, inviting blood stained and ale soaked doorway a stranger catches my attention.  He waves for me to come over but I'm skeptical.  If it were a well endowed young woman I'd be just as suspicious but much more likely to join her, regardless.
Even so, in hopes of a free drink, I sit down across the young man and it hits me.  I know him.  I don't know how but I'm sure I recognize that face.  That goofy yet, debonair expression and those cold, calculating eyes seem to be staring at me not only from across the table but from somewhere in my memory.
""Will it be ale or mead tonight, wanderer?"" my companion inquires.
Well, seems to be paying off at least.  He even knows my drink.  ""Both, if you'd be so kind.""
""I should have known."" He says with a grin as he beckons for a wench.  A leggy, young auburn haired beauty nearby walks over just in time to hear the order. ""Two meads and a flaggon of good ale should get us started.""
Without a word the wench heads off behind the bar to fill our drinks and my friend brings his attention back to me.
""I am most fortunate to find you here.  I am in need of information and I cannot think of a better provider.""  The wench cuts him off to deliver our drinks and my thoughts wander away with her.  They don't get very far, though, thanks to my curious compatriot as he continues in hush tones, ""I've been hearing a name quite a bit lately: Derrelleth Mordell.  It would seem that he's trying to cause a ruckus.  Gossip speaks of him being some sort of Priest of Death.  Perhaps his death would be worth something and perhaps I could be the one to collect.  If anyone could give me reliable information about him I suspect it would be you.""
I had known this Derrelleth.  As such I can't help but stare blankly till the laughter has a chance to catch up with me.  ""Derrelleth is nothing but an eccentric old upstart who couldn't cause trouble if he tried!"" I gasp out between fits of laughter.  ""I should know, I've seen him.  He might as well try to kill a starving man by feeding him.""
""But what of all this Priest of Death talk, then?""
I down my ale and call for another as I explain.  ""Yes, he is a priest of death, but it's not what you think.  You see, long ago there was a tremendous problem with the undead.  No one knew why the dearly departed refused to rest in peace but something had to be done about it and quick.  Yet there weren't enough people with the ability to bless all the dead bodies of the world.
""So, certain priests began specializing in death and the undead.  Their main task was to bless all those who died who had yet to grow restless in their graves but they also were charged with dealing with those who already had become undead.  Eventually, they became aware of the workings of death which later was used as the basis for necromancy.""
I pause to allow my bewildered friend a chance to mentally catch up but he is unwilling to wait for things to come together naturally.  After a few blinks he asks, quite perturbed, ""What does this have to do with Derrelleth!?""
""Just keep the drink flowing.  I assure you that I'll get there sooner than later."" I proceed to down both ale and mead, clear my throat and continue my story..."

Anyway...
This week obviously was election day.  It made me realize something.  This country should not be allowed to have democracy simply because the American people are too stupid to make a decision.  Look at it, we can't even make a decision on our own.  We need other people to narrow it down for us.
So we get a choice of a or b and we still get it wrong.  Oh sure, you could vote independent but what good does that do.  Like I said, our choices are narrowed for us.  Throughout history we've had two parties.  They could be dissolved any time, but we're too stupid to get away from them.
For two hundred years we've been tricked into thinking that our opinions matter when in fact they don't add up to shit.  We're told what we need and we bend over and take it.  There's a limitless amount of possibilities, endless solutions to every problem yet we always choose democrat or republican, even though we're fucked either way.
Oh, and in case you're still under the delusion that your vote mattered, take a moment and think back.  Bush started publicizing a victory wednesday, midday.  He hadn't won yet.  In fact he still hasn't won.  The electoral college doesn't vote till December second and the victory won't be official till January.
It just doesn't matter.  No matter what, things are just gonna get worse.  The American people just don't WANT to think for themselves.  There's tons of resources out there to help make an informed decision but apparently that's just too much work.  In fact, the <strong>only</strong> reason we ever get a different president these days is because there's a two term limit."

Yeah, I can take down a fuckin' army of anything those bastard Pfhor could even THINK of sending at me if I had a fully loaded assault rifle complete with a few grenades, bud, sadly, I ran out of anything like that two missions ago.  My last rocket was spent taking down  a batch of hunters and my fusion pistol blew up due to an unstable battery.

Well, seems all I got left is my pistol.  I'd be useing two if I had more than one clip.  But who knows, after all, I started out with nothing but a pistol and that was days ago and who knows how many aliens I've reduced to goo since then.
Maybe things wouldn't seem so bad if those blasted AI's running this ship would give me some help.  I'm not asking much, just a little direction, but they seem content to just drop me in the middle of a battle just as soon as I've won the last one.
Well, I'd best be on the move.  This ship is so fuckin' huge, there's an almost endless amount of area to be secured...  I'm tellin' ya, if I make it through this alive, I'm demanding a raise and my assault rifle won't be satisfied till I get one.

Maybe I should start writing this for my amusement.  Would probably be easier to keep up.  So maybe I should start over...
I'd probably be comfortable if not for the pain in my back.  And I'd probably be happy if it weren't for this wretched reality.  And I'd probably be optimistic if I had anything to look forward to.

So, I would like to thank my girlfriend's bitch of a mother for taking all the joy out of my life and leaving me with nothing but an endless load of shit.  A big thanks to all you gay ass fucks at school.  Stupid bastards, can't get over yourselves for fuck.  You can't see me but I'm flipping you  off right now, you stupid assholes. You think you know every fucking thing, but you don't know shit about anything.  You're the ones who make school the hellhole it now is you incompetent, useless, mother-fucking bitches.
If that isn't enough I got the school administration breathing down my neck with their dumb-ass rules that they are so damned anal about.  They assume I'm like those stupid fuck ups that wind up in detention everyday and wind up estranging me from my friends at school.  Ooo, and I can't forget  my dumb-ass teacher.  The only person more narrow-minded, incompetent and stupid than her is my girlfriend's bitch of a mother.
Oh and of course there's always my friends.  Like they give a fuck.  They'd be just as happy without me.  I suppose I shouldn't be so harsh on all of them seeing as I can usually count on most of them when I'm in a jam.  But there's always some that have to screw up important plans, or try to take control of things, or try to make everything about them, or leave me out entirely.  Then there are the ones that screw with my relationship.  Grrr, this part would be far easier if such a large percentage of my friends weren't so fucking good to me but I suppose this way is better.
Now finally onto my girlfriend herself.  Yeah, she may very well be the best thing to happen to me, but all the shit that's happened to me seems to have found it's way to me through her.  Like this crap that happened with Dan.  I blame MK.  She blurts some crap to Dan cause she's mad, so Dan confronts Chris and she gets depressed for two days.
What pisses me off most is how everything is supposed to be fine after apologies are done.  Just because people are nice to her, she forgets all the crap they put her through.  Well she drags me along through it too and I can't fucking take it anymore.
Of course I can't forget the prom crap.  Would she just take the fucking dress she likes and be done with it, damn it.  She had no right to pressure me in the first place.
Now today I came home from the pops concert and she wasn't on.  The concert went well too.  I still say Bohemian Rhapsody came out crappie the way we sung it and still no one got the ending to Stairway to Heaven, but al in all it went well.  Anyway, I find an e-mail from Chris saying she had just gone to bed.
What the fuck.  I wait up for her all the time ALL the time.  She barely ever does  anymore.  Normally it wouldn't bother me so much but that was my one chance today to talk to her.  What's more annoying is that at the same time I feel awful for being late even though it wasn't my fault.
I'm so sick of feeling like shit.  I thought about breaking up with her, but it just doesn't make sense.  She's the one that makes me happy.  So I guess I just have to wait for the other shit to go away."

"event","So, I got a new hard drive.  One of my computer's biggest problems is a lack of hard drive space, sure it could also use a little more ram but I'll tackle that another day.  Drive space is my key issue right now.
For those of you in the know, my comp is a Macintosh 450mhz G3 Blue and White Yosemite revision 2 tower.  So, my first task was to find a compatible drive which wasn't that hard seeing as the blue and white has almost every connection possible on it.  Yet I still hat to figure out what the hell kind of drive to get.  The clear choice was between IDE/ATA or SCSI.
Before I did anything else I wanted to figure out what the hell I was doing.  So I researched stuff about my computer specifically and then looked into how all the hardware works.  http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/IDE.html had some very interesting articles about my comp including illustrated instructions on how to slave a second IDE hard drive onto your preexisting one...  intriguing!  http://www.howstuffworks.com/index.htm was great for explaining how all this computer crap worked.  So, after my studying I was confident in my decision to buy an IDE hard drive.
My system currently runs on an 8 gigabyte hard-drive so I figured I'd want my new one to have at least 20 gig.  So, after much dissatisfaction with prices on ebay, and dodging a few scams a ran into a great deal over at powermax.com .  They had a 40gig Maxtor EIDE 7200rpm hard-drive with 2mb of backside L2 cache for 68 bucks.  Just so you know, that's a sweet deal.
Well, my hard-drive came in and I couldn't install it because I didn't have the screws.  Yet there was one other problem.  I couldn't tell what the hell was goin on in my machine.  The drive where my master hard-drive was supposed to be wasn't plugged in and there's a very long ribbon cable stretching to a drive on the other side of the machine from one of the cards in a pci slot.  Very confusing.
I gotta figure it out before I can even attempt to install my new drive, so Sam gives me a hand.  Together we get things apart enough to realize that the drive that isn't connected is an old 1 gig scsi drive we had gotten for an old computer.  Jeep stuck it in there for safe keeping.  So since Sam has the comp that drive was meant for he's taking it. 
The next big revelation was that the hard drive the system is running on now is a scsi drive.  one of the pci slots has an ultrascsi card that it's hooked up to.  So, I don't have to slave this new drive.  All I need is a new ide cable.  In fact, Sam used the screws that were holding the 1 gig drive to the bracket to stick my new drive in there.  The power is hooked up and everything.  I just need that new freakin cable."

After I got out of my shower I went directly for the computer.  Chris was there (hey something else that was good!) so I sat down and talked with her online for a while.  We were flirting but then she goes off about her stupid survey crap.  She really pissed me off, so I went to go get dressed and get a cup of tea.  I had been determined to not get pissed, but everything she said just got me more and more angry.  So she had to leave, and that was it.  I went around the house slamming things and swearing.
She calls me up not too much later.  I would have been angry at her, but I was too shocked.  We talked and resolved the fight, but my day was already ruined.
I thought I was better, but I couldn't seem to take an interest in anything.  I got to the point where I was just moping around looking for something to do.  9:30 I got to talk to Chris again, but it was like my brain was scrambled.  I couldn't think or anything.  I'd claim I was unconscious, but I know I could see.  It took her a while, but she cheered me up.

"event","Ah, St. Patty's  day.  Irish punk anyone?  Come on, you gotta love Flogging Molly.  I'm just sad that I didn't get my traditional supper of corn beef and cabbage.   Mmmmm.
Ok, so, interesting story.  It was about a year and a half ago.  A couple of my Californian friends had just been to a concert.  So, I'm talking with Whitney about.  They went to see a band named Flogging Molly.  Now, when Whitney is fired up about something she doesn't necessarily sound <em>terribly</em> excited about it, but she has a way of piquing one's interest.  I think her friends all share similar interests in stuff only because she got them all excited about the same things.  So, anyway, she gets me to download a few Flogging Molly songs.  I gotta say, they were good.  So, Sam, my brother, finding out about my interest in them, bought me the Drunken Lullabies cd for Christmas.  Woohoo!  Sure comes in handy this time of year.
Anyway, today should have been a snow day.  We only got a delay, though.  grr.  At east nothing happened in school.  Though, maybe it would have been better if something had happened.  It was so boring.  I was just waiting for the end of the day, and wow was it a long wait.
I got to see Chris in Chess club, but it was frustrating.  She normally comes home with me on Wednesdays, but couldn't this time.  I knew that I wouldn't get to see her outside of school for a week and that really got to me.
Then at home nothing happened.  I got to be on the phone with Chris, but that wasn't really good either.  She was busy with homework and stupid shit surveys she had to do for her mom. <em> * stifles an outburst of rage * </em> So, because she was busy she couldn't pay much attention and couldn't talk much either.  Frustrating, but I dealt with it to talk with her.  I was so caught up with her last night too.
I was reading Dune before going to sleep.  The end of the part I read made me think so much of her.  I could almost feel her with me.  Here's the key line, though it loses alot of it's meaning without a few preceding pages.  ""I see us giving love to eachother in a time of peace between storms.  It is what we were meant to do.""
Now I'm just out of it. I'm frustrated from today and tired out from dealing with it.  So I guess I'll go sleep."

"event","I never thought I could hate someone so much... *deep breath*  I'll work my way up to it.
You see, today was supposed to be a snow day.  Well, it wasn't.  We had an announced early dismissal instead.
So, when my mom woke me up she told me about this and asked if I wanted to go to school.  I was supposed to have lunch with Chris and I really didn't want to miss that, but I just couldn't get up.  I was so tired.  I wound up sleeping till eleven.
So, after getting up and waking up, I make my way to the computer.  So, I come to find Chris online.  I was really excited that she had gotten out of school already I felt really bad about that.  So, I'm giving her my heart felt apology and right afterwards I come to find out it's actually her bitch mother.
She was fucking pretending to be her fucking daughter.  She even talked to me as if she were her, that mother-fucking ass-hole of a bitch. *stifle* <strong>gRRRRrr</strong>.  The whole thing gets sorted out and when Chris finally is talking to me <strong>SHE YELLS AT ME</strong>.  What the <strong>FUCK</strong>.
That got me so fucking mad.  I was mad at her, but it's not her fault that her mother is one of the most wretched piece of illegitimate FUCK to ever curse this existence with her fucking presence.  <strong>She got the apology meant for Chris</strong>.  You know what, she doesn't even count as a mother.  No one without a fucking soul can be given that title of honor.  No, she's not even fucking human.  She's just a worthless fucking wretch for whom hell is too good for.
She's got alot of damned fucking gall too.  She tried to explain it all away.  Fuck her, if Chris hadn't already calmed me down and if I hadn't already been so tired from being so angry before I would have told her exactly what kind of bitch she is and cursed her out for all the evil fucking shit she's pulled.
It's all her fault that me and Chris had a fight and it's her fault that my entire fucking day was ruined.  She'll burn for this, but she'll get worse for the rest of her shit."

"event","This weekend was really great... up until now.  I mean, just look at yesterday!  <em>*points down*</em> Moving on, today I stayed home from church and slept in.  Between getting over this cold and staying up late I was just too tired.
So then my grandparents came over and we partook of the muffins my mom made... <em>mmmMMmm <strong>muuuuffiinnnsss</strong></em>.  The muffins were <strong>blueberry</strong>.  <em>*wipes away the drool from his lower lip</em> (so I like muffins... alot.  What can I say)  After they left I took the shower I'd been dying for (I felt so gross).  Of course while I was in there who was to show up but Sam and his new girlfriend, Jill.
Lemme tell ya, it's kind of unsettling when the first time somebody sees you, you're wearing nothing but a towel.  The fact that she was my brother's girlfriend didn't make it any better either.  At least I'm not as insecure as I used to be.
They left shortly, which I figured would give me a chance to do some stuff on the computer.  *<strong>WRONG</strong>* no more than 15 minutes later I was asked if I was ready to go.
Me and my parents were heading over to my Aunt Jeanne and Uncle Brian's house for supper and a game of cards.
Oh well, I was pretty much okay with it since Chris told me she'd be away all day do doing surveys for her mom. . *stifles an outburst of rage towards ultra-bitch* ehem.  So I'd be occupied and have some fun and good food too, while keeping my mind off how much I missed Chris.  It was fun.
Well, I get back home and eventually Chris catches up with me online.  Turns out she's upset at me for not being with her all weekend.  AAUGH.  What am I supposed to do?  Hey, I'm okay with her being upset with missing me, but that she wants to put all the blame on me, ugh.  It's not my fault she was stuck in her house with those fucking surveys.
Look, I'm not actually upset with her.  I'm just so ugh.  She made me regret having a good time.  I mean, now I'm really sorry for it.  I feel awful and I didn't do anything.
See there was this whole thing that Chris figured she would somehow be able to convince her mom to let her do the surveys here with me.  I don't know how she expected to pull that off.  I mean, her mom is constantly checking on her work on the surveys.  Not that Chris should be the one doing these anyway, seeing as they're her mom's project but let's not get into that.
Because I had stuff going on, it becomes my fault that this didn't work.  But don't read me wrong, I'm so sorry about it.  I should've been there for her and I was off having fun.  I'm just so frustrated, cause I didn't do anything wrong yet I did at the same time."

"event","Today was another crew call.  We got a hell of alot done.  Of course, best of all, Chris was there.  Three guys from outside of school also came.  They made us all feel a little dumb and useless, but, there was enough work to go around.  So they took care of one thing while everyone else worked on other stuff.  Since the concert is over we were able to have free reign over the stage.  So, much was built and we were able to move all the set pieces cluttering the stage out into the audience.
I gave Chris a ride home again.  Since I was goin to Aunt Jeanne and Uncle Brian's for 2 anyway, she came back to my house for half an hour.  She had a rough week, so it was good for her to relax with me for a few minutes.  I was really sorry that she couldn't stay with me.  She suggested that she do the surveys she needed to do with me, but my D&D game had already been scheduled.
So, on our way out we stopped at the Holiday Cinemas to see about me getting a job there.  I already applied there, but couldn't hurt to speak with a manager, sadly, none were there.  So, dropped Chris off at her house and headed off to my D&D game.
Upon arrival I played a little PS2 since supper preparations were in progress.  Then we went to the basement to assemble the party.  I am a Farrath named Davien, Ron is an atypical dwarven warrior with his own personal twists. Steven, Uncle Brian's cousin, is an elf constantly at ends with Ron's character.  Aunt Jeanne is a Dakari named Trisha who has taken it upon herself to be my protector.
The story goes that my sister is a very powerful sorcerer, who sends me out to gain power and follow in her footsteps.  It's important to note that as a Farrath I have blue wings growing from my shoulders.  I'm 5'5"", have hollow bones, weigh 75 pounds, look about 17, have short silver hair, a creamy complexion, and have a 9' wingspan.
My sister asked that my childhood friend, Trisha, make sure I don't get too badly hurt.  So we head off towards the capitol to join an adventurer's guild.  In the tavern of the golden swan, at the first town we're passing through we meet up with one of our guides.  He explains that he can lead us out on an adventure without a trek to the capitol.
Our conversation draws others from the tavern to our table, forming our party.  We then separate to collect supplies.  before reaching the store a small boy robs me.  The rest of my party gives chase while I fly after him.  I zap him with my electroshock spell and Steven's character grabs him.  While we try to get my money back, another thief sneaks up behind me and holds a dagger to my throat.  We let the boy go and then I zap the man with the dagger.  I get his money to replace what was stolen.  He had <strong>alot</strong> more than I.
After shopping and supper we hit up a smithy for magic equipment.  I got a cool mithril shirt light enough for me to wear and it has a mage stone!  YAY!
Seeing as Brian made up all the characters, he gave us plenty to work with.  So, I have a lot to take into account playing Davien.  His sister is overpowering, overprotective, and has always been there, so his personality has to reflect a sheltered upbringing, and I play him a little childish since this is the first time he's been given room to grow up.  Also, as a race, Farrath keep to themselves and are wary of others so I play him somewhat shy.  Still, being young and sheltered, he doesn't fear much, so he's willing to take the risks his sister doesn't want him to. <em>grin</em>
Fun fun!"

"event","BWAHAHAHA.  No task to large for me for I am <em>ULTRABASS</em>.  Don't like the name?  Meh, just trying it out.  I guess Booboo <strong>is</strong> more appropriate. (I'll explain why I was nicknamed Booboo another time) 
Ok, today was the spring concert at my school.  I sing bass 2 for concert choir, thus explaining my involvement.  Hmmm, perhaps I should describe today in chronological order... Starting towards the beginning.
Today was a b-day which means 160 minutes of Lakatos... <em>bleargh</em>.  But I got to start with religion and Mr. Killian is great.  Funny funny religion teacher.  His class on the stages of loss involved watching an episode of the Simpsons.  I believe it's called ""One Fish Two Fish Blowfish Blue Fish.""
In creative writing my sonnet was critiqued, though no time today to read the crits.  Oh, and zark me!  We finally started reading Macbeth in English, no matter that the other english classes are on act 3.
I stayed for 4th block today, even though I don't have a class, cause I needed to help Chris finish the kindness day poster.  I may think that it is entirely ridiculous to devote a day to kindness and that this whole founders' week sucks along with the dumb-ass presidents' council that organized it, but that is no excuse to have a crappie sign.  Besides, Chris asked me and I can't let her down just because presidents' council is the largest assembly of fuck-heads to curse this world with their presence.  Sign looks pretty good too, if I do say so myself.
Ok, so 7:30 today was the spring concert.  I woke in the morning with a nasty sore throat that only got worse.  I'm just lucky that it didn't effect my singing voice too much.  The concert ran till 10 and concert choir was last up.  I must say, wow.  Everyone performed so well.  Band never ceases to amaze me, and my lord we have a great string quartet.
Concert choir sung <em>Rest Sweet Nymphs</em>, <em>The Last Words of David</em>, <em>Neighbor's Chorus</em>, <em>Love Walked In</em>, <em>Blue Skies</em>, and <em>Battle Hymn for the Republic</em> in that order.  All good songs.  The first two were renaissance pieces which I have a personal fondness for and of course, who could not like <em>Battle Hymn for the Republic</em> especially when one part split the men into four parts.  Of course it was redundant to combine chorus with us for it, since the girls' part is a minor one, but it got them on stage for the applause.  So I guess it worked.
I was really glad I sing low bass cause low is easier to sing with a sore throat than high, at least for me.  The only ones I don't enjoy are the jazz pieces.  The bass part is higher than I like.  I mean, for a bass I can get high, but I enjoy singing the low notes.
So, everything went well, and the audience loved it.  If I hadn't been there I would have likely helped Chris clean her mom's office.  An inordinately annoying task seeing as her mom is an annal retentive bitch.  She takes forever to do anything and makes Chris and me take the brunt of the work.  Still, I go because I know how tough it is on Chris and I want to be there for her.  I love her so much."

"event","Yes, today was mine and Chris' 11 month anniversary.  We try to spend every anniversary together, but we have missed a few.  I think 4.  We used to try to go out every 11th, but, due to my lack of money and the pressures of school, that has not been possible the last few months.
So, we watched movies.  I think it was Fern Gully and The Point, but I have a horrid memory, especially since it wasn't the movies I was focused on.  Wait, I think Six Days, Seven Nights was one, but doesn't really matter.  We had popcorn and such.  It was good.
Though Chris was the best part.  We hung out on my bed, cuddled, enjoyed each-other's company. *dreamy sigh* The biggest problem is that she had to leave.  I really hate it when she's not around.
Oh yeah, it was Thursday, so we had supper at eight.  Chris requested hot dogs and macaroni and cheese.  Before that we played the game of life while watching a second movie, fun fun.  At 8 Friends came on so we watched that at the card table in the living room while eating.  It was a rerun though, the one with Brad Pitt.  Chris said she didn't like it cause the premise of Brad Pitt hating his wife was stupid, but after seeing it a second time she decided it was funny anyway.
All in all, the night was great.  School was kinda sucky, though, mainly cause I just wanted it to be over.  Mr. M, my art teacher, is liking my sculptures and the fact that I'm getting them in on time.  The first was a wire guy made of BX cable entitled Eegor and this one, entitled ""A Clockwork Chicken"" is a bird made of wire and yellow feathers with a clock in his chest surrounded by circuitry.  I've also started implementing the use of pentagrams <em>*devilish grin*</em>.  I love testing the tolerances of Catholic school.
My  biggest problem is that I've been getting very little sleep.  I was actually a little cranky with Chris.  I just felt like she wasn't paying very much attention to me.  She was, I was just out of it.
So, yeah, now that she's back to her home :-( I gotta do up a rough draft for my sonnet for Creative Writeing Class.  In a farewell for now fashion I will include it here, right... about...

... <strong>NOW</strong>

Oppressive glares of countless onlookers
Flock and disperse as waves of pure spite.
The crowd enslaves the few as their workers,
Heaping each task upon the last despite
My waning strength&#8217;s pleads for some small relief
From the pain of this cold, bleak existence.
Warm sweat is all the comfort for my grief
Allowed since rest has fled from my presence.
Amidst this world, loneliness holds no bounds.
Rooms full of strangers cannot satisfy
The tired slave when help must soon be found.
What shall I do when no one heeds my cry?
...  There are none but me to bear this burden.
...  I cannot allow myself to give in."

I feel bad for Chris.  I really want to help her.  The thing is, with most of her problems, all I <strong>can</strong> do is be supportive.  Only lately, I've been snapping at her.  It's just so hard to stand aside and watch her take so much abuse.  I also feel selfish, cause I don't want to do some of the things she ropes me into, so I start acting like a jerk.  I don't mean to.  I just want to help her.
Then my parents are always acting like a zarking rode block.  I mean, even when I tell them stuff ahead of time, unless I make specific plans, they just sit around on the couch.  It's not my fault I need them for so much.  I'd be out of there hair alot more if they had gotten off their asses and gotten me my license.
Every-thing's just built up so much.  Even people at school are pissing me off more with their whole ""but it all reflects back on me"" bullshit, stupid self-centered fucks.  Today was actually looking like a good day, but this has just degraded me to a moping wad of depression.  Tomorrow will be better.  A shower and some sleep will do me a world of good.

"event","What a messed up day.  I mean, it started semi-okay, well, except that I didn't sleep well, as usual.  It was even snowing this morning and most of the day, which usually puts me in a good mood.  I'm not saying I was in a bad mood all day.  Things were just blah.
Actually, the day was going okay until I got to pre-calculus.  Her test was such a piece of crap.  ugh, I'm not even gonna go into it except to say, fifty minute test my ass.  So, that pissed me off something awful.
Chris helped me to get rid of some of my anger, but there's only so much anyone can do in less than 5 minutes.  Well, my next class was concert choir.  Alot of the time that class annoys me cause there are so many self-centered pricks in it.  This is one of the few days I have something good to say about it, aside from the fact that the teacher is great and singing can be relaxing.  It's that the people in there can almost always manage to make me laugh.
Well, I was still kinda down, especially since I didn't get to see Chris between 3rd and 4th blocks.  I'm just lucky that Ramon, Nate the Fate, Tim and Carla managed to keep me laughing through lunch.  But, the thing that really sent me for a loop was the grade I got on my History test, the one I took last friday.  I mean, I was totally pissed about it.  I tried my hardest to learn that chapter, but I ran out of time and botched the essay.  Miraculously, though, I pulled off an 80, the highest grade I've gotten on a history test yet.
So, that had me really flustered.  I wasn't sure what to think.  I mean I was happy but still grumpy.  It's tough to get over all this school crap especially when so many people are just so stupid.
There again, Chris changed my mood for the better.  She was feeling lousy today, so we went to the art room and looked at each-other's art and I tried to make her feel better.  In the process, she made me feel better :-).  I love her.  Oh, and we got to hang around together till 3 cause the visions meeting we were staying late to go to got cancelled.
...  Well, after I got home I was tired.  After I woke up, not having slept of course, I started feeling kinda energetic, but the rest of my day quickly caught up with me as I was doin other stuff,  All together, it created this blah mood.
Hmmm, I was hoping to make a more fun journal, but I'm just not feeling it today.  Well, the least I can do is explain the title. 
Ok, so, I'm a senior and in concert choir, which means I have a free block which Mrs. G locked me into doing something for.  Founders week is coming up and I have to sing at the mass.  So during my free block I have to rehears with everyone else who is singing with me (it's a choir thing).  Well, it's just this one song, but like usual, the girls have problems with it.  So, Mrs. G is working with the sopranos to get through this one part and they sing this painfully high, off-pitch note.  After I cringe from the awful vibration it sent through my head I turn to Tim who's sitting next to me and say to him, ""that made my brain go ooph.""  He proceeded to write that down on his sheet music, as he is prone to do.
I just thought it would be a fitting title.  Today, on the whole, felt like that, just spread out more.  But, now it ends."

"event","It never ceases to amaze me.  Almost all of high school is composed of children.  With the exclusion of a few teachers and a handful of classmates the whole fucking building is just one big nursery for the terminally immature.  It's so zarking unbelievable.
Ok, alot of this is gonna be bitching about one particular teacher:  one Mrs. Lakatos.  Never before have I met someone so stupid.  She pulls her lessons out of her ass along with her grades.  She has no clue what the hell she's talking about.
In case you didn't know or don't remember, Lakatos teaches english AND creative writing.  The problem is she knows next to nothing in both subjects.  In english she just overanalyzes the books we read and takes so long to say anything that my class is weeks behind the other english classes taught by other teachers.  Then in creative writing, oy...  First of all her whole basis of experience was working as a copywriter for CBS.  What the fuck, she wrote advertisements.  How does that justify her teaching us how to write poetry and short stories? ugh...  On top of that her grades are based on her opinion of our work and her opinion of how capable we are.  Where does she get off giveing someone a C because, although it was excellent work, it was not up to their ability.  Fuck that, she just didn't like it.
So many other teachers are like this too.  They're just incapable of teaching, so they say whatever the hell comes to mind to cover their asses.  And I haven't even started in on the students.  The ones that aren't simply assholes to impress their friends are zarking premadannos that make every single damn thing into a popularity contest.
I mean, most of the time I can ignore this kind of crap.  In fact, it spites all those bastards just to not fall for their stupid popularity shit.  Telling them off is so fun, pisses them off to no end too.  The problem is that, unlike me, Chris cares what people think.  I mean, I can't blame her, sometimes people's opinions can be a really big deal.  The real problem is that these losers feel that since I'm dating Chris, everything I say or do reflects on her.  That's just crap, makes me worry even more about her than I already do.
Another interesting thing is that I go to Catholic school.  The thing is that I, not to toot my own horn, am an extraordinarily open minded Catholic.  I can only get away with saying that cause so many of my religious brethren are naive, closed minded, and sheltered to the point that they don't even understand their own religion apart from what school tells them.  Many are also very opinionated which is freakin annoying but survivable.  Like I was commenting to a friend of mine the other day, it can be very humorous.  I mean, I can get away with wearing my tool hoody to school, as long as I don't wear it to class, even though on the back there is a penis shaped wrench.  Most of them just don't get the phallic reference. bwahahaha.  I love it

Here's a shock of a life time: I actually slept well last night. That <strong>never</strong> happens.  I haven't even had a restful sleep in over 2 weeks.  It just feels like such a fucking waste of time to wake up tired.  I mean, I might as-well give up sleep if I'm gonna be tired all the time anyway.
I've been having some real fucked up, freaky dreams lately, too.  I started keeping a dream journal to try to figure out the cause of my nightmares, but I so rarely remember my dreams/have time to write them down that there are only 2 entries after a few weeks.  If I remember I'll start posting my dreams here *points to the computer*.
Anyway, Chris got here shortly after 11.  We got to work around 12. (She did a report on Harold Ramis for her film class.  I was quite capable of helping since I took the same course last semester and got an A on this same project, except my report was on David Fincher.)  I had to redo the film clips I made for her on friday, cause they didn't record the first time, oy.
Well, we finished around 7:30, and it came out great.  After that we finally got to be alone.  Wow, she makes me feel so good.  The details don't matter.  I'm just glad I had that hour with her.  She makes the world seem right.
Ugh, I'd write more, but I'm totally drained.  So, now is time for sleep.

"event","Today was a surprisingly good day.  Although I shouldn't be so surprised, I mean I got to see Chris.  I always feel good when she's around.  Of course that might just have something to do with the fact that I love her, but who knows.
	Today was also the second crew call for <em>The Wiz</em> , which is why I got to see Chris.  Yeah, my school is putting on <em>The Wiz</em> as the spring musical.  I could have been in the ensemble but I'm having more fun on crew, which is quite contrary to my freshman experience.  We (those of us on crew) moved some stuff around, built a few things, and such but there really wasn't much to do since the stage, for now, has to remain clear.  The reason for this is the concert coming up on friday.  I happen to be singing in the choir in that concert, but other than that it really doesn't concern me.
	...But, I digress.  My mom couldn't pick me up till 12:30 even though crew let out at 12. (I need my fucking license.  I must remember to make the test appointment).  I'm just glad it was rainy.  I like hanging around in the rain, it feels nice and has an overall positive effect on my mood (two thumbs up to the rain).  To make it even better, Chris was getting a ride with me so I got to hang around in the rain with her, YAY! (A nice janitor guy even let us stay in the foyer of the school for a while!)
	From there I went to put in a job app at a cinema near my house. (I need some fucking money.)  Then, we got some sandwiches at the Stop&Shop which we ate on the way to drop Chris off at her house. (It was sad to see her leave.)  
	Her  mom is such a pain in the ass.  My lord, she puts Chris through so much crap.    I can't even do anything about it, GAH!  I mean, she treats Chris like total shit, but as soon as she gets the least bit emotional, she expects Chris to be some fucking fountain of sympathy.  Fuck that, kindness begets kindness.  Still, Chris does give her sympathy and it's not fucking right.  I hate to be selfish, but it's not fair to me either.  I'm the one who has to be there for Chris all the time because her mom is such a bitch, while her mom doesn't even realize anything is wrong.  It's such fucking crap.
	Still, nothing for me to do, but be supportive.  So anyway...  I went to my Aunt Jeanne and Uncle Brian's house afterwards.  I helped moved furniture around.  Then, me and Brian played video games for a while. (Dynasty Warrior 4 is an absolutely <strong>SICK</strong> game!)  After supper and cards I went home, but hey, I got something to look forward to tomorrow. (see next paragraph)  Not to mention, I'm totally psyched about the Dungeons & Dragons game I'll be playing in just 1 week. BWAHAHAHA
	Chris is coming over to work on a project.  Should be fun.  Besides, who knows what we'll do when we're done.  *grin*  With that, I do conclude that this has been a good day... right... later."

"event","<P>Guess I'll ""update"" this. For two reasons. 1. I'm bored, 2. I'm just insane and have nothing better to do lol. Alright so today was pretty boring as the usual school days are. Had a test in history,did nothing in creative writing,lol,communications,..yeahhh Mr. Tate's a big butt,lol he gave us a crap load of hw that's due Wednesday I believe..because we have to take some dumb ""terra nova"" test that we shouldn't even have had to take but Dr. Wunder's a dumb butt lol. So looks like I'll most likely be getting remediation for math.. blah..(yeah Jordan you suck lol) So anyways,Spanish we did the usual,it was boring I just kinda laid there with my head down lol,just zoning out as usual. Ummm I was kind of giggly and I bet annoying today lol because I was tired and sleepy. By the time I got INTO bed last night it was 12:40 lol..so then I kept getting hot and cold hot and cold,so I would open my window,shut my window and so on and so forth. Then I was&nbsp;like flipping out lol...so I kept waking up and couldn't get to sleep. I woke up at like 4:03 then 5,then my alarm went off at 6 lol I just laid there,I was so tired. I could barely open my eyes. I think I finally got up at 6:30 I don't even know...who cares. So practice I worked on hurdles,and felt sick after a full flight,but I did 3 full flights then a half one at the end because I stopped early because I was going to spu everywhere lol or so it felt like it. Plus I had to put/get all the hurdles away anyways. And as usual Hummle didn't help me worth crap,but OH WELL.</P>
<P>After track I went home didn't do much,then went off to soccer. Still felt sick in the stomach..after a bit it felt better,we scrimmaged as usual,that was fun,lol except for that Cody kid gets on my nerves,but I actually didn't mess up a whole lot today at practice lol just a few times..&amp; he wasn't THAT annoying but still annoying,lol Macy just kills him haha practice was real hilarious tonight. Macy just cracked me up real bad...soo after practice I went to find my brother(he was there too practicing on another field.) So then I had to wait for him to be done. They were scrimmaging also. So then we came home,I showered and stuff because I was real gross lol and now I'm online talking to Jordan because he's crazy cool lol...so that was/is pretty much my day,yeah real boring,but ohh well this occupied some of MY time lol..cya</P>"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Hello. ..lol not a whole lot has gone on this weekend. Just the usual stuff. I changed this thing around a bit,to make it more summerish. ;) [yaay it's almost summer!] The weather we keep having right now is so great,I hope it stays this way. Speaking of almost's,it's almost my birthday. :) That makes me happy..I guess,lol. It's just kind of exciting I suppose. I think once my birthday comes it'll really feel like school's over,because my birthday's May-then there's June..so yeah..that's fun. But I can't believe school's over in like 7 weeks...I think it was that Stef and I counted lol. That's crazy..a year at the high school already. Geez. Seems like yesterday when I was sitting in Loth's homeroom or in Loth's science class first period[haha,I seriously do miss that women though,she was so funny,(and half the time she didn't even try to be)] She was just weird I think,lol but hey she always made me laugh. So tomorrow's back to school for another week..mm not real excited for that lol. But tomorrow I do have soccer practice again :))) YAAY. And I'm thinking this weekend comming is our first game,so that's just awesome. Also tomorrow's back to track practice,lol which isn't THAT bad I guess. I need[as always] to work on those hurdles...I'm determined to get those stupid things down to a TEE. ..even IF I have to do it myself lol [because Hummle's never there,but he never helps us that much anyway],oh well. So that's about all that's going to go down tomorrow..lol: School,practice,practice. Woo hoo! lol.. Oh yeah I think our next meet is this comming Thursday. It's our first home meet,girls only. Well I guess that's about it,cya later.</P>
<P>[P.S} Can you tell I have nothing better to do than mess around/update this dumb thing? lol [exactly]..:) well cya</P>"

"event","<P>Alright. So continuing where my last entry was. Our meet was the next day(the 13th,Wednesday). It was at Somerset-against Richland &amp; Somerset. Richland killed us,and Somerset we lost to them by 6 points. It was nice weather,but everyone was just sick and all this other crap. I don't know. So the 100 I actually (and finally) got my time-trail time. So I was just sort of happy about that because I was starting to think that for time trials someone messed up my time,because I was getting 15:8 and 15:9, but Wednesday I got 15:3. something so it rounded to 15:4,but my trial time was 15:3,so now I just have to make ThAT LOWer,lol which will be hard and which&nbsp; I probably won't be able to do,but oh well I guess I'll try. So hurdles I was the only one,because Chelsea's insane in other events and she was sick all week,and she's always tired anyway. So I was the only 300 hurdler for our team. lol. Which wasn't good on my nerves at all. So then to make it worse,Coach Conlon comes over and he's like,""you're my only one today,so go hard"" well THANKS that makes me feel a shitload better,let me tell you. I already KNEW that I was the only one,and I also knew I had to go hard,whoever thinks they don't have to go hard is retarded. So I have to go the first heat,the fast one. WELL. I was HOPEING to get maybe 54 something,or at least better than my best time,which is like a 57 something. Well, first of all,I messed up my start so bad. Second of all,I jumped when the gun went off,thenn I guess I was just running slow,I have no idea. But I got like 58 or something and I was so mad. I honestly can't deal with hurdles. They piss me off so bad and make me so emotional that my eyes start watering and I start crying. And I don't care if I look like a big baby or not,I can't help it. I just get so pissed off and frustrated that my eyes just start going insane.</P>
<P>I should have beaten at least 2 of those girls and I didn't beat any of them. It sucked. Then later I found out that the dumb ass people who set up hurdles completely forgot one,in all the lanes. and I STILL got a sucky ass time. So that made me look even worse than I did. (and for the record I was wondering where the other hurdle was when we were at the start) but figured I just couldn't see it,plus I just forgot about it because I was like flipping out. ..well that's how that was. and I was pissed,and still am pissed at myself. I know I should have done A LOT better,and I don't know why I didn't. Oh well I guess. That meet's over and done with I guess. I got 6th,lolol,so I guess at least I placed. But I prob. should have gotten 4th or 3rd. OH WELL. maybe it was just a bad day...so anyway..I go back over to take my spikes off,so i just like sit/lay there freaking ready to shoot myself. Then Chelsea and Christy come over,lol dorks. (thanks though girls). so then I finalyl go back over,then I just lay there and get pissed off again and i start sobbing/crying again. then I'm laying there with my head down,Coach comes over,""Eger you should have had your best time today."" THANKS COACH I THINK I KNOW THAT. I'm like crying and killing myself and he says dumb shit like that. It's like I FReaKING KNOW. I dunno it was just a bad day. </P>
<P>Yesterday was a bad day as well. Not a whole lot went on. But&nbsp; I was in a bad mood at practice,and the coaches made it even worse. And we only had until 4:30 and it' slike geez give us a freakin break,our meet was just yesterday. So anyway,we do the usual.We tried to get away with one lap-they made us do 2. Stretch,2 more. Then they made us runt eh XC course,which I might not have minded,but like I said,I was mad and in a bad mood yesterday. So Heidi,Alisha,Chelsea and me ran it,and I guess everyone was back behind us,but the times we looked back we didn't see anyone,? So I dunno what happened. So when we get done with it,we go into the school to get a drink and such. And we find out Jeri like rolled her ankle,I dunno what the whole story is,lol,but I hope you're okay Jeri. :) So after all that,we went back up to the track-and my left leg was being all weird,my shin hurt but mostly my quad or w/e it is was like pulling an feeling real weird,i dunno so i was trying to stretch that out-so anyway,we stretched,then I talked to Coach Hummle for a tid bit,lol which he was mad at me,at least I think,for my bad time. And i told him that I ccan't handle hurdles because they make me so mad...but I was like I'll do them,I'm just telling you,they make me mad lol..so he was like alright...anyway so after that I pretty much left.</P>
<P>Came home did nothing I think. Showered,ate,watched TV,the OC was on. :),then watched more tv,fell asleep at like 10:30 on the chair,watching the news,I guess Josh came home,I think he woke me up,I don't remember,woke up,took my contacts out,couldn't get the left one out,and when I did it burned real bad,(still does)so then my brother comes back to my room,shows me the pics. he took of me at.....NOrthern Bedford meet.(our 1st meet) of me doing hurdles. lol. they're pretty crazy looking. The one I'm like way above the hurdle. I hope I'm not like that now. lol so anyway,after that I went to bed. I was tired. So this morning Tim barges in my room at like 8 and wakes me up,I try to open my eyes,my left eye's like all blurry and burns real bad,so I like shut it quick lol,then I just like lay there in pain. Got up again later at 10,now i'm doing absoltly nothing. I have the urge to watch Forest Gump,so I think I'll probably do that,maybe go running later on,who knows. Well that's all for now I guess-this is really really long lol,so if you read it all I'm proud of you. ..lol later</P>"

EDIT: So I decided time for a real update(now that I've sort of calmed down and everything,lol)Long story about the hurdles,I don't want to talk about it. I'm so fed up with them though....anyways. Today was dumb as usual. Nothing that great happened. I think I laughed a lot today,maybe,I dunno. I have a test in History tomorrow(fun fun,not)..so I have to study for that and stuff. Tomorrow's also girls meet. But we get out at 1,(yay!) That makes me a little bit more thankful,but not really,because I still have to do hurdles. Anywho. Yesterday,had track as usual,we did intervals,I really dislike those,we had to do them for XC but they were mile intervals,and the stuff we did wasn't TOO BAD,lol but pretty beastly after not doing intervals for a long time. So the day I have soccer practice,I'm so excited and everything,then we do intervals for track,geez. So after track my brother was there to pick me up..he took me to Macy's,left Macy's,went out to NB because her little sister had practice & her mom's one of the coaches. So we just ""occupied"" ourselves for like an hour lol.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--So finally people started showing up,but I got nervous,because I'm shy around new people. lol...so when everyone was there we stretched for like 2 seconds lol,then we pciked teams or whatever and scrimmaged the whole time. (That equals me killing my shin,yeah not too fun) but I kept running and crap anyways. So that was fun except for this one kid who's really cocky and I hate him already,lol. Macy just like kills him. It was so hilarous. And I ran into him the one time-lol Me & Macy just like,take him and all the other guys on. ;) Because ""we're tough Central girls"" lol and ""we have more integrity to kick your ass because WE don't even HAVE a SOCCER!"" lol Macy I don't think I used the word integrity the right way in that sentance,but it's all good. So after soccer my whole left leg was death. So I came home and iced it. I was really tired when I got home. Showered,got online,then pretty much went to bed. It seemed like it was really late,but it wasn't really. It was only about 11,11:30.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I woke up around 3,and felt like I was going to be sick. So I like run to the bathroom and throw up a little bit,go to the bathroom,lol..that's gross,but that's what happened. Then I tried to go back to sleep and I still felt sick,and my stomach kept making weird noises at me,and also did that in the morning. Felt like crap this morning..was tired as usual. Wellll...today,had track,and as you know got pissed/am pissed at hurdles..but just mainly at myself because I can't freakin do them..or hit that mark,whatever. They make me so angry and frustrated. UGH! whatever,hopefully I won't stop or do whatever at tomorrow's meet,because I'm dumb like that and probably will. ..well whatever..I guess that's good enough--------bye for now.

"event","<P>So Johnstown-geez. lol. I was pissed @ my 100 time. I only went down like a second. And I can't figure out how I got a 15:3 in time trials and my meet times suck ass. I dunno,I pisses me off though. Yeah I suck,but not that bad..I dunno or maybe I do? Who knows. So I always screwed up my hurdles really bad too. The one,I just like,stopped,I don't know what I did or how I did it,but I messed up. I was so pissed. My time went down to like a 59 something,lol not that good,but better than first meet. And if I wouldn't have messed up&nbsp; I probably would have been better,oh well. But I was really pissed at myself about those hurdles. I was just so pissed and mad,upset,whatever. So our sprint events were horrible against J-town,lol but our distance people killed. So anyways we beat Connemaul township or whoever the other team was that was there,I don't remember..? sorry. &amp; Johnstown we lost to them by a POINT! ..oh well. We still did good. lol I kept killing myself about those hurdles,I still am. then Chelsea waslike I'm going to HIT you lol,oh well. So then yesterday we had an Invite. That means my Saturday was like another school day. I got up at 6:30 and get ready. Got to the school early[like I wanted to] then some people showed up within 10 mins or so. We left,I slept on the way. </P>
<P>I was nervous the whole time for hurdles. I kept freaking out and stretching lol. And doing all this stuff. Even on our two warm-up laps everytime I saw the little arrows I would jump and do my movements &amp; think ""HURDLE!"" lol. So after a long time,finally 300 hurdles came and I was so nervous I was ready to pee myself[which I didn't know if i really had to pee or if I was just nervous.] But I couldn't go pee anyway,I didn't have time. So I almost peed and puke everywhere because I really nervous lol. So anyways. I had the same lady doing my start as the one that yelled at me earlier[lmao too funny,she was a beotch..long story] so anywho. After she finally shot the dumb gun we were off,and I did good. Except I think I pulled my left arm back too hard on all of them and so that makes your body twist,and that makes your landing off. And I kept landing in the other lane..opps. And everytime I kept thinking,SHIT,lol because you'll get DQ'ed for that. So anyways,I did lower my time a bit,so that made me real happy. And I got over all the hurdles and everything. I got burnt from the sun really bad lol,so did a lot of other people though,haha we all have farmer tans. How cool is that? lol....so anywho---Come tomomarrow I'm going to kill myself to fix what I did wrong. &amp; Tomorrow's Soccer practice[for REAL this time] buttheads,lol. So I can't WAIT for that. I'm SO freakin excited!..well this is beastly long-so cya later. &lt;3 </P>"

"event","<P>So as usual. Today was a boring day..again. And I was pretty tired,again, as usual lol. This morning I woke up at like 6:59 lol so I had like 10 mins to get ready,oh well. So I wore some baggy sweater lol[it was baggy because its my brother's lol] &amp; I probably looked like crap,but oh well. :) So anywho. I woke up and the first thing I said when I saw the clock was, ""Oh shit.!"" lol so I get up and get ready quickly. So then It was like 7:10 and I was like, ""shit I didn't put in my eye-drops"" [which I have to put them in when I get up because supposively 'my eyes have allergies' and the thing said to wait 15 mins before you put the contacts in,and if I don't put my drops in my left eye burns like a beast..] ANYWAY. So I was like FREAK. So then I was like screw that I'm not putting my contacts in because it's going to kill my left eye. So I just put the case in my bookbag,&amp; also,I figured I'd sleep during 2nd/3rd lunch anyway,or keep falling asleep in Tate's[like I have been for the last couple days]---So then I went down to the bus...yeah yeah that whole usual stuff. Got to school-was normal as always. Did stuff that I don't feel like talkin about and you guys don't wanna read,but I guess you're probably reading this anyway because you get really bored like I do..lol oh geez I keep going off topic real bad in this so-called 'entry.' </P>
<P><STRONG>So ANYWAY </STRONG>after school the girls had practice-guys had their meet in Johnstown. Practice was easy--it was premeet. .&amp; was only til 4:30, as usual. So we did the usual things, then we split off to do whatever we needed to. So of COURSE I went and got hurdles..and worked on them. I did 2 full-flights and 2 half flights. By this time my leg was killing me,but I just have to run through that dumb shin splint..but hurdles especially don't help-because you land and put like all your weight on one leg and so on..and especialyl if I hit my left trail leg off the dumb hurdle,[which I did alot of today lol] that hurts real bad. BUT OH WELL! lol....so after that I pretty much laid there in the grass,my leg was quite PAINFUL..blah. It was nice out today,but rather hot..oh well again. Geez I really need to stop complaining..but actually I don't complain that much lol,just voicing my opinion. So anyways-like I said today was pre-meet,that means [obviously] that tomarrow we have a meet...we get out of school at 1:10 {YAAAay} lol. That's always fun. Too baad that I have to miss Leonard's Spanish class[not]. ..so meet tomorrow and then meet Saturday morning-GEEZ. lol..naah it shouldn't be THAT bad. I just wish my leg wouldn't kill me,so then I could work on hurdles A LOT more. But I guess the pain makes me want to do those hurdles and do them right even more. Even if my leg falls off lol,I'll STILL keep running those beasts...anywho so I guess that's about it. I just got out of the shower a bit ago..&amp; I'm washing my uniform and stuff for tomarrow. ..now I'm waiting for the dryer to be done so I can pack my bag and everything early-[planning on going to bed early tonight,HOPEFULLY lol] well I gotta go dry my hair-later.</P>"

So Macy just tells me that we might have to end up having practices out by her house..because NB is so effin gay! And supposivley they said we can't use the fields because it's PSSA week. WTF Does PSSA have to do with the FIELDS??? What a bunch of faggots. I'm so pissed off. It's not like they're going to sit in desks on the freakin fields and take the PSSA test. What the hell. That's a load of cow shit. They don't even need the fields,they just don't want us to use it. That's CRAP.Ew that pisses me off so bad. I figured NB would be 20 million times better than H-burg ayso soccer because for H-burg they only had 2 teams in my division. [counting my team,my team and another team] So every Saturday we played the same team..and half the time we had to give THEM players because a bunch of dumb asses signed up for soccer at their school and for ayso,so then they didn't play ayso,just for the school. So that was gay. And our practices were really dumb also...ugh whatever. People are so freakin gay...wait until i FINALLY get to play a game.I'll have so much freakin energy and steam inside me.I'l just freakin flip out during the game lol. I'll just go insane,freakin running everywhere and shit.....freakin people..whatever..maybe it'll be better whenever we finally get this all figured out and we actually can HAVE a practice.....UGH lol. I'm so freaking mad that I don't even know what to say....</P>
<P>well to change the subject,today was pretty dumb. I was tired. lol but long story short Chelsea is Dances With Hurdles,and I'm Tanglefoot..I think that's what it is? Tanglefoot or something lolol and then in Creative writing I wrote a story about us,and we were Indians and went on a buffalo hunt..lol to get food for our Husbands. Sprinting Spirit and Running Turtle..lmao that was funny..lolol. anyways,the rest of the day was pretty dumb..then practice the usual,then me and Chelsea worked on hurdles,and my leg was killing me,but oh well....i kept going anyway. Then i didn't even say anything and coach made me go get ice..blaah I really wanted to do Indian runs but Coach made me go get ice..dumb butt..lol..oh well. So toamrrow's the guys' meet,and we have pre-meet. So tomarrow I'll be working on hurdles and stuff as usual. Hopefully me and Chels will get some full flights in this time-haha..welp this is enough for now-and I'm still pretty pissed off..lol so cya</P>"

"event","<P>..not in a good mood at all. well okay. first of all. i was all excited and hyped up because we were ""SUPPOSED"" to have soccer practice tomarrow. So Macy walks in homeroom this morning and tells me all this stuff about ""NB needs their field now."" and it's like WHAT THE HELL. that's gay. And why can't we use the old field? that's f;in gay. I was so pissed off I swear I almost cried when she told me. Well that just pretty much ruined my whole day...but I guess I got over it,I dunno. Besides that it was a pretty normal day. I just wanted to go to track practice and work on hurdles. Well, 1. we didn't even do hurdles,but I did decide to do the 500 crunches,then we went on a run through town[one of my favorites from XC,because I miss it],then we came back and did hills and all that stuff. So it was a pretty good work out..anywho. Then my brother was waiting for me,came home..sat around. My brother's gf was here. So I watched tv and they were printing some thing out for college. So then all hell breaks loose over nothing and she just liek runs out the door crying,and I'm like holy F what in the world's going on. Because my brother was just joking around and believe me,it was NOTHING that ANYONE would have took literally. He was just like-yeah,what are you on today? [just because she was being goofy as usual,and she was sort of like-hyped up lol] So then who knows what,they go insane. Then come back and I'm like GEEZ. So I'm like flipping out already because I can't deal with it when people are like that ..</P>

edit: I had some other stuff in here of why I'm mad or whatever,but I decided to take it out..yeah...soo whatever I hope tomarrow's better-but then again it probably won't be because I'll know the whole day that i SHOULD HAVE HAD soccer practice..and that will just piss me off within itself..well bye ig uess"

I did 'okay' in my events,actually I think and would say I did pretty bad,but I'm trying to think more 'positive' lol and I did better than I thought I would. So anyway.. for the <STRONG>100: </STRONG>I ran the slow heat because obviously,there were faster people than me on our team. lol I got 2nd in my heat with a 15:9,that's horrible,because time trials I got a 15:3 and was hoping I'd at least get a 14 something...oh well that sucks. But at least I wasn't last in my heat[like I figured I'd be]. <STRONG>300 Hurdles:</STRONG> Also ran the slow heat because I told Chelsea she was running the fast heat because she's faster than me without hurdles lol. So she did,and of course she did good in hurdles and everything else she was in. Then I went the 2nd heat,[me and chels are the only people running 300 hurdles lol..] so I went and I was nervous as crap that I'd stop or trip or whatever possible. So then we were off,and I made it over all the hurdles and didn't fall,but I'm pretty sure I stutter-stepped a bit,and my form was off. :-/ blaah. But I got 2nd in that heat too,[again,I thought I'd be the last one behind everyone,lol but I wasn't.] and I think if my form would have been better than I would have beat the girl infront of me and had a better time,I don't know,I really really need to work on those hurdles,and get them down. So my time for 300 hurdles was 1:01,which is really horrible again,..but I'm going to get it down if it kills me....so anyways,nothing really else. I was really tired friday for school and I had a test in every class except creative writing. blah.</P>
<P>Practice,we did the usual stuff,then I went with sprinters and we did some little thing that was fun and easy,then we went our separate ways and I went and worked on hurdles. Which I kept messing them up. If I didn't stutter-step the first one,then I did it on the second one. I was getting very mad and frustrated at myself. and my dumb leg wasn't helping. my shin was killing me with really sharp pains and my calf was hurting as well..oh well I kept working because I neeeeeeed desperately to get those DUMB hurdles down to a tee...which hopefully I can do. For next meet my goal's just to get a better time,better than 1:01 and better than 15:9 lol,I know I can do better than 15:9 though because time trials I got a 15:3 for the 100. and that's bad,but hopefully I can break somewhere in the 14's even if it's only 14:9 then I'll be happy. But whatever,I guess all I can do is try my hardest. So practice was only til 4:30 because it was after a meet I guess,and usually practice on Friday's are shorter than usual..soo went home,ate,iced my leg,showered,laid around or something,watched tv,I don't even remember. I probably didn't do too much. Last night I went to bed at like 12-12:30,[that's relaly early for me regularly and especially on the weekend.] but i was really tired like I said all day,so I just went to sleep,I could barely keep my eyes open. lol. So this morning I read the paper and read our article from the meet and other people's meets to look at times...I have A LOT of work to do,that's for SURE. I'm really really pushing myself..I duno I just hope I can meet my goals,let alone the goals coaches probably have for me lol,which probably aren't too high themselves for how slow I am,but oh well..like I said,I'm just going to try with all my might and all my heart...well this is long enough,I really get to talking about this crap when I get into it lol..</P>
<P>oh yeah,also Soccer starts Tuesday! I'm so excited! :D lol that's all i have to say I guess..well cya. &lt;3</P>"

"event","<P>Okay-well today was the usual,school and all that dumb crap. [Today was the last day we had to dress for gym class (Yay!) lol]..anyway,so then I had practice after school of course. Coach Hummle was actually THERE today. lol So I had a coach! yay. lol but I was still bad at hurdles lolol We had to do our regualar,reuteen[not spelled right lol but it's okay] trail drills,yeah,me,doing those for 100 hurdles,HURTS the hip like a beast. I was like ow,ow,ow,ow,ow,ow,ow times 1million lol. Then we started jumping and stuff-yeah killer on my legs. I don't know what's wrong with them. My calves hurt more than my shin splints do-blaah. Oh well. I just kept going and going,hurdle after dumb hurdle lol,over and over. And I'm still bad. I'm going to probably mess them up on the meet Thursday-which is only a day away because tomarrow's Wednesday[as you all know this lol] But I don't care. At least I'm trying. There's noone else in hurdles,only a couple people,so poop on the rest of you if you make fun of me,because I don't really give a crap,I'd like to see you do them! lol. So anyways,we practiced jumping and stuff. The only problems I have [which are pretty major problems if you ask me] lol are that I get too close to the hurdle when going over[because my 'momentum's going to 'fly' me over the hurdle'' lol. Hummle's on crack. But oh well. I keep trying to perfect that. And also whenever I jump after my trail leg comes over I snap my arm too quick,so then my chest and stuff turns when I go to land,and then I land aquard,yeah however that's spelled. ..and landing crooked messes up my time[if I ever get a time lol] and everything else...sooo after all that crap I couldn't do any more because my leg's hurt really bad,so Hummle was like alright you're done after this set ,and I was like okay. So after that I went to work on comming out of blocks. </P>
<P>So after practice my brother was outside to pick me up. We came home,sat around for a little bit. Then we went in town so I could get the right spikes lol. Well,the ones I saw online that I wanted weren't at the one store,which was weird,but it's the internet,so what do you expect I guess. So after that we went back to Dunham's[where&nbsp;I got my spikes to begin with.] and we looked around,so then I got these blue asisics that like 2 people already have on the team,but those were like the only ones lol..oh well I don't care. I like them,and they're a sprinter shoe/spike. So it works. So we tried one on,lol and they only had like a 7 1/2,so I was like alright,so I tried it on,and that works I guess. lol. I wear a 6 by the way,lol oh well. So then we got those,exchanged the other ones,and then we left. My brother went to Walmart for crap,then we left,came home,and then I ate,got on here,and now I'm sort of bored. But I think I'm going to go soon and get my bag packed for practice tomarrow[get picked out what I wanna wear],then get a shower,mess around with my dumb hair,thennnn,I don't know. Maybe do laundry,oh yeah I have to read a lesson in History for Chonko..oh yeah and while I'm taking that shower I need to shave-lol...ummm that's about it,but that'll take me forever. Sooo oh well. I guess I'll end this because it's long and I tried to make it short, lol oh well. Cya tomarrow I guess..or whenever. ;) later.</P>
<P>P.S: I also get to get out of school tomarrow at 1,well before one because my eye appointment's at 1:15,so make that maybe------12:30? ..maybe that's when my dad will come get me,and by the time we got to R.S and to the eye lady it should be 1:15,whooo knows. But I shall be back for practice of course. :) Yeah my dad's gonna love that,lol picking me up,running me back to Roaring Spring,then back to school for practice,then picking me up around at 5,heading back to our homestead in R.S..yeah he'll love that. lol But I'm beting he'll send Josh or Tim after me . :) Well okay,goodbye lol.</P>"

"event","<P>..Practice was cancelled today,I was disappointed,I couldn't sleep last night because I kept practing those hurdles over and over and over again in my head,lol. ..so after we drove to the school and Coach said practice was cancelled,my dad yelled around of course,then we came home and he went to sleep,and I read the paper,then went back to sleep as well. I woke up ..around 1 maybe? I don't remember. Let my dad sleep,but knew I needed to get spikes,around 3:30 we went into Dunham's to get spikes,well first off they didn't have my size in woman's,lol they were only like 7 and up,and I wear a 6. So then they had some on this rack or whatever but they still didn't have my size. So then my dad's like just look at the men's. So we did that,then I ended up getting a 7 in men's anyway because the 6 was a little tight on my foot. So we bought them,which I felt hesitant about in the first place. Well,I got home,showed my brother and he was like 'those aren't sprinter spikes you goof' and I was like yeah they are,when I sort of knew they weren't,or figured he was right. lol. Supposivley they're cross country spikes...soo again,supposivley I'm taking those back tomarrow-and we're going to go check Supershoe out because they have an awesome sprinter spike that I saw online,and ,once AGAIN,supposivley they sell them there,or they should. So let's hope the spikes I want are there,and are available,whatever.</P>
<P>&nbsp;So the rest of the day I didn't really do anything. Just sat around and wished we would have had practice. Got online,ate some candy,lol so on and so forth. Now I'm sitting here,again,doing laundry and crap like that. I want to go to practice,[the reason why my mood's excited] lol. I can't wait til tomarrow after school,and now that I say that we'll probably do something beastly,either that or nothing at all[nothing at all,or not much because of this dumb weather] but then again,it's 'supposed' to be 50 some out tomarrow,but it was 50 something today and it was raining all day. So who knows. Our weather's totally wacked out. So tomarrow at practice I have to wear my spikes I got from the school during cross country[because my dad wouldn't buy any]for now until I get spikes. I'm thinking I'll just keep the ones I got from the school for cross country-and of course when c.c rolls around next fall I'll get the bigger spikes from coach. And then the spikes I'm getting now will/are going to be sprinter spikes,for Track obviously. Who knows. Hopefully all goes well. But if all fails,I'll be wearing the spikes I wore for c.c in our meet Thursday..ohhhhhh well. I'm not fussing over my spikes,who cares,whatever I have to run in,then I'll run in them. ..oh yeah,tomarrow's back to school,but oh well,who really cares,not me lol. I just want to go to practice,well this is long as always,so I'll end it. Cya tomarrow everyone.</P>"

"event","<P>Blaah. Nothing to do. Just got back from Walmart,I thought we were going to the mall,but my dad was like we'll go in Monday morning [since he gets off work at 7 a.m,and I don't have school] to get my spikes for track and do whatever else. Hopefully also Monday I can get my hair cut,yaay lol. So I didn't really do anything today. I wanted to get my hair cut,but my mom had work at 2,and I usually never go to get my hair cut with my dad,lol,so I didn't get to,and like I said,I thought we were maybe going to buy spikes at Dunham's but,we didn't. My dad just got a 'plant light' for his plants...and I got bobby pins lol,that's about it,oh yeah and some candy for Easter. </P>
<P>Speaking of which I can't believe tomarrow's Easter. Probably because Easter's usually in April and it's in March,yeaah. lol. So Happy early Easter everyone-lol..umm I don't know what else to write in here,no school Monday,ummm,oh yeah. Our first meet's Thursday,and I don't think I'll be ready for it-lol,as in I won't be all that great in the event,or events I do,which I don't even know what those are. But right now it's looking like I'm going to do some form of hurdles,and I don't know of anything else,because coach didn't say anything to me,he's worried about all the talented people-lol,the relay people and stuff like that,but ohhhhhh well. I guess it would help if I had a coach,and Hummle's not there because he just had a kid or whatever,so I never have a coach when I work on hurdles,but oh well...I guess that's it because I can't think of anything else. goodbye. &lt;3</P>"

"event","<P>..woke up this morning at 9:03,saw that on my clock,jumped out of bed-and went ""oh SHIT"",ran out,my dad was just comming in the door,""DAD I'M LATE FOR PRACTICE!"" welll,let's just say my dad started yelling at me-then called the eye doctor[they opened at 8:20] and he was supposed to call waaaay before 9,soo I think what happened was,I set my alarm too early,I set it for like 7 or something,I don't even remember,because I wanted to get up and shower and everything. Well,I think it went off,and then I obviously turned it off,and then noticed it was only like 7:15,so then me,being dumb,fell back asleep. So anyways,my dad's like on the phone with the eye lady,.and I'm like back trying to get all my shit on,and he's like they can squeeze you in at 10:30 and I'm like ""DAD that's when practice is OVER!"" lol &amp; I was pissed because I was already late..and by this time it's like 9:10 or so,so he was like-I guess you'll have to reschudule because she's already late for practice,so then the lady's like gabbing on the phone,and i'm like i need to leeeave.lol-soI don't even remember what time I finally got to the school,ran up to the track,again,didn't have a coach because Coach Conlon was working with relay people,and Mr. Snare was just around somewhere,so I was like I guess I'll go do hurdles. Hope already had them set up,and I just jumped the little starter ones and it killed my leg,so then I was like I'm real dumb because I didn't stretch. So then I stretched some,and it was still killer. So then I decided to go over and work on the 300&nbsp; hurdles because I""m probably doing those ones,the 100 hurdles are too tall for me lol,well I'm too small for them...and everytime I did them they killed,but I kept doing it anyway,I don't care how bad it hurts,I""m working on it,and getting it right...so I did that a couple times,til I couldn't anymore. Then I went over and decided to practice 100 hurdles since they were setup already...yeah lol I kept wussing out because they're real scary,lol I can barely make it over those ones..and by this time everyone was watching me-lol,so I got even more nervous. Then I finally did it and about killed myself and my left leg..I think I just have a shin split really bad on my left leg-but it's in my calf really bad too,so who freaking knows. But my leg was pissing me off because I needed to work on 300 hurdles but everytime I did them I came back limping and my leg was killing me and stuff,.....oh well-so then me and Chelsea did Indian runs with the distance people,but we only did like half a mile,so we did the Indian runs all crazy..I shouldn't have even done those lol espeically after ""trying"" to do the 100 hurdles because they're real beastly,but I did anyway,then after that we all went down and sat and waited for our rides.</P>
<P>On further note I have to go to the eye doctor the 30th,and that's like the day before my meet..and I believe I have to get out of school at like 8ish to go,and then come back...or whatever I do..and probably,like my dad said,by that time my eye will be healing up again,like it did before,but then it came back two weeks later-who knows,my eye's so screwed up lol,I think the left side of my body's all messed up-my eye,and now my leg,but my right leg's starting to get a splint now too I believe,oh well,..now I'm sitting here iceing my dumb leg[s] because they hurt like a beast,but I'll be fiiiine. and besides that nothing's going on-we have practice Monday,and I'll be going to that...buut besides all the crap I said,there's not much going on,after all this iceing,then i'm getting a shower...and who knows what else,probably just laying around. Well I tried to make this entry short,but once again,it turned out long. oh well,sorry about that..cya for now i guess. &lt;|3</P>"

<P>Sunday-the banquet was fun/funny-lol,not going into detail,but that was fun..besides the fact that I had to wear a skirt. :/ oh well. Brad got Rookie of the Year,so that was pretty kick ass. [congrads! :) ] ummm. I don't remember what I did when I came home from Brad's,lol. </P>
<P>Monday-had school of course,that was dumb,then practice,..yeah,yada yada,don't remember. </P>
<P>Tuesday,school-practice [TIME TRIALS!] :/ I was nervous/excited all day long. For the 100[[that's a sprint for those who don't know lol]&nbsp;I got a 15:3 [kind of bad lol], umm 400 I guess I did alright. I got a 1:14[that's once around the track,like hard as you can go] ummm. 400 I was disappointed in myself at the very end,but overall I guess I did alright,I don't know,lol I don't want to say a whole lot about track because I get mad/sad/upset about some things,and I tend to be 'negitive'. AnYWAY...</P>
<P>Wednesday[today ..obviously]-School,once again,1st period was okay,I was tired,and not feeling good,[along with a bunch of other people today] we watched a movie 1st period for history,then I was off to gym class,felt like I was going to puke the whole time so I decided not to dress,and Mrs. Caferty didn't take points off or whatever,and I just sat/laid there the whole time like I was going to puke. And me not dressing was sort of a 'big ordeal' because a bunch of other people decided 'not to dress' and that they 'felt sick' when I was the one that actually FELT sick,but whatever. I don't really give a shit what people think of me,so they can think or say whatever....felt better after lunch,after I ate and everything. Got a pass for the computer lab for 2nd and 3rd lunch because I was sick of being stuck in homeroom. Went there,did my communications homework. Then tried to study for Spanish,but just talked about soccer with Macy. :) And just pretty much sort of got in a hyperish mood,I don't know,it was weird. Then after that,headed to communications,that was boring,but I made it fun..then Spanish,I was pretty crazy by then,and I was singing AC/DC lol,and wished Chelsea was in my Spanish class[long story]. ((and she went home sick :( )) After that,got to my locker,got my stuff,got ready for practice,but we didn't do CRAP because of the damn *snow*,yes snow,I'm sick of this goofy weather,and all this damn snow lol. It's offically spring and we're getting snow-what the hell? Snow= nonexcitement for soccer. The snow needs to go away. We need the nice weather back...track,people got uniforms,but I just kept mine from cross country..soo the rest of us there just stretched with the guys[girls went to get uniforms first] and then we did our drills/exercises in the hall..oh yeah and then we ran a couple laps in the hall..real dumb,and if I get shin splints I'll KILL....after that someone came down and said if we had uniforms and did stuff with the guys we could leave,it wasonly 4 lol and my ride wasn't comming til 5,but it's okay..then guys that didn't have uniforms went up and got theirs,I got ready to leave,used Megan B's phone and called home-Tim came to get me.</P>
<P>[gee this is long]-came home,pretty much did nothing,was hungry lol...</P>
<P>ALRIGHT lol that was beastly long but ohh freaking well. We/I have school tomarrow AGAIN. That sucks ass,BRAD,YOU SUCK ASS! lol. My cousin Brad only had to go Monday and Tuesday of this week,that freakin sucks because we only have friday and monday off of school,that is crap if you ask me. Brad has to go monday though,BUT STILL. They get off like 3-4 days and we only get off 2,that's crap I say,crap...OH WELL I suppose. Tomarrow,like I said,school,I have a test,and who knows what else. Practice was supposivley supposed to be hard on Thursday and Friday,but considering we got snow and crap today,I have no idea what coach(s) will make us do,...Friday we have practice at..? 9 I think? [someone please correct me if I'm wrong,but i'll get reminded tomarrow I believe],and Monday we also have practice,but I figured we'd have practice,because it was like that for c.c,ohh my oh well</P>
<P>I think I'm going to go,read some lesson I have to read for History because we'll probably have a pop quiz on it,or else some other stupid thing. Then I need to study for my vocab[how great :/ ] then I think I'll come out and make a baked-potato because I didn't really get any supper,lol earlier I ate a steak from yesterday,but yeah. Then after that I'm getting a shower and all that crap..pack my bag for track,yada,yada,yada,lol..and hopefully I'll get to bed early again,but who knows..welp cya. &lt;3</P>"

Then finally it was the end of 5th period,so I got to head to my locker,then the locker room and get ready for practice,yaay. :) lol we didn't really do that much today,did the usual warm up stuff,stretching,other two laps,then we separated into our groups,I went with sprinters,then we just did relay hand-offs and stuff,practiced that for a good bit. Then got out the blocks and came out in those and stuff,came out on the gun and all that crap-then we ran without the blocks,and did some starts. and that was pretty much all we did,lol it was boring. I wanted to go on like a 3 mile run though town,I think since track I really really do miss cross country-it's not the same at all,then again I wasn't expecting it to be. I don't know,I can't wait til next season for Cross Country,it'll be great...lol but before next fall,well next year comes,I have soccer comming,which makes me so freakin happy lol,and then my birthday[yess!] lol...welll i guess I'll just end this here because it's real boring and I'm rambling on and on as usuall..so later."

I bet..either that or we'll make up stuff like we always do-haha Lyss-""stick it to him on the mat..!""

<P>..soo anyways-as you can probably tell,I got to go to Brad's wrestling thing this weekend,lol--he got 2nd-woo hoo,and his buddy Matt got 1st I believe,they did good,there were other people from the team there too,I think they did good too,I don't really know for sure lol..but I bet they did. Well,skipping LOTS of things,Sunday[after I woke up from a nap at Brad's lol] we just sat around and stuff-and then a little after Brad came home I left-but he had to stay and do hw,that he didn't do anyway til later-lol so when I came home I had to do laundry,and shower and all that good stuff. Then I got online and talked to Brad and such. umm.. i dunno what else I did,but I was real tired this morning,blaah. So then went to school as usual-1st period I just laid there til Mr. Chonko started talking-2nd went to gym,did the norm. crap,then we played volleyball..umm then went to 1st lunch,ate,went to study period/home room,whatever. Sat there,blah blah skipping all that crap-went to Mr. Tate's class,that was boring as usual,I don't even remember what we did-read some of Romeo and Juliet..in his class,which was again,boring. Then 5th went to Spanish and Mrs. Leonard gave me a big headache-lol,I swear I'm allergic to Spanish or something,it almost always gives me a big headache. So then 5th period I was getting nervous/excited for Track. Wondering what they were gonna make us do or whatever,[i always get like that]</P>
<P>After that-went to my locker,got my stuff,locker room,changed,went out and sat in the hall with the rest of the people,then we headed out to the track,then we ran our warmup laps,then stretched,then two more laps. Then we did our little exercises lol-thenn we split into our groups,and I went with sprinters,I guess I'm going to sprint,unless i do the 800 or some other middle/long distance thing...then us sprinters and hurdlers? or somethin like that went into the school,and Coach talked about relays and showed us stuff,we practiced that-then we went outside,coach showed us other stuff,blah blah,hard to explain-lol,then we went inside,he talked about running on the road[stuff i alredy knew from cross country. :) ] thennn he said we were going on a run through town-lol that made my day,I was so happy. I love runs through town,it reminds me of cross country-and I like cross country better than running in a circle on the track-soo i was real excited. Town's only like 3 miles,so then we headed back outside lol,I loved running today,it was great. it was like,perfect/almost perfect weather. :) I tihnk I did real good,like running town,I felt like I had a kick the whole time, I didn't really get tired,I was real happy lol..umm yeah,soooooo there's not much else to say-this is real long but oh well,I have nothing better to do..lol..umm later this week I want/need to go get my hair cut,uhh lol i dunno i also need to do some shopping-who knows...</P>

"event","..hmmm. I'm tired of all this shit. Seriously. People yelling and shit. That's all I ever heard when I was little,since I can remember,and my parents and people STILL argue and ASK about the SAME things! It's so annoying and gay,and I just wanna cry,I think that's what i can't stand when people yell at me. I remember when I started getting older,like when I was in 3rd grade,whenever teacher's yelled at me I always wanted to cry..I dunno,people screaming and yelling always gives me the chills and brings shit up from my childhood...I think that's why I don't really like being around a lot of people,because it gets really loud,and most times I just can't really stand it..it drives me nutts. I dunno,and lately,well today,it was just a horrible day. Seriously,so much crap went wrong..I dunno,bad day I guess..just shit these days,it pisses me off,makes me mad. And really, I can't do anything about it. It seems like everyone's growing up,except me..everyone has a life,except me. I sit here at home,and pretty much do nothing. Unless I go for a run in this shitty town,or sleep,or watch TV,or get on the computer,the usual shit. Homework and school,sports,that's like,usual stuff people do,maybe I'll be more entertained since Track has started as of today..hopefully..who knows,but most of the time it's like every day's deja vu,however that's spelled,I don't really care...I don't know,I feel like the kid of the family,well,I am,I'm the youngest,but there's other people my age,and they have a life. Like Brad,he actually does shit,like he ..I dunno how to explain it,I guess i'm just not used to all the guys in my life not being there anymore,well they are,but not like they used to be. And it's like-I'm the only one not growing up,not having a life yet. When really you'd think I'd have a boyfriend,and be busy. But I don't do anything,I don't really like anyone...I dunno...I know too much shit,I've seen too many things,that I wasn't even supposed to ""witness"",and,as in most cases,it wasn't my fault,but others'..irresponsible people,that have no respect for anyone but themselves....who knows,sometimes people just get on my nerves,and I just flip out,have a breakdown. I'll get real emotional,just go insane..it's weird,sometimes I seriously do worry about myself,i dunno--well this is long enough i suppose,just had to get a few things out(this 'journal' is another reason/thing to show how pathetic and nonalife that I have,I write in it like whenever I can,which is usually everyday..whatever,who cares..bye I guess,sometimes I wish I'd never be able to come back,or just be invisable for that matter. later. :("

"event","<P><EM>*long,emotional entry-just to warn you*</EM></P>
<P>Brad made me cry..lol..real bad too. He's goofy. He just gets all serious and talks about the old times..lol,which was funny-and I cried..don't know why,lol I guess it's just how ""we women"" are when we get older,who knows..either that or I'm just emotional. But I think it's because I dunno,because Brad hasn't really been up in awhile-and we haven't talked about 'the old times' forever. The things we used to say,the things we used to do. Like whenever we'd sit out on the front pourch,lol with those desks,and those workbooks my mom had-and Brad would help me learn stuff before I started going to school. He was like,the teacher. lol-and how we used to climb trees,me all crazy-lol and I cant even see the keyboard when I look down because I'm getting ready to cry again..geez Brad. Josh is going to come out(like I said) and be like ,""what the hell?"" lol because I'm crying...I dunno,I guess Brad and I did have some good memories...also,how we used to dig out over by the side of the house(you know what I mean Brad) and thought we'd dig up dinosaur bones--or go out by that ""shed"" in the backyard and ""dig"" and lift things up-and say/thing they were dinosaur bones,when really they were/probably were just bones from a deer that one of my brothers killed. Or how all of us went down and ""Tarzan-ed"" under the bridge,lol with those bars underneath--that was crazy..lmao-and Brad and his famous: *ahhhhh/screams* <STRONG>""CRICK SPIDER!!!!!!!!"" </STRONG>geez,Brad's like-my 3rd brother..I dunno,except I think I can sort of tell him more-things I wouldn't tell my brothers,like how I'd tell Brad about guys and everything,whenever I wouldn't tell anyone else in my family-and if they found out,they found out. I didn't care if they found out,I just never told them. They always hounded me about it(still do) and everyone ""wonders"" why I'm not ""dating"" anyone,or ""going out with anyone"" or have a b/f whatever you wanna call it.</P>
<P>It's because everyone hounds me about it-even if I do or don't have a boyfriend,it's like,seriously,just give it a break. And I don't think anyone understands,not really,not anyone here anyway,not anyone&nbsp; I know of. I know so many people younger than me that have 40 million times more freedom than I do..not just to hang out with friends,or do whatever,just altogether. I know some people that have guy friends over at their house. If I did that-well no questions,or IF's,I just wouldn't be allowed. Seriously,everyone picks on me about it,and it's like gee,i wonder why-(exaggeration,obviously)-my mom's always like,""oh she's not interested in guys"" and its (seriously like) WTF..of course I am,you ass,I just dont say anything to you about it,because you're such a goof about everything,I mean,no wonder,look how you act,even when I DON'T have one,I can't imagine if/when I do--well I have before,but no guy has ever met any of my family-and im sure all HELL would break loose if they ever did,i never told my family anything about guys-and if i did,it was just Brad,and Brad alone. And also,I just haven't found anyone I like yet,lol I don't like anyone in our school,not at the moment,like I said in the last entry,eveyone's just real stupid..i dont know,i cant explain how i feel about that..

I never had ""talks with my mom"" about stuff,I never asked my mom or dad anything..nothing about anything. Seriously. When I was younger I either knew all the ""terms"" from my brothers,or from later-when I learned about ""that stuff"" in school. I never asked questions,I just took it for what it was..seriously...I wasn't really raised to talk to my parents about stuff,and I think that's why I am the way I am-not that I don't like myself or whatever,not that I don't like the person I am-I just know I would have taken back so many things and started over if I could have. I don't like thinking of it as regrets,just things when I really think about,that I wish I could change,or could have changed,or not done,but I guess that's what I regret is. Wishing you didn't do something ...and thinking about it later,and wishing you owuldnt have done, or said it,or whatever. Wish you could take it back...i dont know--but like I was saying,that's probably why I am the way I am...hold everything in,til I just explode and let everything out-and we all learned in like-kindergarten-1st grade,i dont remember,that that's not a good thing,to hold in anger,I remember learning it from Mrs. Fuller,or whtever her name was from Elementary school..</P>
<P>But that's how I am,I have noone to turn to,even friends,yea I trust them,but i just feel like they don't understand-and sometimes they don't need to hear my problems,they have their own,but I really have noone,so I hold it in,til I let it all out-and even then I don't let it out,I write it down,that's why I write my shit all the time,my poems,rhymes,songs,lyrics,whatever you want to call it./them...i have noone to turn to-and yes,i understand there's people out there worse than me,poor people,ill people,people that have diseases,that didn't deserve anything they have/or have gotten...and sometimes,they're probably happier than I am..and I guess that shows how horrible of a person I am,i dont know-i have a lot of emotions lately,ive been thinking a lot-(now i sound like you Brad)...i dont know-i dont wanna talk about all this anymore-ive decided to stop.....ill end on this</P>
<P>""how the fuck are you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?""</P>
<P>-Eminem-</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>(yes i was ""raised"" i guess,but right now i just feel like I,me could have done better,i duno its hard to explain how I feel,and you know what,you can go and say whatever to your damn friends,because i know this entry was probably interesting,and if&nbsp;you read it all congrads.,but just remember,im not writing it for you,im writing it for me. goodbye..everyone,i mean everyone,i hope you have a good night-and good dreams. ..night.)</P>"

"event","<P>today was just another boring day at school pretty much. We had a 2 hr delay though,so that was better than a reg. school day..I can't wait until my birthday-i dont know why,lol because I never feel like I'm older or w/e on my birthday,I just feel like it's almost another,reg. day..oh well I just wanna be 16 I guess. Now that it's March it's two months(counting march) and for days til my birthday-woo hoo! lol I would have a party,but I'm a loner and don't have that many friends,but I say that's a good thing-lolol because people here are goofs. I hope we move to H-burg lolol-I've said that 20 million times,but I do. It's a lot better there..because,well it just is. And a lot of people think the people there are ""stuck up"" lol well the people I know aren't,they're real awesome and outgoing people-lol and really hilarious. </P>
<P>Another thing: I think I need a bf soon,lol the last time I had one was,well last year,lol. But it's been awhile(that reminds me of Staind..)..lol but everyone in my grade's goofs,and everyone in the older grades are just as bad,there might be some cool/or cute people in older grades,lol but noone that would ever date me lol, and I don't really know any of those goofs anyway. The thing is-everyone thinks I'm just a stupid freshman,when really I should be in their grade anyway-lol as in the sophmores are usually the people that call us stupid freshmen-and everyone else that's upperclassmen...well whatever,who cares I guess. I just wish for once I could live out how I wanted to. 1st of all I'd actually be in the grade I'm supposed to be-10th. And I'd be @ H-burg school,and live there. And just be all insane,in a school with my cousin Brad,and his gf,Alyssa,lol that'd be the shit.-they're awesome lol-and now that I think about it,I haven't even known Alyssa that long-not really,but she's awesome lol........I dunno. Whenever you're around Brad's family everything's just insanely funny..and great. And here it's like people are so serious,and all I want to do is laugh-which I do,but I'm serious at times too. I dont know,it just seems like the people I know from H-burg are so funny,and out going,and people here are just retarded,lol,I feel like I'm in a cage,and can't go anywhere or do anything,and don't know anyone. Where in H-burg I don't even know that many people and I feel like I practically live there-besides the fact that I'm at Brad's almost every weekend-haha...oh well--I don't know how to say how I feel-juust,I hope we move-lol. sure,I'll miss the Cove,I grew up here-(like Brad said),but I think I'd just like h-burg a hell of a lot better. I think also because it's a bigger town than Roaring Spring,or Martinsburg,whatever. Or the fact that Brad's there,and he's an awesome cousin..and I don't know,just everything-who knows. I just don't know where I belong,but it feels like it's not here-either that,or&nbsp;I&nbsp; just don't want to belong so bad,that I wish I was somewhere else-but I don't think that's it-I really do want to be in H-burg with Brad and stuff like that-I dunno,it seems like everyone here's just-different..stupid,idiotic...............who knows-maybe ill say more about this later.........bye..</P>"

"event","ohh my. I realized today while I was jamming out,that these really are the best days of our lives. Right now. I mean we can get away with a lot of things that we never can/would be able to when we're older. If you really think about it,no matter how strict your parents are(trust me,my dad's insane),they still let you do a lot of things that they shouldn't. And you do the same. We need to jam out,eat what we want(because we won't be able to when we get older),and just do whatever,just be a teenager. Just go crazy. We also need to enjoy other things,even though it's hard to ""enjoy."" lol like puberty,I know,all of us have already went through it-pretty much all of us..because we're in 9th grade.(even though I should be in 10th,but that's a WHOLE 'nother story lol) But it's not like I KNOW that everyone has,lol so to that I'm not saying anything. But seriously,we should try to enjoy it,even though it's horrible,lol and I'm leaning more toward a girl opinion here..but some people go through early menopause-and guys you probably have no idea what that is,but you're not supposed to,not really.,,but anyways,and then they can't have kids..ever. So in that case I say we should be lucky to bleed,lol,and I know that probably most people wouldn't talk about this subject,but I am,because it's seriously something we should be doing. Enjoying what we get,and what we have,even if we do hate it. lol Just like I don't relaly like our school,I'd rather go to Hollidaysburg,for a number of reasons. But our school's a challenege for me,a BIG challenge to get a soccer team. And I like that,but I also hate it. ..and about the whole eating thing,we shouldn't be worrying about being FAT. I mean holy poop. just eat what you want,geez....oh well enough on this subject,this is my 2nd entry for today,but oh freakin well-later goofs."

"event","<P>haha. well. school was canceled today. I would have been happy with a delay..off's good though,but now we're going to have to make it up on one of our Easter vacation days. Oh well...welll...last night after I came home I got online and stuff like that-then I went back in my room and jammed out to music,lol. Which was great. I was hyper. I think Lucas got me going with all that wrestling lol,but it was real hot. damn kids I tell you..lol...well anyways,backing up a bit.</P>
<P>*Friday-Had a 2 hr delay-that was real nice..lol. :)....so then after school,I think I got on the computer a bit,then got my bag and everything ready to go to Brad's for the weekend. That was so fun/funny..as usual though. So Friday at 5-5:30 we all headed over to Altoona high for wrestling districts. Wrestling's pretty crazy lol..so that was real cool..lol Aunt Donna saw <STRONG>Sassafrass-Teabag</STRONG> there,that was HILARIOUS. lol..but me and Alyssa weren't as giggily and everything as we usually are..lol we were tired. But we did laugh a good bit. Okay-so long story short-Brad lost&nbsp;his first match..so he couldn't get 1st or 2nd place...&nbsp;So then after they all wrestled and everything and got showers we finally headed home and got to Brad's around 8:30-9ihs,we ate pizza,and shortly after headed to bed. Saturday Brad had to be over at the school at 8:30 a.m.&nbsp;lol,he didn't wanna get up though..but he did..So then we all got up around 10ish,or something,and they started at 11-11:30...that was a long day..we were all really tired. So then Sat. Brad had two matches. He won the first one,and lost the second. He needed to win two of them to go to Regionals. But he lost the second one. 3 to 2..but he still did really good. :).</P>
<P>&nbsp;So then they got a big break and all the wrestlers got to eat,and everyone went home for a bit I guess..so then 5 p.m we had to come back to Altoona,pay AGAIN to get in(that was a big rip off.)then Brad wrestled again whenever they got to his weight group (deerr lol) and he won that match,so he placed 5th. But he couldn't go to regionals because they only take the top 4 in each weight class,but like I said he still did good. He got a plaque. They all did..and 1st place winners got a plaque and a big bracket of all the people they beat and stuff like that. lol. Lots of fun times...I almost took a nap in the middle of the bleachers lol I just laid in there like between the tops of the bleachers you sit on,i laid inbetween those,lol my Aunt was like ""DANIELLE,WAKE UP!"" I was like ""what,what?"" lol..I was tired,and just suddenly got the feeling like I was going to be sick at one point. So I just laid inbetween the bleachers lol,and laid my hoodie over top of me and my face-lol. Then a little later I was like ""I feel a shadow over me"",so I open my eyes and Brad's HUNTCH is suffocating me,so I'm okay for about 5 seconds then I was like"" BRAD BRAD GET UP,GET UP,THE HUNTCH IS SUFFOCATING ME,I'm CLASTERPHOBIC!"" lol I freaked out lol,so then he finally got up and I was all hot and gasping for air lol..I was already between the bleachers,that was fine,but then there was a big back right infront of my face and half my body holding me down lol,and i freaked...so anyways-then after all that Brad finally took a shower there and then we left. We got back to his house around 9:30,maybe 10..then some of his friends came and they hung out and stuff..then I guess they went out,lol who knows.</P>
<P>I was supposed to go home Saturday night,but I was too tired,along with everyone else..and it was sort of late,so I just called and left a message for my dad and told him I was staying again. So i did..lol Sat. morning Lucas had a indoor soccer game,I went to it of course,they killed the other team..left there,went back to BRad's..then I don't remember what we did,I'm sure Luke started wrestling with me again lol..""I'll but a CLIP on YOU!"" lololol. Oh My. I seriously hope we mOvE to H-burg lolol,I love Brad and Lucas..lol they're such great cousins,especially Brad-but he can be an ass sometimes..like when I got mad at him Saturday..lol that was really MEAN by the WAY..making up crap that's not even TRUE. &gt;:0 lolol...oh well who cares. Sunday Luke had another game,but I didn't go because I wasn't ready-lol because I got a shower and stuff earlier there,and I still had on my p.j shirt..lol and it waslike 1,and he had to be at the Summit at 1,and his game started at 1:15,so my aunt was just like,we're not going,I got shit to do lol,that is what she said too...so then they pretty much worked..lol Lucas helped with the basement steps..and I told Aunt Donna if they needed help with anything that I'd help..but me and Brad pretty much did nothing. haha. Brad was supposed to clean his room up,but he didnt. lol He was having a Ho-Down in the living room,lol he made me dance with him lmao-he is such a HICK. Which reminds me of that PICTURE my aunt had of him-lmfao..OH MY that was hilarious. ""THAT PUTS THE POWER ON!"" lol ..Sunday I also talked to Alyssa on the computer,while Brad went in the basement and played pool with some of his buds..and his dad. That was hilarous-Trolls,and everything else. Alright this entry's really really really long lol--so I think I need to end it on this note.<STRONG> My weekend was pretty great. ;). later.</STRONG></P>"

"event","<P>Well well. Today was a boring day-as usual. Chonko's smiling face wasn't there today lol. We had some sub. and he was even more boring than Chonko..but Chonko makes me laugh for some reason...anywho. So then gym we did the usual,then ""us girls"" just played vollyball. I miss Mrs. Caferty. [we've had Mrs. Walters for like two-three weeks now.] (I think it's Mrs. anyways..oh well)...but she's cool because she always does the stuff with us in gym. She's real insane though lol. umm then went to lunch-the usual there. Then Tate's-boring also..blah..read crap in the other Lit. book.. :/ thenn I don't know,lol..don't really remember. Then Spanish,did the usual crap-new vocabulary,blah blah for Leonard. And that was pretty much my day. Nothing exciting went on..at all. lol. Just that is snowed all day,and that wasn't real exciting. Kind of annoying because it's spring and it needs to be sunny. lol so Soccer can start and so I won't freeze trying to run track... :)~ [sticking out his tounge]..but it probably will be..because track starts March 7th..again:: &nbsp;:)~&nbsp; Soccer's gonna start around March also. :))) :D YAY! lol I'm real excited but nervous. I'm playing up at N.B AYSO this year..new people..and also I'm going to have a woman coach.. :/ .. I've always had men coaches,so I don't know how that's going to be. But it's Macy's mom..and Macy's going to be on my team,well I'm on hers,lol whatever. :) So at least I'll know SOMEONE. :) umm. I'm hungry if you haven't noticed by that guy down there..lol he's real cute,with the little aprin or w/e on lol and the fork and knife in his hand--lol..umm soo tomarrow we MIGHT have a 2 hr delay,but I doubt it,lol. I hope we do though..it's pretty likely by the looks of things. </P>
<P>I know I've said this like 20 times in the last 3 entries lol or something like that,but tomarrow's Friday and that means I'm going to Bradley's..(and if the wheather doesn't cooperate(sp) then I'll be real angry. lol because wrestling districts better not be cancelled. I don't think they will be..because I mean,it's districts..lol. And plus all the spring sports are comming,and they can't just not have districts and stuff...soo that should be fun. well I'm tired of this lol and I'm talking to Megan :)) soo later. &lt;3</P>"

"event","<P>I'm just going to come out and say it. I'm tired of people touching me. DONT freaking touch me. If I wanted you to I'd tell you..or I'd touch you,which I probably wouldn't do to the few of you that ARE touching me anyway. So DONT freaking touch me. UGH! I can't freaking STAND IT...like I dunno,it's just guys,they're such...I dunno ""butts."" and it's always the people I HATE and dispise that decide they're going to touch me-not on accident,on purpose,and in a ""sexual"" way..its like WTF(sry for that buut im just really really mad.),don't freaking touch me! I don't know,it's hard to explain,but I'm sure you'd get it if it happened/happens to you. And everytime you just want to beat the shit out of that person,but you let it slide,just like you let other things slide,and it builds inside of you until you flip out on everyone who's ever pissed you off when you didn't say anything about it. And you always say ""next time"",it's always ""next time I'll hit them or bitch them out."" You know what,this was next time..and I WAS about ready to push them so hard he would have fallen on his freaking ASS..but you know what,I let it SLIDE. I think it just was so shocking that I was like what the F and just kept walking,when I really should have flipped out-and now it's going to bother me forever..maybe next time that little ass ""steps"" up and trys to touch me I'll really really really FLIP OUT. That'd be great if I just broke their arm or something-that'd be really funny,at least I'd think it would be. </P>
<P>I mean,listen to me-I'm talking about how I SHOULD have did something whenever my Icon an stuff says Speak Your Mind for my journal. I guess I just can't do that sometimes. I'm not really opinionated,not about people and stuff like that,it's just whenever people piss me off,that's when I usually tell them. Or I'll ignore them til they stop,and if they don't,they're done for..they're getting told/...whatever. EW i can't stand people here. Seriously. I dunno,there are a lot of great people here,but all the guys are asses(for the most part,they pretty much are if you really think about it) and all any of them (or most)&nbsp;want is&nbsp;a ""piece"" and that's not really right.((i mean by&nbsp;""really right"" because all guys are like that-or most,in some ways..but they just talk like that or whatever))&nbsp;I mean here we are,actually -trying- to have a ""relationship"" and they have to complicate it by all their sexual stuff..and you know what,sometimes it's the girl too,that does it. I mean it's so low,and just..I don't know,sick.</P>
<P>I don't freaking know,but I'm really upset about a few things..like people that constantly never leave you alone,even IF they don't talk to you. They follow and stare at you EVERYWHERE. It's so freaking annoying. I mean,one thing is liking someone,another liking them a lot. But there is a big line between liking/liking a lot,and then just plain being a stalker,and saying or ""hinting"" that you love a person whenever they want nothing to do with you,there's a line between like/really liking,and stalker/obsession. I mean,they don't know hardly ANYTHING about you,and they're so ""in love"" with you,it's like please just get over yourself,and ME while you're at it and just calm your freaking hormones. I mean holy CRAP take it freaking easy.........UGH i dont know,whatever im frustrated and don't feel like takling/writing/typing,WhATEVER anymore in this--later..please comment if you have suggestions for me or just a comment.lol..well,bye I guess...</P>"

"event","<P>weellllll. lol. This weekend was pretty great. Nice and LONG..and that means lots of SLEEP. :)) yay! lol. Well I don't remember what all happened Wednesday,but I think I posted that day? Oh well..maybe it was in the other journal. Oh well. Well then.....Thursday-I don't really remember what I did,probably nothing much. ? Who knows lol. Friday I don't really remember either? lol Saturday I ThInK I went in town with my dad,and when I was going to buy stuff he was like,""we're leaving"" lol so then I was like geez,so then we left. lol. Then went home,listened to music and did the usual I think,(can you TELL that I don't remember anything)Ohh wait,Saturday's when we went in town..lol. Well Saturday I went to my little cousin's b-day party @ Hoss's (yumm food) after that,Father was driving and I called my Aunt because she wanted me to stop by,but they were going to Tyrone..soo then we went in town and all that stuff. After that like I said,I probably just tried to occupy myself with the TV,Stero,(cds),or computer..lol thenn Sunday I don't remember what I did either lol..i dont remember anything important...Sunday the Fash had to work at 5 pm. and Tim and his gf were here watching a DVD-Josh went to sleep because he had work at 4 a/m and didn't get sleep all day. So I was doing nothing-(like I said,""trying"" to occupy myself on the computer)..talked to my Little cousin (Lucas)...umm so then I called them and they asked if I wanted to stay,so I figured my dad wouldn't let me because I was going to this weekend,but he was like well if you're going next weekend,stay home this weekend.</P>
<P>Wellll..I called him at work..lol and I waslike Daaad I'm real bored and there's NOTHING to do here..and told him all the situations..lol and that when Josh woke up he'd just go to /with Vikki anyways..Sooo he let me go-lol Dave came and Lucas came and picked me up..and when we got to Brad's/Luke's Brad and Alyssa were there--and Aunt Donna woke up-lolol which was Soo freakin hilarious...so I stayed over night there,we didn't do too much,watched a movie that night-lol then I stayed up and had a ""talk"" with my grandest cousin Bradley--lol...then went to bed around 5 a.m. </P>
<P>The next day Brad had wrestling practice at 1 or something,so my Aunt took him there and I stayed there with Lucas...umm my dad wanted me home before he went to work Monday at 5 p.m,so I had to go home early :( which was retarded..but oh well. So we went and picked Brad up @ wrestling,and his friend because they had to work on some report or something like that. So then Aunt Donna rode up to M-burg to pay her light bill lol,and they rode along. Soo then Aunt Donna bought us ice cream-yay lol..@ Richey's Dairy..lol..then she headed out here to my home..so then I got dropped off and did pretty much nothing the rest of the day. Just did the usual,then did laundry.</P>
<P>Today was really slow and tireing,boring as usual...4 days this week,but it'll seem like forever I bet. Friday I'm going to stay at Brad's again(I swear that's my second home lol)(but i won't be there when Track starts)..umm anyways,Brad and the team have districts on Friday,over at Altoona High-so I'll be over there,which should be really hilarious...Good luck to Brad &amp; the guys..umm that's probably about it. This weekend after districts and stuff I'll probably go in town with my dad..still have Christmas money-woo hoo. lol I know what I want to-so it better be there lol...that will probably/most likely leave me bankrupt of my mula til my b-day in May..(YES i cant wait til MAY! hell yea lol)) ummmm so i guess that's it....little long,about nothing,so sorry about that,..but I'm sure it occupied SOME of your time-at least if you're bored like I am it did..lol well later I suppose. &lt;3</P>"

So it was a pretty regular day. Boring and tiresome,because of lack of sleep and everything else...just because it's school I guess. </P>
<P>I'm so happy it's a looooooong weekend. Don't know what I'm gonna do though. Probably work out I guess,and listen to music,and the computer,as usual. Hopefully I can go to my cousin's sometime,lol I like live there..its like my 2nd Homestead lol...even if I can't/don't stay overnight,I still have to go,because I left some of my clothes there on accident whenever we went away last week..so I gotta go down sometime for those...umm. this week my little cousin has an indoor tourdement Sat.,and Brad has an away match in Derry on..? Friday? maybe it's Saturday too,I don't remember...and then next weekend he (Brad) has districts over @ Altoona school..so I'll be going to those :) woo hoo. lol good luck Brad &amp; Lucas with the sports.

So anyways,today I decided to update in here. I don't really have any ""thoughts"" to talk about this morning. Nothing interesting...but I did make a Toad in the Hole&lt;~hey Mrs. Sollenburger came in handy for SOMETHING.(haha) I've never heard of ""toad in the hole"" until her class in 8th grade..and I love them-so thank you to her. So I made one of those this morning (yuum) :)) and had a big glass of orange juice,so now I sort of feel healthy-lol even though eggs have fat stuff in them or whatever,and the butter I used to butter the bread didn't really help either,lol but I think I'm gonna go lift/do crunches and then maybe squeeze in a run before 5-lol I have lots of time..but around 4ish,I have to get ready to go to my Pap&amp; Gram's because it's gonna be my Pap's birthday in a couple days-and so they have a big get-together at their house every year,and a bunch of my cousin's and like an aunt of mine all have birthdays in Febuary, so we pretty much celebrate them all in one day which equals a lot of cake lol and food to feed everyone with. Well that's pretty much all I'm going to do-then when I come home from that I'll probably give my uncle and or cousin a call-whatever lol,and see about next weekend...&amp; i might go down there a little bit for the Superbowl..yay ! :) lol..Oh yeah,I forgot to mention I'm home alone,so I can just run around my house all crazy and not worry about waking anyone up(my dad and my one brother work later shifts,so they sleep until about 3,or 4 sometimes..well my dad usually gets up or is up,but Tim sleeps a lot lol)...welp I'm gonna see to my crunches and stuff lol-later. :)"

Woke up at 2 a.m,felt like shat,and felt like I was going to be sick-so I layed there like moaning in agony,lol,then felt I was going to be sick,ran out of my room,into the bathroom,and puked..yeah it was real gross....so THEN when I was done vomiting,..went,or tried to go back to sleep,was really really cold,so I was like slicked tight against the wall..(because the one side of my bed is against the wall,and the heater's there,so I always lay in the crack between the wall &amp; my one bed side lol)...so then I was real cold,chills and stuff-yeah..:/..so then I guess I finally fell asleep,woke up at 5 a.m,kept waking up at 5 a.m,like at different times-1st alaram went off at 6:20,second at 6:30,but I laid there,and figured I wasn't going to go to school because I still felt like&nbsp;crap,but then I went anyways,didn't bring my gym stuff because I figured we were getting weighed-well anywho,got the bus,but almost missed it,got to school felt horrible the whole day (knew i shoudlnt have came),then 1st period-Chonko we had Bonebreak,and she gave us like the completely wrong assignment and everyone spent all class working on it-horrible-2nd period went to gym,didn't have my stuff so I sat there with other people that didn't bring their stuff either-lol,then had lunch,then 3rd period went to Tate,had to do some GAY PSSA essay thing-don't even get me started on that-lol,that took forever,then Spanish,was just retarded as usual w/ Mrs. Lenoard,because you have to listen real close and well to even hear what she's saying/trying to say-because of her accent...then basically went home-didn't feel good,went to sleep-Fasha woke me up at 6:30-went to department store,got a bigger gym shirt,my other one was too small-then came home,ate,watched the OC,and now I'm here...&amp; i still feel like crap,but tomarrow's Friday so that's GREAT! lol..welp I'm done saying about my day,here's some retarded quiz I took because I was bored-so hopefully it works,if not,then I'm not going to try and fix it..lol wel later for now..</P>

"event","<P>I think one of the hardest things,well it's supposed to be easy,but sometimes it's quite tricky..is to tell if you really like someone,or you THINK you like them..lol. like what are the chances of liking someone that you hardly ever see? Not very likely I guess,but I 'suppose' it has been done. But the thing is are you infatuated,or do you really like the person? Sometimes its hard to tell,I'm sure most,if not all of us have been there at least one point in time. I don't knnnnoow...and then there's other times where you know someone likes you,so then it makes you think of them differently,then you THINK you like them,but really you might just like them because you know they like you..lol using all this 'think' word is hard to explain what I'm trying to say,or maybe the person is your complete opposite,we've all heard the saying 'opposites attract',but do they really? </P>
<P>I don't know-just some thoughts-confused about some things I guess,if you want to enlighten me,or help lol please comment....well I would have gone farther into my thinking but I 'think' I confused myself-lol..I don't knooooooooow............welllll..bye..maybe I'll talk more on this subject later..welp cya...</P>

<P><STRONG><EM>okay........so anyways.....Happy Holidays. . . . .some thoughts:</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>Sometimes you just have to laugh....well I always do-especially when people piss me off,or when they try to fix things,that can not be fixed,but I guess you can/have to give them 'SOME' credit..lol...see me,whenever someone pisses me off I just have to laugh at them...then I sometimes swear a lot too,lol because I'm mad,but I'm laughing...(Megan,you def. know what I'm talking about)...but usually now I just laugh and shake my head at them..because let's face it,it is pretty funny...but I guess if they didn't ""try"" something then I'd just be like well thanks-so either way it's screwy,,lol. But thenn,it's also like-if you don't want to hang out with me,then don't ask me to,you don't have to do <EM>anything</EM> because you never do,or just because you feel sorry-noone likes pity,I don't anyway...&amp;&nbsp;I think I'm quite fine on my own,I've been for like 2 years now-lol...yeah I'm a loner this year,but I still laugh,I still make fun of myself,I'm still nice. I don't get caught up in retarded things. &amp; this whole thing's just retarded-so you know what,I was disappointed-but now I don't really care,you can all go and have fun without me,because I'll have fun with myself-lol have my own party-&amp; noone's invited either. But I might see what my cousin's doing-but he'll probably be with his woman-lol oh well,even if I have to spend New Years alone,at least I'll have some peace &amp; quiet without all these assholes around me....who wants to be around people kissing at Midnight anyway? I don't know about you,but I wouldn't want to-lol unless I'm too busy kissing someone myself..which I won't/wouldn't be.</P>
<P>ohhhhh well-who cares lol. Life isn't about friends,yeah,it's nice to be around people and have fun-but later in life,these 'friends' won't even be around-and if even ONE is,you're reaaaaaaaalllly lucky...after high school,everyone goes separate ways-you meet new people,new guys,new friends,new experiences,new places,...then after college everyone goes their separte way again. Then you go to somewhere new-to get your job,then in the workplace you make new friends,new enemies,meet different people..and sometimes people leave,people retire...then when you're older you don't really have 'friends' just people you see at work,you don't 'go and hang out' unless you're both single still,which is pretty unlikely. When you're older you're not worrying about 'friends',you're worrying about your children,your job,your health,your children's health,your bills,your car,(as in troubles),money,finding a house-(or maintaing the rent-or pay for that house) there are so many other things,there are no time for friends....</P>
<P>so what can we do now? Try to have fun as much as we can-with people,with friends-but can we help it if they don't like us? No,we can not. No matter how hard someone trys,some things just come naturally,and others you have to work a lifetime to complete,but you have to decide how much time you want to spend on something...and this is anything...okay this is long &amp; I'm being real serious,so I lost where I was in my head--lol if that makes sense-welll....hope I made you think,or something.......later.</P>

"event","<P>..sometimes I just wish my mom would have left me in St. Pats until 9th grade-then I would have came to CHS..don't get me wrong though-I love my friends,am happy that I've met the people that I have-&amp; have had the disagreements,arguments,&amp; 'little fights' with people,because it has made me who I am-and I'm alright with those people today-there is no 'envy' or dread,whatever you want to call it. But sometimes I just wish I would be where I'm supposed to be..in 10th grade..I mean-my mom had no good reason to take me out of St. Pats,she just did,and I think it's just because something like that happened to her-she 'didn't like private school' or w/e somthing like that-so she got taken out. Well I don't care what happened to her-no one likes school,&amp; my brothers didn't like St. Pats either-they had to stay there. I just don't see why she couldn't have left me there..I was perfectly fine..just because I got into a 'little argument' with the teacher doesn't mean anything-I was a little KID...I don't know,once again,I'm thankful for my friends,and just all the people I know now...but sometimes you can't help but think what and where you would be right now if you could have changed one thing in your life-or,more like a couple.</P>
<P>But we can't go back and change things in our life that we'd rather not have,or have went through,we have to deal and make the best of what we have,..and I guess we're a lot more fortunate than other people in the world,but I think you know what I mean,I dunno,maybe you don't,but I know what I mean,I guess that makes sense,I'm the one saying it,and thinking it. I don't know,I just wish I wouldn't have to explain all the time why I'm 'older than everyone else' ,and if I don't explain then people are like 'ohhh you failed,' and it's like no I didn't you don't know jack about me,so don't freakin say crap when you don't know what went on..&amp; I know whenever I meet new people and they're like how old are you-what grade are you in,the first thing they think of is that-'she failed','she must be dumb-or pretty dumb'..*sigh* I don't know..just letting out some things.....later for now I guess.. :-/</P>"

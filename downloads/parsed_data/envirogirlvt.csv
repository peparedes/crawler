"event","My grandma Ruth died today. She was 94 years old. Pretty old huh? I'm impressed with her. I hope I get one tenth of her age genes. You know what though? I really don't want to wind up with alzheimers,.. it's a mean disease. 

Hope everyone's well...

I'm going to the funeral so I'll be gone Tuesday through Thursday. ... if anybody needs me. (hah, right.)

see you when I get back"

"event","Hello all. Just updating. Not much new going on, however last night I went to an AMAZING Ani DiFranco concert in Northampton. She rocks my socks man. Omg. I was like 6 ft from her! In-fucking-credible!!Anyways, did I say WOW?? It was wonderful. I've only worhsipped her for, well like 10 yrs! 

So that was fun, and today I'm exhausted. My gf is out getting paid for this job that we finished the other day. Yay. Lots of money money. Going straight to my poor little savings account. LoL, so I can blow it at school on books when I get back. Did I mention I'm taking a bumload of courses, and am overloaded? Oh yea, this could be an interesting year! 

Feeling alright..Gonna go play some Sims.

(Oh yea, and did I mention Ani is environmentally aware, politically awesome and gorgeous? ! LoL well she is) WOW!! xoxo

Peace, love and fight CO2."

"event","Oh yea, and just in case I didn't get my little environmental piece out there today, if you haven't seen it yet, go and see
AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH 
with Al Gore..

Amazing movie that seriously has to be seen by all. We need to do
something now, we really can't wait. It's already almost too late.
That means you all you keene state-ers... get on it. Talk to teachers,
vote responsibly, encourage solar and hybrid cars..etc. You know
what to do. You're smart individuals. This is our world, let's not 
let it die. 

Honestly, that's how I feel. Go SEE the movie. AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH. Al Gore.

Peace love, and hopefully a lack of CO2."

"event","I know this isn't a great way to start my journal, but whatever, it's life right? You ever have those moments when you sit back and go, what the FUCK am I doing? Having one right now. Wondering why I'm here, at this job. Supposed to be helping out a friend and turns out all she wants to do is everything herself. Now being the semi-domineering girl that I am, I at LEAST want something to do if I'm working...so this really sucks ass.

ANYWAY... on perhaps a better note, this job is over TOMORROW. I have pictures of every phase. We transformed this room, and ripped off the wood-panelling and then put up sheetrock and painted it. It really was kinda fun for the most part, until the painting shit, which SUCKED. If you're gonna do something,.. be a carpenter and NOT a painter...yech. 

I also came to a big realization today. In high school, I used to say I had no friends, and I'd basically be wrong...I really did they just didn't know me well at all. You know what I realize now though? I dont have any friends...anyWHERE anymore. Truth. Scary. When I lost my girlfriend last year, I lost my life, my animals, my love and yep, all my friends and allies went with her too. 

People at school...well frankly have never seemed to care. If they think they're showing interest, it's VERY well hidden. 

God, am I just awful to everyone, all the time??????????

Sorry to be such an awful bugger...better luck tomorrow?

On a slightly happy ending note, I'm house-sitting for my parents in Brattleboro starting tomorrow, 7/11 so I'll have access to a computer more often. Plus that means I finally get a little bit of time off and don't have to work. I'm pretty exhausted to tell the truth. Have been working all summer so far. Ugh. 

Peace...and help stop global warming."

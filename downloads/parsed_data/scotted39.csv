"event","<P>its 8:09 and i cant sleep (morning) this saddens me. so i just finished reading through all of my friends' old old entries cuz im that desperate for amusement. just had the yogurt. it was good. haha i used stealth mode to get to it, wanna hear how? good. so i opened my door very slowly cuz it creaks, then i peared around the corner into my rents room and my mom was on her stomach with her face in the pillow (how becomeing of you mom) but <EM>""daddy wasnt there"" </EM>cuz hes an early bird and likes to watch the sun rise or something dreadful boring while just as equaly painful know youre missing some awfully good sleep time, but he doesnt care. so anyway back to my mission impossible yougurt. so now&nbsp; i get down close to the floor like a spider and creep across the hallwway&nbsp; and into the kitchen. now to open the refridgerator i, placed my hand on the handle and pulled very slowly. i grabbed&nbsp; a carefully selected and&nbsp;essential to mission dairy the peach fruit on the bottom yougurt by Breyers <EM>Now Better Tasting.... Smoother and Creamier.</EM> And because the fridge is rigged i had to place something in the same spot so the alarm wouldnt go off so i grabbed and apple from the counter and stuck it in the fridge in the exact spot. so as i was in the prosses of closing the door i realize as soon as i shut this door im going to have 10 secnds to get outta there before my fridge detonates. so clearly the only thing i could do was slam it shut and sprint back to my room before i was insinerated. So i threw the door shut didnt bother to turn around did a double back flip&nbsp; and rebounded off the over onto the closet door and shot into the hallway. Well the beast from the worlds of slumber was stirring. What to do what to do, i did and airial dive over the threshold before she could turn and spot her meal (carniverous little monster). i rolled in to my bedroom and closed the door witht he utmost delicasy, for the maiden upstairs lady madison might be disturbed.so as i sit down to admire the fruit of my success i realize! I forgot the spoon! awww mannn!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; to be continued</P>

"event","<P>&nbsp;<FONT color=#cccccc>so vienna came, and now is gone... she came thursday night, n corey n i got her, then she met people that was kinda messy... lol. afterwards coreys mom took us (taylor corey V n i) to fatboys, fun. we ate in the back of coreys car, kinda squishy, but we managed. afterwards. we came to my house n hung out here. that was fun. then they left. friday went to school, and V met even more people, we walked around for a bit and then she had to go off to breakfast and do a tour of the school.&nbsp;after that corey n i juggled her throughout our schedual. lunch was a blast. we took alot of pictures there. (if i knew how to get them on here i would but i dont know how). after school on friday we hung out by the lockers for a bit n then off to rollerworld we went. that was pretty fun, n i havent done that in forever so i was really bad for the first half n hour or so. but we took pix there too. after that we came to my house and hung out here. then went to the seadog restauraunt where we played pool stuff then ate. after <EM>that</EM> we came back here and watched a movie till 11ish where they then left. saturday morning got up and went to portland. first we went to a lighthouse. it was okay not the best. BUT at the end of the lighthouse visit, vienna and i rolled down a big hill. hah that was fun! then we went off to the old port. where we walked around and went into stores and such. then we went to the maine mall. that was rather eventful. we got jackson a birthday present which was fun to do. so we left portland and went to sandras. where we got really ccrazyy! first we started off watching the notebook. finished that n went to sing kareokee in sandrees room. that was so much fun! somewhere in here sandra started pulling out strange articles of clothing. so by the end, corey had on a black tank top black leather pants a whip, several pairs of mardi gras beads and a tie in a bow on the top of her head. taylor on the other hand put on sandras fishnets and sandra got all hoochey. now this is where we pulled out the camara and took many pictures. once we rid our selves of our sins, we went off to do some galactic bowling. well it was full to for about 20 minutes the group of us (about 15 ppl ish) thought what we could do. lienna messier thought we should go to her house and watch a movie. we went there and watched shrek 2. so at 1ish we headed home to sandras. upon arrival we got our beds ready and said goodnight to taylor and jessica. so corey sandra vienna n i thought we should play a game. so we played 10 fingers till about 3ish. needless to say i am a very dirrty boy and lost miserably. after this we went to bed. got up around 7-8ish n did the breakfast thing then headed off to the school for the dreaded departure. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cccccc>so all is over now. but im planing to have vienna come down this summer to see how we mainahs get down. partying and such.. but who knows.</FONT></P>

"event","today during track, i was thinking during the workout thingy how i think really weird.(cuz im a loser like that)

so i do this thing where lets say i just met you k? n so we both like eace other (example) and in orer for me to call you, you have to call me 2 times before i assume its ok to call you. (wierd huh (i call it the rule of two)) 

if i see u in the hall. i usually wont call out to you (if i like or or weve been fighting or something) unless you call out to me, again at least two times.

aol is different, i have no issue talking to people on aol.

i make comments alot about people to other people, if i think theyre cool, but not as open obvious comments, as hidden, clues almost.

wow as i read back on this, im thinking, ""scott your strange, just leave it at that"". haha thins is kinda amusing me...

another thing is if i think youre really cool or something, i usually remember things about you, birthday, clothes, jokes, what ever... 

hold on the phones ringing...... nvm it was jenny, she wants taylor... she is confusing me lately. i dont no, i cant tell f she wants tobe my friend again or what. like we used to be insepreprable it was insane. now we dont even tlak to eachother and she sits next to me in lunch... who knows...


vienna is here in 17 days!!!!!!!! i cant wait!!!! but she hasnt been on in a while.... sad... if u want her sn just talk to me n ill give it to you..

"event","<P>so last night. saturday night. gina slept over. so we went to see the variety show. it was pretty funny. so afterwards we came here. grabbed food and ran upstairs to watch toothless. got dont that and came down here.we played cards for an hour, making it about 1in the morning. we got the fabulous idea we would sneek out my window and go running around in the nieghborhood. so we get on clothes and jump out my window and made alot of noise. we got scared cuz we thought would wake up but he was dead. so we go down my driveway and the light turns on and we book it. we ran so hard and fast. so we calm down after a while and walk around the other side of the block and this person is standing in the doorway and we see them and they see us and taylor and gina act all calm and keep walking but i just ran. then they started yelling at me cuz i wasnt <EM>playing it cool.</EM> so we make it back and into the room and we start google searching random images. it was fun till we got to ugly people then it was nasty so we had to stop. taylor went to bed right about then so it was just gina n me. we talked on the computer for about another hour and that was our night. rather eventful eh?</P>
<P>so now im waiting for the hot water to come on and its about 230 and were gonna head into brunswick. but i&nbsp; cant take a shower cuz gina used the lats of the water. so i have to wait till it comes back on.</P>

<P><FONT size=5>heres a piece of a song (semi-charmed kinda life) that makes me kinda sad and kinda happy all in the middle its : ""when im with you i feel like i could die and that would be alright."" its gives me a feeling of somthing i dont know what. it also used to be about someone but (as you might know) i think they declared its over.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=5>so someone yesterday *omit* started talking to me again. im really happy about it. i missed them. you prolly know who you are. but yea i missed you.</FONT></P>

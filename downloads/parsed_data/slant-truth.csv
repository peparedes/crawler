"event","and I've officially given up thinking I'm going to sleep any more than the 3.5 hours I already have. I wasn't supposed to get up untill 7:30, but I've been awake since 4 and can't deal with lying in bed staring at the ceiling any longer. My stomach is all topsy-turvy. I'm not scared, really; it's just nervous energy. Everyone cross your fingers that I can run on adrenaline (and possibly caffeine) until 5pm when we leave the reception for the honeymoon. Speaking of, my mom gave me the digital camera I wanted as a wedding gift, so I'll try to post pics of the honeymoon and maybe some wedding stuff when we get back. We're spending five days in NYC. I'm very excited. I'll talk to you all soon!"

It's below the cut<lj-cut><br />&ldquo;A Real Man is Difficult to Find&rdquo;: Gendered Identity Construction in She's the Man<br /> <br /> In his review for the radio station Westwood One, Bill Bregoli calls Andy Fickman's 2006 film She's the Man &ldquo;Mean Girls [with] a classic twist&rdquo; (Bregoli). The language of this review creates a binary opposition that privileges the contemporary teen movie archetype over its &ldquo;classic&rdquo; Shakespearean source; moreover, the review's language evokes comparison not to all contemporary teen films, but to a particular subgenre heralded and represented by Mark Waters' 2004 film Mean Girls. The film, based on Rosalind Wiseman's 2002 nonfiction parenting manual Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends, and Other Realities of Adolescence, follows former home-schooler Cady Herron's journey through her first year at North Shore High School as she works to sabotage The Plastics, the school's most popular and most envied clique. Over the course of the film, Cady eventually becomes Plastic herself and has to cope with how she has changed, ultimately learning that &ldquo;Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier. Calling someone stupid doesn't make you smarter. All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you&rdquo; (Mean Girls).<br /> The fact that Bregoli's review comparing She's the Man to Mean Girls appears on the back of the film's DVD release implies that filmmakers wish for the film to be viewed similarly--having a positive sociopolitical message to convey to its target audience of teen girls. This categorization is not implausible, given that the film was written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, authors of 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), which relocates Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew to a Seattle high school and turns Katerina, the titular shrew, into Kat Stratford, a &ldquo;ball-buster&rdquo; who listens to Ani DiFranco and reads Betty Friedan. 10 Things I Hate About You was widely criticized for its portrayal of teen feminism, with many critics having one or both of the following problems with the character of Kat : firstly, the fact that she listened to or read those things did not necessarily make her a feminist, and secondly, she is never actually seeing reading or listening to those things within the context of the film (Pittman 140). Her feminist reputation seems to be just that--a reputation. While critics originally touted the film as pop culture with the potential for social change, it is now typically viewed as a candy-coated presentation of political issues. <br /> While 10 Things I Hate About You ostensibly makes it acceptable for girls to challenge the status quo of high school gender roles through an awareness of feminist politics, the positive message of She's the Man appears to be one of gender equality : &ldquo;Amanda Bynes proves that girls can do anything guys can do in She's the Man,&rdquo; a statement from the film's official website proclaims ( HYPERLINK &quot;http://www.shestheman-themovie.com/&quot; www.shestheman-themovie.com). Writers Smith and Lutz echo this sentiment in the film's DVD commentary when they explain that the original conflict of the film involved Viola playing Hamlet in a school production, but that &ldquo;proving she could play on a boys' team gave it more of that female empowerment thing&rdquo; (She's the Man).<br /> Marketed as &ldquo;inspired by William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night,&rdquo; the film tells the story of Viola, a talented soccer player who, repulsed by her mother's desire that she become a debutante, impersonates her brother Sebastian at prestigious Illyria Academy after her school's girls' soccer program is cut in order to join Illyria's team and prove her worth as an athlete to her soccer-playing ex-boyfriend Justin. After the girls' team is cut and the coach refuses to let them try out for spots on the boys' team, Justin agrees with the coach's statement that &ldquo;You're all excellent players, but girls aren't as fast as boys, or as strong, or as athletic...It's scientific fact. Girls can't beat boys. It's as simple as that&rdquo; (She's the Man). When Viola reminds Justin that, just the day before, he told her she played &ldquo;as good as half the guys on the team,&rdquo; he feigns incredulity in front of his teammates before switching to anger and declaring, as if he is the angry parent of an unruly child,&ldquo;Viola! End of discussion!&rdquo; to which she responds, &ldquo;Fine. End of relationship&rdquo; (She's the Man). This exchange establishes the film's main conflict: it juxtaposes Viola, who represents self-assured, young femininity, with the exaggeratedly closed-minded, patronizing masculinity represented by Justin and the Cornwall coach, who seem not only to view women as inferior athletes, but to attribute this inferiority to innate biological difference. This argument recalls those employed by opponents of Title IX, first ratified by the U.S. Department of Labor as part of the Education Amendments of 1972. Section 1681 of the amendment forbids &ldquo;discrimination on basis of sex under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance&rdquo; (U.S. Dept. of Justice, 1972). While Cornwall Academy is a fictional private school, and therefore would not be under the jurisdiction of Title IX if it were a real educational institution, the fact that similar biologically essentialist statements are made by figures representing the values of this institution and those opposed to the amendment nonetheless serves as a notable piece of cultural commentary which seems to suggest that, though Title IX has been legally enacted and enforced, the existence of the biologically-essentialist viewpoint remains a large political problem that needs to be addressed on a deeper ideological level. <br /> How well does the film address this problem? It's clear that the overtly biologically essentialist arguments offered by the Cornwall coach are to be taken lightly given their hamfisted, over-the top delivery. The lines are delivered with a knowing smirk to a crowd of preening male soccer players, who are clearly less intelligent than the free-thinking Viola), but even so, the use of the word &ldquo;athletic&rdquo;--a type of ability one can possess regardless of gender--bridges the gap between &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; arguments about the relative speed and strength of the sexes based on biological differences and a socially constructed sexist ideology. While some may argue that this over-the-top prejudice exists for a broader purpose within the universe of the film (in order to endear the viewer to Viola's cause), the alternative to this unfair treatment does not seem to be much of an alternative at all when examined closely. If Cornwall represents the gender constraint that Viola's mother, coach, and ex-boyfriend impose upon her, then it follows logically that Illyria should represent a newfound freedom from those constraints, in accordance with the typical function of the pastoral in Shakespearean comedy. This is not so in the film. While the Illyria coach (played by well-known footballer Vinnie Jones, formerly of Sheffield United and no doubt cast because of his star-body's relevance to the film's subject matter) states that they are &ldquo;not sexist here in Illyria&rdquo; when trying to convince the referee that Viola is allowed to play on the boys' team according to the official rulebook, he repeatedly and derogatorily refers to his male players as &ldquo;girls&rdquo; when chiding them at practice, thereby employing a less-obvious form of the biological essentialism used by the Cornwall coach. This linguistic choice makes his defense of Viola seem motivated entirely by selfishness: he is defending her not because he believes in gender equality, as he claims, but because he thinks she is a skilled enough player to get him the victory over Cornwall that he desires. An admittance of this fact instead of a reliance on a weak, supposedly political argument would better suit the empowerment argument the film claims to have.<br /> Construction of Femininities in the Film<br /> In addition to the cultural issue of female representation in athletics, the film also seeks to comment on viable forms of femininity in contemporary society by juxtaposing femininities that seem to be negative because their goals are centered around their appeal to other (mostly male) people (Mrs. Hastings, Monique) with those that seem to be positive (Viola, Olivia, Eunice) because they let their own choices and desires define what they want. One of the main ways the film constructs its femininities is through different styles of the clothing worn by its female characters. In the beach soccer game during the film's opening scene, Viola plays wearing a navy blue and yellow bikini and short denim shorts. Her actions show that she is physically strong and athletically capable, and her outfit, by combining dark colors and comfortable fabrics with possibly provocative cuts, connotes a certain strong sexuality.<br /> The connection between Viola's athleticism and her awareness of her own sexuality is clear in the scene that immediately follows the soccer game. Justin lauds her athletic ability by saying she is &ldquo;as good as half the guys on the team&rdquo; and credits himself for teaching her to play. Viola corrects him by saying, &ldquo;Probably more than half,&rdquo; kisses him, then insinuates he isn't the only teacher in their relationship when she says, &ldquo;You couldn't kiss at all when we first started going out, but I've taught you well&rdquo; (She's the Man). Viola elevates herself above the majority of the boys in terms of athletic ability while also switching the positions in the power binary Justin has established: where he places himself in the role of teacher and her in the role of student, she makes herself the teacher and him the student. While Viola's self-confident sexuality is certainly empowering to a degree, this binary reversal makes it potentially problematic. First, by reversing the binary instead of breaking it down, Viola does nothing to improve the hierarchical social ordering principle in place; she merely privileges a different party. Secondly, her proud description of herself as Justin's sexual &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; aligns her with members of the contemporary, young third wave feminist movement who have been criticized for their &ldquo;sex-positive&rdquo; brand of feminism by both society in general and older feminists, those who think that they are not liberating themselves and owning their sexuality as they claim , but instead, that they arereinforcing the patriarchal stereotype of woman as a temptress who uses her sexuality to get what she wants. <br /> In their book Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future, Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards seek to define Third Wave feminism and what they see as misconceptions about young feminists. In the book's lexicon, Baumgardner and Richards define &ldquo;Third Wave&rdquo; as: <br /> the core mass of the current women's movement in their late teens through their thirties, roughly speaking&mdash;the ones who grew up with Judy Blume books, Free to Be...You and Me, and Sesame Street. Another way of looking at the Third Wave is as the &ldquo;daughters,&rdquo; both real and metaphorical, of the Second Wave, the women who read Ms. Magazine and Our Bodies,Ourselves, and lobbied for Roe v. Wade and the ERA. (Baumgardner and Richards 401-2)<br /> Jessica Valenti, founder of the popular weblog Feministing.com, adds a more sociopolitical definition to this historical one in her book Full Frontal Feminism: A Young Woman's Guide to Why Feminism Matters, in which she claims that young women who identify as feminists today &ldquo;do it [read: have sex] better&rdquo; because they realize that their bodies and sexualities are not commodities, but theirs to control as they see fit, and that they are less likely to buy into &ldquo;cultural myths of purity and virginity&rdquo; that operate as ways for the patriarchal hegemony to control female sexuality (Valenti 28-30). Viola's consciousness of and desire to control her own sexuality as evidenced by her discussion with Justin on the beach in the beginning of the film seems to ally her with sex-positive Third-Wave feminists as defined by Valenti.<br /> The Problem of Paul Antonio<br /> The montage during which Viola's friend transforms her into Sebastian complicates the reading of her as representative of third wave feminism, however. As Viola and her friends Mia and Yvonne try on wigs, mustaches, and beards of comically varying lengths and colors, a cover of &ldquo;Love is All Around&rdquo; is performed by pop-punk band The Tea Queens. This song is most well-known as the theme to the Mary Tyler-Moore Show, and helped the show represent a new segment of society (the single, self-sufficient working woman) when it aired in the early 1970s. As such, it became a sort of popular second wave feminist anthem (Dow 32). Setting Viola's initial gender transformation to this song aligns her with what Mary Richards culturally represented: a woman on a new social frontier who is questioning the mores of her world in order to &ldquo;make it after all,&rdquo; as the song says. Sebastian expresses the same sentiment to Viola just before he leaves to play with his band in London. He asks, &ldquo;'If you wanna chase your dreams, sometimes you gotta break the rules, right?'&rdquo; (She's the Man). Is Viola really &ldquo;breaking the rules&rdquo;? Even if she is flouting social norms by impersonating her brother, the presence and character of the apparently gay hairdresser Paul in this scene make her position as great social rebel a dubious one.<br /> The transformation scene is the audience's first visual introduction to Paul Antonio (we hear his voice previously as Viola pleads with him to help her, but do not see him until the actual transformation begins), who functions as Viola's fairy godmother (so to speak), as well as her guide to what it means to be &ldquo;the man&rdquo; of the film's title. Paul is a hairdresser at the Christophe salon--most likely a reference to the real Salon Christophe, an upscale establishment in Beverly Hills that has catered to a rich and famous client&egrave;le &ldquo;for over twenty years&rdquo;--( HYPERLINK &quot;http://www.christophe.com/&quot; www.christophe.com). As such, it is important to note that this reference connotes style and class. Additionally, the alteration to the logo is particularly indicative of Paul's position within the universe of the film, as well as his character's position within the genre of the teen movie with a positive message. In the film, the &ldquo;o&rdquo; in &ldquo;Christophe&rdquo; is a combination of the male and female symbols. While this symbolism could easily be a comment on the questioning of gender roles/traits done by the film in general, its direct association with Paul and his role as enabler of gender change is a loaded one. While the film never has either Paul himself or one of the other characters &ldquo;out&rdquo; him as a gay man, he is seen holding hands with Andrew, who appears to be his date, at the ball at the end of the film HYPERLINK &quot;&quot; \l &quot;sdfootnote5sym#sdfootnote5sym&quot; 5. <br /> Even before the ball, however, Paul is connected with a number of signifiers of a certain cultural representation of homosexuality. He is always well-dressed and groomed, much more so than any of the other male characters in the film. While this care of his appearance could possibly be attributed to his age and occupation (as a hairdresser, he would likely be expected to stay abreast of current styles and fashions, and because he has a full-time job, it can be assumed that he is at least a few years older than Viola and her peers, since they all still attend high school), when this particular sense of style is combined with his capacity as a source of wisdom on what it means to be a (presumably straight, in Sebastian's case) man, Paul seems to embody the fulfillment of the contemporary mindset, epitomized by the television show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, that gay men possess knowledge to make straight men better somehow. The official website of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy states that its goal is to &ldquo;treat each new guy as a head-to-toe project&rdquo; the result of which is that &ldquo;soon, the straight man is educated on everything from hair products to Prada and Feng Shui to foreign films. At the end of every fashion-packed, fun-filled lifestyle makeover, a freshly scrubbed, newly enlightened guy emerges&rdquo; ( HYPERLINK &quot;http://www.bravotv.com/Queer_Eye/about&quot; Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Online). This attitude seems to mirror Paul's, as well as to justify his character's minimal development. Unlike Damian, the character from Mean Girls who is fleshed out and humanized beyond a mere gay stereotype because of his relationships with the other characters (even though the audience is informed upon his first appearance that he is &ldquo;almost too gay to function&rdquo;), Paul is introduced in the transformation scene, talks to Viola on the phone once after that , and does not appear again until the climactic soccer match, where he appears to be accessorized by Mia and Yvonne, who are wearing outfits that match his. His pairing with Andrew at the film's end is never explained, though it appears to be a result of the adaptation's depiction of the common multiple marriage at the end of Shakespearean comedies, summed up in DVD commentary by director Andy Fickman as &ldquo;why everyone gets paired off at the end&rdquo; (She's the Man). Thus, Paul's presence in the film seems mainly to exist to make the film seem culturally hip and forward even as it complies to Shakespearean dramatic conventions, rather than to make a serious comment about the fluidity of gender or to question social heteronormativity.<br /> Clothing and Constructed Femininity<br /> While the women of the film exhibit this fluidity of gender to a very limited extent because each of them only seems to embody a single identity (as opposed to Duke Orsino, who is allowed to embody multiple valid masculinities simultaneously), it is necessary to note that the primary way in which the film differentiates between these various valid and invalid femininities is through the clothing that each woman wears. It is important that the sporty bikini and shorts is the first outfit in which the film's audience sees Viola, as it serves both to establish the kind of strong, sexually aware femininity she represents and set that femininity up as the one most worthy of emulation of the ones depicted in the film, as well as to contrast that femininity with other types seen later in the film, most notably those enacted by Viola's mother, Mrs. Hastings, Sebastian's girlfriend, Monique, and Illyria Academy's resident nerd, Eunice. <br /> If Viola represents young, sex-positive, self-confident femininity, then her mother models (and wishes for her daughter to model) a kind of femininity that is the polar opposite: stilted, passive, and above all, rigidly conforming to the norms of her upper-class social circle. Mrs. Hastings's first appearance in the film comes when Viola returns home just after learning that her team has been cut. She is dressed in a blue linen suit and pearls, clothes that simultaneously evoke both high social standing and traditional, restrained femininity. She is obviously meant to seem off-putting and over-the-top to the film's viewers from her first scene, when she enthusiastically unveils two full-skirted, copiously-ruffled gowns that she would like Viola to wear to the Stratford Junior League's Debutante Ball. This scene serves two purposes. It identifies Mrs. Hastings as a proponent of the traditional femininity represented by both the ball gowns and the event to which they are to be worn; and the fact that Mrs. Hastings seems to either be unaware of or chose to ignore her daughter's aversion to all things debutante suggests that the film's audience should view her as out of touch, a member of an older generation, one whose values are perhaps &ldquo;archaic,&rdquo; as Viola labels the debutante tradition (She's the Man). In addition to valuing traditional femininity, Mrs. Hastings likewise privileges traditional masculinity. She makes this clear when, after Viola mentions she &ldquo;dumped&rdquo; Justin, she asks, &ldquo;But why? He's so handsome and rugged and chiseled and great!&rdquo; (She's the Man). By using words like &ldquo;rugged&rdquo; and &ldquo;chiseled&rdquo; to identify Justin, Mrs. Hastings not only shows that she values traditional masculine stereotypes, but objectifies him in a way that makes her seem more like a teenage girl with a crush than a protective mother who wants her daughter to date the right sort of boy. While this complicates her femininity, and arguably makes her a more well-rounded character and not just a stereotype of the overprotective high-society mother, it also undeniably serves to make her type of femininity undesirable in comparison with that of Viola, who obviously does not need Justin to make her feel validated, no matter how &ldquo;chiseled&rdquo; he may be. <br /> If Viola is meant to represent the struggles of the third wave feminist, what then, is the connection between that movement's &ldquo;both real and metaphorical&rdquo; Second Wave mothers and Mrs. Hastings's traditional, passive femininity? The comparison appears to break down here, as Mrs. Hastings certainly does not seem to embody the struggles for equality lived out by second wave feminists. In fact, her involvement with such traditionally-gendered social organizations as the Junior League as well as her apparent valuing of the association of masculinity with strength and femininity with weakness seems to negate such an association. Instead, she seems to represent someone who has profited from the achievements of the second wave, but without acknowledging, or perhaps even being aware of, those achievements. She is a wealthy divorc&eacute;e with no apparent occupation, no doubt existing quite comfortably on the alimony payments afforded her because of rights won by second wave feminists. In that view, the comparison applies to a limited degree, thought it still ultimately distances the empowered, current Viola from her dated, out-of-touch mother.<br /> While Mrs. Hastings holds Monique up as an embodiment of the sweet, passive debutante, Monique herself seems to exist in the film to allow for the Mean Girls comparison under which it was marketed. Unlike Viola, Olivia, and arguably even Eunice, she has no Shakespearean counterpart. Though Monique partly serves as the catalyst for Viola's scheme to impersonate Sebastian (upon seeing Viola from behind as she's dressed in a hooded sweatshirt and jeans, she mistakes her for Sebastian, even going so far as to remark, &ldquo;You look scary alike from the back&rdquo;) and is therefore necessary to further the conceit of the film, she is viewed positively only by Mrs. Hastings (the film's other representation of confined femininity). Monique seems to serve chiefly as a foil to Viola and the other two characters who enact acceptable femininities in the film, Olivia and Eunice. Like those girls, her femininity is represented most obviously by her clothing, which is almost exclusively low-cut and tight-fitting. While Viola's semi-provocative fashions seem to evoke empowerment because they are combined with self-confidence and strength, Monique's clothing and physical appearance have a less-positive connotation because of her self-important attitude. When she shows up in the cleverly-named Illyria pizzeria, Cesario's, to look for Sebastian, and Andrew Aguecheek tries to flirt with her, she angrily responds, &ldquo;Girls with asses like mine do not talk to boys with faces like yours&rdquo; (She's the Man). She not only bases her own self-worth entirely on her physical appearance, but applies the same standard to her choice of boyfriends. It is no wonder that, in an instance of teen movie poetic justice, Monique is escorted by Viola's pompous ex, Justin, to the debutante ball. The fact that Monique's plot is wrapped up in such a way seems to set her up as sort of cautionary tale in keeping with the film's attempt at didacticism regarding female empowerment: if young girls invest themselves fully in embodying a femininity as superficial as Monique's, then their entire lives will be just as superficial, even if they look perfect by their society's standards.<br /> In contrast to Mrs. Hastings and Monique, who do not have Shakespearean counterparts and seem to embody negative femininities, Olivia and Eunice, who are appropriations of Twelfth Night's Olivia and Maria, respectively, seem to enact positive femininities in that they have respect for themselves and others and do not appear to gauge self-worth in terms of their involvement in a heterosexual relationship. Is there a connection between their Shakespearean source material and their positive femininity? If so, it seems to be counterproductive to the film's privileging of the teen-movie-with-a-message archetype. Regardless of whether or not such a parallel exists, it is essential to note that while Olivia and Eunice both enact positive forms of femininity, they do so in different ways and arguably, to different degrees because of the way their costumes place them within different social positions within the high school hierarchy.<br /> In keeping with the film's construction of femininity through costuming, Olivia is marked as different from the film's other physically attractive women by her style of dress. Instead of Monique's overt sexuality or Viola's athletic one, Olivia embodies a softer, slightly more modest sexuality by wearing t-shirts and denim skirts in pastel colors. Her sexuality becomes more overt after she is made an object of the male gaze enacted by Duke Orsino, when he sees her walk into the school cafeteria and turns his head so as to look at her without her knowing. This film does not frame his viewing of her as objectification, however, as evidenced by Duke's disgusted &ldquo;Don't talk about her like that!&rdquo; when Viola-as-Sebastian sees him staring at her, and, desperate to pass for one of the guys, crassly remarks, &ldquo;Look at the booty on that blondie!&rdquo; (She's the Man). Duke's demand that Olivia be treated with respect seems to suggest both that he views her as a person rather than a sex object (as Viola-as-Sebastian seems to assume he will) and that he has feelings for her. While Duke's defense of Olivia certainly calls Viola-as-Sebastian's preconceived notions of a necessarily misogynistic masculinity into question, other aspects of the boys' characterization of her complicate the audience's view of Duke, and, in conjunction, the way his masculinity is constructed.<br /> In Twelfth Night, Olivia is in mourning because her brother has died, as she tells Feste in Act 1, scene 5. In She's the Man, however, Andrew tells Viola-as-Sebastian the following about Olivia: &ldquo;Until recently, she was dating this college guy, but he dumped her, and I hear she's a total mess right now. [Her] confidence [and] self-esteem [are] way down . Toby then interjects, &ldquo;Yeah, so in man words, it's time to pounce!&rdquo; (She's the Man). These statements do several things to undermine Duke's sensitive masculinity. First, it turns Olivia into a prize for which men are competing. The mention of the &ldquo;college guy&rdquo; not only marks her as desired by other men, but by a higher class of men than Duke and his friends, who are still high school students. Andrew and Toby also employ the language of a certain kind of competition: hunting, wherein Duke is the hunter and Olivia his prey, as in the exchange between Orsino and Curio in 1.1 of Shakespeare's play. Also, Toby says that the words he uses to describe the situation are &ldquo;man words,&rdquo; thereby not only constructing a exclusively masculine language, but also characterizing it as predatory. Because Duke does not create the metaphor of Olivia-as-prey, it could be argued that his friends exist as a sort of foil for him and that they intensify the effects of his caring, sensitive masculinity rather than negating it. However, Duke's contribution to the conversation follows Viola-as-Sebastian's question about the identity of Malcom,(a hanger-on turned stalker of Olivia's who seems to be a combination of Shakespeare's Festes and Malvolio) who has just entered the cafeteria and seated himself next to Olivia. Duke quickly asserts that Malcom is &ldquo;not competition&rdquo; and &ldquo;a total geek,&rdquo; and while he does not objectify Olivia as blatantly as Andrew and Toby seem to, he still places himself above Malcolm in a hierarchy of masculinities as well as employs the same language of sport. Why, then, is Duke able to embody multiple masculinities at once, when, to exhibit multiple viable femininities/feminine sexualities, the film must show multiple women?<br /> In Twelfth Night, Olivia's attendant, Maria, is funny and sexually frank, as well as quite clever. In Act 1 scene 3, she jokes with Sir Andrew that his hand is &ldquo;dry&rdquo; after shaking it (1.3.55) She is, in effect, questioning his masculinity by calling him impotent, which shows that she is both knowledgeable of contemporary sexual lore and not ashamed of possessing this knowledge. She also masterminds the plot to humiliate Malvolio in front of Olivia by having him appear lovesick and insane. In contrast, Eunice (who I view as analogous to Maria due to her social rank and her eventual romantic involvement with the Toby character) is the school nerd, outfitted with the stereotypical glasses and headgear, and breathily promising Duke that she will &ldquo;be the best lab partner [he] ever had&rdquo; (She's the Man). While it is certainly true that Eunice herself is a sexual being, her sexuality is not seen as strong or self-assured by the film's audience as Maria's is in the play. Instead, Eunice's sex drive is played for laughs, as when, near the end of the film, she bluntly informs Toby that she &ldquo;know[s] tricks,&rdquo; and the next shot follows the two down to the ground, where they begin kissing in earnest (She's the Man). She is the stereotypical horny nerd, much like those made famous by Anthony Michael Hall in teen films of the 1980s (The Breakfast Club, Weird Science) and continued by Alyson Hannigan's Michelle in the American Pie trilogy of the 1990s. Though her strong sexuality is depicted humorously, unlike Viola's, I still include Eunice within the categories of positive femininity because she enacts this femininity of her own volition and to satisfy her own sex drive, not in order to conform to her perception of the sexual desires of others, as Monique and, to a certain extent, Mrs. Hastings, do. Additionally, despite her archetypal character, it could be argued that Eunice perhaps has more personal agency than Maria because of Maria's social position as Olivia's attendant. Indeed, when discussing the film's Shakespearean references in a featurette entitled &ldquo;Inspired by?&rdquo; director Andy Fickman mentions that Olivia's friend, who only appears in several scenes, has fewer than five lines the entire film, and is never actually referred to by name, is called Maria (pronounced &ldquo;Ma-ree-uh&rdquo; according to typical contemporary American pronunciation, not &ldquo;Ma-rye-uh&rdquo; as in Shakespeare's play) &ldquo;to keep that character in there&rdquo; (She's the Man). This comment seems to devalue Maria's confident sexuality (she is essentially erased and her Shakespearean name is mispronounced), which contradicts the supposed &ldquo;girl power&rdquo; message of the film as mentioned by the writers.<br /> Construction of Masculinities in the Film<br /> The film's definition of what positive masculinity entails certainly seems to be more complicated, more multidimensional than its definitions of easily-delineated negative and positive femininities. Additionally, Viola seems to let male stereotypes shade her portrayal of Sebastian, and she seems never to settle on how her/his masculinity should be performed. This is clear due to Amanda Bynes' ever-changing accent in the film, which, according to reviewers, spans the vocal spectrum from &ldquo;effeminate Alabaman&rdquo; (Phipps) to &ldquo;like she's on the phone to the school office: 'Viola is sick today, and this is her mother speaking.'&rdquo; (Ebert). This noticeable variance seems to comment that masculine stereotypes do not represent how men behave; that &ldquo;a real man is difficult to find,&rdquo; as Olivia complains. What then, constitutes a &ldquo;real man&rdquo; in the context of the film? The phrasing of Olivia's complaint is important when seeking an answer to this question. A real man is not &ldquo;hard&rdquo; to find, which would carry connotations of traditionally masculine sexuality due to the phrase's containing the word &ldquo;hard&rdquo; - a possible reference to erection. Instead, the film values masculinities that are less traditional, and seemingly more evolved or modern because they have the ability to show emotion, like Duke's fear of Malvolio, the escaped tarantula, or Paul's crying at Viola's entrance into the debutante ball. Writers Lutz and Smith confirm this goal in a segment of the DVD commentary called &ldquo;The Wrap Up&rdquo; in which people whose involvement was central to the film are asked to offer last words, by saying, &ldquo; We just want to promote romance and good times and shirtless, sensitive boys. We like those&rdquo; (She's the Man). This blatant admittance of male objectification complicates whatever presence of &ldquo;that female empowerment thing&rdquo; that exists in the film by merely reversing the power binary rather than truly questioning the gender system in place. Thus, though the emphasis on empowered women and sensitive men may cause the film to appear forward-thinking in regards to socially constructed gender norms, that emphasis seems to exist not because of the film's desire to make a statement about the construction of those norms, but because of the marketability of its seemingly progressive ideologies. <br /> Amanda Bynes&rsquo;s Star-Body<br /> Like the film's girl-power message, which seems in actuality to be more about niche marketing and a slightly underhanded reinforcement of stereotypically boy-crazy teen femininity, Bynes' star-body, while built on depicting her as strong and funny, but most importantly, as a typical teen girl, appears to have more to do with the kind of image sells to the female teen market at any given moment than a desire to positively effect the audience to whom the image is being sold HYPERLINK &quot;&quot; \l &quot;sdfootnote6sym#sdfootnote6sym&quot; 6. Billed as &ldquo; having a knack for slapstick reminiscent of Lucille Ball &rdquo; (They've All Got It), Bynes began her career at a comedy camp under the tutelage of Richard Pryor and Robin Williams. She then acted in several local Southern California theatre productions such as Annie and The Music Man before catching the attention of executives at children's television network Nickelodeon, where she was cast in the kids' sketch comedy show All That alongside future Saturday Night Live cast member Keenan Thompson in 1996. Bynes quickly became a fan favorite on All That, which resulted in her being given top billing and control of original characters on The Amanda Show, which ran on Nickelodeon from 1999-2002, and became Bynes 'gateway from bit sketch player to comedic film lead in projects like She's the Man and Sydney White (a 2007 adaptation of Snow White set in a California college sorority). Some of the original characters on The Amanda Show seem to have contributed to Bynes' &ldquo;Everygirl appeal&rdquo; as cited by The Boston Globe in 2006 (Tomlinson). For example, two of her most popular original characters were Judge Trudy, an obvious send-up of television's &ldquo;Judge Judy&rdquo; Scheindlin who always ruled in favor of children who brought their parents to her courtroom no matter the crime, and Penelope Taynt, an obsessive fan of Amanda's who would do anything to gain entrance into the star's presence while predictable hilarity ensued (Amanda Show). Both of these characters represent parts of Bynes' constructed &ldquo;Everygirl&rdquo; star-body. First, Judge Trudy plays into the fantasies of young children who desire to switch the parent/child power dynamic. If Amanda is playing a character who supports this, then, in the eyes of her fans, she must have the same sorts of problems with her parents as they do with theirs. Amanda is just like you, an average American kid. Penelope Taynt adds a different dimension to Bynes' star-body. Penelope functions to make light of Bynes's celebrity, while at the same time, glorifying it. While the lengths Penelope goes to to meet Amanda are absurd (disguises, fake voices, and silly gadgets galore) and she never reaches her goal (the same security guard carts Penelope off of the show's set at the end of nearly every incarnation of the sketch), and though it is sugar-coated by humor and pratfalls, the message of the sketch is abundantly clear: Amanda is a celebrity. She is not just like you, an average American kid, and don't think you can get close to her or be like her, because that is not going to happen, the sketch ultimately tells fans.<br /> Bynes continues this contradiction of approachability and celebrity in her most recent project: a clothing line for the retail chain Steve and Barry's. The line, dear by Amanda Bynes, is composed of affordable casual wear (hoodies, skirts, pants, tanks, tees, and accessories, all on sale for less than $10 apiece) and, due to its selection and pricing, presumably geared toward Bynes' target audience of young teen girls. In a video on the line's official website, Bynes echoes Viola's sex positive femininity by saying she has helped create &ldquo;clothes that let your personality breathe without hiding or covering up.&rdquo; She also echoes the same shaky message of apparent girl power by exhorting her consumers to &ldquo;Be quirky. Be intelligent. Be entertaining,&rdquo; and then immediately instructing them to &ldquo;defy labels&rdquo; ( HYPERLINK &quot;http://www.dearbyamanda.com/&quot; www.dearbyamanda.com). The first two imperative statements of that series appear to be liberating and encouraging to their young female audience by contradicting the norms of a kind of young femininity which exists mainly to satisfy the stereoptypical fantasies of young boys. If these young girls are &ldquo;quirky,&rdquo; they do not conform to a feminine ideal as constructed by males, but instead, exhibit a degree of individuality in the way in which they present themselves to others. If they are &ldquo;intelligent,&rdquo; they do not allow themselves to merely agree with or parrot the opinions of others because they possess the reasoning skills to form opinions of their own. While those statements sound liberating at first, the ad's third statement counteracts them. By telling the girls to whom it is targeted to &ldquo;be entertaining,&rdquo; it commodifies them by reducing them to an act that exists entirely for the (possibly sexual?) gratification of the audience of their entertainment. The fourth and final imperative, &ldquo;Defy labels,&rdquo; blatantly contradicts the previous three, all of which instruct their audience in proper behavior through concise adjectives that could easily be used to &ldquo;label&rdquo; someone. Bynes (or possibly the writer of the ad) appears either to have been unaware or to have disregarded this contradiction due to its presence in the final product (which, it should be noted, is itself marketed under a distinctive label). While Bynes' performance of multiple identities (and her encouragement of the same within her target audience) could be viewed as a positive embrace of multiple valid femininities by some, I would argue that its commodification ultimately transforms Bynes' star-body into one that actually reinforces the female status quo it purports to negate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .</lj-cut><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Hey guys. Thanks for your participation in my poll. Since you all helped so much, I thought you may like to see the final paper.<lj-cut>Feminism's (Mild) Fourth Wave: Common Ground for Evangelicals and Young Feminists?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though it is a sweeping generalization, it is not an inaccuracy to say that historically, evangelical Christians and feminists have seen themselves as working toward opposite goals. I hope to use this paper to explore why these two movements sometimes wrongly interpret each other as the opposition, as well as how they could work together to achieve a common goal. In this paper, I will explore the possible roots of the misconceptions that each group has of the other as well as discuss how their goals, their methods, and even their participants, overlap. Most importantly, I will examine a recent cultural phenomenon that could act as common ground for both parties: the so-called &ldquo;new modesty movement&rdquo; as articulated and heralded by author and activist Wendy Shalit.&nbsp; Before I explore the possible future of feminism, however, I feel that it is necessary to briefly recount its past.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feminism as a historical movement is typically divided into segments called &ldquo;waves.&rdquo; This terminology allows for divisions to be less static in terms of the point at which they begin or end, and more based on what women were experiencing, both personally and politically, at any given time.&nbsp; American first wave feminism occurred from approximately 1848-1920, is widely thought to have originated with the (primarily female) proponents of the abolition movement, and held women's suffrage as its primary goal. Famous American first-wave feminists include Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Alice Paul, all of whom signed the Declaration of Sentiments at the Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, New York on July 28, 1848. The signers of this declaration used The Declaration of Independence as a model, and pointed out the sexism deeply engrained in US politics of the time with the addition of just two words to a familiar statement, which then read &ldquo;all men and women are created equal&rdquo; (Stanton 71, emphasis mine). With those words, not only was a movement established, but a precedent of reactive adaptation of the norm was set that would be followed by generations of feminists to come.&nbsp; Many critics of this first-wave movement claimed that its proponents were neglecting their natural femininity in trying to enter into what had been a traditionally male sphere of influence.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the twentieth century, second wave feminists built upon the achievements of first-wavers by extending the presence of women in the public sphere first established by their enfranchisement in 1920. Second wave feminists worked to use these broad political rights to obtain rights that seemed closer to where and how women lived their lives day to day: within their marriages, as they raised their families, and in the workplace. Typically, second wave feminism is split into two disparate movements : second wave liberal feminism and second wave radical feminism.&nbsp; Liberal feminism is typically thought to have begun with the widespread entry of women into the workforce during and after World War II.&nbsp; This phenomenon so fundamentally changed the structure of the American family's everyday routine that, after the war ended and many women were told to give up their jobs and return to their homes, they became dissatisfied about the role(s) their society expected them to fill. Out of this dissatisfaction, many women also became depressed and were subsequently diagnosed with the vaguely defined and rarely discussed &ldquo;housewives' syndrome,&rdquo; which Betty Friedan called &ldquo;the problem that has no name&rdquo; in her landmark 1963 book The Feminine Mystique. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While second wave liberal feminists worked to change&nbsp; mainstream America's traditional view that the woman's place was in the home, second wave radical feminists felt a modification was in order<br />to America's view of a woman's place in a particular part of that home: the bedroom. Publications like Erica Jong's 1973 novel Fear of Flying sought to eradicate the stereotypical view of women as wholly receptive and passive sexually. In the book, Jong tells the story of Isadora Wing, a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage who is being pressured by her family to have children. Isadora fantasizes escaping from this life into a &ldquo;zipless&rdquo; sexual relationship. Her ideal relationship is zipless not only physically&mdash;she visualizes clothes unzipping and unbuttoning themselves flying off as if by magic-- but emotionally as well, as its other qualification is that she &ldquo;not know the man very well&rdquo; in order to avoid any emotionally-motivated complications. This combination of stereotypically feminine romantic tropes with the stereotypically masculine desire for no-strings-attached sex revolutionized how Americans thought about female sexual desire and behavior.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second wave feminists popularized the phrase &ldquo;The personal is political.&rdquo; From the 1980s into the new millennium, third wave feminists pushed the second wave notion of the political nature of personal life in new directions. While &ldquo;the personal&rdquo; still referred to those issues important to the ways in which individual women lived out their everyday routines, more aspects of the personal became accepted forums for political expression. Popular culture was chief among the new areas of third wave activism, with the arrival of bands such as Bikini Kill on the cultural scene signaling the birth of so-called &ldquo;riot grrrl&rdquo; culture, an arena in which girls could express their dissatisfaction with a culture in which they felt oppressed and ignored by combining traditional forums of creative self-expression like music, art, and theatre with the political ideals important to them. Third wave feminists also built upon the efforts of second wave radicals in the area of female sexual expression as they tried to dismantle what they viewed as an oppressive, patriarchal system from the inside by appropriating its tools (namely language or sexual action as a means of degrading women) for their own usage. To that end, third-wavers tried to reclaim words like &ldquo;bitch&rdquo; and &ldquo;slut&rdquo; and turn them into words with positive (or at least less negative connotations through a cultural pervasiveness brought about by publications like Leora Tanenbaum's Slut!: Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation published in 2000, and Bitch Magazine, edited by Andi Zeisler and Lisa Jervis, which began publication in 1996 and is now on its forty-second quarterly issue. Because of their attitude that female sexuality is not something to be ashamed of, but instead should be viewed as a positive form of self-expression, third wave feminists are often called &ldquo;sex positive&rdquo; feminists.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is this sex positive culture that troubles Wendy Shalit, who heralds the &ldquo;new modesty movement&rdquo; that she has labeled &ldquo;feminism's (mild) fourth wave&rdquo; (Shalit 2007, 45). Shalit is the author of three books concerning the need for an evaluation of our current culture's views of young female sexuality:&nbsp; A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue, released in 1999, Girls Gone Mild: Young Women Reclaim Self-Respect and Find It's Not Bad to be Good ,released in 2007, and The Good Girl Revolution: Young Rebels with Self-Esteem and High Standards, released in 2008. The first acts as Shalit's manifesto in favor of a necessary cultural revival of sexual and physical modesty, the second discusses the pitfalls of&nbsp; our current &ldquo;Girls Gone Wild culture&rdquo; and proposes more positive alternatives for young women (Shalit 2007), and the third is a series of profiles of young women Shalit feels are rebelling against the destructive effect of that previously-mentioned culture and changing their respective societies for the better. While Shalit herself is ethically Jewish but non-practicing and some of the modesty movement's participants claim to have no particular religious affiliation, their pro-modesty views have a great deal in common with those of many evangelical Protestants, and therefore, could, and I believe, should, be discussed in light of their possible effect on the future of the Evangelical movement. While the modesty movement is not an overtly religiously-motivated one, it shares two major characteristics with Evangelical Christianity. The first is a belief that reacting to the needs and habits of the culture that is in need of reform (whether it be a patriarchal one or an unsaved one) is the best way to affect change upon that culture, and the second is that young people are a necessary medium through which to affect that change.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite a seeming reluctance to directly connect her her movement with a religious desire for modesty, Shalit begins her first book with two Biblical epigraphs. The first and most relevant to my argument includes Genesis 3:7, which details the result of Adam and Eve's eating from the forbidden tree: &ldquo;Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they perceived that they were naked; and they sewed together fig leaves and made themselves loincloths&rdquo; (Shalit 2007, ii).&nbsp; This verse's relationship to Shalit's pro-modesty message is a complicated one.&nbsp; It seems to suggest that the need for modesty is one that exists only in a post-lapserian world; Adam and Eve's embarrassment at nudity is a direct result of a consciousness which itself is a direct result of their disobeying God. That cause-and-effect relationship seems to contradict one of A Return to Modesty's main points: that modesty motivated by embarrassment is something that innately exists within women. While I suspect that this contradiction goes unaddressed mainly due to Shalit's desire to make her movement more universally palatable by not connecting it to ideals exclusive to any one religion, I feel it is important to point it out.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The modesty movement certainly markets itself as a culturally reactionary one. Shalit makes this clear in the titles of the first two of her three books. By addressing a perceived need to &ldquo;return to modesty&rdquo; and &ldquo;rediscover&rdquo; it, Shalit implies that it was lost through some sort of wayward shift in mores, and that a cultural change is necessary to remedy this shift. Shalit posits that the root of this gradual shift is that young men and women are taught by elementary and middle school sex education programs to both &ldquo;overcome their embarrassment&rdquo; about and &ldquo;take responsibility for their sexuality&rdquo;&nbsp; before they are ready to discuss or think about such matters (Shalit 1999, 22).&nbsp; What public schools promote as an exercise in equality and self-knowledge, Shalit argues, engenders an erosion of embarrassment that both sexualizes children too early and ignores naturally-occurring differences in the ways that boys and girls think about themselves.&nbsp; She cites a case from the New York City public school system in which four boys ages nine and under forced&nbsp; a nine-year-old girl to perform oral sex on one of them on the school's playground while the other three looked on.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the traumatized third-grader told a teacher,&rdquo; Shalit reports, &ldquo;she was merely advised to wash out her mouth and was given a towel wipe&rdquo; (Shalit 1999, 19). Shalit suggests that because these boys are taught in school that sex organs are just body parts &ldquo;no different than an elbow,&rdquo; and also taught that they should treat girls as their equals without regard to biological gender difference, &ldquo;then they are that much more likely to see nothing wrong with certain kinds of sexual violence&rdquo; that older generations (and US lawmakers) view as heinous crimes, because, Shalit asks, &ldquo;What's really so terrible in making someone touch or kiss your elbow&rdquo;? (Shalit 1999, 19) Rather than enforcing an equality that disregards biological gender differences, Shalit suggests that American society, groomed as it has been on the social construction of gender, should stop viewing &ldquo;essentialism&rdquo; as a dirty word and instead realize that an extreme anti-essentialist mindset directly contradicts the notion established by second wave feminists that women can define themselves and their sexualities in any way they choose, provided that that self-definition occurs on their own terms.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shalit repeats the reactionary theme&nbsp; established in A Return to Modesty and focuses it on a particular part of contemporary culture she finds morally reprehensible in Girls Gone Mild. In order to understand the cultural commentary within that book's title (or, indeed, to write/perform it as Shalit did), one would have to have at least a passing familiarity with the Girls Gone Wild video series, directed and marketed by Joseph R. Francis and boasting over seventy titles, most of them multivolume.&nbsp; These videos are sold through late-night informercials and typically contain shots of scantily-clad college-aged women kissing, gyrating, or engaging in other sexual acts. While Wendy Shalit clearly sees this enterprise as exploitative to the young women involved, Joe Francis mentioned in an interview for Rolling Stone magazine that &ldquo;the girls [in the videos he produces] don't need much convincing to do their part&rdquo; and that he thinks&nbsp; &ldquo;a lot of young women [believe that] it's titillating to break the taboo and all the more thrilling to think that millions of people might see them doing it&rdquo; (Grigoriadas).&nbsp; Francis' view of sexual expression as empowerment seems to align itself with that of many third wave sex-positive feminists. Just as Shalit points out that the argument for &ldquo;public expression of a private sexuality&rdquo; neglects the presence of the male gaze observing that public expression, many mainstream feminists think that framing Girls Gone Wild and other similar exercises in female objectification as empowering or beneficial to the feminist cause is reductive at best (Shalit 2007, xii). For example, Ariel Levy, author of Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture regrets the association of female empowerment with the current cultural prevalence of brands like Girls Gone Wild, Playboy, and the Pussycat Dolls [what she calls &ldquo;raunch culture&rdquo;], saying, &ldquo;A baseline expectation that women will be constantly exploding in little blasts of exhibitionism runs throughout our culture.&nbsp; Girls Gone Wild is not extraordinary, it's emblematic [of raunch culture]&rdquo; (Levy 33). Though she reports that some proponents of this culture view it&nbsp; as &ldquo;evidence that the feminist project [has] already been achieved,&rdquo; Levy herself posits that that is not the case, that, in participating in this culture, the &ldquo;female chauvinist pigs&rdquo; of her title have not surpassed or subverted patriarchal oppression, but instead, have made its work easier by willingly objectifying both themselves and other women (Levy 3-4).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only do Shalit and Levy share a disdain for the culture made mainstream with the spread of sex positive feminism, but they also agree on who to blame for sex-positivism going too far: the second wave radicals. While Levy accounts for other cultural factors like the media's sexualization of violence against women insofar as the spread of sex positivism is&nbsp; concerned, she does suggest that second wave radicals should be held somewhat responsible for&nbsp; the sex positive third wave's out of control extension into raunch culture due to the fact that they were the first to bring female sexuality into the mainstream. She states, &ldquo;Even though this new world of beer and babes is foreign to sixties revolutionaries, it is actually also a repercussion of the very forces they put in motion&mdash;they are the ones who started this&rdquo; (Levy 45). Perhaps predictably so, Shalit is less forgiving of second wave radicals for &ldquo;start[ing] this.&rdquo; In A Return to Modesty, she suggests that the social pressures that today's women face -- &ldquo;to be perfect and thin and have no laugh lines, all while balancing a career and a perfectly orgasmic sex life&rdquo; &ndash; come from second wave manifestos like Friedan's The Feminine Mystique&nbsp; and Simone deBeauvior's The Second Sex, which Shalit says told women &ldquo;that they couldn't stay home with their children, even if they wanted to&rdquo; (her response to Freidan) and &ldquo;that they couldn't be round and had to cut themselves of from their bodies&rdquo; (her response to deBeauvior) (Shalit 142). These &ldquo;codes of conduct,&rdquo; Shalit says, &ldquo;grounded us&rdquo; and &ldquo;pointed us to what was truly important.&rdquo; (Shalit 142). Her use of the word &ldquo;truly&rdquo; in that passage points again to her belief in an innate feminine role, one that contemporary Evangelicals seem both to share and to fault the second wave for devaluing.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the True Woman '08 conference held in Chicago the weekend of October 9-11, 2008, thousands of Christian women from all over the United States gathered to &ldquo; discover and embrace God's created design and mission for their lives, reflect the beauty and heart of Christ to their world, intentionally pass on the baton of Truth to the next generation, and pray earnestly for an outpouring of God's Spirit in their families, churches, nation, and world,&rdquo; according to the conference's mission statement (www.truewoman.com/about). In one of the conference's lectures entitled &ldquo;You've Come A Long Way, Baby!,&rdquo; Mary Kassian, a professor at Southern Baptist Seminary and the author of the book The Feminist Mistake: The Radical Impact of Feminism on Church and Culture, hypothesizes that because of feminism's influence, &ldquo; the epitome of empowered womanhood is to live a self-serving, self-righteous, neurotic, narcissistic, superficial, and adulterous life&rdquo; (Kassian). Kassian goes on to regret the downward spiral feminism has caused for true womanhood over time, saying, &ldquo;In a few short decades...the ideal of a happy, fulfilled woman has gone from one who serves and exalts her children, her husband, and her community to one who serves and exalts herself&rdquo; (Kassian). While her opinion is certainly not an uncommon one, the overall content of her speech should be examined more closely to determine what it is to which she is actually objecting.&nbsp; First, the titles of both this speech ad the book that inspired its inquiries are references to second wave politics in particular. &ldquo;You've come a long way, baby!&rdquo; was the tagline for a popular series of Virginia Slims cigarette ads that ran in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while Kassain's book The Feminist Mistake&nbsp; is clearly meant to recall the title of Betty Freidan's book The Feminine Mystique which came out in 1963 and became a representative text of second wave liberal feminism, as I previously mentioned. While I do not object to Kassain's implication that undesirable traits expected of today's women could be a result of events set in motion by the second wave (an argument, you'll recall, echoed by both conservative feminist Wendy Shalit and more mainstream feminist Ariel Levy), I do object to the proof she presents for this argument over the course of her speech. In order to prove cultural attitudes about female roles held in&nbsp; both past and present, Kassain exclusively cites pop cultural representations of women that have appeared on television. In addition to referring to the Virginia Slims ad that told women they could step out of their housewifely duties, Kassain also mentions The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Murphy Brown, Ellen, Sex and the City, and, as her representation of the femininity we should aspire to regain, Leave it to Beaver.&nbsp; While Kassain is right to assume that these pop cultural representations of women do reflect the cultural attitudes regarding women prevalent in the time in which they were produced to a certain extent, she is wrong to assume that they accurately portray the ways that real women experience feminism in their everyday lives. Bitch Magazine coeditor Andi Zeisler responds to this common misconception in a chapter of her book Feminism and Pop Culture cleverly titled &ldquo;We Haven't Come a Long Way, and Don't Call Me Baby!&rdquo; In this chapter, Zeisler uses the same Virginia Slim ad to explain how ad agencies and corporations, whose foremost goal is, of course, to sell their products, appeal to the feminist mindset in order to do just that (Ziesler 57-60). By relying exclusively on these cultural artifacts that, because they want to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, are necessarily general and reductive in their portrayal of broad, complex ideologies like feminism, Kassain seems to say that it is easier to place blame on an entire movement than to actually engage with the members of that movement, none of whom have lives or problems as cut and dried as those presented on so-called feminist television shows.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider, for example, members of the Christian Feminist blog, whose tagline is &quot;This (Christian Feminism) is not an oxymoron. These posters enagage with difficult concepts like the biblical definition of submission and how to reconcile biologial gender differences withh socially-constructed ones(Christian Feminist). While Wendy Shalit does not do everything right in her pro-modesty texts (Girls Gone Mild makes similar oversights regarding pop culture to the ones I pointed out in Kassian's speech, for example) the fact that she makes a point to philosophically enagage with actual feminists&nbsp; while espousing a conservative viewpoint and a belief in an innate female role should prompt Evangelicals to get beyond the stereotypes and attempt to get into the conversation themselves.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; .</lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","Hi, all! I hope you are having a happy holiday season. I'm working on a paper for a conference in February. The conference is on Evangelicalism in America, and my paper hypothesizes that the new &quot;Modesty Movement&quot; heralded by Wendy Shalit in such books as A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue (1999), Girls Gone Mild: Young Women Reclaim Self-Respect and Find It's Not Bad to be Good (2007), and The Good Girl Revolution: Young Rebels with Self-Esteem and High Standards (2008) is common ground for discussion between Evangelical Christians and young Feminists.

She seems to have been nutured specifically for a career not just in performance, but in a performance informed by activism and an appreciation for high class art, as her &ldquo;infatuation&rdquo; with &ldquo;the Bard&rdquo; seems to connote.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">On the one hand, this fansite biography paints Stiles as almost fated for greatness: born to parents who both supported and participated in the arts and raised in the politically aware and creatively rich environment of New York City, she had no choice but to be precocious and vastly intelligent. This is where the bias of the composer of the biography begins to make itself evident. It is impossible she was actually &ldquo;a student of everything,&rdquo; as the site claims, for example. The biography is not content to attribute Stiles's success to merely an accident of birth and environment, however, as is evident when it leads up to the beginning of her acting career by saying:<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:

And, as it happened, they did.

It seems unrealistic to assume that many eleven-year-olds would have enough self-confidence simply to take pictures of themselves and ask theatre companies to hire them, sight unseen. While the positive spin of this biography is clearly at least partially due to the fact that it was written by someone who admires both Stiles and her body of work to a great degree, it is still worthy of analysis because it clearly maps traits that she is known for as a celebrity (she is politically aware, intelligent, independent and fiercely self-motivated) back to their apparent cultivation in her childhood.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">While celebrity personae (especially those marketed to teens conscious of the latest trends) are arguably ever-evolving, certain personae are worth closer analysis due to their functioning as representations of identities worthy of imitation during the time of their popularity. I will refer to these personae as &ldquo;star-bodies,&rdquo; using the term coined by Angela Keam in her article &ldquo;The 'Shakesteen' genre: Claire Danes's Star-Body, Teen Female Fans, and the Pluralization of Authorship,&rdquo; wherein she makes it clear that the body she is discussing &ldquo;is both professional and corporeal&rdquo;--there is a certain blending of the perception of the actor's body of work and her physical body or her as a person. Julia Stiles represents one of these bodies because of her dominant presence, not just in teen films of the late 1990s and early 2000s, but in a certain kind of teen film: adaptations of Shakespeare's plays, or &ldquo;Shakesteen&rdquo; films, to use another term coined by Keam to describe this popular turn of the century trend (Keam 2). <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">From 1999-2001, Stiles starred in three of these films -- 1999's <i>10 Things I Hate About </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">You (Dir. Gil Junger), 2000's so-called &ldquo;slacker </span><i>Hamlet</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">&rdquo; (Dir. Michael Almereyda) and 2001's </span><i>O</i><span style=""font-style:
normal""> (Dir. Tim Blake Nelson). The fact that these three Shakesteen films placed Stiles on the celebrity radar of American teens sets her up as a different kind of teen actress: one who connotes the consummate Shakespearean actress: academic, talented, and highly cultured. The fact that these films are adaptations marketed primarily to American teenage girls in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, however, also makes Stiles a different kind of Shakespearean actress. Unlike Sarah Berndhardt or Ellen Terry before her, Stiles conceives of a more modern Shakespearean heroine; one that is independent, that questions the way the world around her is constructed, and, above all, one that is informed by feminist politics. Several of Stiles's non-Shakespearean film roles have also contributed to the perception of her persona as one that embodies this type of empowered, intelligent contemporary femininity, most notably 2001's </span><i>Save the Last Dance</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> (Dir. Thomas Carter), 2003's </span><i>Mona Lisa Smile </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">(Dir. Mike Newell), and the forthcoming filmic adaptation of Sylvia Plath's </span><i>The Bell Jar</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">, in which she has signed on to play Plath's fictional counterpart, Esther Greenwood. In this chapter, I will examine Stiles' star-body as constructed by her roles in these films as a force in the formation of teen identity. Additionally, since Stiles's prevalence in the teen market tapered off in the early 2000s, I would also like to examine a more current trend in female teen identity formation&mdash;one that presents itself very differently than and is being marketed as reactionary to the type of teen identity represented by Stiles in her heyday as &ldquo;queen of teen:&rdquo; the modesty movement (<a href=""http://www.juliastilesfan.com/information/biography""><span style=""text-decoration:none;text-underline:none"">&ldquo;Biography&rdquo;</span></a>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;line-height:200%""><u>Stiles's Star Body Part One : Feminism</u><o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">Gil Junger's 1999 film <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> was Stiles' first starring film role as well as her first Shakespearean adaptation. In it, she is Katerina &ldquo;Kat&rdquo; Stratford, a senior at Seattle's Padua High School, whose classmates commonly describe her as a &ldquo;heinous wench,&rdquo; if her guidance counselor is to be believed. Like her namesake in Shakespeare's play, she rebels against social conventions, but she does so by opting out of her high school's dating culture, much to the dismay of her popular sister Bianca. Their father, an obstetrician who says he's &ldquo;up to [his] elbows in placenta,&rdquo; and, as such, has an extreme fear of his own daughters turning into the teen mothers he sees every day, takes advantage of Kat's choice by forbidding flirty Bianca from dating until her sister does (</span><i>10 Things I Hate About You</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">). Later in the film, the audience learns that Kat's choice to abstain from dating stems from a regretted sexual encounter with Joey Donner, the very boy whom Bianca desperately wants to date. Kat tells Bianca that that event changed her outlook on life, saying, &ldquo;After that I swore I'd never do anything just because 'everyone else' was doing it. And I haven't since&rdquo; (</span><i>10 Things I Hate About You</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">). In addition to showing that she is comfortable going against the status quo to suit her personal principles, this admission exhibits that Kat both is able and finds it necessary to exert control over her own sexuality, rather than letting it be dictated by a patriarchal power structure. In keeping with Kat's choice to go against the status quo by refusing to participate in her high school's mechanism of normative relationship structure, the filmmakers use a number of obvious cues by connecting her with artifacts of twentieth century culture that carry strong feminist connotations. to. One character remarks to another that &ldquo;she prefers angry girl music of the indie rock persuasion&rdquo; and cites Ani DiFranco and Tori Amos as examples, Kat is seen reading Sylvia Plath's </span><i>The Bell Jar</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">, and she has a discussion about Betty Friedan's </span><i>The Feminine Mystique </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">with the boy who is paid to date her so that Bianca can go to the prom. Each of these things is typically associated with feminism and is not necessarily either negative or positive. After hearing what kind of music her sister listens to and that she doesn't date, however, another character asks Bianca whether Kat is &ldquo;a k.d. lang fan,&rdquo; thereby insinuating that Kat is a lesbian and, in so doing, relying on the negative stereotype of the angry lesbian feminist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">In addition to being associated with cultural artifacts that have come to be representative of the feminist movement, Kat thinks of herself as a social activist. She suggests to her friend Mandella that the two of them boycott their school's prom because it is an &ldquo;antiquated mating ritual,&rdquo; and Mandella responds to the idea of a protest by saying, &ldquo;Oh, goody! Something new and different for us!&rdquo; (<i>10 Things I Hate About You</i><span style=""font-style:
normal"">) This exchange both reiterates Kat's disdain for traditional gender roles and, because of the sarcasm with which Mandella delivers her response, lets the film's viewer know that Kat stages protests frequently (and most likely requests her friend's involvement just as frequently). Later in the film, when her English teacher asks for opinions on the assignment that they have just finished (reading Hemingway's </span><i>The Sun Also Rises</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">), Kat laments &ldquo;the patriarchal values that dictate [her] education&rdquo; and asks him why their curriculum does not contain more works by female authors. He responds, &ldquo;I know how difficult it must be for you to overcome all those years of upper middle-class suburban oppression. Must be tough. But the next time you storm the PTA crusading for better... lunch meat, or whatever it is you white girls complain about, ask them </span><i>why</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> they can't buy a book written by a black man!&rdquo; (</span><i>10 Things I Hate About You).</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> This exchange makes Kat's penchant for protesting clear once again while also suggesting that, even as she claims to be oppressed as a woman, she is not aware of the social privilege afforded her as a White, educated woman. Many Womanist and Black Feminist thinkers have expressed this view of White feminists, most notably Kimberle Crenshaw in her discussion of the &ldquo;theory of intersectionality,&rdquo; in which she posits that the oppression faced by Black women is compounded due to its overlapping in the areas of race, class, and gender (Crenshaw). While the film does still set Kat up as its protagonist, this exchange humanizes her by suggesting that her understanding of her world is limited by her own standpoint. In turn, Stiles is also humanized and made more approachable even as she is marked as socially informed. Because Kat is flawed, even less socially conscious viewers of the film can relate to her without feeling guilty about their lack of involvement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">In 2003, Stiles co-starred in another film that claimed to espouse feminist politics: <i>Mona Lisa Smile</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">, directed by Mike Newell with an all-female principal cast including Julia Roberts, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Kirsten Dunst, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Marcia Gay Harden. The film is set in 1953 and tells the story of Katherine Watson (Roberts), a California feminist who &ldquo;is not married because she chooses not to be,&rdquo; accepts a post teaching Art History at Wellesley College, and, upon discovering that it is &ldquo;a finishing school disguised as a college,&rdquo; seeks to change her students. Stiles plays student Joan Brandwyn in the film. Joan is set up from the film's beginning as the student most likely to break out of the patriarchal society in which &ldquo;Wellesley girls&rdquo; appear to be groomed to participate: in the film's first shot of her, she is smoking a cigarette. This is a symbol of defiance of social norms because, while many of the film's young women smoke, it is not an acceptable practice in social situations outside the college's walls, as etiquette and poise teacher Nancy Abbey (played by Marcia Gay Harden) says several times in the film (</span><i>Mona Lisa Smile</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">). After the first shot of her, the next thing the audience sees Joan do is lead the rest of her classmates up to the door of the college's main hall, knock, and ask for entrance, proclaiming: &ldquo;I am Everywoman!&rdquo; (</span><i>Mona Lisa Smile</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">).When asked her purpose for wanting to enter the hall, she responds, &ldquo;To awaken my spirit to hard work and dedicate my life to knowledge&rdquo;</span><i> (Mona Lisa Smile</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">). It is significant that the film frames Joan as spokeswoman for her peers in this scene, just as the words she speaks are significant to her character. When taken together with the previous shot of her smoking, these three things make Joan a woman who is intelligent, driven, slightly rebellious, and not afraid to either go against the status quo or act as a leader. Not only does the character of Joan as read by her opening scenes resemble the star body of Julia Stiles herself, she also appears to be the perfect proteg</span><span style=""font-family:&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;"">&eacute;</span> for Katherine Watson within the universe of the film. Watson herself seems to think so, and takes Joan under her wing, encouraging her to apply to Yale Law School after Joan reveals that that has always been her secret dream. Joan gets accepted to Yale, and it is here that her character's dilemma takes shape: she must either negotiate the demands of law school while being married to her &ldquo;Harvard sweetheart&rdquo; Tommy Donegal, or choose between law school and marriage (<i>Mona Lisa Smile</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">). Joan discusses this problem with Katherine Watson after Katherine visits her with applications for law schools that are &ldquo;close enough to Penn (the school to which Tommy has been accepted) to have dinner on the table by five&rdquo; in order to enable her to &ldquo;do both&rdquo; (</span><i>Mona Lisa Smile</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">). In this discussion, Joan both establishes her own agency in making the decision to forgo law school in favor of marriage, and seems to be accusing Katherine of being close-minded in her desire to impart her feminist beliefs on her students. Joan's agency and her accusation of Katherine are most evident when she says the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:

200%"">In establishing the agency of a female role that is traditionally thought by many feminists to be unwittingly maintaining and enabling the patriarchal status quo as well as claiming that those who claim feminist beliefs often overlook the standpoint of the individual in favor of furthering a larger political agenda, Joan is prefiguring the views of many of the participants in the social movement popularly labeled as &ldquo;the opt-out revolution.&rdquo; In the <i>New York Times </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">article that brought the phrase into national parlance, Lisa Belkin defines the majority of this movement's participants as the women who have benefitted from the gains of Second Wave feminism by earning admittance to prestigious (and previously all-male) universities, risen in their respective professional ranks, and then made the active choice to &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; of the workforce in favor of marriage and family (Belkin), much like Joan does in the film.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">According to her official fansite, Stiles &ldquo;considers herself something of a feminist&rdquo; because &ldquo;she won't take roles where all she does is fancy a boy.&rdquo; The site accepts this definition of feminism without questioning it. It also mentions her involvement in a 2002 production of Eve Ensler's <i>The Vagina Monologues </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">as proof of her personal feminist politics </span><i>(</i><span style=""font-style:normal""><a href=""http://www.juliastilesfan.com/information/biography""><span style=""text-decoration:none;text-underline:none"">&ldquo;Biography&rdquo;</span></a></span><i>).</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> Though those things have feminist connotations, the site's view of feminism seems to be reductive at best. Its first point of reference represents an entire social movement using very specific cultural shorthand without explaining the significance of the latter within the former. Its second point of reference reduces women to their sex function. Both approaches are problematic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">Many scholars and critics of both <i>10 Things I Hate About You </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">and</span><i> Mona Lisa Smile</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> think that both films share the same reductive view of feminist politics. In her article &ldquo;Taming </span><i>10 Things I Hate About You</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">: Shakespeare and the Teenage Film Audience,&rdquo; L. Monique Pittman argues that &ldquo;[the film] works hard to soften the obvious gender inequities of [Shakespeare's play], but in many ways silences honest and serious debate about gender in the process&rdquo; (Pittman 146). She argues that the film does this by appropriating the rhetoric of choice and applying it to conformity, as I have previously mentioned, and says that this appropriation ultimately results in the assignation of agency &ldquo;in the most traditional of ways&mdash;to the young men determining their destiny and coming of age,&rdquo; though the film purports to be about &ldquo;the young teenager capable of defying all social structures and forging a self in complete freedom from the world&rdquo; (Pittman 145, 6). In other words, though the film appears to support the individual agency of its teen characters, it actually reinforces traditionally hierarchized gender roles that privilege male individuality and give female characters agency based on that of the males with whom they are in romantic relationships. In addition to its focus on agency, Pittman's article is particularly relevant to my examination of trends in teen identity formation because she includes and analyses responses to the film given by her own high-school English students, only two of whom (out of the thirty-five total students asked to write responses to the film) noticed that &ldquo;gender roles are set up and played into, rather than looked at and examined&rdquo; (Pittman 150, excerpt from student essay). Pittman concludes that &ldquo;the ways in which the film manipulates its audience to embrace longstanding stereotypes of gender declares the success of the film in addressing its target audience&rdquo; (Pittman 150), thereby claiming that commodification and maintaining the status quo go hand in hand, and even suggesting that one necessitates the other. Because it will always be more marketable to be rebellious, however, it benefits those in power (in this case, filmmakers and studio executives in charge of marketing and advertising) to frame conformity as non-conformity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-left:4.5pt;text-indent:
31.5pt;line-height:200%"">Most critics of <i>Mona Lisa Smile</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">'s portrayal of feminism see this framing as the root of the film's problem, like </span><i>The Guardian</i><span style=""font-style:
normal"">'s Peter Bradshaw, who calls the film &ldquo;a desperately insincere lite-feminist version of </span><i>Dead Poets Society&rdquo; </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">(Bradshaw). Stiles herself responded to those who criticized the film's feminism in the very same publication, in an editorial entitled &ldquo;Who's Afraid of the 1950's?&rdquo; In the article, Stiles first explains the impetus for her writing it by recounting a meeting with a fan who told her that she &ldquo;hated&rdquo; both her performance as Carol in David Mamet's </span><i>Oleanna</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> and her performance as Joan Brandwyn in </span><i>Mona Lisa Smile</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">. Stiles assumes that the woman disapproves of Joan's choice to be a homemaker rather than attend law school and goes on to say that she &ldquo;found the stranger's commentary curious, given that her vitriol was directed towards diametrically opposed representations of women [because] Joan is a conformist by nature, while Carol is unrelenting in her non-conformity to the point of being a masochist&rdquo; (Stiles). She then transitions into a response to Cherry Potter's </span><i>Guardian </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">article &ldquo;Frocks and Feminism.&rdquo; In the article, published a mere three days before Stiles's own, Potter denigrates the &ldquo;spate of Hollywood retro movies&rdquo; that, despite their feel-good messages, seem to &ldquo;forget feminism,&rdquo; and instead, &ldquo;seduce their audiences&rdquo; with aesthetically pleasing period details, </span><i>Mona Lisa Smile </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">among them (Potter). In both assuming that her audience desires a simply-resolved film that follows the formula of &ldquo;an unthreatening after-school special - like those television shows geared toward children, where the idealized protagonist makes the right choice, to set an example for viewers to follow,&rdquo; and not returning to the fan's initial complaint, but instead, using the anecdote as a way to respond to what she obviously views as a direct affront, Stiles appears to be talking down to the audience of her films. Indeed, she goes on to mention that the film would have only appealed to &ldquo;those already familiar with feminist theory,&rdquo; were it not for the &ldquo;pretty frocks&rdquo; and other details of which Potter espouses her disapproval. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">Additionally, Stiles places herself on the privileged side of the intellectual deficit she laments in her target audience in several ways throughout the article. First, her title, &ldquo;Who's Afraid of the 1950s?&rdquo; seems an echo of the title of Edward Albee's landmark play <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">, which in turn, forces a mental connection to the writings of Woolf herself (probably most specifically to &ldquo;A Room of One's Own,&rdquo; in this case), a great deal of which dealt with issues of burgeoning feminist politics. The rest of the article reads like a college term paper, with Stiles first grounding the film in the sociopolitical and historical milieu &ldquo;just prior to the publication of Betty Friedan's </span><i>The Feminine Mystique</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">,&rdquo; citing that the film's characters experience &ldquo;the malaise that Friedan outlined in that ground-breaking text,&rdquo; and ultimately arguing that &ldquo;to show a group of young women in the 1950s so quickly ascribing to a modern sense of empowerment would be historically inaccurate,&rdquo; and that contemporary feminists should be able to look beyond one-dimensional labels pertaining to female roles, and in doing so, &ldquo;challenge the notion that being a feminist is in opposition to being feminine&rdquo; (Stiles). Stiles's diction and references to landmark feminist writers and texts mark her as academic and knowledgeable in the article, distancing her from her (apparently less academic and knowledgeable) audience just as her abrupt change in the focus of her argument at the article's beginning does. Additionally, her conclusion is that the important thing about feminist politics is not the choice that a woman makes about her social role, but instead, the fact that she has multiple valid choices available to her both aligns her with Joan and makes her seem open-minded and progressive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;line-height:200%""><u>Stiles' Star Body Part Two: Positive Social Message</u><o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:

Once there, she falls in love with Derek Reynolds, a street-smart African American hip hop dancer.

First, the conversation verifies Stiles' celebrity (Carolla says she is &ldquo;now everywhere,&rdquo; in other words, she has a large public presence in the time at which he is speaking). Second, it places her as a certain kind of celebrity. She is coded as attractive and desirable, as all celebrities are in some way, but the specific kind of attractiveness attributed to her is important. Carolla differentiates between Stiles and more glamorous or &ldquo;hifalutin'&rdquo; celebrities like Catherine Zeta-Jones, which codes Stiles as attractive in an approachable way that is more edifying to the common man's view of himself, when he says he &ldquo;could get her in [his] mind.&rdquo; Thomas agrees, but adds that Stiles projects that sort of attractiveness, not because she is not as attractive as celebrities like Zeta-Jones, but because she &ldquo;doesn't choose that aesthetic for herself.&rdquo; He gives her agency over her star-body with that statement. Finally, it is important that the conversation and the comments within it are made both by people who know Stiles primarily by media coverage and professional reputation (Carolla and Pinsky), and by someone has worked with her on a film and, as such, knows her professionally and, at least to a certain extent, personally as well (Thomas). Therefore, the fact that there is commonality and synthesis between the two parties' views of Stiles says that her constructed star-body and her personal life share certain characteristics: approachability and a certain amount of control over her own public perception.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:

Things quickly take a turn for the comedic, however, when the host is interrupted by one of the show's regular cast members, who then proceeds to make light of either the project being promoted, the celebrity themselves, or some combination of both. In Stiles's case, the latter is true. After she begins the monologue by announcing that she is proud to be a part of the show's landmark 500<sup>th</sup> episode, Tracy Morgan (a male, African American cast member) joins her onstage, saying that he loved </span><i>Save the Last Dance</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">. Morgan then proceeds to try to convince Stiles to rendezvous with him after the show is over. He notices the studio audience and tells them that &ldquo;a black man gettin' together wit' a white lady...ain't no </span><i>show </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">(&ldquo;Julia Stiles' Monologue&rdquo;). When Stiles responds that they are, in fact, on a television show and that she was merely acting a part in a movie in which she played a woman in an interracial relationship, Morgan continues to try to convince her to meet him later, saying that, &ldquo;Once you go black, you </span><i>never </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">go back!&rdquo; and accusing her of having &ldquo;jungle fever.&rdquo; Stiles chides him for referring to &ldquo;a horrible stereotype,&rdquo; and then Morgan apologizes and asks her to dance. She still refuses, citing that she is &ldquo;a nineteen-year-old college student [whose] parents are watching,&rdquo; while he is married and has children. She then stage-whispers, &ldquo;I'll meet you at Twin Donuts after the show,&rdquo; they dance together, and Stiles ends the monologue by announcing that episode's musical guest, as is custom to the show's format </span><i>(</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">&ldquo;Julia Stiles' Monologue&rdquo;)</span><i>.</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> In this brief sketch, Stiles both makes light of and reaffirms her star-body. She self-identifies as both actress and college student, thereby pointing to her celebrity status and public association with academia, and differentiates between herself as a person and the roles she embodies, only to erase that distinction by the monologue's end. In doing so, she shows that she is conscious of the public's perception of her as well as comments that she is not self-important and does not take herself too seriously. By calling Morgan's exaggerated black patois and racial cliches stereotypical, she appears socially conscious. Again, the fact that he convinces her by the sketch's end does not negate that perception, but instead, makes it appear that while she is open-minded, she is not so politically correct that she is unable to joke around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">Also in 2001, Stiles continued acting the part of a woman in a controversial interracial relationship as well as took on another of Shakespeare's tragic heroines when she played Desi Brable in<i> O</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">, an adaptation of </span><i>Othello </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">set in Palmetto Grove Academy, a South Carolina prep school. It is an interesting coincidence that the name of the updated Desdemona character is a near-anagram of the word &ldquo;desirable,&rdquo; since Desi represents fulfillment of desire within the film. She is popular and beautiful, the daughter of the dean of the school, and girlfriend to Odin &ldquo;O&rdquo; James, Palmetto Grove's star basketball player. Other than Odin himself, Desi seems to be the only character within the film willing to question socially constructed norms regarding race, as in a scene near the film's beginning when, after Odin asks her to &ldquo;play black buck got loose in the big house&rdquo; while the two are in bed, they have a conversation regarding who is and is not allowed to use the word &ldquo;nigger&rdquo; (</span><i>O</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">). While Odin accepts his ability to employ racial slurs as innate to his condition as a black man, Desi sees this as problematic, and seeks to understand O's standpoint by having a conversation with him. None of the film's other characters question socially constructed norms in this way. While these script choices were doubtless made by someone other than Stiles herself, her enacting them adds to her star-body's association with forward thinking and the questioning of social norms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;line-height:200%""><u>Stiles' Star Body Part Three: Academics</u><o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">Stiles' final role requiring her to craft a modern interpretation of a classic Shakespearean heroine<a name=""sdfootnote2anc""></a><a href=""#sdfootnote2sym#sdfootnote2sym""><span style=""mso-bookmark:sdfootnote2anc""><span style=""font-size:7.0pt""><sup>2</sup></span></span></a> was as Ophelia in Michael Almereyda's <i>Hamlet</i><span style=""font-style:

As arguably the most well-known of the Shakespearean tragedies, </span><i>Hamlet </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">certainly has academic connotations. These connotations deepen when considering the involvement of Stiles specifically, as the film's release corresponds with her enrollment at Columbia University, where she eventually graduated with a Bachelor's degree in English Literature in 2005. In the film, Stiles's Ophelia is doomed from the start, as the first solo shot the audience sees of her is in front of a large waterfall. That immediately calls to mind Ophelia's eventual death by drowning. From that point on, most of Ophelia's scenes contain water of some form or another. One of them, in which Polonius brings her to Gertrude and Claudius to inform them of the concerns he has about her relationship with Hamlet (corresponding to Act 2 scene 2 of Shakespeare's play) even goes so far as to have Ophelia fantasize about drowning herself, as if to speed up what we as the audience know is inevitable (</span><i>Hamlet</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">). Because this continued theme is established at the same time Ophelia is established as an individual character with the first shot of her by herself onscreen, she is always already dead in the context of the film. Even Stiles' official fansite supports this reading, as its only comment about her involvement in the film is that she &ldquo;dies quite beautifully&rdquo; (&ldquo;Biography&rdquo;). Thus, even as Stiles is a modernized Ophelia who wears urban clothes and carries a messenger bag as she rides her bike through twenty-first century New York City, she is simultaneously a sort of &ldquo;everyophelia,&rdquo; going beyond her own performance of the character to instead represent what it is to embody that character, and, in so doing, reminding the audience that many others have played Ophelia before, and many more will likely follow after. In being associated with a performance that includes this kind of Postmodern metanarrative, Stiles's star-body developed a deeper signification of Academia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">While she has certainly broadened her repertoire in recent years to extend beyond the limits of teen films, Stiles' most recently-announced upcoming project - a filmic adaptation of Sylvia Plath's fictional autobiography<i> The Bell Jar - </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">builds on the aspects of her star-body that her earlier career helped establish. Stiles is reportedly playing the lead role of Esther Greenwood, Plath's fictional counterpart (</span><i>The Bell Jar</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">). According to her official fansite, Stiles herself co-optioned the film with indepent production company Plum Pictures, and will act as an executive producer (&ldquo;Biography&rdquo;). If true, this action seems to suggest not only that Stiles's star-body as socially conscious academic feminist is a fairly accurate one, but also that it is in keeping with the way she wishes to be publicly perceived of her own volition and because of values she wishes to support; not just as a marketable image or persona that fits what sells well at any given time.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;line-height:200%""><u>The Modesty Movement</u><o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">Julia Stiles is no longer primarily considered a teen actress by virtue either of her own age or that of the target audience of her more recent films; moreover, the type of teen identity that I have thus far examined as represented by Stiles and her ilk seems to have faded out of fashion at least somewhat in recent years. In contrast, the most current ideological trend in teen identity formation directly reacts against to the type of teen identity marked by Stiles' star body (one that signifies third-wave, sex positive feminist politics): the so-called &ldquo;new modesty movement&rdquo; (Shalit 1999). The most vocal champions of this movement by far have been Wendy Shalit and Laura Sessions Stepp. Both have published books that have come to represent the tenets of the modesty movement and its subscribers, with Shalit writing both <i>A Return to Modesty: Rediscovering the Lost Virtue</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> (1999) and </span><i>Girls Gone Mild: Young Women Reclaim Self-Respect and Claim It's Not Bad to Be Good</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> (2007) and Stepp writing </span><i>Unhooked: How Young Women Pursue Sex, Delay Love and Lose at Both</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> (2007). I will focus on Shalit's work in my examination rather than Stepp's because, while Stepp's book focuses on the preexisting &ldquo;hookup culture&rdquo; to which the modesty movement reacts, Shalit's work actually defines and explores the historical and sociopolitical roots of the modesty movement itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">First, the movement markets itself as a reactionary one. Shalit makes this clear in the titles of both of her books. By addressing a perceived need to &ldquo;return to modesty&rdquo; and &ldquo;rediscover&rdquo; it, Shalit implies that it was lost through some sort of wayward shift in mores, and that a cultural change is necessary to remedy this shift. She repeats that reactionary theme and focuses it on a particular part of contemporary culture she finds morally reprehensible in <i>Girls Gone Mild</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">. In order to understand the cultural commentary within that book's title (or, indeed, to write/perform it as Shalit did), one would have to have at least a passing familiarity with the </span><i>Girls Gone Wild </i><span style=""font-style:
normal"">video series, directed and marketed by Joseph R. Francis and boasting over seventy titles, most of them multivolume. by Vanessa Grigoriadias<b> </b></span>describes Francis and his company as follows in her article &ldquo;Wild Thing: Inside the Girls Gone Wild empire&rdquo; :<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:5.75pt;
margin-left:1.0in;line-height:200%"">Joe Francis has a gift. He can make more than half the girls he meets take their shirt off. He can make half of those girls take their panties off, too. He can make a straight-A student, prom queen, wife- and mother-to-be go outside a club with him, lift her skirt and show him the goods. All it takes, Francis has found, is a camcorder and one magic line: &quot;Do any of you girls want a T-shirt?&quot; The shirt is nice enough, a little white cotton tank with the logo of Francis' company stenciled on the front in red: girls gone wild. It's a brand that's become ubiquitous thanks to the late-night TV commercials selling the video series that Francis dreamed up. His company doesn't release sales figures, but it's been estimated that it sells 2 million tapes a year -- 2 million hour-long looks at naked college girls set to bad club music, costing anywhere from $9.99, to $29.99 for the wilder &quot;uncut&quot; versions (Grigoriadias).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;line-height:200%"">Though he has been investigated by the Federal Trade Commission no less than six times since 2000 for &ldquo;unfair and deceptive acts or practices and consumer redress,&rdquo; Francis himself frames his seemingly exploitative business venture in terms of empowerment and freedom of choice, saying that &ldquo;the girls don't need much convincing to do their part&rdquo; and &ldquo;To a lot of young women, it's titillating to break the taboo and all the more thrilling to think that millions of people might see them doing it&rdquo; (Grigoriadas). <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">It is this association of unlimited sex with empowerment that seems to concern Shalit and Stepp. Indeed, Shailit questions this association as it exists specifically within the Girls Gone Wild video series in the preface to Girls Gone Mild. First, she asks, &ldquo;What does liberation mean to you&rdquo;? (Shalit 2007 xi). Then, she addresses the problem of &ldquo;our Girls Gone Wild culture&rdquo; in a discussion of Debbie, <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:
200%"">who experiences regret after doing a 'scene' for a Girls Gone Wild video. Her regret was not that the producer, Joe Francis, has made millions by using girls like her, while all she got for disrobing was a t-shirt. Rather, Debbie was upset about 'not doing it right' when, for some reason beyond her grasp, she couldn't get excited during the proceedings. (Shalit 2007 xii) <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;line-height:200%"">Shalit concludes that the ultimate problem is that &ldquo;Debbie is publicly sexual while remaining utterly alienated from her own sexuality&rdquo; (Shalit 2007 xii). In this excerpt, Shalit seems to place the blame for this negative trend in female teen sexuality on &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; which, as a culprit, is nebulous at best. Upon further examination of the passage, it appears that Shalit also sees a problem with the girls' perceptions of appropriate sexual response/behavior (as made evident by the disbelief with which she imbues the section about Debbie's disappointment with herself for being unable to &ldquo;get excited during the proceedings&rdquo;), as well as with the marketing of these skewed perceptions, which serves to fill the pockets, not of the girls themselves, supposedly empowered and enacting their freedom of choice, but of Joe Francis and his staff&mdash;all of whom are male and required to sign a contract stating they will remain single as long as they are under his employment (<span style=""color:blue""><u>Gregoriadas</u></span>). Thus, the problem is that what is marketed as a liberating practice that allows girls to express their sexuality on their own terms actually functions as reinscribing a traditional mindset of patriarchal sexual control. In <i>Girls Gone Mild</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">, Shalit states that it is her aim to:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:
200%"">search for an alternative to our Girls Gone Wild culture. It's about finding a way to acknowledge sexuality without having to share it with strangers. It's about rediscovering our capacity for innocence, for wonder, and for being touched profoundly by others. My goal is not to attack those who want to be 'wild,' but rather to expand the range of options for young people, who I believe are suffering because of the limited choices available to them. (Shalit 2007 xii) <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;line-height:200%"">As a part of her desire to &ldquo;expand the range of options for young people,&rdquo; Shalit launched her website, ModestyZone.net, in 1996. ModestyZone claims that it is &ldquo;for good girls in hiding everywhere,&rdquo; and operates in conjunction with Modestly Yours, &ldquo;a group blog by women who value modesty in its various forms&rdquo; (<a href=""http://www.modestyzone.net/""><span style=""text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none"">ModestyZone</span></a>). <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">While Shalit certainly discusses a culture different from the one encouraged by Francis and his empire in her book, it is worth noting that the culture she encourages bears certain similarities to the one against which she claims to be reacting. First, Shalit must agree with Francis's assertion that the notion of social rebellion is inherently attractive to girls in their teens and early twenties, as both her webspaces frame modesty as the newest form of social rebellion through both their content and their layout. For example, one of ModestyZone's monthly features is the &ldquo;Rebel of the Month.&rdquo; In keeping with Shalit's characterization of modesty as being in direct opposition to the rebellion that typifies popular sexualized culture, the site claims that its rebels &ldquo;make [1950s icon of teen rebellion] James Dean look like a chipmunk&rdquo; (<a href=""http://www.ModestyZone.com/""><span style=""text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none"">ModestyZone</span></a>). The association of modesty and rebellion continues with an added dimension on Modestly Yours, where an animated sidebar contains an advertisement selling copies of <i>Girls Gone Mild</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">. In the first frame of the ad, the book's title is written in capital letters in shades of neon pink and green, with the final word backed by a flashing yellow shape that looks as if it is supposed to resemble an explosion. In the second frame, a picture of a copy of the book sits below neon pink, flashing type that tells the site's viewers to &ldquo;Be daring. Keep your shirt on&rdquo; (Modestly Yours). The colors, mock-exploding graphic, and text instructing the site's visitors to &ldquo;be daring&rdquo; in opposition to a culture that tells them they must take off their shirts in order to fit in and/or be thought desirable are obviously meant to present the modesty movement as avant-garde. Since the medium through which this message is being conveyed is advertisement, the notion of modesty becomes a commodity. Indeed, the online modesty movement relies upon commodity for its impact, with Shalit's webpages offering endorsements of and links to a number of websites that sell modest clothing, accessories, and swimwear. A few of the young entrepreneurs of these online businesses, such as Christa Taylor and Mary-Margaret Helma, have also been profiled as &ldquo;Rebels of the Month&rdquo; (ModestyZone)<a style=""mso-footnote-id:
ftn2"" href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span style=""mso-special-character:footnote"">[2]</span></span></a>. This specific commercialization of alternative femininity seems necessary in a capitalist society, because these young women and others like them are using their personal talents and resources to fill what they see as a void left by the larger fashion establishment. Much more disturbing, however, are the products approved by Shalit in the ModestyZone store. These products are not filling a perceived cultural need like the ones designed and marketed by modesty-minded clothiers, but instead, seem to serve as a forum for Shalit (and her designers?) to comment on the evils of contemporary culture and to enforce her viewpoint with the help of antiquated gender stereotypes. For example, the website's unofficial mascot appears to be a cartoon cow named Bessy, who appears on several of the items for sale in the ModestyZone store. The fact that the modesty movement is a culturally reactionary one is made evident yet again by t-shirt designs featuring a blushing Bessy bending over to place her hands over the place where her udders would be, were they visible. Above her, a caption reads, &ldquo;got modesty?&rdquo; (ModestyZone). This design combines a fairly harmless cultural signifier with one that is much less so. First, the lowercase lettering and design of the caption is obviously meant to recall the popular &ldquo;got milk?&rdquo; campaign of the mid- to late 1990s. The harmful cultural signifier appears when the metaphor of milk and cows is applied to the site's target audience of young girls to arrive at the antiquated pro-virginity maxim &ldquo;Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?&rdquo; When read this way, the site's products do not empower young women to rebel modestly, but instead, they reinforce norms of patriarchal sexual control while making these young women think they are going against the status quo. Indeed, many women who self-identify as third wave feminists see the proponents of the Modesty Movement as &ldquo;feminists who aren't,&rdquo; as Julie Craig labels them in her article &ldquo;I Can't Believe It's Not Feminism!&rdquo; (Craig 116). In it, Craig criticizes Shalit and her supporters for benefiting from the gains hard won by their feminist foremothers while still encouraging a life lived under patriarchal control -- &ldquo;a have-my-cake-and-eat-it-too whine that few realistic feminists have the time or patience to indulge&rdquo; (Craig 124).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%"">With both parties claiming female empowerment as their goal and saying that the other camp is operating under delusions of false control, with whom should their shared target audience (and society at large) agree? It is possible that that is not the right question at all. Consider, for example, Randall Patterson's article &ldquo;Students of Virginity,&rdquo; in which he interviews Janie Fredell, a Harvard University senior and a member of the student virginity club True Love Revolution (TLR). In the article, Fredell (who has garnered no shortage of praise from the contributors at Modestly Yours for her openness about her commitment to virginity) explains that she decided to join TLR after one of their socials was ridiculed in <i>The Harvard Crimson</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">, Harvard's student newspaper. Fredell says she was motivated to respond with an editorial because she believes &ldquo;it takes a strong woman to be a virgin&rdquo; (Patterson). After that editorial was published in </span><i>The Crimson</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">, Fredell gained notoriety on campus, which soon spread across the country as the story got picked up by other media sources, ultimately culminating in the event Patterson recounts as the conclusion to his article: a debate between Fredell and Lena Chen, a fellow Harvard student who is also a campus sex blogger (Patterson). According to Patterson, both Fredell and Chen are poised and articulate in the debate itself. Each espouses the desire for female empowerment, and though they differ in the ways they think that empowerment should be arrived upon, the women agree to respectfully disagree (Patterson). Given that both women seem to have acted with maturity and intelligence during the debate, Patterson's respective descriptions of them are disturbing. He meets the women for lunch when he conducts their interviews, and describes Chen as &ldquo;a small Asian woman in a miniskirt and stilettos who ate every crumb of everything, including a ginger cake with cream-cheese frosting and raspberry compote,&rdquo; while Fredell, &ldquo;when the dessert menu came, paused at the prospect of a 'chocolate explosion,' said, 'I may as well &mdash; I mean, carpe diem, right?' And then reconsidered &mdash; she really wasn&rsquo;t that hungry&rdquo; (Patterson). Here, Patterson delivers descriptions of the women's eating habits with an implied nod to their respective sexual attitudes: Chen, liberated sex blogger, eats &ldquo;every crumb of everything&rdquo; including a dessert, while Fredell, self-flagellating virgin, denies herself the dessert she really wants, which interestingly contains the word &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; in its name, no doubt causing the reader to connect this to the other kind of &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; Fredell regularly denies herself. Despite the fact that both women cite a common goal and treat one another with respect, Patterson's tongue-in-cheek, and I would argue, patronizing, conclusion insists on leaving a binarily-opposed image of them, thereby forcing his readers to choose to side with either the madonna or the whore and leaving them no middle ground for mutual respect. It is this attitude that causes me to question the root of the current divide between two camps of young feminists. Perhaps the problem is not that it is impossible for them to get along. Perhaps the problem is that it is of the best interests of the patriarchal media machine to keep one side from ever calmly relating to the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" align=""center"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-align:center;

More specifically, I will examine the way these intersections have an impact upon contemporary teen culture through celebrity influence on teen identity formation. I will focus on celebrities who have worked in a specific genre of teen films: the so-called &ldquo;Shakesteen&rdquo; films dominant in the late 1990s and early 2000s. While the bulk of this thesis concerns problems that I see regarding pop-cultural representations of teen feminism in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, the chronologically reactive nature of conflicting feminisms within the larger movement means that I must briefly summarize feminism's major ideological shifts over time, or &ldquo;waves,&rdquo; as they are commonly known. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"">American first wave feminism occurred from approximately 1848-1920, is widely thought to have originated with the (primarily female) proponents of the abolition movement, and held women's suffrage as its primary goal. Famous American first-wave feminists include Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Alice Paul, all of whom were present at the presentation and signing of the <i>Declaration of Sentiments</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> at the Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, New York on July 28, 1848. This declaration sought to point out the sexism inherent within the documents thought to be the cornerstones of American civil liberties. It did so by appropriating similar rhetoric and language found within these national texts but including women within the groups of people that received the rights bestowed by them. For example, the </span><i>Declaration of Sentiments </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">turns the following, otherwise familiar, passage from the </span><i>Declaration of </i><span style=""font-style:normal"">Independence from a critique of British tyranny to one of American sexism with the addition of only two words:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%"">We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men <i>and women</i><span style=""font-style:normal""> are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it, and to insist upon the institution of a new government.... (Stanton 71, emphasis mine) <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;line-height:200%"">By appropriating familiar sentiments typically lauded for their liberating qualities in a way that expressed the latent oppression these sentiments enforced on American women, first-wave feminists set a precedent of protests that subsequent generations of feminism would continue to follow, even over a century later. Cady-Stanton and her peers expressed something historical or familiar in an unfamiliar way, and, in doing so, brought attention to a more contemporary sociopolitical issue. Many critics of this first-wave movement claimed that its proponents were neglecting their natural femininity in trying to enter into what had been a traditionally male sphere of influence.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"">Later in the twentieth century, second wave feminists built upon the achievements of first-wavers by extending the presence of women in the public sphere first established by their enfranchisement in 1920. Second wave feminists worked to use these broad political rights to obtain rights that seemed closer to where and how women lived their lives day to day: within their marriages, as they raised their families, and in the workplace. Second wave feminism is typically thought to have begun with the widespread entry of women into the workforce during and after World War II. This phenomenon so fundamentally changed the structure of the American family's everyday routine that, after the war ended and many women were told to give up their jobs and return to their homes, they became dissatisfied about the role(s) their society expected them to fill. Out of this dissatisfaction, many women also became depressed and were subsequently diagnosed with the vaguely defined and rarely discussed &ldquo;housewives' syndrome,&rdquo; which Betty Friedan called &ldquo;the problem that has no name&rdquo; in her landmark 1963 book <i>The Feminine Mystique</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">. In it, Friedan recounts observations and anecdotes collected from informal gatherings of women whose primary job was to care for their husbands, children, and homes. A shocking number of these women, Friedan writes, felt unsatisfied:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%"">As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night&mdash;she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question&mdash;Is this all? (Friedan 198) <o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"">Part of the groundbreaking nature of this text, I would argue, lies in the locus of the blame for this nameless problem, which, according to Friedan, appears to be an ideological shortcoming perpetrated by American society at large: she writes that unspecified &ldquo;experts&rdquo; peddle the myth of &ldquo;true feminine fulfillment&rdquo; that tells women they must &ldquo;[pity] the neurotic, unfeminine, unhappy women who [want] to be poets or physicists or presidents,&rdquo; and instead, focus their energy on maintaining their families and homes exclusively (Friedan 198). This rigid definition of the appropriate female role, Friedan writes, has become &ldquo;the cherished and self-perpetuating core of contemporary American culture&rdquo; (Friedan 199). By identifying a widespread problem whose roots permeated a culture that prided itself on promoting an image of contentment born of progress, Friedan caused many Americans to question whether the things that their world told them should make them happy really did so at all. Like the first wave feminists, Friedan took an idea that was familiar to most (the outwardly-happy, busy American housewife taking care of her family) and added an unfamiliar dimension to it (the issue of female dissatisfaction and depression) in order to call attention what she saw as a pressing sociopolitical issue. In an effort to bring this issue to the broader public consciousness, Friedan founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966. Friedan became the organization's founding copresident, along with Pauli Murray, a law professor at Yale and a member of the President's Commission on the Status of Women, who, as one of the only African American members, was dissatisfied with the way commission's efforts failed to recognize that all women did not experience oppression of the same type or in the same ways (<i>The Founding of NOW</i><span style=""font-style:normal"">). In addition to raising awareness about the need for gender equality as a national, wide-reaching goal by lobbying for legislation such as the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) and legislation that allowed women access to safe, affordable methods of birth control, second wave feminists made it clear that, in their vision of a better world for women, every woman should have a voice, and, as such, what was important in any given woman's daily life was important not to her alone, but instead, had a broader meaning, and should be thought of as politically significant. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"">Many second wave feminists adopted the slogan &ldquo;The personal is political&rdquo; as a battle cry for the movement. Carol Hanisch coined this phrase in her essay of the same name, originally published as a part of the compilation<i> <span style=""color:black"">Notes from the Second Year: Women's Liberation in 1970</span></i><span style=""color:black;font-style:normal"">. While this phrase was widely accepted as one of near-universal significance by a majority of the movement's members, there was a degree of dissent regarding the application of the statement within the movement itself because of the way &ldquo;the personal&rdquo; differed across lines of race, class, and sexual orientation. Indeed, many critics of the second-wave noted that, for many of its members, the rights of &ldquo;women&rdquo; were often understood to be the rights of white, heterosexual, middle to upper-class women specifically, and many of the public faces of the second wave seemed to be ignorant to the fact that some of the &ldquo;rights&rdquo; or &ldquo;privileges&rdquo; they were fighting for were defined differently for women of other races or classes. For example, while prominent second wave voices like Friedan and Gloria Steinem spoke out about the right of women to be able to hold jobs outside of the home, many low-income women protested the exclusion of their specific interests. Because of the unfortunate intersections of race, class, and economic privilege, most of these women were African American and had seen working outside of the home not as a privilege to be won, but as a reality necessary for the survival of themselves and their families.</span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%""><span style=""color:black"">Third wave feminism (typically thought to begin in the early 1980s and extend through the new millennium) pushed the second wave notion of the political nature of personal life in new directions. While &ldquo;the personal&rdquo; still referred to those issue important to the ways in which individual women lived out their everyday routines, more aspects of the personal became accepted forums for political expression. Popular culture was chief among the new areas of third wave activism, with the arrival of bands such as Bikini Kill on the cultural scene signaling the birth of so-called &ldquo;riot grrrl&rdquo; culture, an arena in which girls could express their dissatisfaction with a culture in which they felt oppressed and ignored by combining traditional forums of creative self-expression like music, art, and theatre with the political ideals important to them. Bikini Kill's &ldquo;Riot Grrl Philosophy&rdquo; has this to say about the importance of popular culture within political expression for young females:</span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%""><span style=""color:black"">Doing/reading/seeing/hearing cool things that validate and challenge us can help us gain the strength and sense of community that we need in order to figure out how bullshit like racism, able-bodyism, ageism, speciesism, classism, thinism, sexism, anti-semitism, and heterosexism figures in our own lives. (Bikini Kill 532)</span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%""><span style=""color:black"">In addition to forwarding the idea that popular culture is a valid avenue for one's political beliefs, third wave feminists also extended the idea of &ldquo;the personal&rdquo; by examining and commenting on female sexuality in new ways. While previous waves of feminism mainly viewed the female body as a political space that had heretofore been unfairly controlled by legislators as in disputes over reproductive rights and the relative abilities of women in the workforce, third-wavers saw the politicians working to enforce those laws as merely a small, more visible portion of a pervasive, ideologically oppressive patriarchal system. As they saw it, the way to undermine this system was to dismantle it from the inside out by adopting its oppressive tools--such as insults about women's sexuality--and reclaiming them in a way that brought to light the everyday inequalities of sex and gender present in contemporary American society. Third wave feminists sough to regain control over as well as change the cultural meaning of these sexist insults. Many publications with this reclamation effort as their main goal appeared in the late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, Inga Muscio's <i>Cunt</i></span><span style=""color:black"">, Leora Tanenbaum's <i>Slut!: Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation</i></span><span style=""color:black"">, and <i>Bitch Magazine</i></span><span style=""color:black"">, edited by Andi Zeisler and Lisa Jervis. </span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%""><span style=""color:black"">A related effort sought to reclaim not only words, but also actions. Since language comparing women to objects or animals has at its root a desire to control women's bodies in some way, women of the third wave sought to own their sexualities. In order to do this, they first had to dispel notions of female sexuality as wholly receptive and passive, and many felt that a change in viewpoint toward young female sexuality was necessary. While traditional views of this type of sexuality had been that it was to be discouraged; that young women were vulnerable to sexual attack; are likely to be taken advantage of by someone older; and that women, therefore, should be protected, many third wave feminists felt that this view of their sexuality wrested control of their bodies away from themselves and relocated this control to the norm-constructing patriarchy. These third-wavers viewed their sexuality not as something to be sheltered and protected by outside parties, but as something they could use and enjoy themselves as they saw fit. For this reason, third wave feminists are often also called &ldquo;sex-positive&rdquo; feminists.</span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%""><span style=""color:black"">While many young women report that sex-positive third wave politics has resulted in a sort of liberation for them, there are others who view the sex-positive movement as a clever ruse of the patriarchy disguised as advancement for women<a style=""mso-footnote-id:ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""" href=""#_ftn1""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span style=""mso-special-character:footnote"">[1]</span></span></a>. One of these women is Wendy Shalit, author of <i>Girls Gone Mild: Young Women Reclaim Self-Respect and Claim It's Not Bad to Be Good</i></span><span style=""color:black""> (2007), and widely-accepted founder of the contemporary modesty movement that she frames as &ldquo;feminism's (mild) fourth wave&rdquo; (Shalit 204). In an age when abstinence-only education is federally funded and more and more fathers across America are accompanying their young daughters to &ldquo;purity balls&rdquo; that encourage them to maintain their virginity until marriage, this conservative reaction to third wave values is not altogether surprising<a name=""sdfootnote1anc""></a><a href=""#sdfootnote1sym#sdfootnote1sym""><span style=""mso-bookmark:sdfootnote1anc""><span style=""font-size:7.0pt""><sup>1</sup></span></span></a>. Though more traditional feminists question labeling this movement feminism at all, I would argue that its emphasis on choice and personal agency hearkens back to the feminist movement's origins, and that making the validity of its feminism determine its success overlooks larger cultural questions that should be addressed. If this movement is to be viewed implausible or unsuccessful, I would argue that that is the case not because modesty supporters employ faux feminism, but because they rely on commodified, reductionist cultural artifacts as the means by which they react to the third wave. For example, in <i>Girls Gone Mild</i></span><span style=""color:black"">, Shalit uses such forms as the recipe and the teen magazine-inspired personality quiz to promote modesty. Both of these easily-produced formulas rely on opposing stereotypes of young women (the sheltered aspiring homemaker and the vapid, self-obsessed reader of publications like <i>Glamour </i></span><span style=""color:black"">or<i> Cosmopolitan</i></span><span style=""color:black"">), and therefore, neither is the way to constructively direct her message to teen girls.</span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%""><span style=""color:black"">As I suggested earlier, third wave feminism brought politics to popular culture. The body of this thesis will examine the feminism employed in a specialized niche of pop culture: films that adapt the plots of Shakespearean plays for a target audience of American teens, also called &ldquo;Shakesteen&rdquo; films. Given feminism's penchant for adaptation of the established, I believe that these kind of popular cultural adaptations are the most appropriate lens through which to examine widely-held views of young feminism. I will examine not only how the changes that these adaptations make in areas of plot and character reflect then-contemporary views on young feminism, but I will also examine two of the celebrities whose careers were established or furthered due to their involvement in Shakesteen </span>film: Julia Stiles and Amanda Bynes. In my discussion of Stiles and Bynes, I will consider both the roles they played in Shakesteen films and their larger roles as celebrities whose actions influence their female teen audiences. Taken together, these things compose the women's &ldquo;star-bodies,&rdquo; defined by Angela Keam (who also coined the term &ldquo;Shakesteen&rdquo;) as a blending of the &ldquo;professional and corporeal&rdquo; associations of a particular celebrity to produce an overall public perception of that person (Keam 2).<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%"">Finally, after examining trends that have occurred thus far in representations of young feminism in popular culture, I will explore the future of young feminism in popular culture. Is it possible to widely and palatably market a movement that is so tailored to its participants' individual emotional and political sensibilities without some how compromising the spirit of the movement itself?<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" align=""center"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-align:center;line-height:200%"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" align=""center"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-align:center;line-height:200%"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" align=""center"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-align:center;line-height:200%"">&nbsp;</p></lj-cut></p></div>"

Feminists just want to be alone (boo-hoo)
Feminists spread vicious lies and rumor
They have a tumor on their funny bone

They say child molestation isn't funny
Rape and degradation's just a crime (lighten up, ladies)
Rampant prostitution, sex for money (what's wrong with that)
Can't these chicks do anything but whine

Dance break
Woo-hoo
(Take it off)

They say cheap objectification isn't witty, it's hot
Equal work and wages worth the fight (sing us a new one)
On demand abortion, every city (okay, but no gun control)
Won't these women ever get a life

Feminists don't have a sense of humor (poor Hilary)
Feminists and vegetarians
Feminists spread vicious lies and rumor
They're far too sensitive to ever be a ham
That's why these feminists just need to find a man

"event","I just got off the phone with my grandmother, who spent most of the conversation talking to me as  if I were my mother and calling my fiancee my father's name. I realize that she's almost eighty, and people tend to start confusing stuff when they're that age. Rationally, I know this. That doesn't make it any easier to deal with emotionally. I just keep thinking that there's no way she's going to make it to see me get married, and that hurts more than I know what to do with. I love my grandmother, but most of the time, she drives me fucking crazy. She expects me to still be the sweet, pure little girl I used to be, and any time I express a change in ideology or action, she closes off. I know that some of that is generational and that I should probably cut her some slack, but mostly it makes me feel like a disappointment and a failure and I hate that. Despite it all, her not being at my wedding seems unthinkable.

Maybe it's not about her at all. Anthony Rapp tells a story in his memoirs about being at lunch with an ex-boyfriend of his while trying to deal with a mutual friend's death. When Anthony asks his ex how to deal with the grief, he responds by reminding Anthony that mourning is two-fold: you mourn the loss of the person you loved, sure, but you also mourn the loss of that person's vision of who you are, because that facet of you cannot exist without them. That explanation struck a chord with me the first time I read it, and it seems closer and scarier to me now. I'll certainly miss my grandmother when she finally passes away. She's always supported and encouraged me, even as she makes me angry. I think what I'll miss more, though, is the vision of myself as innocent and optimistic. I'm feeling jaded and overwhelmed by life more and more these days, and though that's probably just part of the natural process of aging and growth, sometimes I wish I could still be the sunny little girl I am in my grandmother's mind.

More on this later when I'm not crying in public, guys. Love to you all."

5. Sometimes I narrrate my life in my head.

6. I'm convinced stiletto heels are torture devices invented by the patriarchy. Seriously.

7.If the rumor is true and Hanson and SK6ers tour together, odds are steep that I will actually die of fangirl glee. So that's not terribly weird, but it is true. Anyone heard more about this rumor?"

"event","Hi everyone.
Sorry for being such an eljay stranger. My life has been such a whirlwind the past few weeks. I'm teaching a new class of kids that are really great, and I finally get to teach literature, which is fabulous. I'm insanely busy writing the thesis. Chapter one is done, and chapter two is due at the end of the week. I think I may actually graduate on time without harming myself or others. That is an exciting prospect. No word yet from my PhD apps. You'll hear when I do.

Also, M and I have now been together a little over two months, and everything is wonderful. He's smart and funny and considerate and supportive, and I'm definitely in love for the first time. So last night was our first Valentine's Day. He brought me a bouquet of pink tulips, and we went out to dinner and then back to his place. We agreed not to to do real gifts. I got him a card and he got me a Ring Pop because of a prior discussion about candy we loved as kids. He even helped me put it on my hand. Was adorable. I've totally turned into one of those schmoopy, sentimental girls I always used to mock, and I totally don't even care.

I need to turn in now, guys. Comment and tell me about your lives as of late."

1. Vanderbilt
2. Boston College
3. UMich Ann Arbor
4. UC Davis
5. CU Boulder

I'm sure things will be crossed off in a few months once rejection letters start (because they'll inevitably arrive before the acceptance(s), of course). I'll keep you all posted. 

I'm flying home to the parents' tomorrow morning. Am super stoked about home-cooked food and getting to see everyone. Other exciting news: I started seeing this guy about 3 weeks ago, and he's officially asked me to ""go steady."" Yes, he actually said that. Cute, no? I'm absolutely exhausted right now because we talked for SEVEN HOURS STRAIGHT on the phone last night. SEVEN. I've never felt this way before, guys, and it's strangely wonderful. We're so silly and cute, but he's also amazingly intelligent, which is of course very important to me. We made each other mix CDs for Christmas (I know, I'm a geek, but he is too, so it's okay) and I put a Hanson song on his and he liked it. It was ""A Song to Sing,"" in case you're wondering, Margaret, Jessica, and Ella. Gah. I'm gonna stop before I explode and spray rainbows and sunshine everywhere.

Have a great holidays, guys. Have fun and be safe, and I'll check in again soon."

"event","Hi all!<br />As usual, I'm crazy busy and doing about 45756854 things simultaneously. I had a meeting with my thesis adviser this morning while we were both working a table to support a petition to our University president becoming aware of the need for childcare on campus. So we're going over my thesis prospectus and talking about PhD applications while telling people to sign our petition and while she's nursing her baby, right in the middle of the student union plaza. It was really kind of amazing, and she said something like ""This is what being a female academic is about...being able to multitask."" And then she segways into my thesis on gender segregation in teen movie adaptations of Shakespeare. It was just awesome.<br /><br />Other updates: I'm still seeing the boy, I guess, and we've been out once since the last time I posted. He's asked me out twice more since then (makes me feel special) but I'm genuinely busy and my schedule is nuts. He even gave me a present, a book he said made him think of me. That made me go all gooey inside. It's all very confusing and I feel like I'm slowly becoming that girl who rearranges her life just so she can see a boy. Hormones are evil things.<br /><br />Teaching is still insanely draining. I gave back my first set of essays and crushed their little hearts. It was depressing for all concerned, but here's hoping this next essay will go better. I've see some great drafts so far.<br /><br />Every weekend&nbsp; until the end of October is packed. This weekend, I'm going out with some girls from school on Friday and getting all pretty and dressed up <strike>and probably slightly drunk</strike>. After that is a conference at which I could possible get my academic future presented to me on a plate. Very nervous about this. This woman who I'd love to study under from my doctorate will be there, and though I'll probably just be pouring her coffee, that's still really awesome. My adviser knows her and has said she'll introduce me and chat about my&nbsp; thesis. Could be HUGE for me. After that is Hanson in St Pete, then Fall Break during which my favorite undergrad roommate is coming to visit, and then after that is SK6ers on Halloween. Hope I survive all this busy-ness. Drop me a comment and let me know what's going on in your lives, everyone. I've been a bit of an LJ stranger."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's that time of year again.&nbsp; The one where we empty pocketbooks and bank accounts&nbsp; and spend several days in questionable states of sanity and hygiene just to follow three silly Midwestern boys around the country. Now, I'm one of those fans who glories in saying that she's been there from the beginning. I bought three copies of Middle of Nowhere on CD because my brother was ""tired of listening to that girly shit"" and wanted to see what happened if you put a cd in the microwave. The Albertane Tour was my first concert ever. My mom drove some friends and me to crappy Lakewood Ampitheatre. We had lawn seats and the boys looked like ants. It was hot and crowded and overpriced. Taylor waved at a group of us through the fence afterwards, and I still remember the shirt he was wearing. That was almost ten years ago.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Now, half my life later, I, like many thousands of other fans, have grown. I've grown with the boys, through mergers and marriages and backlash and babies. Most importantly, I've grown without them. I've figured out what I want to do with my life and gotten a college degree. My family has seen death and birth. And now, I think I may be falling in love--really-- for the first time. I've lived, as much as it's possible to have lived at twenty-one.&nbsp; Why then, do I still need this music? It's not just a want, a hobby, something that makes me happy. It's a <i>need</i>, way down deep in my gut. A need so strong that I traveled fourteen hours one way in a car this summer with girls I'd only met a handful of times just to see them in their element. Just to be able to sit four hours on a sidewalk in the Oklahoma heat, listen to songs I could sing in my sleep (and have, by some reports), and squeak out three variations of ""Hi! You were amazing! Thank you so much for doing this for us!"". Not that it wasn't a fabulous experience. It was. The emotion in that Tulsa bar that day was so heavy and thick it was almost tangible. We had been there since day one, and we were hearing a real, heartfelt thank you for our time and our money and our defense of this band that so many had discounted as fluffy, silly, teen-idols-of-the-moment whose moment had long passed. It was totally worth it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />This fall is my first tour as a real adult with a job and responsibilities and people counting on me. It's work and it's hard and <i>how the hell do they expect me to get back home at 2am and to teach a class 6 hours later? Why are there so many shows in the middle of the week? </i>My solution? Drive 7 hours to St. Pete to catch the closest weekend show (Dear God PLEASE don't let there be a hurricane. PLEASE.), and maybe still go to Atlanta. Maybe. If I have the money for buses and cabs and tickets oh my. Why do I care so much? All they've ever given me is music, right? Just notes on a page transmitted through my radio or stereo or iPod. But it's been so much more than that. It's been ups and downs and anticipation and release and the best friends I'll ever have, even if I never meet them all in person. So I guess that's why. See you all on the road."

"event","Since the lovely Margaret asked for a report on how my teaching today went, it's time for a RL update. But first, a few random things:

* My mommy has a broken arm :( She randomly fell and hurt herself. She called me today all drugged out on pain meds, which was funnier than it should have been. Sad that she's hurt, though, and home by herself.

* I was watching that Paul Simon tribute thingy on PBS tonight while reading a book for class. It was pretty awesome (the tribute, sadly not the book) and I really want to see the whole thing. I saw the last Simon and Garfunkle reunion tour about 5 or so years ago. Was totally the youngest person there and that was totally okay cause it kicked ass. Also on the subject of Paul Simon and his music, my boyfriend Isaac seriously needs to cover ""Late In The Evening,"" like RIGHT NOW. Would make me a very happy fangirl, yes indeed. I can hear him growling out the chorus. Would be so perfect.

* OMG BIG LOVE WAS FANTASTIC TONIGHT. Does anyone else on my flist watch that show? Craziness.

* And the last of the random, I got a package of cheese straws from my grandmother in the mail today. This pleases my tummy :)

* Okay, so the teaching today. I was nervous at first, I always get nervous, even though I've decided I really love the whole teaching thing and I think I'm fairly good at it for someone who's just starting out. I chose to teach class today (all the grad students are required to lead one class since it's a split course with undergrads too) because we covered the concepts that make up the core of my seminar paper for this class, so it was all material that I'd read before and know fairly well. I'm particularly passionate about the authors (Helene Cixous and Luce Irigaray) and their notions of writing as women and breaking away from patriarchal academic restrictions, so I was excited about sharing that with the class, as it were. There's this one other grad student who I know doesn't really like me or my friends in the class, so I was worried about her picking on me because she feels the need to do that to us on occasion. Like, last week, when we has the first all-grad class meeting, she deliberately sat at the complete other end of the table from us. Anyway, she tried to start some argument today, the basis of which was that she didn't like the theory we were discussing, therefore, it must be wrong. I deflected her ""argument"" fairly quickly, but it was a bit nerve-wracking. Anyway, the class seemed to understand the important points when it was over, so it went well overall. Thanks for your good thoughts, everyone.

My username comes from the Emily Dickinson poem ""Tell all the truth and tell it slant,"" the entirety of which follows:

Tell all the Truth but tell it slant---
Success in Circuit lies
Too bright for our infirm Delight
The Truth's superb surprise
As Lightening to the Children eased
With explanation kind
The Truth must dazzle gradually
Or every man be blind---

Dickinson was my first-ever favorite poet (I was a bit of a twisted twelve-year-old, to be sure), and this poem has always struck me as simultaneously simple and complex, harsh and beautiful. Even though I've always loved it, the poem took on a more personal meaning in college, when  the professor who remains my favorite, even five years and dozens of instructors later, used it to explain the goal of a good paper. Our purpose as writers, he said, was to argue our version of truth in such a way--with such a slant--that our audience would be overtaken with the argument bit by bit and be with us by the end. I was immediately enraptured by the notion of myself as a purveyor of a certain kind of truth, however small it may be, and having that power still excites me to a degree. 

Now, as I'm older and at a slightly different place in my life, the poem has taken on a few more shades. First, it serves as a sort of representation of Dickinson herself and the things she stands for in my mind: a sort of strong, sarcastic, observant femininity, the kind of woman who stands on her own two feet and has the ability to change the world without a man by her side. I'd love to be thought of in those terms, and it's definitely a quality that can be found in my other favorite female poets, Stevie Smith and Sylvia Plath. Incidentally, all three women were also suicidal and admitted to mental institutions at some point in their lives. Hmmm. Maybe I should be frightened...

Lastly, I'm completely in love with the comparison of truth to lightening. Not only are both dangerous and beautiful, they're cheapened if completely understood and therefore must be revealed gradually ""or every man be blind."" I've held on to that during some spiritually and emotionally trying times in which I wished I knew what was happening and why, and then realized that maybe not knowing how my life was going to play out was for the best.

Well, that's all, folks :) Tagging ten people would take up more than half of my f-list, so I'm just gonna leave this open to all. If you want to explain your username, feel free :)"

"event","General RL update post, I guess....
1. I had a pretty fantabulous weekend. One of my oldest friends came to visit me, and I really needed that. As much as college and after is all about re-inventing and discovering yourself, there's something to be said about being able to connect with someone who punched a kid in Kindergarten for breaking your good crayons (true story, btw). So we generally just hung out and talked and watched Dawson's Creek on dvd, which was way more fun than I'm going to admit. It was a nice break from the craziness that is my life at present.

2. In addition to all of that, we went to see POTC3. Yes, world. I have finally seen this film. And it was okay. Not fabulous, though there were fabulous parts, a few of which I will list:
* Keith Freaking Richards, people. Playing guitar and being all ""I'm a really cool half-dead pirate, bow to my awesomeness,"" which is pretty much the perfect character for him anyway.

* With the addition of Chow Yun Fat to the cast, they may as well have subtitled the film ""Old Guys Victoria Really Wants to Sleep With, Minus the Sleeping."" Seriously, Keith Richards, Johnny Depp, Bill Nighy, Geoffery Rush. Was there even dialogue in this film, cause I didn't notice. Was too busy staring at all teh sex.

* As much as I think Keira Knightley needs to be force-fed a sandwich and then smacked in the face, my inner feminist rejoiced at a female pirate king who got to kick major ass.

*My one bad thing (besides the lacking Calypso plot thread, which could've been really cool had they seen it through properly):

FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND PURE, WILL TURNER, WHY ARE YOU NOT DEAD? Do we need more Orli in an artfully ripped shirt, really? No. But I'm sure we'll get some piece of crap about their son and how he carries on the Turner Pirate Legacy or something. And was it just me, or did that kid look just like the kid that got hanged in the beginning? I'm such a cynical wench.

Gotta go to class, guys. Will edit and add to this later. Smooches!"

Jon McLaughlin opened for SK and the boys on several stops of the ""2007 Minutes in Heaven Tour,"" and he released his debut album, ""Indiana,"" earlier this month. It. is. amazing. And introspective and soulful and beautiful. Check out a few tracks at his site, guys:

"event","So I'm completely addicted to the show Supernatural now, and, thanks to a lovely new YouTube friend, have been watching back episodes of season 2 today instead of doing my German homework.

Sidenote: MADE A 93 and A 94 ON FIRST TWO EXAMS CAUSE I RULE THE WORLD. and am apparently the best guesser ever. whatevs.

Okay, back to the Supernatural awesomeness. So the show revolves around these two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester, whose mother was killed by a demon when they were young. Ever since, the boys and their father have been hunting the thing that killed her. Sam rebels against the abnormal life he's forced into by going to Stanford, and he and Dean don't speak for 2 years until Dean shows up and says that their Dad is missing from a hunting trp and they need to go find him. So Sam is going to go  for the weekend and then go back to his normal life and his gorgeous girlfriend, Jessica. So the boys hunt and kill an undead beastie, and Sam goes home, only to find that Jessica has been killed the same way as his mother. That's basically the pilot episode. Then he joins Dean in the family business for good and the boys basically kill a different demon/ghost/monster/vengeful spirit every week, and it's awesome for two reasons other than the aforementioned basic plot:
One: Sam and Dean look like this:

In case they look familiar, that's Jared Padalecki (""Gilmore Girls"") as Sam and Jensen Ackles (""Dark Angel"" and ""Smallville"") as Dean. Yummy, right? Yeah.

Two: Sam and Dean drive this:

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/slant_truth/pic/00003aft/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/slant_truth/pic/00003aft/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""230"" border='0'/></a>

That's a '67 Chevy Impala, kiddies. Isn't she beautiful? I almost have a bigger crush on the car than I do on Dean. Almost.

Must go do homework now. Ugh. Everybody watch the reruns of season 2 on the CW. Thursday at 9. EDIT: Reruns now air SUNDAYS at 9 on the CW!!! Keep an eye out, guys. You won't be disappointed."

"event","Gaaah. I have to write like a fiend today. Seriously. I did find out however, that one of my papers isn't due until after I'm back from Tulsa, so if I need to, I'll have 1.5 days to fine-tune it. I still have to write lots today. Must go the the SLC because I can't concentrate in my room.

Also have to check on my dad. He had surgery yesterday. I got home too late to call alst night, but my brother said he's doing fine.

Two squee-worthy things: 
* One Tree Hill tomorrow after a 2 month hiatus!
* TULSA IN 3 DAYS OHEMGEE!

EDIT : Happy May Day/Beltane, everyone! Girl power (in a very true, Spice Girl-less way)!"

Don't you hate it when people say they can't go do something (go to the theater) because they've got soooooo much to do (clean the barn for tomorrow's guests) and then procede to sit and stare into space for about 20 minutes.

So yeah, packed up and headed to Parsons and had a bonding moment with Mike and India and went to go see the new X-men.  India went under protest because it was ""too geeky"" but she has been successfully reprogramed.  Other than that I've been toodling around the house searching for my cell phone (that I discover a week later Mike had taken, sooo much stress!) repacking, given a couple ""real"" massages (ie I got paid), and making the social rounds.  I'm exhausted.  It's hot.  Looking forward to Iowa, but don't know if I have the energy reserves to do what I need to do there.  We shall see tomorrow."

I haven't had the best past couple of days.  I lost my drivers license.  Finished up my internship today without ever having actually given my supervisor a massage.  Weird.  Gave one to every other therapist (excluding the acupuncturist) except her.  

Anyway while speeding my way home on the backroads I got pulled over.  I always get tickets.  But today I got a warning.  I had expired insurance, no drivers license, and bright pink hair and I got a warning.  How on earth does that work?  Very mysterious"

I know a lot of people who didn't like it, or found it mildy disappointing, but I'm not one of them. I'm amazed at how much story they fit into one movie.  It was a whole novels worth.  Love the scrapbook with accompaning mix cds.  I'm now motivated to take the long road trip to Iowa avoiding I-35.  It'll probably one of the last times in my life I will be free to just pick up and drive solo.  If only Jack were a better traveler, since he needs to arrive in Iowa with me.

"event","So at 11:45 pm I was driving home from work where I'd had to beat men off me with a stick (almost literally), having had at least two proposals to elope to tropical places, and so was feeling pretty good about the world.  Okay so driving, all green lights. Yay!  turn on the radio and turn up the cool edgy dischordant punk music, which continues for many good songs, turn on to the windy back road (Constitution) to my apartments,  there's this one single street light on, and it's flickering blue, mostly off, very Nochnoi Dozor, what with the huge orange moon on the opposite side of my car... I think ""How cool and worldly am I with my charm, zen massage career, this ambience, and a cool radio station""  and think a guitar riff splits the night and my ear drums and I turn the music down, turn onto well lit Oak Tree Avenue, and I realize....I'm in Oklahoma, this is a chrisian rock station, and I got hit on by a bunch of middle aged men who buy beer and lotto at Albertsons.  Sadness.  And now I can't find the song.... My love is like poetry, your love is like a magazine.... Oh well, at least it was a good moment."

"event","Today is the anniversary of the May 3 tornado that blew away most of Oklahoma City, and we're under a tornado watch.  Sicko meteorologists almost sound gleeful.  Meteorology is something of an obsession here.  The meteorology majors even came up with a drinking game (I'll post it in a seperate blog, though you'll have to adapt it to your local station).  So, even though they've been warning impending doom since about 5 am, it has yet to even cloud over.  Nut jobs. 

I did venture out today, since Robin came over to visit the shutin if we could watch Lost, which we are both obsessed with, and I realized that we only had tap water in the house.  Norman tap water is supremely gross, full of arsenic.  So I put on my brave face and went to walmart (gah! food stamps day! so many awful people!) and picked up a flat of dasani (bit of a splurge, but nice) and then of course I had to pick up a Little Caesar's pizza...and then I was by Hobby Lobby....lol.  You know how it goes.

So Lost. OMG!  They didn't!  How could they?!?  Poor Hurley!!!!!!  I threw stuffed animals at the TV.  I'm going to die over the summer.

At Hobby Lobby, I bought a box to decorate and hide my *ahem* ""unmentionables"" in since I know when I move up to Iowa that my gram is a snopp.  Sigh.  And I bought a magazine that I'd been hunting high and low for called Lily.  It's a new magazine for ""beautiful living through faith"".  It's interesting.   Felt a bit wierd making those purchases together, lol.   I'm a little off put by the magazine....definately written by all those women that read the christian romance novels and always visit For All Bible in the Joplin Mall.  On the other hand, it's very nicely put together.  They have an amazing photographer, everything looks lovely in it.  I just don't like Joyce Meyer.  Maybe if they got Philip Yancey to write an article, he's more my style.  Anyway it's worth a flip through for all you theological types."

It's subsided a great deal, but still feel really achy.  I kindof knew I was getting sick, but thought I'm always slacking off to do fun things, and if I feel a little extra tired for no reason, well, I should keep on trucking and not be a slacker anymore.  Wrong.  Well not wrong.  Shouldn't be a slacker and run off for jaunts to the city or spend money I really can't afford at Borders on magazines in a language I can't even read, but when your body says slow down, you should listen to it.  Which is like total duh.  I'm a massage therapist, I'm always telling people to de-stress or they'll get sick.  Hah.  Damn I hate irony.  Oh well.  Hopefully said person I cancelled on isn't too upset.  She even offered to have me come in and give me a massage to help my headache (she's therapist too) but I know the kind of massage I need is the kind that makes grown men cry and right now, I think I might throw up.  I'd feel a million times better, but I'd throw up.  Anyway so yeah. I'm home today, slowing down, and going amish.  No electricity except maybe the microwave for some tea.  So if anybody wants a quiet sit down and some tea in the dark, come on over.  I'll be here.  Lurking.  mwahahahaha.  Er. yeah."

My horoscope profile according to Cainer... 
To be a Cancerian is to be blessed with an infallible inner radar screen. It is to care, passionately, about the people who matter to you and the causes that have meaning to you. It is to know, always, what must be done and why - and never to be wrong. Yet it is also to feel your best is never good enough, even though it certainly is. All you ever have to do, to be successful, is be yourself with a little more confidence."

It all started because I have to admit I love the country music they play at Toby Keith's place up in the city, and wanted to find out if he had made a playlist for my home listening pleasure.  And then I got sidetracked....as I am wont to do....

For instance, Russell Crowe like k.d. lang, Indigo Girls, Kate Bush, and David Bowie.  Which is not very kick ass for kick ass guy like Russel Crowe...although I do like the occasional David Bowie or Kate Bush song.  I think Russell Crowe may actually be a lesbian.

Bill Maher has the coolest playlist ever.  Flat out.  I don't normally watch him, but I may have to kidnap him and keep him in my closet for my own personal amusement/DJ.

Steven King listens to the Beach Boys, which I know will be approved of by certain denizens of Forest Pointe.  He also listens to Spoon, who I am developing a taste for. Mmmm yummy.

William Shatner listens to.....William Shatner.  And Eminem.

BTW, Toby Kieth doesn't have a playlist.

"event","An interesting few days.  I went to a church dinner with Denine, my boss from Albertsons.  It was one of those ""Women of Faith"" type meetings.  I met up with two other girls from work and we car pooled up to the city and the church, trying to be as blasphemous as possible en route to avoid being hit by lightening before the entire congregation, lol.  When we got there, we found out we were part of a group of 700 women (huge freaking oklahoma baptist church) all settled around a series of tightly packed round tables for dinner.  Oddly enough, they had felt that Denine, the one person we knew, should not host our table, but one seperated from us by a large grey wall.  The woman who hosted ours looked like Alexandra Stoddard.  It was scary.  The first thing she asked us was if we were ""married or single ladies"".  We are all very very single, she stated she was married, and from then one conversation with our hostess was limited to asking for the peach juice sweetened tea.  Luckily we were seperated from her and the one other (luckily chatty) guest at the table by a rather large floral arrangement.  We then ate dinner, but then had to wait while someone came around to help each table pray before we ate dessert.  Mmmm hmmm, coming between a horde of women and chocolate cake.  Not wise.  We were going to sneak out (700 people, who would miss 3?) before the speaker, but were cut off at the pass by a long lost Denine.  We like Denine, which is why we were there in the first place and couldn't say no.  So we went into the sanctuary.  Church ladies in flowy floral dresses stood up nd they sang.  At first normal songs, then wierd ones all about the pain of Christ.  We then went into a pasture with Jesus.  OK, not literally, but we got led in this little meditation and then a sermon on the only 4 major women in the bible that emphasized how Jesus and Mary Magdalene were NOT married.  Kaitlyn came back from the pasture and realized she wasn't wearing a belt. We debated for awhile if she was ever wearing a belt, or if she just left in the pasture.  Deep stuff.


I finished up clinics on the next day, and had a few are they really going to let me go minutes while I filled out my graduation paperwork.  They did let me go. (hurray) and finally finally got around to ordering my massage table, which I could have ordered 4 months into the program.  

Today I started my internship.  It's at a place called Pilates Plus.  They are actually pretty cool.  They have pilates, hatha and restorative yoga, acupuncture, and all kinds of massage.  I really like Susan, my internship head honcho/mentor thingy.  She's a middle aged lady, very soft spoken and conservative (ie normal) in appearance, but says things like ""groovy"" and calls me ""sister"" lol.

To celebrate not having a Glencliff (most horrible spa job known to man or womankind) style boss I went to The Earth, which is a little hole in the wall whole food place and stocked up on goodies to snack on since I'll be there over the lunch hour.  My kapha must be needing some balancing, 'cause I came out of there with chocolate covered ginger, extra spicy Reeds Ginger Beer, and joy of joys a Dagoba chocolate bar called xocolatl which is dark chocolate with chilis and nibs.  Mmmmm. Spicy."

We took him to the vet as soon as I got off work.  Apparentley he'd been hit by a car, though he's ok except for a gash on his hind leg.  So one week, $70, some kitty antibiotics, and some ointment later, my cat is home.  I'm really relieved.  I didn't even berate him like I did the strange cat I thought was him from a distance at the shelter.  Now instead of slaughtering a calf for his return home I think I'll thaw out my last piece of salmon.  Treble (Casey's non-escapee cat) isn't to sure about having to share attention again, but it's for his own good, 'cause he's waaaay clingy.  I think I stepped on him 4 times in the past week.

Your vivid emotions and imagination takes you away from this world
So much so that you tend to live in your head most of the time
You have great dreams and ambitions that could be the envy of all...
But for you, following through with your dreams is a bit difficult

You are charming, endearing, and people tend to love you.
Forgiving and tolerant, you see the world through rose colored glasses.
Underneath it all, you have a ton of passion that you hide from others.
Always hopeful, you tend to expect positive outcomes in your life.

"event","I went to the animal shelter today, which is conveniently located just across the highway from my apartments to see if the idiot cat had turned up there.  He's bob-tailed declawed twin was there, but he had tags that named him Bobbie.  Not very creative.  And then there was Jean.  I named him Jean, and I tried to pretend he was Jack, but I can't lie for crap, and Jean was picked up way the heck out there away from my place, so I got called on it.  I feel slightly wrong for trying to replace Jack, but Jean was a total sweetheart.  I didn't bring him home, though the nice animal control lady offered to send him with me (for a $55 adoption fee I'm sure), but he wasn't fixed, and I'm not bringing home a cat even less likely to stay home than his idiot counterpart.  Even if he did have amber colored eyes."

When I came home Casey told me he got trapped in her closet at some point and she let him out, so when I didn't see him I figured he was just pissed off about that and avoiding me.  I got a bit worried when he didn't come when I put food in the dish (aka the magical Jack summoning sound) last night, a little more so this morning.  I've checked all cabinets and closets, even upended the sofa in case he was trapped under it like some kind of kitty miner digging for pipe cleaners....but still no sign.  He's been a twirp and getting out lately, figured it was some sort of spring thing, I really don't mind him being outside, since I'd like a cat who could be a gardening companion, but if he's going to dissappear so completely, I maybe better scare him into being an indoor kitty....if he ever comes back.  Where oh where is my Crackers Jack?  I feel so pathetic, but he's my buddy and he lost his tags last week on a mini escapade into the outdoors.... We've got new neighbors moving in, I hope he hasn't run into their apartment and gotten trapped....heh, that'd be like him, hide until after dark and scare the bejabbers out of them by having a large black cat meowing in their bedroom at midnight."

I like Big Poppa E's  idea of taking 3 pictures each day and posting them.  I think it's a good creative exercise.  On the other hand I missed reading his everyday blogs that he discontinued.  He has a really interesting life involving poetry and the occasional fist fight.  I've also considered creating a laundry blog.  As you all know who have ever done laundry (if you don't it's time you learned for reals) something always falls out of the laundry basket on your way to or from the laundry room.  I thought it would be fun to post photos of the fallen piece of laundry and record the place and time it fell, as well as maybe a little garment history.  Casey asks if I realized I'd be posting pictures of my underwear on the internet like that should be a deterrent....as if ;-) Post your preference or be faced with dirty laundry!!!!!!! mwahahahahahahaha....ha."

Not anyone's fault, I had lots of offers and well wishes from all over, but I just holed up and went into bear mode, which is normally my friend Sara's gig :-) but I beat her to it this year.  Somethings I've realized is that you don't even realize you are depressed until you catch yourself at it, like catching your reflection in a store window.  It's also not something that you can twelve step.  Acknowledging your depression is not the first step to curing it.  I'm still not sure what does cure it.  I thought about going to a counsellor, but I don't really see what possible good talking about it would be if it really is a chemical imablance like the Prozac and Zoloft people say (and we should believe them right ;-)  Depression is not the flu either, if people do have bouts of depression like they have bouts with the flu, I think they really have seasonal affect disorder and they just need to spend the day in the park.  The flu lasts a week, depression seems to be one of those things that drags on for decades.  Maybe I'm just really antisocial.  But I've caught myself having a good time twice in the past month.  Woot!  It feels so good to smile.  Watched a Gilmorethon in pajamas with roomie Casey, and we ate cookie dough and brownie batter.  I suddenly realized I wasn't depressed when I thought of dipping pretzels in the brownie batter (ab fab btw) which you think would be contraindicative.  Guess I just gotta remember to lighten up.  Duh! Anyway gotta put in another movie, watching John Wayne die in Sands of Iwo Jima does not constitute a strong candidate for the new Cheery Indoctrination I'm putting myself through lol.  Ciao all, and hope you are all well.  I promise I'll contact everyone personally soon!"

I remember saying ""Duuuude"" alot, which is generally a good sign of enjoyment if not intelligence.  We went to see it Sunday at the biggest screen in Oklahoma, and it was worth the drive and extra fifty cents (though I think we scared Casey a wee bit)  Go forth and watch it, and then go home and pet your kitty and rename him Aslan, especially if he's ginger colored.
It was really really faithful to the book.  Like I can't think of anything they left out (though I haven't read it in years) and a lot of it came back to me as I was watching, like the dying bluebottle on the windowsill (still don't get the deeper meaning of that...anyway) and St. Nicholas.

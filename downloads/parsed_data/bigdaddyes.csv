Brandi made me a rebecca some drinks, they were really good. Then me, rebecca, and jeremy walked back to my room at the imperial palace, it was so far away. we got back before the second parade so we walked around somemore, then before the second parade started we went an stood by brandi... that parade sucked it always does.. After the second parade rebecca and jeremy were gonna leave, but rebecca called her mom and asked her an her mom had to talk to my aunt so she did and rebecca got to stay. I was glad cause i didnt wanna stand their by myself with out my friends. We got alot of stuff during the night parade.. rebecca got light up titties, and she got an unopened bag of beads.. then it started to rain alittle, but i didnt mind. Tuesday wore me out.. I was so tired when i went home.. i took a shower then called rebecca and talked to her for like 3 mins and then got off the phone with her and got a shower.

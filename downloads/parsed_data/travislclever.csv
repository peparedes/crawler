"event","Well, spent like all last week cleaning and organizing (which is like my favorite thing to do!) and am totally exhausted. I've been trying to find a job, but not luck yet...was sexually discriminated against friday for a receptionist position. Haha....

We all had a big yard sale saturday, made like 40 bucks. Had fun, got into a fight over an antique table. haha more fun.

Lucy and I had ... coffee and one gross almond croissant and a delish pan au chocolate. Chatted about everything and took a ride. Boston drivers....wow thats a little scary! She'd good, but she looked tired. Hope you get some rest soon! Was great seeing you luc!

I am seriously missing everyone from hammond. It gets weird cause I miss them, and I wanna go back so bad. Time for something new in my life...I'll figure it out soon.

Love everyone. Have a great day.

"event","Well,  I've spent the week doing manual labor around the neighborhood. Cut neighbors grass, helped Cassi move 3 pallets (500 each) of 2'X 4's(wood slats) to her backl yard. We had such a blast. It was fun, we had starbucks(YUM!!) and chatted and made fun of each other all day.

Spent tuesday shampooing rugs outside..nearly got sick from using freezing cold water. Made a run to starbucks again (YAY * 2!!) and had a vente mint mocha chip. Sat tuesday night with sore back and feet in cassi and keith's driveway listening to monster 80's CDs.

Went looking for storage spaces yesterday to store our basement stuff so we can fix the leak. Having a yard sale saturday to sell as much crap as I can so it won't be a huge storage bill. Had dinner with Kristy last night at Rams Head in Savage mill. Stopped by Bonaparte bakery(where I worked for 7 months) Lucy would appreciate that I flicked off jessica(manager)

Keith and I installed his new hard top for the Jeep wednesday night. Had fun. Hurt my back even more.

Cassi bought a new vacuum cleaner. I thanked jesus I can sleep in the afternoon now without hearing the ""Jet fighter next door""

Have a job interview today(11:30) for a general office position at Storch Woods reality.

Parents are doing great. Talked things out, and are considering counseling. Will go if they want me to.

Lucy, you're going to be here this weekend? COME SEE ME!!!!! Pool isn't closed yet!!

Okay, will be back later....wish me luck on my interview."

"event","Hey all....well, things are looking up for me. I have been looking for a job for about a week, and have gotten some pretty good offers from some companies. Century 21 is offering $12.50 hourly for an office assistant. I might take up the offer(If weekends off are added!)

My parents have been going through a tough time. My dad has two chemo treatments left(yay!), but it feels like he has been getting very grumpy and irritable lately. Sharon and Buddy came in saturday and JR and the kids came in friday night, and he blew a fuse sunday morning. He yelled at JR about using too much ice from the ice maker. JR left and said he wasn't coming back. Ever.

My mom got depressed because my dad doesn't want anybody around anymore, and my mom likes company and having laughter around. She has been sleeping alot and hasn't pressured me about a job anymore. 

It finally came out today, while waiting at MR.TIRE in laurel, that I told my mom she should just get a divorce. She thinks by acting depressed and mad that dad will change. I told her that with 150,000 dollars from selling the house, she could be happy for a long time. She was really mad and told me not to talk to her or she would leave and not come back.

So pursue's my dream of leaving home...now by choice and not force. I'll update more often, but it could get graphic and scary.

lol, keeping a happy outlook.

She said she didn't care if I had to live under a bridge or anything, that I just needed to leave if I wasn't employed. Wow. I'm seriously scared now...for real

Mom and I cleaned the house this morning, and we sat around listening to oldies on the radio for an hour until Gina came home. They all decided to go to play putt putt golf, and I went along but got soaked in the rain. We came home and had Taco Bell for dinner, and we sat around playing cards and such. School starts monday for the kids, so my mom is going back to driving the bus. I wonder what they will say about me not being ibn school or working? Haha be prepared anyone who knows me I might be needing a place to stay...

"event","I forgot to write in my update about my ass hole brother. His name is Carl Clever Jr, so we call him ""j-r"". He is married, for the second time, to a nice mexican woman named Melissa. She has two children from a previous marriage, Ashleigh, 13, and Tavis, 12. She and J-R had twins, Calvin and Keyaira, who are 5. J-R's first wife, Lori, had two children with him, Molly, 13 and Annie, 9. Anyways, J-R stops by our house most of the time because he is a commercial fisherman in Maine. My mom noticed, while helping them pack to leave one night, that J-R took some blankets from our house. She didn't say anything, but then finds out that he has been taking 2 to 3 blankets every time he is here!! We have an RV in our yard ( No, not like in west virginia, it is nice and we take care of it, it's actually quite nice) and my mom stores her quilts and blankets in it. He is such a mother f*****g ass hole son of a bitch person!!

Things are going okay. Dad had is chemo treatment today. Mom is starting a new bus run on monday, so she won't be home in the mornings and afternoons. I'm going to have to get a job before they kick me out, so thats what this coming week will consist of.

Painted our back deck. My cousin david from Virginia came up and helped us with it. He is staying till sunday. 

Got news today from lucy that everything is Okay in her area and that she is doing good. 

Cassi and Keith finally got their garage floor laid down. The cement company gave my dad an estimate for constructing a front patio in our front yard.

Well, so long bitches. Gotta go make cookies and pie...."

Hope everyone is doing okay. Lucy left today for college...well, at least I won't see her tomorrow so today is the last day I'll see her. After she left, I went to see Keith and Cassi's hole that exploded with water in their front yard. I was doing okay and came back inside, and I went in my room and there was the picture of lucy, jessica and me in NJ. I cried for 15 minutes in the bathroom with the fan on so no one could hear me. I even had to blow my nose like 50 million times...this cry has been building up forever.

I didn't really mean to cry, but lucy is like the most wonderful person I have met on the planet. She is my fashion police, my cooking critic, my holiday shopping guide, travel partner, music enthusiast, etc. She is so honest about everything. If I had on the most ugly shoes and they were from Payless, she would be the one to call me out. God I'm gonna miss her!!!!

I'm gonna go cry again now before I electrocute myself on the keyboard...

"event","Well, life has been okay for moi. I'm trying to avoid going to HCC as long as I can, but it looks like my parents might just hand cuff me and throw me in the wagon. I'm still looking for a job, haha, but I'm scared of whats going to happen when my mom goes back to work...she is a supervisor of transportation for HCPSS. Now I'm trying to help keep up the yard and the house and stuff, but it's not going to last too too long. JR and Melissa stopped by from their trip back from colorado. I'm hoping to maybe go back to chincoteague before the summer is over. 

Cassi and the boys are still at the beach, so I'm totally alone and have nothing here or no one to talk to. Brittany invited me to go to OBX with her but my mom and dad said no because I have no job, or money.....wow. I'm boring.

Uncle Jeff and aunt Hellen decided to stop by on the way back from NYC on friday and we all went to have pasta in Clarksville. Their kids, Kent and Angie are ok, but get nerve racking after a day. 

Lucy and Amber are going away to college. I wrote them both letters and told them that I loved them both and they are super great friends. I'll see Lucy when I go to Staunton, but Amber is another 3 hours away.
sad...

"event","Well, this coming week will mark my second month of having done nothing but stay at home all summer. I'm hoping to get a job at Hampton Inn or Comfort Inn so I can make a little money, but I don't want to start college yet. I guess it scares me because I see it as another life long situation that I will never get out of. I really did just pass my classes by being charming and nice to the teachers. I don't know how I managed to do that. Lucy hasn't called me in like a week. Kristy won't return my calls. Greg hasn't called me or talked to me online in two weeks. It feels like everyone who has been my friend has left. Oh well, life will go on. I've been hanging out with Cassi and Keith alot lately, so that has been fun. Oh, I forgot to tell you about my birthday(almost a month ago!!) My mom decides (god bless her) that we are going to buy my dad a new lawn mower for his birthday ( a while after mine) We went on that saturday morning( June 25 ) and we headed out to Lowes in Laurel. While on our way, my mom realizes that the bank doesn't open until 9:00 am so we head over to a garage sale to see whats there. When we got there, my sister (echh) sees a bedroom set for $400.00 that she HAS TO HAVE!! So, all day of my birthday we are setting up a bedroom set for my sister( which included headboard, footboard, dresser and mirror, two night stands and an amoir) ((SOLID OAK!!)) and we then head to have dinner at Hunan Manor at 5:00. Kristy picked me up at 6:30 for drinks at Red Robin, and the waiters sang to me. LoL, I had blue dye from the margarita umbrella all over my face! Then when I get home, I got nothing - no cake, no card, nothing. I MADE my own cake. Haha it was better than store bought. Then, my parents say ""Surprise!!"" and take me to Best Buy. I got an IPOD and the complete first season of ""I Love Lucy"" on DVD!! I am to lucky to have people like this in my life!! Hey to all my peeps out there reading this!! Love and kises, till later....

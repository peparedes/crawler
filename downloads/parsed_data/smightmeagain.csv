"event","My kitty died on Friday. Middle of the day, out of the blue, my favorite furry friend died. I am so sad without him. I keep thinking expecting him to come jump on my lap or be waiting in my room when I get out of the shower. I just keep remembering all those times he would come in my room and jump on my bed to wake me up by eating my hair, or when he would chase me around the house (it was our little game) and it makes me very sad and I start to cry again. Jenny did a good job of distracting me on Friday. And on Saturday, Jenny, Nicole, and Kristen were awesome but its when I'm by myself, or sitting on the couch that I can't forget that he's gone. I miss my little baby."

"event","So, I have been on the verge of a a panic attack all day today. I realize its stress from events at work, and everyone tells me that I have no reason to feel guilty or responsible for what happened. Despite the dramatic resolution to this event, and the happiness that everyone tells me I should feel, all I feel is anxious and panic. How can I fix this proverbial Pandora's box and make everyone happy again? 
In other, unrelated news, I have a crush on someone. I feel horrible about having a crush on someone amongst all the upheaval of the last few weeks but, dammit, I'm human. I think he might like me too. Also I would have never even thought about having a crush on this person if someone else had not mentioned suspicions he had that I liked this guy. Oh dear, is it the power of suggestion or do I really like this guy? Oh well, I'm sure I will fuck it up somehow. I always do."

"event","So I decided to finally christen this thing since its creation a few days ago. I guess I have really had nothing and too much to say at once to write anything worth reading. Today I offcially received the news that the tumult that has turned my life upside down for the last year...really much longer than that...has ended. Regina has been terminated and Bryan quit. I realize its stupid to let my life be so effected by my job, however, I spend most of my waking hours there and so it does effect my life substantially. Fuck me, this is supposed to make me happy. The drama that has made me miserable for the last 12 months is over. Fuck you, I have been crying about it for weeks now and now knowing the outcome has made today no exception. I broke out crying 3 times today at work. I don't do that and I felt like an asshole for doing it. I don't feel comfortable wherever I am. My ""kids"" tell me they miss me, they want me to come back, they want to come with me...but to be there won't feel right. My ""kids"" at State Street tell me they want me to stay, they want to come with me, but I don't feel right there either. Good news is, Jenni is apparently going to start working with us. This make my new void a little less noticeable. Not to sound trite and cliche but I have never allowed myself to get this bad. Usually I can shake it. I don't seem to be able to motivate myself to even do that lately. I refuse to believe medication will be my salvation. I can do it, I do it all the time. This time it just hurts more. I mean, I physically hurt and I don't think anyone can understand that. If I don't hurt then I am numb. I am not comfortable in my own store, house, skin. I realize this is normal and everyone goes through this--so I don't worry. I ride it out like a champ. So I will do that--smiley face everyday until I can get myself out, and enjoy the high when it comes...but until then I guess a healthy dose of self-loathing will tide me over. Fuck you..."

"event","I know it has been a long time since i wrote, so i figure i would update a little. Brandon and I have been doing okay.. We have our times, but he is a total sweetheart. He got me a bouquet of roses yesterday. They are so pretty, they are tiger lillies and yellow roses with pink tips.. :D :D :D :D!! Hehe. I made straight A's this report card which makes me really happy. I made a 99 in Economics.. which the class isn't that hard, but it is impressive to me. Web design is going well and so is my Dual enrollment class... I decided to switch my ""major"" to accounting. Which i think will be fun. I have to work my but off to finish this book so i can get an award. I have decided that I need a job.. Not that my dad or brandon support my funds, but i am tired of that and i want to be able to do things for them. I am going to try and get a job there. Daniel (a guy in my class) said he can get me an interview there. He works there as there accountant and makes a whole lot of monnies. :D I miss band!! I watched them perform the other night and wished i was out there, but i guess i wouldn't be able to go to school if i was. So it's an even trade.  If anyone knows if you can use HTML on this program, let me know. Anyway, I am out. LAter/"

"event","Well I just got home not tooo long ago and I am SOO tired... I stayed the night with Brandon at his cousins house, we went four wheeler riding, It was lots of fun... i had never rode on spring hill before. We got lost but then we found our way. Anyway, I just want to go to sleep, that's all i do really. I think it is because of my new medicine, which is wonderful. I am on that Seasonal stuff which is really great and some noproxin which knocks you out. I was soo tired when we got home last night that Brandon had to take care of me.. he's soo sweet, we are doing great, I am really happy. I hope he is too. Anyway, I am going to sleep. Later.."

"event","I was looking at Colleen's comment and realized that i hate the human race too.. well sorta. I mean people are full of evil intentions. This weekend Tyler came down to see Colleen and I. I went to the game on Friday and only stayed 'til half time.. then i went swimming and stopped at Rusty's to find someone. Then on Sat. Hope, Jessica, Krystal and I went to town and then we drove around and bought some Bacardi Lemo'n and drove around. Then we took Hope home and decided that we should call Seth and see if he was having a party, but he had got into trouble so he wasn't so we asked for Brandon's number... well we called him and decided that we should go to that bog thing.. so we drove all the way out there for thirty mins. It was fun though.. the sad thing is was when i was on my way, A cop had came up behind me with his lights on, so i starting flipping and I pulled over, and he drove past me.... so that was kind of scary.. Anyway, On Sunday I broke up with Lucas (he's an ass) and well m\now i am talking to someone else ;). Anyway, Today is Monday and I am at school.. I get out at 11 and I have to go to Lively. Well i guess i am tired of blabbing, I am sure you are tired of hearing me too... I guess i'll write more later... Latuh. - Josie D."

"event","So wow, This school year has started off great... I have a room/house mate.. she's awesome, she is sooo funny. Her name is Colleen. Anyway, I am at school right now, well the dual part of it, and i should be working, but i am soo sick.. I have a fever, and my throat hurts so why do anything right? I need some loving. Colleen has stayed home two days because she has been sick and now it is my turn. Lets see, I know I haven't wrote in a long time, so let me update you... well ... A lot happened this summer so maybe i should just start from now, and when i am thinking about it, I'll write what i remember. Aubrie got a new job, about time. lol, She needs to be supporting me!!! Just kidding, I am going to go apply for a job today, sick that is... Hopefully i will get it, I know they have been handing the application to people and hiring them there... they need help. And i will be a hostess.. :D. Easy enough i say. I stayed out late last night, past curfew :X. I went to take Collen to see Geiearmo and I went and saw Summer. She is back in town now, which really makes me happy. :D I missed her in a way. I played tennis Monday and really sucked.... Corey was being mean to me so I didn't call him all weekend, and then Sunday he called and checked up on me... that was kind of nice, and then Monday he asked me to come and play tennis... which was also nice. But yesterday he seemed to be in a bad mood again. I know a lot is going on with his life, maybe i shouldn't take it so hard. I wish he knew i was here for him.. I wish i would of told him that I like him... But now i am  back with my X, maybe this will be for the best. I miss hanging out with him, and drinking on the tennis courts :P... hah. Anyway I am going to get back to typing these reports, you don't want me to fail do you???? - Josie D."

"event","I was just sitting here and thinking, life is going to be okay.  :D

 Today, I woke up late. I was suppose to be up at ten to pick up Hope, but considering I haven't really had much sleep the last few days, I kinda over slept, but that's okay. Then I picked up Hope, and we were supposed to go swimming, but we ended up in a brawl on the tennis court in our bathing suits... lol. I was sure the cops were going to get us for indecent exposure. After we got really hot, we went to my house, grabbed some good quality H2o and went for a dip at Lost Creek, kinda scary I know. There were lots of rednecks and that kind of sucked. After swimming I took Hopie home. Then I came home and talked to Airh0n for like the first time in three days. Then five mins. later my mom comes in and she's asks ""Do you want to go with me to Grandma's house?"" I looked at her and said "" I am talking right now, but I will drive over there..."" So I drove over there shortly after that, and her, my grandma, Aunt Judy, and Uncle Dudley were playing a game. So I just sat there, and watched them play, and play, and play. And I thought, wow, this is so great family fun. And if you know me, you'll know that i really don't care for family get- togethers. Also, if you knew my aunt and uncle, they hate children. And if you know me, I'm a child, and that means they don't like me. lol. They have dogs instead of children, that's how bad it is. Anyway, I am playing with a flashlight for some damn amusement, and my Aunt flips out and says "" Please stop playing with that, and save the batteries. You're acting just like a child."" Well my mom says ""Everyone has a child in them""... And I wanted to say was "" Thank you, Lovely Aunt Judy, I am a Child :D."" But i bit my tongue. :D Anyway.... She could do the world some good and adopt kids, but that would be oh too hard... GRR. 
Anyway, enough about my family.  Life's good right now. :D. I haven't talked to Kerri in a couple of days.. :/. OH! I am going to Texas in two weeks. :D with my mother. To see the rest of my family.. I haven't seen them in ten years. I hope I have fun. I am kind of nervous and anxious. These batteries in my headphones just died, the funny thing is i just put them in a hour ago. :/. Lol, i think i will quit typing now... before i go into anymore details about batteries. lol. Thanks for listening once again. :). Bye - Josie D."

"event","Well  today was an okay day, I played some tennis with Kerri and well, did nothing really after that. I have been sick and hopefully I will be back to my old self in no time. I thought maybe i would get to see someone, but considering that I haven't spoken to them but once in the AM, that's not going to happen. I talked to Hope, and she told me a little story, and I was just thinking about how fast things travel in Wakulla, I mean, after all, there is nothing better to do in this town. 
 Crap, I just remembered that I was supposed to call my mother, but considering the time, It is too late now. I might go to Texas this summer, for a couple of days or a week, to see my family. I am excited. I haven't seen them in like Ten years. :-D. I just realized that i am a Senior now. I am on top of the 'food chain'. It feels nice, considering that i have relevantly easy classes. I am a T.A. (teacher assistant) for Guidance, English Honors, Gov't and Economics, Photography at Lively.... and something else I am forgetting, oh well i will get back to you on that. Well actually, I am pretty sure you don't care what I have. Anyway, Sara signed on, I can actually talk to a human now. :D d00t. Anyway, I am going to quit gabbing. Night. - Josie D."

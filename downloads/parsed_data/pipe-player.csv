"event","Where he went wrong was picking up the teddy bear. If he had actually given the matter thought, he would have guessed that they were enchanted. But that's all in the past now, and all he can do is stay in his room and not think of anything erotic. Especially if said eroticism involves Rosencrantz. Reason shall prevail over mindless debauchery.<br /><br /><font size=""1"">Typist: Yeah. Thanks to Cupid's teddy bears, Guil is now horny, if such a thing is possible. Anyone who wants to help/harass him can.</font>"

"event","* An Elizabethan gentlemen of no particular character is pacing about the room* It never fails. As soon as there is any semblance of order in my life, God, fate, or some other capricious higher power shatters it. ( Typist: See Ariel crack thread for more details). *Attempts to calm down, but is immediately up and pacing again* What in God's name am I going to tell Rosencrantz?"

"event","Guildenstern slouches moodily in a chair, tapping his fingers irritably on the edge of the armrest. To a less experienced person, he would look <i>angry</i> at something, discontent with the state of the world. But those who know him better can tell easily that it's just another day for him, just another convoluted thread of logic he tries to hold the world together with.

He fails, usually."

"event","well in light of what is and what is not i must say that i'm stuck. there is no real nice way to find out that the world or at lest everyone else's world does not revolve around you. but in this situation it is really bad. i think that this is just so sad. i really do. i think that if there was going to be a time and space like this there needed to be a conversation that should have taken place so that everyone was in the know. behind all of this ""i'm your friend"" bull there should have been a time where honesty came forth and became the main focus if you will of the group. i do not see where all of this becomes something that everyone just lets go. i see this as being a huge problem which will only grow into something bigger. so when does it end??? when do the secrets come to light??? when and where dose the truth come in because as far as i've been able to see there is no room for it. we say that there is but there really is not. if we were going to tell the truth all of the time most people would not be friends because of what would inevitable have to be said. there are more power in words that people care to say. that whole ""sticks and stone can break my bones but words will never hurt me,"" is worthless. we say it but we don't mean it. even if we fool ourselves and we say that we think we do mean it we don't. if someone says that your ugly the first thing you do is say that your not. but inside your head after you have said that you can not believe this person...you think wow...what was it about me that they didn't like. i could go on forever on this topic and i just might write more later but i've got to go. but i'll leave you with this thought that no matter how long you have been friends with someone they will always have something to say about you."

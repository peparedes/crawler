"event","So I figured it would break me or not. But I feel it is for the best, yeah been burned before by shadiness so can actually say I am okay with it. I just know my work shows for itself. And if that is not the reason, are you feeling a little threaten? I don't have the talents in hair so really no reason to go there, however I have the talents in makeup and doing it the way it should. Clean and knowledgeable. I was surprise with you being a ""professional"" that you were not aware of some pretty well known make up companies..actually shocked. But what do you know, I research. Oh and this so called line, why do I have a feeling it is ladyburd like and yes I am wary of someone using fake products, seriously have you heard what those can do and rum bitch slap was a prime example with her blue pigment. Better know what you are putting on skin before you do. End rant thanks for listening."

"event","I miss LJ. I do. I find myself with fb being my home page...I know everything that is going on, looking at photos...can't play games I am on my iPad. So I go to my old faithful friend, lj. 
Currently I am living in a hotel awaiting the closing of our new home. We have about 2 more weeks or so here. We are living literally onto of each other at times, all of us watching a movie on the bed. My daughter has taken over the ""sitting room"" with her pull out couch. The kitchenette has supplies of microwave or simple meals that I can make on the stovetop. We have been eating out way too much. The Texas sun has me fearing the outdoors along with the rapid cedar trees. We have a pool downstairs, a work out room but we still sit in our hotel room with the dog, like hermits. I have been to the pool a couple of times, but as I said the sun. Something about sun since we have been here, not use to it this time of the year. I also think depresstion took over the family. Stress of the move, our cat getting injured the morning we were flying to the states, then her passing 2 days later. We have cried, but I really believe her death triggered our loss of Scottie and our other cat. 
Buying a house, well that has been an adventure. We are first time home buyers, so let's just say we are learning a lot. We are happy that the owner accepted our offer lower than asking price and we just hot the appraisal yesterday and the house is worth more than we are paying. We are waiting for the owner to move, hence why the closing is taking longer. We are having to pay out of our pocket for the hotel for part of our stay. Hubby's company paid 2 weeks only. 
This move is taking a toll on money. Eating out, boredom shopping, hotel, rental car and so on. As of this week hubby did not get a dime in pay since we lost cost of living allowance for living overseas. Thankfully we have 401k to help out with the expenses, but that money is also allotted for the house buying. 
I am trying to make connections here as far as make up artistry work. I don't have the skills as a hair dresser, so might have some issues in that department. But who knows. I will touch on that topic later. 
I am going to have to find work somehow. Money is going to be tight, sadly buying a house is cheaper than renting. I also owe back child support, from the time I was not employed and disabled. So need to work on that debt. 
Sad thing was I never have gotten money for my unemployment or disability, which would have help my debt. But that is so another story.
Once we get our cars, I think it will be easier...I can seek employment, make doctor appointments and work on going all out. 
I have full faith this is just another test. Oddly I found out my bio mum has skin cancer, the bad kind..she has surgery on the 20th...odd thing..it did not freak me out. I was ok..she has cancer..oh ok. It was like all the stress is just internal. I mean come on we are in a little space and stress has been lashed like hell has no fury between daughter and I. More daughter than myself..angry girl she is. Hormones I keep telling myself. But nonetheless life...it is not so scary, but the waiting sucks.
More later..."

"event","so i am breaking my hubby's rules and on the internet. don't worry it is for my safety. i had a sezuire yesterday. i really bad one. right now i am home from work..which i only had 2 weeks left cause we are moving back to the states soon.. oh yeah. btw we are moving to texas sometime in the next few months. we have already had pre inspections done to the house. 

so cause of the this sezuire i am not allowed to drive for the next 6 months until i am cleared. i really lost about 3 hours of my life yesterday. i sersly don't remember much after i got to the hospital. i was at work when i started not feeling well. the sezuire actually happen at the hospital not at work. so i guess that is a good thing. i love my coworkers since they acted really fast. but i also acted fast myself. tunnel vision and feeling like my blood pressure dropped. i laid on the floor with my feet up. i am such a dork. doing first aid to myself. 

they sezuire they said looked like an epileptic one. i think it is personally connected to whatever stupid unspecified autoimmune disorder i have. i just don't know. but highly annoyed about it. i will admit i have been off one of my meds that was helping out the longstanding med i have been taking for years. cybalta is now what i am taking in combo with my neurotin. sorry spelling sucks for me but i am sure you get the picture. ski is getting my meds today. i just have been to busy at work and don't have the time during lunch or after work to get it. it is one of those meds that you have to be approved for and it is in the fault so takes some time to get. i get off work sometime a little after 6pm- leaving me no time when the place closed at 7pm. and my lunch is an hour...it takes anywhere to 20 minutes just to get to the hospital from where i work. so yeah. time.

my stress levels have been a little high. we are moving. i am leaving work early and we are smack in the middle of summer camp. i feel that i am leaving my comrads stranded. however before the move we have tons of stuff to do. also ski and i were in a car wreck last month ( we were rearended). so my car has yet been fixed and the back is just a total mess. we had to hire attorneys. i also suffered a shoulder injury and severe whiplash. my shoulder is better but every once in a while my neck hurts, but the whiplash annoyed the already damage i have in my neck.  also once we move to the states, my hubby will be playing in the sandbox somewhere in the middle east. that worries me. but life just goes on. 

yeah..."

"event","i got home yesterday from the emergency leave. if you are late on reading my LJ. my former stepmother ( the woman that raised me) died on May 21, 2010. I flew to OKC and then drove with my stepsister and stepbrother back to Cali. we were hoping for her ashes to come with us, however at this time her ashes are somewhere in the mail. we did not have a funeral or memorial service and everything was pretty much left out of sight out of mind. 
her death was sudden, as in the kids did not know how sick she was- according to her death certificate she had been on death's door 3 weeks prior. i had not spoken to her since December time frame due to me finding out that she was speaking to my asshat father butch. i feel guilty for NOT saying goodbye and have been riddled with this guilt. i wanted to take some of her ashes back her to germany- as my way of saying goodbye. but it did not happen- due to we have no clue where the ashes are at this time. 
in my mother's death- we had learned how much of a hoarder she was when it came to little things...pens, razors, candy, etc. as I came home to a dirty house, with my own papers that need to be recycled and a box full of stuff for freecycle. i started to think of the little things that i have around my house i don't use or have no use for. i have decided it is time to PURGE. i am hoping with this PURGE. that i will also purge away some of the feelings i have inside. 
i also have so much other things going on too.
i also found out all the years where i was not working, i have to pay child support- i owe more than 36K in back child support for the years i was not working. i contacted tony and asked him to release me of this debt, considering we have been paying on medical insurance with them and never in the years that i was not working did i not provide for my kids- if they needed something i got it for them or tried my best ability to get it for them.  i can tell you right now, it will take me my lifetime to pay that debt. and currently they are taking my tax returns.  also i have had my daughter since last december and she is still on this order. it is not my fault that i could not find work here in germany. trust me i tried. i was also disabled for many of those years, due to health issues. 
while i was in the states on emergency leave, my asshat father sent my daughter a letter. i have come to realize that this was his way to let me know that my mother was sick. since i did not have contact with her and he knew i would not open a letter from him. the letter was basically a your grandmother is really ill letter and how he supposely stop drinking and smoking these past 5 years. i am sorry but have a hard time believing it.
my baby stepsister while i was out in california, did not want to see me. i guess our mother's death triggered her issues and guilt for not saying anything about the abuse that was going on in the home. i respect her, but my feelings are also hurt. my feelings are hurt, cause i did want to see her. 
i also been having to deal with the issues on the sexual abuse that i went thru due to my brother. having a convo with his wife was not fun. 
my dog scottie is still missing. i know in my heart the worse that he is not coming back
i am also having a hard time dealing. like right now i am just crying. 
i am hoping that if i PURGE some unnessary things here in my home, that maybe i can let go of some inner demons. 
i feel that i should be on a HIGH in my life right now, instead of a LOW. i mean after all my daughter is here, she graduates on the 10th. i am really enjoying my time with her. she also has a wonderful man in her life that purposed on the 21st. (yes, the same day my mother passed). i have known him for 2 years now. they have decided that they just love each other and want to be with each other. so he purposed. they will not be getting married for a few years. he needs to finish up college and well my daughter needs to work on college. they are NOT in hurry despite what i think some people may think. they just love each other. i am so happy for both of them. plus my family that i gain are awesome. i love my ""in-laws"" and have a blast with them. his mom is now one of my best friends. i trust her- which is alot in my line of life. 
my hubby and i now have a home- it is not perfect, we still have some decorating to do. but we have a house. i have room. 
sofiya is taking the role as the only pet left, well. we want to add the addition of a baby kitten, which will be named cherry. i actually need to give a call about that next week.
i have a great job with people who respect me for my work. also my photography is going as well as can be considering i am not in the states and word of mouth. 
i should be on a huge HIGH, BUT i feel so LOW.
i am hoping that doing a house PURGE will help. i want to stop keeping a hold of things that are temporay fixes. as much as i love crafting, art and sewing. do i really need that many things. also- my cds and movies- can be condensed into carrying cases, instead of the plastic cd/dvd cases. i most likely can get rid of my military law books, since i no longer work that field nor do i have the desire. i also have boxes of books, i had set aside already to purge before to freecycle. i already purged some of my clothing in a box- but have some handbags and other unnessary items that i don't use anymore. books and clothing i just freecycle it. i think i might try to sell some of the art/craft/sewing stuff. honestly i really don't know yet. i have a niece that i will send some art supplies to. i have artist friends that i might just let them have first pickings. of course i will save some- since i do like to paint. i have artwork- i just want to purge out. like what is sitting next to me- print copies of 2 digital art pieces. i must have been out of my mind, when trying to sell my art. btw they are up for grabs if you want them. just send me a PM with your info. i also have BOXES full of artwork/unfinished art.  i am purging those. i have BOXES of fabric- going to purge them. most of the vintage fabric that is. i have some quilt fabric i am keeping cause i still want to make some quilts. i have BOXES of craft/beading supplies- what my daughter does not want to keep for her hobby- i will be etsy selling those.  yes, i  will be purging. it may take me a little while, since i work full time during the summer months. but i will get it done. 
i need to let go of things around me-before i can let go the bigger picture inside my brain. 
i guess my mother's death, hit me harder than i thought or the fact the timing just stinks. who knows. 
i go off camping at rock am ring for the next few days....i plan on enjoying the music and the friendships of my family during this time. i want to change."

"event","so my son turns 16 on monday. i have been reflecting the past couple days about that. when it comes down to it, will be 15.5 years since he has lived with me. all this time he has lived with his dad. i feel jaded at times, but i know i did the best decision at the time. 
i was a lost soul. i needed to take care of myself, i had to learn to take care of myself before i could take care of anything else. 
i still feel lost at times. my heart aches cause i know i missed so much with my kids. with nauci living with i am not so much in a full blown parent, since well she is an adult now. i manage the whole let's get you graduated from school, but she is her own personality now. we are friends and mother and daughter. i love that part about us. but with my son, it is different. i feel more far away from him. 
i feel huge miles more than i have in years. i don't know if it because he is growing older or myself growing older. or the part that one kid lives here and the other lives in the states.
i really want to go back to the states, more so than i have had in years. i want the change and at this point in time i don't even care if it is back to texas and me having death by cedar. 
i rather be in hawaii. but as we found out the paperwork was never even turned in. the guy now who works the job is very green. i guess it was not meant to be at this time. maybe there is a reason for delays. i always believe that there is a time for everything. i am not a bible thumper but a very spirtual person and that passage 
1&#160;To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
2&#160;A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
3&#160;A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
4&#160;A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
5&#160;A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
6&#160;A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
7&#160;A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
8&#160;A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
what time is it now? a question i often ask myself. time comes and goes. 

i have had my time with verse 2...i was born, i almost died, i was reborn imho...i have planted myself in many places and i have uprooted myself many places
in verse 3 i killed the old me inside and i healed. i have had my time in the ""spa"" broken down, emotional and physical. i had to rebuild myself and i still do to this day. 
verse 4 i have laughed, i have weeped, i have mourned and i have danced....i rather laugh and dance then mourn and weep.
verse 5 i have cast away stones that were thrown at me, i have casted a few stones in my life. i have embraced life fully and surely have refrained.
verse 6 i have lost and i am still awaiting my time to get and keep. 
verse 7 i kept silence to long in my life to the point that well, let's just say it ruined part of my life. i know i can speak. and speak my mind i do. maybe sometimes a little to loud.
verse 8 that verse get's me every time. a time to love, a time to hate, a time of war and a time of peace....we as humans have a hard time following that last verse...

comtemplative yes...after all isn't that was time is about?"

"event","so laugh with me...i sliced the hell out of my left foot without noticing about 15/20 minutes ago giving myself a min pedi..MAXI pads make great bandages! 
we are in tech week for CATS...my life will be consumed here shortly! oh wait it already is! 
i start on my paperwork for my normal paying job this week. fingerprints on tues, security paperwork on thurs. 
had dinner with nauci's BF parents. his dad is in from downrange. nice guy..i love..love love his mom! she and i get along well. we have agreed to go out and do a dress up girlie thing after cats and she returns from holiday. i also adore his grandmother. she was so talented as an artist.....wish she still could paint. 
hell i wish i could do some painting or at least some photography...
speaking of nauci signed up for model mayhem..looks promising she already had a few photographers ask her about some work. of course i am cross examining all the photographers and giving her insight since i work with models as a photographer myself. i also need to do a proper model shoot with her in the spring.
which the past couple days here it is starting to feel like spring it is so wonderful.
i also will be doing some photography work for a few people. i was asked for some senior photos- one will be shot in june before they move back to the states. i think august i will do the other. also one of the theater gals asked me to help her beefing her port again and make some business cards. 
also there are a couple of models on mayhem that want to work with me and i want to work with them. i am hoping to schedule a shoot. which since photography schedule will be getting busy i think after jake's women..i don't think i will have time for little shop at the theater. with working a normal job, my time schedule is really tight with photography
i am happy with much glee about hawaii being safe. you could swear that ski and i both lived there with the internet/social media coverage that was going on in the house. plus i called kelley to make sure she was safe and okay. she was just pissed about being out of wine! that is why i love my kelley! actually they were in a safe zone.
oh health wise..i am getting better. still have to use my inhalers. still coughing. everyone around me is calling that virus i had the death virus cause yes, it was just that bad. can't believe it has been over a week when i first started to feel ""bad""
Oh OH oh...there are these guys helping out on the wigs now...OMG!! brillant!! i love love love love them!! i was starting on the wigs doing the ear things..but they started doing all the painting and more shaping OMG <3 <3 sersly can not express it. like a school girl right now!! 
overall things are good. drained...busy...but good!"

"event","okay stupid moment in MUA. so i ordered a palette that contains all the bright colors the girl cats need- plus a few things to make my life easier on airbrush side of the house. ordered from costal scents- cause hey cheap palettes and don't care if they get broken over my MAC/other products that cost an arm and leg. yeah..thought i ordered it. had to order yesterday- the shipped it last night. so in the meantime. snagged some of personal pressed and thru them in ELF empty palettes. and i am missing setting spray..maybe i did take it to the theater? have not used my FAT MAX case cause it is to big for this show when i open it ( i have a little area my the front door for myself) nauci did bring me home a table that her drama teacher threw out, which is perfect. now just need big containers to keep me organized.
so wondering now where the hell my head was when i placed everything in my cart. but i think that was also the time, when i looked at the bank account a screamed since we paid electricity on the old apartment- when we don't live in it. that was like an extra $500 that was so NOT in the budget. and i tell you...still think something is fishing with our $700 natual gas bill. ( $$ amounts are reflextive of what we are paying after converting the &#8364; amount)
i did manage to muster the energy to go to the theater around 1pmish and work on wigs. i got to work with this wonderful modeling material that you just heat up and create shapes ( can't remember the name of material right now). i have to make a bunch a cones and then spray adhesive them and the hair into shape on wigs. 
here is a cell phone shot of couple i worked on yesterday.

so my dear LJers...my goal is to at least write in this thing once a week and also work on my photography blog too
CATS is going well- it is becoming magical with the cats I mean cast members. Wigs are in, hopefully Dane gets wig heads this week so I can start on them. Face charts are done and cast is already starting to learn thier makeup. 
This show has been a huge learning experience for me...it opens March 5th and sersly can't wait! 
Next show I will work on will be Jake's Women ( however only do hair and makeup)
Oh for those who don't know---in CATS I have been working all over the place. I am the Makeup Director and the Asst. Director but also have been helping Costume department on making cat tails- oh the yarn that has crossed paths in my house..Today I am working on my  7th tail...I love the fact that we are such a team this production and well every other production too- but this production is really MAGICAL..oh and I actually get some stage time too-- as a fake Macavity- but who cares I can say I was in CATS--LOL
I wish you all can come see it! 
Well, my house is a mess- but I don't care...letting things roll off my back
Got to pick up the kid ( oh yeah,  btw way folks Nauci moved out to Germany in Dec) I should post her B-day photos...here can't believe she turned 18."

but now with vlogging on YT..twitter...facebook and running a photography blog + now being the asst. director and makeup director for CATS i am running a blogroll there too. most of the time if i have time to waste i am sick and place fishville or cafe world, right now. but in the near future with my daughter moving in with me- i dont see my life being on the net to much, unless it is during the daytime and i have NOTHING to do.

my life is just going forward. i am growing.

"event","so i have failed at posting photo of the day for what 2 weeks. i have been crazy arse editing actual shoots this week. sorting thru over 2000 photos. as you see from my twitter addiction, i have 3 folders left on wedding 2, if all goes well i will be done by this time next week. 

however if you are curious on recent wedding 1 you can see them in my current failboat of zenphoto which seems to change cause it is undergoing updates on their servers. hopefully this annoyance will go away soon, ps...not the entire wedding is for view to the public, just a few shots

in other crazy news, dealing with my makeup side. i am currently gaga on <a href=""http://www.occmakeup.com/liptar.html"">occ lip tars</a>, staying power and need just a little. can't wait to use them on clients. oh wait this weekend i can. i have a steampunk designer shoot on sat. i have ideas. hopefully weather and sun works with me. 

if i could afford, i would buy strobes. i can't not going to happen until we get to hawaii and i have more income on my end. i am however buyng a new flash (cross fingers tomorrow) i hate my manual one. thought i could deal with it, but can't.

so yeah, enjoy the twitter addiction in the meantime.

"event","so for the past month since i started vlogging again  i have had issues, well add issues with running win 7 64bit on m old vaio. today was the last straw of software not running right, my graphic card speaking no love. so downgraded my OS back to vista.
i am getting an iMac sometime in the next month or so, after my buying my flight to the US. so in the meantime sonygirlie aka they vaio just needs to do. honubaby aka the acer aspire is strictly travel, location shoots- has lightroom and some video stuff since well it is my on the go computer. 
also i bought a orange, which seems to be my new fav color. sony vertical webbie HD cam. vlogging on the go. perfect for travel. the camera is only 5MP, but okay with me. i know i know my PAS nikon is way better, but i love the flip 270 degree. plus it is one touch. movie or camera. easy use for on the go. 
i also had to buy a new tripod today. i have a huge one that christina gave me that is on wheels, but it is for uber big cameras. my little tripod broke, it wont tighten any more so i bought a new tripod slight larger with 360 degree ball.  it is not the uber high tech ones, but it will do. the level in it is about the size of an altoid. 
i hate the part of reinstalling EVERYTHING, which is what i am doing now. but taking it a little slow. i do however have to get the MAIN THINGS on sonygirlie again, like photo editing stuffs. 
working..being geekette..and vlogging more.
bye for now"

Thanks to seeing Monica at an art space in central philly when i had to screen print some shit, she reminded me of this awesome place, and how much i miss reading everyone's diaries. i wish it was called livediary. ANYWAY, GUESS HERE IS MY FIRST ENTRY IN A WHILE

DEAR LIVEJOURNAL,

Life sucks balls as usual. work blowz, school sucks, and i have no time for anything, but weed rules so does beer (as usual) and friends do too even though i dont ever get to see them. uhhh gotta go do a GENERATIVE ART PROJECT, which by the way should be super fuckin coool i guess, maybe not.

"event","does anyone on this thing openly take mood altering prescribed drugs for certain personality flaws, because im wondering what do you call it when you are perpetually angry and believe the world is out to lie to you and get you, and you believe you are the ONLY one who doesn't suck, i mean thats fucking retarted, i know i am not the only one who doesn't suck, but i can't help but feel that way, that my actions are the only just ones, and i NEVER lie which i really dont most of the time occasionally to my parents or some douche bag dude that wants to bone me.  im thinking these thoughts are escalated by taking birth control but it has been really bad for about more than a year, since i started taking those birth control. i am under a lot of stress, and find no relief in anything around me...i barely listen to music anymore, which is ALL that i used to do, even if i draw, i'll be calm for the time being, but i'll continue along my vein popping psychosis for the remainder of the night...there is something wrong with me, i think i've gone off the deep end, when you slam doors and throw shit because you spilt coffee and missed your train, it's not coool...it's fucking stupid, and if old manda saw herself, she would say ""wow what a strung out douche bag""...new manda says ""i can act this way because i am obviously a fucking child piece of crap..."" who knows...fuck therapy though, and fuck all that shit, i just need to know what other people think...just asking if anyone knows anything...im sure one of you have been to therapy."

"event","YEAH so last night i had a dream that i was stuck in this house/shack with james brown??? and he had bandages on his wrists, i decided to help him out because he was complaining about how uncomfortable he was....so i unwrapped them, and there were huge peices of glass stuck in his wrists, i started removing them, and actually saying to myself in the dream, ""i gotta wash these off so i can fucking sell these shits on ebay!""...another weird thing was that they had smelt really bad, first time i can recall knowing how to smell in my dreams....or creating a smell...it smelt like the crust in people's stretched ears...i dont know what the FUCK that dream means, but jenny told me that james brown was kept inside his parents house for like three weeks because they couldn't decide where to bury him. i think i had that dream cuz i saw this sticker on goldieboxx's helmet that was james brown...and i looked at it and thought it was cool, and i need money, so in my mind, i made that up.. i have a lot of celebrity ridden dreams, is that strange? i would say yes. i dont know...all i know is my dreams are REAL fucked up. and when i take naps in the middle of the day i ALWAYS have sex dreams. frued didn't know shit cuz he was all coked up, so we still dont know what dreams mean, we just know we see shit in the day, and our brain runs down the list of memories, and dreams are the result of that."

"event","HEY, I haven't written in here, mainly because it would be a bunch of bitching and whinning that I would not want to look back on. THANK GOD I kept all that shit to a close select few of my friends. but now I'm going to write about it anyway, just to see what everyone opinion was on my earlier state (i.e. over the summer). 

I'll start with the TOTALLY AWESOME parts that happened to me. I got a B in chemical principals for the first part of the summer course, it sucked, it was from May 31st to like June 28th. I believe these to be the correct dates, whatever it was long and sucky, it was four days a week FOUR HOURS A DAY. plus I worked at the liquor barn, thrusday friday and saturday...AWESOME. Liquor Barn was good to me. I made some money...SOME money, none of which accumulated, it was a good SIXTY bucks a week, if I didn't train anywhere, or spend money on cigarettes or alcohol, I would of saved some cash, but that amount is not worth saving. 

I made the travel team for roller derby. that's cool. we are going to vegas november 16th. AWESOME. we just played the new york team, they are tough as hell, and awesome to play, i'm glad we sort of hanged in there with them. The audience was large in amount, and was vocal even though they were in a forty point lead, and it was pretty much decided who was going to win, they still kept up the cheering...which i was happy about.

I saw the gorilla buscuits, it was fucking AMAZING. and i saw the Melvins last tuesday, again AMAZING as hell...two drummers, and a gong, which i didn't get to see hit, they must of done it in the beginning. They abruptly ended, they turned on the lights, and didn't do a gay ass encore...which makes them super fuckin cool.

Now for the bad part of my summer, Anthony broke up with me in June, my car broke down in July, and well, my work fired me in August, or ""laid off"". whatever. I felt like a loser in all instances, one i didn't have money to fix my car (see above), i couldn't go anywhere to meet fly dudes because i had no car, and fly dudes didn't exist to me because i was too busy still being in love. when did i start using the word fly as a descriptive term for males, i dont know... anyway... he kept telling me he wanted me back, i think it was because i didn't leave him alone...but he would call me too when i didn't call him...we went back out twice then he broke up with me again and again....apparently when i was busy trying to understand the nature of wasting an entire year with a person, and nuturing a relation with them, to have strong trust and commitment, he was out fucking some dumb twat that waited on us at the one nice resteraunt he took me to when we went out. awesome. he also made out with some indian at work, stayed at her house and was drunk every day we were broken up. COOL. then when he decided he really wanted me back, and asked me back out, i said he would have to wait, then one sunday when i was away at baltimore at a game subing for the baltimore girls, i called him he said he missed me, then that night he took home some junky stripper and made out with her, said that he didn't do anything more than ten minutes of making out and went to sleep and she slept on the couch, i believe him because she left a nice comment on his dumb ass myspace ""tonight is the night, i have never had to beg for it, i'm going to rape you if i have to..."" blahddy blah blah blah. i felt like shit....as you can imagine...i trusted him, he apologized. then a couple weeks later i found out about the dumb twat waitress above....from his friend. COOL. we worked it out...he is really trying and he says that he loves me, and he was confused, because he never wanted a life where he wanted to stay with one person. my question to him is ""why did you ask me out then"" if you dont want commitment, and you dont want a realtionship that could possibly grow into a strong commitment, and complete love, then why would you want a girlfriend, why would you tell them that you loved them??? well...i dont know...i guess another notch in the belt? i think he was just confused and doesn't want that for himself, and he wants to tell himself he doesn't want that, while going about all the wrong actions to ensue security in never having commitment, i.e. asking someone out and telling them you love them....now he talks of moving in together, and me being the only girl he loved, i assumed that i was the only girl he liked when he asked me to be his GIRLFRIEND. but that was wrong... i'm scared i'm in for it, so i keep asking questions about when we were ""broken up"" or ""fucking and not fucking fucking and not fucking"". i was real fucked up for three months straight, more so than i ever have been before. apparently he didn't want to have someone that he ""fights"" with, or someone that he had to ""answer"" to. we barely fought, and i didn't ask him to answer to me about anything...but i'm hoping he was just confused, but now i am. i am confused about a lot of things...i know if i stay with him, he'll want to stay in hamilton trenton area for the rest of his life because thats where all his friends and admirers are. i'm about going to live somewhere where i can grown and live life. i dont know what i want to do. im very confused. i love him, and i will try and work it out, because i know from experience with family and friends that in order to love someone you must be understanding, even when they hurt and abonden you beyond belief. and it's going good now, better than it ever has...and i believe him when he says he loves me. i just wish i was busy riding other dudes dicks instead of staying inside reading and drawing like a fuckin dork loser peice of shit. i should act like a 21 year old party girl going out finding some dumb asshole to insert his penis into my vag, like almost every other person i know...but i can't...it sucks, i can find a hundred better things to do than have sex with someone i dont know and dont love...its not fun to have sex with someone you dont love...not to me anyway...i wish i felt that way life would be easier. instead i find it relieving that someone who isn't my family could love me unconditionally, like a friendship but more....because someone you have sex with is a possible creation of a family, whether us humans would like to think so, with the advent of the condom and everything...sex is mainly for approcriation...pleasure is just so we'll do it..., i take it very seriously that this penis better be owned by someone who is completely facinating and enthralling and caring and loving enough that the possibility of there being half of me and him in another being better be a good one that is supported by the security of a family....i dont want a family and i dont want kids, but the point is that is why i have feelings about sex and other people. that and i've had an std, so fucking around with people isn't cool, its disgusting, and especially because its an std you can recieve WITH a condom and 80 percent of females have it, if anything i believe that to be a wake up call to women and their choice in men, however...women continue to say yes, right off the bat, and i believe that to be poor character and i dont care what you free spirited fucks have to say about it. so i spent my summer acting like a thrity year old with intrests and solid feelings and emotions...thats DUMB. i wish i never met him sometimes...then i wouldn't be in this perdicament. but realtionships ones in which are romantic are dumb, and i wish i still didn't care...i never used to...i used to be able to be o.k. with it....break up with dudes, and be o.k. with it. i guess i found something i actually wanted more of...eh i dunno, this was the crappiest written entry ever. i can't write right now....i suck, i can't put my feelings into words. well...im gonna go study physics....AHHH."

"event","IT IS! I'm bringing it back into my practice of obtaining music for collection. It's AWESOME it's like a present that you give to yourself. I'm putting TEN dollars every couple weeks in my bank account for funding of my reignited flame of passion for the yellow, bubble wrapped package of excitement. This of course is instead of giving my money towards the non-menthalated goodness of nicotene which is raising in price, and the degenerative race of camdinites who roam the street looking for fair faced maidens as myself to pray upon for dollars. FUCK THEM, today was the last day I WILL ever be nice to a fuckin homeless fucker. I DO-NOT care you peice of shit....  this of course is an intro to the experience i want to share with my livejournal community of friends... I was waiting outside of the building that houses my upstairs classroom that teaches Western Civilization, drinkin some coffee, that was a DOLLAR, and talking to my mother on my defunct cell phone that my dad had given to me from his mound of USED cell phones from his drivers....some latino (to appease all you pc mother effers) was in possesion of it beforehand so it had Laquanda and Rosia in the phone book, and i love lucy as the ring tone. i wondered if i should call one of the two and tell Rosia that Laquanda was in the phone book, or the other way around, but i decided to just delete them, and put the B52's as my ringtone, who knew spics like the B52's!!! just kiddin gusy...but anyway prior to being completely sidetracked by explaining the state of dispair my phone has rendered me to, i was talking about me holding my cell phone talkin to my mom, and holding a coffee, typical college stance, although i wasn't wearing the college shirt and i dont have highlights or big sunglasses to hide my ugly ass face, not that they aren't cool but man college sluts LOOOVE lookin like they jumped out of the pages of fuckin VOGE or i dont even know how to spell that shit, on with the fuckin story! so some dude, who was kinda cute was walkin down the road (you will realize why i had such an attraction to the man when i explain myself further) i was like eh, he's cute, you know one of those things you think, then he approaches the trashcan, i was thinking OF COURSE....HES FUCKIN HOMELESS OR ON DRUGS, (i know how to pick em!) yeah so then he sees me, after he illusively looks in the trash trying the whole pathetic bit, he looks at me and says ""can you help me out"". i responded with, which i usually always throw them a dollar, cuz thats half the way there of a forty, until the new law comes into effect, then he's gotta work a little harder, but this time i only had THREE dollars, because the night before i had to give lauren mari TEN dollars of the TWENTY my parents give me every four days (mexican wages if you ask me, i clean te whole mother effin house for this shit and make them food sometimes, dicks) but i needed ONE dollar and twenty five cents to get onto the train, i had spend the other dollar on one dollar twenty five cents coffee so i could stay awake in class....well to make an initially short story a bit short of being extremely too long, he replied with ""I DONT WANT TO HEAR IT""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and then he said ""im FUCKING DYING"" couldn't be the fuckin CRACK you were smokin, or nothin, NOOO couldn't be, or whatever the fuck you are doing, but you look pretty clean to me, and he wasn't like SKINNY as shit, and his eye wasn't falling out of his head, and plus he didn't tell a joke, but no really...WTF? WTF? what a fucking ASSHOLE! i just started laughing, but i really thought about it and i should of said FUCK YOU dicksmackin SHIT TURD. what a fuckin peice of shit. now becuase of him i wage war on EVERY HOMELESS PERSON ALIVE, i dont care! i dont care if they are missing an eye. I DONT FUCKING GIVE A SHIT. thats it, im damning an entire forgotten downtrodden peoples to a life of RETORIC from me because of one man, yes, i am. and im going to start with any mother fuckin fucker that asks me for a fucking dollar, FUCK YOU, no, i dont care what you need it for, there is food in the trash, i've eaten trash, it's not that fuckin bad, suck it up pussy. and i know many of my friends WILLINGLY eat trash. im going to go listen to MOD at ONE THIRTY IN THE MORNING so i can refresh my hatred and then go to school with a new found drive for life, THE COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF THE HOMELESS, NOT THROUGH CARE BUT THROUGH HATE!!!!!!!!!!! yes. fuck them.

this is Drake. Drake, loooves jesus, he messaged me on myspace with this:
Hey, What is that a picture of on your profile? 
<br>
Which i knew what he was getting at so i wrote this...because he obviously trying to get me to love jesus, look at his profile:
<br>
thats me in a bar partially destroying my body with fermentated hops and rolled up and processed tabacoo leaves. or in lamen's terms me and my friends at a bar on my twenty first birthday enjoying the blood of christ to the full extreme, because i am officially allowed to. i like your name, sounds cool. my name is amanda, and i am a soldier of satan. no use trying to talk me out of it, i've been one since the day i was born, marked and picked by the almighty himself. sorry, i know that you believe that though jesus, you will save people. however, i do not need to humor, serve, nor gain reward from a GOD, whose existence is within myself. we are god my son, and it is a beautiful world, there is no good nor bad, just positive and negative, now if we believe in the positive, love will emerge, and we will all sing happy songs, but until then i will use my muse of the hilarity which telling people i am a soldier of satan because it's pretty funny. i am a very good friend, and a very good sister and daughter and girlfriend. listen dude, we are on the same page here, we just want people to be happy, but what im telling you is we should start a whole organization, get people to believe in themselves and each other, without religion, therefore we are following the footsteps of jesus, becuase you know what i bet you he didn't give a damn if that blind person was a jew, a fuckin peagan, whatever, he just wanted to spread love and hope. thats what i am about, and what i always will be about. so don't try to sell me some jesus bullshit, i understand maybe thats how your family and life has been rewarded through following some story, which it is a wonderful book, dont get me wrong, some real cliffhangers there, but PLEASE this is why the world cannot be saved through missonary work and or anything else, because it's completely closed minded, and rediculous to believe that just through becoming a christian you can become a better person, no. it's through what you DO, not because you attend church. but i guess really without you people existing, my joke wouldn't be funny, so keep believing, and then die and rot into the ground, not even realizing before you die the beauty of the rot, so HAIL SATAN MY MAN! HAIL THE ALMIGHTY GOD OF HUMANITY AND THE CREATOR OF ORGANIZED RELIGION TO KEEP THE POSITIVE CONTAINED WITHIN THE BRICK WALLS AND UNDER THE MEANS OF A RETARTED BOOK! 

LOVE amanda. 
<br>
then he replied with this:
Manda, How are you not going to beleive in God, but you beleive in the ""Author of Confusion"" which is Satan? 
Thats great that you know Satan is real. But I don't think you know that Satan is a Liar. God's word tells me Satan comes to kill, still, and destroy. Hes like a roaring lion, roaming the earth seeking whom he may devour. Listen, do you honestly think Satan loves you?.....Cause I know for a FACT Satan hates me. He wants to throw all of lifes glits and glamour at me to make me feel loved. He wants to feel my voids with empty, vain thrills that leave me hanging dry at the end. I learned loooooong ago that only JESUS CHRIST can fill all of my voids, all of my longings, and all of my needs...... he even mended my broken heart. He gave his life for us and I won't be quiet about that! He has pulled the wool from over my eyes and reveiled the hatred that satan craftfully hides from people denying God's gift of eternal life. Don't get tricked, Satan is not a MAN. He is a fallen angel thats been walking the face of the earth for thousands of years, learning the very nature of man. He knows the way humans walk, talk, think, and the things that pleases our five senses. So don't try to figure Lucifer out! Only through God is he defeated! 

Manda God loves you. He wants to be your everything. Accept him in your heart today. 
<br>
now whose is more logical and why he couldn't just accept my way of thinking right off the bat is acceptable, but atleast make sense, WOOL? what the fuck you had a blanket around your face? a wool blanket?? not even a good metaphor, he probably picked that up from his retarted preist, or minister whatever in the fuck they have in churchs now. i just said i want to spread love and hope and im attempt to be a good person (what i believe to be a good person) and just because i dont believe in jesus, automatically im ignorant to some lion beast that roams the world. people want to be good, but only when they are rewarded by someone higher up, it's like a fucking job, a blow job if you ask me. asking the boss man and only being nicer to  your employees because you get rewarded by someone higher. thats what you get for having a demented peice of shit king write the bible. whatever, people are never going to know or learn, but hey, it's my job thats what GOD sent me here to do, tell them what fucked up peices of retarted shit they are, so they can possibly make everything happier and more joyous instead of pleasing and inward. the selfish bullshit people do realy ticks me off, and to think they believe they are somehow nicer, better, more close to god just because they are under some objection. well we've thought this for years and it hasn't done a damn thing except for people who are fresh out of rehab, or divorce and need a way out. GOD DAMNIT."

"event","ok so i was thinking of a couple things yesterday, things i could possible write papers on. one inparticular i think is completely do-able with research. i was thinking about ed gein (spelling) because i was peeling away fat and meat from fried chicken for an art project with the bones, i was thinking, i enjoy doing things like this, its really fucked up and creepy but i like to get down to the core of things and fix problems and be specific, this is probably why i love science. now if my parents weren't addicted to drugs when i was younger (and yes i am blamming them) i would of went to a better school, because my father would of been a lawyer, and my mother a botonist, but instead they became a warehouse worker and a bartender and a sexy resteraunt. i was wondering if things would of been differnt i would of been a great surgeon, because i was really smart when i was little, and i enjoyed reading my dad's college books, i knew about cilia when i was like seven years old, i didn't understand half of the words i was reading but i enjoyed looking at the pictures and trying to take notes. i was thinking that i could write about how a serial killer, someone who craves immense power, if they would of been great surgeons, now follow me here. let's take DR> JOE SHMO M.D. he went to boarding school when he was younger, and his parents supported him, he attended, lets say a utalitarian church and he understood the importance of life and all the things that came with it, and why he was studying so hard to help humans want to succeed and live longer, and why health was important and in his hands to deal with. now ed gein, he had the same mind (a mind that is mathematical, enjoys solving problems, searching for how things work, and a craving for some sort of leadership or we can use the more demonic term when associated with killers power hungry) he liked to go and make shit about of human bodies fromt he graves, his mother mislead him into believing all these fucked thoughts of god and humanity and good and evil. he was constructed by his creator to believe these things. ...i'll finish later."

"event","ok so here's the low down, so far no cancer, i gotta go for an MRI, which is superly duperly cool and shit. because it doesn't involved getting fingered extensively. i wonder what these doctor's wives do, like do they ""play doctor"" and shit. thats hot. im sure they do. 
<br>
on another note, i dropped physics, i missed to much of it, and i missed an exam because of that bullshit above, so i said fuuuck it...and i dropped it, so im taking it over the summer. which should be awesome because well...its with this one professor that is easy, and nice. i will be done school next year. i cant wait, i'll feel accomplished and i can get out and start doing adult bullshit, like get my own pad and fuckin smoke weed on my own salary and fuckin draw all day because i wont have homework, i'm just gonna have regular work. awesome awesome
<br>
so im twenty one, its cool being carded and shit, i got a little drunk yesterday on accident at twelve in the afternoon...i drank a budweiser and a cup of wine, didn't know that could make me drunk. im beginning to really like my school friends, they are awesome as hell.
<br>
almost winter break! oh yaaaah. im writting a story, or a script for john mcmonagle, i explained it to him at wesley's and he liked it. its fuckin creepy, and really doesn't make any sense. i will post it up here when i get it written. i also came up with an idea with buffalo chicken wings, i've got a project. so i've got two projects that i have prepared myself for over break. 
<br>
i got three cd's with my birthday money man is it nice hearing a whole fuckin albulm instead of just like a couple and shit, i got Church of Misery- MASTER OF BRUTALITY (which is my favorite cd i own right now, it is fucking awesome), i got Adrenalin O.D. -HUMANGUSFUNGASAMONGUS which is cool, jersey natives. i got The Melvins - gluey proch treatments....trying to get a collection goin and shit, it's fuckin good. but yes, i would suggest everyone fuckin toke a huge joint to Church of Misery, or just like blast it loud as fuck in your room and pretend you are in the seventies and rockin the fuck out like a rocker should. its fucking awesome. oh man i can't imagine what they are like live. 
<br>
I saw that johnny cash movie, pretty cool, i guess, whatever same ol biography, fifty million chicks, cheating, and drugs. blahddy blah blah, shut up. yeah it was cute how he wanted to marry her and shit, but whatever, it isn't THAT interesting to make him some sort of icon and or make an entire movie blockbuster about it. someone needs to make a movie about cool people once in a while, im bored of everything. i want some weird ground breaking shit to come out. yeah he's hot and she's hot, we're all hot hey!! seems like the only way anyone wants to see a movie anymore is if makes you wanna masterbate, or it makes you think that love exists in some sort of cinderella fashion. gay. gay. gay. but johnny cash's songs do fucking rule and how he sung about the ""poor and beaten down"" he's fucking awesome for that and for that he should be an icon, not because he overcame some drug addiction and loved some whore (she was an awesome musician too). but yeah, i liked how they had a lot of reinacted live scenes that was pretty cool.
<br>
oh next year next year is gonna be awesome. im gonna try and get lauren reichert to become the next richard prior, except white and female. it's gonna work. im tellin ya. 
<br>
and another goal of mine to begin and finish before winter break is to make a zine dedicated to what exactly i hate about the philly scene, and what i love about it. and photocopy old pictures of jake, and write and enitre essay about how fucking retarted squatter kids. i love how he used to actually hate gay people, like he really fucking hated them, and he really didn't like jewish people, and he wasn't even joking. i thought he was for a while, and i would get into fights with him about it, and now he's the one all P.C. and shit, it's funny how much all the lyrics that they listen to, which they probably dont even know what the fuck they are saying, are all about being true or yourself and fucking what the MAN has to say. i know real squatter's jake, thats zara's parents, they go into a community, take an abondoned building buy it for a hundred dollars and fix that shit up. that is the real definition of a squatter, not fucking living with some hopeless retarted old alcoholic bitch and a bunch of crackhead friends and getting a fuckin stray dog that you probably can't feed and it was better on its own. man i fucking hate squatters more than ever. they took my friend, who i guess really wasn't my friend, and they lured my exboyfriend into becoming complete retardo alcoholic loser fucks who do nothing but beg and scavange for what they need. they want all this free shit all the time, they want to live for free, and live in a community, they want change from some random person, but what the fuck do they give the rest of the world for free? besides spreading nasty disease and fucking taking and starving hte wondering dogs of the world. they constantly bitch and complain about progression, yet they won't think twice about plugging in their guitar, and or hoping on the back of a freight train that is ONLY THERE BECAUSE IT IS TRANSPORTING GOODS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE STRUCTURED ECONOMY AND IT ONLY EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE CAPITALIST DRIVE FOR COMPETITION. they are nothing but sorry excuses for passion and wasted wasted lives. zara's parents bought a whole fucking abondoned town in lobo texas, with a bunch of their other friends, go ahead GOOGLE that shit, LOBO TEXAS. the reason they started that is because they want a town where they can do whatever the fuck they want when they want. and they are all college graduates, and working folk, some of them don't work, but they don't fucking drink every god damn night and spend time rubbing dirt all over themselves. fuck it. i want to kill that mother fucker one for being so fake, and two for calling me a prissy bitch, prissy bitch, he used to call me a dyke, and now because half the chicks he probably hangs out with are dykes because they believe in ""free love"" and ""no boundries on anything, even sex"" blah blah blah, a bunch of hippie rhetoric bullshit. it's all hipocritical to the EXTREME, and it's funny how there is a whole band of these people all across the united states. well i'd like to say it, Punk was always dead, and it always will be. it's like the hippie idea of not giving a fuck somehow found it's way towards a bratty little kid that you just want to hit and then they decided it was really super cool to never fuckin shower, which is just confusing. that bitch that he is living with needs to take care of her kids, she's forty now, and just because she's a complete alcoholic, and makes herself feel better by fuckin making these younger dudes and chicks live with her that have the same problem, because all of her older friends either died, moved away, or got help. i think she needs to do the same. but misery loves company. and im glad that he's not my friend anymore because of how fake he is, just kills me that he could say ANYTHING to me, when he's the fakest mother fucker around. im glad i got away from deane because that was just a lost fucking cause, i knew thats what he wanted, and i wasn't about to join in. everyone can suck it. it's funny i always thought jesse was way too angry about all of it."

I GOT TO NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY IN THE FIRST BOUT, which was ok, i was swigin jack behind the thing cuz goldie box had some i was kinda drunk which was awesome and made me want to talk on camera REAL bad to the LIVE fox news, oh yeah, i wanted to just say fuck or pussy every other word, make my parents real proud. seems like anything that girls do collectively it is related to sex and shit. but thats a totally different topic for a different time. roller derby is fuckin awesome, its so much fuckin fun. and it gives this god forsaken tristate shithole something to do on the weekends besides visit a bar, and or their drug dealer, although im sure that makes the derby experience much better if you tailgate and shit, or just take some acid....or speed. do it. well, i had an awesome time, everyone of my friends or jenny's friends, should come to the next bout, and hold up signs, YES, you should. 
<br>
i can't get rid of my cough and its pissing me off, cuz my body is trying to deal with two shitty things at once....a fuckin internal bleeding bullshit, and fuckin a sickness. well, hopefully nothing bad is goin on down with my right egg sac of bullshit. because i haven't gotten a call from either doctor, and if something is wrong, WHAT THE FUCK IS TAKING THEM SO FUCKIN LONG. retardos."

""welcome to the east coast thats where we drink the most""...yes yes it probably is. oohhh freedom, no one has a clue. i used to sit on haystacks when i was a kid and just stare straight out, and think for hours and hours, until my dog came up and bothered me and or my sister. here, there isn't anywhere to do that at, im either in someone's backyard, or someone is looking at me strange, i can't be left alone, there is no where to go to be alone here...except this little place down by the river, but then im staring at the dump, and im in someone's backyard, it is a nice spot. im not sad, i just hate feeling this close to people, i dont want to have shitty empty conversations, i like most people...ok well i dont, but i would LIKE to like most people. and sometimes it is nice to hear silence, have you ever thought of what all this noise does to your psyche...shit constant car, airplane, television, music, talking, there is always a sound around here, and it's not those nice locusts i would hear in nebraska they would be loud all at once and then QUIET suddenly, there would always be that jackass locust that would sit there. that was my entertainment, and its more enthralling than when the next social event coming up is, and or when the next trip to the mall would be. i haven't felt this way in a long time, but i need a vacation, and i think this is when it is actually suited to be said, i miss it i miss it so much. here is the bad lands, NOT the grand canyon, its in south dokota. cowboys used to hide out here, no one would find them, because no one would want to even attempt to navigate or travel this land. it doesn't have a map and no street signs.

"event","THIS IS FUCKED UP. i dont know if i have extra sensory bullshit or what, or god decided to punish me for not wanting to take an exam...see below, how i wish i could have an illness so i didn't have to take the exam. well around three oclock that night, i fuckin started having this unbearable pain in my stomache. followed by a crooked back, i could barely walk, i was like eeehh. whatev, it's nothin, just you know GAS bubble or somethin. so i went to sleep woke up and the pain was still there intensified, and nausiating. so i figured, CONSTIPATION...gotta be. i mean nothing ever goes wrong with me, im sturdy. then i felt all fainty i just watched tv all day laid in bed thinking it would go away before three oclock so i could go to school and take my exam. it just got worse and i felt like i was going to faint. so i called my mom at four oclock she took me to the hospital. worst hospital in the world. i felt so scared. i dont like being poked and proded by a bunch of degenerates. they thought i was pregnant or i was on drugs. i fainted, and thats when they decided to take me back, not because my tempterature was fuckin 95 degrees and my heart rate was rediculously high. oh no. but i got put back there had to drink some nasty shakes for a cat scan. anthony and my mom sat there with me. thats when it got worse after they hooked the i.v. up to me and shit, like an hour after i fainted, i just started freakin the fuck out like i was possesed or something. it hurt so bad, ive never felt like that before, it felt like my insides were constricting to half their size and then going back and doing it again and again. so they shot me up with some good paint killers and i shut up. i finished the shake. they took a cat scan, they told me i had blown a cyst on my ovary. NICE. and that there was fluid and blood in my stomache that needs to be absorbed. i was kinda psyched about gettin that knarly scar that you get when you have appendicitis. instead i got defective ovaries. COOL. atleast i got fingered like eleven hundred times. and now i have REAL track marks and not fake ones. also i got fucked up for free, thanks insurance! apparently a lot of people get cysts and shit, just not everyone's EXPLODE. that really sucked. now im sitting here with a belly full of blood and gook. feeling like shit. they wanted to keep me an extra day but i said nah nah nah. i NEED to go home. i couldn't stand this old italian bitch next to me. ""noorrse nooorrse"". but all in all im glad i got put in there, i fuckin hate hospitals and i fuckin hate doctors, thats my bitter side talking. but really, i mean who is gonna hold you up when you need to go to the bathroom, bring you food, they may be getting paid for it, but they are some awesome people you know that some of them are. when you are scared and shit, even though most of them are kooky sons of bitches, they are nice, i guess because they have to be, but they are taking care of people....and that is very very awesome. so two thumbs up to doctors especially the indian ones, because they are the kindest, and most thorough. just seems as if the white male doctors were fuckin cocky as shit, and acted like they knew exactly what was going on instead of testing you, and the white women, well they were just stupid as fuckin shit. couldn't take my blood was poking my god damn muscle. that reaaaaaaaaaaallly sucked. but im all good now. atleast that sucker is gone, i dont have anymore, or so the catscan showed. who really knows. i didnt even know i had this one. i thought i was cyst free. whatev. moral of the entire experience is, the only time you can get free drugs and hand jobs is when you really don't want them!"

"event","well so far, im trying to keep my head up yeah it fuckin blows, i know it could be worse, but being a human is the hardest fight of them all. just trying to keep collected so you can fend off anything that comes your way...well its fuckin tiring. im quitting smoking, as i've said a thousand times, but im sick of saying stuff and not doing it. im quitting smoking because its one of the only things i can look forward to, maybe this is why people believe in jesus, because the human spirit is so sickening we have to believe in something greater for us to be strong. i can't look forward to shows, because it seems as if no one is there for anything besides dick, vagina, beer, and looking cool (to get dick or vagina or look better than another dick or vagina so they can get the dick and vagina). looking cool includes dressing dirty or as like someone else, and well apparently they have also resided to the primitive violence of the sole, if the chances are that i can kick your ass and win, or as it would be outside of civilization, kill you...then obviously i am better. really its luck of the draw, so nothing is proven except you just made the population smaller. school sucks, i have the hardest fucking classes known to man, i should fuckin work at NASA when i am done and NOT teach a fuckin highschool class, because with all this knowledge and fuckin hard ass work, and extreme amounts of time put into finding out how many fuckin dollar bills can reach the god damn moon. im totally going to fuckin fail my physics exam, and i have no one to blame except for the inept education of Florence Twp. HIGH, and my consistent slacking off with keeping up with the physics homework. i suck so much dick. so far i have told you that my social life which included pretty much going to shows, and meeting strangers BLOWS DICK AND BALLS, mind you all of my friends besides the ones I DONT SEE, fuckin have changed, which i completely expect that to happen, because it has my whole life, duh, happens all the time to the weak. jake is completely different, of course, thats always happened, but atleast i  had him around to laugh at, and well joke around like a little brother or something, then i had my big bro jesse, then he started getting all incest on me, so now everything has been weird ever since he started acting as if we went out, which im sure in later years he will be reminicent of our time as if we were a couple, which really ticks me off. 
<br>
today i studied at the library for 4 hours, then i decided i better go home before it gets too late because i had to ride my bike down to the train station because my car is a peice of shit and well its compeltely done almost. so i get to my bike, some little black kids are telling me i have a busted ass bike, lucky for them i've had a terrible week so i told them to shut the fuck up and they started laughing. i guess because i can't talk to little kids like that without a smile, FUCK i hate not being able to be mean or truely upset, i guess if that was the case i'd prolly kill myself, but on with it. i come home i start studying and of course my mom is talking to me about work, my heroine addict aunt. and i said good she sucks i hope she dies because she left two little girls and her husband to be with some old fuck dude and do drugs all day. oh well. and then my mom took that to heart because she did drugs and she somehow thinks that everyone who does drugs should be sympathized with and like have their fuckin ass wiped for them because they are sick, well im sick of it. and im sick of the bullshit my mom brings up almost on a daily basis, she sits there and ALWAYS brings up that time from when i was about 15-18, how my dad was the cause of her doing drugs. well no, its because you are a fuckin RETARD, and you fucked up you married a fuckin stupid asshole, and the only reason your marriage works out is because he works thirteen hour days, and you dont see him and you smoke all his money away. so whatever. before you were just using a more expensive drug. thank god you only see each other when its time to fuck. because you only liked him because he had a huge weiner, and he only liked you because you had huge titties. isn't that always the case. i love being the by product of two of the most WACKED people in the fuckin universe. so i was explaining to her that the reason why i said i hoped my aunt died (she was married into the family not blood if that matters to anyone) or atleast i said i hoped she got her fuckin good for nothing ass up and payed some fuckin child support like the judge ordered her to do, but my uncle isn't taking any from her....is because you have to PROVE that you are a mother, you have to work hard at it everyday. and if you fuck up, you have to apologize and work hard at NOT fucking up. because whether you would like to think so or not YOUR LIFE IS OVER WHEN YOU POP OUT THEM BABIES. well yeah i forgot what i was talking about i decided to communicate with a human life about my stupid problems instead of writting it on here....the main thing i was saying was mom's suck, town's suck, boyfriends suck, physics sucks, procrastination is dumb, drugs and knives suck. and well....everything sucks right now...i wish i was somewhere were humans didn't exist. now i understand why that old man thearou went to go live in the woods among nature, and he always said the only drink of a smart man is water...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH someone give me a free place to stay and study, and someone else pay for my college....please. i want out of here. maybe i should contemplate on getting a sugar daddy since love and trust don't exist on the same relm in my world. which means i can't love, because i dont trust anyone. and well love can suck on it. my family doesn't love shit, they don't love each other, and i can just see the same shit happening with me. im this extremely loving emotional person who is just looking for someone to be able to trust enough with this immense amount of love. it's funny my name means ONE WITH GREAT LOVE, or DESERVING OF GREAT LOVE. i'd like to find someone who i can trust with it....not gonna happen. too many stupid bullshitters and well dicks are just vagina hungry. and i would just like to be at peace for once in my life. i've been fighting for a long long LONG time and thats why i always look for it in relationships. i should stop. and i should stop looking for it in community based relms outside of the general society (i.e. punk rock). i should stop searching for it in truths and facts because they cannot be trusted either. and plus they suck trying to understand them. i should stop trying to look for it in friendships because they are too illusive and never concrete enough. in my family this trust for love has never existed because my family was started by two people who did not trust and love each other to begin with....i do not trust or love my family and i do not trust or love this world. i am really ticked off right now. and i just really want to leave. but of course anthony left his phone somewhere and he can't take the time to KNOW my number and call me from another phone so i can leave this fuckin house and relax, and besides that i dont want to just go to another place where i dont trust the person either. i would like to take lots of money, get out of here, go live somewhere and do art for a long time until i feel as if its time to go back to school, or i have enough money to go back...and have a place where i can study in peace, without some lunatic talking to me constantly, a place to retriete with the one and only person who has ever cared about me, and that is me. all of this is why i am quitting smoking stupid fucking cigarettes. even though, they are what i turn to when i am this stressed out...but fuck it. i dont need them and i dont need anyone else. realization is a fuckin asshole. the only thing that seriously matters to me right now is doing well in school. well that and as gay as it sounds, rollerderby, only two things i can be proud of."

"event","OH MAN so school has begun. it's going well also because im spending significant time on reading the material instead of going home and smoking my weight in marijuana. man if i actually put my mind to it, im pretty smart, figuring out equations and whatnot...we'll see in later years of this chemistry bullshit exactly how good i am at it. physics is actually very awesome, it's better than chemistry because its all math and not dealing with any chemicals, just dimensions and bullshit...so you don't have to memorize anything except some equations and units of lenghts and masses and shit. i didn't know that perfect kilograms were kept safe in some labratory and there is some clock that is the MASTER OF ALL CLOCKS in france of course, damn franks (new word), it's a cesium atomic clock, and it's like a grandfather clock except with a cesium atom (very small) and it oscillates (swings back and forth)it will neither gain nor loose a second (how would it loose, i dont know, kind of scary, thats definently what we call TIME TRAVEL) in 20,000,000 YEARS!!!!!!!!! insanity. we aren't even going to be around for that long. and thats not even the most acurate, nothing that we know of is acurate it is just well usable and convient. kinda gay huh? kinda gay im going to have to memorize this shit, and the hairless beings of the future will say how dumb i was for studying and spending my life doing it, but hey without our knowledge their knowledge wouldn't have a foundation to run on so...enough nerdom for right now, but i feel excited like how i haven't in years about learning, i guess all you have to do is realize everything else is pretty much bullshit/social life/people/alcohol/weed/friends/boyfriends...all of it is bullshit, the only friend is FACT, the only love is science. another thing that i found very enlightening is that some nobel prize winning scientists were also artists! like me. i guess when you pay attention to detail that much in your life you are able to have the patience it takes for art. maybe i'll become a better artist, or it will soar my creativity through the roof, or train me to stay indoors for hours at a time donig nothing but a project. thank god i'm only twenty, i've got a lot to do. hopefully i don't die.

<br>
on to more important matters, DREAMS. fucked up dreams,i dont know why i am having so many, maybe it's because i slam a couple beers back beforehand, and or i've got this incredibly overactive imagination. so i was sleeping at anthony's when i woke up at four in the morning from stupid shit, i can't sleep when i have an unsolved problem, i remember in the brady bunch remake how they said ""you never fall asleep with a unsolved problem"" well i think that is how he said it, mr. brady. i woke up from this weird ass dream and because i was super frustrated for some unknown reason.... i remember i would do that when i was little, i couldn't sleep when my dad would leave or he would be at the bar, or my mom was at work. terrible. but i had this dream that me and steve hoens and a bunch of our friends were in seperate cars going across this bridge. and for some reason there was small tornados coming our way, there was like three small ones and i was like ""i remember seeing this in nebraska all the time don't worry we will be o.k."" and then a HUGE tornado came and it blew the frame off the car and everyone els'es but the seats were left and we got up and walked across the bridge, we went to some party that my aunt was at and a bunch of people i didn't know in this really nice house. i was looking for anthony but got caught up talking to some attractive and flustered mom, i dont' know why there was so much emphasis on her being attractive in my head, i guess its because i was watching the O.C. (FUCK) earlier and the mom that has an alcohol problem, she's super attractive an di was thinking i'd like to see some mom like that shiiiiiit, YEAH RIGHT, bitch is like a fuckin toothpick. but anyhew...i woke up from the dream and could barely sleep...it was really dumb. and i hated it, the tornado was scary. i have no idea what to do, what to do at all. for once in my life i am positively sure of what i want and of course it's unattainable. i mean there is so much i want to do with my life, and im sure i'll get bored of all of the above, and i know humans can never be completely content with anything, but i feel completely content being with anthony, i mean i dont know, i just never laughed so much, felt so comfortable, and just was so sure. i've never EVER been sure in my life of love, i've always either been jealous, or wanting something else, or bored of it, or pissed, or just plain didn't believe in it, never thought i would actually be sure of something. but whatever, i guess i can feel that way later on, and we'll see how things go, until then i can't bother myself over it, because i won't get any sleep, and i won't be manda, i'll be oversensitive amanda, and if life has taught me one thing, it's to not give a fuck, because when you do, well you are just going to be bitter and pissed. if i gave a fuck that my parents didn't care about me for about ten good years of my life, i'd be bitter and probably a stripper by now, or a runaway drug addict. or just a drug addict in general. AND I DONT HAVE ISSUES, i just like to talk about my stupid problems....and you don't have to fuckin read it assmunchers. but yeah...i guess i do have some issues, i love too much. but i think i'm alright really, im not too psycho, i wouldn't kill myself over someone or cry for days on end.

"event","i had a couple weird ass dreams last night. i moved into this awesome old house, i have no idea where it was at, but with a couple other people, as i can remember. there was this old fat greasy dude, who wouldn't stop trying to get with me. all i remember was being stationary on the couch, i couldn't move, he kept touching me and going down my pants, and i was crying. i got up and there was period blood all over the couch, he chased me up the stairs. i got away. then it jumped to me getting the room with the porch. somehow i ALWAYS have a dream about the ocean, waves in particular, and HUGE waves too. personally i think it's just because the ocean scares the fuck out of me, or it seems a way out. because when i locked the door to stay away from my weirdo pervert rapist roomate there came a huuuuuuuuge wave....and the house got flooded all the way to the what seemed like the tenth floor...i was up really high and i jumped off the house after the wave left, i jumped really far down and caught a banister like how they do in movies...instead of splattering on the ground. i ran away, and i came back home...my little kitten boss hog, had another kitten trying to tear out of his back from inside of him...so i ran away and got some supplies to fix him....it was really disturbing, not as disturbing as getting unwillingly fingered in my own fucking DREAM, but i think it came from watching these maggots crawl out of a cricket body that a fly placed its eggs in and killed....well it really scared the shit out of me, so i tryed to cut open boss hog and kill the other cat....but i eneded up killing them both, and for some unknown reason someone told me i shoudl of been a doctor somewhere in that dream. so far, i've came to the conclusion, watching television alone will put memories in your head never inteded, and it does shape who you are...so watch what you watch. because if such things enter your dream world, enter  your memory, they are imprinted and remembered for all enternity. and when you die, well...all of your thoughts spill all over, and the last seconds of your imaginary visuals, you know when you close your eyes and see things, or imagine them, or dream in other words....well...do you really want them to be episodes of laguna beach...no. no you don't. maybe my mind is trying to tell me i should of been a surfer....."

"event","A couple strange occurances have happened to me in the past week or so. well...i guess maybe not THAT strange...anyhew... friday i was just outside of medusa, a bar next to the first unitarian church, a man that has muscle distraphy wheels up, (he's in a wheel chair, i very well couldn't of said WALK, that would of been rude, and well not correct by any means) i was waaaaaay wasted, i dont even know how either, i only took one shot, and maybe i just was downing beers left and right and didn't even really notice. but i was talking to him asking him where he went to school and so on. and i kept makin stupid jokes and then trying to high five him, and he would say ""i can't lift my arm"" so i'd low five him. I DID THAT A COUPLE TIMES IM SUCH A FRIGGEN ASSHOLE. but i was drunk so i think he excused me, in fact i KNOW he excused me because the later part of the night he rolled up to me and told me i was ""so sexy"". implying he could feel ""above the knees"". WELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL now. i just put my head down and tried not to cry from the akwardness, and here i felt so bad for trying to high five the dude, and all he's thinking is ""SHES TALKING TO ME, SHE""LL DEFINENTLY SLEEP WITH ME"" oh the world we live in today. can't even make friends without someone, well pictureing you butt ass naked. especially being a female in this world, really blows. you dont know what it feels like when old men are staring at you, or someone tells you that they want you to sit on their face, and they are atleast twice your age. makes you not want to ever look at your father the same way...or males in general. anyhew... past the topic of overactive sexualism...well...i dont really know, how to explain it. and i dont know how it is. i was wondering if because we are at the TOP of the food chain, we balance things out with murder/rape/societal disfunction. thats why things like when i walk into a wawa or something, someone is rude, and someone is trying to do someone, or someone is trying to just go for it. all for one and one for all...nah. every man for himself. and well...at derby practice they kept saying ""don't hit like a girl"" i was like ""NOOOO, im going to hit like a girl, and it's gonna fuckin hurt, DUH retards, i thougth thats what we were all about, showin that chicks can kick some mother fuckin ass too"". 
<br>
when i got out of wawa, there was a bag of chronic ontop of a garbage....i wondered...is there someone watching and waiting for this, because its blantenly on a fuckin garbage can outside of a wawa in public view....and i wondered, could i take it? and i thought no. so i drove off. i was thinking, WHAT WAS I THINKING. there was a FREE BAG OF WEED, i could of taken the day off from work and sold that shit to cullen or someone....smoked it first to see if i would die or not, because it might of been poisoned you know...but still...i was like, adn that is growing up. you have ""poison"" ""death"" ""police"" ""parents"" constantly in your head, i really think parents have a lot more to do with  your life when you are older than when you are younger, yeah they'll let you do more things, but they are WAAAAAAAY more on your case about ""being an adult"" than ""being good"" when you were a kid. because they always said ""he's just a kid"" so they would let you off. now it's all on you, and they are constantly in your head ""don't steal that, remember when i picked you up from the police station"". before i didn't have that good for nothin voice in my head telling me not to do ""wrong"" things. DAMNIT, i dont want to grow up. i dont want to not steal anymore. hahahahah this is terrible, im trying to force myself to steal...i guess this is growing up...mxpx, remember that shit...i think thats mxpx...really i dont know...you know what...fuck that shit. that shit was probably poisoned and you know what...some douche cop was prolly just waitin for someone to pick it up...and then they could make a hit...so i was smart. i dont know why i question myself sometimes."

"event","The four girls and I arrived at the last house to clean. An elderly spanish lady lives there, with pictures of her family all over, and a permenent smile on her face. My boss opened the door and a woft of the stalest shit smell raced at our faces like a pack of wolves towards a child wandering in the woods with a bloodied arm. Great, the old lady must of been trying to walk towards the bathroom, and there was shit at the top of the stairs in the halway. Of course scattered. Which brings to mind two things, why can't humans be more like dogs and instead of TRYING to make it to the bathroom, realize, HEY, I can't, i'll just leave it in one pile and squat on this here floor. Also it brought to mind, WHO THE FUCK IS GONNA CLEAN THAT SHIT UP??? IT SURE AS HELL ISN""T GOING TO BE ME, made me wonder why any of her sons that were pictured on that there wall should of been there to do the job. Thank god we didn't have to bicker over who would do the dirty business, and my boss took some paper towels and we to town on the trail of defication. Of course the stupid bitch had to say something, ""if i don't get into heaven for this."" Made me think more about why humans fucking suck worse than their shit smells, because there we go again with her self absorbed bullshit. 
 
My boss ordered me down stairs with the vaccum, so i proceeded. While vacuming, and really the entire time at work all i do is sift through thoughts in my head, mostly terrible ones that make my stomache ache. I don't take tums, and we don't go on lunch break, so my overactivly acidic stomache just burns and burns away as my thoughts just feed it with what seems to be battery acid, or feels like. So I went with the thoughts about how my boss blows for being self absorbed because the first thing she thought of when she was cleaning up that old womans shit wasn't about how sad it was that this woman is shitting the rest of her life away, and how she is in her bedroom unaware she has a shit covered ass, but how great she is because she cleaned it up, and how she should go into heaven. (yeah you can tell i vemently hate my fuckin boss, and really everyone). She didn't even clean it all up, she just placed papertowels over it and picked up the turds. 
 
My first thought was, i will always be there for my mother or father when they become like that, because they wiped my ass forever. Accually just to spite my father because the thinks that raising a family is slaving at the fuckin office for thirty million hours a week, and coming home and handing us money. I laugh at this thought, because I am pretty sure that macho fuck didn't touch my ass as a baby, because thats a ""woman's job"". So i'll just settle for leaving stacks of cash next to him on a night stand, and when he wants something to drink, or he needs help getting up or a bathroom, well ill just let him shit there, and hopefully some woman will walk by, or my mom won't be decrepid enough to help him out. fuckin macho mother fucker. One thing i am sick of. 
   
Then patriarchy ideals starting swirling around in my massive cranium, and really the idea of being infantile and shitting yourself, began me thinking about anthony. Ussually the smell of shit doesn't spark thoughts of signifigant others, in my case the recent ex-boyfriend everytime i smell some fat bastard in front of me at a pizze place who obviously hasn't washed in say five months, or if i was to get a close smell of their balls, yeah that would definently rev the reminisint motor. I started thinking about how anthony said i lecture. Maybe i am boring and nagging, or rather annoying and nagging, because i can be entertaining, maybe not in a good way, but you can always go home and say ""man i just sat back and listened to this psycho talk, and she seriously went on for say, an hour about the dumbest shit, i can't believe people think of shit like that"". Well half the time i can't believe what other people think, so hey its a trade mother fuckers. I can't stop though, so thats why im becoming a teacher, so i can sit there and lecture the youth of america about how much of assholes they all are, and how they go through everyday life just not even thinking or using their logic and reason, the two things that help EVERY ANIMAL. its instinct it's not something that came with fuckin civilization, logic and reason, logic and reason. 

Then i went up stairs to vacum the hallway and noticed that Ida (my boss) had placed two large books on top of the paper towels to hold them down from the fan blowing. Well, i had to take a look because irony is everywhere in my life, that's why i keep myself from kicking the bucket from underneathe of my feet, because well its just too fuckin funny not to see all you dumb assholes do something completely fucking stupid, or just hear the shit that comes out of your mouths, completely boggles my mind. Well, one of them just HAPPENED TO BE THE BIBLE! hahahahah OH MAN great stuff great stuff. LOVE IT LOVE IT. yeah you'll get into heaven, but one thing you forgot YOUR SACRED BOOK YOU SHOULD NEVER SIT ON TOP OF OLD LADY SHIT YOU DIDN""T FULLY CLEAN UP YOU INWARD FUCK. love it. love it.

so what i learned is more shit came out of my boss' mouth than was on the floor. Also, that poor old lady has pictures of her sons to stare at, while she is sitting in her own shit, and they should be there wipping it, as she had done when they were coming into the world. Think of it as a journey, as if you are starting your trip, and you need someone there to pack it up, tell you how to get there (such as maps, and or they tell you of landmarks), they tell you about all the great resteraunts ect... for the rest of the journey you are pretty much on your own to enjoy it, then on your way out, its hard to pack up all that shit, you all know what it's like to go to the beach, it always seems like you have more on the way out. Well you need someone to help you carry that cooler and those towels. Either way, you should wipe your parents ass when you get older, if they were good to you. If they weren't, well, let them fuckin sit in it, because they get whats comin to them, they made you sit in shit your whole life. And that my children is HELL ON EARTH, the real payback and justice, a shitty ass. 

More about how i nag, and or lecture. i would like to ask everyone to be truthful with me, do i get annoying with my shit, do i sound like a haughty taughty bitch, as if i know more than everyone else...well it's because i do. and you should listen to me. because the two key senses that i use in everday life more than awarness, sight, hearing, because if you haven't noticed i often have trouble listening, i have trouble being aware, hence the bruises all over, im one clumsy mother fucker, and well sight goes hand in hand with that. i use my thoughts, logic and reason above all, maybe i was an old chinese scholar back in the day. they grew out their nails really long, the didn't write or anything, all they did was come up with ways in which to help people through life, and help them realize how rediculous they were being. i just gotta be able to cut this shit down to about three sentences, then it would be easier, all of their adtages were about a sentence long. i can't realy do that. and since they didn't write, because of their nails, and they believed they were too great to do any human communication other than speaking, even that was rare too, hence how i can't spell and or seperate my paragraphs, well and my grammer is terrible. i still have the stench stuck inside my nostils from that house, bleh. i need to like smoke a cigarette out of each nostril, and or take a shower. 

ON ANOTHER NOTE:

just two days ago, sunday, man arms tells me that some dude asked her if she wanted to go to the smithville mansion because they were filming some horror movie. we got there, and i guess it was too late, or someone else was there, and they couldn't do anything. she gets there yesterday morning, and no one is there but that dude and two other huge black dudes. he takes her to the house and he was like ""come inside let me show you the tenth floor"". luckily man arms isn't dumb, she brought someone with her, and she noticed that there was trash all over the floor and it didn't seem as if there was a staff there, or anything, so she was like fuck you, im leaving. and he of course tried to coax her in, then he said he was filming a music video. like i said, luckily she isn't dumb, and she didn't fall for it, so she left. he obviously is working on a rape project, and because of the tone of man arms' voice he probably assumed her nieve. TOO FUCKIN BAD SUCKER YOU FUCKIN PEICE OF FUCKIN SHIT. im getting a fuckin knife. i swear. i always hated people who carried around weapons, but fuck that, this world is getting to crazy, and too fucking ""fend for yourself"" and well im better at fending off a huge black man if i can get all stabby on their ass. plus i go to places that are in need of some protection, and i would rather not live in fear, and avoid going to those places. i would rather go wherever the fuck i want, when i want, but have a back up plan just incase, and that would be the big awesomly sharp blade. i dont even give a fuck if it isn't legal, cuz if some stupid pig has a problem with it, i'll be like...yeah and YOU can protect me. because man arms called the cops today to inform them that there is some stupid pervert trying to coax girls into one of the back houses at the mansion so he can live out his power cravings. either that or he was making a snuff film. the cops of course said she would have to go there in person and make a complaint. she was like ""i just you want you to send like a cop or two there to make sure that there isn't something going on in the way back house, and make sure that no one else is gonna get hurt, because i luckily didn't get hurt"". of course they couldn't do anything. but of course for a noise complaint they can go and fuckin knock on your door and ruin your party time. I LOVE THIS WORLD WE LIVE IN, SO MUCH LOGIC AND REASON...that makes a WHOLE LOT OF FUCKIN SENSE NOW DOESN""T IT. whatever. 

ON A MUCH LIGHTER AND BETTER NOTE:
i went to chris whaley's on sunday night because i had monday off from work. we picked up some schlitz, a six pack each, a six pack of mike's hard lemonade, and two forties. we drank and talked and talked all serious, then we talked about memories from when i was eighteen, and chris was practically living at my house. then fetus and steph started falling asleep. they went up stairs, and nun and chris were left downstairs with me. i ended up knocking over the coffee table because chris wouldn't stop letting out these lethal farts, so i punched him, broke a glass. then chris went to sleep and tom came home from working at the gay bar, with a case of beers. nun, tom, and i drank drank, went through like three movies. none of which we watched, at the end it was empire strikes back, adn we were still talking about how much we hate our fathers, and how homosexual each of us were, or how not homosexual each of us were. overall, i needed that, and so does everyone else. thats why way back in the day they didn't have people that were called psychiatrists, your fuckin shrink were your two best friends, who were equally fucked up and a bottle of wine. we stayed up until eight, tom went to go get food, and came home with a shitload of junk food, and me and nun passed out. we woke up and got some awesomly free food from joe. it was a good day. i miss hanging out and just doing nothing really special with my friends and just talking. we didn't have weed either. just some beers and some cigs and a whole lot of problems. 

i love life because of you guys. and no matter what, i will always treat you the best i can."

"event","well hello. seems i only write in here when i am either pissed about something, or i'd like to repeat my stupid bullshit over and over again. or write things i really don't want people to read in here. it's like how everyone really wants you to find their journal in their room. its true. its why there are so many family/early teen sitcoms that involve some boyfriend or some leekage from the diary. it's because really we want everyone to know everything about us. its a breath of fresh air. right? it means you have nothing to hide. privacy the first right taken when living in family units and or any other sort of social dwelling. if you are hangin around any of the sort...you know your shit is AIIIRRRED BITCH. unless of course the few shreds of secrecy you hold. like the couple minutes that you get when no one is home and you get to lock the door and fuckin have sex with yourself. point is. im loosing it. but they always say, if you proclaim that you are crazy, then you most likely cannot be. mental patients never believe that they should accually be there, unless on drugs. you know how they say ""losing your mind"". he lost his mind. i remember in the dance hall crashers song about their friend ""shelly"" so sad. i thought about that song all the time. now i think that every single person around me is insane. i dont know if its just my pessimistic attitude and why im only thinking about relating certain situations to ska songs right now i have no idea...it's the ADD that kicks in when i start to get upset. it's a function i think that us kids started to try and tune out that bullshit the teachers were feeding us, and the televisions feed us, and our parents feed us. fucking parents why won't they shut up paaaaareeeents their so fucked up.....decendents, and before that i was thinking of PMA song by potshot i believe it was...positive mental attitude...i try and keep that. it doesn't work out so well. maybe i'm bipolar to, but i won't go to the doctors for it, no no, i figure its like a mental douche, bipolar, schizophrenia. most of these diseases are caused by trama in their life. see so they are mearly flushing their problems away with other problems like why their are imaginary people standing around them. or why they get so mad over the price of bacon raising. they don't have to think about how their dad would beat the fuck out of them and do their mother in front of them and take them to strip clubs at the age of twelve. no, you have that yellow banana talking to worry about it. like now, i just talk and talk and talk and i don't slow myself down to think that wow amanda you wanted to write about how you were pissed about cops, boss', parents, boyfriend. everything really. and most importantly i am upset with myself. i am better than all this bullshit. i have done nothing in my life that has rendered the bullshit givin to me. no. i feel like an angry black women empowered...i guess thats really what all of us invision when we get empowered....that or we see god...god is an angry black woman...now that would explain everything. no no back on track....so my boss is a shit, but looking for a job blows even more, now this is why i am upset with myself. i have to keep working to pay off that ticket. i should just put my all in to getting the fuck up and getting the fuck out. i shouldn't concern myself socially with others, that brings nothing but wasted time, and bullshit relations that end up no where but you well...i think instead of having frieds or anyone close, i would rather live a life where i get paide twenty bucks a pop to have a sick fuck shit on my chest. real respectable job, can't wait to tell daddy thats how i got enough money to pay for insurance for the car. fuckin creep fuck fuck fuck. yeah so the point is my dad was yelling at me for all the shit that he pays for...blah blah blah last night because i got a speeding ticket. well like i said a thousand times fucker, i didn't ask to be here. nope, i'm not the one who couldn't keep my dick in my pants. no, so too bad fucker, until i start to have the ability to appreciate life, you are gonna pay yeaaaaaaaah thats what its all about, when you fuck a bitch, your gonna pay one way or another. either an std, either money, or a kid. or your gonna have a bitch whinning to call you the next day. so you must pay her a phone call. it's all hustle hustle in this life. it's all buy and sell people can't you see! our shit is modeled right after our very own way of socially interacting with one another. you don't give a fuck unless you are getting something out of it. or so it seems. it's all about ticklin our fancies. yeah. it sure is. all you fuckers. it makes all those warm fuzzy images of fire places at christmas time, and all the bullshit love stories of belle falling in love with a beast and shbladow he's a fuckin hot peice of meat. no...it's not like that in life. the beast would either have like a seven chick baggage and a case of syphallis (spelling, as you can tell i don't give a fuck about, you can still read it assholes, if you are all the way down here, which im sure you aren't...im sure you are sick of it, and are like wow, she's a crazy fuckin bitch...read on if interested). i enjoy concerning myself with ""what lives at the bottom of the ocean floor, what kind of monsters are down there"" really i picture just teeth. a big huge mouth is at the very bottom of the ocean floor. and the ocean is the mouth's saliva....either think about something else or pretend it's ok. pretend when you are a kid is awesome. why this image of purity exists. everything is fucked up. relationships, family, friends....everything that is supposed to mean something. i could always sell myself out, leave everything and everyone behind and try and make something of myself. i could use my shit. i wouldn't knwo where to start. well first i would start at taking millions of hours out of my life to school myself and become a deep ocean diver...a marine biologist. i could die doing an exploration down to the depths of the ocean with my hypothesis of a giant mouth. but i could, i could do anything i want. when i wanted straight hundreds in elementry school. i would do it. i would read college books. i would memorize them. i would sit inside all day. but see i started to get caught up in friends. because i had so much fun, i thought hey, these four girls they are gonna see my kids grow up, they are gonna see me go to college. negatory. one did, andrea. but boy have we been in lots of fights. i dont expect everthing to be perfect at all. infact i enjoy the stupid bullshit...but at the same time, i would like some AWESOME and not SHIT to keep happening. i just got out of a relationship with someone who was lazy as hell. i did not understand him, i tried really hard to. i tried really hard to understand why i would continue giving him money to come down to see me on the train, and he worked like once every two weeks, dropped out of highschool, i would go to my classes i would go to work and i would just expect him one day to want to care, or like want to do something extroidinary for me, like that one time i threw pj a surprise party in my basement, it just gave me a feeling that was awesome...i was so excited to just give him a celebration that was unwarranted...you know..i just thought everyone would have the same feelings as me...the want or need to do something nice for others, and the feeling that you get afterwards, i thought that was something to work for. and i dont care...but honestly, when i am busting my ass all day rubbing my knees raw on bathroom floors and i come home, i mean like make a card for me, or something. i would always leave my mom cards when she would come home from work everyday when i was little. because i loved her and i wanted her to know over and over agian...thats why i thought anthony was so awesome, because he left me a card on my car the day after i kissed him. i was like...wow, thats really awesome...he thought about me, and he wanted me to know that. and not just cuz it said that inside...hah. i've had a terrible week, i broke my window, had to pay a speeding ticket, worked all week with no pay because my boss is on vacation. so we are running her business for her while on the beach, she is rackin in a g while im workin everyday....fuckin whore slut, i came home after work everyday to a ferret strategically placing his asshole out of one of the spaces in the god damn cage and shitting on the ground...because my mom, it's her god damn ferret, leaves a huge shit pile in the corner, and for some reason this animal has designated spots in his cage to be the bathroom and refrigerator and water, each in a seperate corner. smart weasle. so i come home to animal shit, dirty dishes, dirty laundry, a mom and sister tokin it up in the bedroom. my mom got home at twelve, sister doesn't have a job. so i do all this shit, fold their clothes do the dishes, clean the bathroom. thinking im gonna get some sort of like lax or like reward, like i dunno i just expect something. i would do it regardless, but thats just fucked up...more like cinderella. a nicer image...brighten this post up a bit. however i will not have a fuckin carriage nor a god damn lost glass slipper...or awesome mouse friends. see...she was nuts, crazy bitch imagining mice talkin to her. i bet you if they found the lost sea scripts of cinderella, they would find she was schizophrenic and imagined all this right before commiting suicide at twelve. yeah...just kidding. it's not the bible or nothing. back to what i was talking about. i was sick last week, and my mom was asking me to do something after i got home from work at three/animal shit/ dirty everything ect....so i got pissed and threw my hairbrush, well if i had a god damn screen that someone cough cough rachel cough didn't take out of my room when she took it over when i moved out...it wouldn't of broken. but because of the gypsy curse...i broke a two hundred dollar fuckin window. sparked my dad's anger, i broke two phones...found out some shit im not to happy about with a friend. and well i haven't had a good two months lets just say. then today, thinking i would catch a break...i see anthony and he is in a bad mood. it seemed as if he wanted to fight with me. and i don't know how to act anymore. i don know if i am crazy. or if i am nieve...or i try to hard with people. i give them too many chances...all because i don't want to believe that people can be that irrational or just fucking plain out saying, well fuuuuuuuuuck you and your kindness, fuck you and your problems, well manda just plain out fuck you. well no FUCK YOU ASSHOLE. see thats the stuff rockers are made of, it's like that movie she devil ""i thought girls like us stick together""....""hey i thought people like us stuck together"" case in point...thrown around white suburbanites...children of the service sector. all of the above....i was a magnet to your abrasive language, pissed of attitudes, and well all around fuck you. i needed a whole lot of that being a quite drawn child with bullshit happening in my life. stupid parents...stupid everything. and to this day, i thougt you know you grow out of it...twenty and still here, still fucking pissed. i dont think it ever ends....if you don't get pissed, its like...you either loose respect for yourself, or the standards that you hold for others. or you fall into place. i dont really know where im going with this WHOLE GOD DAMN ENTRY. really, to tell the truth, im the most mixed up. its like i've just been hit left right left right in the brain. like my eyes are going to deflate and my heart like it's holding hands with my stomache for love. you fall in love, you are born, and you have to deal with shit, you'd rather not. but i guess you get something out of it....wow, see that view was changed in seconds..i walked away and smoked a cigarette and already im thinking differently....i have the worst case of A>D>D. i started to slow down on smoking, but i keep giving myself excuses to do it...like im pissed. so i do it. well im gonna be pissed guarenteed for a good amount of my life, i can't just do that when i want to. so this is what im doing on my night off, writting in livejournal. livejournal...wow, you are there for me in the worst of times, i dont even need an livejournal for you to talk to me...i just need the internet..so i guess you aren't an end all solution...back to the matter at hand...i think i make love an end all solution. love with family/friends/boyfriends. im nieve to think that they hold the same expectations of themselves and their respect and love for me. it's not the same. i love to strong. i should put that shit to something more useful and stop being a hippie, and get rich. fuck a passion, use that energy into trickery, hustle hustle. stop having this fuckin big eyed deer rainbow butterfly outlook on shit, and get down and dirty. like you mean it...fuckin KILL KILL KILL. but no i want to care, i just want to be loved..really.. it's sad and pathetic this post. it's really really lame. and dumb. but i just want someone to try and make me feel better some time. but i become unspecial (and yes thats the best word i could come up with) after a while, or people realize, hey dude she's fuckin thinkin that people accually care, ain't that cute. they have more than themselves to worry about. the grass needs to be cut. the dishes need to be done. i have to make money. i have to eat. must impress. must worry. must report suspicious activity. must learn. must go to school everyday. must get married. must reproduce. you have to love your sister. share. yeah...it's never ending. ive got a lot to do, i have to get off the computer.  

post inspired by: window companies. the need and advancement of special windows. tempers. shitty fathers. shitty lazy people. boss'. crappy asshole inward people. and last but not least my dog chewing up my good shoes, and him getting a better birthday party than me. love the dog, love dog's birthdays. but hate my father yelling at me and then somehow treating a beast better than me....i didn't ask to be here, and that dog you hopefully didn't bring into the world, if you did, i have a lot more to worry about, like being half dog....thats just fucked. but yeah that was really stupid and not funny. but i made myself laugh. 

conclusion: laughing is the most awesome thing. the only thing that keeps me going. if anything life is funny. alanis morriset. i think i got a constant radio playing in my head, i wonder if thats bad. maybe i should try sitting in silence sometimes and slow myself down. to keep up with this world though, you must go a million miles a minute. because you might of missed the party. you might of missed the joke!? what if what if. i like to sit in my room and think about shit. just lay in my bed. thats why i think miraculously i will grow a beard and venture to a top of a hill. and just come up with strange saying to say to passerby's that really mean shit, and the'll think i just made life make sense to them...because of one saying...nah i dont think i'm the type to cut it short...har har har...get it joke about my post being so long....alright i will suck whoever's dick that read this whole entry. just kidding. but it's so long. LONGEST ENTRY EVER. and it doesn't make any sense...at all. but i feel better now.

--really im just pissed..that sums it up, that and ""why wont anyone be nice to me waaaa waaaaahhhh waaaaaah"" im sick of doing shit for other people thinking that its what other people do...remember amanda they forget that in this world we are here for each other, and we aren't here because of ourselves....because with out other people asshole....you wouldn't be shit. but i guess everyone has forgotten that. and i wanted some love and compassion where i thought i could easily find it, where it's supposed to flow freely like the waters of a river ( comparison description, just adding the homofactor ) but i found it had gone dry. and now i'm dry...so im gonna go look at some porn and GET WET. or listen to andrew w.k. for the p.g. version of this entree.. daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaymn my head hurts."

"event","i wake up. still feelin drunk amazingly. its ten o clock, and i feel like shit. AHHH. i didn't have a good sleep at all...i wake up at my house on the couch...WHY ON THE COUCH, WHY NOT ON MY BED. with shit written all over my shirt, hahaha that rules. i forgot about that until seconds after i awoke, and realized, WOW, i have COP FIGHT, on my back...hahahahahah. oh dear. last night was a good show. i had a great time head bangin to the distorted sounds. yes. yes. i did. i also had a good time pondering while i was sleeping, it's the only time i'll allow myself to think of things like this. but i realized i hate mother fuckers who think they know it all, people who believe that their way is the right way, or their beliefs are correct all around. have you ever heard of being humble, or just being rest assured without full proof on a certain topic. if you have it fuckin figured all out, then why dont you just inform the rest of the human race about it, and maybe we can all follow thanks. however....THIS IS NOT THE CASE. becuase you dont know shit. people who talk of fashion for instance, i dont remember when this was broughht up i think by chris whaley, dont ask, but for some reason i had a dream that involved a conversation about this topic. FASHION, is not JUST AN AMERICANIZED THING, and stop using that word as if it means anything, AMERICANIZED..first off, fashion is AN EXTENSION of your personality, just like all those douchey gay dudes say when they are creating all those douchey dresses for their last names. GAY GAY GAY. tribes in africa have FASHION, fashion that extends far beyond the reaches of a super market, they mold branches, make beads, stretch ear lobes and lips. fuck it dude...your a retard. thats all i have to say. people who like to sit on top of an ivory tower, pointing down to the rest of us, or those who like to believe that they are living some sort of NEW way...when in reality, you will either die early, or give up your beliefs to suit your life...because survival comes first, then your faggotry misunderstanding so i can get laid philosophy comes next. stop reading leftist bullshit and repeating everything that you see on the page. this is why nothing ever changes, take time and accually think and dwell on what you are saying like a REAL philosopher would do, and explore every different instance...because you may not be gettin dudes with your looks, thats for fuckin sure. not cuz you smell good, thats also for sure. but you are tryin to hook em with your retart babble, i love how philosophy has become a way of gettin some dick and some pussy. another attribute of humans i despise, the consistent need to either of the two. now, if you will excuse me, i am going to go throw up. i have my first hang over in a long long time."

"event","WELL. watched kingpin with man arms last night. she never saw it. good movie. really good. made me think about amish people, which was weird because apparently when i was passed out in lauren reichert's car on saturday...they met and smacked into an amish dude and his car. he didn't know shit about cars because...well he's fuckin amish. talked to jenny. talked to lauren. seems as if the same shit that pisses me off or the same shit i've been going through since eighth grade won't change. i mean shit...i remember jenny and i...i remember sitting in the bathroom, and this one chick, who will later on in life end up being a body modification, taking back sunday lovin douche thought she was more punk than jenny and i...ha. she was in the bathroom with us and jenny complimented her on her stockings...which were fishnets, we were young as hell, in middle school...and the girl looks at her and says ""they are fishnets, gaaaaaaahhh"" OH JESUS SORRY. she sucks balls sacs now...and did back then. guess who was lovin the music and dancin and not carin, thats right me. i was tryin to make jenny have fun, because shit isn't that what seein music is about. it's the only place in this world where it isn't restrictive, you can do what you want, say what you want, fuck up what you want, if its on accident...you know...it happens. can't do that at a venue where a company owns it. if its DIY you can do whatever you want. i wonder if it's inheret in humans to act as if they need to be better than the next or they feel as if they need to be so exclusive. as if adding more people that haven't been around is going to make it less of a place. i say the more the merrier. and what does that say about our community when you deny someone simply based on their know how of the environment, and or their style/clothing. i say that makes it gay. super gay. sounds like some fuckin douchey rich golfing club that wont let in blacks...or jews. thats what it sounds like to me, a sort of facism if you will...maybe? i remember getting yelled at by some douchey hardcore kid in middle school too at a show because i was wearing my favorite sick of it all t shirt, that matched my hair. i was very fond of this shirt, it was like hundred times my size, and i wore it almost everyday...it ruled. well he told me he was going to rip it off of me hockey style...HOCKEY STYLE...what the fuck. i had no idea what he meant...but ripping a shirt off of a girl, thats sort of rape. is it not. hahaha anyway...yeah...my point is, everyone chill the fuck out and have fun. why do we all gotta hate on each other, or just be bitches...i dont fuckin get it. it's so dumb. our entire life will be richer, more awesome if you just chill out and accept everyone, i accept even the assholes...unless you step a line of course. i just like having fun for five dollars...i dont want to feel like im enrolled in some exclusive hampton club, imagine if they opened their doors to everyone even the poor, it wouldn't be dumb anymore, and everyone could enjoy their whatever in the fuck they have. all i know is borders and boundries consistently break us apart just like the land we section off. it's something that is dumb...and no more border patrol, no more border patrol, no more border patrol. that's what i'll call people from now on that are like that, they are like the punk rock pigs, they delegate who's punk enough, what criteria is necessary to be apart of it. ha. funny guys. love it. soooo dumb. but yeah back to amish people, i thought about it, and i wonder if the amish would be down, for a year, it would be really cool if they let me live with them...if they let me live in the amish community and be apart of them...see how i like it...maybe they can show me how simple and fufilling a life can be without television, computers, cars, all the stupid shit that takes up my time, i study so i can buy. arrrghhh. life is confusing, and i wonder if im wasting it. i'm wasting it for sure writting in this, buying the pack of cigarettes i bought today...doing my hair, looking on myspace...wasting my money at convience stores...wawa...you devil. fuck balls and sac. see i realized that the money i should be spending is only two dollars and twenty cents for the train back and forth to my school...i can walk to the train, or i got a bike...i dont need cigarettes (although i DO), i dont need weed (although most of the time it's free, cept FIVE ON IT), i dont need coffee, i got that shit at home...my parents buy all packaged foods...i hate it. i hate it. i want to feel like i worked at putting something into my mouth, i personalized it with some fuckin spices and shit. i can't wit to move out, get my degree, and start living how i want to live. i want to buy all my food raw...fruits vegetables, huge bags of rice...i want to go home and take two hours cooking something, let it stew, and have a feast. im sick of, open the lean cusine...put it in the microwave...get it out and eat at the kitchen counter and walk away. i think if we worked harder at simple things like eating, instead of making everything convient...thats what i've figured this world is about, convience...how much faster can we get this car, how many retarted thigns can we put inside to make it seem like life is getting easier with all these fuckin add ons and technology, when really it just gets more expensive, and we spend more, work more...for what...so i can have a fuckin space ship for a fuckin car...so i can have a control panel, that tells me where i wanna go. convience makes everything boring...and empty...worthless...i like getting lost...it's scary...like a roller coaster...leads you to weird people and makes for good horror movies...you know? what if they had a fuckin tracking device or a map thingy ma bob, ""ohhh nevermind here's the highway"" and end of movie...see. not good. what we think makes us better or life easier is the other way around...it makes us inward, over worked, and leads to empty relations with others...because we have no time to develop anything. im quitting drinking for a month. i do it every weekend. and i would rather be how i was before...manda...because it's obvious that people think im only that way when im drunk..im not. im tryin not to smoke, and smoke weed everyday...on friday...im finishing my basement...gonna take up a lot of the cat shit trash, and put it out to the garbage men. im going to put a whole awesome studio down there and i want to make an awesome smoking chamber....CHAMBER..hahaha. i want to make a little movie theatre too..i want to ge ta projector with a white sheet...make a couple awesome benches...and presto...movie theatre. maybe if my parents go away, i'll have a show. or even if my parents are here ill have a show with a bbq and shit. it will be awesome. i had a show at my house before, i dont know why i wasn't scared back then of my parents seeing my weird ass friends and them drunk, but i guess i was straight edge and my confidence was through the roof when it came to my parents i was like ""look i dont do drugs, i get good fuckin grades, i can do what i want, whenever i want"" hahaha. i miss the old days, but im happy where i am at now...and i know that if i can find the will power i can change shit...and myself. but first comes me, then the rest of the world...right? i guess so...haha sounds selfish, but i can't make everything else stronger without me being strong too. and that requires not relying on anything, and not wasting my time...using up the precious life for a wawa hoagie, although that sounds delicious...roasted red pepper spread ahhhhhhh. good. but i will learn to make my own way through life without relying on anything that i dont need. and i wont let them make me believe i do need it. nope."

"event","when natalie merchant makes you cry...you feel like a mother fuckin douche. on the way to school i dont have any other form of entertainment besides the radio...no tape player no cd player, im BROKE NIGGA. but natalie merchant came out with a new song...a line in it made me cry. yes cry. i cried alone in my car. because im a stupid hippie. lately i haven't cared about anything, done anything, and im sure i probably wont. but i started thinking...when i read free zines i would pick up at shows and what not, especially the asain man records one i picked up first, plea for peace, it would just fuel my fire, i was young and i just remember always feeling that way. wanting to help. wanting to make everyone happy. wanting to make everything beautiful and awesome. she said concrete creeping a thousand miles at a time. i thought about what july said how they are knocking down woods near her house that were the habitat of bald eagles. now don't get me wrong. usually i have an apathetic i hate everything, fuck you hippie, shut the fuck up stop complaining...i wondered where that stemmed from, because it seems as if i have two sides...i figured it out...i always come to a conclusion but never feel satisfied. i work it out in my head, give me reasons why i have to go to school, i drive my car there, why i dont just start takin a jack hammer to shit, and destroying the new walgreens that is going up in my town (there is one right down the mother fuckin road five minutes away people, and there is a family owned business boyds that is desperately trying not to get knocked out by these mother fuckers, so desperate they bought a vw bug that they painted purple with boyds pharmacy on the side and some flowers, they make their employee's drive that shit around and deliver medication to folks) there goes big business making everyone look like clowns, whether it be the clothes they sell us or the categories they place us in so we can accesorize our characters with personalized fuzzy wheel covers or what the fuck ever. anyway....on with my point, which i will probably not get at. i was thinking why don't i do that, well nigga's gotta EAT. damnit. thats what this all comes down to. so while the rich, who will always win, i'll let them win, they can have the earth, cuz the shit doesn't do us any good, look at pompeii, earthquakes, lava, what ever else mother nature can cook up...she likes to destroy just like we do. if we had a chance, if we tore this all down and started singing songs on acoustic guitars cuz you can't plug that shit in, takes electricity, that involves the burning of fossil fuels, or technology, which is the form of progression. face it, NOTHING we have in the modern world can be substituted without destruction. EVERYTHING involves progression. we are human, we desire these things, it's not our fault we were given these hands that happened to be paired with insatiable urges. yeah it's a sad place....but animals we are. we'd do the same thing over. evolution although not perfect formed us, we keep growing up until it is our time to go. until we upset a balance, and then we are gone, and it's someone else's turn, its fuckin life. so i told my hippie alter ego to shut the fuck up, and i turned that shit off, and listened to metallica apetite for destruction...and everything made sense again. i didn't really i think i turned the station to some other stupid bullshit like some fuckin r and b artist using sexual metaphors that are completely disturbing. EW. EW. hahah white and uptight. if we go down, we go down in glory, confusion is our greatest trait, and even the sadest things in life can be beautiful. concrete jungle...it's still a jungle, still nature, nature can be ugly folks, it ain't all butterflies and big eyed deer running around. blood stained face of a lion, piles of rats, and water drowning whole countries feeding the sharks.  on top for too long? nah. our stay is short compared the lot of things."

"event","why is it that when i search for images of scenes from the movie about jeffrey dahmer i get pictures of nineties pop stars like alanis, hanson, even micheal bolton. hmmm. yeah i saw that movie, or parts of it, before i forced myself to sleep, which i then of course proceeded to have a sort of nightmare about it. MAN that movie was fuckin awesome, my subject was a line from it. i didn't know that dahmer could party, he was pretty cool besides the whole not wanting to have sex with a person that was alive thing, or a person that was of the opposite sex, it was always males. it was I BELIEVE because he hated being gay, and the only way he was gonna get some dick is if it was dead dick. 
i had a dream that i was smokin with him, which he does a lot of, yes jeffrey was a pot head...unbenounced to me too...i know...well...in my dream i was trying to talk him out of killing me, because i could see right through him, i told him that i am a very good judge of character, and i know when someone is a bullshitter a peice of shit ect...i think i ended up having the run from him anyway...my negotiating skills only get me so far, breaking up fights that jake is in...you know the usual. anyway...i seriously feel like i dunno...like i like jeffrey dahmer, i wanted to be his friend or something. he was a fuckin freak though...why i have this weird ass sympathetic view of him i have no idea, he's dead now so that doesn't matter. when i see that fucker in hell i'll help him play with body parts and shit. we'll stick our fingers in severed arms in the muscles and shit. i mean i was playing with a fetal pig and i had the urge to squeeze the eyeball until it popped and we cut open a sheeps brain which i also was stabbing with my tools. at first i wouldn't touch the shit, but once i had to...it was like i was a little kid with some hamburger, i bet thats how he felt...hmmm. i mean it is just a body. if i loose all hope in the world, since i'm majoring in biology i can just be a forensic scientist and play with some dead bodies..that would be super cool. i'm just kidding. but anyway...school is going sucky balls balls. i hate it. i dont hate my science classes it's all these extra dumb classes that i have to take, the ones that dont matter worth shit, and i have NO FUCKING CLUE why i have to take them. to make me a well rounded person??? it's just going to make me have a heart attack filling out these long ass questionares about myself and how i feel and what i want to do to act in my community. well i buy marijuana off of our local drug dealer and i often buy blunts from the fuckin sunoco down the street. is that enough for you ? 
<br>
i went to hooters tonight with anthony. isn't that sweet? haha. DAMN I DIDN""T REALIZE HOW SHORT THOSE SHORTS WERE. i dont know if you guys knew about my alternative to hooters...balls. its a resteraunt where you have to sit indian style on the ground, and you have male servers that wear short shorts where their nussacks hang out on each side of the short divider, and thats pretty much the whole idea. balls hang out shorts, you have to look up to address your server...so on. then we went to the comic book store. i want money!!!!!!! give me money!!! i saw some stuff, like this comic GOON. i enjoy monster drawings. stonerrock.com has an awesome jukebox you guys should check out...there is this band Dozer that is fuckin sweet. tommorow is beer time. and show time with my peoples. then meeting up with anthony at the mill hill. hooters, comics, DOOM, beer, live music, anthony, I'M GOING TO EXPLODE WITH HAPPINESS!!!!!!!!!

MC JOHN came over and we watched the woodstock dvd, fuckin AWESOME, i dont care what anyone says, and he was talking about how after that dvd was made most live music, or music documentaries were modeled after that. but it was all the people that made the documentary so fuckin good. it was just how they were, how they danced, what they did, what they said. it was all awesome. and i guess the camera man just caught them at the right time. SO MANY PEOPLE ON ACID. hahah it was fuckin funny. which is what my next topic is. i am eating massive amounts of shrooms over spring break. sounds like a freakin plan to me. i hope i end up in the woods like last time. accually no...i hope i end up...uhhhh shit i hope my mind takes me somewhere cool, i need a vacation. more like i need some motivation. other than school hatin, which is normal, and i can take it, i'm not a wuss...but yeah, i've been really happy, im always really happy, but i accually  have something to really look forward too now, that isn't a large blunt. yeah so i still haven't done shit with that clay, i can't wait till this week is over so i have time to bullshit with it. yes! woo. im excited to have some time off. 
<br>
and i have some of the best friends in the world. lauren reichert rules. we had about a half hour conversation about how jews suck. hahaha. she just made up this conversation between this jewish man that come in to her work and would get zany bars...as she put it ""i eat zany bars cuz im so stressed out from suckin corporate dick all day long"" ""lyric how was your day"" i guess it was a had to be there thing. we ate at a hippie resteraunt...damn hippie weekend. and she payed for all out broke asses. we fondued the shit out of saturday night...ohh yeah that goat cheese was bangin."

WHERE THE FUCK DO I FIT. glad, i didn't fit fuckin anywhere, im not a skinhead, im not a fuckin punk, im not a fuckin crusty, im not a fuckin squatter. im amanda FUCKIN stoner. this is so fuckin stupid, i thought that this was plain to see that you should accept anyone, that you should try and have fun with anyone. shit what the fuck else is there to do on earth. i guess everyone wants pathetic excuse for friendships like the way you dress or the music you listen to...well yeah those are intrests, but i also have made many different friends with people who dont think or dress the same way, yeah most of the time it got me no where, because NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO ACT IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE. like steph, yeah she was slutty, but she was fuckin awesome. she didn't care where i brought her, but of course she didn't know how to act, so i couldn't bring her around anymore. why doesn't everyone just shut the fuck up and enjoy themselves. this is why punk rock never went anywhere, that is why there is books written on sell outs or people looking back twenty years later, because everyone gets so caught up in the materialistic bullshit brought on my the consumer culture that is to be, lable this lable that, makes everything easier to hate, so we are all left abondoned by our pasts, abondoned by our friends that we HAD, what we thought to be strong connections made, but stds and our old clothes. because everyone is too busy tryin to stick their dicks in each other to realize, hey we could have something here we could have something so big, so big that it would FUCK THE WORLD, it would show the world what life is really about, its about rockin, and puttin your arms around your friends, no matter if they have arms or not. whatever...im mad so im just writtin shit that doesn't make sense. but listen to me, i love this shit, i love the music, i love everything. i've loved it since the first show i went to, when i saw bigwig, and fuck it i still like bigwig. haha. but im saying the environment is something that our puritan american past hasn't seen. we are something!!! rules and regulations and religion and buy this buy that buy this buy that...all that shit. stand in line, go in line, our WHOLE FUCKIN LIVES. so who wants to stand in my line...who the fuck wants to just let down your gaurd and fuckin have fuckin fun? because i know i do. i wanna smile, i dont want to feel like shit, and empty. who wants to feel that way? no one! so why would you want to make anyone else feel that way. closed minds. and i fall victim to it, everyday, but i've learned to deconstruct my thoughts, realize, hey fuck that, i could be friends with anyone. i sound like a god damn hippie, but you know what, there's another lable that keeps me from being myself. im true, and i promise thats all you'll ever get from me. here is a gay entree about gay shit, and im sure no one made it down here. but hey, i'll talk to anyone, drink a beer with anyone. i got a problem with some of the shit you do im sure, but hey, im here to fuckin have fun, and to make people smile. and that is it. thats all i'll ever want to do."

"event","My mom was cryin over somethin on the tv today because some lady adopted six little mexicans...my mom is really senstive, (i can be real sensitive too...im a wuss)....so i gave her a hug, and my dog came up to us and started lickin us and wanting attention...it was cute...it was like he wanted a hug too. it's just funny how dogs sense things like that. how when you yell and shit, no matter who it is...they will start barking...and wanting you to stop...and when everyone gets all close they come up and want some of the action...you know. it's an amazing thing the connections that animals make with each other. like the sea sponge and how you can take a cheese grater to it...and it will form back to its original shape and size...because it is a tightly knit group of cells that act as a colony sharin shit and takin the trash out together, gettin food together...its cool. gives me hope that my life isn't bullshit and all the people in it aren't bullshit. i was gonna write a love letter to rock and science in here...but this is better..because that is for a later time. i wrote those as my interests in under my highschool senior portrait where i look like my mom had sex with a fuckin lollipop kid or somethin weird and small and happy lookin. anyway....im at work...and i feel like i have terrets (spelling? who cares) today...like when customers call i feel like im gonna accidently say ""MOTHER FUCKER"" or ""HELL YEAH"" i just keep thinking in my head the wrong things to say...like i got an extra voice thats tellin me to say something else....oh no...could i be going insane...or is this just the effects of answering phones all day??? maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan. TIME TO GO HOME IN FORTY FIVE MINUTES YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo 

oh yeah funny thing, lauren was playin some leftover crack hahah behind me in the computer (there is two desks with computer in our little room) and our room has the door open at all times so we can deal with customers and shit...and some salesmen were walkin by and the part in the song thats like "" when i loose hope i shoot some smack i smoke some dope"" or whatever he says...crackhead...it was just funny, cuz what the fuck is that playin for in a business setting...oh man. funny stuff...well it was funny to me, guess it was a had to be there thing. this entree sucks....bleh."

"event","I""VE BEEN HAVING SOME FUCKED UP DREAMS. just when i thought my dreamin days were over, i get grandmom big foot, fiddy cent, and cops in my dream. alright it starts off with me being drunk in a store, and its really late at night, and jesse's grandmom is in the store with me, i believe we broke in...and she starts throwin shit around and breakin shit, and saying some jewish shit...and i mlike ""whats wrong"" and she's having a flashback from back in the day...so i run out of the store but im all stumblin and i fall on the ground in front of a cop...and i act like im just a drunk person stumblin from a bar, not from a crime scene....i go around back and i see fiddy cent...or what i thought was...and the cop starts botherin him and he's just on the corner tryin to sell drugs and the cop arrests him and his friends...and not me or jesse's grandmom...MAN that was a fucked up dream. but the night before i had a dream that my friend dave from school was addicted to ""smoking dope and shooting smack"" as he said...man that was fucked up. i have a really bad headache today too...i wonder if thats why im having such vivid dreams. i remember every second of them. or maybe i accually care about jesse's friend john. he's been having problems, and i think im really worried about it, and you know i dont know him all too well..but i just can't stand watching someone do that...it sucks. arrrrgggghhhh damn my fuckin feelings. hahaha but man being drunk in a dream is so weird, its like that sticky feet thing you get when you can't move...that what it was like. and i think that the cops in my dream arrested fiddy cent becuase i had to do some paper on cultural differnce in the classroom...and it was about racial inequality, and when the cops were arresting them, i was trying to say that i did it but i was too drunk to get the words out... man that was fuckin weird. YEAH IM DONE MY PAPER WOO HOO. i think it turned out alright too...maybe i dunno. i always end up bullshittin half of it, im so fuckin stupid, i hate that, i think if i applied myself i could be somethin..but naaaaah im comfortable at the bottom. plus i say ""fuck it"" new dave chappelle episodes are accually funny...i didn't think they were gonna be. but hey im entertained."

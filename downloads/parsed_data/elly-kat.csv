"event","ok so where to start....last nights outting...
Lize, helz, mitsey and i all went to the bar with no name, to get pissed on that real yummy housewine....we sat in the trendy joint with really dim lights and chatted about everything....the more we drank the more we talked...
Before we knew it, it was like 1 in the morning and we had to get to weekender when there were no more trams running...so mitsey caught a taxi home...while i pretty much dragged lizes and helzies drunken asses down the road to weekender...we thought we'd hike it...i was peed off that i wasnt pissed as well cuz we all drank pretty much the same xept lize sculled her last bit which made her vom in the loo before we left....but i encouraged her to get it all out and she was sweet to go...
We stopped off at 7 eleven where some indian curry muncher told helen she's too tall...lize being drunk as a skunk, grabbed him by the coller with both hands and said ""dont you say  that about my friend she's beautiful."" everyone was staring cuz they thought she was gonna belt him, but she wouldnt hurt a fly...curry muncher ended up comin onto lize and i quickly dragged her outta there before anything grose happened...
finally got to weekender....and i cheered up cuz they were playing heaps of kickass songs in a row...so we danced, but i was about to die from the heat and was really wishing i had worn a singlet...next time....
not much hottie guys there that i was wishing were there...i guess i thought they would all be different kinda guys that im into rather than the shit you get in pubs and other clubs....
There was one hottie but some blonde bitch started talking to him so that was all over...lol....
Lize still pissed, started poking some guy she was keen on....i guess thats her pick up attempt...she did this even though it seemed he was with some other girl who looked like a dogs hairy rotten maggot filled ass....to cut a long story short, she got with him......
I ended up having a chat with some guy and he told me bout his band and to come see em play in april....helz have you asked reza if he might know em???
We left round 3:30 or sumfin...then watched some big fight between these wog guys while we waited for our night rider....
We met some guys who came up to us...one was a pom with a nice accent, who i ended up kissing....one of em was trying to get my number then i quickly said nah i lost my phone...which was such an obvious lie...
night rider came and we sat in the back where i lay down closing my eyes...some whole group of idiot guys were saying shit bout helz that shes a witch and how she is gonna put a spell on em, probably cuz shes goth, or looks goth..they wouldnt shut up about it...then they were saying something bout me sleeping and to wake me up so i opened my eyes...bla bla bla...we all crashed at lizes...got to bed by 5:30
Managed to get a good 2 hours sleep...in the morning lize crawls into bed with me, eats her bit of watermelon and shoves the rest on my forehead leaving it all to drip down my face...why did you do that????
So today even though we are buggered as shit...lize, jonno, neis and i went to st kilda festival...was really awesome as usual but couldnt enjoy it cuz we were too tired to walk around...i bought a black and brown semi leathery bracelet, and splurged out and got me a framed black and white picture of our kickass city...well of blurry kinda effect of a tram....thats in our city...cost me $40 now im pretty much broke...
thats fucked cuz im so gonna get my tattoo this week...helz you comin?
i havent even had a shower so i reak of disgusting ciggies and what not, and im all sweaty from todays heat....look i just reak ok...
thats it...
xept that we saw heaps of celebs today...."

Last night lize and i did some late night shopping even though we didnt actually end up buying anything....but we are goin back today cuz we need some retail therapy for our crap lives...

We ended up goin for a long ass walk that went for at least 2 hours...started light raining but it felt nice on our hot faces...
when we got back we rubbed deep heat on our legs cuz we were already sore from the day before...

So tonight is the night where we finally go out till dawn like the old days...we just havent done it for a while cuz...i dunno why...but i hope its eventful...eventful in a good way...

im finding it really hard to type with this band aid on my finger..

i hate the wankers on the sparta messege board...they act like their it and then some....and some bitch on there...miss high and mighty...the name sez it all...she thinks she owns the entire site...bloody stupid slut dog.....
i hate more than anything in this world....people who look down on you, cuz u may not have a fantastic life like theirs...come on everyone deserves to be treated like every other tom dick and harry...cuz we are all the same, only our lives turn out different cuz we have been born with different circumstances....
See this is the reason why my posts are always long...cuz i think way too much and like to share some of these thoughts which end up leading to something else.....ok i am stopping now...

"event","The funniest shit happens in buses...today some old granny parked her car in the bus stop area to pick up a really frail granny who could barely walk...but the bus decides to rock up right then and nearly crashed in the back of her...there was a massive argument between the granny who was pickin up the frail one, against the bus driver man and another old granny in the bus....these respectful looking grandmothers were at each other throats even slipping in the word bitch! the bus driver was goin nuts as i stood trying to stick my ticket in the machine between him and the granny having a massive screaming match....was pretty full on and i had to sit there with a straight face trying not to laugh my ass off... 
Went to the bloody job agency and had to call up some retail job...i think its for myer...had to sit there and have a job interview over the phone, which i spun shit outta my mouth and aced...made it through the next level which means ive gotta go do some applitude test...ahhhh well obviously thats as far as id be goin cuz theres no way in hell id be able to answer any of the mathematical questions...i find the thought of me having to sit there totally lost highly amusing....

just remembered a really fucked thing that happened to me this morning...also in a bus...the bus arrives i get my ticket and sit down....i look outside the window on the other side of the road, and the bus driver goin the other way was full on staring! for a second i thought hey that looks like reza..but obviously wasnt... i thought yeah his lookin at my bus driver, but my bus driver was talking to someone and facing the other way...i looked up again and he was staring right at me and smiling his ass off...like he was trying to say something to me...i think he whistled...i quickly looked down...when the lights turned green i looked at him and he was still staring...what the fuck?
was all very weird....ok you had to be there alright...

On a more awesome note.....neis has gotten a job!!! a kickass one...yesterday she applied for a massage job for some really posh well known hotel in the city....and she bloody well got it and starts like tomorrow....thats so fuckin awesome and im really happy for her...she has worked her ass off in college ever since she left school..has studied for 3 years and has like half a year left...and at age 20 she gets a top job people would have to search and apply for years to get....when she called me and informed me of the good news i let out some massive excited scream that echoed through not only my house but the entire street, cuz my neighbours came out, and the old bag next door was staring...and also neisa's mum heard me from the other line and said, yes thats how i reacted..lol...how embarrassing...nah i dont care...well done again neis...
Im so glad this weeks nearly over...im tired as all fuck from a week full of looking, applying, and going to interviews for jobs....fuuuuuuck great the fuckin owner is here!!!!!!!!1 omg!!! im fuckin annoyed!!!!!!!!!FUUUUUUUUCK OFFFFFFFF!!! HE HASNT CALLED ME YET...AHHHHH....he is here to fix the door which his made worse....for some unknown reason he thinks my names maria, and that georges name is joe...
Anywho........im gonna go treat myself to some retail therapy and go buy me some clothes...ive got my eye on this singlet in broadway...
oh yeah i dont think ill be goin to greece cuz george doesnt wanna be responsible for the cafe, cuz my dads puttin all the shit on him...and mums not impressed....i guess thats why their divorced..lol...im doin alot of lols today arnt i? 

So yeah this saturday should be very fun...plan is...going to St kilda festival during the day...but this is gonna suck cuz dan brodie is playing last that means we really wont be able to go home and change for later...but anyway then we are meant to be going to brunswick street to the bar with no name to get pissed on that kickass bottle of housewine which absolutely makes you embarress yourself...we then were goin to move onto maybe brideys where we might possibly get stuck into the pints....then bugger off to weekender in the city where hopefully our type of guys hang out....this of course probably wont happen..and we wanna take neis to celebrate her gettin that job...but she doesnt like goin out gettin pissed and comin home with the sun rising up...who knows by then anyway.....................oooo neis is gonna give me a massage tonight and probably lize cuz she needs to practice....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....actually ahhhhhhhhhhhhh her massages hurt, but thats cuz she needs to get all that tension out.....

"event","FUCK THAT!! was so fuckin excited about gettin home to listen to The Mars Volta EP which i finally fuckin found hiding away in the best music store in Australia, Missing Link...only to realise that my fave song which i could have a orgasm over isnt even on the fuckin EP....and to tell you the honest fuckin truth im not that into the 3 songs which are on it after it cost me $14 ....half the CD is taken up with pointless sounds and noises...which i guess cedric was really into even back in the at the drive-in days,...im just fuckin pissed off that my fave song isnt on it i guess..fuck that...
And im also pissed off that i have no life and have to fuckin do what other tell me to do cuz im stuck in this situation of needing a job, and need to go to fuckin stupid job interviews in fucked up shops where they sell ugly, tacky, fucked up granny flap looking uniforms for nurses and what not....the sheila is meant to be calling me back on Friday to let me know if ive made it to the second interviews or if ive gotten the boot....FUCKIN GIVE ME THE BOOT!!!! fuck that...im not travelling to the city every motherfuckin day by train then tram, to be there by 9 or 8:30 for a fucked up job im probably gonna end up murdering someone in...and who the fuck was that fuckin dork guy who was talking to me? looked like he was gonna slober down my top....
Walking around the entire fuckin day in 30 sumfin degree heat in hard ass berkie clogs which bruised my feet they were so hard and gave me blisters, dressed in a fuckin skirt and a nice girly semi frilled top lookin like some kinda fuckin prissy bitch slut hore sheila, not being able to find the fuckin job agency and have to practically run on sore feet to get there on the time my appointments for, and having to fuckin walk into a kick ass punk music store where id fuckin kill to work in, dressed like a dork while buying mars volta and a sparta badge having the guy wonder why the fuck someone dressed like a fuckin cunt licker would have that sorta taste...having to take out my labret ring only to have a layer of skin heal over and practically shove it through again when i finally get home, all cuz i have to conform with the 2003 society of piercings = drug addict low lives who arnt smart enough to have a job and therefor have to take it out to prove a point to some wankers which under different circumstances where i didnt have to do what people said in order to get payments to survive in this fucked up world where money=survival, id normally tell to fucking bugger off...and then to have ur friend look at you like ur a fuckin dickhead and have every thing u say accompanied with the roll of the eyes and a bored expression...isnt my idea of a good fuckin time....YES IM FUCKIN COMPLAINING AGAIN!!!SO THE FUCK WHAT!!!! ANYONE WHO HAS A PROBLEM WITH THAT CAN COME RIGHT ON OVER AND KISS MY CREAMY BEHIND!!!

*fuck* word count: lost count

So now im sittin here in my underwear hoping that my brother doesnt come home before i get to post this shit...or that he doesnt come in here and bring along his mate who would see me in my underwear....

oh another bloody annoying thing!!! Spartas Ep has been deleted..so i wont find it in OZ!!!

Anyway its pretty much been another fucked up day....tomorrow ive got more shit to look forward to seeing as i have to go to the job agency AGAIN!!! for some fucked up job club shit....fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkk!
i have a foul mouth for a female and have realised this is a turn off for guys...just like when girls fart....yesterday the guy who owns this house asked what i would do if i ever got a boyfriend and he didnt like my tattoo.....i said, well he can go away...that was the nice way of putting what i really was thinking which was more along the lines of ....he can bugger off into the toilet to pull his pathetic excuse for a cock cuz thats the only enjoyment he'd be gettin.....of course i couldnt say that to the owner seeing as his an old italian man with old fashioned family values...plus he probably wouldnt understand all that english..."

on the way home we noticed the sun was a fuckin bright red colour and massive, but by the time i got home to take a pic of it, it had pissed off...so lize and i went to the half pipe....there were 3 dickhead boys there throwing rocks all over it and werent pissing off, so we went back to my joint for a sec to get some socks...when we came back the little shits were walking off, and said something bad to us as we drove passed...lize slammed on the breaks and revearsed which made the little turds shit their pants and they ran for their lives, as we shouted out harsh words, like...
ELIZA: Fuck off ya little cunts
ELLY: Yeah run home to ur mummys so they can wipe ur asses for uze.

it started gettin dark so half of em didnt turn out..
After that i came home to find my brother standing out the front with his mates, dave and con...last time i saw con was at my brothers party where he got pissed, confessed his love for me, later fell down wacked his head on concrete, had a massive ass lump the size of a fair sized golf ball on his head, and went to the hospital to get it checked out.....but his a real nice guy.....not nice in the way of smooch smooch, root root though...
I talked to em for a bit...con mostly about the big day out and tonights simpson episode which was totally trippy....then they went out after they asked me to come with em...i looked at george he didnt seem to mind but declined anyway..lol...
ooo my dad called back again today but i was out...said that he wants to make sure me and my brother will come work for him in greece in summer before he gets the loan...this is scary...its gettin near the stage where id be lifting off in a plane and going off to a complete other country with complete different people, religions, values, and everything...away from my friends, mum, pets..AUSTRALIA THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD!!! itll only be for 3 months...i wanna fuckin visit every country on this earth..i wanna know what people on the other side of the world wake up to every day....it fuckin amazes me....still it might not even happen..."

lize and i werent pissed just being our normal dickhead selves..we had about 6 beers each and that was it...jason got piddled a bit i think..so this is how the rest of the night went...
We danced around to phil collins in our 80's dancing style...then pretended we were at a club seeing as we didnt actually go out to one...
Lize and i dressed up like homies, nelly style, and put on some basketball singlets, bandanas on our heads (colours dawg colours), hoodies, and bandaids on our faces..then moved around like a bunch of homies from the ghetto to cypress hills 'rock superstar'..jason had a sook cuz he still wishes he was black and thought we were takin the piss outta black rappers...pffft...
Then the lamers me and lize, downloaded 'what i go to school for' by busted, some wanky little try hard punk/rock/pop NSYNC loving boys...and acted like cockheads trying to work out the lyrics and sing along to it like fuck head little girls..but we mostly made up our own lyrics about one of our old teachers miss boyce, who looks like pork on legs..kinda went somethin like ""thats what i go to school for, to see miss boycies fanny which tastes like off salamie."" i dunno we were fucked...
theeeeeen i dunno...i cracked it at jason for grabbing my tit without my permission!!!i was seriously about to crush his nuts... was more talking, then bed...where jason was a fuckwit who wouldnt piss off to bed cuz he had to sleep by himself and he wanted to sleep in between me and lize, only to have us tell him to fuck off, and then we totally ignored him...till he went away...seeing as his such a pussy little girl, he had to sleep with the lamp on next to the bed...i cant sleep with the smallest bit of light in the room, and this light was shining right out the door and into the room i was sleepin in...so...i lay there not being able to sleep till about 6 sumfin when the weiner finally grew some balls and switched it off...
i know im being harsh to jase but....he is a little panzy...
today lize and jase went to maccas to get some breakfast...i couldnt be fucked gettin outta bed so they got me sumfin(by the way who do i owe for that?) we ...or should i say me and lize cleaned up the house then jason went home...annnnnnnnnnnd....we went to JB then HMV where we got the streets album cuz no fuckin aussie music stores have spartas EP!! or the mars volta!!....we then went blading on the half pipe down the road from my joint with kristy who i havent seen for a while...caught up..which was pretty kool and should do more of cuz i miss the little shit, and now im home..alone..just the way i like it...."

This morning i woke up in a foul mood and took it out on my mum as per usual...i feel bad while im acting like the biggest bitch to her but i just cant help myself..its like i want to stop but i cant...mitsey came round and showed me the pictures of her view from the hot air balloon ride she went on early this morning...
Now im fuckin bored.........

mums annoying friends are over and talking real loud as per usual...i warned mum before hand not to come in and bother me to say hi to em...she said i should at least come out to say a quik hi or id appear rude...i just said i dont give a shit how i appear, their not here to see me, plus i am rude so they would be gettin to know me....of course she gave up..
im really restless again so i guess that means my nails will be filed right down to the core..ill grow em next time i swear..

bla bla bla he asked why i wasnt goin out...then they went out...mum told me that she heard dave ask for me...and then she made THE face...u know the face where its saying ""oooo someone fancies my daughter"" ahhhhhh i dont think so..his all...i dunno..manly...has a job, has a cool car, has friends, has a life, had a pretty girlfriend...so what would he see in me who, has no job, has no car, ok i have friends, has no life, and dont want a boyfriend...plus his never seen me out of my pj's or flannelette jacket.. of course when he left i checked out my face..and there u have it!!!! sauce on my cheek, grimey oily hair that needs a wash quick smart...blahh im rooted in the head..

So margo sez...oh theres some jobs goin at rebel sport, ill get JOE to speak to u about it...i froze...cuz remembering when i had to do work for the dole at epping, and he used to constantly stare his ass off at me and my friend suzie...like really look us up and down, perving on our ass and all....and we used to give him the evil eye... so she bloody calls him in...i had gone red before he even came in the room...his like hey, i know u from somewhere dont i....im like..errr yeah ummm probably epping...and he smiled and went on to describe the job.....so fuckin great he works in there now..theres no escaping unless i find me a job...ive gotta go into rebel on monday and hand in my resume to the manager...i hope his a pervert so i can get the job..lol..how bad did that sound...
Anyways...ive gotta boot off and get ready to go play some soccer with the girls at the park, lize will be here any sec to pick me up...plus theres a massive bog that needs to be released....shit, i dunno how im gonna kick the ball cuz thats what set my ankle off in the first place...and its still pretty buggered...should look for some bandage to wrap the bastard in...

This ive given a bit of thought to today...mostly cuz, i myself let a few rip...this to me is a fun, and relaxing daily activity, one which im not willing to stop if ever courted...

Tonight i had an interesting conversation with jason...it went sort of as follows:
JASON: Do you get extra juicey?
ELLY: Huh what do ya mean?
JASON: You know like down there in your tic tacs
ELLY: Ya mean my crack?
ELLY: Yeah well its human nature to get all wet when horny.
JASON: HAHA HE HE HAHA HAHA HEHA HAHA
ELLY: The cock needs help getting in from the wetness.
JASON: So u get all like really wet and juicey.
ELLY: Who wouldnt
JASON: HA HA your one of them really wet ones.
JASON: Your extra juicey. I bet you leave like one of them snail trails behind.
ELLY: Thats fuckin off 

Thats the censored version...
Meanwhile i cant stop thinking....i mean thinking about every little thing...about every tom, dick and harry, about what im looking for in a guy...so i made this list...of the WANTS and  WANT-NOTS that id want if i was EVER to settle down....theres like a few sections....physical appearance...and personality...then theres the things i dont want in a guy....of course i realise if i were to post this in here it would make me look like a total picky, choosey, bitch...but i do understand that me of all people cant afford to be picky...but i dont give a shit cuz i never said a guy like that actually lives in this world...and if he did im not saying that he would be searching for someone to be with like the likes of me.....so i best not post my 'IDEAL GUY' in ere...
All i will say is...he comes pretty close to lookin and being someone like Jim from Sparta...

Im still feeling weird yet really worked up....
Mum and her friend have made up...she came over again with her son...its not that he isnt nice...just asks way too much questions, cuz i guess his still young.....when ur in a 'i cant be fucked' mood its really annoying....He was askin shit like..
BILL: whats it like in high school? 
ELLY: shit
BILL: Are the teachers nice?
ELLY: There a bunch of morons
BILL: Do you get to cut up animals in biology?
ELLY: Yeah but you have to eat at least their brain or heart after.
BILL: Can i play with your hockey stick?
ELLY: No
BILL: ohhhhh come on pleaasseee.
ELLY: Get out of my room
BILL: Why?
ELLY: Cuz...im......doing stuff..im busy
(manage to get him out, and hold the door shut with my foot as he tries pushing it open.)
BILL: Are you standing behind the door
ELLY: No ...its locked

"event","Last night i was ready to kill someone....
i was in that much of a foul mood, that even i think i hid it well considering...actually i think everyone knew i wasnt impressed but they could never have known how much i was fumeing inside...
I dont even know half the reason why i was..maybe it was cuz i was hot and bothered and couldnt go home to change, maybe its cuz i had not eaten all day, except for quikly shoving this tuna, cheese and cream stuff in my gob after it had been left out all night and i still ate it cuz it looked good, only to be dry reaching in the dunny and feeling sick the rest of the day...maybe its cuz i bought a whole film which i didnt get to use...maybe cuz little fuckheads shit me....maybe cuz the last episode of x files sucked...maybe cuz i wasnt comfortable...maybe cuz of many more reasons i best not go into in this journal unless i want a massive argument to errupt... 
yesterday lize, helz and me went to the city and parked the car in front of the hotel, to see if we could try our luck on gettin any photos with some bands...there was a group of fuckwit kids dressed up like little try hard goths, who were probably waiting for the murderdolls and deftones..who they did get to meet..they were running around like cockheads and falling off the skateboard and crashing into the wall to be funny...which was pretty pathetic...but would of been funny if they had really injured themselves...
Lize and helz saw paul walk out of the hotel, and since i dont like sittin in the one spot for more than 5 seconds, had enough of the sittin on my arse in a car in 40 degree heat, and had went for a walk in my beaut city to check out the sites and weird people...and hope i bump into sparta...neis joined us later, and we went back to lizes house to watch the last ever ep of x files...which i thought was ok...just ok...if even that...

Last night i had a dream that i caught a plane to el paso...when i arrived there were 3 signs pointing in different directions...one said Roswell the other Anthony....dont remember the other but i think it started with C....i dunno which one i chose but then i was walking down these streets and people were lookin at me weird...the air was really warm and dusty and some guy grabbed my arm and dragged me into this club called area sumfin...now i was scared but people were smiling at me and said welcome...then i was drinkin beer, while heaps of people were talkin to me...i got dizzy and was then outside where it was now dark, and the moon was massive, red and purple and i was laying in sand...thats all i remember...dunno what made me dream that but when i woke up it was like 12 and i never sleep in that late...today i feel all weird like im meant to be there right now...those who know me are probably thinking yeah cuz thats where spartas from but i dunno i feel all weird....maybe i have like a lost relative there....fuck let it be true..lol"

Im in freaken heaven right now..and its all thanx to Tony!!!
what a fuckin kool guy!!!!!!!
Rocked up at the corner hotel, and as soon as i stood there tony walks right passed me..i shit my pants froze and couldnt even manage a hi....so i stood there waitin for reza and paul walks passed and again i was caught off gaurd...went in bought me a sparta top, then we went and had a beer before we headed to the stage...we got a pretty good spot second row from the front where i could see all the guys...they came out, shook my head around like a nut, sung along...watched tony go sick on the drums, and jim draw me in with his moves.....unfortunately it had to finish some time and they left...stuff like pics and set lists were thrown out to people, none of which i got despite reza's attempts...so i got shitty that i was leavin without sumfin material to take home with me that was from them...this guy next to me got 2 pics and i was about to throw him on the ground and stomp him for em...so we headed outside to the side door cuz reza had the cover of their album to get signed..i was pissy cuz i didnt have not even a piece of paper...these women were hangin outside and as they walked back in reza asked them if they could take that in for him to get signed...they said sure but never came back out...CUZ TONY CAME OUT WITH THE PAPER INSTEAD!!!!!!!WHAT A FUCKIN LEGEND, HE DIDNT HAVE TO BUT HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO COME OUT AND MEET THE FANS!!
Then he fuckin shook our hands and introduced himself, had a little chat, and cuz i didnt have anything signed he went back in then out and gave us both his pics then went back in, and got me a set list that they have scribbled on signed by all of em!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bloody hell he is such a sweety i cant get over it...after that i couldnt shut up and we met lize and neis in the city where they were staking out the rest of the bands in front of the hotel...reza having no shame whatsoever walked in the poshy hotel like he owned it to get a drink from the bar.... sparta rocked up later and were all sittin on the couches at the bar.....like an hour went by with reza gone, us wondering who the fuck his managed to talk to in there...i was so set and about to go in, but then he came out..turned out he sat down and had a chat with the deftones and they put him and helen on the door list where they are playing tomorrow night...and he talked to jim and matt!! fuck!! i felt a bit bad going in and talkin to em cuz id seem like a total desperate fuck stalkin em and not lettin the poor guys have a rest...
tomorro we r goin into the city to see if we can track down millencolin...well and other bands...
ive got such a fuckin killer headache......
but yeah fuck sparta rocked! and tony i fuckin luv u cuz ur not a snobby fuck like some other band members who think their it...

oh nearly forgot..some dickturds ran in the hotel as soon as they saw sparta...then one of the girls stumbled out 2 minutes later, and chucked up behind the tarago...she stood there hunched over chuckin for a while then walked back in the hotel where she sat back on a couch...she got kicked out later by some poshy woman...then she stumbled into these plants and managed to wave her arms in the air before she nearly got run over by a taxi...then zoomed away in it..."

"event","The bastards have turned off our water to fix sumfin in our street...so theres no water for a shower, to drink or to flush my shit down the dunny...but thats ok it comes back on at 2...i think...
Last night was pretty funny, cuz my mums friend came over and they had a big argument...so there i was in the lounge room trying to watch at the drive-in on rage, and every time the guys would be on and talkin, mum and her friends voice would multiply by a thousand and i couldnt hear shit...so id try turning the volume up secretly so it wouldnt seem rude that i was trying to shut their voices out....but no volume capacity could be overheard when competeing with 2 mothers having an argument...finally i evacuated to my room, otherwise i would of told them both to shut up...lucky cuz about 2 minutes after i did, they were really having a screaming match and my mums friend walked out, dragging her son along with her....mum was majorly pissed after that...

Tonight...the night i see sparta..been hangin out...called lize when she was in the middle of watchin sparta at the big day out and could hear em playing, Red Alibi, my fave song...so that got me all hyped up...last night though i was pretty annoyed cuz mum found out i was goin alone and had a massive sook about how guys are gonna see me on my own and approach me..then they will follow me outside...and how im gonna get raped when catchin the train home alone at like 12 at night..ok that last one could happen especially in richmond...but come on im a 20 year old WOMAN who can look after herself...if all else fails aim for the nuts....

"event","k so this is gonna be another long post to fill uze in on all thats happened on the weekend...
Friday, lize, neis and i went to Edinburgh Gardens in North Fitzroy, to kick the soccer ball around...but we didnt do much kickin as it was very very warm...so we did more talking...dropped neis off home, then lize and i were off to the beach...got there pretty late like around 1...and went to bed cuz we were hot and buggered..
Next day was awesome cuz it was steamin hot..port was packed full of people...heaps of maltese cuz they usually have the maltese festival around that time but cancelled it cuz some wankers liked to do burn outs, drag, and a little kid got hit and killed last year or sumfin..so there was heaps of security blockin off everything....mitsey drove down for the day and we swam all day till we nearly drowned in the water from being so tired...there was some little wave action, just enough to have me worried that my bikini top would fly off...but it didnt...had a good ole BBQ then mitsey went home...
That night was nice and warm, so lize and i went for a walk to the pier...there were heaps of people out and about...we watched some local guys jump off the pier, trying to do big arse bombs...then we sat down and had a convo bout how we never pick up at the beach any more and wondered why...later that night we were to find out...
We went for a walk to the town and on our way back to the caravan, the blokes jumpin off the pier pulled up next to us in their car...they gave us a beer we had a chat, and agreed to meet up with em once they went home to get sumfin and we went back to the van for a tick...there were 4 guys...when they came back there were 2, so i guess u know what happened next...lize and i realised we have matured alot and thats why we dont pick up at the beach anymore...when we were young it used to be all...""do u like my friend, he wants to kiss you"" now we just wanna have a convo and if anything happens it happens...but this was sooo planned on the guys behalf...once one of em went to take a piss his mate said, do any of u like him.....i said yeah his ok, cuz i didnt want the other one....so the one that asked was all over lize...seeing as i wasnt doin anything with him mate, which obviously wasnt a fast mover as the other...the guy went for a 'walk' with lize...bla bla bla...we ended up talkin which was good...then i guess he couldnt control his throbbing penis anymore and he kissed me...i was never planning on goin any further than that...lize and her guy came back before the poor bastard got to feel any tit under my shirt...we said our goodbyes...my one wanted to come back after they dropped their car off probably cuz i got his cock in motion, now he would have to finish it off himself..hahaha...u guys are funny....wont say what lize got up to, cuz thats up to her...
After walkin all the way back to the caravan park, lize realised she left her belt behind...so we walked all the way back, meanwhile not being able to walk for a second without having maltese guys surround us....we dont normally talk to muzzas(muzzas are guys who are of wog origin who talk like apes, cruise around in their done up cars with techno blasting out the speakers) but these ones seemed nice...we found her belt had a long chat with em as we walked back...went to bed....
Next day lize was in a shitty mood cuz we didnt get enough sleep...yet i was the one who had to be goin out for mitseys birthday that night...we went for a swim and tried doin handstands in the water, but i just swallowed a heap of water through my nose...made the trip back home...said bye to lize and got ready to go out...wasnt lookin forward to it at all...cuz the crown where all the 'doof doof' slutty sleazy clubs are, isnt my kinda scene...went to mitseys had a couple of drinks....went to jacks bar which sucked massive rabbit balls...sleazy guys lookin ya up and down...we sat down..i met mitseys friend she always talks about..shes i think 28 and i found her attractive for some reason...she was talkin to me heaps and was like she was flirting with me always touching my leg and talking to me so close we were practiacally kissing...there was no dancing there but mitsey stood up and shook her ass, and rubbed her crack on the couch sexually...people were lookin like 'what the fuck' and some really old ugly bloke was staring from the bar..eewwwwwkkk....suddenly these 2 guys came over and were telling us that the old bloke was perving...one was older the other looked like a fuckin younger version of jim from sparta...i was in la la land as it was the closest id ever get to this gorgeous man...his name was ben but i still called him jim...told him id be seeing him on tuesday performing at the corner hotel..unfortunately he has a girlfriend...of course...we were talkin bout kissin styles and he described his kissin technique just the way i like it...he said he would like to show me how his kissing style is and would if he didnt have a girlfriend...at this point i was drooling inside...cuz he also had a really good personality...we left cuz mitsey had to be home and she was gettin stomach cramps....said bye and he kissed my hand, then he kissed me real gently on the cheek...mmmm mmmmmm....but that was all... i didnt go home without at least one kiss that night...on the walk back to the car, nicki(the attractive 27 year old) had her arms around me...she has a boyfriend but i still asked if she is interested in girls cuz she gave out that impression...mitsey told me that she had a thing with a girl once...nickie was all over me, she said that ""I wish i didnt have a boyfriend cuz im very much wanting u right now"" and she was kissing my face and neck as we walked passed a group of guys who stood there staring with their mouths open, while making orgasm noises they obviously couldnt hold back...meanwhile mitsey and her cousin were walkin further behind....in the car i sat in the back with her and she was holding my hand...when we dropped her off she looked at me and said it was soooo good meeting u ill get mitsey to give me ur number...and she bloody well leant over and kissed me on the lips...then i felt a bit of tounge slip in...but hey i went with it...it was only for a second...mind u im straight...i like my boys too much..but ...dunno...there was sumfin bout her which made me want her..hahahaha man im fucked...im not a lesbian...theres nothin wrong with being one...wouldnt mind if i was...but i like guys too much...bit of experimentation wouldnt hurt...
So thats basically it...the shortened version of events...
today lize and helz have gone to the big day out...and im here...again...like some dickhead...couldnt afford the ticket $95 or sumfin...not worth it if u cant push ur way through the massive crowds...and see shit all... hope lize calls me during a millencolin song...doubt she will...WOOOO tomorra im goin to see sparta!!!!!! gettin excited now...even though id probably be goin by myself...but im lookin forward to spendin some alone time out with elly..rez still might come if he can buy a ticket at the door...either way dont mind...and i actaully get to see the REAL jim...toot toooooot...
my freakin ankle still hurts like hell...a while back jason picked me up and dropped me...my ankle gave way and i slid on my arse...the same day i ran after the basketball and my ankle gave way again...when kickin the soccer ball it started gettin sore all over again..the swimming didnt help it, and the boots i had on last night didnt help it...now i cant bend it without it hurting and shaking....i dont care if it gets worse im gonna still go see sparta and hop on one foot...."

"event","You know theres these mornings when as soon as u wake up, u just know its gonna be one of those days where everything goes wrong...well today is one of those days....
FIRST THINGS FIRST:
i get woken up by the alarm clock dromeing in my ears, the most piercing irritation known to man and womankind....to turn it off i need to get outta bed...so i have 10 minutes to get ready and out of the house...the night before i allocated 5 minutes to shave legs, 5 to get dressed.....but mum left a note informing me that i need to make the pasta salad before i leave so george has lunch to take to work! i panic and quickly throw chicken in oven..it needs 18 minutes but 10 will have to do...but no...massive smoke piles starts spilling out of the oven as if on fire...so ive gotta stick all the chicken back into its box and freezer while waving a rag under the smoke alarm....
TOILET/TAKING PISS:
Of course no toilet paper left in dunny, so i run out with pants down hoping brother doesnt walk out, and grab some only to have the wrapping not wanting to fuckin tear off.
PASTA SALAD PREPARATION:
i think bugger the chicken george can fix the oven when he gets up...the pasta was already made so i had to peel then grate carrots, where i grated my finger over already sore scar...ignored it as i cut up avacado...but...it wasnt ripe, too late i had already pealed it...it was that solid it nearly broke the knife, i kid u not....chopped up salary, which fell all over the floor and there was none left..so i gave it a quick rinse...then i couldnt find the bowl we usually put the salad in...so i whacked it in some other thing which was too small but i had no time to i squashed it in....carrot also all over the floor dried up and hard to get off...meanwhile having ginger meowing constantly up at me...
GETTING DRESSED: 
Still have blisters on feet from sandals, and no thongs to wear on a 37degree day...searched around for anything that would allow me to breath but had to settle for reefs which are too big for my feet and i looked like a duck....skirt was wrinkled to the shit so had to wear other one which rides up my ass....wacked ona singlet realised theres stains all over it, but left it on....
LAST MINUTE FUCK UP:
bout to run out the door when i saw on note...close all windows and i havent fed cedric...so i ran outside grabbed food and water, ran back in ran back out, ran back in, then out again to feed cedric...as i was walking down the street my undies begun riding up my ass, they WERE a good pair but for some reason they must of just fucked up overnight!!!so i kept walking feeling as if my undies were gonna fall down around my ankles...as i ran across the busy road nearly getting hit by a ford and my grinspoon badge falls off my bag, so i watch it as it gets crushed by the passing cars..
BUS STOP:
waiting for the fuckin bus always a freakin treat..of course the bus was late..sat there between a smelly lady and an old B.O ridden man....tried holding my breath, but couldnt long enough....the fuckin flies were incredible...it started with that ONE CUNT of a fly which buzzed around my face and wouldnt fuck off...then a sworm of em came landing on every bit of my body...it was happening to the others too but not as bad as me...then later one fucker flew up my skirt and perched its germy ass on my inner thigh...i wriggled and squirmed as much as i could without making it look like i have a itchy crack that needs to be scratched...finally i had to open my legs quick and shut em again...this i did only to have some fat disgusting slob bloke see from where he was sittin in his car....then a wasp was buzzing around my legs about to land...i sat there holding my breath, wearing a bright green top while the others had on dull colours..i wonder which one it would of wanted to land on...thank god it didnt....
FINALLY THE BUS:
it arrives late...the bus driver drops my change as it spills on the floor...i had to bend over and pick it up with short skirt on revealing my ass to the entire bus...
JOB AGENCY: 
Arrive late, wait for margo for at least 10 minutes...no jobs of course..she informs me that centrelink are making us do an extra activity...so we made mine to be lookin for a course...got all excited when we found a kickass photography course and margo called up for me only to find out it costs $3,150 up front, FOR 1 FUCKIN YEAR!!!
CENTRELINK:
wait in line to hand in one fuckin form, for at least 20 minutes...
then had to wait in another line to ask about a loan for at least a half hour only to find out i can only loan $350...
THE WALK TO THE TRAIN STATION:
Walk out of building and see a cute dog tied up outside, no one was around so i said, ""helloooooo u little cutie coco puff ooooo"" (in one of them annoying baby talk tones)and right then this stunningly hot guy comes around the friggen corner and i smash into him!!!By this time its well and truely heated up, im sweating like a grimey runt and thirsty as hell...approach 3 guys, 2 in which are ok looking....they were surveying people and i was their next victim, uping my pace i looked down in hope i turn invisible and they dont notice me...but of course they did as the one wearing a saint kilda football top sez, ""hey there gorgeous can we borrow u for 1 second i promise it wont be scary,"" as he held up a form....truely not in the mood, but a little perked up by his cuteness i said nicely....""u see i would but u go for the saints"" and kept walking...the other guy said go the pies, and i said wooo yeah thats the way, which sent them raving like maniacs trying to get me to come back...but i laughed and kept walking...
TRAIN STATION:
In true fashion i only just missed the train...so i stood there, not sittin on the smelly piss ridden seats, as more and more people flocked around me...all reaking of sweat.... 
IN TRAIN: 
Sat where i could see into the next carridge..some really old man who would in no way be able to get his shrivled up dick to bone up, was full on perving on this lady who walked into my carridge..so then he turns around to look at her, and sees me..he just sits there with his head turned back resembling a turtle and looks me up and down with his wrinkled grin, i dunno how i did this but i didnt even think, just happened...i sat there staring back and all of a sudden i stuck my finger up at him...and held it there, until he got all embarassed and turned back around....the people next to me were staring...
WALK HOME FROM TRAIN STATION:
Dripping of sweat in all places all zones, i walk passed a father and his 2 young sons...only to have him seriously stare like his never seen a pair of tits and a pair of legs in his life, and sez to his sons, ""mmmm boys what do u say to having a piece of that, one day you'll be able to have one like her all to yourself, aye""
HOME AND ON THE NET:
Get home, connect and find that the lady i was chattin to last night was really eliza and i didnt break up a friendship, and i went to bed bored when i could of been abusing people in chat rooms with lize, if she had of told me it was her....also george left a note saying he doesnt know how to fix the oven, so now im left with nothing to eat while whats made of the pasta salad is gonna rot...and now i fuckin just got disconnected but im still gonna finish this fuckin entry and reconnect...
So ive still got a whole day left...and it could get worse..knowing my luck today ill get wacked in the head with the soccer ball later on when we go to play.....ohhh fuck i need to pack for the beach...byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee fuck its not letting me connectttt!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","ive gone back to 'fuck everything' mode....why do i always get in nasty moods where i feel like punching someone in the face?
I think a punching bag would be a good idea for me...would help relieve some of my frustrations....i think my moods come from the complete boredom that is my life...its the lack of jobs floating around for the picking..its the motherfuckers who wont hire someone thats said fuck off education,quit university, and has no experience...its the lack of guys with an great personality in this area....its the stupid arguments i have nearly every day with friends and family.....really though i think its cuz i finally, for the first time in my life, know what i wanna be doin career wise and i cant...i cant cuz, trust me to pick an arty career which is hard to make a living on, and costs a zillion dollars to study....but its what ill enjoy doing, its what makes me happy and happyness is worth far more than anything....im fuckin sick of people constantly being on my back about what im gonna do with my life...well friggen sniff ur own ass and take a look at where ur lifes headed before u even attempt to judge mine....and im sick of going out, meeting new people (the wrong people) and when asked what do u do, i have nothing...nothing to interest them in....cuz...i have no life...my life revolves around looking for jobs only to be let down, and laying on the couch eating whatevers in the fridge while watchin jerry springer and passions...is that what the fuckers out there wanna hear? the truth? well thats excactly what i tell em....i dont have to lie to make myself look good...especially to some fuckers who i dont even give two shits about...
so that concludes the story of elly...

"event","I am finally in a good mood!!! but yet very tired...fuck today made me realise how much i luv melbournes city...as much as id definatley prefer to live on the beach without all the pollution and loud shit, the city kicks some major ass...
So today i did pretty good on the shopping department...got 2 albums which i should of gotten a long time ago, but never had the cash...my sparta ticket..wooo and i found an at the drive-in KEY RING...see eliza i can say it u just imagine things u fairy....anyway..the KEY RING..ended up being bodged and fell apart, so i gotta super glue it or sumfin....that kinda put a damper on things but i soon got excited when we finally visited federation square...the new tourist attraction in Australia when ur in melbourne...i fuckin luv looking at art...fell in luv with one piece called 'bust im up' by i forget samantha hobson? i dunno if thats what its called now, but it was kool...there was security everywhere cuz its all u know, posh and trendy expensive paintings in there, and one bloke who looked like he had a ferret rammed up his ass told helen off for touching the artwork...pffft what a wanker....ooohh and there was this building there where u go into these dark rooms and u cant see shit and i kept bumping into neis, and lize, and theres these images of real people projected right next to u...the little girl looked scary, and i was cracking onto the guy who looked like a professor...then there was this other room and the people who work there told us to go in and sit at the back, let our eyes adjust to the dark and then explore...there was a big like movie screen at the front...so we sat there waitin for something to happen...but nothing was...so we kept sittin there and started talkin shit about playing murder in the dark and how helz used to flash her ass or sumfin then this guy who was standing there lookin at us said umm excuse me u need to get up and explore if u wanna see sumfin...(lucky cuz i thought he was gonna yell at us for talkin) so we stood up walkin around like dumb asses lookin at nothing...and finally realised that the screen wasnt flat but a white hole kinda thing...i dunno hard to explain but its more or less an illusion to make u think theres a screen which is gonna play a movie when really theres jack shit...so u could be sittin there 4 ten years trying to work out what the deal is.....checked out some aboriginal art which was kool then went to starbucks cuz its aparently the kool american hang out joint...theeeen walked around the shops and finally now i am home....in shitsville....get me outta here!!!!
ohh and there was this artwork where they had pubes...real pubes..nah i dunno if they were real but they probably were...
And yeah that was the day.......
im kinda starving but all theres to eat is meat and thats a no goer...my socks really reak cuz i was wearing my etnies all day..
Tomorra night we r goin to kris and vics cuz its vics birthday!!!! happy birthday if ur reading this luv....should be kool to catch up...kristy u asshole u made me miss u when i read the book u did for me...its got all the shit we used to get up to...it cracked me up bad...i realised i dont get into as much trouble now cuz ur not around to be partners in crime...remember riding on ur motor bike down the lane, paddock thing and the man had a massive attack and threw massive rocks at us then jumped over the fence and chased us...then my santa hat flew off so u had to ride back with me on the back and i had to jump off and grab it while he threw more rocks...then we yelled at him to get fuked and worse shit and i flashed my boobs at him...then he came looking for us...hahahahaha fuck why r illegal things so fun? ooooo remember ridin ur motey on the half pipe and all the guys playing cricket were perving...or when u rode right next to the sprinklers so id get soaking wet? 
ohhh fuck those were the days...."

Yesterday i posted this massive ass entry only to have the internet fuck me over...outside was weird it was all foggy and u could smell the bushfires...felt like there was fires in my street...
on sunday ive gotta go to the crown in the city with mitsey and all her friends cuz its her birthday party...really not lookin forward to it cuz she will wanna go into them clubs which play doof doof and r&b all the sleazy fucks will grab onto my body parts ill end up kneeing one in the balls by the end of the night...all her friends which i havent met will love the music and they will all be shaking their asses on the dance floor, while i..sober from lack of money, will be standing in a dark corner with at least 1 beer in hand, wondering what the fuck im doin there. Some hairy sweaty muzz guy wearing a singlet to show off his muscles, will see me alone and as an opportunity to pick up will approach me...probably only to have me look up at him long enough to utter the words ""get fucked"" then he will hopefully boot off, while i continue to cherish my beer and wish for some kickass guy, who wouldnt normally be found in a place like that, to come up to me so we can discuss how much we wanna get outta there...then of course we will end up sharing some really amazing kiss...and he WILL be a good kisser...not like every other male ive kissed who seems to think the 'washing machine' approach is the way to go...well anyways i guess we will have to wait and see what happens...but i promised mitsey id go so i will...
Today i was thinkin about gettin another tat...the old skool one of a naked lady...but i cant think of where to put it...want this one to be fairly hidden...

'The One' who i will be with for the rest of my life and who i wont get sick of after 2 days as has been known to happen...'The One' ill grow old with and have to feed him his tablets to help him get it up, and 'The One' who isnt gonna mind touching my boobs when there old, saggy and droop down to my knees...."

"event","fuck......most used word in my vocab...helps describe words to their fullest...fuuuuuuck im so fuckin sick of the shit i have to put up with from centreshit!!!!!!!!!!!
Had an early appointment with em today for fuck knows what reason...so i fuckin well get outta bed on the crack of dawn after AGAIN!! having no sleep in mums bed from the night spider invasion of my room!!! get to centreshit 15 fucking minutes early...and sit there for 40 fuckin minutes waiting for my god damn name to get called out....but no...at least 20 others got called out...i sat there getting fuckin extremely annoyed while a family of muslims sat on either end of me yellin over the top, and i seriously had to dodge the mans arms twice or i would of gotten hit..his freakin breath smelt like raw shit which he was directing my way, and the woman smelt like dirty fuckin fanny....the man was also fuckin lookin me up and down whilst sittin no more than a few cm's away...one of their little kids started grabbing onto my leg...but i sat there, boiling up inside...then some psycho man chose me out of all the fuckin 100 people in there to start having a skitz attack at...he turned around looked at me and started saying something bout having to wait on the top of hills, then came stood in front of me and started yelling out about jam and hitting boxes.... finally after sittin there squeezing the fuck out of my key chain i lined up to ask what the fucks the deal...couldnt contain my anger but still managed to tell the lady nicely that i have an appointment...she said that i was meant to go upstairs!!!!!cuz they fuckin changed the system a fuckin round  but still someone was meant to come down and call me...which they fuckin were for other fuckin people....but that wasnt enough for me so i RUDELY ASKED ""so why wasnt my appointment carried out"" she noticed i was very much about to explode and said ohhhh i dont know but dont worry u wont get breached for this another appointment time for u will be made!!! SO IN OTHER WORDS I CAME ALL THE FUCKIN WAY DOWN THERE AND HAD TO SIT BETWEEN 2 FREAKIN REAK POTS WHILE HAVING TO LISTEN TO SOME ANNOYING ROBOT SONG 5 TIMES ON SOME KIDS SHOW ON TV, AND NEARLY HAVE A PSYCHO KILL ME, ONLY TO HAVE TO COME BACK AGAIN!!!!!!!!!
After that i serioulsy dint give a shit and stormed out of there muttering fucking hell as people stared their asses off...but it didnt matter cuz some other guy was doin the exact same thing.....
Have noticed when im really fuckin mad my nostril kinda has a spasm where it flares out..hard to describe...
After this event i very much doubt id be good company and cant see me goin to the flicks tonight...i really dont think i can sit there without bashing someones head in...."

"event","To: Anyone and Everyone i have EVER screwed over,

     I would like to say I Stephanie Lynn Wright am truely and honestly sorry for anything I have ever done to you. you may believe whatever it is you would like to believe but only I will know exactly how I really feel. If you do not want to except my apologie that is fine. I am sorry If i did not try hard enough to fix things between you and I that is just how I am I guess I just give up too easily. I just do not want to go through all that again. If you do not want to believe that I am sorry please just leave it at that. Do not bring it up (example: writing it in your journals) and if you have done the same EXACT thing to me then DO NOT go complaining about it. I am sorry and I will leave it at that.

                                  Sincerly,
                             Stephanie Lynn Wright  




P.s. This was basiclly directed to 3 main people."

"event","Today was such a great day. 
 i woke up at about 6:30ish*am* cuz i got some stupid text message on my phone cuz my sister was trying to text me... so i called my sister and we talked for a bit because she needed to ask me some questions about her coming down here to visit us. well i was sneezing alot so my mommy gave me some medicine that made me really tired after about an hour and  i slept untill about 10ish and i had to go to school because Danny had left his stuff in my car from the day before when he came over. so i went to school and i made it there a little after 2nd period started.. i went through the day like normal except i got really mad at mr. simmons today (he is such a complete asshole) then in 3rd period are computers wouldn't work so we went out side and played freeze tag but i didn't feel like playing so i just sat and watched :) then i took jill home and i went home and waited impaitently for my sister to get here with her baby so i could see my nephew (:D) he is so adorable... but then i needed to get outta the house because i was bored and danny had invited me to dinner with his family so i went out with them and i had the best time ever! *i <i>love</i> his family, they are amazing* then we went to walmart for a little bit and danny got some movie he wanted and we went back to his house for a little and we played grand theft auto vice city and then i fell asleep and his mommy wouldn't let me drive home because she said i was too tired to drive so danny called my mommy while i was sleeping and he worked everything out for me and his sister brought me home *which was extremly nice of her* and when we got to my house my sister was standing out side and she gave danny a hug and said sorry about some stupid shit she had done in the past *she is such a stupid <b>white</b> girl* then danny came in and tucked me into bed and made me a nice away message :) and then he left but i couldn't sleep so i layed on the couch..waiting for him to call me and now i am talking to him*phone* and i am talking to <strike>bridgette</strike>*online*and i am so happy i have him... he is seriously the best boyfriend ever.

christian people are suck dicks... well some of them at least... some old guy walked up to ricky *who btw was wearing a shirt that said '666' across it multiple times* and he got right in his face and was like ""jesus died on the cross for you and you aren't showing him much respect and you are not going to amount to anything in you life with an attitude of not believing in jesus"" and we were all sittin there trying so hard not to laugh and then we saw him later and we started sitting by him saying some fucked up shit, it was funny :)

"event","I'm sitting here crying cuz he left to go home. It has <i>never</i> been so difficult for me to say good-bye to someone b4. It hurt so bad for me to turn around and walk away from him. I know i will talk to him when he gets home but for this short time that i can't talk to him or see him this time where i just can't be around him it hurts and i don't know why it hurts so bad. I'm crying and i feel so pathetic because of that. I have never felt this way about a person b4 i've never always wanted to be around someone this much, usually people annoy me and get on my nerves but for some reason i'm not bothered by him at all. I can be around him all day and not once am i annoyed/bothered by him. and sometimes i feel like i do annoy him or i do bother him and i don't want to bother/annoy him:-/ eh idk

well anyway tonight was good for the most part. american wedding is a pretty funny movie but i still liked the first and second one the best:D I'm waiting for them to make a movie where one of the people have a kid haha. 

k well now im talking to hilary ((who btw is sexy)) and i can't write anymore.

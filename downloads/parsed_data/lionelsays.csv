There are of course plenty of criticisms you can level at the French team.

1. They are incredibly lazy. Often they just boot the ball up the pitch and hope Henry does something magical with it (which he invariably doesn't). Sometimes Henry himself just decides to stop dead and give up. They only energise when they're teetering on the brink of elimination.

2. Their goalkeeper is a LIABILITY!

3. They find it incredibly hard to score goals a lot of the time, despite having supposedly excellent strikers.

BUT...BUT...they STILL manage to produce magic, despite their technical flaws and ageing players. They were clearly superior for the second half and extra time. SO WHY DID ZIDANE DECIDE TO PULL A CANTONA IN THE LAST MINUTES OF THE LAST GAME OF HIS LAST TOURNAMENT? I don't care what was said, even if it was about his race or his bald head, but that headbutt was way worse than anything Rooney has done. I've lost all respect for him and if I was ten years younger I would symbolically burn a Zidane football shirt and vow to defeat him in mortal combat someday."

"event","One of the great bits about studying Political Islam is that you get to see recruitment videos. My teacher played us a film made by Indonesian Islamists - not sure if it was Jamaa Islamiyaa itself - designed to recruit Middle Easterners. The footage was mainly of exceptionally gruesome deaths. Children with three quarters of their necks blown off, men with their brains falling out, decapitations. It was pretty powerful. The idea was simply that Muslims were being massacred, and the ominous footage of churches and Bill Clinton made it clear who was responsible. There was an unbelievable moment when the armed police just stood around and watched as a loony with a sword chased after this guy and kept landing exceptionally violent blows. The victim became progressively unable to stand up, his clothes were red with blood and half his scalp was flapping around - and the police couldn't even take control of the situation. By the end of it, I felt like joining the Islamist cause myself, maybe create some special Jewish Corps...

...until the teacher explained that they'd basically edited footage from completely unrelated separatist and tribal conflicts in order to give the impression that this was all part of the suppression of Muslims. I really am too easily swayed.

After spending hours installing software so that my mum could transfer a picture of me and my sister onto her computer, I thought I'd be able to leave in peace. I was wrong.

Mother: ""What did you name ze file?""
Me: ""Dunno.""

So I hastily made my excuses and ran home to do some work. But instead I'm watching 'Notting Hill'. God knows why. I think it's because I've slowly come to the horrifying realisation that I am just like Hugh Grant. I sound like him, I walk like him, I bumble like him, I have that ridiculous way of speaking with all its 'ums' and 'ahs' and supposedly witty comments that just merit a slap in the face.

I forced Julian to be there for 10am - and the letter did say 'come early' - but me and every single earnest foreign student out there had had the same idea. We're talking about seven floors of queue, made up exclusively of giggly New Yorkers. Simon and Ben, meanwhile, turned up at 1pm and got it all done in five minutes. Typical. We took a look round the university, it seems fine apart from the 'London School of Alcoholics' 'joke' that is peppered everywhere. 

We had lunch at a bar called 'Spreads' in Covent Garden. On the menu, it said 'Good food for nice people', loosely translated as 'You don't have the GUTS to complain about the shit you've just swallowed'. And, well, I didn't. The waitress sighed angrily after every single request, as though getting for the bill meant retrieving a dodo egg in Nepal. And yet, once again, Julian wouldn't let me leave without putting a 10% tip.

We then walked across Waterloo bridge and sat near South Bank. Julian's going to Amsterdam this weekend, so he kept getting calls from people wanting bulk purchases of marijuana. Apparently 'King Hassan Cream', 'Neville Haze' and 'AK-47' are not rappers but marijuana brands.

"event","Ah, Paris. For many reasons I love thee. First is probably the cinema. There are apparently 368 screens in Paris, and, unbelievably, not every film has Gerard Depardieu in it. You just don't get the chance to see as many classic films in the cinema over here. In 2003 there was a review of the choice of films in London from the London Assembly:

""In a snapshot survey of 68 films on show outside the West End during a week in August, the committee found that more than 75% of the screenings were for just six movies: Terminator 3, Pirates of the Caribbean, What a Girl Wants, Rugrats Go Wild, Spy Kids 3 and Legally Blonde 2.""

Mmm, sequels. Taste even better with a five pound bucket of popcorn.

Anyway, this particular trip was a family run so I didn't have much time for sight-seeing. I discovered some pretty tragic things about my cousins: one of them, 17 years old and male, asked me with excited eyes if I'd ever seen 'The OC'. Maybe I shouldn't have laughed in his face, but he then went on to defend it, saying that there was a Jewish family in it and they were funny. Did I miss something? I thought The OC was about hunky teenagers going to the mall in California. I don't remember seeing a bunch of unhealthy Jews coughing in the corner anywhere.

I was invited to a club night organised by the Union of French-Jewish Students (I'm detecting a theme here). Even though everyone kept coming up to me and screaming at me because Oxford University had offered a place to Tariq Ramadan, I still managed to have a good time. The DJ played four Arabic pop classics, which got the kind of reception normally reserved in this country for the winners of the Ashes (without the boring grumbly guy at the back muttering that things were better in 1923).

Predictably enough for a Jewish night, I caught cold the next day. I'm now at Becky's shivering because she's only just revealed to me how to turn the fire on. She will ALWAYS leave out some crucial part of the instructions - like 'flick the secret switch behind the wall', or 'stand WELL back' - which leaves me begging like a fool after ten minutes of masculine shame.

We saw 'Wolf Creek' last night. SUCH a disappointment. Imagine Texas Chainsaw Massacre but with a bad guy who is just Steve Irwin. I mean fine, Steve doesn't usually try to rape anyone, but if he did you wouldn't be that scared. Believe me."

They announced that Wednesday night was 'improv night', at which point Kaveh and I looked at each other with worried expressions. I fear improv. Improv always ends up in stupid surrealism, like 'Why no, I'm using this banana...to polish Kaiser Wilhelm's helmet!' But it was really, genuinely, gut bustingly funny. They even had Josie Lawrence off Whose Line Is It Anyway. The only downside was that I was sat next to a scary white-haired guy in leathers who refused to laugh at anything. He just scowled. The only things he liked were the musical numbers, to which he'd tap his toes and drum his knees happily. Why go to the Comedy Store for the music? That's like going to a gig for the witty on-stage banter. Which, if you're a U2 fan, is a horrible idea.

Tonight Julian made us meet up in Farringdon. AGAIN. To be honest it has become a very trendy place. We had dinner at an Italian restaurant, which I always enjoy because I get to order my food with a ridiculous accent. My friends hate it. Apparently I'm a 'pretentious cock'. But I ask you! What is so pretentious about making an effort once in a while, huh? Julian asked me, 'Imagine if you heard a group of Italians at an English restaurant asking 'ah madam, please supply us with some steak and kidney pudding and a flagon of ale'.' His point needed the existence of an English restaurant, as well as Italians willing to go to it, so it didn't fly. Usually I get embarrassed really easily at restaurants, so I tried really hard to care, but I just don't. I love it.

We went to a bar which had table football, and two French guys challenged us to a game. One of them was...amazing. He had a cigarette in his mouth THROUGHOUT. He had this terrifying special move where one of his defenders would stop the ball, tap it three times and then torpedo it into our goal. All while smoking! The illusion was broken when I asked them how they found this place. 'Oh we searched on the internet for bars with table football'. I may have lost the game, but I win at life.

This Sunday my mother will meet most of Becky's family. I'm very nervous. No reason, really, because she's really nice and sweet and so is Becky's family, but...I guess I just want it all to go smoothly.

An incredible feeling of worthlessness passed over me as Pete - who couldn't end a sentence without intoning a non-existent question mark - told me that I hadn't been 'successful'. I felt like he was condemning me to a lifetime of homelessness and hitch-hiking. I sort of knew that I'd failed when he'd said 'can you keep to the left please!?' while driving...I also fucked up a double mini roundabout (TWO roundabouts? Why? WHY? I swear the ultimate dream for town planners is to see cars slowly revolving everywhere) and didn't spot a silver car coming towards me as I crossed its path. Anyway, I spent all day going over the test and rationalising it, so that by 6pm I'd become convinced that it was all the instructor's fault. Having come to this delightful conclusion, I now have to wait two months before the next available test.

""Que venez-vous faire en Angleterre?""

I then did my Hugh Grant thing, spoke in English, stuttered a bit, but basically made it clear that I was concealing no hook or eyepatch.

""Where precisely were you born in Paris?""

Jesus. Sadly I was born in a faceless clinic somewhere in the city, rather than next to a recognisable landmark like the Louvre, or at the top of the Eiffel Tower. After more mumbling, I ended up having to sign my way out of there. Still, if I'd been Portuguese it would have been bye-bye brain.

Such a nice weekend, though. The food! I was sat in a cafe in Paris, and the waiter brought me a toasted ham and cheese sandwich (it's ok because it's got a French name). Now obviously it was lovely, but the side salad! The side salad was gorgeous, all soft and tender and drizzled with vinaigrette. The cigarette-sucking Frenchies must have been shocked to see me come in my pants because of a side salad. It's just I'm used to generic 'token' side salads, crunchy, watery, lacking in any discernible quality. 

I passed the time by asking my dad about his actions in 1968, which he claimed involved organising an insurrection at his college. He said he'd written a political tract titled 'We Stand Alone'. All very inspiring, until he said he'd caught the flu and it had all ended with him sneezing and coughing in bed. He then entertained me with his frankly deranged political opinions, from 'the Arabs don't have balls, they need to wage a proper war' to 'until North America is controlled or destroyed, the world will never be safe'. In case the authorities are reading this, my father doesn't look Arabic or Portuguese so you have nothing to fear.

I convinced my father to let me drive him round the countryside, which he made worse by making me start in third gear. Honestly, he's supposed to know how to drive. After realising his mistake, he explained he was '75 to 80% responsible'. He's got an incredible knack for quantifying blame. If he killed a man, he would probably only claim 65% responsibility due to the power of destiny. Anyway, while I was driving he decided to use confusing French expressions to help my positioning: 'tu vas trop a droite, tu vas dans les choux!' ('you're going too far right, you're going into the cabbages') and 'il faut epouser le virage' ('you have to marry the bend'). All the talk of cabbage and marriage basically led to driving chaos.

The tv was great fun too. We watched a 70s cop thriller called 'Le Professionnel' (I won't patronise you by translating that) which was all fine and dandy until the bad guys began to intimidate the hero's girlfriend. A young blonde woman ripped off her clothes and started to whisper, 'you've got a good body, shall we go and soap up?' It was completely idiotic. I shout at my father, 'what a ridiculous excuse to get women naked!' He replied, 'no no it's very well thought out. It's a threat of rape.' Now to me, it seemed more like a threat of hot lesbo action, but he probably knows his stuff."

That guy has got to start doing something different. I know, I know, he tried to branch out with Planet of the Apes and Big Fish - I didn't even bother seeing the latter - but if I see one more Burton film start with a snowy, bleak, Gothic cityscape I'm going to have a seizure. There was even a trailer for his NEXT Gothic-snowy masterpiece, 'The Corpse Bride', in which he's managed to combine 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (his Gothic-snowy animation) with all of his other films (Gothic-snowy-Johnny Depp). At least his German antecedents in the 1930s managed to produce something different on occasion. Burton, though, doesn't seem at all bored by it. He's even branched out into literature, bringing lots of Gothic snow to his 'Oyster Boy' short stories. In case you couldn't guess, Oyster Boy is a lonely outcast oyster who ends up eaten by his parents (this is what someone else has told me, so I may be missing the subtle craft of his writing). Who is buying all of this stuff? I guess, as Becky pointed out, 'there are always going to be fat Goths'.

I bought 'Civilization III' a few days ago, which, as any pasty-faced boy can tell you, was a seriously bad move. I spend hours moving little men with swords over grassy plains so they can fight other men with swords. I become moody if anyone tries to get me to stop.

It looked like a Stock Exchange, but for bras: the stock had to be flogged for dirt cheap, and these otherwise classy ladies would have to shout and raise their hands in order to get hold of it. My mother ran into the crowd, while I stood back with the outer ring of baffled men.

There's something so mystical about bra sizes. The saleswoman kept shouting out letters and numbers: '32DD!' '26B!' The problem was that whoever stuck their hand out and grabbed the G-string/bra/suspender belt (and there were some very strange-looking women there) appeared very briefly in my brain wearing said item. I'm just glad I didn't notice my mother getting much. In fact all she did was shout at the other women - 'put your arms down, we can't see what she's holding up!' Very, very embarrassing.

Whereas before you could expect to find some news somewhere, maybe even a crossword, now every single rag is bursting at the seams with reams and reams of opinion. Forget news, or even facts, this season's new look is a relentless onslaught of opinions that never change. Television is even worse, because of that dreaded pop-up at the bottom of the screen: 'Have Your Say'. Why is it those three magic words make people act like they've been offered a publishing deal with Faber & Faber? Every schmoe with a phone number immediately blesses the viewing public with their fucking opinion on everything from foreign policy to fossil fuels. Call me antisocial but I really don't want to hear what some housewife in Grimsby thinks about geopolitics - I'd actually like to hear someone who knows what they're talking about. Yet another reason why democracy is terrifying.

What is also terrifying is that I have a driving test in under four weeks' time. I'd be okay if it wasn't for roundabouts. I don't understand them. I don't like them. I'm taking my test in an area that seems to treat roundabouts like magical crop circles that should be cherished wherever they pop up. When Becky drives me anywhere I just sit there praising her for every roundabout she conquers. When I see her do a really complicated, manly gear change - like from fifth to first - my jaw hits the floor like she's just played a series of diminished sevenths. Anyway, I'm crap at driving.

Last night I went to a club in Farringdon, which is the weirdest place to put a club. It's next to the Barbican and a famous meat market which I think is called Smithfields? Yeah I know, I'm a crap Londoner, sorry Ken. Anyway, it was as usual full of old Westminsters, including a very annoying lad called Will Dunbar. He was wearing a cowboy-style shirt, with a red cut-out shape covering the shoulders and collar area. He had this really loud student voice, which perfectly suited his hi-larious tactic of pointing at haircuts and shouting 'MULLET!' or 'HOXTON FIN!' He's one of those people who just does not shut up, to the point where you're not sure whether you're breathing air or just his vomitous personality. It was unstoppable. I had to take a cab home with him and Julian, and it was humiliating just watching him talk to strangers. He would slap one poor guy on the shoulder and say 'Now my good man, how much to take me to Maida Vale?' He then hailed a black cab and called the driver 'Monsieur'. 'Monsieur', for fuck's sake! The cab ride home consisted of him yelling at the top of his voice about how much he enjoyed getting rejected by girls (why is it people who have no luck with girls always say that?) and all about the psychology of dating. 
  'What,' he boomed, 'is so twisted with MEN that they want to sleep with WOMEN?' 
  'Well, it's natural, it's just how it goes,' replied Julian. 
  'IF ONLY! It's because it's part of our... our gender roles,' came the predictable reply. If there's something I can't stand it's pop psychology, so I opened the door at Marble Arch and walked home."

According to Le Monde, meanwhile, there seems to be a path leading to a Moroccan group who were accused of attacks in Casablanca in 2003 (and the Madrid bombings). Obviously it's too soon to tell, but it would lead to a rather different motive than the above group's.

The link: http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3214,36-670744@51-670628,0.html

My translation: ""The valiant mudjahadeens - warriors - carried out the commendable
conquest of London. And here is Great Britain trembling with fear,
terror and shock, from north to south and east to west (...) The time
has now come for revenge upon the Zionist crusading British
government, as payback for the massacres being committed in Iraq and
Afghanistan by Great Britain. We again clarify that the governments of
Denmark and Italy and all others taking part in the Crusade will face
the same punishment.""

It would be naive to claim, as some seem to do, that the terrorist attacks in Europe have absolutely nothing to do with what's happening in the Middle East. I'm not saying that it's a straightforward matter of Cause and Effect, but the problem is that it's providing terrorists with a concrete political goal which (in their minds) legitimises such attacks."

I would like to say, though, that I don't think the London attack was motiveless, nor was it in a completely different world from IRA attacks of the past. The Docklands bombing in 1996 is the event that sticks out the most in my mind, along with the countless nail-bombs in pubs that were blown up on a regular basis. They affected the 'working class', as Ken Livingstone termed it, and just because the IRA's motives seem clear to us there is no use pretending their bombs had some sort of political logic to them. Sometimes they would target politicians explicitly, but more often than not civilians got caught in the crossfire. Terrorism in the 20th century has never been rosy, and while the scale of the London attacks definitely outdoes anything previously attempted, it is still terrorism as practised by small militant groups everywhere.

In terms of motives, it seems to be pretty much a replay of the 11th March 2004 attacks. With one big caveat: in Madrid the bombings took place just before a general election, so the terrorists could hope for some change, but obviously things are different here. Only one MP in one constituency managed to gain political ground for opposing the Iraq war (and some frankly barmy nonsense about Palestine) and so these attacks are all the more idiotic. Galloway's little trumpet will seem even more pathetic now.

What yesterday's attacks seem to show is that even with the suspension of habeas corpus, even with highly repressive legislation, even with people being arrested for having a few bags of fertiliser in their basement, you can't really stop people bent on destruction. I really, really hope that these attacks are not used as a pretext for more erosion of civil liberties, but instead as a realisation that terrorism is something that cannot always be blown away with a tank.

"event","Don't you hate it when you look at clothes you've been wearing a lot and you realise that there's something really embarrassing printed on them? I bought a t-shirt with what I thought was some abstract white alien-type shape on it, and all was well until I stood outside Bath Spa station. A pair of chubby 12-year old schoolboys walked past me and they both stared at my chest with barely-concealed sexual excitement, their nostrils flaring as they giggled to each other. I looked down and suddenly the black area in front of the white shape revealed itself to be a ridiculous comic book wank-fantasy woman with her arse sticking out. I honestly never realised until that moment. Underneath this woman were the words 'Best Grip'...I guess there's some innuendo in that. Becky didn't look too happy when she picked me up, she would not stop asking me what 'Best Grip' meant. As if I know!

Just now I also realised that I never check the back of t-shirts properly either. I have one with a red cowboy on the cover, which looks fine and dandy until you look at the back that declares me the 'Sheriff of Chickasha County'. I'm GUESSING Chickasha County doesn't exist and in fact it just means I like sexy women. 

Basically I just want a blanket ban on cheesily 'rude' t-shirts. The obvious ones can go too, like the hilarious 'It's Not Going To Suck Itself' (with an arrow pointing to the crotch in case the complicated pun isn't understood). It's not that I think women are beautiful, powerful and shouldn't be treated as sex objects - I just don't want to walk around with some big-boobed woman on my chest looking like Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons."

"event","Only I could end up being fired from work experience after only two days. Who the hell gets sacked from an unpaid job? It's like volunteering for charity work and being told that you're no longer wanted because your tomato soup lacks finesse. I don't think it was ENTIRELY my fault...at least I've persuaded myself that it's not. I just kept making little mistakes like not leaving the office number at the end of voicemail messages, or losing my way through the figures on Excel. My boss, a young Irishman with a flair for whirlwind swearing, obviously made things worse. If I'm making the odd mistake when everything's fine, how am I going to improve after being told to 'GET ON THE FUCKING CASE'? The worst part was that he calmed down every so often, apologising or saying I was 'a good guy'. Then I'd get a phone number wrong and he'd scream 'THAT WAS SO FUCKING DUMB YOU'VE DONE THE ONE THING I FUCKING HATE'. I really should have said something lame like 'hey man, take a chill pill' just to see him really fly off the handle.

This left me feeling very unwanted, so I ran into Becky's arms for some comfort. Her mum had brought home Rufus, the new kitten, so I spent the weekend watching the poor guy go to the toilet. He's such a showman, he refuses to actually urinate or defecate unless someone is watching him and goading him on. 

It's my sister's birthday tomorrow. I've outdone myself in the shit present stakes, spending 10 minutes in Selfridges and coming out with a world music CD and a Cairo cookery book. It's her 21st as well. Sheesh!"

"event","So, after the initial high of finishing my degree comes the dawning awareness that I need a job. How strange that the fine line between being 'free' and being 'unemployed' only lasts about a week.

I met up with my old piano teacher Richard, who was still shaken from having to write the 'Guinea Pig Song' for professional arse Joe Pasquale. He probably wasn't the right guy to talk about a job to, seeing as he'd just turned down a high-profile desk job at Faber & Faber in order to carry on teaching annoying brats. I murmured something about teaching guitar, and we ended up convincing each other that I should run into the library and put an ad up. The fact that I have no teaching experience, no qualifications and only the solo to 'stairway to heaven' under my belt didn't seem to matter.

We looked over the library notice-board: only one ad for guitar lessons, but it was a good one. The guy's name was 'Rodrigo' (exotic!) and he promised bass/electric/acoustic lessons for ALL levels. He even said he had teaching experience. He was my new arch-nemesis. I sat down with Richard and we began to write my ad. Because there was so little to write, it ended up sounding like an ad offering kinky massage. 'Will visit...Experienced performer...' I may as well have cut my losses and offered a free handjob.

Anyway, it's up now, and even if nobody likes me I'll still get 15-20 quid for the first lesson each time. My ideal client would be some 8-year old kid who's never picked up the guitar - I could be teaching him the basics for months! My worst client would be somebody older than me, better than me...actually I could just teach him the basics too.

I rang Frank at Swipe Films, like he asked me to. He asked me, 'how are you with Microsoft Excel?' and then told me to ring him back tomorrow. I immediately ran out and bought 'Excel for Dummies' - this is how desperate I am for work."

"event","I've finished my exams, finished my degree and finished, uh, my last pack of oat, fruit & chocolate biscuits. Urg. Last day of exams fulfilled the usual 'Twattish Oxford Tradition' criteria, sadly not involving suicidal jumps from the bridge. Instead a huge crowd gathers outside the exam building and throws eggs, confetti, champagne bottles and silly string at whoever's in sight. I'm really glad nothing hit me because otherwise I would've embarrassed myself by screaming, 'OH THANKS! MY SUIT IS RUINED! WHO'S GOING TO PAY THE BILL, HUH? YOU? YOU? I HATE YOU ALL, YOU'VE DESTROYED MY LIFE!' And then I would have stomped off in tears while the entire crowd stood awkwardly in silence.

I went home and put on my favourite scabby Metallica hoodie before joining my friends and tutors at the pub. Hannah was being really annoying, as most drunk people are - she kept leaning over me and gurgling 'ALL RIGHT? YOU ALL RIGHT?' She then stuck her fingers into somebody's Coke glass and pulled out a lemon slice for her to suck on. Now I could forgive Lindsay Lohan if she'd done that, but not Hannah. No way. They all went off to grab a 'punt' - basically like a Venetian gondola but seriously unsexy and often full of drunk students covered in their own puke. Just think about what Oxford Street has done to the concept of the limousine (ie filled it with screaming ten year old girls pissed on Hooch) and multiply it by ten.

I finally got to see Becky after weeks apart! I hadn't turned on a tv in weeks so I couldn't understand why everyone around me was mumbling under their breath, 'BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BIM BIM BIM, B'GAW B'GAW THAT FROG'S SO CRAZY'. Only two days later I'd seen that advert 298 times. Suddenly everything Becky and I did, everything we said, everything we ran out of the house for, was ALL TO AVOID THE CRAZY FROG. Life wasn't about fighting boredom, it was about fighting Him. We went to see Star Wars III, which was disappointing even by someone ready to be disappointed. Lucas has outdone himself by creating the worst villain ever - General Grievous, a chain-smoking computer-generated Italian robot with lung cancer. He also has attempted to introduce POLITICS into the mix! This just made the dialogue even worse. Suddenly the fight wasn't about Good against Evil. The Jedi spoke like MPs, saying things like 'We don't deal in absolutes. This is about democracy!' Sorry chum, but you can't do an epic space opera romance WITHOUT absolutes. Whenever Samuel L Jackson had to defend republican values, he did so by saying 'Use your feelings.' FEELINGS!? For fuck's sake, feelings only work when you're tapping the mystical Force to fight evil, not when you're trying to organise a UN vote. The last two duels were great, except the ending was completely fluffed with a naff-looking Vader screaming 'Noooooo!' into the camera while stomping about like he was auditioning for The Munsters. Tripe.

Speaking of republican values...sigh...the EU Constitution is about to fall on its arse. I might find myself saying very soon, 'Not tonight, love, I can't stop thinking about federal Europe.' Has anyone actually READ the constitution? I think the 'No' campaign is depending on a lot of people's ignorance of what it actually contains. How else could the French mount a huge attack on its liberal, free-market agenda while the English rant against its typically bureaucratic protectionist economics? HOW? And the press coverage is absolutely ridiculous as usual. The Sunday Times, supposedly a serious paper, just clearly had no knowledge of how French politics worked. Bah. Humbug."

I get all confident, start telling myself what a great year I've had, not an ounce of vitamin C and I'm the fittest Jew in the Northern hemisphere...then I fall ill. Head, nose, throat completely shot. I feel so sorry for the girls sitting next to me in the exam, I spent most of this morning playing a beautiful symphony with my nose and amassing a small fortune in used tissues. The invigilator (sounds terrifying...THE INVIGILATOR...but actually he's a sweet guy who can't stop smiling and is really nice, I bet if I whispered to him 'you couldn't go and get me a bacon sandwich could you?' he'd nod enthusiastically and get one) kept bringing over a huge cardboard box for me to sweep all my used tissues into. It was a pretty crap exam, I basically turned in a militantly sexist rant about how women had it pretty good in the 17th century actually so let's keep them away from the polling booths. Basically.

Actually there's a lot of shit isn't there? I'm especially not looking forward to the homage to William Blake featuring everyone from Sinead O'Connor to Tori Amos. The idea of Tori reading out 'Jerusalem' fills me with horror. ""And did those MEN / In ancient times / BEAT THEIR WIVES...""

I hate the way blockbuster hype means that I never feel excited about films anymore. I just think ""oh yeah, I'd better go and see that new Star Wars then"" with all the excitement of someone who's been offered a lifetime subscription to 'Pasteurisation Weekly'. Then I sit there watching the film thinking ""What's the point? Why have I given George Lucas money? I mean, I do like my films to contain SOMETHING tangible, something real, not loads of actors staring slack-jawed at a blue screen upon which some geeky programmer has pasted a badly-rendered image of Jabba the Hutt"". That, I think, is when you know you've cracked the skill of movie-making: when people just go and see a film because they feel they have to."

"event","Dear Englishmen and Englishwomen,

I read this piece today on the BBC News website about the bi-centenary celebrations of a certain sea battle in 1805:

----
Instead of the British taking on a French/Spanish fleet at next month's event to mark the battle's bicentenary a ""red"" force will take on a ""blue"". 

Navy organisers fear visiting officials may be embarrassed at seeing their side beaten, The Sunday Times reported. 

Portsmouth MP Mike Hancock said an event which did not acknowledge who the enemy was is ""absolute twaddle"". 

The Lib Dem MP said: ""If we are going to re-enact it we should do it properly. I am sure the French do not pull any punches when they celebrate Napoleon's victories. 

""The French will be there - let's not rub it in but at least be accurate. I see no reason why we should not be out there proud as punch proclaiming it."" 

He said it was unlikely the decision was made by a serving naval officer and concluded it must have been ""a faceless bureaucrat somewhere who thinks their next posting might be in Paris."" 

One event sponsor said: ""Surely 200 years on we can afford to gloat a bit."" 

""Not even the French can try and get snooty about this."" 

Official literature for the event refers to ""an early 19th-century sea battle"" instead of the Battle of Trafalgar, The Sunday Times said. 
----

Oh THANK you, England! Thank you so much! I came to your country a poor, orphaned French child. I expected to be kicked out as a 'vulgar Bonapartist' but you were so kind to me. The effects of the Battle of Trafalgar (o woe, that unhappy day) on the French mindset cannot be overestimated. Every day the French people wake up and cry for a full 45 minutes because of that fateful defeat. Yes, even 200 years later they still cry. They respect the great Nelson - he may have been, how you say, a 'poofter', but we would gladly have let Hardy kiss Talleyrand if it would have sealed the victory. I have grown up under the wing of the proud descendants of Wellington, and I am happy that still you hold back from feeling 'proud as punch' (what a quaint, beautiful English expression!) when re-creating the battle of T...Tra... the battle with the reds and the blues. I am so happy that, after insinuating that the French are sore losers, 'snooty' and liable to enjoy the company of 'faceless bureaucrats', the English still try their hardest to avoid French-bashing.

I must go now because I am about to cry. I hope that in 2040, when doubtless you will celebrate the German invasion of France, you will take care to give the armies diplomatic monikers such as 'Krauts' and 'Cheese-Eating Surrender-Monkeys'.

Yours humbly,

Rene Bonaparte"

""SPEAK OUT

Have you noticed something odd about the Tories' campaign against beggars and fake asylum seekers?
There isn't one.
The silence from Hague and his men is deafening.
Why? When The Sun said last week that Britain has had enough, we were spot-on.
Your calls and letters prove how strong public opinion is...
Don't be timid, William. This is a real issue that enrages voters.
For goodness sake, ask Tony Blair some difficult questions about it today.""

How unlucky of Michael Howard to take the hint and apply it five years later, only to find the same paper even more keen on Blair than usual.

And how weird is the tone? It's like Queen Victoria: ""Don't be timid, William...for goodness sake"". Scolding, yet erotically charged."

""We Blair-watchers had instantly noticed [his] eye. It was the right eye. The left eye has always had a somewhat manic gleam, while the right eye seemed comparatively normal. But yesterday the right eye told us a very different story. It was the Optic of Dorian Gray.
 
""It was dark and hooded. It was a very suspicious eye. Now and again it almost closed completely, rather like the eye belonging to a boxer when the ref stops the fight in the 13th round. And when it was open, the right eye seemed to have a life of its own, acting independently of the rest of the Blair visage. At one point it actually blinked on its own.

""The left eye looked round the room, cheerfully spotting old friends and sparring partners: Andy, Mike, George and Adam. But the right eye gazed balefully at these same people as if it were warning its naive partner, the left eye, not to trust them.""

Er...right. The Optic of Dorian Gray. So Blair is now an effete Edwardian homosexual with a nice by-line in immoral cover-ups. Thanks to Simon Hoggart for proving that gonzo journalism has not died out with Hunter S. Thompson."

My mother got up and said she was feeling really ill, and at that point I knew it was going to be a bad day. I love her to bits, but whenever she's a tiny bit ill, she acts like she's being read the last rites. For the rest of the day she clutched her stomach, stopped in the middle of the street, whispered dramatically ""no...no...it's fine...you walk along...I'll be right behind you...""

We went to an exhibition at the Grand Palais called ""Poussin, David, Watteau..."" From those names you can immediately tell we're dealing with the luminaries of late Renaissance French art, can't you? Well in fact there was only ONE David painting, and about four Poussins. The rest were all 'inspired by'. Still, they were all pretty good:

http://www.rmn.fr/musees-allemands/index.html

All my cousin and mother kept saying was, 'the proportions are all wrong...still, it was a long time ago, I'm sure painters have gotten a bit better since then...'

Later that day at the Gare du nord, my mother actually made me take back her Sunday Times because the newsagent's didn't have a particular supplement. I was feeling surly anyway, but this being Paris, the old lady behind the till was not a sweet lady called Mavis. She was a monster. Whereas before I was angry at my mother for making me take back a newspaper, I was now livid at this woman for shouting at me like I was a two-year old. The funny thing is that in French, there is a polite form of speaking, the 'vous' form. This means that all this aggression and rudeness was couched in over-the-top politeness. So even though we'd been shouted at, my mother still ended the conversation with, ""Thou art most kind""."

"event","So on Saturday, my mother and I arrived at my cousin's flat at around midday. My cousin's name is Joelle (a prime example of the French tactic of making a guy's name into a girl's by adding a feminine ending...other women in the family include Paule, Laurence and Claude) and she excitedly babbled to us about her father's plans for having a second Barmitzvah at 83. Apparently a man's life is 70 years according to Jewish tradition, so every year after that you treat as part of a 'new' life (despite the fact that your colostomy bag, and tendency to dribble, suggest your life has never been less new). She also told us that he quipped, 'does this mean I have to have another circumcision too?' Jews are FUNNY... remember? Then she and my mother began to talk about what a great religion Judaism is, and how no other religion has that skill in coming up with great party ideas. 

Audrey (her daughter who's my age) told me her film club was making a short film, so I ran with her across Paris to meet up with her friends. I was expecting a really cool group of cigarette-smoking students who wanted to make some sort of gritty existential love story in a cold apartment. I got the weirdest bunch of sub-Oxford geeks who were making a cross between 'Back to the Future' and 'Dude, Where's My Car?' They were all stood there munching on sandwiches in a circle, sporting a variety of hair-styles (greasy pony-tail, unbelievably huge ginger afro) to go with their glasses. I even heard a tourist mutter in English, 'NOT the best place to be standing' as he barged past. I'm really not familiar with French social rules, so the English gentleman in me tried to shake hands with the only female in the group. She stared at me like I'd just taken a shit in her sandwich. Apparently I should have kissed her...even though she had coleslaw all over her face. No thanks.

Anyway it was a great afternoon. The self-important director actually STOPPED TRAFFIC in order to shoot a scene. They'd hired actors, impossibly beautiful ones, to play the main couple, but the script made them have a cheesy conversation about going on a date. None of that mattered to me: I was with a group of friends in the streets of Paris shooting a film. It's the stuff of dreams. It didn't matter that we were shooting next to a Calvin Klein shop, so all sorts of weird gay couples kept walking past the camera sticking their tongues out suggestively.

We then had to run to my aunt's for Passover dinner, which was also great. The warmth of my family's welcome is entirely dependent on how well you're doing at school. I got shocked silence after I told them my current position, while Audrey got constant congratulation. Claude's husband Albert told his youngest son the story of Passover, which made it seem like everyone round the table had been personally persecuted by a Pharaoh: ""I can still feel the whip's savage bite on my broad shoulders...never again."" After dinner my aunt gave a huge rant about gay marriage, recently sanctioned in Spain, which covered me in spittle. Suitably I went back home with Audrey to watch the 'Spongebob Squarepants Movie', possibly the best film ever at 1am in the morning."

This guy was almost as bad at haircut conversation as I am, mumbling a question to me every 10 minutes: ""What you doing today?"" ""...er, revising. I've got exams."" ""Oh."" [VERY LONG PAUSE] ""So, where are you from?"" Anyway afterwards I told myself not to moan about it because nobody else even notices haircuts anyway. Let's face it, all the simple changes made to our appearance, that we think make all the difference between fuck-ugly and sexy-hot, are barely registered by other people. Contact lenses? Piercings? A big dog collar with spikes on? If your face still looks like it could be on the 'Tesco Managerial Staff' photo board, nothing's going to change that.

It's Passover this weekend, so I'm going to Paris to 'hide the Matzah' (and no, that is not a Semitic equivalent of 'hide the salami'). At least I get to see Becky before then, who's been attempting to sell her house despite the huge guinea pig-shaped damp area and chewed wallpaper. Unless the buyer turns out to be a guinea pig in a pin-striped suit, I can't see it going down well.

Yesterday was a good day for offending Catholics...in the defence of Pope-bashers, we wouldn't do it if the world wasn't sucking the Vatican's cock at the moment. WHY on earth is everyone worshipping the head of the Catholic Church? 'Le Monde' sarcastically noted that France 'woke up feeling very Catholic' on the day of the Pope's death. Ok fine, so Tony Blair's a Catholic in secret, but George Bush!? There's a nasty strain of pan-Christianity going round at the moment, and it's clearly a reaction to the decline in popularity of certain sects, but come on now. I half expected Bush to send in an application for Holy Roman Emperor. GET OVER IT.

I was worried it'd have lots of violin music and close-up shots of Hitler crying while stroking his little cat Liebschen. Instead it was like 'Das Boot', a tight, well-filmed piece of claustrophobic human drama. I saw it with another untermensch who argued that it sympathised too much with Hitler - for crying out loud, you're shown a mother killing her six children for the Nazi cause, that's hardly what I'd call a rallying cry for the good old days of the Third Reich. And I'd much rather see Hitler as a human character (seeing as he was actually a man) instead of some grossly exaggerated demon with red eyes who feasts on Jewish liver (yes yes, I know, even though he was a vegetarian...think you're so clever, don't you). If you ask me it's far more dangerous to suggest that Hitler was a one-off, a crazed tyrant, a 'phew we'll never let another beast like that take power' sort of guy. This film shows us a sad, pathetic old man, who clings to his Darwinism and mythology like it's his favourite blanket.

The actors really looked the part: Goebbels in particular looked like the real thing, he had the most terrifying slithery face ever. And Albert Speer looked disturbingly like a Halifax bank manager, with a lame yellow-stripe tie and business suit. He really could have been called Nigel. Appropriately for a film about tortuous despair, the only seat I was able to grab in the packed cinema was in the front row, two seats from the far right end. My head is still locked in position, staring off into the sky. It was worth it though, I think I've done my bit for Jewish suffering."

"event","I have become seriously addicted to Shariah TV. At 12.10am every weeknight, a band of Muslims come out and host a chat show in order to cover the ground Trisha tends to miss out: Koranic law, Islamophobia and the clash of civilizations. Like with most religions, the elder sages are a calm old bunch, desperately trying to find the answers to modern life in texts written 1300 years ago. Shariah TV introduced me to the REALLY scary Muslims: the recent converts. I find nothing more hilarious than a ginger-haired, pasty-faced, mild-mannered lawyer introducing himself as 'Ahmed Thomson', and whispering 'may Allah preserve him' every time the prophet's name is mentioned. In a lisping accent, he informed everyone that he would love it if Britain became a Muslim state. Another try-hard was a smiling twenty-year old student, probably called Clarabelle, who peeked out from underneath her head-scarf and asked how best to inform someone she wasn't able to shake their hand. The host seemed surprised she didn't shake hands. Her reply was: 'Well, I'm a recent Muslim, but I was led to believe that shaking hands for a woman wasn't the done thing.' Yeah, so much for the prophet's words reverberating through your soul, Clarabelle. Then the imams had a quiet discussion about whether it would be okay for a young lady to shake hands with another man. As with everything, the answer seemed to be a reserved shrug.

And another thing: is the right not to vote as precious as the right to vote? I happen to think that an ignorant vote is more dangerous than an informed abstinence. If people aren't politically educated at school, and their only subsequent interests are derived from tabloids (and I'm sure there is a link there) then I guess the crinkly 19th century Tory in me has to say 'don't bother'. I mean even in the US, a country we often scoff at in terms of political savvy, has 'Citizenship Studies' (I think it's called) in which civic pride and knowledge is instilled into every smiling pair of braces. Obviously republics have more pride about their government, but there's no reason why the citizens of the British Isles shouldn't feel some form of civic pride. Britain has no written constitution, no republican values, an established church and a dormant monarchy. YET it's a haven of multicultural values. I guess apathy does have its upsides, if you like that sort of thing..."

"event","Camden is fucking poser central, I cannot believe that I used to mope up and down Camden High Street envying people who were wearing knee-length bondage boots, as if the Klingon look was shit hot. REAL CORDUROY, that's what you want, for that feeling of being covered in sofa material. Anyway I met Julian to go see 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou', which was...well...a bit unimpressive. Obviously Wes Anderson has a particular style, but I'm pretty sure that 'Rushmore' had at least some emotional sympathy pushing through its self-consciously oddball veneer. The 'Life Aquatic' has nothing of the sort. It's all so harmless and whimsical that any attempt at sincerity or depth just slides ineffectually off the screen. Perhaps that's 'not the point', but then what is the point? It can't be a straight spoof of Jacques Cousteau, because there's nothing TO spoof, apart from the wacky red hat. There aren't even that many jokes. It's a simple adventure story about a submarine crew going after a shark, a la Moby Dick, but one that tries to make the critics ring their bell of originality at every turn by chucking in some computer generated fish, or by having a character who only sings David Bowie songs in Portuguese, or by having a boy in lederhosen run down a pier with the entire cast for absolutely no reason. This means that the 'serious' bits leave the audience confused as to whether they're supposed to laugh or not. I don't believe it's all meant to be 'a joke', I really think we're supposed to feel the emotion when Bill Murray's character bursts into tears at the end, with Sigur Ros playing on the soundtrack and a dumb-looking computer-generated shark in front of him. I had to watch 'Scum' when I got home just for a breath of fresh air. 'OI'M THE DADDY!'"

"event","Hermocrates: Hey Socrates! How are you?

Socrates: Friend, do not be absurd. You are asking a question that cannot be answered so simply.

Hermocrates: Er...ok. Sorry, just wanted to see how you were.

Socrates: Do you not agree that how I am must necessarily be the opposite to how I am not? 

Hermocrates: Look, nobody else has this problem. All you have to do is say you're fine.

Socrates: Perhaps another approach would help you to understand, friend. Do you not agree that the horseman must train his horse? That the fisherman must fish? That the painter's role is to paint?

Hermocrates: I'm beginning to understand why a lot of people want you dead.

Socrates: Of course, friend. I apologise. It must be I who is foolish. 

Hermocrates: Oh no, don't you start with that - 

Socrates: It must be you who is the great philosopher - 

Hermocrates: You ALWAYS do this, you bring out your stupid sarcastic reverse psychology - 

Socrates: I shall be your pupil, Hermocrates! Then you will teach me the valuable thoughts of your philosophy.

Hermocrates: I hate you! I don't even know why I speak to you! I'm just on my way to pick up a pair of sandals and a little boy for the evening, and I see you, and I think 'oh look, there's Socrates! A bit of politeness will make him happy, what with all the legal action against him!' But NO! You're the same old annoying, repetitive, boring bastard you always were.

Socrates: ...if you get me a little boy too I'll shut up."

"event","Amazingly this girl that I do film studies with, Gemma, actually went to school with Becky, which I only found out a couple of days ago. Gemma sent me an email saying how 'lucky' I was to be going out with a 'fabbo gal' like Becky. HELLO? Yet again someone is telling me how lucky I am, but no-one ever tells Becky how lucky she is. All she ever gets is a glance of concern, followed by 'you know, I could set you up with a handsome young lawyer, he's over 30 but I can tell you're not picky...' I guess it's up to me to remind my girlfriend that she's going out with someone who can play 'Smoke On The Water' really well. The whole thing, mind, verse and everything."

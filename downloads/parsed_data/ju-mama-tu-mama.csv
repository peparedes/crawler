"event","Life is seriously a piece of shit... I havent wrote in here in a while cause on April 7, 2005, i met the man i wanted to spend the rest of my life with, and on September 15, 2005 it all went down the drain.  Funny how you think youll be with someone forever.  Right now i cant even think straight.  This is actually the first time i have ever been in love with someone before, and it hurts so bad.  I have been through so much with him, and i kno he loves me just the same.  Ive been crying for almost 8 hours already, i cant think about anything else but him. We get into these pety arguements for no reasons, and i dont know why.  Its basically because hes so far away from me.  Hes in Boston right now,  he had to leave me cuz my parents made it impossible for us to be together. We were getting married and moving in with eachother when i graduated from high school.  But all thats gone now... He said i dont understand him... and i admit it sometimes i dont cause he easily gets upset for everything... but i am so hardheaded and so irresponsible so that gives him a reason to get upset with me.  I havent talked to him since yesterday and im going crazy its like i have a knot in my mouth...I wish i could call him but i know he doesnt want to talk to me and he also told me if i wanted to take some time off and i said no so he said he was gonna take the time off... I just want to be with him the love we have for eachother is so strong that i cant even explain it... Maybe we love eachother too much? i dont know... All i kno is that i miss him, and i just want things to be normal again.. i hate fighting with him , and sometimes i avoid doing things just so he wont get mad.. I cant explain how i feel right now, i am never gonna feel the same way towards anyone else like i did with him.. its unexplainable... People say sometimes you have to let things go and if comes back then it was truly made too be... i just want to be with him i love him so much, and he told me that sometimes he thinks i dont love him and that kills me.. I know hes not gonna call me, because hes just like me, we both have too much pride.  I hate this so much i just want to forget this ever happened and let things go back to the way they were. I cant be with anyone else... but i dont think he wants to be with me anymore... i want to call him so bad i just keep starin at the phone.. me and him have been thru soo much, it came to a point that he came to my house to talk to my parents... and i even sacrificed the relationship with my parents just to be with him. i didnt care about anything else he was my best friend, hes all i fucking had,and now hes gone.. I dont kno what im gonna do anymore... i just want to lock myself up in my room and never come out, i feel like something has been torn out of me.. i feel so bad.  i miss him so much hes all i ever wanted.. people probably think that im crazy or something, but they just dont understand he was the one he was the one i wanted to be with forever, i didnt need anyone else and now its all gone.  When you actually fall in love with someone youll know what im talking about"

"event","Arent birthday's supposed to be fun! and full of happiness?  Then why aren't i feeling that way?  Today was a perfect example of finding out who your true friends are.  Not that i give a rats ass if i have friends or not, because i have just figured out that i only need 4 people in my life and thats my mother, my sister, my father, and my grandmother i dont give a shit about no1 else, no1 else really matters to my anymore.  I used to think my family was out to get me but it finally dawned on me there not and how could i have been so stupid to think that.  There my best friends i have never been this close to my family ever and im so happy i can experience it.  Especially with my sister me and my sister are like best friends I love my family to death and im glad i have them.  Thats why im glad we have birthdays because it actually gives you a chance to realize who your friends are. I dont need any1 i have everything i need and thats my family, and if i ever get a chance to meet a person that i can confide in and i enjoy spending time with them hey thats good too.  Like my ""best friend"" Louis hey doesnt call me and shit im the one that keeps in contact and whatever and im tired of it and im not calling him imma wait to see how long it takes for him to call me back.  Well thats it Happy Birthday to me."

"event","UGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! im so used to having a guy call me left and right.  im not trying to sound conceited but ugh, im so lonely now!!! Okay there was this guy i used to work with him i used have a crush on him and whatever, but i never said anything because he would always talk to me about his girlfriend. But watever timed passed by and i quit and a week later he called me and told me he broke up with his girlfriend that he had had the biggest crush on me since he started working there i told him i liked him too blah blah blah we went out to the movies that saturday and we made out in the movie theatre blah blah blah i was starting to really like him but slowly we jus stopped talking, i go to night school and i kno this girl that knows him and hates his girlfriend becuz everyone in her school dislikes her and watever one of mine and his friend that worked with us too was gonna go down to night school to kick her ass becuz she went to night school wit us i never seen her be4 and watever i called him and told him wat was gonna happen and then i found out that he called his friend CRYING!!!!!!! Telling her not to do anything.  And be4 all of this ever happened i made a bet with him saying he was gonna get back with her, he owes me $20.  Hes in love with that girl after she cheated on him like 5 times. i dont get it. i jus dont like the fact that i feel used.  Well that was bachelor number 1.  Now bachelor number 2 my supposebly boyfriend.  I dont kno why i got back wit him i mean i liked him but not to get back with him, he asked me out the same day his dad died so i guess that had a lot to do with it, i was never gonna get back with him becuz he cheated on me.  But i cheated on him now with 2 guys, damn i feel bad.  But whatever hes weird sometimes hes all into the relationship and other times hes not, i dont care im not even gonna sweat it he transferred anywayz fuck it he doesnt love me anywayz, well now onto bachelor  number 3 well i was molested by this one a  long time ago. And we started talking again me like a retard well watever he got mad at me becuz he wanted me to leave school with him and i said no. So hes not talking to me anymore oh well ill move on.

"event","Oh my god im soooooo mad right now.  Okay let me start from the beginning becuz i havent wrote in this thing in months.  Okay first things first i got a job... yea wooohooo!!! Yea im a waitress at johnny rockets isn't that just dandy... well anywayz with my first two weeks of working there i met this guy named _______, i dont know what i was smoking when i gave him my number honestly i wasn't going to because he was not my type at all.  But whatever everyone was like just give it to him you never kno if hes the one... Well he was the one alright, the real nail in my ass one.  Whatever i'm the type of girl that im influenced by anything, i mean im so gullible ( when it comes to guys ) im just soo stupid and i dont know why.  Anywayz whatever me n him started talking n stuff and i thought i fell in ""love"" with him.  But i really wasnt i was just lonely at the time i jus wanted to be loved by any guy without caring who it was.  i defended this asshole to the very end, even though i knew he didnt a fucking IQ. I put my fucking family on hold for this pussyass bitch.  Its not even his fault its mine for letting him brainwash me.  It came to the point that i didnt want nothing to do with my family, it came to the point that i didnt even like them, for telling me wat to do, because i told my mom that i had a boyfriend and she totally disagreed with it and the only reason why i told her was becuz his fuck ass fucking begged me to he was driving me fucking crazy so that caused for me to have problems with my family.  And he would treat me so fucking bad i mean he would leave these fucking messages in my cell phone, talking about "" where the fuck are you your prolly with some other guy fucking him or something"" what kind of shit is that too say to a girl, and im not even like that who the hell is he to fucking judge me. Hes the one with a fucked up life no1 knows where the fuck his mom and dad is he lives with hes grandmother, he dropped out of high school, he cant get a fucking job and hes always asking me for fucking money, that bitch owes me 60 dollars anywayz.  he ruined my fucking life seriously. But atleast he taught me one fucking thing dont ever let a guy change the way you are just becuz hes a fucking retard dont ever bring urself down to be at there level becuz thats what i did.  All my friends even said why the fuck do u go with him, ur too good for him.  And i dont want to sound conceited but i really am.  I mean it did come to a point that i liked him and whatever but i dont know what the fuck happened i was just caught up in the moment, he has nothing to fucking offer me.  And the type of shit he would say to me he would fucking bitch at me for everything for wearing a skirt to school, for skipping school to go to a hospital to see my friend cuz she got in a car accident, he thought i was gonna leave with some guy, oh my god talk about not trusting your girlfriend.  He never trusted me, he left a message on my phone one day talking about lemme find out ur cheating ill whoop ur ass or sum crazy shyt like that cuz hes sooo fucking dramatic yo, its annoying.  And the funny thing is that i never said anything to him never i always keeped my mouth shut.  He had people fucking watching me and shit, oh my god how annoying.  But whatever im not gonna keep my mouth shut anymore i mean i  dont hate him or anything i just dont want to be with him anymore and that is exactly why im breaking up with him; i been wanted to break up with him but im just scared or whatever, now that i think about it how could i have been sooo stupid. He always claimed i cheated on him, i never did i was soo fucking faithful its not even funny but watever he doesnt have to believe me he can think whatever he wants to think, so thank you ________ for teaching me how to be stronger and not soo fucking stupid when it comes to guys and knowing when not to keep my mouth shut and not letting no fucking guy ever manipulate me ever the fuck again. So thank you, and i dont hate you i really dont i loved you but thats all over i dont need you anymore im better off by myself, have a nice life and thank you for ruining mine; hopefully youll become something in the future; I'll keep you in my prayers becuz u do need Jesus."

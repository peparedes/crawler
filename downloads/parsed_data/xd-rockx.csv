<P>""Oh, come on Dani, quit crying,"" Darryn sighed at the squalling toddler in his arms. He frowned a bit and then bounced her in his arms. </P>
<P>""I dunno what you want, kid."" Dani continued to cry, burying her little face in Darryn's t-shirt. He smoothed her strawberry curls and groaned as he heard something crash in the back of the house. </P>
<P>""Blaine!"" he called, knowing Manny had caused some sort of distruction, before focusing on his niece once more. </P>
<P>""Hey, you want me to sing you a song?"" he asked her quietly as she sniffed into his shoulder. ""Uh... the ants go marching one by one, hurrah... hurrah...""</P>
<P>Tamil looked around the street, glancing at the address scrawled on the back of her hand every so often. She watched streets go by, finally finding the right one and wandering until she found the house that matched the writing on the back of her hand. She looked up at the sky and smirked. </P>
<P>""Finally!"" she sighed, sounding exhausted. She walked up to the door, hearing muffled voices inside. She raised a brow, but knocked despite herself.</P>
<P>""The little one stopped to tie his shoe..."" Darryn sang as he made his way towards the front door. Dani had become slightly more quiet and he opened the door. ""...and they all go marching down to the ground to get out of the rain...""</P>
<P>Tamil stood frozen in the doorway, her hand frozen in front of her face as if she was still going to knock on an imaginary door. She tilted her head to the song and the fact that Darryn was singing, and the small child in his arms.</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Er...bad timing?""> ""Er... bad timing?"" she asked, her brain frozen in pure shock at the scene. She waited for Darryn to step aside, and walked into the house carefully, glancing around suspiciously. Where there was one child.... there were always more.</P>
<P>""Nah... she's sick, I think,"" Darryn frowned, looking down at Dani, who had finally stifled. ""Come in, come in. Make yourself comfortable."" </P>
<P>He gestured towards the couch and looked down the hall, just in time to find Blaine pulling Manny down the arm by his arm. The child had a hand over his mouth to keep from giggling and Blaine scowled at him. </P>
<P>""I... I can't... I don't know... he won't..."" he sputtered and Darryn rolled his eyes. </P>
<P>""Go study, dude, I'll watch him."" </P>
<P>Blaine sighed and then turned around to disappear down the hall. Darryn grabbed the back of Manny's shirt to keep him from following and then tugged him to sit down on the couch next to Tamil. </P>
<P>""Stay,"" he said sternly, and Manny proceeded to pout, crossing his arms over his chest. Tamil glanced at the child, scooting inch by inch to the other end of the couch like Manny carried the most horrible of all diseases imaginable. When she hit the arm of the couch, she moved up onto it, sitting with her knees held under her chin. She swayed slightly, yet dangerously, on her new perch, eyeing the pouting boy in what seemed an inner panic. Manny looked up at her curiously, his curly brown head tilted to one side. Darryn looked between the two and then sat down between them, leaving enough room for Tamil, just in case she fell off the arm of the couch. He turned Dani and sat her in his lap, cradling her with his leg which he crossed over his opposite knee, and she leaned back sleepily against his stomach. Tamil looked between the two children and Darryn, staying on her new perch. When Dani seemed to be asleep, Tamil slid back onto the couch warily, watching her intently at every cloth rustle. When she had finally sunk into the couch she looked at Darryn and gave a half smile.</P>
<P>""I... uh.... not a big kid fan...."" she stumbled around her words, looking back at the girl and still very awake Manny from time to time.</P>
<P>Darryn frowned sympathetically at her. ""In this house, you learn to like them.""</P>
<P>The door opened again, without warning this time, and someone entered. ""Come on, Charlie, hurry up...""</P>
<P>Someone followed the first in, then the tall boy with dark hair started up the stairs after he kicked off his shoes at the door. ""Hey Darryn, Tamil. I'm baby-sitting today -""</P>
<P>Charlie sneered at the term. </P>
<P>""- hope you don't mind,"" he finished as he got to the top of the stairs. Moments after he stepped in the living room, his little brother, nearly a carbon copy in looks but only about 3/4 as tall, stepped up next to him.</P>
<P>""You know Darryn,"" Mike said, ""That's Tamil.""</P>
<P>Charlie didn't say anything, but he crossed his arms over his chest.</P>
<P>""That means hello,"" Mike said for him.</P>
<P>""Hey, C-Man,"" Darryn nodded at him.</P>
<P>""Hey,"" Charlie said shortly, not moving from Mike's side.</P>
<P>""Mom's 'job hunting' again,"" Mike explained as he sat down in a chair. Charlie remained standing, not sure of where to sit as Mike continued. ""But she doesn't trust me with Ben, so he's at the neighbor's - thankfully.""</P>
<P>""Here, Charlie,"" Darryn said, standing up and cradling Dani in his arms and moving to sit down on the floor in front of the couch.</P>
<P>""Thanks,"" he mumbled, feeling Mike's eyes on him.</P>
<P>""So what're we up to today?"" Mike asked, then smiled, watching Manny and Dani. ""Besides baby-sitting?""</P>
<P>""We're having pizza for dinner,"" Manny spoke up, smiling broadly and revealing two missing front teeth. ""Aren't we?"" </P>
<P>He looked to Darryn expectantly. Darryn raised his eyebrows, this clearly being news to him, but he shrugged. ""Er... sure, why not.""</P>
<P>""That's a start,"" Mike nodded. ""We could play cards... Do you guys play cards?""</P>
<P>""No one plays cards out here,"" Charlie said, rolling his eyes at his brother. </P>
<P>Mike didn't acknowledge him directly, but shrugged at Darryn. ""He's still not really settled yet from the move.""</P>
<P>Tamil watched them silently, looking to the grumpy boy now beside her and perching herself back onto the arm of the couch. He was worse than the smaller kids. ""I don't really know what I'm doing, but cards are fine with me."" </P>
<P>""I don't know if we have any cards,"" Darryn frowned. ""We could play Monopoly. Or Trivial Pursuit. We've got lots of board games in that closet over there."" </P>
<P>He gestured to the closet next to the door. ""You can see if there's anything in there.""</P>
<P>""You don't want to play Monopoly with Charlie,"" Mike warned with a smile. ""He's... uh, very competative. We could play Trivial Pursuit.""</P>
<P>""No,"" Charlie said quickly. ""I hate that game.""</P>
<P>""Well, why don't you look and see if there's anything YOU want to play, Charlie,"" Darryn said flatly. As if on cue, Tamil reached over and nudged Charlie off the couch. Mike tried to not laugh as Charlie landed on his feet abruptly. He scowled. </P>
<P>""Fine, I'll -..."" he trailed off as he noticed the small pile of video games near the TV. ""We could play video games.""</P>
<P>""Er..."" Darryn looked at the other two. ""We could play video games?""</P>
<P>""There's at least five of us here, Chas,"" Mike said. ""No.""</P>
<P>*I* could play video games,"" Charlie said, shrugging.</P>
<P>""HE could play video games,"" Darryn repeated, nodding in his direction.</P>
<P>Tamil smirked, and nodded as well. ""Yeah, wouldn't bother me a bit.""</P>
<P>""It'd make things easier for all of us,"" Mike smiled. Charlie crossed his arms over his chest again, watching them expectantly.</P>
<P>""All yours, Chuck,"" Darryn said quickly. He gestured to the Playstation and then made to stand up. He carefully placed Dani in the playpen beside the couch and then looked over at Manny. ""Wanna help me?""</P>
<P>Manny grinned. ""Can I poke the holes?"" </P>
<P>Darryn nodded and Manny jumped off the couch and ran into the kitchen. Darryn gestured for Tamil and Mike to follow and they all moved into the kitchen. Mike followed the group into the kitchen and smacked Charlie lightly on the head as he passed. ""Hey, play nice, all right?""</P>
<P>Charlie rolled his eyes and turned on the TV and Playstation. Tamil got up and walked ahead of Mike as he talked to Charlie. She entered the kitchen, placing Darryn between herself and Manny at all times possible. Darryn pretended not to notice as he took a pan from one of the lower cabinets and set it down on top of the counter. He got out the pizza crust dough that his mom had left in the refridgerator and then set it down next to the pan. He sought out the toppings and dropped them all next to counter as well before proceeding to smooth the dough out onto the pan. When he was finished, he took the pan and a fork over to the table and set them in front of Manny. </P>
<P>""Go wild,"" he said, sinking into the chair next to him. Manny picked up the fork and started stabbing it into the dough.</P>
<P>""How can I help?"" Mike asked.</P>
<P>""I gotta bake the crust first for the pizza, but there's some stuff to make a salad in the fridge if you wanna help with that,"" Darryn shrugged.</P>
<P>""Sure,"" Mike said, helping himself to the now familiar fridge. Tamil leaned back against the counter, watching for a moment before she questioned her presence in the kitchen. </P>
<P>""Anything else you need help with?"" </P>
<P>""You could just stand there and look pretty,"" Darryn suggested with a smirk as he leaned back in his chair, glancing to Manny, who was still poking away at the dough. Tamil cocked her head to the side and let a smirk dance over her face. </P>
<P>""Cute, Darryn... real cute,"" she laughed, looking over at Mike. </P>
<P>""Salad under control?"" she asked, almost pleading for something useful to do.</P>
<P>""Tear lettuce, put it in the bowl,"" Mike shrugged, then smiled. ""I think I've got it. If you're getting bored, you could always go play video games with Charlie.""</P>
<P>""Ooh... there's an idea,"" Darryn grinned, leaning back in his chair to look out of the kitchen. ""Hey, Charlie, mind if Tami joins-""</P>
<P>Tamil sudddenly jumped forward and clasped her hand over Darryn's mouth. </P>
<P>""Don't even finish..."" she growled in his ear. Mike grinned as he watched the two.</P>
<P>""Ah ig oo,"" Darryn laughed into her hand. ""Leh oh.""</P>
<P>Tamil glared at Darryn, waited, then removed her hand. ""What?"" </P>
<P>""I said 'I'll lick you, let go',"" Darryn grinned. ""But you let go, so it wasn't necessary.""</P>
<P>Tamil only smirked. </P>
<P>""I would have wiped it all over your face if you would have,"" she retorted, backing into her counter and leaning against it once more.</P>
<P>""I'm a boy, Tami,"" Darryn replied, turning around in his chair and crossing his arms over the back of it. ""Spit doesn't gross me out. Especially when it's my own spit."" </P>
<P>""I'm done,"" Manny said, tugging on the bottom of Darryn's shirt. Darryn turned and took the fork and pan from him. ""Good job, kid.""</P>
<P>""It would have gotten it off my hand though,"" Tamil said, narrowing her eyes. ""Darryl.""</P>
<P>""So would wiping it off on your pant leg,"" Darryn noted as he crossed the room and put the pan into the oven, turning the knob to the correct temperature. He closed the door, then fiddled with an ugly green egg timer on top of the stove, setting it for 15 minutes.</P>
<P>""But that would just be putting it back on myself. Rubbing it back on your face would be returning it to the rightful owner,"" Tamil smirked.</P>
<P>""But, that's like I'm an Indian giver. I would have given that spit to you,"" Darryn retorted, crossing his arms over his chest. </P>
<P>""Hey, what are you going to put on the pizza?"" Mike interrupted suddenly. ""Should have warned you - Charlie's a picky eater. No peppers, onions, or pepperoni.""</P>
<P>""Uh... we can give him a corner without pepperoni,"" Darryn said, crossing to the fridge. ""We've got cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and banana peppers. There's some olives in here, but I don't know how old they are, and I'm not really willing to find out.""</P>
<P>""Let me smell 'em,"" Mike said. ""I love olives.""</P>
<P>~*~*~</P>
<P>""Rock paper scissors?""</P>
<P>""Darryn, dude, she called it.""</P>
<P>Darryn groaned and scowled at Tamil as she lazily reached for the last slice of pizza.</P>
<P>""I win,"" she said simply. She lifted it to her mouth and took a small bite. ""Mmm...that's goooood pizza.""</P>
<P>She started to take another bite when, much to her surprised, Darryn suddenly lunged at her and was just as suddenly taking a bite out of the other side of the slice. Tamil's eyes went very wide and Mike snorted.</P>
<P>""Hey Tamil, you've got some Darryn on your pizza."" She let go of the pizza and Darryn caught it with a smirk.</P>
<P>""Works every time,"" Darryn grinned and her eyes narrowed at him as she swiftly kicked him in the shin under the table. He jumped, dropping the pizza on the table. ""Ow!""</P>
<P>Tamil quickly swiped the pizza from in front of him, grinning broadly. ""Works every time.""</P>
<P>Mike laughed again and Darryn stared at her, open mouthed. ""You're an evil genius.""</P>
<P>""So I've been told.""</P>
<P>Darryn just stared at her as Mike stretched in his chair, catching sight of the clock. ""Oh man, is it that late?""</P>
<P>Darryn turned around to glance at the clock, which read 9:45. Mike stood up, carrying his plate to the sink. Darryn stood up, following him into the living room, where Charlie was still playing Playstation by himself, a plate holding a half eaten slice of pizza sitting beside him on the carpet in front of the couch.</P>
<P>""Come on, Charlie, we've got to get home,"" Mike said as Darryn stepped up next to Charlie to pick up his plate.</P>
<P>""Just let me beat this level,"" Charlie replied shortly. Mike rolled his eyes.</P>
<P>""Hurry up,"" Mike sighed, pulling the door open and leaning against the frame. Charlie continued to push buttons rapidly, ever once in a while jerking from side to side.</P>
<P>After an exceedingly long explosion appeared on the screen, Charlie finally laid the controller on the floor and pushed himself to his feet. Mike gestured towards the door and Charlie scowled, crossing to the door.</P>
<P>""Night, C-Man,"" Darryn called after him and Charlie ellicited no response as Mike smirked and glanced back over his shoulder, giving Darryn a small wave and followed after his younger brother, pulling the door shut behind him. Darryn shook his head and started back into the kitchen, dumping Charlie's left over pizza into the trash and then moving to put the plate in the sink.</P>
<P>Tamil sat idly in her seat, munching contently on her hard earned pizza and every once and a while making a noise of extreme enjoyment and sliding down in her chair. </P>
<P>""You really missed out on this pizza you know..."" she mumbled as she waved goodbye to Mike and Charlie. Rising to her feet, she walked over to the counter and sat her plate down in the sink. She gave a side glance at Darryn, then smirked. She didn't pause much longer before she pounced at him, gave him a second to recover, then sealed her lips over his and kissed him. It was nothing more than a short peck, but to Tamil it was something special. Never before had she been the one to kiss a boy first. There was just something special about Darryn that she couldn't figure out. When she pulled away from him she flipped her hair back over her shoulder and smirked shyly.</P>
<P>Darryn's eyes blinked open as she stepped back from him, his brow creased slightly in thought. After a moment, he wet his lips, swallowed, then stepped swiftly towards her, brushing her hair back with his hand and resting it on the side of her face as he lowered his head to press his lips to hers, his other hand gripping her arm. After a few moments, he pulled away from the kiss, his eyes remaining closed for a few seconds.</P>
<P>Very slowly, he opened his eyes and stared down at her, chewing thoughtfully on his lower lip. ""Well okay then,"" he said simply, giving a small nod before releasing her and turning back to the sink.</P>
<P>Tamil stood there for a moment before biting her bottom lip and watching him. All she could hear was her heart pounding and the breathe that was caught in her throat. She couldn't help but laugh a little as he turned away awkwardly.</P>
<P>""Suppose I don't need to guess if my move was the right one or not,"" she mused after a few minutes, looking down into the sink. She purposefully bumped Darryn with her hip playfully. ""Move over and I'll help you do dishes,"" she offered, still trying to recover from the awkwardness lingering in the room. She began to run the water and look around for the dish soap before looking back at Darryn. </P>
<P>""If you don't mind me saying so, I was hoping you'd kiss me back,"" she said more quietly, her face flushing as she quickly went back to looking around for dish soap. He smiled, looking down at the dishes as he handed her the bottle from the other side of the sink.</P>"

"event","Despite his best efforts, Darryn McDaniels was not a great student. He tried, but for some reason which he could not fathom, he was never able to make it through the day without falling asleep in one of his classes. Granted, it was not that surprising to those who really knew him, knowing the workload he took on at home, but most people didn't know this about him. They just assumed he was a slacker.
<lj-cut>
On one particular Tuesday afternoon, during his fourth period creative writing class, this never-ending need to snore finally set in as he let his chin drop boredly into his hand. Slowly, his head began to droop.

""McDaniels!""

Darryn's head jerked up quickly and he nearly tipped over in his chair. Rubbing his eyes, he straightened up.

""Er...yeah?""

""I know this might be a difficult concept for you, but would you please pay attention, and try to refrain from sleepwalking through my classroom?"" asked the tall blonde standing in the front of the classroom. She wasn't young, but not old either, in her early fifties at most, and wore a long billowing tartan skirt matched with a solid black t-shirt. On her feet she wore a pair of tan Burkenstock sandals. ""You know...just a thought.""

Darryn frowned and nodded.

""Sorry, Dr. Reed,"" he yawned, trying to stifle it with his fist. ""It won't happen again.""

""Of course not. Now, will you please take out something to write with and begin the assignment?"" With that, she turned on her heel and moved to sit down at her desk. Darryn reached into his pocket and groaned, finding that he had lost his pencil somewhere during the day. Looking around, he leaned forward and tapped the shoulder of the girl in front of him.

""Psst.""

Tamil Nolan had been oblivious to what was going on around her. She was focused on her paper, on the poem of heartache that was spilling over from her pen onto said piece of paper.  Her dark red hair spilled over her shoulders and onto her desk like streams of fresh blood (or at least, that's how she tended to think of it). She simply blew the stray pieces out of her pen's way. Her pale blue/green eyes stayed focused intently...the masterpiece before her was coming together so nicely...she was almost to the punchline....

And then she was tapped. Her pen stopped mid word. She rolled her eyes up to the ceiling, rolling her head to the side and in doing so lead her entire person to shift sideways in her chair. Her firey hair remained in her face, making her dull eyes look vibrant and venomous. 

""What do you want?"" she snapped half-heartedly. Sure, he'd disrupted her latest masterpiece...but there was no possible way he could know the sudden 80 idea pile-up he had just caused in her brain.

Darryn's head tilted to one side curiously, as this girl didn't seem familiar to him. Odd, he thought to himself, since he was quite sure he'd made a point to meet every girl in his grade on the first day of school. 

""You got a pencil I could borrow?""

Tamil tilted her head as well, furrowing her eyebrows a little as she studied his face.

""Yeah, sure..."" 

She reached into her pockets, a soft jingle of house keys emitted from inside before she drew out a pencil and handed it to him. She kept her head tilted, studying him like he was abstract art.

""What are you doing?"" she asked as she tilted her head just a little farther, smirking with a childlike curiousity. Darryn raised and eyebrow as he took the pencil.

""Uh...well, I was thinking I would..."" he looked up at the chalkboard in the front of the room and frowned. ""What are YOU doing?""

Tamil returned her head to normal, turning and glancing at the chalkboard and finding nothing of great interest. She turned back, looking Darryn straight in the eyes.

""Before you found yourself pencil deprived I was writing a poem...and after that I've been wondering if I was just in your line of vision or if you falling asleep like every other day had left a kink in your neck.""

Her smirk remained, maybe even grew a little, but she spun back around in her chair, hair flaring out like wildfire around her as she did so, without giving Darryn much oppertunity to respond. Darryn blinked at this, slightly surprised at the girl's brash attitude, before looking down at the paper that had been set in front of him. He pressed the pencil to it, as if he had been inspired to write something, then set it down again and tapped the girl on the shoulder once more.

Tamil, senseing the teahcers wandering eyes finding her and Darryn more often, had been acting as if she was writing once more. It threw Dr. Reed off, at least for the moment it seemed. She felt another tap on her shoulder and she spun around again, a little faster than the time before. 

""We really have to stop meeting like this you know,"" she said, her smirk now only taking up half of her mouth. Suddenly seeming to find her mass of hair annoying, she pushed it behind her ear with a slight huff, a chunk still falling out and hanging in front of her face.

""Sorry...I just...are you new or something?"" Darryn asked, now looking very confused. ""I mean...you haven't sat here all semester have you? Because if you have...then I'm an ass.""

Tamil tilted her head, mocking him from earlier.

""Whether or not you are has yet to be decided,"" she stated simply, pausing and furrowing her brows again as if contemplating if she should leave him hanging with that answer or throw the groggy boy a bone and actually give him an answer.

""Yeah, I'm new. As shocking as this information seems to be to you."" She smirked again, beginning to spin back around, but stopped mid, turn. She glanced at Dr. Reed, who had seemingly fallen asleep behind her desk, and returned to where she had been just for kicks.

""I knew it!"" Darryn cried, or at least, as well as he could without being noticed. ""You didn't look familiar. And I KNOW a pretty girl when I see one.""

Tamil jerked back a little as the once timid seeming boy burst into a spasm of enthusiasm. She raised a brow at the pretty comment, but smirked just the same.

""You're really one who likes to sugar coat everything first...aren't you?"" She said. She glanced around at the rest of the small class looking at them, the girls pretending not to be too offended, the guys smirking and whispering amongst themselves as if in agreement with Darryn. She rolled her eyes at them and turned back to Darryn.

""So, as flattered as I am I really don't want to be called ""Pretty Girl"" for the rest of my existence. I'm Tamil."" Darryn grinned and held his hand out to her.

""Darryn McDaniels. Welcome to DC.""

Tamil took his hand and gave it one firm shake, then released her grip. 

""Who knew the pencil-less soul behind me would turn into my welcoming commitee. Good thing you didn't need to plan out signs or anything. You'd never of had enough time.""

""I would've,"" Darryn nodded. ""And I'd have brought balloons.""

""Just balloons? No parade or anything? Drat...and I was hoping this town would be exciting."" The smirk turned into a smile and a light laugh, almost perfectly timed with the bell. Dr. Reed jerked up in her seat, blinking, and looked up at the clock.

""Dismissed,"" she said with a wave of her hand. There was a clamber of students rushing towards the door and Darryn stood up quickly, crumpling the paper he'd had on his desk. He picked up the pencil she'd given him as he reached down beside his desk and picked up the black messenger backpack he'd brought with him and then dropped the strap over his shoulder as he held it out to her.

""Uh...so....what do you have fifth period?""

Tamil gathered up her poem and stuffed it into a black trapper that she tucked under her arm. She got up, finding Darryn standing in front of her. She pushed the pencil and his hand back towards him, her pen held in her mouth as she fought to get her keys back into her pocket. 

""Keep it,"" she said through her mouthful, taking the pen out and dropping it into her pocket. It clicked against her keys softly. She stood up, and when Darryn didn't move she walked in front of him and stepped over to the side to let him catch up. 

""Fifth period....that's a good question. I think I have Sociology. Some kind of -ology anyway. Why, what do you have?"" she asked, waiting for him to walk since she didn't exactly know where she was going.

""I have Study Hall that block,"" he said as he shoved her pencil into his pocket and started for the door. ""I have a really easier hour from noon 'til one. Lunch, then study hall.""

Tamil nodded, walking either beside or slightly behind him as he talked. 

""That's got to rock. I'd sleep if I were you."" She followed him out into the hall before she couldn't stand it any longer.

""You just had to go and get me thinking about fifth period, didn't you?"" she said, digging though all her pockets until she found a very rumpled looking piece of paper. She uncrumpled it as best she could, and when she failed at doing so with one hand, she shoved her trapper under Darryn's arm.

""Hey, thank's for volunteering to hold that,"" she joked, then uncrumpled the piece of paper to her specifications as Darryn readjusted the trapper under his arm. She read over it, nodding to herself when she found what she was looking for. 

""Yeah, I do have Sociology. Sounds like so much fun I'll barely be able to stay awake.""

""It's not so bad. Mike likes it,"" Darryn shrugged.

Tamil took her trapper back, nodding her thanks to Darryn, and looked down the hall into the sea of new faces. The two of them continued on down the hallway for a few moments before she broke their silence.

""Who's Mike?""

""Buddy of mine, helped me pass trig. I'm actually going to meet him right now to go to lunch, if you wanna...?"" Darryn gave her a questioning look, as if nervous that he'd overstepped his boundaries. ""Ya know, if you don't have anything else to do.""

Tamil noticed the pause and the look of what she might classify as fear upon asking her to go hang out with him at lunch. She pretended for a second to seem offended...then smirked.

""What else could I have to do? I haven't been here long enough to cause chaos or anything.""   She let a few seconds pass, then leaned over and tapped him with her shoulder. ""And come on, you weren't being shy in class...have hallphobia or something that makes you nervous?""

""What? No...of course not,"" Darryn said quickly, shaking his head. ""Who, me? Never. I don't get nervous. Please.""

He crossed the hall and stopped in front of one of the lockers. Unlocking it, he yanked it open and automatically, his skateboard fell out and started to roll away as he shoved his bag into the locker. Stopping his board with his foot, he leaned over to pick it up, looking up at her.

""So you're coming then?""

Tamil watched the board with some interest, but took the lack of immediate attention to toss her trapper into his locker. 

""Yeah, I'm coming. I haven't got anything better to do, remember?"" She paused for a second. ""Hey, and I'm stashing my stuff in here. I haven't figured out where my locker is yet.""

He stuck the board under his arm, nodding as he slammed the locker closed and locked it.

""Good deal.""

~*~*~

""Dude, seriously,"" Darryn scoffed, rolling his eyes as Mike stared flatly at him over his cheeseburger. ""Luke and Leia were totally into each other.""

""They were brother and sister!"" Mike argued, dropping his sandwich back onto his lunch tray. ""That's just sick.""

""I mean BEFORE that,"" Darryn sighed, shaking his head.

Unbeknowngst to Tamil, this was usual lunchtime conversation for these two, as they sat on the grass under one of the few trees on campus, styrofoam lunch trays from the cafeteria on the ground in front of them. Darryn glanced over at her, eyebrow raised as he nodded at her own tray.

""What do you think? Carlisle's finest.""

Tamil had been watching her food like it would crawl oonto the gground and begin to burrow at any moment. She'd never been a fan of cafeteria food...or of eating at school for that matter. But when Darryn looked at her, she picked up the greasy looking piece of lukewarm pizza and took a bite out of it, nodding in mock approval. When she swallowed, her tongue felt, and was in fact, bathed in oil.

""Just how I like it...flavored heart attack,"" she said as she took another weary bite.

""Now ya know why I didn't get the pizza,"" he notes pointedly, looking down at his own plate, which only held a pile of fries, a peach, and a large chocolate brownie. He picked up his vanilla milkshake and took a large sip of it through his straw. ""Ah...that hit's the spot.""

Mike snorted as he picked up his burger once more and looked over at Tamil.

""Eventually, you'll learn the ins and outs of the Carlisle Cafe. One of the outs...definitely pizza,"" he said, nodding at her plate. He picked up an apple off of his own tray and tossed it to her. ""That shouldn't clog your arteries.""

Tamil reached up almost lazily and caught the apple a few inches from her face.

""Thanks. Glad to know I have someone who cares that I make it to old age."" She smirked, tackling a bite out of the apple and sinking down into the ground a little more. ""Ah, I didn't think health food would ever taste so good.""

She was quiet for a while after that, giving herself and the guys a chance to finish their lunches. ""So, what do you do for entertainment around here anyway?""

The two glanced at each other for a moment, before answering simultaneously.

""Level 4.""

Tamil glances back and forth between the two of them, looking for a sign of joking or some hint...but she found none.

""Sorry, I must have lost the memo they slipped under my door when my rents moved me here....what's Level 4?""

""Parking garage at the mall,"" Darryn shrugged as he finished off his milkshake and then tossed the cup into a nearby trashcan.

amil glanced at the skateboard, then back at Darryn and smiled. 

""Oh, good place to shred, huh?""

She looked over at Mike, to show that he was free to answer to, but focused more on Darryn until she stood up and dumped her entire styrofoam tray along with mostly whole pizza into the trashcan. 

""I never was into skating where I used to live, but I suppose a new town is worth some new experience...mind teaching me sometime?""

""Skateboarding is an art,"" Darryn stated haughtily, holding up his hand. ""It can't be taught.""

She stared flatly at him and he grinned. ""Yeah, we can teach you.""

Tamil nodded, her familiar smirk returning quickly.

""Cool. I suppose that means eventually you'll have to know my number..."" She paused, watching Darryn to see how many different shades of red he might turn. ""But I'm not going to be like most girls and just hand it out...you have to work for it.""

Darryn smirked right back. ""Who says I want it?""

""When don't you want it?"" Mike asked and Darryn scowled at him.

""Dude, shut up.""

Tamil laughed at them, striding back over to them and sitting down again.

""We'll see..."""

<P>""So sine equals opposite over the hypotenuse?""</P>
<P>Mike broke into a wide grin, punching Darryn in the shoulder.</P>
<P>""Exactly. See, I knew you'd get it."" Darryn smirked, proud of himself.</P>
<P>""I might actually pass this test tomorrow, thanks to you,"" Darryn told him as he shut the book and stood up, stretching as he walked to the freezer and pulled the door open.</P>
<P>""Glad to know I'm good for something,"" Mike laughed, leaning back in his kitchen chair. </P>
<P>""I think this calls for some ice cr-"" He stopped when he heard the front door open and he looked out the door into the living room as Mike leaned back in his chair to see. Darryn's mother walked in, wearing her seafoam green waitressing outfit. She pulled off her shoes and dropped them by the door before walking into the kitchen. </P>
<P>""Hey Ma,"" Darryn smiled as he pulled a pint of cookie dough ice cream out of the freezer. His mom smiled weakly at him and stood on her tip toes to kiss him on the cheek.</P>
<P>""Hi Sweetie.""<BR><BR>""Long night?""<BR><BR>""Wasn't too bad."" She yawned loudly and turned to the table. She stared at Mike, who smiled.</P>
<P>""Who's this?"" she asked, turning back to Darryn.</P>
<P>""Mike Ferris,"" Mike answered for him, getting to his feet and holding out his hand to her. ""Nice to meet you, Mrs. McDaniels."" She smiled and shook his hand.</P>
<P>""Please, call me Laurel.""</P>
<P>""This is the guy who's gonna help me pass trig,"" Darryn told her, opening a drawer and getting out a couple of spoons. Laurel raised an eyebrow.</P>
<P>""Is he now? Well, I suppose it's comforting to know you've taken the iniative to find yourself a tutor."" She yawned again. ""Alright, I'm going to bed. I can hardly keep my eyes open."" Darryn turned to hug her and she smiled at him, patting him on the cheek. ""You know, you look more and more like your father every day."" She sighed and turned back to Mike.</P>
<P>""Good meeting you,"" she told him, patting him on the arm. ""You're welcome to come back whenever you want.""</P>
<P>""Thanks, Mrs. McDaniels.""<BR><BR>""Laurel.""<BR><BR>""Sorry. Thanks, Laurel.""</P>
<P>Darryn's mom nodded and then walked out of the room and disappeared down the hall. Darryn watched her walk away, smiling sadly. Mike stood there, looking slightly uncomfortable until Darryn sighed and turned to him.<BR><BR>""So, you want some of this ice cream?""</P>
<P>""No thanks. I really ought to get home. Charlie's there by himself with Mom.""</P>
<P>""And I take it this is a bad thing."" Mike frowned and nodded. ""Ah, well, maybe next time then."" Mike started into the living room and Darryn followed him, ice cream in hand.</P>
<P>""Well man, this was fun,"" Mike said, picking up his jacket from the couch. ""I'll see ya in class tomorrow."" Darryn nodded as he swallowed a bite of his ice cream and Mike opened the door, waving as he stepped out onto the stoop.<BR><BR>""Thanks for the help!"" Darryn called after him with a mouth full of ice cream as he stepped up to the door.</P>
<P>""Welcome."" Darryn waited for Mike to disappear around the corner, before shutting the door and walking back into the kitchen and sitting down with his ice cream. He sat there thinking for a while until Blaine stepped into the room, wearing only a pair of baggy sweat pants. His hair, which was always pretty messy was even more so than usual.</P>
<P>""Hey Darryn?"" he asked and Darryn looked up. <BR><BR>""Yeah?"" Blaine stepped further into the room and took a seat beside Darryn at the table. Darryn handed his brother a spoon, holding the ice cream out to him.</P>
<P>""I've been thinking about something.""</P>
<P>""That's never good.""<BR><BR>""Shut up, Darryn, I'm serious.""</P>
<P>""Sorry."" Darryn put on his best serious expression. ""Continue.""</P>
<P>""Well...it's just that...I come home every day, right after school, and I watch Manny when Ma goes to work, until you get home."" Blaine sighed.</P>
<P>""Uh huh."" Darryn raised an eyebrow.</P>
<P>""And then Terese is never around, even though they're her kid.""</P>
<P>Darryn frowned and nodded. ""I know, but you can't blame them for it.""</P>
<P>""I don't. But I just don't think it's fair that you and Ma and I have to take care of her kids, when she's never even around. And why doesn't Charlotte have to come home and help?"" Blaine finished pittifully. Darryn laughed.</P>
<P>""Well, no offense, but do you really think THAT would be a good idea?"" Darryn asked. Blaine shrugged.</P>
<P>""I don't know. It's just so dumb."" Blaine took a bite of the ice cream. ""Terese should have never-""</P>
<P>He was cut off when the door swung open and some one practically crawled through the doorway, her dark hair greasy and hanging in front of her face. Blaine looked to Darryn, who groaned.<BR><BR>""Speak of the devil..."" Darryn stood up and walked into the living room, kneeling beside his sister. He placed a hand on her shoulder and she jerked away from him, falling back against the wall.</P>
<P>""Don't touch me,"" Terese snapped. ""I'm fine.""</P>
<P>""Of course. I always crawl through the doorway when I'm fine,"" Darryn muttered, rolling his eyes. Terese glared at him with blood shot eyes from behind her stringy hair. </P>
<P>""You don't know anything about me,"" she spat at him. ""You've never tried to understand me.""</P>
<P>""I understand that you've all but abandoned your children, and that you go out and get yourself plastered every night to try to escape the hell hole you've made out of your life,"" Darryn thought to himself, shaking his head. Despite her protests, he got her up off of the floor and hoisted her into his arms, standing up. Blaine watched him, frowning.<BR><BR>""Open her door, kid,"" Darryn told him, gesturing towards it with his head. Blaine nodded and hurried to open it, stepping back so Darryn could carry her in and put her delicately (moreso than Blaine personally believed she deserved) on her bed, turning her onto her side. He crossed the room and placed the trash can beside her bed, before looking down at her and shaking his head. He looked up to see Blaine watching him from the doorway and he stepped towards him, shutting the door behind himself. He placed a hand on Blaine's shoulder.</P>
<P>""Things like that are why we shouldn't complain about taking care of them. They've got it a lot worse than we do."" Blaine nodded mutely and Darryn squeezed his shoulder before letting go and starting back towards the kitchen. ""Hey Blaine?""<BR><BR>""Yeah?""<BR><BR>""Probably shouldn't tell Ma about this."" Blaine nodded again before disappearing into the darkness of the bedroom he shared with Darryn. Darryn watched him go, before walking back into the kitchen and sitting down at the table. He picked up his spoon, before dropping it back onto the table and leaning forward, placing his head in his hands.</P></FONT>"

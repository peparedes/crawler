"event","Okay, so I found my old Live Journal, which was sad and abandoned for a long time.

Updates - I'm living in a transitional housing situation where I ended up after a long and arduous mental health battle.&nbsp; I have a different boyfriend now than when I wrote in here a year ago.&nbsp; His name is Chris, and he's wonderful.&nbsp; I'm trying to go back to school this fall on short notice so that I can get my Special Educator's Credential.&nbsp; This week I will ask my conservator (for I'm under county conservatorship) whether I can get funds released to go to school in time to meet the deadline.&nbsp; I'm excited and nervous at the same time, hence the trouble sleeping which lead me to seek out Live Journal past my usual bed time.

That is all.&nbsp;"

"event","I went the whole day without realizing it was Father's Day today.&nbsp; Every other year, I've had a breakdown around this time and/or around April 5th, my father's birthday.&nbsp; The reason is that there's a aniversery effect even years later after a loved one passes on, and especially in my dad's case, because he was such a pivotal figure in my life.&nbsp; <br /><br />I might regret slightly not going to church this week, but he didn't like my church anyway.&nbsp; He thought it wasn't a real religion since we had no core beliefs.&nbsp; That's just as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just started thinking about him randomly a few minutes ago, like I often do, even without remembering it was Father's Day.&nbsp; One MySpace bulletin reminded me, and then I realized I thought of him right at the right time.&nbsp; I do it anyway so it's not like it's fortuitous, but it's good to remember.<br /><br />I want to be a better person so that just in case Heaven really is a <i>place</i> and not a state of mind, I can go there and see him again.&nbsp; He's always there anyway because I dream of him often.&nbsp; He always tells me he's still alive but I'm the only one who can see him.&nbsp; He is still alive and helping me and leading me to do good things.&nbsp; Even when I do bad things, he doesn't get as angry as he did in life.&nbsp; He had a very harsh temper, and there was no crossing him when he had his mind set to something.&nbsp; Most of my mother's family could not get along with him, and so we were alienated from them during his life.&nbsp; I visited my cousins occasionally, and I saw my grandfather once in a blue moon, but not too often considering we only lived three hours away.&nbsp; Life happens that way, and there's no stopping it, I suppose.&nbsp; <br /><br />Time does not heal all wounds, but all wounds don't need to be healed.<br /><br />[edit] Here's a link to a website devoted to celebrating holidays one day at a time, today featuring <a href=""http://blog.holidays.net/index.php/2007/06/17/june-17-today-were-celebrating-fathers-day/"">Father's Day</a>."

So here's a simple list:

Cleaning my house.

1. Put all dirty clothes in one or more hampers/bags.&nbsp; Set in one spot together until laundry machines are vacant for my own use.
2. Do the dishes.
3. Clean the counters.
4. Sweep the floor.
5. Mop the floor.
6. Take out the trash.
7. Take out any recycling.
8. Empy the vacuum.
9. Vacuum the bedroom and livingroom rugs.
10. Clean the bathroom.

I'll see how far I get before I get lazy (or don't)."

1. I have a boyfriend in New York whom I never see.&nbsp; He may move out here soon, for real, and then it would be a more real life relationship.&nbsp; Time will only tell.&nbsp; 

What I need advice with is the extent I should be wrapped up in things with him.&nbsp; Right now, I even have my cell phone attached to his.&nbsp; We have separate minutes but are connected.&nbsp; It's a bit weird.&nbsp; In any event, I feel like we've crossed some lines most people would recognize from a casual relationship to seriousness although we've only been around each other in person once.&nbsp; 

I have known him for five years, going on six.... 

I know the decision is my own, but I want an outiside opinion to know if what I'm doing is crazy....

2. How can I stop self destructive behavior, namely binging and sleeping all day and crap like that?&nbsp; I hate myself when I do it and love myself when I don't, yet I do it anyway..&nbsp; Why?!

3.&nbsp; How come I keep making resolutions to change my life but never DO IT??"

At first, I was worried that I would get dependent on this ""structure living"" environment so that I would not learn the basics of taking care of myself.&nbsp; Finally, I've decided that even with this plan, there are ways that I can be responsible for myself.&nbsp; I can start small if I have to and work up.&nbsp; I can take on little responsiblities, little by little.&nbsp; Slowly but surely, I hope to get used to an organized and clean environment where my medication is consistent and my daily routine has some consistency as well.&nbsp; Once that happens, I might actually pull some of the loose ends together that have been hanging out there for a long time.&nbsp; I need to get a copy of my birth certificate and social security card and finally get a new copy of my state ID.&nbsp; Once all that happens, I can begin seriously considering if I want a job, if I want to continue with school or what.&nbsp; 

Another thing I need to make sure of is that I stay in charge of my own life.&nbsp; Despite the fact that others are helping me, I should still be the one to make decisions for myself.&nbsp; As a friend told me, if I hit a brick wall at 60 mph, I want to be the reason I did."

Later in my life I would keep getting injured.&nbsp; I got a large door slammed against my head, but I was fine.&nbsp; I barely cried.&nbsp; I barely cried according to my parents except just to communicate.&nbsp; They tried to give me soy or rice milk at one point, but I didn't take to that until I was already weaned.&nbsp; Besides, I weaned much later than most children.

I won't go on and embarrass myself pointing out my strangeness.&nbsp; Let's just say there's been probably no single event in my life that occurred the same way as everyone else experiences it.&nbsp; I don't suppose that will ever change."

"event","I always dream about him, even to this day.  It has been at least four, maybe five years since his demise, and it is still as fresh in my memory as the day it happened.  For a long while, my memory had dismissed all events prior to his death.  I believe I walled it all off to avoid the pain of the many times that I fell crying while my parents fought.  I had no room of my own, so I witnessed it all, and eventually I ended up counseling them with the very tools that my father had invented in his own philosophy, which he dubbed with the title of Modern Aspectivism.

In my dream, he had very long hair, past his waste.  He had the same beard that he had in real life but longer as well.  Later, he appeared to have shaved clean, cut his hair and donned a suit and tie.  The only strange thing was that his tie was on backwards and hung from his back.  I never once saw my father when he was clean shaven.  All my life he had his beard, so this dream seems a bit peculiar.

In all of my dreams about my father, he appears to be alive as he ever was and saying that either he is still alive and everyone else but me doesn't  know it or that he is alive and will appear although everyone believes he is dead.  Either is a second coming of sorts or he just feigned death to get people's attention.

Of course, I know for a fact that he did die.  I saw his dead corpse myself that night, and it was white as a ghost.  They had not put the sheet over him then, and it was the scariest, saddest thing I had ever witnessed.  That night I didn't cry, and I don't believe I have ever outright cried over his death.  I was partially in shock and partially heavily medicated.  I exclaimed monotonously, ""Dead dad, dead dad, dead dad.""  I was also angry at him for leaving me when I had just left the hospital, the very one that I had to visit when he died.  He hated hospitals, and it is a shame that he had to die in one, because according to my mother, he may not have been completely dead when she found him on the floor.

I cannot imagine how my mother can live in that house with the memory of where he died haunting her night and day.  He died where my own bed used to be, and whenever I sit on the couch that now occupies that space, I cannot help but think about it.  That was also where my bed was, and sometimes when I used to have trouble sleeping, I would go there.  It was comforting somehow.

Maybe it has something to do with Father's Day rolling around again.  You would think I might have gotten over all of that, but no, I suppose I never truly will."

"event","I'm probably the most disorganized person I know.&nbsp; Recently, I've lost my house keys (still haven't found them, but I'm using my spare key), left my cell phone at the OE on campus (but it was found and I'm getting it soon), almost left my laptop on the bust (flagged down the bus driver, who said they were considering selling, joking), either lost or got stolen about $80 from purse, and that's not all.&nbsp; I think I'm going crazy over this stuff.&nbsp; Oh, and I lost my bus pass, so now I have to pay $2 every time I take the bus.&nbsp; That might seem like not that much, but it sure adds up when it's your only mode of transit.&nbsp; 

I've recently been commiting to following an almost vegan diet.&nbsp; I still eat honey sometimes, and I have had some transgresions, such as eating some swiss cheese when they put it in my sandwich and even eating some cheese pizza.&nbsp; I'm gradually trying to cut that stuff out and go back to basics.&nbsp; After I get all that down, I plan to go back to my once healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; I'm going to cut out soda altogether, even my beloved rootbeer.&nbsp; 

Then today I got a haircut.&nbsp; They parted my hair on the left side instead of straight down the center.&nbsp; I'm going to see if I can actually live with that.&nbsp; Whenever they've done that in the past, I've always combed back, but I'll see what I can do.&nbsp; 

I had Mother's Day with my mom last weekend too.&nbsp; It turned out to be pretty easy taking the bus out to Carmel Valley.&nbsp; I used to do it all the time coming home from work in Marina, but I forgot about it.

"event","I've been going along trying to salvage what I can out of my little attempt here at CSUMB, and in the middle of it all, I had a conversation with the professor whose class I've had to unfortunately withdraw from.&nbsp; Her own background is in educational psychology, and I had thought that was the same as school psychology, which was something I had researched previously but had decided wasn't for me.&nbsp; She told me it was actually different and more on the theoretical side of things, which was how this conversation came up.&nbsp; She had to go and help another student, but she said we could always continue the conversation later on.&nbsp; 

I started looking around online and couldn't find much since most of it seemed to intermingle it with careers in school psychology, which is not exactly what I have in mind.&nbsp; I must admit I'm not exactly sure what it is I have in mind, so I'm sure that doesn't help in searching around either.&nbsp; In any event, I did come across one program at the University of Albany that seems more along the lines of what I'm thinking about, basically educational psychology research.&nbsp; I e-mailed the person it said to contact if you had any questions, and I suppose if I get anything back that would be the first step in finding out anything about this at alll.&nbsp; At this point, I feel like any redirection is kind of like a stab in the dark.&nbsp; 

I started in the direction of Special Education not knowing exactly if it would be my cup of tea to start with.&nbsp; When I was at Santa Cruz, I went back and forth over many different options.&nbsp; The education department there was so limited and mostly just focused on basic single-subject or multiple-subject teaching that I couldn't get much information on anything else while I was there.&nbsp; They basically pushed me into the Special Education route, telling me how there was such a high demand and all the rest.&nbsp; I felt like it was a good choice, but I didn't know much about the field even back then.&nbsp; I started hanging out online in this little chatroom for people with ADD/ADHD and I felt comfortable with these people, but I'm not sure that's a clear indication that the field is best for me.

I'm meeting again with my advisor this afternoon and I suppose I'll work something out with him regarding the more immediate questions of how to finish up everything for this and last semester, and then, as he said earlier, I can figure out what direction I really would like to take.

Norma (my therapist) also is trying to get me to become more organized in terms of finances and personal organization in general.&nbsp; I suppose that will all have to be in order before I take any more big moves in any direction.&nbsp; I don't want to take a jump and then fall flat on my face again."

"event","I was late to my appointment at 3:00 yesterday and then totally missed the one at 5:30 because although I sat waiting at the bus stop, it did not come with enough time to get there.  When it finally got there, I made an attempt to get there within reasonable time although still late.  When I got to the Edgewater Transit Exchange in Sand City, I got on the 16 bus that was supposed to go Fort Ord and then Marina.  This particular route was not going that direction until after going back to Monterey.  I got on there anyway feeling thoroughly frustrated and when I got back to the Monterey Transit Plaza, I just got on the number 10 bus that stops right outside my house.  I forgot about that last appointment and decided to reschedule because there was no way I was going to be on time.  Oh well.

Today I went up to campus after finding that I was once again out of money and slightly overdrawn. I'm not out of food or anything, but I need to figure out I'm going to get around.  Today I got money from people around, and that worked but I'm not sure I can do that every time.  Someone still owes me some money and I'm not sure they were ever intended to repay me but I sent them a message asking for at least a little.  Just ten or 20 would be enough to tide me over.  Oh well.  I'll survive.  I'll just get a couple dollars from a neighbor maybe.  I'll survive.  I always have."

"event","I went to see my pdoc about a half hour ago. I'm still out but at the Plumes coffee house downtown.  We were trying to decide if I should stay on my current regime of Seroquel and Lamictal and the pros and cons.  The nurse practitioner that I saw said that the reason they don't want to switch me back to the Abilify or Geodon is that the side effects are too difficult to work with.  Abilify causes akisthesia, which is an involuntary movement and twitching that is very annoying.  Actually, both of those drugs cause that side effect.  The Geodon also disrupted my sleep pattern to the point that in one situation, I actually fell asleep when I got to my placement at Monarch Charter Elementary (in Santa Cruz) one day.  They thought I was on illicit drugs, and I messed up by telling them my diagnosis, which was incorrect then and much more scary.  Bad times.  Bad, bad, bad.

Okay, I must go before I'm late.  

I'll be back after this and probably after I have my appointment with Dr. Irene this evening at 5:30.

"event","Your spell that mistifies everything I know about myself
tends to pull the strands of my heart ever closer
to the brink of madness and
self destruction.

Your bending maze befits the emotion 
overcoming my senses and dragging me 'round
endlessly taunting, dragging me on
down the darkest road yet to be found.

Your guileless selfishness teaches me how
self preservation must begin right now,
for I can't live without you
yet I can't live with me
forgetting about all that I ever could be.

Your pitiful pretense of caring compassion
fades in the shadows that used to cover your intentions
so that beyond a doubt, I know the sound
of facing the truth when you're not around."

Tolkien wrote this book as an amusement for his own children and then it became a big hit.&nbsp; He originally wrote <i>The Silmarillion</i> that did not get published until after his demise.&nbsp; I'm planning now to read <i>The Hobbit</i> and then all three of <i>The Lord of the Rings </i>and then <i>The Silmarillion</i> and finally finish the only books I haven't read yet -- <i>The History of Middle Earth</i>, <i>The Lost Tales</i> and <i>The Unfinished Tales</i>.&nbsp; By then, I should be almost a Tolkien expert although not quite as impressive as those I've found who actually understand some of the Elvish languages invented by Tolkien.&nbsp; Of course, being that Tolkien was a linguist, these are possibly the most profound and important parts of the whole thing.<br /><br />Right now, however, before I get to such fun and interesting things, I must prevail.&nbsp; I must prevail over my p- p- p- procrastination and in the end live to fight another day!

"event","In place of my fears
my heart fills with tears
Through the sadness and the madness
my anger quietly cheers
while the masses murmer sweetly
all the troubles that have been brought
and the rivers wander wildy
though they've never had to be taught

Why can I never see
what never happened to me?
Why can I never feel
the reason that you are real?
Why can I not believe
everything I see in front of me?

What's wrong with love today?
When did we go astray?

I miss the wondering of a child.
I miss the misty mountains wild.
I miss the caring not the staring 
when we used to be so daring.

I wonder else I have missed.
Who was it that you kissed?
Why can't I hear the sound
of a hundred years around
in which we've never met
something we won't regret
and never ever forget
to appreciate the rest?

I always write these weird-ass poems that sound all smooth and meaningful, but they really mean nothing."

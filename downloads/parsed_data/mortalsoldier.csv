"event","<!--StartFragment -->&nbsp;I have ants in my bathroom. They're in the walls I think. I've been fighting a losing war with them... and today it took a turn for the worse. I've been spraying the bathroom with Raid. Today I went in there and there was a giant ant. Like the god ant. I drowned him in Raid. A couple hours later I went in there and he was still alive.

I've created a race of mutant ants immune to Raid.

When I think about the future, I think of mutant ants.

Mutant ants and boarded up malls. Shit scattered everywhere.&nbsp; Nothing new ever being made again.

I wish."

"event","Jen moved out today.  It's been a long time coming, and I know it's NEEDED to happen.  Doesn't mean I was really prepared for it.  I think I'm glad it happened though.  Maybe we both were holding eachother back.

I know some of you hated her and made judgements... but you didn't know her.  It wasn't a one-sided thing.  I was just as guilty in this whole mess.

""When we sleep at night--when we walk across a field and see a tree full of sleeping birds--when we tell small lies to our friends--when we make love--what acts of surgery are happening to our souls--what damage and healing and shock are we going through that we will never be able to fathom?  What films are generated that will <i>never</i> be shown?"""

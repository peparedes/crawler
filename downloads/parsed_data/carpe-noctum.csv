"event","This journal is no longer mine.  I don't feel free to write exactly what I want anymore, because there are too many people that I am afraid of offending.  And when you have to censor your own journal, there's something fucked up in the world.  I'm tired of hearing about my life from other people...other people who happened to have read/talked to someone who has found out all they need to know about me from the internet.  
So on that note...I'm starting something new and beautiful.  If you're special, then you get to read it...otherwise
fuck off
I'll keep my friends list so that all the nosy assholes in the world can comment on my life just as easily as they always have.  Just so long as they don't give the address to any of my ex girlfriends/friends that might be interested in finding out more about me than they need to know.
Thank you very much"

"event","Ana,
When did you become such a crack whore?...and also hot.

Brad,
Why don't you call me back?  I'm sorry that I ditched you that night.  It was Cara's fault, I swear.

Cara,
If there was ever a time that I needed my best friend...It has been these past few weeks.  Thank you for never being there when I needed you and thank you for making me see that you can not trust anyone and you can depend on noone but yourself.  

Chad,
You are a good guy, but too high maintenance for me.  Why oh why can't you wait till I call you...just once?

Christina A.,
I told you I wouldn't forget to mention you

Christina B.,
You're a straight bitch, and I give up on being friends with you.

Dad,
Thank you for everything that you have done lately.  And thank you for being here at night when I'm alone and sad to play Resident Evil with me and make me laugh at your corny jokes.

Farah, 
You are being terribly fickle.  Please tell me how you feel.

Jason,
I am going to be good from now on.  So, no more ""stealing"" me away and no more talk of cheating on your girlfriend.  I won't have any part of it, despite the fact that I like you and that she is a raging bitch.

Jessica (the one that I love),
You are wonderful and thank you for being there every time I've needed someone.  You're probably one of the best friends I have ever had.

Jessica (the one that wants to have all the sex with me),
I'm sorry that I can't come see you.  You have a girlfriend...and I am being good.  I am trying SO very hard to be good.  Resisting hot girls and whatnot. 

Kevin,
Give me a God damn job.

Laura,
Remember when we used to drink together all the time?  Remember how much fun we had?  Remember how long ago that was? Remember how much I fucked up my life?  Do you remember that?  Then, you should hand over that bottle of Jack that you keep under the bed.

Luciana,
Why all the pretenses?  If you hate me, hate me.  If you like me, like me.  Stop fucking with my head.

Mom,
Please don't take my sister away to Michigan to live with your internet boyfriend.

Monica,
You suck.

Nat,
I miss you.

Rachel,
You've grown up a lot and I can enjoy spending time with you.  I hope you don't have to move to Michigan...to live with the boyfriend...that would make me cry, I think.

S*r*h,
I will never spell your name without stars.  You are a beautiful person and I hope that you are happy with your life without Scott.  He never deserved you in the first place

Sprint,
Wher's my new fucking phone?

Staffanie,
Text messaging is fun...but I still miss you.

Steph,
I wonder how you're doing.

Tosha, 
Be wary of Courtney, she seems dangerous.

Crystal,
I'm sorry that I got mad at you last night, but I don't want your lectures.  You can keep them to yourself.  And if you wish to continue this friendship, you're going to have to stop insulting the people that matter to me.  You've always been spiteful to my friends, and I won't put up with it.  I love you and you mean the world to me.  I hope we can work this out."

Everything hurts.
I'm so very tired of everyone calling me and telling me that I sound terrible.  If I hear it one more time, I'm just going to hang up.  So I sound terrible...why do you have to point that out?
I have an appointment with Dr. whatsherface on Thursday...but not for the sickness.  For all the blood. Joy's funeral and Chad's birthday are tomorrow.  Isn't that odd.
Joy's the one who gave me the book, ""the way things work"", which unknowingly teaches you how to pick locks.  Its a great book.
I had the craziest dream last night...It was about Cara and Jason of all people.
My father said that at the mall he saw like 10 girls check me out...strange...considering that my father doesn't know about me.
everything hurts...this sucks

"event","This morning before I went to sleep, I lied on my side for an hour or so, staring at the sun shining down on the picture outside my window.  The world was so beautiful. It was as if I were looking at a painting, and I wanted so much to be there.  I wanted to get up and run out the door, into the morning...and feel the grass on my feet and the sun on my face.  I wanted to spin around in circles, and climb trees, and laugh and play and be happy that I was alive.
But I couldn't move.
All I could do was watch the sun getting brighter and brighter as I fought to keep my eyes open and my face toward this detached and unattainable beauty.  And when I finally gave in to the darkness it was nearly 8 o'clock.  I didn't open my eyes again until 3 hrs after I woke up.  I was too afraid to accept the fact that I had a whole new day ahead of me.
It wasn't as if the day was really all that bad.  I just fear that I won't be able to plan out enough to take up all 24 hrs, and I will be left with free time.  The free time is the worst.  I can't handle my thoughts when they are unadulterated by outside stimuli.  Its like drinking Everclear instead of Vodka.  I just can't take it.

I spent today with my dad and my sister at the mall.  I got a purse/backpack thing, and some earrings...it was fun to hang with my dad again.  Its been a long time.  
I went to Cara's to give her her 20 bucks...and to see if I would still miss her enough to give up my pride...I didn't.  Thank God.
I cried a lot today, for the camera.  I can turn it on and off like a faucet...I surprised myself at how much emotion I could fake for the sake of a few good pictures.  A couple seconds and I had myself sobbing and nearly hyperventilating.  It took less than a minute to turn it off and be angry that the flash wasn't working properly.
I guess that's it.
My uninteresting narrative is over and you're free to go on with your business."

This is very lonely
I won't pick up the phone
and I'll be sleeping alone tonight

All of my muscles hurt.  Why?
Christina hates me...the audacity of that girl!
I was a bitch today
Chad looked like the Uni Bomber 
Christina and Ana were being shiesty tonight...and Jason kept sneaking me off to make out with him.  I swear I'm going to try to be better...I'm trying really hard.

People who are happier when they do drugs:
Are, all of thier lives, searching for something better...something higher.  They spend so much time looking to the future and basking in the anticipation, that they cannot enjoy thier life for what it is.  When they are high/rollin'/skitzin'/drunk/etc., they are living in the moment, because it is the moment that they are meant to experience.  They look deeper into themselves and care nothing for the future...because the future holds sobriety alone.  So what comes of this living in the moment?  Happiness...a sense of happiness that they do not find in everyday life.  It is hard for them to push apart the blinders of reality.  But when they are on the drug...things are different.
Drugs are not preparation for anything.  They are there to give you a singular experience that you enjoy ""in the now"".  If only these people could learn to live life one day at a time.
***I need to learn to live life one day at a time***

I am afraid to go to sleep.
I am afraid that I will have to open my eyes in the morning
I am afraid of a new day that I have to fill with plans, fake laughter and a lot of pretending...a lot of fooling myself.
I know that by the book I've got a thousand reasons to wake up tomorrow...
but none of them seem worth the effort.  It just seems that I'm floating in limbo.
There is humor...there is sadness...and there is utter apathy
It feels like a curse to know that there is a whole nother day ahead of me...and a day after that...and another after that.
I guess I really just don't see the point.
I have;
brains
strength
people falling at my feet
great friends
a loving family
a shot at a future
and talent
But none of it means anything anymore.  The world is not black...it is grey
so grey. 
and everything is too bright...and I'm losing my grip
Its beginning to show
I am slipping so far.  I am ruining my life.  I am crucifying myself.
and what then?
I couldn't kill myself....so what then?
What happens when I lose the last of what I have, because I can't pull myself together?

I just can't bring myself to care.
As long as I stay awake, tomorrow doesn't exist.

and I hate wallowing in depression, but when you're this far on the ground, that's about the most movement you can muster.
I feel so stupid for this
at least I can still feel that.
I'm fighting, but I'm slowly giving in.  I'm sinking and I don't know if its too late to pull me out.
Please pull me out
I am so afraid
I have never been so afraid."

So, I propose that this is a statement taken out of context and adopted incorrectly as a colloquialism.  
I believe that the ends do, in fact, justify the means, but not in the sense that you can justify your actions, making them any less immoral than they are in reality.
My theory is similar to that of the existential idea of karma.

Shoes got muddy and my click turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth, brush naps and comb streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for ACTION!
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin all that got damn noise, man"

and yet we're hiding in the backyard and freezing our asses off.

I stopped taking the medicine because it was making me suicidal and that's something I've never been before...please lets hope its just the drugs...
I want the Zoloft back because it keeps me from getting cold and makes me wake up real early in the morning (whatthefuck I don't know)

What kind of statistics are those?

I sold a teener to my dad...he said he'd help me get rid of it...I hope he does, because it's half BC powder...
and would probably only cure a headache

So, last night we were driving down I-20 in the crazy ice when I began to think, ""Hm...maybe Farah was right.  Maybe this wreck is worse than we thought.""
Cars were stopped from Beltline all the way back to Carrier and nobody was going anywhere.  So I sat...and I sat...and I talked to Kristen on my father's cell phone for an hour...then I picked up some ice from outside and threw it at the people walking around on the highway...this was entertaining for awhile...'till I decided to join them.  It was fun until I almost fell on my ass in front of a rather large line of cars...so I got back in and bitched about the backup...
*waitwaitwaitwaitwait*
Out of nowhere comes a scary Mexican guy in a beanie, shouting into our car to turn around.  The citizens of the village of I-20 are orchestrating a retreat!  All cars are to pull forward and to the left, as each lane turns around and empties onto the Carrier entrance ramp...It was so cool.
I did donuts in the Redbird parking lot, and as I traded spots with my dad, joking about how funny it would be if I slid downhill and couldn't get back up to the car..
I slid downhill and couldn't get back up to the car.  My fingers were inches from the door, and yet I was stuck...it was amusing...albeit frightening.
Finally, I dug my fingernails in and pulled up to the door...thank God for claws.

It's the first time in years that my family has celebrated the 15th.

It was the sweetest thing...

Last year, I went on a field trip to the Sixth floor museum with CJSA.  Unfortunately, I underestimated the large quantity of loud black people we had in our group, and I made the mistake of taking my time on the sixth floor.  I knew that we had several hours, so I stopped at each picture, reading the captions and really getting in to it.  I saved the best for last...
The Pulitzer Prize photograph exhibit on the seventh floor.
I thought about it while I looked at the pictures of Jackie O. scooping brains off the back of the president's car, and my stomach turned with anticipation as I finished with JFK and mounted the stairs up to the exhibit that I had been waiting for for over an hour.
I walked into a nearly empty, silent room.  There were photos, blown up more than ten times and hanging from walls and display boards all over the seventh floor of the book depository.  I made a line for the first grouping of picutes.  I stood two feet from some of the most intense moments ever captured on film.  Each picture had a story, and I soaked them all in like a sponge.  As I was making my way past the 2nd display board, a scene caught my eye and stopped me dead in my tracks.  
There was a picture of a woman on the ground in a veteren's cemetery, head in her arm, embracing the tombstone of her dead husband.  A man who had fought in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam and who had been dead less than a year.  For some reason, this particular photograph really got to me.  I stood there staring at it for a good 5 minutes as the kids pushed past me and onto the next grouping.  It nearly brought tears to my eyes, and I had to move on before I embarrassed myself in front of all these oblivious children who were laughing and shoving each other around.
It was only a moment later that the security guards came in and told us all to leave.  I never got to finish the exhibit...and we ended up spending the rest of the day at the West End Marketplace.  But I just couldn't get the images out of my mind.  I was angry and disappointed that I got to see less than a tenth of the photos, and I bitched for a good week about it to everyone.
Months later, I open a box wrapped in plain brown paper only to find a book titled ""Capture the Moment"" The Pulitzer Prize photographs.  It has every picture that was at the exhibit, with the exact same stories to accompany them...
I nearly cried...that girl can be so sweet.
I feel so guilty...now what am I going to get for her?"

I think she's mad that I know
But I'm glad that she knows that I'm here if she needs me
Its a good feeling...knowing that someone's there...even if you aren't really friends with them.

Since I was old enough to get a sense of the world at large,  I have always been interested in new things.  Each day is a quest for knowledge and a search to find those unexplored avenues, untapped skills...and unexperienced experiences...
I always thought that once I accumulated enough life experience and information that I would be happy...but I have found, as my search has narrowed and my choices have dwindled, that I am not increasing my happiness at all.  Every time I wear out a new gig, I lose something. My zest for life has been worn out, and, ironically enough, I am left feeling more empty than ever before.
There isn't much that gets me excited anymore.  At first, girls were infinately interesting
Then sex...but that's grown old
Drugs are exciting...but I've worn most all of them out
and what is left?
I am like a heroin addict that keeps upping the dosage of smack until he finds one day that he can't get any higher and he is found the next morning, face down on the tile with a needle sticking out of his arm.
I need something new...I need something stronger...
Only, you can't OD on life.

So maybe all of that doesn't make any sense, but I'm running on 3 hours of sleep since Saturday and the world looks a little fucked up right now.

I'll probably delete this later"

My brain is still not altogether all together if you know what I mean.  I still haven't really slept or eaten anything since Saturday afternoon.
It wasn't as great a get together as it should have been...
eight people on one sack 
We ended up getting a good deal on some ice.  I threw in twenty on a 2 bill sack...2g for two bills (that's drug dealer talk)
That was the first time I've ever done ice, and I don't think I really knew what to expect.  It was really weird, the way it affected my short term memory and my sensory perception.  Everything felt really good, like when you're on speed, only ten times the goodness...and I couldn't remember things from minute to minute.  Like, I was talking to Christina and she looked at me like I was crazy and said ""did you just say something?"" and I thought for a second...and I didn't remember whether I had or not...and then I thought some more...and I forgot what we were talking about all together in the first place. It was excrutiatingly difficult to keep up conversation, but somehow direly necessary.

And now for something completely different...

You know...passion is a word as dangerously overused as love and hate.  I think that people underestimate the meaning behind the letters.  It is so often used without understanding of its depth that it has become almost passe.  Thanks to the world of shitty literature and daytime television, passion has become the cover of a Danielle Steele novel or the title of a daytime soap opera.  I guess it means more to me because until just recently, I never really knew that I had any passion in me.  When I fell in love, I found out what it meant to be passionate about someone...and this weekend I realized what it means to be passionate about something.

Writing is my passion

It is inexplicable, inexplainable, and indescribable...the way I feel when I put myself out there on paper for everyone to read.  
On Saturday night, I was sitting in the bathroom and thinking of how nice it felt to have everyone back over at Ana's house...like it was in the summer.  I was just sitting there on the hamper, thinking and playing with all of Ana's cool bath stuff, when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.  There was a drop of water rolling down the side of the tub, slowly making its journey to a small puddle on the floor.  All of the sudden I could feel the gentle tug of gravity and the cool ceramic on my skin.  I know it sounds stupid, but sometimes when I see something very beautiful or very strange...or even something very mundane that happens to catch my eye, I internalize it.  It feels like I am being dragged into the experience, instead of watching on the sidelines.  When I saw that drop of water, my heart began to race and a bolt of lightning shot through my veins.  It was beautiful somehow, and I knew that I had to write about it.  So I stared for awhile and let myself float in and out of the detail while I thought of all the words that would describe the tiny droplet as I felt it...as more than just the obvious concrete explanation...as a sensory experience that is singularly beautiful.
This is all very stupid to you, I'm sure.  I sound like a pretentious artist with an accent mark....the kind of guy you want to grab by the pony tail and throw into a sea of sharks, ruining his tre chic black turtleneck.  
that was random...

In any case...that's what passion means to me.  

and to the point of all this introduction...
I almost thought that I had a passion for speed
I thought it
I FELT it
That drug could be my everything, I know it could.  I am so powerless to it...it really frightens me.
If passion is the depths of sense and soul...and a drug can so easily be that for me...then how much substance does my life really have?  How much substance does life really have?"

My uncle bought me a blue rosebush for Valentine's Day. 
Jessica is a genius...thoughtful to the core.

So far my weekend has been good.

I got drunk last night and I didn't pass out, or puke, or make an ass of myself.  It was great.  I love Chad...he told me ""ok, here's the thing.  You drink like a dude, but you can't handle your shit like a dude.  You can drink a lot, you just have to do it slower.""  So I did.  And it was great.  And I love talking to Chad when I get fucked up.  He's awesome, even though he puts up an asshole front.
Perhaps there is something between us...I wish he would make it less easy for me.
Cara tried to take advantage of me last night, but I said no...
I'm tired of giving in every time...I'm weak...but I need to learn to be stronger."

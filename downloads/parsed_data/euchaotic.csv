"event","I sucessfully shopped for, picked out, puchased and received <a href=""http://www.runningfree.com/Includes/Gear%20Includes/Footwear%20Includes/asics_1100blue_mens.jpg"">shoes</a> online!

I've never been this excited about buying shoes since... well, ever!

The best part is they fit pefectly, too! Like running shoes, that are hard to fit!

Do you know what this means? If I can buy shoes online, that means I could buy all my clothes online. And if I could <a href=""http://www.sbillington.com/Braveheart2/BH20.jpg"">sack York</a>, that means I could invade lower England!"

"event","<p>Alright, you all know the dillemma that faces me. Any guy who's lived with other guys, (...and girls, you probably know too) knows the feeling of dread when they stroll into the bathroom, reading material gleefully a-tow, and stare woefully into the black-cardboard-hole of despair that <i>was</i> the last of the toilet paper. Oh, yeah, the roomate who so clearly was here before me probably had some clever MacGuyver like scheme to fold and refold the last square of TP into a contrived samurai sword of excremental expunging, thereby asserting his strategic position as ""last to have used the bathroom"". But now, in my moment of need, I lack the raw materials with which to make so elegant a maneuver. The burden falls on me to be <b>that guy</b><br><br><lj-cut text=""This post is double quilted...""><br></p><p>Y'know,<b>that guy</b> in Wal-Mart trying to smuggle the 48 pack of Charmin Xtra up to the front, and masking this most delicate of purchase by locking a death stare on the gum rack. <b>That guy</b> in CVS standing in the way-too-long-line-for-a-corner-pharmacy with a monolithic cellophane square of bathroom tissue, looking like he's hauling a lodestone for Pharoah Poopankamen's Great Pyramid, all the while trying to maintain his coolness by humming quietly to himself and wishing that he was at least a 2nd level caster and had prepared Invisibility this morning. My fate, tonight, is to be <b>that guy</b>. </p><p>There's no way to avoid it. Nothing I can do. My roomates are either not here (owing to the fact that they all have girlfriends with invariably well stocked bathrooms) or have long ago set their ""schedule"" so that work and ""business"" coincide. Me, I'm left to fend for myself somewhere bewteen the Tampons and the Stationery. Rather than hang my head low in shame, like a elementary school teacher in the ""back room"" of the video store, I resolve to stride into the local toiletry vendor with a smile on my face, pull down the biggest, fluffiest cube o' TP I can find and make my purchase. I will accept my destiny, proud to be just another shitty citizen of the U.S. of A-holes, better known as <b>that guy</b></p>"

"event","I recently received in the mail a mailing about the Vietnam Veterans of America clothing drive going on in June.  I think that even if you're politics don't indicate support for the current war in Iraq, donation to the VVA would be a great way to support our troops (past, present, and future) in a more tangible and appropriate way than a gaudy yellow bumper sticker, IMNSHO. The best part is, you just have to bag the stuff up and schedule a date, they'll swing by and pick it up for you. It's basically the same as throwing the stuff away anyways.<br><br>The VVA is a legitimate non-profit organization officially chartered by Congress. For more information on the VVA, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_of_America"">Go Here</a>.<br><br>To sign up for the drive go to <a href=""http://www.scheduleapickup.com"">www.scheduleapickup.com</a>.<br><br>Yes, I am a dirty, hippie, liberal activist.

"event","Jason has had the theme song from Neon Gensis Evangelion (<i>A Cruel Angel's Thesis</i>) stuck in his head for aproximately 2 days. Not the whole song, just what they play right before he goes to sleep on [adult swim]. According to WinAmp, this amounts to one minute and thirty-five seconds of music. If Jason sleeps for 6 hours a night, and the <b><i>rest of the friggen day</i></b> he has this song running through his head, how many separate instances of the Evangelion themesong has Jason thunk?<br><br><lj-cut><br><br><b>The Answer:</b>   2 days = 48 hours - 12 for sleep = 36 hours of ""thinking time""<br><br>36 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 2160 minutes<br><br>2160 minutes / 1.583 (approx 1 min. 35 sec.) = 1,364.5 separate instances of the song.<br><br>That's not <i>that</i> bad,"

"event","<p>I am not, however, a buffet of manliness. Much to the chagrin of
Milky Way(s) everywhere. See, a buffet is a low-cost substandard method
of food acquisition typically employed by the impoverished, unhealthy,
or lazy. And, yes, while a buffet does offer a wide range of choices
and seemingly unlimited quanitity to the savvy consumer, what it lacks
is the real heart and soul of what it means to be food. It lacks the
focus and humble perfected simplicity found in a single portion
prepared meal. It ain't got no taste, it ain't got no class, and by the
transitive property of Brando, is therefore not a contender.</p><p><i>But
Jason, you're like, the most manly person I know, though! What food
analogy/homonym could you be besides the ubiquitous buffet?!</i></p><p>Easy
friend, no need to panic! Though oft confused for ""buffet"" in speech,
I am a Pafait of Manliness! Parfait, of course, coming from the french
for perfect (nobody that speaks French can be bad, right?). A parfait
is the pefect end to the perfect meal. An exquisite balance of tastes
and textures that not only is a course in its own right but compliments
<i>and</i> supplements those portions previous. The parfait is not a
dessert, it is an experience. A synergistic expression of what it means
for a meal to come to the conclusion in the right way. Like a flag
stuck in the conquered territory of your own darkest, deepest, most
personal levels of human statisfaction. That is what kind of
""manliness"" I stand for. Not the manliness that comes with a fountain
soda and all the heat-lamp-warmed beef you can shovel into your
spork-hole. Oh no. I'm the type of ""manliness"" that makes you wish you
had saved more room for me, that makes you wish you could start the
night all over again just so that the entire experience of building up
to the crescendo of my ""manliness"" could take place all over again.
'Cause that's how unforgettable my manliness is.</p><p> So I say to you, are you a buffet of manliness? Or are you a parfait of manliness?</p><p>lol, blogging</p><p>You stay classy, teh LJ.</p>"

"event","So in my 23 years of life on this planet today is the day I realize that there is no such word as offage. Though I feel like I've used it fifteen thousand timjes before when I was a bank teller, or when measuring when I did construction. Indeed it appears  on neither Dictionary.com nor Google's define function (although you definately can Google <i>search</i> the word). 

After a light hearted debate with the CFO, we decided the proper word to use is ""variance"".  Oh well, at least I got overtime on account of semantics."

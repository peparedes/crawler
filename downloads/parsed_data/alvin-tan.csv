HOW... can there EVER, be no eggs in my home!!!! This is pure cruelty! There is totally no respect for that which gives Life! That which gives air to the breathing, light to the seeing, sound to the hearing...

This is terrible! I am almost absolutely certain that the world is hence coming to an end. TO an END!!! For the very fact that the source of Life, the essence of anything beating and moving, is absent from home!

I am shocked. My system is in chaos. I have lost all orientation. There is nothing left to hold on to, nothing left to hold me back. I am lost.

I feel what constitutes me peeling away, shriveling up- dust to dust. 

There are no eggs... left... in my home."

Am actually hunting for a song that has lyrics like I have a girlfriend who is my boyfriend or something like that. If anyone knows what song it is please do let me know. Ya the lyrics is rather weird but hey, it can be rather cute as well... especially when it the melody is catchy.

Shall have to get my reading over and done with. It's quite awesome how someone can sell trash and still make billions. You can do it too... just think of some trash that'll definitely harm the body, and market it amazing well to all sorts of niches. Lo and behold, fortune and followers beyond your wildest dreams! And again, no prizes for guessing who or what I'm talking about!"

Am rather disturbed by what's happening to one of my friends. Things got quite complicated for him and I hope he solve it like a man and not run away from it. Face it. Deal with it. But one thing's for sure. If I'm him, I won't even cross the line to dabble in such troubles myself. What troubles? Too sensitive to tell... 

My life is so boring. So much so that I have nothing to blog! The horror. But then again, I'd rather have a boring life than have an exciting life of exams. I accept my boring fate with open arms. Just had durian puffs. They remind me of the wonderful and addictive during pudding at Merchant Court. The buffet there is rather ordinary however the durian pudding is like the icing on the cake. Absolutely different and wonderfully delightful. 

Was having dinner with guopeng and co. and just realised that Chinese New Year is not too long from now! Come second sem, right smack into Chinese New Year festivities. I'm very thankful actually for having a wonderful childhood memories of Chinese New Year celebrations. Sigh... reminiscing makes me feel so old. Also, I'm visiting less and less places as the years go by. No prizes for guessing why. 

K... I'm just typing on and on... Shall just go read the materials for my Monday 5pm paper. 5pm! That's like so damn bloody late lor! Still need to go Heeren after that. I wanna get this last paper over and done with!!!!"

Tried running abit somemore. Stamina definitely dropped like dunno what. Run abit then start to stitch even. But heck. I'd rather stitch at both sides of my midsection than to have to study for exams. I really dread this period of the semester. Finally I'm just down to one. One that's open book, level 1000. *Clasps hands together with glee*.

"event","Finally decided that I should make one short entry. Been rather busy with exams and couldn't spare the guilt of spending precious time typing out my boring life. Study, eat, sleep (minimally)... and occasionally take a bus out of this hell hole so as to take in some fresh, non exam air. 

Was at Harbour Front yesterday. Jolly good place after the renovation i should say. Rather self sufficient, in fact, I think it's well balanced in terms of catering to diverse Singaporean needs. Had subway there which as usual is a orgasmic experience. Came back pronto to hit the books. Frankly speaking, not feeling that gan jiong this exam period as compared to my previous four semesters. Dunno why.

Shall go back to reading Singapore's foreign policy. Nothing in depth. Just mediocre knowledge. After all, it's a level 2000 module.

Shall end off with a joke...

A Singapore English radio station, was holding a live radio segment at a shopping mall. The DJ was hosting a game show where prizes were given away to kids on stage if they could name the opposite gender of animals. The first kid to come on stage was a girl. ""What's your name girl & how old are you?""

""My name is Cheryl & I am 8 years old.""

""OK, tell me Cheryl, what is the opposite of cow?"" ""Bull.""

""Very good! That's correct. Now here's a Barbie doll for you. Ladies & gentlemen, please give her a round of applause.""

The game then continued for the next 15 minutes in a similar fashion with the kids getting all the simple questions correct until it was time for the 10th kid to come on stage. The audience were very impressed with this kid as he was very clever & articulate from the moment he stepped on stage, before being asked, announced, ""My name is Johnny. I am 7 years old and I like English, Math & Art. My hobbies are collecting stamps & stickers.""

The audience liked him immediately because of his confidence & had started to clap for him. His parents, standing right in front of the stage, were beaming with pride at how smart their son was.

""OK, Johnny, you should know the answer to this question very well. Close 2 eyes also can answer. Tell me, what is the opposite of cock?""

The young boy paused for a moment, scratched his head, moved closer to the microphone & finally answered proudly, ""Chee Bai!"""

"event","My home feels like just the bestest place to be. The only place where I can absolutely feel right at ease. Not to mention the comfort of air conditioning and having lots of stuff to snack on.

The past few days have been rather occupied. Went to have Ala-Carte Chinese Buffet at Noble House (Tung Lok) on Friday with Shuwen, Gerald, Guo Peng and his gf, who came from China and here to pay him a visit, and at the same time syphon him of his cash and time (shh... dun tell ppl that I said that...) The food, as usual, were fantastic and I really had the time of my life eating fish after fish. I believe we consumed an entire salmon during the course of that night. After dinner we walked to the esplanade, behaving just like tourists and being extremely trigger happy (camera wise... of course).

Yesterday was LimGY aka Xiao eh aka Clara's birthday. To me, it was a gigantic birthday party and an absolute hell to organise. But she and especially her family and friends (er hem ;P) pulled it off and it turned out to be a great night. Really hope she enjoyed it, at least proportionate to the immense effort put into it. Gerald was of course the man of the night, moving from table to table, from group to group, being formally introduced to Clara's friends and relatives. Quite an amusing sight if you asked me. He seemed pretty stressed... then again, who wouldn't?

Now, after 2 consecutive days of merry, is time to be brought back to earth. To finish my papers, and to start preparing for exams... Yawn.

Got training later today. Hope the guys will put in more effort. We're so far from being competitive."

"event","Something that is currently highly elusive, highly delusional. What is rest may just mean pre-work, pre-stress. So should we dread when it's time to rest? Cos it just means preparing to work, preparing for disgusting procedures of opening books, typing furiously on the keyboard, flipping books again. The process goes on, infinitely, with the end seemingly far and beyond reach. 

I'm tired. That a fact. And only a totally worry free, stress detached life can being me that rest. Which brings me to the point... What do I actually want in my life?

The comfort that money would provide, with its associated stress and lack of the other benefits that life will bring outside work, work and work? Or just the average middle income life, with money that's enough to give you the neccesities with just abit extra; however with it comes the satisfaction of knowing that life has been thoroughly explored and experiences abundant and meaningful. The latter or the former. 

I have decided."

"event","Ever heard of a song with the words ""Tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree..."" Well, it's a song about a guy who was sent to prison, and when he was about to be released he wrote back to his parents asking them to tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree, if they forgive him and are willing to accept him back into their home. When he was released and he went back to his parents' home, the old oak tree in front of their home was tied full of yellow ribbons. *Sob*... so touching.

Why ask and talk about this song, well, recently my friend was helping dunno which organisation to sell yellow ribbons, and I bought one! This is to encourage those released from prison telling them that people are willing to accept and to assimilate them back into society. This also tells people not to stigmatise and ostracise people who were previously in prison but may be now out in the society and very willing to change and get along with their lives.

The pace of life is seriously picking up and it's almost stifling. The constant worry of not catching up, of falling back, of accumulating beyond redemption. 

Now I have to finish reading what I left off... and after that prepare for my test this Thursday.

One being extremely dilapidated and the other nicely renovated, with a kind of ""staged"" authenticity. I wonder why one side is renovated and the other not... won't it have an effect on the general landscape as a whole? A sort of negative externality? I'm not sure...

Though quality of the pics really far less than desired, but it does serve its purpose. A pic tells a thousand words. In other words, I just composed a 3000 word plus entry. Now try to beat that!"

Went to send Kwara off at the airport in the morning. Off she went for exchange in England. She was carrying enough luggage for two, so much so that they have to ask her to offload some. SHe didn't do so lah, only transfered her stuff to a ""slimmer"" looking bag... Such resourcefulness. Before she went into the departure hall she didn't seem even the least emotional about leaving, unlike her friend who was travelling with her. 
Here are some pics just before she left, taken with my Motorola V690. Not very clear but it serves its purpose. These were taken when she was trying to steamline her handcarry luggage. Funny la...

In the afternoon, training as usual. Not too bad. Finally we're rowing intensive sets as a boat. At least we're progressing somewhere. No time already.

Dinner was spent with THOC0304. Really happy times everytime we come together. Even though we're all different personalities, different directions in life, each possessing different perspectives in life, it really is enjoyable and memorable everytime we come together. I really hope this is one group of friends that will stick together, regardless of time and regardless of circumstance. An ideal outcome, achieveable with some effort.

It's a rather run-down and old swimming complex and I don't think it's still in use anymore. Hence this year's DnD committee booked the pool so that we could have it IN the pool. A tentage was set over the pool, with air conditioning and the works- lights etc. 
At first when we went there, it felt abit off cos there was no music and was quite dark. The only consolation was that they were distributing free beer- no complains with that. Slowly and steadily, the crowd starting to pour in (no pun intended). Things started to look ""brighter"" from then on. First the Naruto group with Veron as the dunno what but she looks sibey cute lah. Then came the pugilists. Also sibey cute bunch. These two groups were in the finals of the best dressed table. The pugilist won it eventually. They really put in alot alot of effort to materialise their theme. I got to give it to them.
The food- sucks. it's somewhat like a buffet style. Not alot of varieties and no very nice. Ah well... it's catered and in the pool anyways. Still the free beer rocks!
Decided that it's not the DnD that's fun but the people attending the DnD that made it all fun and laughter. 
But i still rather have it in the Ball room lah. 
Quite shack liao. Tmr morning still got inter block swimming and training in the afternoon. Better go hit the sack already.

"event","After 2 mths, I decided that it's definitely not easy to manage a team like the one I'm in. Dragonboat, where our efforts, minds and heart must be in sync. 
Team building- The juniors are here. They are not too bad, in fact, some of them are actually quite good. However, it's actually the seniors that are giving the problems. Not turning up for training, giving crappy excuses, not being serious in training. 

What I mean by being serious in training?
To put in a 100%. That's to say the very least. It's really ok to joke and chat. We're not the army you know. However, it's a problem when you joke and chat when you're supposed to be pulling your hearts out. That's when I think things are not in line. Then again, who are we to take the fun out of training? That's why I reiterate that team management is a touchy issue. You say too much, people think you've got a dildo up your ass. You say too little, people think that you are not vocal enough and not in full control of the team. 

Screw all of them.

And there's this particular someone who really dissed me off proper. Give him an example of a role model, he thinks we want him to be an exact replica. Tell him that's not what we mean, he thinks we mean the other end of the spectrum. UNIVERSITY student for fucking crying out loud! He epitomises the phrase ""one track mind""! How can I teach you how to be a role model? How can I teach you how you should behave in front of the juniors? Should I teach you how to treat your gf? How to take a crap ""properly""? Dammit man use your brains and what every human should possess- initiafuckingtive! All he thinks is that we're not talking to the people who really needs us to come down hard on them. Well... that's not the pt aint it?!?! It's what all the seniors are supposed to do when we're down for training! He can go dildo his ass la!

Ok... that's the purpose of having a blog. To vent your frustrations and to ask people to fuck off without really telling them and without them really hating you. Fuck OFF!

Phew... My heart beat's really up and running. Must be the really crappy and fatty chicken cutlet that's taking it's toll. I really should get down to doing my work."

How do you define a good friend? How do I define a good friend in MY terms? Definitely there's no universal definition of a good friend. The best definition of a good friend would be one that comes from each individual; in my case, myself.
I believe I'm someone who puts in alot in a friendship. Sometimes detrimental to myself cos I would judge a friend base on his/her ability to reciprocate. But I just cannot help it. If i were to go all out for a friend, should i not expect him/her to go all out for me as well? If i'm willing to trade off some of my time to spend time with him/her, should i expect such a behaviour in return, in the future? 
What should you do when you realise that someone you've been calling friend almost forever does not seem to appreciate what you did for him/her. Either that or he/she just does not know how to show it. Should i accept that as an excuse and live life as it already is? 
Actually, sometimes i think to myself.. is it me? Am I demanding too much? Am i dissing people off? Am i just simply thinking too damn much about how friendships should be? Should friendship be just ""be there when i can"", ""when i feel like it"", ""shouldn't be much of a trade off associated with friends"".
Is friendship just so shallow?
Have you ever thought of who you can depend on when you are down in the depths?
Is it sissy to think about such stuff? Or do men just have ""friends"". No good friends, no very very good friends?
I think i'm just insecure.
Perhaps... 
I have so much running through my mind right now. Who should i turn to? How i wish i have another me to talk to. To analyse myself. To be my friend.
By the way, I have to clarify something. It's not that I do not have friends. It's just the stage of my life that I need to know who can be there when it's crunch time? Who can I talk to when I need to pour out pent up emotions? WHo? Who? Who?
It's not that someone I have in mind. It's not him.
Thank God I have her."

Yup! That little grey rascal is back in his humble abode. For those who are absolutely clueless as to who Xiaohui is, he's a grey dwarf hamster that I bought for Shuwen for her 20th birthday. A week ago, Shuwen let him run around the room for awhile. With such an opportunity at hand, he decided to capitalise on our huge size as well as a crack in the side of the cupboard to make his great ""escapade"". He succeeded... or so he thought. For the entire week, he would come out only at unexpected times for food, which we mercifully left just outside the hole, and water. It's either his extremely well developed intuition or his extreme knowledge of Shuwen's daily activites. He did manage to evade all forms of life in the room for the past week. Just amazing. However, just not too long ago, he ""chanced"" upon Shuwen on her way out of the room. Shuwen also quite lucky lah. They made eye contact for a moment and that's it. Back into his pink cage he went. Click... and his little stint in the hole in the cupboard is history. A memory of the past, a sweet memory perhaps... never again revisited.

Heh... I personally find this all too dramatic and amusing. Him coming out to ""steal"" food in the still of the night. I thought he's lost to us forever. 
To err is human... in this case, to err is hamster.
He made his error, and forever bid farewell to his precious hole. 
I seriously think he likes it there... he's still trying to bite his way out of his steel cage. Trying... <font color=""#000000"">trying</font>... <font color=""#000000"">trying...
</font>

K... that's all for Xiaohui and hole by the cupboard. For all other hamster owners out there, take heed. For your hamster might just await its opportunity to take off into his own little hole."

Makes you feel great and energized, ready to face the world and all its imperfections. Thanks to Zhihao, now i have someone to accompany me to the pool! But his breast stroke damn fast lah. Or more aptly put, I swim like slow-mo.
Why the sudden enthusiasm towards swimming? Well... maybe cos going to the gym has become rather mundane and monotonous and hence a new form of activity is so much appreciated and sought after.&nbsp; Secondly, After watching the clash of the titans in this morning's Athens swim between Thorpe and that Dutch guy next to him, I feel so inspired! Think I almost THERE liao. Hahaaa...

It's damn frustration. His replies and his lack of emotions. I'm not gay, but there are just some things where keeping a straight face just doesn't work. Maybe he's taking it for granted that things done for him is within a friend's ""job scope"". I don't think so!
Is it me or am I just having issues. This has been on my mind for quite a long time already. Dunno whether I'm just imposing my standards on people. I don't think so leh. But maybe i'm a poor judge of myself.
I hate being taken for granted. Especially when someone claims to be one of your better friends. Or maybe it's just me claiming that someone as one of my better friends. This sucks lah. It makes me think who else can I really depend on in times of need. Will I just be there hanging by myself, stared at by a sea of crocs and sharks, awaiting doom and with that so called good friend just standing by the bank and waving, telling me to have fun...
K... i better get a grip of myself. Such thoughts are poisoning my mind. I should always give people the benefit of doubt. That some people are just absolute emotional vacuums and asking him to say a simple thank you will demand his immediate unconditional death and condemnation. There may be such people in the world you know... I'm trying to convince myself just that.
And I just hate it when I type a long sms and all I get it ""Orh..""

"event","How much do you put into a relationship? Does it mean that what you give you should receive? Though that is the desirable outcome, we should all know by now that things that result are usually not the ideal. One party may give more than the other, in terms of time, energy and even emotions. Not being able to reconcile this within the individual almost always lead to relationship problems and eventual seperation and unhappiness.
But how to reconcile? Sometimes I ask myself... I mean, how much can you give in excess as compared to your partner? Of course if one gives too much and receives little naturally it won't end well.
Basically it's how well you play ball lah. If you can't play the game well, your partner will just keep thinking that you're not putting enough into the relationship, which in fact you may have but in small measures not very noticeable to the inattentive.
Actually if you come to think about it, who cares!? As long as the person is of good character, loves you, can't stop thinking of you, whose life revolves around you, tattoos your name on their body, can liao!

Went shopping for Shuwen's friend's bday present after that. Shack sia. Stamina drop liao. Must be the buffet. Whole day feeling darn sleepy.

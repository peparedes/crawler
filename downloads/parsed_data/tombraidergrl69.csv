                  The Reason -  by hoobastank
I'm not a perfect person
as many things I wish I didn't do
but I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
and so I have to say before I go
that I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
to change who I used to be
a reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
it's something I must live with everyday
and all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
and be the one who catches all your tears
that's why I need you to hear

I've found a resaon for me
to change who I used to be
a reason to start over new
and the reason is you
and the reason is you
and the reason is you
and the reason is you

I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
and so I have to say before I go
that I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
to change who I used to be
a reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I've found a reason to show
a side of me you didn't know
a reason for all that I do
and the reason is you"

Why does it hurt when you feel all alone, Cutting in deep straight through the bone? Surrounded by darkness and feeling so cold, Wanting to touch when there's no one to hold, Wanting to talk when there's no one to hear, Alone in the dark drowning with fear. Why does it hurt when you feel all alone, Taken from the warm feelings you once had known? With eyes like clouds and tears of rain, Driven inside deep is the pain, a broken heart that just won't mend feeling alone in the world without a friend. Why does it hurt when you feel all alone? When you once stood in the light, the sun had shone Hiding within the darkest despair, as feelings within no one will care. Misery is the only company you got for when you feel alone you feel it a lot.</LABEL>"

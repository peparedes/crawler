"event","I'm so tired right now, yesterday I had to wake up at like 7am and go to work for 8 hours. Fun Fun. At least the pay is good though, lol. I got sunburnt sooo bad yesterday....on my friggin' feet...weird. Then I had to babysit my braty sister and my two younger cousins, talk about a living nightmare, they are horrible, and together they never shut-up, or stop arguing.

Things got better though as I went to Katie N.'s party. It was pretty fun, I wasn't planning on swimming though (because of reasons beyond my control), so I didn't bring a suit or anything. But then Bre made a deal, that if I got in the pool, she would too. So I made a quick check, it being the 7th day and all, and lucky for Bre, I was able to swim. And so I went back outside to share the good news, however, I still lacked a swim suit. No need to fear though, I took off my pants and jumped in the water with just my shirt and panties! Oh yeah, that was fun. And I'm Chelsea's hero now, yay! ^_^

Today however is not so great. I am stuck baby-sitting yet again. They woke me up at like 10 am by banging the hell outta my effing door. Grrr! They piss me off soooo bad. Oh well...back to baby-sitting."

Question....; Is life really necessary? Seriously not meaning to want to die or kill myself but in the physical and astronomical aspect. I believe...well believe is too strong of a word, I think it honestly is.
Life is a perpual motion of mass, in which mass is a motion of energy particles...kind of like the ""idea"" of time, (note if there was no time there would be no life because time is a measurment of the motion of particle...time in itself is a theory.) In this, our universe time is the meaning of life. They are co-dependent variable, you can't have one with out the other.
The universe is randomly expanding creating energy and as stated previously mass is energy, life is started by a chemical reaction of gases that create microbes like bacteria and bacteria tend to mutate quickly. Mutation is an extreme version of evolution. So logically life was created randomly by whatever. Ergo, if we were never created the universe would still exist just not us. The chemical and biological energy is gained from consuming other life so if there was no life it wouldnt change anything in the rest of the universe, a closed inviroment stable for only so long untill the end of time, Time being a measurement not an actual tangable thing. No life there still would be time just no concept of it. so life is really not necessary, if life didnt exist it wouldnt change any universal variables. Life is at random and the meaning of life is time."

i walked down 17th for a bit, people on the bus were watching me a lot
and i don't know why. and when i was walking people kept eyeing me too.
self conscious. i wanted to go to see ms. shaw for some help in
science. i didn't call it school i called it western because it's not
my fucking school. well hopefully not for much longer at least. <br>

some guy on the side of the street asked for some spare change miss,
and i said sure and dumped my whole change purse into his hands and
walked away. there was at least 5 dollars in there, and i could hear
him yelling thank you to me as i walked away. i dont know why i did
that. i just did. usually i dont give that much. maybe a buck or two,
if any. theyre just going to buy licquor with it anyway. i didnt know
why i did it and i felt stupid after, yet generous at the same time. <br>

i went into western and upstairs and barely worked on science at all. i
left at 3 and walked into a bunch of stores to burn off the time i had
on my hands. i went into divine and saw marlee watts there. havent seen
her forever. she was really nice and all, and gave me a hug and i hung
out with her and people for a while but it just didnt feel right. she
gave me horrific vibes and i wanted to get outta there so finally i
did. i walked up some more and got on and off the number 2 about
eighty-three times. then i bought this batman comic and finally headed
home. <br>

i really wanted to stab kelton in the throat this morning, cause i
couldnt sleep last night thinking about him. and his teeth. his goddamn
teeth that were brace-less and perfect. stupid gorgeous teeth, i wanted
to smack him so hard this morning but he wasnt there. i wish he was
there and i probably wouldnt have smacked him anways. just been cold.
he's stupid and makes me angry. its probably cause hes so nice to me
most of the time that whenever he has even the slightest glitch he
makes me seem like a mad man. for chrissake his stupid teeth.<br>

i dont really know what the feeling of knowing anything is anymore
cause i havent really known anything for nearly 3 years now. its kinda
faded off of me. i just wanted to get a couple of drinks today and get
it over with or something, get the alcohol longing out of my system. i
even had a cigar with me but i didnt smoke it cause i wanted something
to drink.<br>
<br>

what a stupid blog entry. im making this private cause its stupid.<br>

i'm stupid too. <br>

really stupid. </font>

i wish you'd leave then wish you'd stay<br>

or for a while just go away?<br>

or just be gone right from the start<br>

and drop your name right off my cart<br>

onto the floor, forever lost<br>

steering clear<br>

from another emotional holocaust<br>

clear of love hatred and lust<br>

i love friend ipod present life cake julios barrio<br>
<br>

for my birthday i dont really want anything<br>

i just want <br>
<b>1)</b> to go to cafe med on friday with jazmin and jack<br>

and then<br>
<b>2)</b> i want all my gf's to come to dinner with me on like saturday night <br>

and then<br>
<b>3)</b> later on i want zayn to take me to the jubilee auditorium and see a show with me.<br>

and then<br>
<b>4)</b> for kelton to take me somewhere.. i dont know..<br>

thats all i want for my birthday and it would be perfect if that actually happened<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

i hate my dad sometimes<br>

its like in this family everything i do is blown out of porportion<br>

like<br>

sometimes im thankful that they dont let me do whatever the hell i want<br>

but sometimes.. i just dont understand why i'm so sheltered and withheld from so many things i want to do<br>

i guess life just works that way<br>
<br>

but after a lot of shit..<u> it finally hit me</u><br>

i have no idea where my life is going<br>

my life revolves around smoking and drinking and looking in the mirror every day and hating what i look like<br>

wanting to abuse myself in some way some how<br>

to get my anger out<br>

and thats basically it<br>

and music i guess<br>

it revolves around the most retarded shit<br>

and my marks are horrible<br>

i remember when i used to be so smart<br>

well i dont think im any dumber<br>

i just think of lost a hell of a lot of motivation<br>

things just arent coming as fast to me anymore<br>

i need a taste of the future<br>

a taste of what the fuck i'm getting myself into<br>

i feel like a nobody <br>
<br>

i'm no body<br>

a failure<br>

i let down everybody i wanted to live for<br>
<br>

nothing to live for nothing to die for<br>

purpose? <br>

either inexistant or hidden or something<br>

either that or its something absolutely useless<br>
<br>

it's been like this for months maybe just the depressions hit me really core<br>

i wish i could get those pills ASAP but my mom never takes me to the fucking doctor<br>

she says she will but she always forgets<br>
<br>

i just want that one person<br>

that one person in the world you can rely on for anything<br>

and it cant be my mom<br>

who am i going to tell about my piercings and other shit she'll kick my ass for<br>
<br>

i used to have that with mike<br>

but he had to peace because god hates me<br>

something hates me<br>

something powerful<br>

i was such a better person before like a walking angel no joke<br>

grade 8 hit and everything changed<br>

i fell in love with this stupid fucker and he peaced<br>

and everything just went downhill<br>

my marks<br>

my emotions<br>

my passion<br>

my drive<br>

my strength<br>

my good hearted ness<br>

i just stopped giving a shit about everything<br>

and i still dont<br>

it might seem like it but i really dont<br>

like im still really emotional <br>

but nothing fills me<br>

nothing<br>

well<br>

maybe one thing<br>

getting the fuck out of here <br>

or<br>

dying and waking up a different person with a different life<br>
<br>

im just sick of gonig through the same shit every day<br>

and its not good at all<br>

i mean i know school is like.. everyone does it and i cant complain<br>

tanja did it and shit you know<br>

but<br>

i just dont<br>

think<br>

its<br>

right<br>

for me<br>

i feel like i dont belong here<br>

or anywhere<br>

well maybe somewhere but i have no idea where it is<br>

nobody gets me i feel like im talking out of my ass 24/7 and trying to impress people<br>

why do i even wear make up<br>

i hate make up<br>

i hate mac<br>

why do i keep buying mac<br>

so people will think im a happy pretty person<br>

when really im a depressed and mopey piece of shit ugly person<br>

i want to be intoxicated all the time i feel like im addicted to everything thats bad for me<br>

thinking about smoke through my lungs actually makes me feel better sometimes<br>

or being <br>
<br>

i dont know<br>

fuck it i just dont know anything anymore<br>

i dont even know why im here<br>

i used to know<br>

i forget the night everything changed<br>

i forget so much shit and remember so much shit<br>

i have too many goddamn secrets<br>

i wish i could tell people some shit<br>

but i wont<br>

no matter how much i want to<br>
<br>

i acnt feel my goddamn mouth or fingers<br>

im always cold<br>

i want to eat but i dont <br>

cause im gross<br>

and <br>

i dont want to be gross because i want to be good<br>

no body takes the time to know you<br>

its just the glance they give you<br>
<br>

i want that to be a good glance<br>
<br>

i want kelton to like me<br>

i want people to like me<br>

cause maybe ill feel better<br>

i just want to feel better<br>

otherwise fuck reputations<br>

i just want to feel better <br>
<br>

i just want to be better<br>
<br>

then again<br>

at least im not a LIAR LIKE YOU<br>

i cant lie. only to my parents and it only lasts so long<br>

i wish i could lie to my friends<br>

and be like<br>

""i love having sex too its awesome im happy that you did it with some random when you were drunk =) ""<br>

or maybe be so honest that i dont feel bad about hurting their feelings, maybe????<br>

or tell jack <br>

""i think dierdres a stupid bitch to be honest, to be really honest.""<br>

or tell mariel <br>

""i think you're a lying, squirmy little cheat.""<br>

or tell mike<br>

""you hurt me to the point that i wanted to cut my throat and watch
myself bleed, to the point that i walked into a bathroom and broke a
mirror with a glass and then sliced myself with it and made my gramma
cry and then she told everybody that it just shattered by itself, so i
wouldnt have to go into some therapy shit, but then again, no body
really wondered why i was wearing long sleeves in fucking 50 degrees
weather, or why my lip had a cut on it or anything, no one cared, just
hamed, you stupid fucking bitch""<br>

AT LEAST I LET PEOPLE USE ME HAHAHAHAHA<br>

I LET PEOPLE USEEEEEEE MEEEEEEE<br>

ohhhhhhh man im so awesome.<br>
<br>

i remember willa made me feel like me.<br>

made the rojin in me come out<br>

who the fuck is this talking even?<br>

some woman, named joanne or sarah or something<br>

but it's not me talking to you<br>

its not the person that once was<br>

and willa<br>

willa<br>

willa.<br>

willa smoked.<br>

i wish i was willa.<br>

i wish i was willa's daughter.<br>

what was her name?<br>

i wonder if willa ever smacked her<br>

or made her cry on her birthday.<br>
<br>

what a lovely birthday.<br>
<br>

im just glad i have kelton. really. thats all it is.<br>

but<br>

at the same time im just scared<br>

just scared<br>

because day by day<br>

i know its going to get harder the day that comes we have to leave each other for whatever erason<br>

or even in febuary when he peaces i dont know what the fuck im going to do <br>

i dont want it to be like in iran<br>

where we stopped talking to each other<br>

and he did shit behind my back and made me paranoid as fuck<br>

and i became a stupid emo shit<br>

i dont want us to drift apart or for things to get awkward<br>

and i want it to work.. its going to be hard like priest at a playground<br>

and i dont know what im gonig to do...<br>
<br>

and if i get grounded for like 5 months at least he's not here for part of it.. *sigh*<br>

dear jack;
i remember the way things used to be, a bit more clearly than i should. you put a smile on my face while i was gone. it was weird, that i actually felt you belonged in the group of people that i thought maybe really might care about me. i thought you might. the millions of pictures we took. fucking wutangclan. going to your house with travis and you guys handcuffing me. sov teez. all the other bullshit good times that we had.
during the summer etc you and jazmin and i hung out a lot. we were really close. you had your girlfriend, and i was really happy for you. i was glad that you still spent time with us and maintained your friendship with us. i didn't give you any credit, cause why the hell should i? i have a boyfriend and my life doesn't revolve around him. it's not something that's hard to do. it shouldn't be. it isn't.
then you and her broke up. i remember messaging you back and forth through all the shit you went through. i remember i felt so bad when it finally ended. i remember i didn't feel a bit good about it. i remember talking to kelton about it and not being happy. i KNOW that. i wanted you to date her. cause hell, why shouldn't you be happy? as long as we were still friends, having your girlfriend was a bonus for me too. cause she made you happy. and in turn, that made me happy.
then, you got back together. i was happy for you, and i wasn't afraid. because when you were going out with her before, you still hung out with me. you still talked to me.
but not this time i guess. this time, you faded away. you faded away, to the point where i had no idea what was going on with you at all. it was a horrible feeling. horrible vibe.
at one point when it really hit me, i started to cry. and man, did i hate her. i hated her for taking you away for good. i hated her so much and blamed it all on her. i blamed her for all of this shit.
slowly, and agonizingly, i realized none of this was worth it. i wanted you to be my friend for a long time, because i loved you so fucking much. you meant so much to me as a friend, and i realized if i meant the same to you like i thought i did you wouldn't do this for me. having a significant other doesnt mean peacing the rest of your friends. which is why i cut you out of my life too. i was still upset, but i moved on from the pity that i had for myself.
and i realized, also, that she had nothing to do with this. it was you who had to stay friends with me. if you really cared, even if she held you by the collar and said you cant be friends with her anymore, you would have still stayed friends with me. and you know what? she seems like a nice girl. i dont think that she'd even do something like that. none of this has anything to do with her. she's nice, and pretty and doesn't seem bitchy to me at all. this is about YOU. this is about you and the bigger, better fucking deal. you're just another one of them. i thought you were different, but you're not.
i wondered why you left us. jazmin, was it to stay on the safe side? it wasn't jazmins fault. she owes nothing to this, she doesn't need to be faithful to anyone. you're the one who needs to remain responsibility. so she was innocent.
and me? i don't even know what the fuck i did. you and i were solid friends, and you and i both knew that. i don't know what happened. i dont know when the day came that suddenly i didn't mean shit anymore.
i don't know what's happened over the last 2 months that took over the old jack i used to know. the jack that had RESPECT, and also got respect from me in return which is something i dont give many people.
i miss that jack and i hope he's in a better place now or something.

i wish you had never changed.
i'm glad for all the good times we had, jack.
i miss you a lot.

i got 75 american from tanja for my birthday, what nice steez.
i know he's going to go there tonight, and smoke up, while i throw up, throw up,
no there's no light in the darkest of your furthest reaches
please don't let a repetition occur
dont splinter off my dreams and feelings

i would like if this was a good new year
i would like if this year was a good year
i would like if there was less pain in this year
less shit
no shit
none of the shit
can it be? do you think thats possible?
just better for everybody? can things be less difficult?
can i be less confused all the time? i dont want anymore mike's, or any of that kind of shit, i'm sick of it. i would like if people could stop lying and betraying each other this year. i want to get fucking TRASHED. i need to get fucking trashed."

i was reading Oprah today, and i realized how can you accept any joy in anything when you're not happy with your body.<br>

especially not pleasure of any sort.<br>

anorexia? patience/excersize? bulimia? pills? gun? <br>
<br>

thinking about it all makes me want a mars bar.<br>

doing here?'
<br>
does anybody else feel this way? i doubt it.
it's hard to find anything that gives me happiness anymore. nothing
seems to be permanent for more than a few days anymore. something you
can depend on.
<br>
or maybe co-existing things like that, in fact, aren't supposed to
exist. maybe you're supposed to make yourself happy just like everyone
else says.
but i find that hard to believe.
who makes themselves happy these days? the dalai lama? jesus? barbara
streisand? lynne spears? richard gere? you?
maybe.<br>
but that doesn't matter. how many dalai lama's are there? one.
that doesn't matter to me. that doesn't matter.
<br>
i look around at people who i might be able to find inspirational,
something that will make me stop contemplating suicide. make me stop
crying. make me stop watching movies with perfect endings, songs with
perfect beats and perfect voices.
<br>
i thought tanja was perfect. tanja is perfect looking. tanja has the
perfect husband. tanja has a cute kid. tanja has a nice body. tanja
gets a car every christmas. tanja can buy virtually anything. tanja has
an engagement ring the size of my head. tanja's parents favor her over
her sister. tanja has a masters in Biology but doesn't even need to
work because her husband brings home all the dough for her to laugh off
and spend on Louis Vuitton wallets and trips to Hawaii.
but tanja alsostarves herself with salad and coffee every day. she had
to sleep in the hospital. tanja is a liar, and a little kaniving smuck.
<br>
hmm, maybe not.<br>
&nbsp;i thought jen was perfect. jen is beautiful, all the guys drool over
her. jen has an extensive vocabulary. mike was in love with jen, and oh
how i wanted mike, or anyone, to love me too. jen's parents let guys
sleep over at her house. jen had amazing dance skills. when jen walked
down the halls, people would cringe. jen had a rant problem. jen felt
she was superior compared to everyone else.<br>
&nbsp;hmm. i guess not.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;i can think of thousands and thousands of perfect people that i used to
idolize. but now, at this moment, i realize that no body in this world
is even a smidgen of a bit happy. no one. <br>
i need a better place to be.
i need to leave. i tried everything in my power to try and make my life
better. i tried being patient, i tried being nice. i tried to learn new
things. i tried to give people a chance. i tried to let karma get on my
good side. i tried being nice to people on christmas at work.
<br>
but people are ASSHOLES. everyone is an asshole. so am i. we're all
assholes. it's like another, less harsh version of where i come from;
Iran. where the quality of life is so low that people are just stressed
out for every second of their stupid, pointless lives. only here, we
have freedom to hold each others hands in public, and flaunt off our
belly button rings and drink at bars and dance and have a good time on
occassion.
but somehow, somehow it's either us looking for flaws in our
surroundings and each other, or the surroundings not letting us
tolerate it. <br>
either way.<br>
&nbsp;i see it as a shithole. what is it that makes
people so angry? people, including me myself. that we just wont take a
step back for anybody else. angry and selfish. or maybe i should just
be more angry.
<br>
being angry is awesome. you can be cocky and push through people in a
crowd and not give a fuck if you're pissing them off, cause 10 bucks
bets you're angrier than them.
<br>
its awesome cause you can be ignorant and not move a step forward on
the bus to let someone else, and laugh it off cause you make them wait
another 15 minutes in the cold while youre inside a heated bus.
<br>
it's awesome cause you don't HAVE to give a shit about what other
people feel, how badly i'm hurting them inside.
<br>
<br>
the problem is, i'm just letting everyone abuse my rights. abuse my feelings. abuse my life story.<br>
<br>
i can be a cold bitch just like you.
this world isn't worth the effort. it doesn't make a difference. no
body wants to follow in your footsteps.
i have no passion, no love, no drive, no adrenaline.
i'll just have to see what happens next.
i'm just going to wait for you to come and get me.</font>"

so i go to work on christmas, and im pretty hyped cause i just got a harmon/kardon amp that would win a beauty contest against tyra banks.
im still hyped even though i know that during the 5.5 hours that i work on christmas i dont get paid any extra. still minimum wage.dope.
doesnt matter. so over like 3 hours i make 75 cent tip, and im so stoked cause im so poor, and then this couple comes and they only have 3 dollars to get glosette raisins so i give them my tip and they're all like thanks blah blah and i'm like merry christmas.
slowly slowly i realize that as soon as soon these mother fuckers get their fucking presents, the christmas spirit disappears.
everyone was bitchy, everyone was rude, frustrated, back to their normal selves.
stupid fucks. then my boss has a fucking nervous breakdown and blames it all on us n00bsters. well maybe if you were paying us time and a half, or were at least nice to us from the first place, we'd be a little bit more motivated to be little famous players steam engines? yeah. i didn't think so. everyone is a bitch.
at least i got free milk duds. that made my night."

"event","well this is gonna be the best christmas ever.<br>
i was actually really exicted. i got all my presents.. wrapped them.. worked my ass off for them..<br>
1) eek kelton fight. like 3 days before the anniversary too. i thougth
i was a lucky girl. lucky to be that happy. karma kicked me in the ass.
i thought i was lucky. i thought i was <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">lucky.</span> 2 mother fucking days man. i couldnt be less lucky. <br>
well i cuold. but like.. gghghgigghi.<br>
2) not to mention i met this guy tanner a while ago and couldnt stop
thinking about him ever since. and he banged jazmin that night, i didnt
really care, but then he called me and tells me that he only remmebers
hanging out with me.. that he didnt even remember kissing her or
anything which i dont really believe but.. that im so pertty.. that he
loves me.. that im his sister.. hes just so funny and shit.. and he
called me the next day to chill but never called jazmin? i dont know. i
appreciate the fact that he might actually like me and not just want me
for ass. but i dont like ass users in general. i mean it says bush
hopping under hobbies. thats a couple days after i kinda figured he
might like me. cause he talked to me on msn and kept asking if i was
dating kelton.. and that ""now im interested"" when i said idk, and he
wants to chill like first day hes off grounding.. i dont know what it
is. is it physical? maybe. cause its not so much emotion, i dont know
him that well. kelton has a nicer body. not a nicer personality most of
the time but we connect better cause ive known him a billion times
longer. maybe i jsut need a break from kelton but that break wnt be for
like a month and a half. maybe i just need some action from someone
whos opinion i dont really care about that much? i wish i was skinny.
im going to try and lose weight forrealz. im not happy with myself at
all and its getting ridiculous. <br>
i never wrote in here, but my paernst and i were in a huge fight and i
was like fuck it and got my belly button pierced. im a dumbass and got
a hoop though, cause tia said to, and now its infected, its been over a
month and im cleaning it a lot and hoping to make it better really
soon. its so hard keeping it secret. and i feel badly about it too
because i never lie to my mom. but i like it so much. i dont know.<br>
i dont want to have a hoop in a piece of disgusting flab. ill be so happy with myself if i just lose some weight.<br>
3) i need to make more moneyyyyyyy i need so much stuff.<br>
4) i feel super neglected all the time lately. nothing fulfills me,
ever. i drink and smoke cigars a lot now. nto so much drink cause i
cant really. i feel like suicide again. i feel like depression again.
running away, hurting myself, dying, just sadness. its a horrible
ongoing feeling. a gun to my head seems comforting. and life seems
gross and disgusting.<br>
5) mariel isnt a lesbian if her and kelton can pretty much get it on and be bff.<br>
6) i guess zayn is perfect and i love him. we get a long really well
lately and we hang out lots. he makes me realyl happy. he's the one
thing in life i will not lose. i will sacrifice. i dont even give a
fuck. but of all people zayn i will keep. and im vowing to that. i will
try my best in this erlationship. i will not let him go.<br>
7) i hate this school and i want to leave. i want to be accepted in to
central so bad. i need to get good marks. its so hard. i cant stay
focussed or motivated. i need to do well on the finals. fuck.<br>
8) i want to curbstomp the next bitch on calgary transit.<br>
9) yet i feel so weak and powerless. im just small and angry. and upset.<br>
10) jack peaced. pretty much i guess.<br>
11) material objects make me happy because they last longer than most people do.<br>
for example, ive had this rubber container longer than i had mike, ive
had this pack of playing cards longer than i had jack, ive had a lamp
longer than i had jen.. it all works out. plus, when they break or stop
working, you can replace them easily, unlike with people.<br>
dope hey? i know.<br>"

"event","<font size=""2"">i saw her at a beauty salon<br>

rollers and dye but nothing fried, <br>

everything in the perfect porportion.<br>

my vision was distortion;<br>

what could i have said that would have been more clever.<br>

i turned a sharp corner down the street and my scarf swooshed in my face.<br>

it smelled like him. <br>

i didn't like the smell.<br>

in fact<br>

i cringed at the thought of your face, your voice, your name, and all the ways you've been hurting me lately.<br>

the snow was hard and squishy, and had turned a dull brown color,<br>

and i wondered who would have stepped on it and what kind of secrets they had.<br>

a lincoln navigator drove by and i was considering jumping in front of it.<br>

but i realized that all it would do was injure me and i probably wouldn't even end it.<br>

what if i choked on my taco? of if the reese's pieces got stuck in my esophogus? what would that feel like?<br>

i turned another sharp corner but this time my scarf fell off of my neck;<br>

before i could pick it up she did, and smiled a smile that just walked out of a fucking cosmopolitan magazine<br>

i wanted to strangle her, choke her with my scarf<br>

but i nodded and walked away as fast as i possibly could<br>

i walked back into the building after my time was up, and as usual
everytime that he walked by and i would look at him a mistake was made
whether it was dropping something or my whole heart.<br>

it was disgusting how attractive he was, how smooth, how gorgeous.<br>

if only i could afford a nose job.<br>

stupid genetics.<br>

stupid boy number one letting me down all the time.<br>

special.<br>

what does special feel like? was i ever special? maybe i was special when i was in the womb. maybe i'll be special after i die.<br>

maybe my art will sell for millions after i die, just like van gough, or monet, or lutherson, or dicaprio, or...<br>

or maybe i'll light my own apartment on fire and all my art will turn into ash.<br>

thanks a lot, boy.<br>

if you're fucking with this man, then you better be ready to get
stabbed in the stomach, the heart, the brain, every single tissue or
organ you can think of <br>

you better be ready to die inside. </font><br>"

"event","<font size=""2"">is it a b or c wanna tell me please?<br>

i think i have some sort of mental disease<br>

everything pisses the shit out of me, and sometimes i know why. maybe it's just the rage building up inside of me.<br>

or maybe, just like jen says, i'm just a teen</font><font size=""2"">anger with the typo fully intended.<br>

maybe i have nothing more than you, or the scenester over there,
standing with her bullet belt, bleached blonde hair and misfits hoodie.<br>

no piece of mind greater than you, or the dumbass that sits next to you in class.<br>
<br>

just because i'm angry, just because i'm pissed off it automatically means that my thoughts are stereotypical, pieces of shit.<br>

and you all wonder why we dont get along<br>
<br>

you wanna know why<br>
</font>


<font size=""2"">cause war is everywhere<br>
war is within every fucking household<br>
within every person<br>
within every imperfection in the pores of your fucking skin<br>

wanna know why we drop bombs on each other?<br>

cause we fucking <b>get ourselves involved</b> in each other's <b>buisness</b> when it's <b>not our's</b><br>

a country isn't democratic<br>

so Jesus gave you the right to step in and kill a bunch of innocent people<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

....i mean. it's just disheartening.<br>

i saw a girl on the internet a picture of the war in Iraq<br>

OMGZIEZ!! so yeah. i'm sorry that your american son died in the war. <br>

i really am. cause he probably didnt know what he was getting himself into.<br>

and you probably lured him into it with your bullshit propaganda in the first place, like you always always do..<br>

but you know what makes me just as sorry?<br>

the fact that this little girl<br>

this tiny, tiny girl who had so much ahead of her that we'll never know<br>

SHE WAS ONLY SEVEN YEARS OLD<br>

I'M PRETTY FUCKING SURE THAT SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TERRORISM LIKE.<br>

you know what makes me laugh and slap my knee<br>

i'm 14. I AM 14.<br>

i am double her age<br>
</font>



<font size=""2"">what the fuck gives me, or you the right to live double or more the age that she lived<br>
the fact that she was put here <br>
she came out of a uterus in order to LIVE her life<br>
she had the right to live<br>
she was put here to live<br>
JUST so that some selfish fucking idiot thought he had the right<br>
to blow her brains out<br>
and shrug his shoulders <br>
when he saw a picture of her father carrying her in his arms and sobbing a cry that none of us will ever be able to understand <br>

you ruined religion for me, how can i think of the Bible the same way
when now homosexuals get treated like shit just because the Bible said
so? i hate the way religion gets dragged into the fucking lives of
innocent people. just cause someone believes in something, and they
have more power, it's obvious that they can run the lives of other
people with those beliefs =)! equality my ASS.<br>
<br>

this doesn't even sound like an intellegent rant anymore.<br>

angry isn't intellegent, is it?<br>

nah.<br>

but it's wrong for me to cross the street in front of my school and
watch a guy tell us that Jesus is the answers to all our problems. how
he ""crosses"" out all of our ""sins"".<br>

i'm twisting and turning and i don't know what to do about it. <br>

i don't know what i am.<br>

i'm not aetheist. i still believe in a higher power.<br>

i'm just starting to become pretty damn sure that most of us don't believe in the same God. <br>

i mean, i like making mistakes. i LOVE making mistakes. as long as the
aftereffect is right. you're supposed to learn from your mistakes.
that's what life is all about. at least that's what i think.<br>

but i'm a teenager who knows nothing, right?<br>

right.<br>
<br>

and people<br>

people<br>

witty people<br>

cocky people<br>

pretty people<br>

ditzy people<br>

uneducated people<br>

ignorant people<br>

dishonest people<br>

disloyal people<br>

attention seeking people<br>

people just make me mad these days<br>

--whether it be the guy on the bus who's name i dont know, but he's
chewing his gum with his mouth open and squinting his eyes with his
Diesel jacket and spikey hair, and giving people weird looks, giving me
the vibe, i'm better than everyone else?<br>

--or the girl with her pink iPod mini who bitches everyone out after
she gets hit in the lip with a frizbee and cant even form a proper
sentence when she talks cause she's such a barbie like dumbshit?<br>

--or people who tell me what to do, who step on me like a little bug
and make me feel stupid instead of trying to help me, and when i do
something wrong, i apologize, but when they do something wrong, they
talk their bullshit 5 syllable words out of it so i end up still
apologizing?<br>

--people who lie about everything so they can get their way because
they're so jelous of the stupidest things - which they could personally
probably achieve if they stopped watching ""The OC"" and actually looked
around and realized not all Middle Eastern places are 'ghettos' and not
all natives are 'Lysol Drinkers'. so in the end they end up fucking up <i>your</i> life, your dreams, everything that you love, and throw it in the trash for you as the cherry on top of your life cream sundae?<br>

--or people who are immature as can be but in the end they talk so much
bullshit and intimidate you until you're just stuck rolling your eyes
and saying ""forget it"" because you just don't have the effort to hear
their crap anymore?<br>

--or PEOPLE who are your friend while they are in love with someone
else, and they talk about that person with you 24/7 and you have no
problem with it because you <i>love</i> this person. more than <i>anything</i>
in the whole world. your life being mapped out has them in every little
thumbtack. but then they stop liking that person, and suddenly you're
out of the picture. because this person was an egotistical fuck, who
doesnt care that your heart is ripped into a billion pieces while
they're laughing it up like the jackass they are?<br>

--or most of all, <i>most of all</i>
people who treat me like shit, lie to me, talk behind my back and say
things that make me cry but SOMEHOW, in the end i still end up looking
like a bitch, a ""vicious little thing""? well no shit, you treat me like
dirt and piss the fuck out of me, and then when i get mad at you, like
any normal person would it's like ""awwwwww im so sorry *tear*"" and im
still angry. and somehow, somehow you end up looking like the innocent
victim and i end up looking like a cunt?<br>
<br>

i'll hate some people even if i dont know them, i'll just look at them and think ""i fucking hate you. so much."" <br>

war is within my own mind<br>

i guess i cant blame world leaders for droppin' nukes on each other and taking AK47's to children<br>

cause the war<br>

the war is everywhere right?<br>

or maybe i'm just evil and vicious like you say<br>
<br>

kelton's mom thinks that i'm ""caring"" but that i shouldnt be so serious
about Kelton cause we're so young. and his parents really don't have an
opinion on me. it's just like ""rojin. yep.""<br>

wanna know why?<br>

UNDERESTIMATION. underestimation. oh she wont be with him for long.
they'll look back in 5 years or so and be like 'hey! remember that
middle eastern girl you used to date. what was her name? roshin?'
you'll end up with a nice little brunette of your own. funny, with long
batty eyelashes.she laughs at everything and takes nothing seriously.
cute little eyes. tits out, pants down, just like you wanted her.all of
you. <br>
<br>

am i just a pessimist? i fucking doubt it now. cause everything is dead
to me. everything. not because i'm a pessimist. because the rest of the
world is too ... ignorant. they see past all the death, the misery, the
immaturity, irrationality and live on with their lives. like.. i don't
even understand how i'm sitting here typing this while over there on
the same planet there's a bunch of people getting shot. <br>
<br>

not that there's anything that i can do about it. i'm only 14 <img src=""http://img0.img.nexopia.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"" alt="":)""> plus i'm middle eastern <img src=""http://img0.img.nexopia.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"" alt="":)""> and im a girl <img src=""http://img0.img.nexopia.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"" alt="":)""> and i'm a teenaNger. <img src=""http://img0.img.nexopia.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"" alt="":)""> <br>

bingo!<br>
<br>

i know, i know you tried to change things.<br>

but i don't know if i can take this anymore. no one wants it this way. <br>

i just need to get through this. i need nothing. i need nothing.<br>

i need to get out of here. i need to stop everything<br>

i need to put myself to rest<br>

stop the irregular heartbeats<br>

end these ""pessimistic"" thoughts. ""negative and dooming"" thoughts.<br>
<br>

right?<br>

haha. hey Bush. maybe i'm the <b>antichrist</b> or something.<br>

i mean it all <i>fits</i>. i was born in the <b>""axis of evil.""</b><br>

right?<br>
<br>

and you were there still, next to me, with a smile on your face that lights up the room<br>
<br>

do i even know you? who the fuck are you<br>

i'm finished with everything, we're not meant to contain the world's sadness<br>

goodbye to my passion and goodbye to my pain<br>

goodbye to my image and goodbye to this game<br>

i'll see you around someday or somehow<br>
<br>

i'll meet up with your sick ways again one day<br>

and you know<br>

it makes me sick to my stomach how i havent heard from you in a year<br>

my life would be perfect i swear if you were still in it<br>

its like i found life's meaning, didn't write it down and then forgot it over night<br>

i lost you over night </font>

"event","<font face=""tahoma"" size=""2"">i never quite noticed <br>
at what point or at what time you became so <i>ignorant</i> and cold<br>
when it was that your heart turned to stone<br>
when it was that you could laugh everything off like it didn't matter at all<br>
and yes, yes we were very good friends<br>
and i tried to do everything that i could<br>
<i>to make you happy</i><br>
it was quite odd, how i genuinely <i>cared</i> about you<br>
with every particle in my body i just wanted the <i>best</i> for you<br>
but in the end just like most relationships that i've witnessed in life<br>
it ended up somehow<br>
backfiring in my face.<br>
but with <i>you;</i><br>
with you<br>
i just <i>didn't</i> see it coming.<br>
maybe i wasn't paying enough attention<br>
maybe it was my fault that you felt this neglection<br>
<i>but either way</i><br>
<b>there can't be a rational point in existance<br>
that you had the right to do this to me.</b><br>
and now, now i've lost trust in every human soul<br>
and now, now the bond we had is no more<br>
and now, now you've lost a friend<br>
you've ruined a friendship<br>
<br>
because you didn't <i>think</i> first <br>
in the end,<br>
i hope that you enjoyed the slight, slow dance with the devil<br>
and all i have to say to you now is this:<br>
<u>in the future you best watch yourself</u></font><font size=""2""> </font><br>"

i love you, <i>jazmin</i>. you're pretty much the only person
that makes me feel appreciated and cared for. i feel like i'm actually
a good person when i'm around you and i feel like i'm headed somewhere
in this tangle of knots i call my life. thanks for boosting my
self-esteem. i owe you one.<br>
<i>jen</i>, i love you too. for sticking with me. we've had our
disputes but in the end i've learned so much just by hearing myself
talk to you and being proven wrong half the time. when i was away and
my life couldn't get any worse you stuck with me. i don't know if i'd
be the same person had you not come into my life. i miss you a lot
lately, and how close we used to be. but i guess there's nothing i can
do<br>
<i>kelton</i>, i love you half the time. we've been through a lot of
shit. but the fact that we actually worked our way around it and didn't
drop it all for trash makes me warm and tingley inside. thanks for
being there for me when i go crazy. thanks for actually being my
friend. </font>

"event","<font size=""2""><b>dope or not so dope. you decide, funk soul brother.</b><br>
<br>

it's halloween, jack jazmin rojin and kelton and kevin decide they're
going to get fucked. they go to 17th to kelton's brother's place to get
some vodka and end up with 2 bottles of it. happily they all go to
taryn's place and pick her up and go to a field and do their thing. <br>

kelton peaces it with kevin and then later taryn peaces.<br>

it's hard for rojin to even take a shot because she had alcohol
poisoning. in this case it was especially hard because the alcohol
poisoning that occurred over a month ago took place with a hell of a
lot of, well, vodka.<br>

anyways, jack rojin and jazmin decide to go to the bus stop. jazmins
having a hard time but hey.. jazmin always has a hard time they think.
she falls a little bit, laughs a little bit. they're sitting on the
bench, jazmin seems fine until.. suddenly she falls over and knocks
rojins precious pepsi off the bench. (thankfully not the vodka.. but
still. darn you, jazmin.)<br>

jack and rojin slowly come to realize (rojin slower than jack) that
there is no way that jazmin will be able to get on a bus. and things
don't start getting prettier there. as jack and rojin struggle to get
jazmin through a field, a pink panther ringtone goes off and rojin
realizes she's in shit. why? well because rojin's dad is practically
legally insane and will kill her if he finds out she's on 17th. <br>

even though the oh so brilliant jack is drunk, he comes up with a story
that seems to be enough to work. kelton calls and asks if he should
sneak out and rojin says no because she's worried about him getting the
shit kicked out of him by his psychotic mother. rojin has to peace
eventually after smoking a bit of a cigar with jack trying to unstress.
she sneaks into taryn's house, praying that within the next 10 minutes
jack will have been able to drag jazmin into the other field to give
her time to sober up.<br>

unfortunately, as rojin exits the house she sees the two figures pretty much in the same spot as before. <br>

as soon as rojin enters her dad's honda, he smells the smell of captain
blacks and alcohol and starts saying a whole bunch of shit that lowers
rojin's poor quality self esteem. but no fear! kelton soon calls rojin
and distracts her father from his bitching. speaking in code, she
informs him that they are in the field in front of taryn's in the midst
of this battle between ... well.. carrying a drunk girl i shall say. <br>

rojin goes home, worried out of her mind and the thoughts begin.<br>
<br>

should i have stayed with her? no.. i mean, what would that accomplish?
my dad would find me in the end and kick my ass, and not let me even
get to help her. then i would never be allowed to hang out with her
again because my dad would never let me leave the house again ever
again. then kelton calls me and says they're taking jazmin to Rori's
and that idea in general was good because she'd be safe but at the same
time triggers insane waves of paranoia through my mind.<br>

am i blowing things too out of porportion? i mean, she's just drunk that's all. she should be okay, right?<br>

wait.. am i a bad person? am i a bad friend? does he like her? does the
other guy still like me and is just saying that it was a while ago?
what the hell does love mean? what if during the summer he really did
cheat on me? what if she doesn't breathe? what if she dies? what if he
dies? what if his mom finds out and slits his throat? where the hell is
jack?<br>

then they turn into even more irrational things.<br>

why is (blank) such a bitch? why does she think she's better than
everyone. why does she think that she's better than me and has a right
to treat me like a 3 year old kid. you know, she used to be my friend.
my best friend. i loved her. look at her now. what a fucking bitch.<br>

why did (blank) betray my sorry ass? why did he leave me to die out
here? what the hell was this all about? it's like something just
suddenly was taken out of the picture and the whole thing fell apart
and now it's impossible for things to be okay again. why the fuck did
that happen? who took it out? why did they take it out? will they ever
put it back? can i ever just forget?<br>

why is (blank) such a motherfucking prick? why did he say that shit
about me? i didn't deserve that. am i honestly that bad of a person? am
i just a girl who goes out with someone for almost a year but is just
playing them? really? is that how i'm coming off? is that my ugly side,
my grotesque side?<br>
<br>

it was just one of those nights you wish you had a gun so you could turn off all these things going on inside your head.<br>

but there was no gun. there were no sleeping pills either to shut up my membranes.  <br>
<br>

but mostly one thing that hit me.<br>

is.<br>
<b>how come whenever i'm the villain everyone is on my ass<br>
but when i'm the victim<br>
no one seems to give a shit</b><br>

it doesn't really matter, y'know. <br>

i can put MY ass on the line for you, but you won't give a fuck if i'm
dying out here or if i just need someone to tell me that my existance
is cared about by SOMEBODY in this world.<br>

no one will be there when i'm the victim again.<br>

so why should i EVER give a shit. <br>

i should just be ignorant and fucked up like you.<br>

it'd be so much easier, wouldn't it?&nbsp;</font>"

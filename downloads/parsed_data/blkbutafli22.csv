Even smiling is hard.&nbsp; I'm surprised that I got any homework done today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000>Today was a day doomed from the start, I should have known.&nbsp; I was angry at myself from the time I woke up for reasons I choose to keep to me.&nbsp; But I was mad at me and therefore in a bad mood.&nbsp; And then things just kept deteriorating.&nbsp; God spoke to me the obvious and it made me even more ashamed of me.&nbsp; Plans that I really needed to happen got broken because of stupid drama.&nbsp; People are mad at me because I don't want to go somewhere that I would be a complete drag at anyway.&nbsp; (That sentence didn't make any sense at all)&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, that last part is me&nbsp;trying to be nice to my friends and save themn my horrible mood, but making them mad despite my&nbsp;efforts.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000>Basically today I just make myself sick.&nbsp; And everyday lately.&nbsp; Like, my entire persona just makes me want to vomit sometimes.&nbsp; I know that sounds weird, but that's the way it is so that's the way I'll tell it.&nbsp; There are so many things about me that disgust me and that I wish I could change but I know I can't so I guess I can just deal.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000>I'm stopping now. There's no reason that people should read all of my whining.</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Good morning everyone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>So I had an interview this morning.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun, lemme tell ya.&nbsp; I answered some things kind of not the way I wanted to, but that always happens in important interviews.&nbsp; If I'm meant to get it I will, if I'm not I won't.&nbsp; Simple as that.&nbsp; I'm doing all I can to just leave this in God's hands.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;never been very good at just giving things up to Him, but I know that's what I must do; about this and about other things in my life as well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Yesterday Sam came in and talked about how much she's going to miss Jenna next year now that she's a sorority girl.&nbsp; I was thinking about that myself.&nbsp; It just seems strange to think that Jenna and I won't be as close as we have been, but I think we both know it is inevitable.&nbsp; We have been best friends for so long and I can't imagine what things will be like without her as my best friend.&nbsp; I mean, I know we will still be friends and close, atleast I hope so. And I'd like to think that we will be best friends forever as we constantly claim.&nbsp; But our lives look to be going in different directions next year.&nbsp; It's hopeful because we are both getting closer to our individual dreams but its scary because I want to share life with her like we always have.&nbsp; I don't know how she feels about all that.&nbsp; It's just that we've been through our hardest crap together.&nbsp; And sometimes we treat each other like crap but it's all out of love and PMS so it's all good.&nbsp; And we just compliment each other so well.&nbsp; So all this to say that it will be strange next year, but I hope that nothing will pull us too far apart.&nbsp; We always agreed that we'd never let boys or other people break us apart but we never took life into account.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Okie doke, it's about that time for classes and stuff.&nbsp; Lucky I only have two today.&nbsp; I think I will just chill for the rest of the day after class.&nbsp; Very little homework involved in chilling. :)&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>much luv*</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#3366ff>I am so bored right now.&nbsp; And I have been pretty much since this semester started.&nbsp; It was nice during the first semester because I was just getting used to everything and the little free time I had was great.&nbsp; But this semester all of the sudden it seems like I have so much free time.&nbsp; I feel like I should be doing something and getting things accomplished but I already have.&nbsp; I'm going to be mad when I do badly in my classes when I've had all this time to study.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I do is look forward to next year when I'll have my car and a job and I'll be able to pledge and everything.&nbsp; I know that's sad so waste time this year thinking of next year.&nbsp; I'm doing my best to enjoy the right now but it's really hard when it is just so darn boring.&nbsp; I can't believe I'm craving the responsibilities that next year will bring.&nbsp; I know that next year I will be cursing them.&nbsp; But that's okay.&nbsp; I'm ready for it, atleast I think I am.&nbsp; I ready for the responisibilities.&nbsp; I'm ready to whine about them and then get used to them.&nbsp; I'm sick of being a spoiled brat, not by choice but by situation--if that makes any sense at all.&nbsp; I'm an only child and I'm craving some independence!&nbsp; I know that I'm going to mess up and I'm so ready just to get passed all of that and be completely on my own two feet.&nbsp; Yes it's scary but it's exciting at the same time. I guess it's just that the freedom of going off to college is stale and I'm ready for a little more.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, that's all for right now I suppose.&nbsp; I'm sorry that these are so boring.&nbsp; Maybe you should try doing your homework or something instead of reading my journal:) Unless you're like me and are already ahead on your homework because you have nothing else to do at all.&nbsp; Much luv.</FONT></P>"

"event","Hi!  You must be extremely bored to be reading my journal.  But that's cool, cuz i noticed I have a lot of free time in order to actually keep an online journal as well as my own private journals.  So that's kool I guess.  Or pathetic.  I haven't decided yet.
So yeah, I'm just starting on this journal obviously.  Really there is nothing on my mind today.  I am just thinking about my friends generally and their individual potentials and the special gifts each of them have to offer.  I know that's strange to just be randomly thinking about, but I actually think about that alot.  When I see people it's weird because I see them for who they could be, not really for who they are.  And sometimes that makes who they are at the moment, or, rather, who the rough times they are going through are making them out to be, and it breaks my heart. (Wow, that was a confusing and most likely grammatically incorrect sentence.  Go back and reread it, just to be sure.) But I realize sometimes it's hard to see things from the inside.  And that's why I must work on my patience and compassion.  Baby steps:)
Okay, so much for the first entry.  You like?  Maybe next time I'll get all selfish--as usual--and tell alittle about myself.  Maybe not. :)"

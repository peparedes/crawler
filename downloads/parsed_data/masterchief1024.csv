"event","Today was a bad day
i had a math test and i'm grounded because i tried calling imasillygirl at 2 am her time and my mom found out so now i cant call without my moms permission.

life really sucks and i hate it
the only hope is seeing imasillygirl at camp or getting my birthday present from her.  by the way she's late with it.  My b-day was in october.

thats it for now!"

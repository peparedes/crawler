"event","Your horescope for April 2nd, 2005
Diana,
You might expect to find a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, for the mists of illusion are all around you now. Unfortunately, you're going to have to pay attention today, for if you don't respect boundaries, by tomorrow you'll be regretting your lack of self-restraint. And the rainbow could very well disappear. Rely on reality instead of your dreams."

"event","""Sometimes I lie awake at night and ask myself 'why me?' Then a voice answers, 'Nothing personal, your name just came up."" -Charlie Brown 

     So I don't really know what to write about or where to start or anything. I don't think anything will help me figure out what's going on in my life right now. I'm tired of being lied to and used and lonely. I could talk about it until I'm blue in the face and I still wouldn't say everything I want to say. Josh says that he gives up on me because I try to be tough and don't open up. Maybe he's right. For those few of you that actually bother to care... I'm not worth the effort. I don't give a fuck anymore... about school, about my family, about my friends, about just fucking life. The only reason I'm going to school right now is to take up my time... while I'm getting some money together... and then I'm out of here, and I'll be damned if I ever come back to Parma again. So don't bother worrying about me, don't waste the effort. I'll just end up being a dissapointment to everyone, and Lord knows I know what its like to be disappointed. Not a good feeling. Especially when that's all that you have in your life. In a few years, I'll be long gone and long forgotten, and it'll be for the best. Everyone will be better off, and maybe I will too. It's just not worth it, the way everything is now... This can't be all that's out there."

"event","So.... I'm bored.. .and I was in a creative mood, but not so creative... so I thought I'd share some poems that I wrote a long time ago... one about WWI... for a class.. and the other one just for no reason.  The one is going into a BW book thingie of different stories and poems and stuff, so I thought I'd share with my friends before sharing with the whole world.  They're pretty crappy, but its fun anyways.  

Lost

I knew a young boy
Who grinned at life in simple ecstasy
A boy of nineteen who flirted with beauties in the park
Making mischief of a young boy
All too soon the hands of his brokenhearted girl are empty

War is the total pain of millions of parted loved ones - some for always

The dawn breaking, the sky filling with light
The trumpets filling the air
The new young soldier lays on the freshly dewed grass
Staring across the morning, heavy with fog
Not knowing what tomorrow brings

War is the impossibility of planning a future
Uncertainty that mocks every hoping dream

The soldier boy prays
As his weary hands carry wounded comrades
Over bloody battlefields
The ghostly cries of wounded echo through the front

War is the many precious years of human life lost

The soldier boy watches as his companion fights for his life
Bitterness sweeping through him
He was young, he hated the war
How should he die as he wrong prevails

Death chose him, and he went
The cruel evening became silent
Then - far away, the gentle boom of a rifle

War is the corpse of a friend;
One moment ago a living human being
With thoughts, hopes, and a future
Now only a memory

The soldier boy hangs his head
Not to daunt the coming twilight
He whispers:
""You did not die in vain.""

That was the WWI one.. I must add... I know that a lot of you are not going to like my poems... they're not anti-war... I don't mean them to be, its just looking at it from people's perspectives not from the basic idea of it.  I do think that there is a just cause for certain wars, but there are people and families to think about.   ANYways.... this is my other one... I like this one better

Fallen Angels

They crave to be safe at home surrounded by love
They pray to God that they don't die
Each day that passes, they long to be safe in their haven 
They have not experienced life yet, 
Now they will pay the greatest debt

Shattered Dreams
No longer have wings 

The night sky is on fire
The lives of boys who dreamed of glory
Forever tainted
Not knowing what becomes of tomorrow
Fighting the exhaustion that threatens to overcome
Vivid memories flash before their eyes

Shattered Dreams
No longer have wings

They were told to fight, and they shall be free
As rain streams from the sky
Sanity slipping fast
Another shot is fired
They long to be safe in the arms of loved ones
Enveloped in the smells of sweet perfume and freshly baked pie
They wonder how a freedom
Can make the bravest of men run in fear
In wars such as this who is to say who won or lost
Men will die, widows will cry
When will this end?

Shattered Dreams
No longer have wings

As my companions fall
A tear slides down my cheek
For Shattered  Dreams
No longer have wings
Souls abandoned
A soldier's glory missed"

"event","umm.... so yeah. Fuck school. I'm just going to stop going now. It's not worth my parents spending all the money when its just not happening. I actually love my history class... as I do all my history classes, but what would I do with that. It sucks... why do some people know exactly what they want to be. They go into college, knowing without a doubt exactly what they like, what they want to do with the rest of they're lives. There's so much out there, how can I just pick one thing and do it for the rest of my life. There is nothing out there that interests me like that... except singing, but well -- I'm not good enough... well, that about ends that debate. I hate that my parents keep pushing me towards making that decision. Who's life is it... mine or theirs?? Its not my fault that they never finished school or did what they wanted to do with their lives. Another thing that sucks.... anything that I actually do want to do.... music or history, there's no future in that. Why can't I just be good at science and math where all the good jobs are. No, I have to be fucked up and like things that aren't real jobs unless you get a PhD. Another fucked up thing... PhDs. Why the fuck would I want to stay in school for half of my life. What is that going to do for me. Do you really learn that much more going to school for eight more years than everyone else just for the fucking title of doctor. By then you're old and gray and since you've been going to school all your life you didn't have time to marry, so you're old gray and lonely. Great life I got ahead of me. My dad used to play me in the game Old Maid, and usually he would let me win, but when I started getting older he got harder on me so I would lose and he'd laugh and say I was the Old Maid. What if that's just my destiny. I'm done. I can't make this decision. How can I possibly plan the rest of my life at the age of 18. It's just not possible. What if I get a degree, and then there's no jobs in the field. Then I'm screwed. Its stupid. Why can't we all just go back to farming or something. 
Some times I feel that people are just waiting for me to fuck up. Like... they see me and they're just thinking... ""wow... she sucks at life, that girl's not going anywhere"". Sometimes, you just see it in people's eyes even though they won't say it. It doesn't matter to me, I guess, I just think people should look at themselves before judging me. 
I mean... my life isn't SO terrible... I have some good friends, and they get me through a lot, but they're always screwed too... I just wonder... is it always going to be me and my friends that get the shaft. Why us.... why not the assholes. Why is it that the nice, funny, down to earth people get fucked. Why are we the ones with fucked up family lives and the no luck love lives. It doesn't seem fair. I know... life's not fair, but why not. It sucks. Friends. They're a funny thing. I love them much, but it really sucks when they disappoint you. Especially the ones you never expected. Lately, I don't know, I just feel like I'm in the way. More than usual. Like I'm an expendable resource. ""Well, I guess talk to/hang out with Diana for a bit, until someone better come along..."" Which, I guess I can't blame them. I don't really have much to say anymore. It's like... I'm not part of anything anymore. 
The fact that Valentine's Day is on the way... not making me too happy either. It's just another day, but... its still there, out to depress people like me who don't have anyone. At least I'm not in high school with all the damn pink, and flowers and chocolate for everyone but me... no.... that sucks, I don't mean to bitch about that, I'm happy for those people that they found someone that they like... its just a little ""rub it in my face"" kinda thing sometimes. Things just haven't been right for a long time.  I keep saying that I'm going to start over... I think its time to do that. Yes... that's what I'm going to do. New beginnings. New everything, with everyone. We'll see what comes of that. 

An appropriate song... I'm not too big a fan of ""new"" Green Day, but I like this song a lot, mostly for its sentimental value, and like the song says... sometimes I wish someone out there will find me, until then I walk alone. I'm ok with that. Content is a good word for it. I'm content. 

""Boulevard Of Broken Dreams""

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
and I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah,
Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah
Ah-ah, Ah-ah

I walk alone
I walk a...

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone..."

"event","So.... break has been over for a week, but it just seems like its ending now for me because everyone left me. So I'm going to overview my break. My break was.... actually pretty good. I spent the first part of it working... .a LOT... and Rudy's sucks, but its cool. Rudy's is hilareous though, its always interesting to be there. Everything's shifting there... and Danielle is cleaning out Euge's stuff.... and oh boy some of the stuff she found. Lol... apparently she found a dead mouse in the back of the room and Janet freaked out.... but nobody is as scared of mice as Julie. She won't even go downstairs into the basement because she thinks there are mice there. So Danielle and Janet... being two of the adults of the place.... took the dead mouse and put it in a box. Then Danielle was like... Julie can you help me with some of these boxes, and has Julie get the one with the mouse. Julie picks it up, looks inside, all that's in there is the mouse and she throws the box in the air and screams MOTHERFUCKER!!! Then she proceeds to swear up a storm... you stupid bitch I hate you, fuck.... as customers are walking in. Danielle was laughing so hard she couldn't even finish the story. So add that to my adventures at Rudy's. Oh yeah.... DEANNA was FIRED!!! What a sweet sweet world this is. Rudy's is extra pissing me off right now, cause they hired a new girl already and I have to work with her the next two weeks cause Christy is off.. which would be fine, if it wasn't Friday and Saturday.. which I have piano and CYM on those days. It sucks. 
My favorite part of break??? The fact that I didn't have to hang out with anyone I didn't like. Well except New Years, but I quickly got over that when everyone was making fun of her. That was great. I spent a lot of time with Tamara... especially when Nina was here... and that was fun, Nina is a cool girl and I'm glad I met her. I miss her... east coast is so damn far away... especially since you've lived walking distance from me all my life. We always know how to have fun, even if it means skipping out on church and playing poker on Christmas eve. There were a few Denny's trips with Abby, Danielle, Jen O'Malley.... gotta love the Denny's trips. 
I loved that I got to spend time with Bails because I don't see her that often while she's at school... though I'm going to try to come up to Kent more often this semester because I miss spending time with her, Circus Atari.... nothing will ever beat it, that guy being smooshed and kicking his feet in the air, that was the most hilareous thing, except maybe the dog that chased your car later that night. It was great hanging out with Josh, Shane, and Bails.... because, as Bails said, they are the people I feel most comfortable around. I can tell them anything... and we always have an awesome time even if its just sitting at Denny's for hours upon end. Especially when we're picking on Josh. I know them probably better than I know myself and vice-versa. I love you guys, just wanted you to know that, thanks for staying close. So yeah, pretty much my break was uneventful, but I like it the way it was. 
So my new semester has started... I'm taking a History of Russia class and its pretty cool, a lot like Ukie school right now, which is great. I have an 8 in the morning math class... who does that.... and I just don't know what's going on. Well.. I guess I would if I was awake... but whatever. I'm taking a personal wellness class, whatever the fuck that is.... its basically health class that's mandatory... and just for the ""minimester"" or 7 weeks. Since I was thinking about majoring in buisness I figured I should take a buisness class.... so I took management... its ok... all next week we're watching Office Space, which is a hilareous movie. I have an evening class.... Industrial/Organizational Psychology.... I've only been to one so far, but its pretty much buisness... just with a psych title... it was my advisors last attempt to keep me as a psych major (which doesn't look like its going to happen). Ha... that's my usual wednesday right there. I dont' have the I/O pysch class on Mon or Fri. My last class is my only Tuesday/Thursday one.... its.... dun dun dun... physics. My professor is crazy. He looks like a hippie... with this long ass beard and long hair that he pulls into a ponytail and these really thick glasses. The way he talks too... He makes me laugh. That class I think is going to be a little challenging... especially to stay awake in. I dont know if I'm going to be able to handle relativity and quantum theory and all that jazz. The fact that he spells the word phenomenon on the board phenomenom... I don't know... but yeah. Schedule isn't that bad. It's just that this week went by like a freaking month. I always hate spring semester... it goes by so slow. I can't wait till summertime. Well... anyways... I think this is enough ramblings for one day, just trying to catch up because I haven't written in a while. Peace out...."

"event","Dear Diana,
Here is your horoscope
for Monday, December 27:

If you need to fall apart, go ahead. You're among friends with soft shoulders and sound advice. Acts of comfort could become destructive habits if repeated too often. Don't squander your strength in a weak moment. 
Extended Horescope:
You may feel somewhat dissociated today, as if you're watching yourself from a distance. This discontinuity between mind and body can be disconcerting, but it can also be a fascinating exercise if you attempt to see yourself from an objective view. You are feeling fragile, though, and the least show of opposition -- particularly if it comes from someone you don't much like -- could elicit an emotional response that is wildly out of proportion to the action.

What does this mean... it's probably best to stay clear of me today.  Though Erika, Tamara and I had fun at the mall.  BTW, Thanks Bails for agreeing with me.  Now I don't feel so alone.  So last night was PRETTY interesting.  

Man... I had an interesting night last night... Bailie called me and we're like... we're going to do something.  So we went to TGIFridays for soup and dessert (ha ha).  We saw Ben Dieball there... and he's still a little strange... all he said was hi, which was probably for the best.  Then some rowdy girls spilled all this stuff everywhere, and a couple were being rediculous and holding hands the whole time... I guess I'm just a bitter person, but enough is enough.  Then we went over Bailie's house and were going to watch a movie... but the DVD player wouldn't work, and it was funny watching Autumn try to fix it.  So we settled on playing Atari.  It was totally awesome.  Our favorite game was Circus Atari... it was hilareous... there were two things bouncing and you would have to catch it on the board and send it shooting up into the bricks.. and if you missed it fell and made a crashing noise and wiggled it's feet.. it was so funny.  We started naming who each person we dropped was.  That was even more amusing.  Then Autumn brought out her smores maker and we made smores.  Smores and Atari.. what more can a girl as for.. ha ha.  When I got home, Bailie was online... so we made up a quiz about our night which everyone has to take... 
Take the Diana and Bailie Quiz....
1.  True or Ture: Diana and Bailie were chased by a dog this evening.
2. True or Ture: The dog ate Bailie
3. Multiple Choice: 
    Tonight Diana and Bailie were playing:
  a. Super Mario Brothers
  b. DDR
  c. Circus Atari
  d. Halo 2
4.  Diana and Bailie were making:
  a. popcorn
  b. easy mac
  c. peanut butter and jelly
  d. smores
5.  What is the correct phrase to use when playing warlords:
  a.  ""stay away from me castle""
  b. ""AHHH""
  c. ""that looks like a sperm""
  d. ""foo stop blowing up ma cribizzle""
I already gave away most of the answers, but that's ok.. it was funny anyways. 
Then, at about 2 in the morning my phone rings.  Lol.. it was Yuri... and he was drunk.  I always  get drunk dialed... that means people must really like me, that makes me feel special.  He's like... Diana.. will you marry me?? Which reminded me of someone else... anyways.  Why does everyone want to marry me??  Well... except the guys I want.  Whatever.  Yuri was telling me how the guys took him to a strip club.  Mike happend to be online.. so I started talking to him wondering if he was trashed too... but he wasn't.  So we started playing with Yuri's head... and Mike's like... Yuri fell in love with a stripper.  I asked Yuri about it and he's like... hell no I didn't fall in love with her... she took $25 from me.. .she ripped me off.  Overall an eventful night.  It was a good time.  But tonight, I'm pretty bored... obviously.. so I'm going to search for something to do. Maybe I'll write later... if not... Goodnight"

"event","So I have a little venting to do... and I don't feel like I really have anyone to vent to right now. I'm just a little bit irritated by people right now. This has been building for a while, so its going to come out right now. This is not directed at any one person... and I'm not trying to lecture anyone. I just wish that some people would think before they speak sometimes. I'm going to give you the two topics of conversation that I tend to find offensive, and would really appreciate it if they could be avoided. If anyone has a problem with any of this, you are more than welcome to ask me about my explaination. 

1. Any topics that have to do with the consumption, smoking, or injection of hard drugs like heroin, crack, any other street drugs.. or drugs that are perscription that are sold on the street. Drugs are not a funny subject. I'm sorry to those of you that find it funny... I don't, because I have a personal issue with them. How about people ODing from drugs.... having to go to the hospital or dying from them. Is that funny too?? Have you ever seen someone ODing from heroin? People that smoke pot are ok, its not a hard drug, and they tend to make me laugh when they are high... not to say I think its good to smoke pot, I don't. If you do, that's your choice. I know its kind of a double standard, but other drugs bother me. I've witnessed it first hand more than once... I'm not going to get into it. You're a pretty sick child if you find that funny. 

2. Cancer. It's not funny. Not by any means. There is no way to take that subject and make it funny, no matter what you think. If you think it's funny, please talk to someone who has cancer, who's going through chemo, who has a family member going through it, or knows someone that has died from it. If someone has a problem with this... please... tell me, I'll be more than willing to elaborate. Believe me... its not funny. 

I know its pretty vague.... but the issues that I have with these subjects are personal, and I don't exactly want to post it all over the internet, so please... if there's any kind of issue with the problems I have with these subjects, I will have no problem explaining myself ~ UkiCutie4e is the sn. Go ahead, whine all you want about my being a bitch or whatever because I posted this... but I have my reasons. I understand that some people handle their problems through making jokes... but there are some things that aren't to be joked about. 

On a more pleasant note... MERRY CHRISTMAS... yesterday I chilled over my cousin's house... just me and him. We watched Sienfeld, and it was cold because his heater was broken and he couldn't light a fire... too bad he wasn't a boyscout. Today I went over my chocha Marika's house... and was attacked by the boys as usual. Later a whole crapload of people showed up, and I was playing house with the two cutest kids ever... Alya who was 2 and Andrijko that was 1. They were absolutely adorable. I can't even stand how cute they were I wanted to take them home. Their mom wants me to babysit... and of course I said yes... so I'm excited. I saw Danylo for the first time in a long time, so that was cool... and I was chillin with Teresa for a while. I was a little tipsy from the wine.. don't really like wine too much. That may be where all this bitching came from. I still believe it no matter what though. Anyways...its late and I think I'm going to sleep. Goodnight and MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
Diana"

"event","So I just had a special day today. So I was awakened by Tamara who's like... uhh, I need socks. So she came over at like... 9 to get socks and we had doughnuts that Shane gave me and orange juice. Then my dad made me shovel the snow which was a bitch... really sucked. Then I showered and around 2:30 I got ready for work and went to warm up my car. Then I locked my keys in my car as I was wiping it off. I'm a genius. My dad couldn't find the other set of keys, which was great. So 3:15ish I finally get to work and they're all teasing me about being late. 15 minutes no big deal. Later that afternoon I look at the calandar, and I'm like.. shit, I was supposed to be in at 12. Wow I'm a genius. I kept thinking today was wednesday, but it was really thursday. I'm special. Work was uneventful, you know how it is. Then my dad took me to get my Christmas present (blinds woohoo) and then I went over Tamara's. My next special moment for the day... I took all ofd these clips that we all used to wear in our hair and put them all over my head.... put her ""God's Eye"" around my neck and this weird gingham skirt that was obviously from like... kindergarten around my leg caus ethat's as far as it would fit. It was interesting. We were crazy. Then Abby called and we decided to go to Denny's, so I picked up Josh, Danielle and Abby and we went up there. I guess I wasn't very talkative... I was just thinking about stuff around here... and some of the subjects were hitting me hard a little too close to home, so yeah. Sorry guys. It's always a pick me up to go out with them though. Now... I'm bored. Let me tell you about what I'm doing now. Well I can't.. cause it has to do with Josh Gatka's Christmas present... but I will say that I'm a special special girl and he is going to love opening this. After he opens it I'll talk about it. Ha ha. But my being extremely bored with explain. well I'm sleepy i think I'm going to go watch my movie. I wish I was more of a talker sometimes, dump everything on everyone else. Its not a bad think sometimes. ANyways... GOODNIGHT"

"event","So I have three papers to write, and its customary for me that when I have a paper to write I ignore the fact that I have any such thing and update my journal instead.  Two more days of class and then finals... thank the Lord.  I'm so happy.  So Tamara and I were just talking about relationships.  ha ha.  Not my strong suit.  I've figured out that I can't commit to things.    That's why I don't have a boyfriend.  It's not because guys don't like me... (though it would help if they did) but its because I am terrified of committing to a guy. Why? I don't know.  So we were discussing... can a person forget how to kiss??  Or is it like... riding a bike or something, and you just don't forget.  Tamara says once you're in the heat of the moment you'll remember again.  Cause I'm sure out of practice.  Ha ha... I almost remember the last guy I made out with... Tamara and I figured out that... well we think his name was Taras Andrusiv.  I'm almost positive.  It was at Ellenville... so I'm not too sure.  I think that's what I miss most... kissing.  Kissing and just cuddling together on the couch watching tv... or getting a massage... or just being able to sit in a comfortable silence.  There's only a few people that I've ever been able to have comfortable silences with.. and that's why they're my best friends.  Ha ha... I can't believe I'm considering posting this.  Hey... what have I got to lose... just a little dignity.  Its ok... I have no shame anymore... I miss kissing.  Anyways... I'm gonna go write my paper or go to sleep whichever comes first.  Goodnight"

If a loved one needs you,<br>you are always right at his or her heels! Your<br>deep social connection with human beings<br>produces your qualities of genuine caring and<br>charisma.  However, at times you are naive to<br>the true nature of your loved ones.  Remember<br>that humans' gift of free will does not always<br>lead them in wise directions.  But your essence<br>of love and friendship represent the other<br>precious gifts of humanity. Overall you are a<br>strikingly valuable and innocent being who has<br>a lot to give.(please rate my quiz cuz it took<br>me for freaking ever to create)

"event","In psych class for the past three days we've been watching the movie Stand By Me.  I love that movie.  For anyone who doesn't know it... its actually a Stephen King story, but not normal scary creepy undead Stephen King.  It was actually a normal story... about a twelve year old kid and his three friends who go on a journey to find a dead body of a boy and how they bonded and stuff.  Its a really cute movie... even with its cheezy 80s motif, and like so many other 80s movies its based in the 50s so it has some jammin tunes, ha ha.  As a plus it has Corey Feldman before he became a dork as a crazy kid and Kiefer Sutherland pre-24 days.  My favorite by far... River Phoenix.... not only was he little Indiana Jones, a Marine in Dogfight, have an awesome name, and lived a rock star life (OD'd at the age of 23), but he was pretty cute... and in the movie he's a tough guy, but you definitely get the soft side.  I love the bad boys with a soft side.  
     Then I went to ""You suck cause you're an American"" class where I learned more about how Americans are stupid, uncultured people, how Malasians have to know many languages, and how Malasians are cultured because they hear Muslims sing prayers every morning even if they're not Muslim, and how Americans are racist.  Bullshit... look who's racist.  I don't sit around and talk about how other cultures are uncultured or how I'm better than everyone because I'm  American.  Fucking imperialist.  Then people wonder why I hate learning about Asian cultures. I don't like learning about Asian cultures.  I hate that she says that she's Malasian-Chinese like I'm supposed to bow down to her.  Just because she knows five languages and I know two doesn't make her more cultured than me.  I think America is more cultured.... in Malasia, they do what the Malasians do, in China they do what the Chinese do... in America they do all of that.  Every family can celebrate what holidays they want, and follow what traditions they want.  Sure there are people who don't follow any traditions, but that's what they want... and they can do what they want unlike in Communist China where they'll be quietly extinguished because they don't agree with the government and Chinese traditions.  I'm not in that class to learn about how much my country sucks because we're uncultured, I'm there to learn about music.  I don't understand her either, and she gets pissed cause we don't, but that's another story.  You know what I say to that... she can take your Chinese-Malasian, five language speaking culture... and shove it.  Sorry to anyone I've offended, I'm just tired of her racist badmouthing of white people.   
     Then I had World Civ... and we learned about the Holocaust again, another thing I'm not going to get into.  Then I came home, bitched my sister out cause she pissed me off, took a nap.  Then I drove back to school, went online for a bit where I found out Joshua thinks I'm a cynic, then went to kickboxing where Dan, aka(by me) Billy Banks, kicked my ass, and I was dead tired and my legs felt like jello.  After that I went to the Kashtan board meeting... aren't I a joiner.. this is the rest of my life... meetings.  Great.  I'm definitely putting off the ten... yes TEN papers that I have to write in the next three weeks... that is SO many... and its not like... one page here, one page there... these are hard core papers.... and at least two for each class, some three.  Its not just me putting it off either... I couldn't write them till I saw the play and the concert... so it totally sucks.  I hate the end of the semester, but I'm so happy its heading towards the end of the semester cause I don't know how much more of this I can handle.  
    Another thing....  I love reading Lesya Ukrainka, because she was such a... how do I put it... I don't know, she was a strong willed woman, and I respect that.  Camp a few years ago was named after one of her most famous poems: in latin...""Contra Spem Spero""  translated to Bez Nadiyi Spodivayus, or Hope Against All Hope.  She battled tuberculosis of the bones for a majority of her life, but still had hope for herself, for people, for her country.  She wrote some kick ass poetry... including Tamara's away message quote from Lisova Pisnya (Forest Song) which was probably the most inspiring quote I've ever heard to me. The quote says ""Ya v sertsi mayu te, shcho ne vmyraye.""  That means so much to me right now.  It has so many meanings, ha ha Cathy's interpretation is awesome, and it can mean different things to different people, and it can affect anyone in a meaningful way.  Since I read that quote, I think it changed my perspective on a lot. I remember when I played Lesya Ukrainka in some Mykolaj play that we did for CYM and I sang a song with her lyrics.  Now I look back and read those lyrics, and they could never have meant that much to me then as they do now.   She was one kickass girl, let me tell you.  Anyways, I think I'm gonna get started on some of my essays... I'll write soon.  Goodnight"

"event","So earlier today I was sitting in the cyber cafe, much like I am right now.  My friend Chris was sitting at a computer near me, and this dude comes over and starts talking to him.  Chris was a big time Kerry supporter... he was actually the head of the Green Party here at BW, but for all intents of the election his branch was voting for Kerry.  So this guy starts talking about Bush being president and how so many people are not happy with it, how he wasn't happy with it, and how so many people are trying to get into Canada that the waiting list is forever.  He said he heard about an internet service started by Canadian women who were willing to marry themselves off to Americans (for money obviously) so they can stay in the country for the next four years.  He dubbed them ""American Refugees""  So he and Chris started to search for this website, while continuing to vocalize his desent of the American public voting Bush into office.  Since Canada's waiting list was pretty long, and he was gay so he didn't want to marry, he and Chris decided to think of other countrys they could find refuge in.  They finally settled on India... ""its great, if you don't mind cholera and the caste system.""  They said that the countries should leave signs on their border ""Hi, Welcome to a country that's decent.""  Chris brought up the possibility of a draft to my new gay friend.  That set him off.  ""I'm a mouthy, gay, flatfooted liberal... if they try to draft me they will never hear the end of it.  I will bitch my way out of the army if they don't like my deficiencies""  He says that military guys are hot, but when they start yelling they make his want to piss his pants.  He claims that he will get there and announce ""I am senor pussy puss, if you give me a gun I'll or run home crying""  By that time I am trying so hard not to laugh, and Chris is just rolling on the ground laughing.  This dude just prances away on his telephone like nothing, and I was totally upset, cause I was enjoying his rantings.  It was definitely the highlight of a really rough day... I needed a good laugh.  Anyways... I need to head to the Lindsey Crossman Chapel for a fun performance of some Classical Indian music.  Good times.  Hopefully my gay friend will join us again in the cyber cafe for some more comic relief."

"event","So if my life wasn't confusing enough, I went to go see the Falsetto Trilogy at BW tonight with Crysten.  Man, was it fucked up.  The first act was just rediculous.  It was about a guy who was going back and forth between himself now and as a 14 year old, and he was having flashbacks about how he tried to seduce his teacher, and about his high school sweetheart, and then back to present about his wife, who looked like Maria Ras but acted like Elissa ha ha, but then they'd all be in the same scene together and messing with his head and mine.  At the end of the act the guy comes out of the closet and leaves his wife and kid.  Crysten and I just looked at each other and were like... what the hell just happend.  The second act was this guy, Marvin, trying to get his family together, and he has a lover, and then his ex gets together with Marvin's shrink, and its all weird, but it had a point... getting the family together.... and then out of nowhere the characters dress up like the Village People and sing a song... and that was about the time I gave up... I just didn't get it.  The third act suddenly got really deep when Marvin's lover got AIDS only they don't really say it, its pretty much assumed, and me assuming you people won't ever see it will give away the ending... he dies.  I really have nothing against the plot, or the theme.... I'm all about gay rights, woohoo... lets do a play about it, and it was a good story line, but just totally messed up.  The music was pretty good and the harmonies awesome, and the singers even better... but I just didn't even know what was going on with the plot.  To make things even more messed up... each act had a different cast.  WHY??  This play had never been performed all three acts together.  That's what they tell me at least.  No matter what they think... this does not make it ok to mess Diana up and put a hot white guy as the one character for the second act, and then a sickly looking skinny Asian as the same character in the third.  Not ok.  But I guess it was meant to distract Diana from her own fucked-upness and concentrate on the play's fucked-upness instead.  Diana's biggest fault?? Her talking in third person.  I do that all the time.  I'm a weirdo.  My tiredness just hit me like a ton of bricks... and its only 1.. I don't know what's going on with me here.  Anyways.. today we had piano again, moved on to the second book... sweetness, very excited.  Didn't really get to talk to Joy cause she had a cello lesson right after which sucked, and then my stupid sister.... arg.. I'm angry at her... she is stupid.  I got gas for $1.83 and then it went down to $1.81 which sucked a lot.... I was not happy.  
     So the weather people have been saying its going to snow.  AHHH NO SNOW YET!!  It's so early... it can't snow... its gonna be cold.  I don't want it to be cold.  But who needs weather people when I've got my foolproof way of knowing winter is coming.  :)  First of all I know winter is coming because I have become negatively charged again.  This talent has only come to my attention since I've started driving, but its definitely foolproof.  Every time I get out of the car during winter-time I get shocked.  Now right now it's still not too bad, and not too often, so we've still got a while before full blown winter.  But when it's really winter, every time I get out of my car I get... like a freaking defibrillator shock.  I'm afraid to get out of my car cause I know what's coming.  It's not so bad if its raining or slushy on the ground... I don't know why... not dry enough or something, but if its dry.... I swear its going to put me in the hospital one of these days.  The other foolproof way, and the way that I prefer to show winter's coming:  Orion.  Awesome.... I got out of my car tonight, and I looked up at the stars, out of habit... and there was Orion.  I just don't get what it is about that constellation... that its the only one I can pick out out of a million of them.  I love it though.  I love seeing it.  Its the only good part about winter besides snowball fights :)  If Orion was a guy... I would so date him... ha ha.  Ok that was a weird thing to say... but there's something about that constellation that draws me.  I'll find out someday.  Until then, I'll just sit outside in the bitter cold and stargaze... because I'm crazy and that's what I do.    When I was at camp over the summer.... the last one I went to... I would lay in road and stargaze.  Tamara and I spent the one night in the road trying to figure out the universe.  Something crazy like that... and I don't even think we were drinking that night.  The stars always seemed romantic to me.  Mysterious... I think that's what always drew me... anyways... I think I'm gonna get going to sleep, or maybe watch a movie cause I'm suddenly awake again.  Goodnight!"

"event","Ok, time to update.  It's been a long long time since I wrote in this, and I won't lie.... its because I forgot my password.  Ha ha.  Then I remembered I emailed it to myself a long time ago... last time I forgot it actually, so I went and found it... blah blah.  So here I am in school, chillin, writing in my journal.  I don't really have much to write about.  Nothing really goes on in my life anymore.  I don't have friends, so I don't do anything, so I don't have anything to write about.  Let me see... I did really bad on my music midterm... which sucks, but I can handle it, cause I did good on the first test and on my paper.  In my history class we're learning about trench warfare, and about the Armenian holocaust... which is great, and we're going to learn about the Jews too... and guess which genocide we're not going to learn about?  The Ukrainian one.  Of course.  It's bullshit... why do I have to learn about how every other culture suffered when nobody knows about what my grandparents went through when the fucking Soviets took all their wheat away and starved them.  Then lined up my grandma's family... four of her brothers... and shot them right in front of her.  We learn about how one million Armenians died in their genocide, and a bunch of Africans killed each other in their genocide... but what's seven million Ukrainians killed by Stalin in the Soviet Union.  It's important to know about other cultures, not just the Jews being killed by the Nazis.  If you're going to teach it... teach the whole story.  I'm done ranting.  Anyways, on Saturday CYM had its Halloween party, and it surprisingly turned out really cute, after a few technical glitches at first.  I was the ""DJ"" for the night, so that was fun.  I was dressed up like Madonna.... Material Girl Madonna.... but none of the kids knew who the hell Madonna was anyway, so to them I was just dressed funny.  After the dance we had a bunch of dry ice left, so Yuriy was putting it into pop bottles and filling them with hot water then throwing them out on the field and they would explode.  That was interesting to watch.  Then I went home and watched Pulp Fiction.  If anyone has ever seen that movie, I think I need some explaination.  It was strange.  Then yesterday.. Sunday, we went to my grandma's house and my parents got into a fight over a fight that my dad's having with his uncle... its just really confusing, but I had to listen to their bullshit for an hour... then my dad and I went to Target... then I took my sister to her friend's house to go trick-or-treating, and her friend lives by my cousin's house, so I went over there for a while and just hung out, then I took my sister home and watched Raising Helen... one of those mindless chick flicks, but I think I needed mindless yesterday.  Especially after Pulp Fiction.  Which I get now... thanks to Shane.  Lol, I'm just slow sometimes.  I'm not stupid, just slower than most.  And just sometimes.  And now I'm just being repetative.  Repetition is due to lack of things to say.  My lack of things to say is due to lack of things to do which is due to lack of having friends which is due to my being a loser.  Its all just a vicious circle.  Someday I'll be cool though and I'll have friends, and a boyfriend, and I'll be a famous rock star, and I'll be like... in your face you stupid BW bastards and bitches who were too cool for me when I was there.  That would be after I move to the alternate universe where I can be cool. :)  ....  I suck at life.  Can't I be back in second grade when do-overs were allowed?  Hey... God.... DO-OVER!!! Please?? Yeah, whatever.  It makes me feel so much better though because I have friends like Bails who tell me they miss me for no reason at all.  Or Tamara who'll just IM me or call me with a random inside joke because she knows that I need a pick me up.  So I guess being a loser is ok, because I have a few awesome friends... even if they are miles away and I never get to see them, I still love them and I can't even express how much I miss them.  I don't know what I'm talking about anymore I am a walking oxymoron.  I just always worry about the friends I have... because they are going on to do bigger and better things, and they are going to find better friends,  and they're all going to forget about me, and I'm going to be left alone as usual.  So I just figure... get used to being a lonely loser... because that's the way I'm going to end up.  But I still can't help trying to hold on to my friends as long and hard as I possible can, because I love having them, and I love them.  I hope they know that.  I'm gonna get to my loserish self again, and get to class... and maybe I'll clear my head and write something that actually makes sense later tonight."

"event","So... today I'm bored.  So I thought I would update.  Cause that's always fun.  Even when I don't think I have a lot to say, I always have something to say.  Hopefully the computer won't wimp out on me and delete all my genius writings.  So what did I do this weekend?? Nothing.  Let me see... Friday I was at BW till like... 10 working on one of my group projects and we had lots of fun... we got a lot done... yeah right... in between the pixie stick eating contest when we got bored.  I got second place... 24... it was gross.  I got home and watched Mean Girls... it was stupid, then went to sleep.  Saturday I went to Meg's concert then had to pick up my sister from her band party, so since she could only stay till 12 that ruined my night.... I hate that I always have to pick her up I can't wait till football season's over with.  Yesterday I slept in, didn't go to church, helped my brother make cookies, then my family went out to eat at Outback.  My dad, for some reason was telling me how some lady told him about his past life.  Apparently in a past life, my dad was a white man in China.  He was there to write a book.  That's why he likes rice so much.  I thought it was quite interesting.  My mom gets mad when he talks about that stuff, but I think its amusing so I just go along with it.  Speaking of China, my Chinese/Malasian music teacher is a racist.  She just goes on and on about how white people are uneducated, and white people don't have culture, and their religion isn't openminded, and they only know one language and all this bullshit.  Today really pissed me off... because she said something about how white people don't know anything about Buddhism.  Even though I have learned about Buddhism in all the China centered classes that I have taken, and I know two and a half languages.  Even though I may be Catholic, that doesn't mean I'm closed minded to other religions.  Just because she's Chinese doesn't mean that her culture is any better than anyone elses.  I have a lot of mean things to say about her, but I don't want to, cause I'm better than that, and because I'm too tired.  I have so much to do today.. I have to call Bails, and I have to find a job, and I have to do my service project write up and I have to write out a chart about Islamic empires, and I have to buy Haloween table cloths, and I have to study for 2 midterms.... so much.... and I have to do a take home test for psych.   I don't have time for life.  OH, can't forget about Megan today... got to take her home.  Ok... now that I have all this straight, I think I might head off to class... don't want to be late for that.  I just don't want to walk up three flights of stairs.  Funny... that's the class that I've missed the most just so I wouldn't have to walk up stairs.  I'm such a lazy bum.  That's ok... I'm gonna go now."

"event","Ok.... I'm ready to retry this.  My computer may be slow, but it's dependable.  It's not just going to erase my typing.  And I don't pay 28,000 in tuition to use it either.  Geez.   Anyways... squirrels.    Berea is absolutely overrun by squirrels.  It is absolutely rediculous.  They are crazy suicidal squirrels too... running out in the street all the time.  I'm not one to stop for squirrels either.  It's not like there's a squirrel crossing sign anywhere, so they just need to stay out of traffic.  And another thing.... they will come right up to people.  Like beggars on a street or something... they just come right up and stare, and sometimes follow people around.  Kinda creepy.  The worst is when they sit in trees and yell at people.  Now you may think I'm crazy, but they really do.  They sit on branches and make noises... and I'm always afraid that they are just going to jump out and attack me one of these days.  It's going to happen, let me tell you.  By the way... I saw a black squirrel today.  Who knew that there were black squirrels in the area.  It was nuts.  Ha ha, no pun intended.  Now BW students take full advantage of this infestation of rodents.  .  My teacher was telling us about one of his students doing her senior thesis on the squirrel population of Berea.  Great.  Mommy and Daddy pay 28,000 tuition so that she can go chase squirrels around.  I'm so proud of you honey, you've counted all the squirrels in Berea.  Now you can go out in the real world and do... something with counting.  My parents would flip if I told them that was my senior thesis.  While I'm on the subject of BW tuition.... or somewhat near the subject... let me tell you what my twenty eight grand a year is going towards.  Napkins.  Every napkin in the whole school has the BW logo on it.  Who needs that.  I'm almost sorry to wipe my mouth with a napkin at lunch, because I just see my money going into the garbage...literally.  Makes me sad.  So its really convenient how this is flowing together... cause now I'm going to talk about lunch today.  Anya's friend Mike was on a roll with stories today.  He told us a story about his friend.  So they were at a Chinese restaurant (irrelevant information, but adds to the story) and they were talking about fights they got into in elementary school.  So his friend Ryan says.... I only got into one fight ever.  I was in fourth grade and I bumped into a sixth grader.  He came barreling after me and I ran as fast as I could.  I hid in a corner, but he found me anyway and started punching me...I couldn't move, and the only thing that ran through my head was... ""How could this be happening.""  Who thinks that when they're being beat up. Most people would try getting away, or punching back, or get angry at least... but he thinks.. how could this be happening.  It is dude, get a grip and do something about it.  So funny thing, this guy shows up in the cafeteria.  So he sits down with us, and Mike decides to embarass the kid some more.  He has Ryan tell the story of when he was in second grade.  Now this kid went to a Catholic school.  The Sister told the class to draw God's greatest creation.  Now think back to second grade and think about what you would draw.  Maybe a flower, or the sky, or a rainbow, or your family... maybe if you were materialistic a tv or your house, something to that extent.  Now Ryan picks the Grand Canyon.  It's a pretty sweet creation, I must say... but a little complicated to draw for a second grader.  So he tries to draw it, doesn't succeed.  Somehow, the Grand Canyon turned into a mountain.  Again, still not bad.  Apparently, a mountain wasn't great enough for this kid... cause he decided to make the mountain a volcano.  Not only a volcano, but a volcano that shot out fire balls that was destroying houses and killing people at the base of it.  In a Catholic school, this kid decides that God's greatest creation is a natural disaster that kills people and destroys property.  Ryan still brags that his picture was hung up on the wall.  Some people's kids.  Oh... I forgot to mention... I'm really excited about this.  In my world civ class I got my report back and I got one of three A's in the class.  Really really happy about this.  I knew I liked that class.  Well... I'm out of sweet story and news.... so I think I'm going to go watch some tv and eat applesauce.  Goodnight!"

"event","What do Thomas Jefferson, Pope Leo XIII, Jules Verne, Edgar Allen Poe, and Ben Franklin have in common?  No it's not a joke, sorry... there's no clever punchline.  I'm not good with jokes anyway.  But I did figure out the secret.  In World Civ class the other day, we were talking about Descartes. Very interesting dude he was.  Particularly his theory of deductive reasoning.  He started to accept only priori truths and conclusions that flowed logically from those truths.  A Priori is a truth found in a manner which is independent of experience.  Decartes went as far as saying that we cannot accept anything that comes from sensory perception.  So this computer may not really be there, or the people I'm talking to aren't real, or the next step you take the floor might not be there kind of thing. For example: Something cannot exist or not exist at the same time.  This is true.  It just can't.  A very famous a priori truth stated by Descartes is ""I think, therefore I am.""  This is how he proved that he himself existed.  Nobody else was proven existent, so its possible that we are all figments of Descartes' mind.  I do have a point in all this... besides trying to convince everyone that I'm on ganja.  My professor tells us that Descartes had a major opium habit.  This got me thinking.  The answer to my first question: they were all drug users.  So I looked it up online... here's what I came up with:
*marijuana: Thomas Jefferson,Bob Marley, Jim Morrison, The Beatles,George Washington, Al Gore, Newt Gingrich, Bill Clinton
*cocaine:Thomas Edison, Jules Verne, Pope Leo XIII, Sigmund Freud (who would have guessed)
*mushrooms: Jesus, Lewis Carrol
*heroin/opium: Janis Joplin,Picasso, Edgar Allen Poe, Ben Franklin, Descartes
Which also gets me to crazy people... John Forbes Nash,Jr., Albert Einstein,Vincent Van Gogh... all schitzophrenics.  So for all those people like me who want to be famous some day and don't know where they're headed in life... be crazy... all the geniuses were... and if you're not a genius, just take a hit of that blunt... because it seems that's the way to do it.  I should write a book... how to become famous.  It'll be a best seller, brought to you by crack cocaine.  That's all I have to say for right now... I was just in one of those moods, and a note to my fans out there... don't take me literally... I think I'm crazy."

"event","I wish I could just disappear for a while.  I just need a break from everything.  I think that would help me calm down a bit.  In the past week, I have decided that I just don't like people or organized activity.  Which is actually very anti-Diana.  I am usually a people person.  I love talking with people, and being with them.  Recently people have just started to annoy me.  Maybe its not everyone.  Well.. its NOT everyone.  Just in particular the people that I have been spending the most time with.  It just makes me realize why I haven't been spending time with them in the first place. I know this all sounds like high school drama... I'm just sick of the Ukrainian community.  They are all just backstabbing people.  And I thought that by this age they would grow up. I really miss my friends from high school.  More than they will ever know. Like... so much that I'm about to cry in my school library.  They are real friends.  That's just great.   Anyways... as much as I worry that we won't stick together, I know those are the friendships that will last.  I think the only reason that it wasn't so hard to say goodbye when they left for school, was because I knew that we would stay friends.  Hope that we stay friends.  Most of my Ukrainian friends though, its like... we're friends by default, and I'm absolutely tired of that.  I am not one to pretend to be someone's friend.  I like to express my likes and dislikes to people.  Especially recently, I've become very openly opinionated.  I guess that's cool.  I just don't feel like I have people to talk to anymore... like I don't have friends, and I don't fit in anywhere.  Which brings me to the organization thing... Organized activity sucks.  I used to like things, like choir or dance or drama.... in high school... but not before you had to change everything about yourself to fit into the organization.  I will not sacrifice my individuality (is that a word) for friends.  Fuck friends.  I don't need friends.  Really that much.... Not to mention all this election shit coming up... I just don't even want to vote anymore... because politics is all about who can lie better, who can put more adds on TV and who can talk the most shit about the other person.  That's bullshit.  One of you is going to run our fucking country for the next four years.  Grow up, for goodness sake.  Lets fix this mess of a country that we have instead of bickering about stupid shit.  And can we please look at the stuff that is really important here.  I mean.... gay marriage and abortions are important topics, I totally agree... but compared to the lack of jobs in our country, lack of health care benefits, the war, and terrorism, that's all just trivial.  I'm totally just going off now... I think I better get to class before I make a scene in the library or something.  Its time to find an actual person I can talk to as opposed to a stupid internet journal.  ~Diana"

"event","Ok... so more about this BW thing.  I really don't like the school.  I'm actually pretty freaked out by it.  I think I finally figured out what it is that I don't like about it while I was talking to Alya, and that might help me accept the fact that I have to spend a whole fucking year there.  So my group of friends in high school... actually, everyone I knew in high school... I can honestly say it was a very eccentric, diverse group of people.  Actually... all of Parma was diverse.  I think that was what brought all my friends together... like... we get along because we're so different kind of thing.   It makes things interesting.  I like interesting things.   At BW, its the complete opposite.  The majority of the people... it seems like they've been brainwashed.  They are all the same.  If you even tell them that you don't listen to Jessica Simpson or I don't even know what's popular in music... then you don't belong there.  This kid that sits with us at lunch won't even look at me the same because I said I liked classic rock.  I swear, there was an alien invasion and all these people were brainwashed.  Its crazy.  ... and OH... the stereotypes.  When I get home, I feel like I just came out of the tv or something.  Think of the stereotypical football player and cheerleader from like... 90s sitcoms.  That is Baldwin Wallace.  It's crazy, let me tell you.  I just don't know how to handle it.  I don't want to be a stereotype... I don't want to fit in with them... I just want to be myself... but I don't want to be an outcast I'm not like everyone else.  I can't stand that place. It creeps me out.  Well I'm going to sleep.  Goodnight!"

"event","thought id wait untill i actually had some news before i posted on here again. so here it is 
last weekend i went back to stoke for nicks 21st and it was def worth going. got to see corrina and stephy again and the bands were awesome. unfortunately we missed dan's band, the fuckin awful support band (which is actaully there real name) but heard from others they were brill and wrongly named. we missed them cos we were trying to finish the bottle of vodka that nick brought for us while he was at sound check, as you can imagine we were all fairly drunk by the end of the night.  then another local band played, who i think were cartell but not sure. next was the band we'd been waiting for, plastic toys and they def lived up to expectations by playing an awesome set. the singer was hot and was all glittery ( i like shiny men, teehee)
then nicks band hebephrenic were on and in my opinion played theyre best set yet. they really got the crowd going and all the band had really good stage presence, theyre def gettin better everytime i see em, it was funny watching nick run round in circlesm he nearly tripped himself up with the wires, 
we stayed for the clun night at the mill and it was fuckin awesome. had forgotton just how good it is in there. should be even better the next time we go cos the new room will be open, yay. walking home with nick was the best, he was absolutley trashed (we were all drunk but nick was def the worst). he kept askin us what our fave type of potato was..... not sure exactly why, he was singing nick nack paddy whack at the top of his voice and walkin in to anything solid. was a perfecr end to a great night"

"event","i sooooo late updating this but my laptop's been a bit dodgy. been at home a week and its deadly boring, job hunt as already started so will keep my fingers crossed. 
had a great weekened at download and saw loads of wicked bands, also meet a load of crazy people 
suppose id better go through the week in some kind of order so i dont forget anything. 
we arrived on the wednesday afternoon before the campsite even opened, so managed to get a fairly good camping spot. spent the rest of the afternoon and the following day meeting loads of random people, including another dude who goes to keel uni. found that camping right by the walk way was a great way to meet people. 

the festival started properly midday on the friday. queen adreena were the first band on stage and they rocked. katie-jane was great, manically throwing herself round stage while swigging from a wine bottle - classy bird. next band was lordey although only caught they end of their set. then saw biffy clyro who in my opinion were only mediocore, however megadeth who followed lived up to expectations and delivered a brillaint set. we went off to the snickers stage after that and saw the end of Inme's set, wasnt to bothered though cos have seen them before. next band was my chemical romance who fucking rocked, ive never really been into them but theyre live show was brillaint, the singer is a proper showman, espically when he announced that he wasnt wearing any underwear. the night ended with garbage who played a good set despite having techincal and wardrobe problems (shirley mansons belt kept undoing. so that concluded the first day of music but not the end of the day. the rest of the evening was spent consumming large amounts of vodka (yes i did pass out) and watching jake scare people using a sausage as a fake penis, the reactions of some people were hilarious. 

started the saturday morining off with a blinding hangover, which is never a good way to start the day but the bands on soon changed that. first on were trivum who delived a brill set and really set the mood for the day. next on were the dwarves who lived up to reputation with the guitarist comming on naked wearing a gimp mask. these were then followed by the mad capusle markets who played a surprisingly good set. didnt really wanna see alter bridge next so me and steph went for a wander to get some food. next band on was papa roach who i really wanted to see and luckily they didnt dissapoint. they played a mixed set and ended with my favourite ""last resort"". 'A' were on next so me and corrina went to have a look around the market and buy me a new nose stud cos somehow i had lost the one i was wearing. got back in time to watch one of my fave bands Bowling soup. musuically speaking they werent very good but they got an A+ for crowd entertainment. firstly they made the two halfs of the crowd shout at each other (they were split by a divide) they got one half to shout how are you? and they others to reply fuck you. also one of the crowd had an inflatable sheep, Jarett (lead singer) asked for it so that he could insert a banana skin up its arse. the ""inbetween songs surfing"" tune was really as well. next came HIM one of my fave bands, but unfortunatly they were crap. Ville looked rough with his short hair and gave off the impression that they didnt really wanna be there. they are way better when u see them on their own tour. then there was Anthrax who im not really into but played a good set. the real shocker for me though was velvet revolver, id heard a few of there tracks before hand but didnt really like them, but am now a converted fan due to the amazing set they did, fall to pieces was just brillaint. they really got the crowd going ready for black sabbath who headlined. ozzy was the perfect showman and kept the crowd entertained, all the time wearing a massive grin on his face. that 1hour and 1/2 only felt like 10mins. OZZY OZZY OZYY oi oi oi!!!!

got up early on the sunday morning in time to see the comdeian henry rollings, he was well funny and had everyone laughing for an hour. Society 1 were on next with their singer trying to beat of the record of the longest gig while suspended from meat hooks, it was a bit gruesome for 11am. next it was mudvayne, hadnt really heard any of their stuff but they played well. Papa roach did a brill set next playing a mix between their old and new singles.they ended with one of my fave songs ""last resort"" and the crowd all sang along. killswitch engage and nightwish played next but i didnt really listen to them, just sat on the bank chilling out and resting my feet. next were one of lisa's fave bands Slayer, who played a brill set and looked like they throughly enjoyed it. slipknot followed and played an average set, although joey Jordison's drum solo blew me away. his drum kit was on hydorilcs and he played really well. they did get the crowd going tho, by asking everyone to crouch down (which they did) and then jump up all at the same time. 
the highlight of the weekend was definatly system of a down who played an electricfying set. they opened with BYOB and ened with my fave song 'Sugar'(which has also become the theme tune of the hardcore four. as it was their 10yr anniversary they played a kinda greatest hits set, which meant they played everysong i love. was a great way to end the weekend. 

apart from the bands there were many campsite antics, such as campsite terrets, and a dude tied in a sleepbag called bagman. all in all it was a brillaint weekend and i definatly want to go again.
thats it for now

thought id do yet another update. been in the flat on my own all weekend and its been bliss, glad kay is back now tho. 
had a wicked weekend as normal. stephs sister kate came to the mill with us on sat and it was ace. shes soooo like steph just even louder. we went shopping in the afternoon, i brought a sqeaky rubber duck on a key chain called tulah (or however u spell it)and then the four of us (corrina, me, kate and steph) went for dinner at whether spoons. 
it wasnt a very eventful night out. steph finsihed with doodah and he didnt turn into a weird stalker dude, which was a surprise. nick was sweet and offered to sort him out for steph. i got in trouble for mr nick for smoking, but it wasnt my fault cos kate kept giving them to me :)
last night me and steph decided to go to karakoe at the union. it was a fun night. however we managed to miss the last bus and ended up walking from campus to college court. it wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be, only took us an hour and a half, but that was probably cos the majority of it was downhill. ended staying up talking to steph till 5.30 this morning, so needless to say havent really achieved much today. although did watch drop deap fred with corrina and steph, was well funny. now i know what nick is going on about when he sings the dog poo song. 
anways im knackered so gonna go to bed now, wow its actually still dark, this last week i been going to bed in daylight 
night night

"event","ok, so i been a bit of a lazy arse recently and not bothered to update this, as corrina has been moaning :) thought i better had 

oh god this is gonna be epic. right well suppose i should start with the week of hell that was exams. i had all three in one week and thought my head was gonna explode. got a funny feeling that im gonna be back up here in the summer doing resits. went to see nicks band hebephrenic again that week, now seen them 4 times and they keep gettin better and better, love the new song they did, who'd of thought nick could actually sing insted of screaming. 

survived the week of exams and followeed it up by getting extrememly drunk at the mill. been there so  much now that all the weeks have kinda merged into one. this was either the week the steph pulled doodah, the week that james went home with his ex (the least said about that night the better), or the week that i got hit on by a random dude in a really bad hat. either way all them have been good nites. i love the sugarmill, its go so that we know more people there than we do at the union. we also have an extra edition to the hardcore four and that is nick. hes been out with us lot nearly every week since easter, which is cool cos hes soo much fun. esp when we all randomly beat him up. :)

what else have i been up to? hmm, got a third piercing done in my ears the other day and i love it, got a purple stone in it which is cool. next piericngs i wanna get done are my top right ear and my lip (but dunno if i actually will get it done cos im a big baby)

me and corrina went to wasted on thurs, just the two of us went not the whole hardcore four. i thought it was gonna be a crap night cos corrina's dude jamie was there. but all was good cos i got a poodle shaped balloon :) great for whacking people on the head with. also saw Daz out for the first time in ages. i mean i saw him on the bus the other day, but its not the same. i really thought i was over it, but id forgotton just how cute he is, even if he was wearing shorts and a tootoo. (it was carnival night) i def wanna go to wasted again, it was like outlaw at the union but 10 times better, shame its only on once a month 

ooooooh found out my download ticket has arrived. cant wait to go, its only just 2 weeks away now. 

 stephs sister kate is comming to the mill with us tonight so it should be a good night, as normal. just hope that doodah doesnt stalk steph too much 
anyways gotta go and retrieve my washing from the laundrette. 
bye bye *waves*"

im not very good at updating this at the mo, keep forgetting about it. so what have i been up to..think think think....
last friday and saturday went to the mill (yes i know i basically live there) the fri nite was actually good cos we took the piss out of the indie kids and the fact that they dance like theyve just been eletricuted, corrina does a really good impression..hehehee
been putting off doing my revison for the rest of the week,although have made a very nice revison timetable that took a few hours. 
oooh found out from nick that my mate gaz is aztually called daz, turns out id been a muppett i got his name wrong, yet im sure he introduced himself as gaz....ahwell. went to flares on monday and saw him before hand in aruba, he was in a grumpy mood cos he was at work so wasnt his usual happy self. 
nick came out to the union with us on wed nite, was well good cos he sooooo drunk, alos hes had is scrotum pieced and kept complaining about it, got no sympathy for him cos its his own fault.
went to the mill again on sat, was a really good nite, met nial (dc101 off SRS) and hes really sweet, his mate dan is kewl aswell. had to walk home in a thunderstorm, which was fun cos we all drunk :)i didnt even notice that daz(gaz) hadnt been out either, im so proud of myself.ooh kate was out as well, was good to see her. 
anyways id better be going now, cos got lecture then off to the SRS all dayer at the rigger. should be a fun day

time for another much needed update, hopefully will start updating it more regularly now im back at uni. i havent done a great deal since i updated last. went out in wrexham with kirsty over the hols and it was quite a good night. also went shopping with mum and got loadsa new clothes, which was groovy.
in the process of dying my hair at the momment. its black on top and blonde underneath, although it needs re-bleaching cos my roots are blonde and the ends are ginger. cant decide whether to dye it flame red or to leave it blonde. hmmm shall have to think about this. 
went to the SRS (stokerockscene) meet up on sat night at the mill. it was a really good night, met a few people off the site but was quite drunk so cant remember exactly who, was having a problem reading stickers.nick and dave were out and were really funny. accidentally hit nick in then face again and made his teeth bleed, oops. hes definatelty gonna think im the violent one now. shame really cos it was fun when he thought it was steph.
better get back to work now

sunday was a nice relaxing day - spent most of it in my pj's watching tv with corrina. did get some of my essay done tho, clever me. we watched slackers which is really funny, execpt the guy in it reminded us of scary eyebrow jon, freaky. only got dressed to go to the karoke in the evening, yes i know its lazt.karoke was good, some guy tried to sing bohemian rhapsody (cant spell it) and it was hilarious. 

yesturday i didnt leave my room till the night. spent the whole of the day doing my essay, which drove me crazy. got 1500 words of it done though which im pleased about. went to see hebephrenic in the rigger again that night. they were good, getting better each time i hear them. we got there a bit later than intended so any saw two bands, but it was good to get out.

got the last brownie meeting tonight so hope it all goes well. definatley not planning on going to KRAP social this week cos have too much work to do. 

anyways better get back to it

had a wicked night at the mill. was extremely drunk from vodka, apple sours and reef, nice combination. only my head is complaining a bit now. oh my god im so pleased for steph, she pulled dreads-in-your-pocket, think his name might actually be jon but not totally sure :)either way hes a nice guy, corrina pulled jamie to. so that just left me and lisa to dance the night away, unfortunately there was no lesbian conga this week, will have to wait to after easter now. although i did get swiftys nummber and a kiss, go me. i didnt even have to ask for it, we were chatting and i mentioned i was going home for easter, so he said id better get have his number then, cant complain about that

did bekkis hair purple before we went out. its the same purple as mine is only brighter cos her hair bleached better than mine, goddamn her. its still not as cool as mine though, ha ha. i have the coolest hair ever and also the most modest. 

thats about it really. really need to get cracking on my 4000 word essay cos not even reached half way....opps

ah well

havent updated for a bit. so i thought id do it now. finally got my essay handed in on thursday so its one down and one to go.
saw hide and seek on wed. is such a good film. kept me in suspense for ages then the twist confussed me. has put me off playing kids games for a bit. had a huge panic cos the bank wouldnt give me anymoney, thought there was something wrong with my card but in fact there was no money left in my account. crisis has been averted though cos mummy saved the day. i now have enough money to last to the hols, but seriously need to get a job.
 
went to outlaw on wed night. got pissed even though i wasnt intending to, not sure what went wrong there. was a good night but shame there werent more of us out, we were actually able to get a taxi instead of a mini bus. had a good time but nothing eventfull happened, execpt i finally spoke to evil jon9 again, he spent 10mins waveing at me, what could i do, he was embarrasing me. 

was suppose to go out for st patricks day last night but didnt feel very well. kinda felt like my head wasnt attatched to the rest of my body. so me and steph watched the first series of coupling instead. id forgotton just how funny and cute jeff is. 

actualy made it to lab class on time today, shock shock horror horror, was there before both bekki & kim. dunno what was wrong with me. got my accomodation forms back, gonna be living in lindsay K block which should be fun. no more 29 bus everyday, wahoo. head still doesnt feel great today so will prob get an early night as busy day tomorrow. plan of action is  get some of essay done, go in to hanley with corrina, watch the rugby at uni with kay, meet bekki in castle, bleach & dye her hair, meet lisa and go to the sugarmill. should be a good time had by all

nearly finished my essay- only got 500 words to go now yetand still actually havent used a text book for it yet...opps go me. 

made cakes at brownies last night, twas much fun. got chocolate every where but it was well worth it. they did their sponsored silence as well which was bliss. 20mins of pure heaven. but then when it finished they went crazy. slight communication problem in that both me and jenny took mini eggs. which was no problemo cos spent the rest of the evening munching them.

went to kaos in k2 as well last night. was a good night, just a shame there werent more people there. i got really hyper from 5 cans of red bull, which was prob really scary for everyone else, esp as i couldnt sit still. there was finger painting going on but none of us could be bothered to do it. dave and nik were a constant form of entertainment all evening. thought nik was gonn cry when corrina pinched him, i couldnt stop laughing. now he thinks we're all violent, not just steph. tried to give nik a cake that i made in brownies and the bastard thougt it was poisoned. 

anyways better get on with my essay if i wanna go out tonight else corrina will kill me :)"

up stupidly early for some reason to today so thought id get my essay done, then swiftly changed my mind again. i think im doing well with it mangaed to write 800 words without opening a text book, just gonna have referencing it an the end. joy of all joys 

went out to the mill again on sat night. im so much of a regular the bar stuff know what i want to drink before i even order, its scary. was a really good night, execpt for the drama with becky and her mates, still cant beleive that they left her there. the bands were quite good. Hebephrenic are a bit heavy for me but its fun watching dave and nik, theyre absolutely mental on stage. was a bit dissapointed with Lesbian bed death, such a cool name and yet such a crap band. totally missed cartel cos we just didnt get there in time, ah well. 
brought another skirt on sat as well, i know shock shock horror horror. its a knee lenght denim one and then i got steph & corrina to customise it for me. it looks wicked now and not like a new look skirt at all which is great. 

me and steph had pizza hut last nite and it was sooooo nice. feeling fatter today though. then we watched finding nemo, i love that film its so cute. 
oh oh i think my MP3 player has finally come today, bout time an all, i been waiting over 3 weeks for it. now im gonna be able to have music on the bus again, yay

right suppose id better carry on with my boring essay. theres no rest for the wicked."

im in the libary of death, will i ever return, who knows...... doo doo do(suppose to be evil suspenseful tune there)

what have i been up 2? hmm let me think. well went to harry and kumar get the munchies on wed, it was sooooo good. i just love stoner humour. made me really crave a mcdonalds tho, but then when i had one it made me poorly. damn you mcdonalds. was suppose to go out on that night but am skint as normal, plus saving my money so i can have a good night at the  mill on sat. 

redid my hair purple last night, so now its no longer weird shades of ginger and pink. but somehow managed to get dye everywhere, even on the soles of my feet, dont ask. been in uni all day today and now feeling like im going crazy
oh stole the NIN album of corrina the other day and now i cant get closer outta my head. its such a good song and reminds me of being at the mill (no steph it doesnt remind me of swifty, honest)

stephs juts sent for how gay are you and i got 46% which means im a balanced hetrosexual....go me, however first time i did (with exactly the same answers and same percentage) it said i was a lesbian. hmmmm

went to the KRAP jelly and ice cream social last night, was well good fun. although i did have so much jelly and ice cream that i felt ill. loadsa people were there so was a good night. dave was so proud of himself cos he had made some of the jelly. i swear him and nik are just like a male version of me and steph, they fight, bicker and just generally act childish all the time, which is funny. somehow didnt get to bed till like 3am, not quite sure how that happened tho. am very tired now however.
general consensus is that me and steph know some crazy crazy men, but at least we're never bored. shame corrina or lisa didnt come out though, cos then that would have made the hardcore four complete.
got loadsa work to do on my lab book, have nearly finsihed one lab but still got 2 do. really cant be arsed as theyre just pass or fail and dont actuall count for anything
might be going to see harold and kumar get the munchies later with steph, so should be good. but thats if i get enough work done. 
better get back to it then

missed my only lecture today cos i overslept, well what do they expect putting them at 9 in the morning. so been trying to make up for that by doing my lab book, only somehow am missing all the sheets for the 1st experiment, results for the 2nd and dont have a clue about the third, so things are looking good. 

went round to steph's last night and she cooked pasta carbonra (cant spell) for me and phil, it was well nice. was a tiny bit hyper off apple juice so the evening was quite crazy, espically when phils feet mananged to sound like mice shagging. not quite sure what went on there, but was very funny. the others watched a film but i dissapeared to attempt to do work, execpt walked in on vix giving dammy singing lessons so joined in. 

suppose to be going to KRAP social tonight with steph and corrina, theyre giving away free jelly and ice cream so i have to go. got brownies first tho so going to be a stressful evening. 

thats it for now

as normal im writting here when i really should get some work done. i cant help it, live journal is just to addictive. 
went to karaoke with steph, corrina & mark last night. was good cos also met up with becky and kate. im offically a heroine now cos saved kate from a very awkward situation. go me. steph sung again, this time she did like a prayer by madonna and it was brillaint as normal. i wish i could sing, but alas i can never fit the words to the right tune, being tone death and all. 
nothing else exiciting happened. execpt i got up at 8.30 today to do work - prob feeling guilty about the little i did last night.
anyways thats all for now

saw corrina's live journal thingy and i thought id get me one of those cos it looks fun. 
besides im using avoidance techniques so i dont have to start an essay quite yet.

went to the sugarmill last night and had an awesome time. feeling slightly worse for wear this morning (actually afternoon) when i got up. it was great cos james was out and he was absolutely rat arsed, for some unknown reason he kept trying to steal my thumb, yes you did hear that right, he had a slight obession with my thumb. then he had some kind of a sign language arguement with steph, only we didnt know what the hell he was going on about. also found out that rolled up posters can be used as offensive weapons. 
swifty was out as well(my god he looked so fine in that velvet top), it was so bizzare having him and james in the same place at the same time, although i did get a free drink from both of them.

quite pleased with myself today cos have achieved quite a bit, finished my lecture logs, nearly finished my essay plan for tomorrow, done an incy bit of reading and watched the joys that is the O.C. seth cohen is absolutly stunning, well worth watching it for.

what else have i got to say, suppose to be going to the karaoke later tonight with steph, so had better get a tad more work done and get some grub. 

bye for now

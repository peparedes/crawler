"event","Well it's 2 days from Christmas and I just am not very excited. Normally I would've been preparing for the holiday 3 weeks ago, of course I have all of my shopping done and all my presents wrapped but it just isn't the same. I am actually more excited about Chris getting his presents than me getting presents, come to think of it I don't know if I actually want anything, I have all that I need. I have no explanation for the way I feel, maybe it's the fact that because I'm getting older all the traditions are changing, maybe it's because global warming has caused it to be a 60 degree Christmas. I wish I knew what is causing me to be in such a depressed mood that way I could change it. But I have realized something helpful, I need to become a better person, a better daughter, a better girlfrien. After being the cause of so many arguments between myself and my boyfriend and myself and my mom I have discovered that things need to change, before I lose everything I love. Take Chris for example I do so many things that make him angry, not purpsely I just can't help it. Honestly, I know he doesn't like my jealousy, he doesn't like my attitude towards my brother or family (which I try to behave but I guess I can't get anything right anymore) I hate dissapointing him and my mom, but I feel like that's all I do. I feel like shit and not even Christmas can change that. I wish there was something I could do to make me a better person and to be able to let myself be loved and not argue with it. I just have a bad feeling in he pit of my stomach that I am going to fuck everything up and I am careful not to do something wrong but the more careful I am the wrose I fuck up I feel as though I can't do anything right, so I guess this is my New Years resolution to become better and to not fuck anything else up. I hate arguing, even though my mom claims I live for it, I just want everyone to want to be around me not do it because they have to."

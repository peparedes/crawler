Concrit on the character of Rhinox may be left here in comments.  (Although do keep in mind that this version has been through the ""Reality Warped"" stage of <lj comm=tfblogs> and is being given a second chance following his role in <i>Beast Machines.</i>  He may be a little darker and a little more devious than strictly canon <i>Beast Wars</i> Rhinox at times.  The whole point of giving him a second chance at life is to work those issues out.)"

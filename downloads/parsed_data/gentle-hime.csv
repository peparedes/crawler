"event","I apologize for um, not being around for the past two weeks, but I've been very busy with family stuff and a few other recent things...um, an American magazine read the interview Shikamaru-kun and I did and wanted to take some pictures and get my thoughts on being a female guitar player.  I'm a little worried about the pictures, but hopefully they won't turn out too badly.

Overall I've been pretty happy, and I hope everyone else has been too.

Oh!  This weekend the Cooking Club and the Movie Club are having a combined fundraiser event at the Nindaime Dorms.  We will be showing the first two <i>Bourne</i> movies on one floor, the <i>American Pie</i> movies on another floor, the first two <i>Pirates of the Carribean</i> movies on another floor, and the first four <i>Harry Potter</i> movies on another floor.  For a modest donation of two dollars people can enjoy as many movies as they like, sleep over, and partake in food and games with prizes.  I hope to see people there!  <s>It's going to be a long weekend...</s>"

"event","Things seem to be going well lately, I mean father is happy with the aptitude I've developed thanks to Itachi-san and he feels the muay thai I have been taking is proving good for me as well.   I've been doing well with my Cooking classes, and preparing for the Interview that Shikamaru-kun and I will be giving to some American music magazine.  Maybe if that interview goes well Naruto-kun could interview <i>Assassin Dolls</i> on his radio show...<s>I'd be so nervous.</s>

The movie trip with Naruto-kun was really fun, and I missed spending time with him.  It's good practice for if I ever get a date.  I am hanging out with Lee-kun again soon, and I know that will be fun too.

I've been working more on my dancing and my guitar playing, they help to keep me sane between my father's continuous calls and the intensity of my classes.  Thanks to the car father is generously letting me use, I've been able to take lessons outside of campus which as been good.  I believe I can salsa and tango like a pro now, according to my instructor.

<font size=""1""><s>Now, if only I could stop wondering why I can't get dates...</s></font>

<i>Give me a shot to remember,
And you can take all the pain away from me.
A kiss and I will surrender,
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead.
A light to burn all the empires,
so bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
in love with all of these vampires,
so you can leave like the sane abandoned me</i>"

Naruto-kun, I'm really looking forward to going to the movies with you, and I'm sure whatever you pick will be awesome.  

Shikamaru-kun, um, are you still interested in doing that interview?  I've got the number for the magazine reporter, so just let me know.

It would be nice if he ran things based on merit as opposed to by birth, although I have grown accustomed to the idea of possibly running the company.  Still, I have a long way to go and I know it.

"event","Before I really get into talking about myself, I must apologize to you, Lee-san.  It seems a picture of us out together getting into my car after leaving that...establishment...made it into the <i>Konoha Times</i>.  I truly hope that this doesn't impact your social life.

Things have been so hectic over the past week or so since I last updated, and I've discovered that I react to and combat stress in rather interesting ways.  First off, I seem to have lost my need to sleep for a full eight hours, and find myself functioning off half that amount.  I also notice that I sometimes get so caught up in what I'm working on that remember to eat becomes an issue.  Not good...

Being in my room is somewhat odd without a roommate.  Certainly, I have more room to spread out, but there are no distractions here except my bass and guitar.  I have been playing them more often since the concert, especially with that interview coming up, but otherwise most of my time is either spent driving to pick up needed paperwork or cooking supplies, or at the gym pushing myself to get better.  I might have lost weight, but I'm not certain.  That might be what the pleasant trainer said after whistling at me, although it was preceded by a compliment towards my derriere.

Anyway, I need to get going.  I've been craving Portuguese Monkey Bread, and the only store that carries the needed ingredients closes in an hour!

Otherwise, things are good on the family front, my father is pleased enough with how things seem to be progressing that he's decided to let me come and go as I please for a little while.

"event","I feel incredibly pleased that it seems the recent media storm has finally started to yield positive results.  I got a call from an American music magazine who apparently saw footage of an <i>Assassin Dolls</i> show on some website and wants to interview Shikamaru-kun and I about the band, and come to our impending show.  He mentioned that he had all sorts of insightful questions, and hopefully they will actually focus on the music and not anything silly.

I've been up most of the night working on finishing up the songs we'll be playing, which is funny because Shikamaru-kun fell asleep a little while ago.  Thankfully, I can pluck out notes on my guitar without disturbing him since he seems to be able to sleep through anything.  I am hoping that tomorrow I'll have a chance to get in some training before helping to show Lee-kun around.  i feel I haven't been devoting enough time to that.

Spoke with father again today, and while he has never been a fan of my decision to be in <i>Assassin Dolls</i> he is at least respecting that I have been working hard to make certain I meet his goals.  I must remember to thank Itachi-kun since I passed fathers' latest quiz with flying colors.  Now if I can jsut avoid the date father is attempting to arrange for me life will be good.

This conversation was even laced with subtle threats as to what awaits me if I prove myself incompetent.  It was definitely not a conversation I wanted to have the night before a big cooking test...

I realized something the other day though, I miss Naruto-kun being around because he always helped me to understand when I was placing unreachable goals upon myself.  Shikamaru-kun is good at helping me with that as well, but he has had quite a lot going on lately and I really hate to be a bother.

Perhaps I have nothing to worry about, and things will turn out for the best.  It helps, in a way, to know what the consequences will be if I do not meet the goals my father set before me.  At least I know that he still considers me worthwhile enough to consider  me in his future plans.

I think I need to do something to get my mind off of all the stresses that I have.  I mean, between my classes, training, calls from my father, and everything else I think some 'me' time is in order.  Who knows though?  Maybe I'll discover I work best under pressure."

I can cook up something nice and even make popcorn and stuff.  I just really would like to not be so bored, and lately it feels like all I've done is worked on homework, classwork, and training.

Oh Itachi-kun, happy birthday.  Um, I truly hope you have a good weekend and enjoy the day, and um, thank you again for having the faith to tutor me.  I made you something, a little gift as well as a small cake, and I will bring them to our next tutoring session.

I informed my father that Itachi-kun has volunteered to tutor me in the ways of economics and business, and while I know that I will be tested on my developing financial acumen he was very pleased that someone of such stature as Itachi-kun is assisting me.

I have been finding myself easily falling asleep, but once asleep dreaming of things that are both thrilling and frightening in their intensity.  All I know is that it is a place I do not recognize, and there is a man there with me speaking in calm, pleasant tones.  What he says I have yet to decipher, but he fills me with peace and eases my fears.  We dance, and he makes me feel beautiful, and then...well other things occur until I wake up feeling empty and more alone than ever.

I wish I knew who the person in my dreams was...since he made me feel as if there is still a chance that there is someone out there for me.  It's difficult sometimes, growing up as isolated as I have.  I didn't realize how naive I was until I met Kankurou-kun, and I am still so incredibly embarrassed that I actually believed that <i>thing</i> in his journal...the fact that I had to look it up is more horrifying than I would ever admit to.

I allowed certain events to affect me in a negative manner, and I began to act like someone who I am obviously not.  I've been short-tempered, snappish, even foul-mouthed...and while at the time it may have felt right looking back I had no right to vent my frustration and annoyance in such a manner.

This might come as a shock to some of you but I was talking to my father, an actual honest and good conversation about how recent events have affected me, and he pointed out that I've changed recently.  I really don't know exactly what started it, but I don't like who I've become.  My father pointed out that I lost my focus, and allowed Fate to get the better of me.  He said my increased training has been good for me, and said that if I continue to act as a spiteful child I will lose everything I worked so hard to obtain.

Anyway, I will do my best to recapture who I was before everything seemed to go wrong, and I can only hope that in time, after I prove myself worthwhile again, people will forgive me my trespasses.    

<lj-cut text=""A question for any Business or Economics Majors, except Neji-kun"">
Um, I am in need of assistance.  My father wants me to somehow incorporate a Business degree into my current plan for the future, and has agreed to allow me to minor in it while keeping my major in Culinary Arts.  The only thing is I will be needing a tutor because my grasp on the basics of business are limited solely to investing.  Would anyone be able to assist me?

I apologize Neji-niisan, but father specifically said I was not to bother you on this matter.

He actually told me that I need to be careful because somebody might <i>steal</i> my underthings from my laundry simply because people now want to know <i>things</i> about me.  Anyway, I'd like to clear up some of the things going around...

<lj-cut text=""The Facts"">
First off, I am a virgin.  My father wouldn't let me date so I've never even gotten more than a kiss on the cheek.  I'm allowed to date now, but I doubt anyone would want to considering.

Second, I only drink and family parties and when eating a nice dinner.  I've never done anything remotely reckless until that last Family party.  So no, I'm not heading to rehab, although my father wants me to attend some AA meetings to halt the potential problem in it's tracks.

Third, I'm no party girl.  I don't go clubbing or to fancy movie premieres, and while I'm sure I could get some awesome seats at concerts I've never had anyone to go with so I simply don't.  I don't have the time to go to any clubs or major events - between working part-time, band practice, classes, homework, family stuff, my training, the Cooking Club, and trying to keep up my GPA it leaves little time to screw around.

I've always prided myself on not being like most of those other heiresses, wanting to follow the path set by Ivanka Trump rather than by one of those Hilton twits...but one stupid decision and some hazy fun ruined all that.  I'm done apologizing for my mistake, and I feel terrible for the fact that other people got involved in this crap.

In an effort to keep the lines of communications open while I work to repair my friendships and credibility, I am willing to answer anything about myself.  I will not hold back, and I promise full disclosure.  I am fully prepared to lie in the bed I made for myself, so have at."

My little sister has apparently been subjected to questions regarding my breast size.  There are bets among some of her classmates, she says.  I deserve whatever I get after dishonoring my family so, and I am certain father has a few ideas in mind.

I am so incredibly sorry to everyone for my behavior, it is obvious that I should not only never drink again, but also become a hermit.  Ino-chan I apologize doubly to you since I know there have been a lot of calls coming in.  Father has arranged for me to stay at a nearby Hotel until this dies down...I truly have become the disgraced heiress the newspapers are labeling me as, and I cannot even begin to fathom what I shall have to do in order to redeem myself to everyone.

<lj-cut text=""Private, Hyuuga only"">
According to father everything would have been fine if I had only kept my mouth shut and accepted his offer to find me a date.  He told me that he feels I was obviously corrupted by Shikamaru-kun, and that I would do well to simply accept that only he knows what is best for me.

He complimented me, sort of, by mentioning that almost every available bachelor he knows asked for my phone number.  I believe that is the reason behind the sudden influx of financial term-based pick up lines that I have been getting.  Some of them are truly ridiculous, like ""wanna let me rebalance your portfolio?"" or ""you should see my growth fund.""  

I really don't know what to do, I know I need to lay low and simply let this all blow over, but I hate not being able to live my life as I would like.  I never wanted this, any of it.  Being the heir to the Hyuuga fortune is far more trouble than it's worth.  Do I even still have friends or supporters left?

Why didn't anyone tell me I'm such an obnoxiously bratty drunk?  Naruto-san will probably never speak to me again...
</lj-cut>

Oh, I changed my cell phone number.  I've sent text messages to everyone with the new number if you need me."

Oh Ino-san, my father sent an invitation along for you and a guest, if you'd like to come.  It's a semi-formal dinner party, and um, you could meet my family.  I will let you know that the Hyuuga are incredibly formal though...suits and ties for the men and um, cocktail dresses for the women.  I wonder if anyone else will be going, as father's zaibatsu has a lot of investors...

Otherwise, Sai-kun made a comment the other day that has me re-evaluating myself.

It's funny, usually I sleep horribly, but the past few nights I've slept really well.  Perhaps my exhaustion from Zaraki-sensei's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerdrit"">lerdrit muay thai</a> lessons are really helping both my mind and body...

Otherwise, I wish I had someone to spar with.  Um, Uchiha-san, I will be at the gym most of the evening tomorrow if you would still like to spar.  I have a training session, but my stamina has improved and I would really like to test myself against a worthy opponent, um, but only if you are still interested.  I would also like to find someone to um, go to the movies or something with.  If anyone is interested I'll certainly treat.  Now though, I've going to put on my iPod and go for a job around campus.  Father mentioned that I'm starting to look a little top-heavy, and as such I will do what I can to get into better shape.

Oh, by the way Sai-kun, Ino-san...I'll be sleeping in the room tonight.

<b>[Hyuuga-locked]</b>
Father decided to drop a bombshell on me, and it was not only untimely but also unexpected.  In light of everything else that has happened this week I should have expected it, but that is only because my Fate seemed destined to be horrible.

He has decided that regardless of my thoughts, my hopes, my dreams, and most of all my objections - that I need to become more business-savvy.  He feels that my chosen major, though <i>technically</i> business-related in the nature of how I wish to apply it, does not fit in with his master plan so that means changing my major to something business or investment related.  

He wants me to either give up on my dreams of being heiress and forfeit the position to my imouto by choosing to be married freeing me to pursue my own dreams without the entanglements of being a Hyuuga if my Father-approved husband decides that is appropriate, or be disowned, or learn how to run the zaibatsu to that I can assume my destiny and take over for him when he retires.

I don't want to be a businesswoman, not for my father.  I want to open a restaurant, or a bakery.  Raise a family and live for myself and that family...I don't want <i>his</i> life.  Nii-san does, but father would never let that come to be.  It's ridiculous.

I now believe I understand the meaning of the phrase <i>'up shit's creek without a paddle.</i>

The only real saving grace is that he told me I have until the end of the term to choose, and until then he will leave me to my own devices and allow me to be my own person.  I feel a severe desire to do something incredible un-Hinata-like, and yet I wouldn't know where to start.  Perhaps I shall go dancing at a club, or on a shopping spree, maybe I can get a date and actually <i>make-out</i> and experience my first kiss and grope.  I suppose it's just a matter of finding a willing accomplice...

"event","I suppose I can thank Sai-kun for letting everyone in on my dirty little secret, although please don't believe the revelations are worth their salt.  I will admit, I <i>did</i> love Naruto-kun, and had for most of my life.  There, I've said it.  Now, can we all let it go?  I have.

Something happened this weekend, something good.  A rebirth of sorts, and in a strange way I again only have Sai-kun to thank for it.  Shikamaru-kun also deserves my sincerest gratitude as well, but he already knows that.  You see, I went to that party and discovered that I'm apparently not as invisible as I once believed I was.  Just because one guy never noticed that I've grown up doesn't mean that other guys haven't noticed that.  

It was really sweet, to have somebody ask me to dance even if it was simply out of an obligation born of sympathy or pity.  While I really hope that people realize I recognize pity when I see and experience it, I was far too amazed and gratified to take offense to Sai-kun's rather selfless gesture.  Even now, knowing that he so casually aired my personal business for all to see, I'm fine.  Sai-kun freed me from that burden and now I can honestly say that while yes, I once felt that Naruto-kun was my everything I have realized that I would rather have a truly happy best friend than alienate him over my own...<i>misguided</i> feelings.

I just need to find someone who likes me, and would like to get to know me...I just wish I knew of some guy around this campus who actually found short brunettes to be interesting.  Um, if anyone does, please let me know."

Thank you for the dance, Sai-kun, I hope to do that again sometime.  Also, thank you for being so careful when that person accidentally um, pushed you into me.

Naruto-kun, have you been finding the bento I've been leaving outside your door?  I started leaving one for your roommate as well.

I seem to have collected  few nicknames, and it's kind of interesting to see what people think of me.

My father is having a party next Saturday, and I need a date.  Contrary to popular belief Naruto-kun is not my boyfriend, so um, I shall have to find someone else who wouldn't mind an evening of formal Hyuuga fun.  If anyone is interested please let me know...I will make it up to you somehow.

Now, off I go to class with Chef Morimoto.  I'm so in awe of him, I can't believe I won the right to be his assistant all trimester.

Oh, for dinner I was going to make chicken croquettes with jasmine rice, green beans almondine, and a pan gravy so if anyone would like some I would enjoy the company and um, any critique of my cooking.  Please let me know."

Um, I suppose a few trips are in order, I just wish I had some assistance.

I think I covered all the standards including the deviled eggs Naruto-kun wanted, as well as some healthier fare as well.  I ended up making a red bean chili nachos, spinach and feta rolls, some pork and chicken dumplings, buffalo fingers, a few different fresh fruit and vegetable plates, and a variety of little desserts..I really hope the food goes over well.  There's other stuff too, I really wasn't sure what people would like...

Father called earlier and reminded me of a few things.  He feels that if I do not take certain steps to adjust my lack of needed familial traits, I will soon be learning what life outside the family compound walls may be like permanently.  In a rare show of good faith, he allowed nii-san to make a suggestion, although I am unsure of how well it would go over.  Um, to that end, Uchiha-san, I was wondering if you might like to engage in some competitive sparring sometime soon...please?

Otherwise, tonight will be a new night for me...I plan on doing something to help myself truly become happy.

I have been steeling my nerves all day so that I can get myself in the frame of mind to finally confess my true feelings to Naruto-kun.

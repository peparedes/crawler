"event","Yesterday was my birthday. I actualy started my job on my birthday. It was okay though. I only worked for three hours and couldn't wait to get home to my baby. He'll be a year old next month on the 30th. I can't wait. I'm hoping I can round up some people, but I doubt any of them will come. I think it'll probably be just me, Josh, and the grandparents. Which sucks because I wanted to make this an ultra super event. I'm talking huge dinner (I'm thinking catering), some fun games for my baby, and some fun stuff for the adults to. I hope everyone can make it, because it'll mean a lot to me. So, please people, come over and help me celebrate my son's birthday."

My dear friend Mary hasen't been answering her phone, so I don't have a babysitter. Josh and I have never really done anything together ever, so scratch that idea. Actually, now that I think about it, I really hate my birthday. Or any other holiday for that matter. So, have a drink and party for me kids. Looks like I'm sitting this one out."

"event","I really hate Flint, MI. This is the worst place I have ever been. Finnaly got the car done, so I'm visiting home for a while. Manistique might be boring, but I like it a lot better than this hell hole. My brother and sisters woud like to come live with me. Which might be fun if I could find them good schools to go to. I have to find an elementry school and a high school. Unfourtently, I hate the idea of raising my son down here, let alone my sibbilings. They're mouthy and always look for ways to get into trouble and niave. But they're good kids. Our mom just has so many medical problems it's hard for her to take care of them all. 
On a sadder note, I'm selling my ball pythons. I've already sold my leopard geckos. My favorites actualy. I hate getting rid of pets. It's so sad. Eventualy when my lazy husband gets around to it, we're hoping to open our own pet store with rare snakes and aggresive fish. The balls were not going to be part of it. Just my beloved pets."

Not only that, but Grandpa Pettey, (which would be Josh's grandpa) had open heart surgery today. Four of his arteries were clogged. It's not that I don't like Josh's grandpa, it's just that I've been at the damn hospital way to much. I feel like I should be doing something fun. Get out and be by myself for a while. It might sound selfish, but I don't think you really understand until you have a ten month old babe running around wanting to play with everyone and everything.

He started bitching about my rat. About how bad it looks and how old he is. I was like, you have four dogs who make this house smell like shit, and one of them has an eye that could explode out of his head any day, the oldest one's claws are digging into it's paws, and the other two haven't been given baths in over a year. He got all pissey and said if I wanted to irritate him today, keep talking about his dogs. I was like fuck you. He doesn't intimidate me at all. What is he going to do? Nothing. After all that drama was over with, (he still isn't speaking to me) I called up a freind and got out of the house for a while. I think I had to or I was going to freak out. I guess I'm really sick of all of this.... If anyone knows about some places for rent, let me know. We really need to get out of here."

Nothing to big, but something that won't be afraid of a mouse or a rat. I'll have to go through the books and check to see if there is anything that catches my eye. Possibley a lucistic texas rat snake. Petco has one in thats mean as hell, but eats really well. He might bite a lot, but he is really pretty. Plus, he's not a bit dangerous. He won't get big enough to eat my kids or anything. 
So far, everything has been shit. I'm pissed off at so many people, it's unreal.

When other people have them, I like them, but if Ihave to live with them, it's a whole other story. It wouldn't be bad with just one, but no, there's four of the stupid things. Maybe if there weren't so many of them I think it wuld be okay. Anyway, Josh and I are disscussing opening our own pet store consisting of nothing but fish and reptiles (and feeders).

My youngest sister Samantha is only eight years old. When I was home I practicly raised those kids when Mom was working. She worked the graveyard shift six days a week. When she was home, she was sleeping. I had such a strong bond with those kids and not being there when they need me is heartbreaking. Both of my older sisters were and still is are cunts, so them being involved in our lives were out of the question. I just need to be up there for like a week. At least thats better than nothing. It'll be hard though. Josh not being able to see Salem for that long will drive him crazy. We've already discussed it and he has a week vacation saved up, so he could go with me. But, he hates the U.P. so much, he refuses. So, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Fuck. I have no idea what to do."

I remember one of the group home leaders drove him out and stayed with us until it got dark. In June it isn't warm enough to swim, but he dove in anyway. He is so accident prone, I hope he didn't kill himself. He could of put himself in another coma. Josh doesn't like him because he has U.P. humor. I think he's funny.

We have two ball pyhtons, a blood python, and a few leapord gecko's left. Still, I always bruise myself on the tanks, so everything is getting moved around. Josh is getting a fish tank pretty soon. I didn't care for the idea at first, but it's okay now. I sat down with him and he let me help pick out which fish we should get. It's not as easy as you would think. All the fish I liked would get eaten by the fish he likes. So, we settled on clown knifes and other preditory fish. Oh, we got two eggs from our leapord gecko's. Its's so exciting. I can't wait until they hatch.
Anyway, I plan on taking another trip home soon. It really is such a beautiful place. The night sky is uasuly so clear, you can see so many constalations. My favorite time to look at the stars is uasuly right around when the hunter's moon is out. It's always so bright. The moon litterly lights up the whole sky. I don't want to sound sobby, but I miss home. The lakes, the river, the woods. I even miss some of the people. Everything there has been preserved. Family values are taken very serously. They trust each other, no one has to lock their car or front doors. I would love to take some of my freinds up there with me. If any of you have a thing for nature, let me know.

Don't get me wrong I love josh, but he needs to take some lessons from Jimmy. He is such a good guy. Jimmy your girlfreind better consider herself lucky because any girl would be lucky to have you.
  By the way, thanks for doing my journal for me sweetie. Looks a lot better."

"event","It seems latley that everybody is either hurting or pissed off. Of course being a sweet person (I am, wether you beleive it or not) matters of love, being in love, or were once in love bother me the most. What I have found out is that no matter what anyone tells you, it's always going to hurt bad when someone you once cared about walks all over you and then blames you for the entire thing. Maybe its just me but I'd move on. You'd have to. Wether moving on takes you to a new town or even across the country. If thats what has to be done, then do it. If you're ready to come back, then everyone you've known here will be waiting for you and love you just as much as when you left. 
    On an other note, Josh came upstairs last night to ask me if we had any pictures of me on the computer, I said I didn't think so. Then, about maybe five minutes later I hear him laughing. About an hour or so later i asked what was so funny and he said that since we didn't have any pictures of me, he sent his freind a picture of Jenna something. I didn't make the connection at first but instead of a picture of me, he sent a picture of a porn star. Has to be a guy thing. (no offense to zack). Also, we have been trying to work things out, but... I don't know. We'll have to see."

"event","I don't really give a fuck any more whether you care about me or not. Yes, you got one snake that's expensive, I was over that in a few days, but you're going to get more. And you were just thinking of yourself because you didn't even get Salem a Christmas present this year. Everything I said is true, you can't deny that. You did ask me to cook when I got home and it's your fault you didn't eat because there were things to make. You just didn't do it. So, I'm pretty fucking sick and tired of going around in circles over this. Get what you want, do what you want because I'm done."

Josh hasn't exactly been helping alot either. As soon as I got home he wanted me to make him something to eat. I just got back from a five hour drive and he wants me to cook!!! I don't know, I'm just mad right now. Some of the things he does annoys me so bad. Like not being happy to see me when I leave for a while, not thinking of any one but himself when he buys expensive animals. Ugh, I'm so sick of this. The only reason he wants me around is because he can't cook or wash dishes, I swear. I don't know."

So, it was just him and I for about fourty-five minutes. The night still turned out okay and Karl said the squid wasn't bad just chewy. Hey, its squid, its not sopossed to be tender. Then after he left Mary showed up. She is such a sweet person. I love having her over. Salem realy likes her and so do all of our dogs. Oh, by the way, I didn't know until lastnight but I'm allergic to squid!! Mary thought it was so funny. I was so pissed."

Josh told me I should get it and when I answered it, it was my best friend in the whole entire world. I remember asking him where has he been and alot of other stupid questions. He told me he had to go and he'll call me back. All of this would be fine except my best friend died two years, seven moths, and three days ago. I've been sad all day because of this stupid dream. I really wish he was here now. I need to go see him at the cemetary."

"event","I think Josh's sleeping disorder finally rubbed off on me. Its a little backwards now. He sleeps and I don't. Its not Salem's fault at all. He goes to bed and sleeps through the night. Its me that has the problem. I don't know... like i don't sleep more than two or three hours, but in the morning I'm fine. Not even a little bitchy. I don't know... I've possibly developed insomnia. It also could be what I'm using to help me lose extra baby pounds. Josh doesn't like it because its a form of speed. I told him its this or I go bulimic. I've never ever weighed this much in my entire life. When I met Josh I wore a size five! Now I'm not even going to tell you what I wear now. I don't know, I know some people have worse weight problems, but I'm very self conscious about myself. Oh, by the way, Marshall, get a hold of me!!!! We need to have a talk."

You can't even really put your hand in the cage to give it water. If josh doesn't take care of it, it'll just have to die, because there is no way in hell i'm doing it. I can't imagine going to the E.R. for a sanke bite and getting stiches. I've had enough of needles and stiches."

Hes a good Dad to Salem. Also, we've decided to only have one more baby ( i hope its a girl). Not soon, but in a couple more years. Then after the second one is born, I'm having my tubes tied. I've started this new diet. Its actually working though. I'm extremely happy about it. Josh doesn't like it because it involves this grueling work out and I'm sore all the time. No pain no gain. My car is being a pain in the ass. I have to get this special tool to get the lock nut off. So its taking so much longer than it should. By the way, Salem is getting so big! He weighs twenty two pounds!!! I hate it. So, you guys need to come over and see him. You won't believe it."

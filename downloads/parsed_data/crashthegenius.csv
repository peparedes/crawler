"event","Okay, seeing how I've been ignoring my little corner of the web for a substantial amount of time, how about an update?  Yeah, I thought you would like that.

Okay, school is ending and graduation is rolling around, I hope at least.  I got a call from the assistant director of liberal arts just yesterday.  Here she is telling me that I needed an upper level philosophy class to complete my degree.  I was ticked.  No one, not even the stupid CAPP Report said I needed anything like that.  So, now I have to drag my tail over to SUNY Albany, and get an official transcript, to see if they can replace that philosophy course.  If push comes to shove, I can walk with my class, minus one lousy class.  This school continually finds ways to screw me over.

Well, it's that time of year again.  I'm not referring to graduation, the coming of summer, or even final exams.  Once a semester, my buddies and I get together and deliver a massive amount of carnations to the girls that live in the dorms here on campus.  That may sound ridiculous and you are probably wondering why we do it.  Well, the first time, it was really to see if we could pull it off or not.  It took almost two weeks of planning and my close associate Justin and I needed to screen the people that we wanted to come along to help us with this endeavour.  Well, the first two went off without a hitch and all the girls really liked it.  We were supposed to have another delivery, but my brother Seth decided he would come and get blitzed while he was there, by way of a bottle of Jim Beam and Pepsi.  Well, Seth does not hold his liquor well, and before you know it, he was hammered.  Some people get mellow and funny when they are drunk, not Seth.  Seth is an asshole, making lude innuendo remarks about everything, and embarrassing me in front of my friends.  AAHH...then, he figures he will leave, but I was not having it.  I followed him out to his car and got his keys from him after a long confrontation.  There was some yelling, all on his behalf I might add and some RA freaked out and called security on us.  The officer I already knew.  He and I watch the Rangers during the evenings at school during the winter.  He asked if there were any arguements, of course our disagreement had been nullified by that point and I was not going to turn in my own brother on account of an arguement.  He would not give me his keys, he said all he was going to do was sit in his car and listen to music.  I however, did not believe it, so I stood in the back of his car and would not let him leave.  Everyone that was with me that night gathered around.  I am truly blessed to have such awesome friends that were willing to support me and talk to Seth about how much of an ass he was being.  We never pulled the flower delivery off.  We decided to wait a couple of days to let things chill out on campus.  The best bet for us it hang out off campus and then come to make the delivery.  Hopefully we will pull it off.

I worked all day Wednesday and had Rodney over for dinner.  It was good to see him and I will be heartbroken when he goes out to California later this summer."

"event","The pain in my back finally bothered me to the point that I visited my physician on Tuesday.  She said that I should see a physical therapist and that I had swelling in the lower part of my back.  Though I feel I am too young to be having these kinds of issues with my body, I took my doctor's advice and went to a physical therapist.  He gave me different stretching exercises and wants to monitor my progress.  He showed me a model of the spinal column.  I have pulled ligaments and muscles between the two lowest vertebrae and my pelvis.  It's not as bad as it sounds.  The PT put it into perpective, saying that it's similar to spraining an ankle.  It will just take time to get the flexibility back and the pain to go away.  However, I am a really active guy.  I hate being told I have to sit still or that I'm not able to engage in sports.  So, I have to be patient.  In addition, while I am out of work, I don't get paid...bummer.

On a brighter note, Kim and Sam came to visit me the other day.  They are two of the sweetest girls I know and are always willing to do whatever it takes to make someone happy.  Besides a trip to the Daily Bread, they also ate with us.  My mom said they're both ""Ms. Personality"".  I agree.  They are both incredible people.

On Tuesday, Rodney, Myself, and Nick went up to the Tux Connection and put the deposits on our regalia for the wedding in August.  We ended up spending the day together and just flat out goofing off.  We had not been able to hang out just as the three of us for a long time and it was good to reconnect.  Sam, Mike, and Meg met up with all of us later on taht day too.  We had quite the crew traising through the mall...lol.  Rodney continued to share his wealth of wisdom regarding relationships, as he told me that I am going to become emotionally stunted if I don't date women.  Also, I will never be able to form intimate relationships with any of the opposite sex if I do not. He firmly believes that dating will help me find out more about myself.  Ever since I have been separated from my last girlfriend, I have discovered more about myself than I ever did when I was with her.  I've discovered that I am patient, I have overcome a fear of stage fright, I am much more open with people, I can entertain (sort of), I can make people laugh (sometimes), and I have become more confident in everything from social situations, to standing up for what I believe in.

I'm not saying that I have an intense hatred towards women or that I am a confirmed bachelor.  There is a time and a place for everything.  The more time that I am single, I am growing to trust God more.  He knows and is planning my future and that is what I am confident in.  Believe me, I am like any other guy, I have a crush, here and there."

"event","Mike, your party was awesome last night as usual.  From pool; to throwing back a few; having Erin jump on my back; to Sami in a rather inhebriated state yelling out unspeakable things; to cheering on UCONN to their victory over Duke in the NCAA semi finals; to Twister; playing cards; yeah, there was a lot of other crazy stuff in there that I didn't mention or forgot.  Yeah, it was a ton of fun.  Sleeping on the other hand was not so good.  I had to hit the can about 5 times in the middle of the night...so no, as far as sleep goes, I did not have much continuity.

Practice was a lot of fun today.  Besides going through the music, we had a hysterical stunt with duct tape and silly string.  Royce had a great idea, we need to have a video camera with us next time.  Picture this, Royce, Rodney, and Sue, tried to tape Seth and I together.  That didn't work.  Then, I tried to hold Rodney while the three taped him.  That didn't work, and Royce, Sue, and Seth turned on me and started taping Rodney and I together.  Yeah guys, I know, it looked GEY!  Then Seth pushed us on the ground and it looked like Rodney and I were spooning.  We finally got out of the yards of duct tape that strapped us together, then we got Royce.  We bound his legs and feet together, then pulled his hood over his head and taped that shut as well.  Royce was beginning to look like a mummy at this point.  We finally quit and and he peeled it all off.  However, his feet were still bound tight.  He ended up hopping around and finally fishing out a pocket knife from his pocket and cutting his feet free, slicing his shoelaces in the process...lol.  FUN TIMES.  Well, after the taping fiasco, we had a bunch of wads of duct tape that we started chucking at one another.  In particular, there was a huge wad, about the size of a basketball, and one especially tightly wound wad, about the size of a baseball.  Wads of duct tape hurt, when hurled at your buddies.  LOL"

"event","Easter break is here, and you know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to pack my bags and head for the beach, you heard me, the beach.  I'm going to hang out at Flaggler Beach in Florida, on the East Coast or maybe I'll go to Cocoa Beach on the Gulf Coast, YEAH.  Sun in my face, sand under my feet, and hot women all around me.  YES, THE BEACH.

Okay, this is my reality check.  No, I am not coming within 150 miles of a beach.  I'll be working all week.  But I need the money, desperately.  If I do want a new car by this coming December, I need to get some serious cash saved.  And, let's face it, I get a week off from school.  I get to relax, play some video games, hang out with friends, and celebrate the Ressurection of Jesus Christ.  Yes, this week will be fun, regardless of the work.  Unfortunately, there will be no hockey this week.  They ripped up the ice today and the management is unsure if they will bring it back.  Financial oversights are the main factor, which comes back to poor management.  I don't know all the details, but about a year or so ago, they completely cleaned house as far as the staff is concerned, and hired new personnel.  Still, the BIG Arena is still in the red.  I hope they are able to square away their debt soon.  That rink has a lot of sentimental value to me.  I not only learned to play hockey there, but I met some awesome people too.  The BIG was the first place I got to play for Siena College as I suited up and played for the Saints, and I didn't do too bad either.  That meant a lot to me, I had so many friends there that night, it was amazing, they all cheered for me as my skates hit the ice.  Then getting on the bus after the game and having all the player congragulate me for playing well.  If nothing else, I think the rest of the guys respected me because I hung tough for the entire season.  If you can go to practice everyday, give 110%, work hard to get better, and be a team player, your teammates will respect you.  I believe that by the end of the season, my teammates respected me.  I really miss playing this year.  In addition, I remember all the late night playing open hockey and hanging out in the tavern upstairs with Chris, Mike, and the rest of the open hockey regulars.  I bought my first new pair of skates from the in house skate shop, a pair of Bauer Vapors.  Recenlty, I have switched to a Swedish brand of skate called Graf.  Still, I hope they bring back the ice, especially since the Albany River Rats, Guilderland High, Bethlehem High, and Guilderland and Bethlehem youth leagues play there.

And it is April Fool's Day.  I am a little paranoid as to what kind of pranks my friends still might try to pull on me.  Actually, I think I should be wary of my friends for the next few weeks, simply because they might try to pull a joke later this month; on the belief that I have dropped my guard.  It's not going to happen.  And, even if I do have to swallow my pride and bear the brunt of a really good practical joke, I warn you, revenge is sweet.  Also, I am exceedingly good at devising, planning, and executing the ultimate practical joke."

"event","Well, this weekend was interesting to say the least.  So, strap yourselves in, make sure your tray tables are in upright and locked positions, and strap on your hockey helmets.

Well, on Friday work got out early, so I went over to Siena to begin filming the movie.  The first few scenes went well and then we all went over to Chuck E Cheeses for some dinner and video games.  I got hooked on ski ball, basketball, and this fishing video game...it was incredible.  I hammered about half a pizza.  I was starving, between work, filming, and video games, I was a hungry boy.  Well, we camped out at Siena afterwards...watched a little bit of the NCAA Tournament, and ate Starburst.  Afterwards, I went home.  It was an early night for me, but I was really tired.

Saturday, I was in the freezer for the entire day.  I can pretty much figure that I will be in that locker for almost every Saturday for a while.  We just can't get good help to stay.  I guess it takes a different kind of man to work in a -10 environment.  Well, besides the cold, we went back to filming at college.  However, the camera was less than agreeable and it ended up taping over some scenes.  We ended up doing away with the movie idea.  It sucks too, I really wanted it to work out.  But all's well that end's well.  We ate dinner and then went back to the school.  Now, Late Night Sarazen was putting on a comedy show.  This comedian Rick Bronson asked us all to sit in front.  I knew right away that we were going to get railed.  However, two comedians have noticed my size...I must be doing something right.  Still, Sam got to go up on stage, where yet again, the comedian picked on her soully on the basis of her ""assets"".  The guy was kind of a jerk, however, he was funny.  He was Jewish and one of the funniest things said that night came in a dialogue with Jacob and the Rick Bronson.  Bronson kept asking, ""What should I talk about?  How about you Doogie Howser?""  Jacob replied calm and collectedly, ""You're Jewish, you ought to be able to do something with that.""  Everyone went nuts...it was hysterical.  Well, the evening ended.  But not before I was humiliated on stage.  Get this, the comdedian was a bisexual too."

Spring break was entwined with work, hockey, and New York City.  That's right folks, I actually got out of upstate and went to visit the city that never sleeps.  Man, talk about freaks.  From the old homeless dude hawking a independent newspaper with a racial edge, to the vendor selling discount comedy club tickets...it was a hilarious day.  I think we walked well over 200 blocks, with about 15 miles of walking thrown in.  Okay, back to the freaks"

I can't believe how fast this semester is flying by.  Siena is in the midst of their spring break.  I guess spring break for any college or university almost marks the halfway point in the semester.  Pretty soon, I will be in my mid twenties and look back on my life and ask, ""Where did my college years go?""  Well, another page in my life begins to turn.  Though certain aspects of my life will change in the coming months, they will be for the better.  I know God is with me every step of the way.

Last night, we had our weekly hockey game over at the BIG Arena.  It was fun, I got to play forward.  I got my name on the score sheet twice, I had a goal and an assist.  Things started to get a little physical as the game went on.  But hey, it's hockey, and that kind of aggression is part of the game and roughhousing is going to happen, regardless if it is a non-checking game or not.  I love hockey.  I would rather play hockey than make out with a girl, hands down."

"event","Shoot, I'm really getting lazy about giving this thing updates.  Okay, here is my week...brace yourself.

Well, turns out I did not just have a head cold, but a sinus infection.  Yeah, it was really bad.  I could barely hold my head up at certain points.  Talk about being down and out.  I missed three days of work and I really hate it when I have to skip out on work, it means more for everyone else, and I lose money.  Finally, I went to the doctor on Wednesday.  She prescribed some heavy doses of anitbiotics.  I'm on the mend and I didn't go to the game tonight, my body is still recuperating.

Well, I went to class Thursday, I really didn't start feeling relief until that afternoon/evening.  Then we all went to the basketball game that night.  Siena won against Loyola, although they were about 12 points behind in the first half at one point.  Justin, Mike, Rob, and myself...here's to guys night out.

Friday was a blur.  I took the day off work again, I wasn't in any way prepared or physically able to work 8 hours.  So I went up to Siena and hung out with everyone.  I shopped for Rob's birthday practice with Sam.  It was fun, we always joke around about how easy it is to push her around.  Then, she tries to hit me.  I can always count on her to try to hit me at least three times every five minutes.  No, Sam that is not an exaggeration either...lol.  Rob's party was hysterical.  Yeah...horror films that were made over 20 years ago are really lame.  We made fun of the whole thing while it was playing.  Then, Kim had left some cake in the hall and on our way out, Mike and I decided we would bring it back up.  We knocked on the door and Sam called me a homo.  I went in and asked, ""Did you just call me a homo?""  She confirmed my suspicion.  Mike and Rob picked her up and we brought her out in to the hall.  Tiffany took the cake from me and smashed it in her face.  Then, smeared everyone else.  I knew I should have done it myself!!!  Anyway, we had an all out cake fight.  Mike Petersen and I mopped ourselves off and headed downstairs, suddenly, we heard Sam coming behind us.  We flew downstairs, into the parking lot and we hopped in Mike's car.  Sam stands there with cake waiting for us to come out.  It was so fun, we taunted her by locking and unlocking the car doors.  Finally, she turns her back and I sprint to get out...I was too slow though and didn't get my door open in time.  Mike's car was parked in front of a snowbank.  I pulled a matrix maneuver and walked sideways on the snowbank with one hand on Mike's car.  I ran away.  However, Mike's car bore the brunt of Sami's cake attack.

Saturday was pretty normal.  Work went well, and I hung out with Sam and Kim at Java's.  Siena won their final game of the season.  It's on to the Supereast tournament this weekend.  Man, I really do miss playing.

Sunday was started out like any other day.  We all went to church, and afterward, I was invited by some friends to have lunch at their house.  It was a hysterical time.  Seeing how myself, Jen, Lucas (both of whom are in their mid twenties), Bethany, Wendy (I won't mention her age, she'll kill me) all act like we are 10.  We shot rubber bands at one another, played an awesome game called ""In Your Face"" and just hung out for an eternity...no one wanted to go home.  Yup, that was my weekend."

This past weekend was hysterical.  On Friday night, I went to see Third To None play at Union College in the Reamer Campus Center.  They had a fairly decent show, they had to play for about two hours...that's a lot of material.  I bought one of their newly designed t-shirts.  Then, Jeff Kren, the lead singer, laying on a table.  Anyway, his friend comes over and starts to harrass him, and eventually yanks him off the table.  Jeff landed hard on his back, but was up and laughing it off.

On Saturday, work was pretty routine.  I worked all day in the freezer.  I got cut at work too...it sucks.  Any deeper and I would have needed stitches to close the wound.  Then, on a much brighter note, Rob, Mike, and I went to see ""Miracle"" with Kurt Russell.  That man singlehandedly carried the movie from start to finish.  It was amazing.  I really wish I could have been there to see it, to see a bunch of kids assembled from the best college hockey programs in the country.  These kids dethroned the Russians that were the most dominant team among the international scene for the last 20 years.  THe best part is, our amateurs beat their professionals.  PURE GLORY.  After the movie, we stole Sam's purse and threatened to throw it behind the ticket counter...lol  She was ticked.  We love teasing her, she's such a good sport.

Sunday was a blur.  Church was awesome, the luncheon afterwards was hysterical.  Some of the kids I go to church with wanted to play ping pong.  However, they were still clearing up from dinner.  So, we went down to the sanctuary and started throwing them at each other.  Myself, Andrew, and his friend Gabe.  It was ridiculous.  These kids are in 8th grade and we were acting like a bunch of 4th graders.  I have officially corrupted the youth of America.  Hockey was ridiculous, the team we played had a full bench, we had two subs.  WE got killed 16 to 8.  Oh well, we can always look forward to next game.  Having Rob and Tiffany and Seth and HEather there made it fun though.

Then it was on to Friendly's.  Well, I was hungry and everyone else got ice cream.  Sam is so funny, I've never seen anyone so little eat so much.  And she's really thin too, I mean fit.  I smeared caramel on her face.  Then she thought it would be funny to smear vanilla lip gloss on me.  GROSS!  But we got some revenge on her last night by dumping her with some snow...lol  To top the weekend off, I came down with a terrible head cold.  WOOHOO what a way to cap off the weekend."

"event","This is a continuance of my last journal entry...about time, right?  Anyway, like I was saying, planning for the future is very wise.  However, one must not be so quick to completely grow up and his or her child like nature.  If we lose this kind of amiability, we become stunted, both mentally and emotionally.  We don't learn as well, we become narrow minded and tend to be quick tempered.  Once people become like this, it is very difficult to talk to them and have them understand different concepts or ideas.  Don't lose your childhood, hold on to it for as long as possible.  Let the years pass naturally, don't force them, reality has a nasty way of forcing us to grow up on our own, so don't push it.

To combat this type of arrogance and dangerously prideful behavior, I think anyone suffering from the symptoms of growing up too fast needs to heed the following regimend.

1)  Go to your local grocery store.  Buy some sugary kids' cereals, like Count Chocula, Waffle Crisp, Captain Crunch, anything that will wake you up and rot your teeth.  Make a huge bowl, eat it.

2)  While eating the cereal, put on your favorite song.  Any music will suffice, but a sure bet to raise your spirits is punk/punk rock music, hands down.  For all the metal and Phish heads reading this, put on what ever music you like.

3  If you have a computer play some games on it.  If you have a PS2 or an equivalent video game system, use it.  Try to remember what it was like when you were a kid and all you wanted to do when you got home from school was play video games, blast your music, and eat.

Follow this, it just might work."

I don't know if I'm known for dispensing advice, but here is my analysis, diagnosis, and treatment for a lot of people that act uptight older than they really are.  That would be about 3/4 of the people I attend school with.  It seems that everyone is grabbing for their piece of the world, be it in terms of money, successful careers, distinguished positions, among others.  It seems that everyone wants to move on with their lives, go to graduate school as soon as possible, and finally, climb that coporate or political ladder.  At times these kids act like snobs and are absolutely mean to other people or students, given their priveleged backgrounds or by how smart they think they are.  These kids that are in college with me, they are growing up way too fast.  They are forgetting how cool it is to be a kid.

Well, in the words of Jason Mraz, ""I've got the remedy"".  Remember when you were a kid, you couldn't wait to get home and play with your friends, have a snack, play video games, talk on the phone, or just hang out and watch TV?  The simplest activities were so cool, because we didn't care about the future.  Now, let me explicate the fact that I do believe people should plan for the future and that college is very important.  One should do his or her best"

On Thursday, I was playing basketball.  When my buddies had left, Brian Albanese and I still hacked around and worked out some plays.  I managed to roll my ankle going for a three pointer...grrr.  I felt the bones grind against one another as I fell to the ground.  Luckily, it's not serious and I should be up and ready by Monday.

On Friday, I was unable to work.  My ankle was really weak and sore.  So, I got to train all day.  Training is cool, you don't have to fling boxes, but the day goes by so slowly.  I hung out with Rob, Rodney, Royce, Sue, Mike, and Meg all night.  We hit up the rock n' bowl at Ravena Lanes that night.  My ankle was being stubborn and not letting me bowl well.  Man, it was a blast.

On Saturday, we had one of our most inspiring shows at Northern Lights.  We played a new song written by Royce.  It got the crowd's attention right away.  I think we actually surprised ourselves by how well we played it.  And, I think it really hit home with the entire band that we we're really capable of playing well, and getting a crowd really into our music.  It was a blast.  Poor Royce, he broke two strings on two different guitars.  Luckily, we had about five with us.  Despite the rampant technical difficulties, we did really well.  We also were able to schmooze with the other bands.  One of the members of C. Jane Run is going to write an article about us in the Gazette.  ROCK ON"

It does seem odd how fast the last five years have gone by, and there is no way I could ever put it all into one journal entry.  Hopefully the collection of memories that I have begun here will transcend in to something more complex and entertaining.  Memoirs...of a sort.  I take classes on Tuesday and Thursday  starting with Spanish at 8:30 and Philosophy at 11:30.  Granted, I am only taking two classes, but this is the first time that I can safely say that I will enjoy the professors that I will be learning under.  So far, I think the education that I have received in going to college has been a success.  I am coming out of a four year institution feeling much more ignorant and unintelligent than when I went in.  A professor last year, Dr. Kenney told me that if you feel this way when you are about to graduate, your education has been a success.  You realize how capable you are, yet there is a wealth of knowledge that supercedes the grasp of human understanding.  So college has been a success...but I still feel dumb.

Okay...that was a brief synopsis of the beginning of my last semester.  On with the fun stuff.  We played basketball today down in the MAC.  It was a blast.  Rob and Dave really take pick up games seriously.  It was funny to watch their reactions when they didn't complete a play exactly how they wanted.  Oh well, it's all in good fun.  I rolled my ankle playing, now it's swelling...bummer.  I have to spend all day on my feet too.  Oh well, such is life.

Tomorrow it looks like we are all going to see The Velma's at FYE in Colonie Center.  They are having a bit of a CD release show, it should be a lot of fun.  Rodney, Seth, and I got to meet them at Siena last semester.  They are really down to earth and are great performers.

On Sunday, my routine was pretty much normal.  I got up and went to church, as always.  Bethany was back from her mission trip in Chile and it was great to hear her give a report on all the awesome work they accomplished while they were there.  It's amazing, she brought back pictures and these people practically had nothing but they were willing to share whatever they had.  I admire Bethany and Erika greatly for going down there.  That's some real bravery.

Then, right after the service, some of my friends from church arranged a skating party.  It worked out perfectly, the ice at a local town park was in pretty good condition and we all had fun messing around with hockey and what not.  It was a ton of fun.

Well, Monday as always begins the work week for me.  It was a bear though, Gourlay and Hannaford had to send a bunch of guys down to frozen.  We lost hours in dairy and grocery.  So, the majority of the work was left to me, Brian Bellerose, and a few others.  Usually we are used to having the workload really light, but today it was not.  Anyway, after work, Sam, Rob, Tiffany, and I got together and hit up the Siena basketball game.  It was fun, I can't remember the last time the Saints won 3 straight in the middle of the season.  Then we had KFC at Rob and Tiffany's apartment.  We watched a bunch of reality TV shows and hit up the newly wed game.  For Sam and I not being a couple, we did relatively well against Rob and Tiffany.  We were even beating them at one point.  Life is so interesting sometimes...lol"

"event","Okay everyone, time for some updates and otherwise catching up.  It's been quite a week, so strap in and brace yourselves.

Let's start from Monday.  It was a pretty routine day at work, we got out a little early.  I stayed at home and tried to get some things ordered in my room.  Along with the cleaning of my room, I had time to sit down and write some checks to pay for my school bills.  

Well, Tuesday I had a doctor's appointment.  Just a routine echocardiogram that I receive every six months.  After my appointment, I decided not to play hockey.  I was tired and I knew that I would only be garbage if I played.  I just hung out at home and played LOTR for PS2 all day.  Sometimes sitting on your ass can be fun.   I met Sam over at Professor Java's for a little bit of a late night latte.  I attacked her with some whip cream...lol.  She returned the favor and smashed me with some right in my nose.  We exchanged some more blasts before we finally settled down.  Man, talk about acting goofy, but I love it.  Sam has this awesome way of making people feel really relaxed.  She's so cool, you can talk to her about almost anything.  Ummm...whip cream.

On Wednesday, Nate and I went to work.  After our shift, we went to help some friends of our move.  On the way over, I had a bit of a scuffle at the Stewart's on Route 4 in East Greenbush.  This guy in a green GMC truck was parked almost in the entrance of the store.  Now, I'm going to pause to add a little anecdote.  My friends, (namely Sam) call me an ass from time to time.  I won't deny that I don't deserve to be called ""ass"", sometimes I can be a real pain.  Now, in the parking lot of the store, I noticed that the man was parked and waiting.  He was a considerable distance from the pumps, so I maneuvered my car in and got out to fill my tank.  As I was about to put the nozzle in, the man yelled from his truck, ""Nice job"".  Due to his distance across the lot, and the traffic going by, I did not pick up on his sarcasm right away.  I replied, ""Thanks"".  I thought he was complimenting me on my parking job.  It was a tight fit, afterall.  Then, he yells at me, ""You're an asshole, I have been waiting for a pump for five minutes.""  Now, this man was parked a considerable distance away from any of the pumps.  He could have been waiting for someone in the store for all I know.  I shook my head, and started pumping.  In less than twenty seconds, this man was able to pull up and fill his tank.  See, he had acted like a jackass and made a big deal over nothing.  He pulled up to the pump right across from me.  I wanted to ask, ""How's the humble pie?"", but I refrained.  

Moving my brother's friends was not hard.  However, my mom did volunteer me and she said they had only a few articles of furniture to move.  We had a lot more than that.  We had desks, tables, chairs, clothes, books, all sorts of stuff.  However, while we were moving the books, the girls father, a retired economics professor who used to teach at the University of Beijing said, ""Please be careful with my books, they are my treaures.""  Though this statement may seem insignificant, it carries a great meaning.  Literature is treasure.  It carries keys to enlightentment, it entertains, moves, and enriches all of us.  The father spoke perfect English, but the daughter did not.  Sometimes she spoke in English, sometimes the first part of a sentence was English, sometimes the second part was in English.  And sometimes, she threw in words in Chinese throughout her statements.  Luckily, Nate and I were able to get beyond the language barrier and work things out.

Okay, let's get to Thursday.  I got to play my favorite alter ego all day, the hockey bum.  We had a pretty up tempo game, which is really good for me because I have to get back in shape.  My legs were like jello for the first few weeks.  Afterward, we spent the afternoon eating pizza, and playing ESPN Hockey and NHL Hits on a 6 foot screen.  Then, it was off to my good friend Charles' house with my wingman, Mike.  We were all set, we had a great dinner out, and we were planning to watch the Devils'/Rangers, but the jerks running MSG Cable decided not to air this pivotal match up.  We were pissed.  We ended up watching the third installment of American Pie.  

Friday was a blur.  We worked like dogs.  I was in the frozen locker and out in grocery.  We celebrated my grandmother's birthday.  She turned 84.  We celebrated with a yellow cake (made from scratch by my mom) and my brothers and I gave her a bird feeder.  I was dog tired on Friday, but that didn't stop me from hanging out with Sue and Royce.  We went to Friendly's for ice cream.

Well, here we are on Saturday.  I got frostbite on my crotch today.  I was in frozen, yet again today.  Somebody booked off, so the majority of that person's hours were given to me.  Well, I got frostbite because there was a huge gash in the crotch of my insulated pants.  There was a cold feeling at first, then a numb one, then it turned into a stinging sensation, then I didn't feel a darn thing.  After I got out for the day, I noticed my legs stinging a great deal.  It actually burned pretty bad as the skin started thawing out.  I survived...maybe I should check in to getting some hazard pay...lol.  THen, we had a practice session.  Things went pretty well.  We were able to hammer out a new song for our show at Northern Lights next week.  And, we all hung out afterwards.  Dude, you should pick up a copy of the metroland this week, we are in it.  Can you believe it, we are actually being advertised.  Life is looking up."

"event","Well, work was relatively uneventful, despite that I had to go down to frozen on a Monday of all days.  Our company only owed 6 hours.  That is roughly a day's worth of work and the guy booked off.  So myself, and a co worker split the hours among us.  Deans Robinson, a Hannaford associate was there today too.  Classic rock gets played in the freezer, and when U2's ""Streets With No Name"" came on, he was making up lyrics.  Did I mention Deans is from Jamaica?  It was hilarious to hear him sing with his accent!

Today I was  also able to hit the weight room.  Lifting heavy weight is incredibly liberating, and I go home feeling really satisfied.  I would love to get to the point where I could compete in a World's Strongest Man competition.  That would be crazy!  The Mighty Bull takes on the world.  The question is, ""Is the world ready for the Mighty Bull?"".  

By the way, chicks dig me...

Now that I have your attention again, I must clarify that I am not God's gift to women and if you need further explanation, chicks don't dig me.  However, I have tried my luck with the ladies, sadly the last few of my ventures have ended in frustration.  In regards to this statement, Rodney my friend and guitarist in our band said, ""You would know about his luck with women if you had listened to our music.""  You have not heard about Gone Ashley.  What are you thinking?  Go to members.aol.com/goneashley  .  And, go to www.purevolume.com and download our MP3s.  THEY ROCK!

Now, on a more serious note, I applied for graduation today.  Talk about an overwhelming sense of nostalgia and wonderful memories that I have had for the past 5 years.  I can still remember being a naive freshman at Hudson Valley.  I remember all the wonderful people I met and the things I got to do."

"event","An update, yeah, it's about time.  Well, the week was fairly busy.  A lot of work, our company was down a ton of hours worth of man power, so was Hannaford.  But, we pulled through.  In particular, this Saturday Nate and I spent the entire day in the freezer.  It was a hard day, but the work got done in a relatively timely fashion.  On top of all the recent time spent in the freezer, our manager Jamie asked us to fill in for the next few weeks in the freezer because two of our new hirees did not work out.  One quit, the other said his car got stolen.  See yah...  However, my managers are cool.  They are the kind of guys that are so down to earth, level-headed, and genuine that if they asked us to march around the world with a pound packs on, we'd reply, ""Right behind you, let's do it.""

During the entire week, we hit up Professor Javas quite a bit.  I've been staying out a lot lately, but it's been fun.  I've also had some very deep conversations with Kim and Sam.  Last night's adventure to the coffee house had an interesting twist.  Kim was drawing a tattoo on me.  I acted as if she had stuck me and abruptly jerked back my hand.  She let out a screech and jumped about three feet.  She was so embarrassed.  I felt like a jerk for embarrassing her, then she slapped me.  WHAM!  She made my face all blotchy...  But, I did pull some kind of a prank on her, I deserved it.  Sam offered to slap the other side of my face to make it match.  It's nice to know my friends care about me.  They'd rather see both sides of my face slap happy red.  What are friends for...? lol.  Then we went to Rob and Tiffany's apartment.  Taboo is the schiznit!  It's absolutely hysterical having people yell out random words.  And, I love some of Sam's shirts, the subliminal advertising is so funny.  Yeah, and getting Sami to decribe the word bust was hysterical too.  ""What are these?"" she asked, shaking herself.  FUN TIMES

Well, our game went relatively well today.  We ended up winning 12 to 9.  We were behind 6 to 2 at one point.  I actually got to see a kid I went to Hudson Valley with.  Even though I got made fun of a lot in high school.  Mike was always kind to me.  He's great that way.  ""A"" league hockey...fun stuff.  Besides the fact that the guy at Kemp's that was sharpening them butchered my skates, but I was able to get a new edge put on them.  

You know...I love my friends.  You all know who you are."

"event","Okay...I have been wicked lazy about updating this journal.  This entry is going to be very long, so brace yourselves!  I had a great New Year's Eve.  I hung out with Rodney and Laura and her family.  It was great.  Old friendships never die.  I drank Killians' and Whiskey Sours, and watched an old copy of our senior play.  We were laughing like crazy, partly because of the movie and partly because we were slap happy drunk too.

We'll fast forward to Saturday.  I went to work and hung out with Rob, Tiffany, and Sami.  We played Taboo and could not stop laughing we ate pizza, played American Idol for PS2 and I got my pants caught in my zipper.  Yes, you heard me right, I got my drawers stuck in my zipper.  Man, it was pain to get them out...it was an up and down battle, but I won.  Then, that same night, my band threw me a surprise birthday party.  Except, my birthday is in July.  But it was kind of an appreciation party.  They were awesome, it was held at Sue's house.  Jeanette made dinner and we played ""games"" (cough cough...) and watched movies.  Yeah, we all got a little intoxicated, but it was cool and we camped out there.  Sunday was a blur, I played video games and hung out online.

Today was just like any other work day.  We got out a little early.  Sam and Kim were supposed to come down, but the roads were really bad.  I totally understand that they wanted to stay in, in fact, Kim just had a car flip across the street from her house.  The driver landed her car in a creek, upside down and she was unconscious, she actually needed to be recussitated by a man that had stopped to help her and her mom.  What a good Samaritan.  Luckily, the driver, and her dog are on the mend.  Man, I am glad they didn't come tonight...I could not imagine if that type of accident happened to either one of them.  They are both so special, I would be torn to say the least, if something happened to them.

Well, I get to play the my favorite character tomorrow, the hockey bum.  I need to get in some serious ice time in preparation for the league which will be opening up this weekend.  It will be a blast.  I cannot wait to play in some competitive hockey.  Hopefully my friends will come out and cheer us on."

"event","Well, how do you like that?  It's New Year's Eve, here I sit in my boxers before I head out to my friend's house for the evening.  I had a good day at work today.  We got out a little early and I was able to hit the weight room for a half hour.  It felt really good to burn out my muscles.  I hit the preacher curls and military press with dumbells.  

Last night was very relaxing.  I met Sam over at Professor Java's for a late night latte.  She was a little late.  If you want to know why, hit up her journal entry for today...lol.  She's such a sweet girl, with a genuine personality.  Wait, did I just say that?  Did I really just say that I had a latte?  Only yuppies drink latte, right?  WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE MIGHTY BULL!?  Am I turning into a prep?  No, I'm still the same.  I still wear Carhartt, I still work at the warehouse, I'm still the punk rock kid from Chatham, I'm still grounded in my morals.  However, ever since I met Sam and the Clifton Park crew, I've been trying new things.  It's been fun.  Looking back on this year, I guess I have a lot to be thankful for.  In particular, meeting so many cool people that are at Siena now.  Who would have thought that all the people I would meet would be so into punk music and so much like me.  I had grown weary of the upstart, snobby, and left wing yuppies that had permeated the campus.  Finally, there are some really promising people.  Also, the people from Rockitt Productions go to Siena.  I think this school of ours needs a punk rock enema.  I think my band and a few others would be perfect candidates to give it to the school.

So alas, it's new year's.  I would love to share a kiss with my beloved when the clock strikes twelve.  However, I will have to wait yet another year for this dream."

"event","Well, it was another uneventful day at work.  However, sometimes a calm day is a welcomed change.  It's nice to have a routine during the day at the warehouse, then before you know it, you look up and it's time to go home.  I was put in the freezer unexpectedly today, two of our regular workers didn't come in.  Apparently, they both had a stomach virus that was making the vomit and another guy quit.  Jordan to the rescue.  Actually, Jordand and Nate (my brother) to the rescue.  We busted out some hours of man power in a short amount of time.  The frozen department was back up to speed in under two hours.

The other day I heard about an army drill saergent that was crushed to death.  However, the means by which he died were pretty funny.  He had gotten a new hammock and had brought it back to the base.  He was so excited about trying it out, they he strung it up between to rows of lockers that lined a certain part of hallway.  The saergent got in and as soon as he had put his full weight on the hammock, the lockers pulled away from the wall, crushing him almost instantly.  Pretty crazy.  If you think that is wierd, go to www.darwinawards.com 

Nothing really is going outside of work to speak of.  Sometimes having down time is really good.  I have to be domestic tonight and get some cleaning done.  

A while ago my friend said that I need to get back in the dating game.  He continued saying that since I am 22 and had not been on a real date in about 6 months that I needed to start getting serious and settlind down.  YEAH, RIGHT!  I'm practically just beginning my life, I can't even believe he mentioned ""settling down"" and the age of 22 in the same sentence.  However, the real question is, do I really want a girlfriend?  If the opportunity presents itself, possibly.  It all depends on who the person is.  It's not that I don't want to date, I just don't want to go out with a girl and give her the wrong idea.  Don't get me wrong, I have considered a relationship with certain individuals, but I don't want to make a mistake.  I got burned the last two times.  For now, this mighty bull is not corralled."

"event","Man, what a day!  It was an absolute blast.  Today in church, we prayed for one of our friends that is going on a missions trip to Chile, to a remote part of the mountains.  God be with her as she ministers to people who don't have much outside contact, even with their own countrymen.  God be with her.  Then, Seth and I went skiing with Russ and Stephanie.  We even met up with two of our buddies from Coeymans Hollow on the mountain.  It was good to see them and share the evening.

Last night was a blast too.  We all went to Professor Java's in Colonie.  A friend of Sam's thought that I was gay and that Sam was trying to hook me up with a mutual male friend that had come out with us.  Talk about fun times.  But still, Sam's friends were mad cool and it was good to hang out and spend time together.  I also cannot believe I got mooned by Royce.  That kid is nuts.  He's hysterical though, I wouldn't trade him for anything.  

Well, it's another day of work for me tomorrow people, goodnight."

"event","Coolness.  I get to have a second wave of presents tonight from my immediate family.  We did not get a chance to open them last night because we went to Boston yesterday.  Nate already showed me part of the gift he bought for me.  A hockey stick, I'll get plenty of use out of it.  I like getting practical gifts.  I ask for things that are practical and that I will use often.  I hate getting useless junk that sits and collects dust in my room, unless it has something to do with my interets, like a sports or movie poster.  So far, Seth gave me Less Than Jake's ""Borders and Boundaries"".  Every song on the album rocks!  Nate and Seth you are the best!

Aside from everything else, work today was pretty light.  We got out a little early in fact.  It was kind of cool to step outside of the warehouse and actually see the daylight, I enjoyed the sunset.  For the last two months we have been getting out around dark.

Well, with Christmas in the past for this year, it's time to start looking forward to the new year.  It seems everyone has a New Year's resolution.  Some propose they will lose weight, others will quit drinking (sort of), some will say they will stop gambling or they will get out of credit card debt.  Some vow to better themselves by taking classes in Yoga or the Classics, and even undergoing plastic surgery in an attempt to obtain a more perfect figure.  Despite the things one can do to better him or herself, the most important thing is to be happy with who you are.  If you don't feel confident in your personality, the personality that makes you so unique, the personality that shows others around you, exactly who you are, then nothing you do to yourself physically or mentally will can help you.  In short, if you aren't enough with out it, you will never be enough with it."

"event","Well, we made the yearly pilgrimage out to Peabody Mass for our Christmas Day celebration with my dad's sister and his family.  It was good to see my relatives, seeing how I had not seen my cousin in particular since the summer.  My uncle and aunt's house is like a zoo.  They have three dogs, four cats, and a parrot.  The parrot is the dumbest thing with wings on God's green earth.  It does not shut up for anything, it just sits there sqwauking all day.  Finally, my uncle threw a pillow at it and knocked it clear off it's cage.  The bird did not utter a chirp after that.  My uncle and aunt's dogs are really cool, they are really calm and love people.

The only thing that sucks about Christmas is the monotony of driving clear across the state of Massachusetts.  Oh well, it was good to spend some time with my brother.  Christmas dinner was excellent, ham and turkey.  Oh yeah, and don't forget the half dozen or so helpings of dessert that I had either...man, I love the holidays!

In my cousin's room we played SSX III Snowboarding for PS2 all day, man it was a blast.  It far outweighs the features in the previous two versions.  Besides video games and what not, it was good just to kick back with Matt.  Since all four of us work and go to school, any family time in any capacity is welcomed.  

As the week and the Christmas season winds to a close, I love to think about how the savior of humanity was brought into the world.  Jesus Christ came to bear all the sins of humanity, no matter what they were.  He was a perfect living sacrifice, so that we may be forgiven and start a new life, with him as Lord of our lives and so that we can spend eternity with him.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, Jesus rocks!

I was hanging out with Rob, Tiffany, Sam, Scott, and Mike all night last night and I did not get home until 2 a.m.  Then again, it was fun.  We were going to go bowling, but the leagues had the run of the place, and we would have to wait for an eternity to get a lane.  So instead, we went and shot pool.  It's a fun game.  Then, I had to get up and go to work the next morning.  Between betting on games of 4-ball, hitting Sam and Tiffany with snowballs, racing each other around Clifton Park, me getting smacked by Sam because I was picking on her, and Friendly's, it was a fun night.  Sam's new nickname for me is ""Ass""...lol, she's crazy.  

Man, the warehouse really has a way of sucking the life out of all who work there.  I got shifted to two different departments today.  It gets pretty cold working down in the meat locker.  But we got out early, now everyone can go home, and enjoy the night.  Everyone gets Christmas off, but we'll be back on Friday for a full day.

Tomorrow we head to Boston to visit some family.  It's quite a hike to go all the way over there for a day trip.  However, it is family, and no matter what I'm of the opinion that you drop what ever you are doing if it means spending time with your family or if there is a crisis involving your family, immediate or otherwise."

We played a show last night, but it did not go well at all.  We had some technical difficulties and you can never plan for those.  You just have to keep playing as if nothing happened.  That and the crowd was not friendly in the slightest.  A buddy of mine from a rather successful band came over to me after we finished our set and said, ""Sometimes Jordan, you just have to bend over and take it in the ass.""  I replied, ""Yeah, some days are just like that.""  No matter how good or bad a show might go, the most important thing is to keep a sense of humor.  It helps to put situations and ordeals in perspective.

What made the show a lot easier is having my buddies there to cheer me on.  Thanks Mike, Scott, Bob, Sami, Rob, and Izzy, you guys rock!"

"event","Well, after some much needed hockey yesterday, some shopping, some studying, and watching the Rangers, I finally have time to give some updates.  Man, playing hockey felt great yesterday and I needed the excercise.  I played well for about the first half hour or so, then it was all downhill.  We didn't have many subs, so I had to skate some extended shifts.  It was cool, just having the ice beneath me felt great.  Mike was playing with me, my buddy was out there tending net, like always.  I even put one past him.  I can't wait until Men's league hockey starts up.  It will be cool to be in some real game situations again.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, I miss playing for the Saints this season.  

Nothing works up an appetite for me like hockey.  After we ate, we accomplished some much needed Christmas shopping.  Now, I love people, but sometimes crowds really get to me, sometimes.  

Then, I got to spend some time with my friends whom I had not seen in a long time.  I had not seen Rodney in over two weeks and Laura has spent the semester in California going to school.  We shared stories of the last three months over ice cream.  It was great to see them again.  There is nothing like friendship on this earth.  I believe friendship to be a blessing from God, as a reminder that he loves us.

Well, time to study for an exam.  Then I have to work from 1 until 8, then a birthday party for a friend.  It should be an interesting day."

"event","Man, what a day!  I have been procrastinating about studying for my spanish final for about the fourth day in a row.  However, I decided that my slacking was becoming detrimental to my education and that I should get off my tail and hit the books.  I went to the review session and got a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding cleared up.  Plus, I got extra credit which is always cool.

Before and after my review I was able to chill in the lounge with all my buddies.  It was great to see them, since we all have been going our separate ways, since the end of the semester started coming.  Man, Adam Coffin has some crazy stories...some of them are so hysterical that we laugh until we cry.  A lot of his stories start out as, ""Well, I was really drunk, really high"", or a combination of the two.  He's funny, he provides a huge dose of comic relief when he comes around.  It was crazy, all of my buddies that I had not seen in two weeks just randomly appeared out of nowhere.  It was great to see all of them.  We all watched ""Tommy Boy"" on TV, such an awesome movie.  

Yeah, so about a two to three weeks ago, a certain girl gave me her number.  Right in front of my buddies in the lounge, she came in and gave me her number.  I was impressed that she had the courage to give it to me in front of everyone.  However, it did feel a little awkward.  Sometimes when we are all in the lounge, she camps out with her friend just outside the lounge.  I feel like a jerk, but I tried to avoid her.  I mean, I never did call her.  The last thing I wanted to be asked when Justin was with me was, ""Hey, how come you never called?"".  Then I get to explain why.  I mean, this girl is very sweet and extremely genuine.  But at the same time,  I want to remain single...until I think I have found the right girl.  Of course, dating does not hurt, but I don't want to give a girl the wrong impression, especially when I think she likes me.  

Man, life is crazy sometimes.  I just don't want to get caught up in a relationship and regret it...for many reasons.  I do have a crush...well, a few, but I doubt very highly either of them will go anywhere.  But hey, you never know.  It's a longshot, but it just might work."

"event","Well, I have started an online journal.  It should be pretting interesting.  However, I think if I can keep a running account of all the adventures and, other crazy mishappenings, and stunts that happen to me day to day basis, it will be hysterical to look back on.  And who knows, maybe one day I will be able to put this collection of entries into a piece of writiny, memoirs if you will.

Okay, let's start with the basiscs.  I'm in a band, I sing, I love music.  I have an awesome group of friends and you know who you are!  I love sports and I deeply miss playing hockey for the Saints this season.

As for women...man, don't get me started.  Yeah...I have a few crushes, but the only problem is that my crushes have boyfriends.  Alas, I am single, but being single has it's high points.  I can go and flirt and do anything I want.  I am tied down in no way.  After my last relationship, I realized I actually had time for myself on the weekends.  Crazy concept, huh?"

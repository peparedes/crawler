Yay for being able to feel such deep emotions again.  I feel like I am bleeding from a thousand wounds.  This will teach me to build expectations.  This language is cursed by the people that used it, I swear.  We build the most filthly implications and understandings into things which really don't hold any more reality then the literal use of the words.

Still, to be so blatently misunderstood by my snake path partner.  This is food for thought.  It means my understanding of the snake path needs to be revised.  

Ultimately, I guess I'm too happy with what's been happening to really care that much.  Maybe it's as simple as her emotive responses and impulses are inteferring with the appreciation that for the first time in all the time she's known me, I'm actually truly happy.

What I found today re-arranged my whole world.  I love myself.  I love this world.  I spent a full day just following the pull of the world and Being - and it has rewarded me with meeting someone new that I have shared something new with and holds a spark so bright at our parting today that I have the most beautiful hopes without expectations.

Happy! Rain dancing and much loud (slightly? off-key) singing insued on my journey home afterward.  Then much chats of goodness with dear ones.  Extensive debates about ""how to save the world."", to simplify, with the roomie... and yeah, the lil bit of a stinker of being so grossly just passed off... infact, sooner then judge her for seeming to judge me, I might ask how she is and see why she might be in such an unusual state to of blown me off so quickly.

""An old man, going a lone highway,
Came at the evening, cold and grey,
To a Chasm fast and deep and wide.
The old man crossed in the twilight dim,
The sullen stream had no fear for him;
But he turned when safe on the other side,
And built a bridge to span the tide.

'Old Man"", said a fellow pilgrim near,
'You are wasting your strength when building here
Your journey will end with the ending days;
You never again will pass this way.
You've crossed the chasm, deep and wide,
Why build you this bridge at eventide?'

The Builder lifted his old, grey head:
Good friend, in the path I have come he said,
'There followeth after me to-day,
A youth whose feet must pass this way.
This chasm, that has been as nought to me,
To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be;
He, to must cross in the twilight dim-
Good friend, I have built this bridge for him"""

blinded eyes that I can no longer see,
My gaze gone long over the trees,
Stolen words like stolen hearts received,
All my soul swept away upon the breeze.

To realise,
All the illusions welcome,
To catalyze change,
They will despise.

To catalyze change,
They will despise.

The fire blazing extinguished,
Eternal quenching of a phoenix's wings,
The siren's song sings forever on,
For a heart of gold fills the soul,
Weaving magic over us all.

Revolving and disconnecting,
I fall through the hollow earth,
Tests of time gone untold beneath hands folded,
White robe with torn seams and blood stains,
Cindered shards are all that remain.

To realise,
All the illusions control them,
You become the same,
They will summise.

To catalyze change,
They will despise,
They will despise you.

The beginning begat the end,
Ashes to grass and foes to friends,
Orbitting around our suns,
Falling into black holes,
In quixotic catatonic state we disolve

Evolve,
Slice the lid and let the eye see,
Forever beyond pettiness of you and me,
The third eye sees; no judgment,
Forever free.
Phoenix reborn, eternal, always will be.

To catalyze in vain,
Bringer of the change,
You will despise them,

To bring the change,
The grey men will despise you,
They will all despise you."

Each one changed me deeply and catalyzed changes that could only happen through such a truly felt emotion.  I believe the state of confusion that I had been in which led me on my stumbled pathway down the alley of red roses may of broken a few hearts on the way because of how flighty my heart was. 

Love is never found, and love is never lost.  It is something created and shared between people.  It is literally the spiritual emotional bridge that we build connections upon.  It hurts when these bridges decay, but the instances, the moments that are shared, live eternal.  They are not ""now"", but they always will be.  The very nature of our world defines that all things created are eventually destroyed.  Everything is temporary.  Which acceptence of this I now look at each time I've felt love and I am happy for having been blessed with it so many times.  To me, that is the most important side of it.  This is my very human perspective.  I carry now the beauty of every such occasion, the magic the swirls between two in that split moment when such is formed rather then focusing on whatever else happens in other moments.

They are the moments I hereby store in memory.

((OVERVIEW))

Bob and July are dating, very close relationship, an established couple.
Mirielle is a very close friend of Bob and also spends alot of time with July.
John is a former friend of Mirielle's and a friend of July.

--------------

Mirielle tells John about how much she despises July, truly hates her.

Mirielle tells Bob all about how John is really very wierd and cannot be trusted.

Mirielle spends time inforcing the view that she really loves Bob and July they mean everything to her.

John can tell something is wrong and asks around and gets told all the things he's apparently done.

Bob understandably doesn't want someone that's unstrustworthy arould his love, so says that John has to stay away.

John approaches Mirielle and tries to make peace as things are out of hand in his opinion.

Mirielle ignores John's attempts and talk to more of his friends in an attempt to tell them how horrible he is.




.... That's about as far as I've got with the story outline.  I'm not even sure yet if it'd look better from a sitcom irony viewpoint, or as an intense soap-opera drama.  

I'm looking at suggestions for how to continue the storyboard from here.  It's only going to be quite a short piece, so I'd say it's coming up to something which'll be the beginning of the end of the episode.

I'll also be adding alittle bit of a detective twist once I flesh it out.  Such as building a tree of evidence to lead to the motives of the individuals.

"event","Just when people were starting to convince me that we're more then machines I find that scientists have now accepted and started futher studies on a project that's been running for quite a few years now... A REG, Random Event Generator, a little black box which has been spitting out ones and zeroes... which they have successfully shown can be influenced by human thought as to the number sequences, and it's been monitored and has successfully had major spikes and every major world event since the time of it's invention...

We're talking recession.  We're talking september 11.  We're talking tsunamis.

They have begun work on a shared consciousness project and are actually having results.

This little black box is capable of reading the ripples our collective conscious causes ""Before"" an event actually happens - but for the moment they have no way of knowing where/what is going to happen.

I now just need to find enough money to go over to the UK and get in touch with the scientists that are running this project.  I feel I've got a few things to share with them now the scientists have actually been forced to accept certain things.


It's the start of cracking the mystery of precognition.  Our brains are obviously capable of detecting the same fluctuations in the chaos as this machine but we then go a step futher, we are innately aware due to the conditioning of our environment of the waveform that a series of anomalies take and thusly we can often ""predict"" what is going to happen before it occurs.  Sometimes we are right, sometimes it's something similar or equally personally important but nothing like what we thought.

It's all about the understanding of the wave, knowing what anomalies correlate with which events.

Which now brings me to grinning like a fool.  Through my secondary education, I kicked ass at all high end maths.  I'd look at an equation, groan and carry on like a mule for about 20 seconds, then write the answer down.  I could never show the working, and it's because I rarely new how I'd come to it and thus I eventually got failed.

That last is mainly just a random comment on a thought I had while writing the rest ;)

This evening I began cleaning up my sty and after that there is plans to re-arrange the house somewhat and once that is done start cleaning the rest of the house.  It'll probably take me the whole of the night with the exception of time that I'm eating dinner, showering, and doing the washing.

I abhor my ability to multitask so well, because while I'm doing this I can't stop my brain from churning constantly.

Questions, lots of questions.

Between the misunderstandings that carried on for the past 9 months or so, and my own need for my moments of solitude I've found myself in a position of being rather well and truly alone as of late.  My dear close friends have moved house and are now out of easy contactable range and all of my newer friends I had made have drifted due to one thing or another that arose.

Used to savor my solitude so much - yet now I am lonely.  Lonely and reflective, sitting here trying to retrace my footsteps and see exactly my actions.  Specifically my role in everything that I would of sooner of happened other ways.

I do not regret the path I have taken this year gone, for each moment I have walked with fullness of conviction and meant my every action.  I've made quite a few mistakes, though I tend to see them more as learning opportunities - and thusly feel I've learned from it quite well.  Yet, my reflections are in solitude and not in discussion where they belong.  

I've been called creepy, I've been called power hungry, I've been called a stalker and all manner of things.  Even in my solitude these accusations that have attributed to my current position bring me to smile a wry smile of irony.  Mirth at it, too.  Such judgement and the people that lay the judgement - with the myriad of issues upon their own plates, they thought for a moment that their eyes could understand what I was experiencing and all the convoluted conflicting emotions that I was simply doing my best to try and work with and understand?  Perhaps, futher reflection here - they never thought they could understand.  They simply didn't even bother to try, too caught up in their own problems and their own issues.

I bled for months on end and there were but two things that served as reason: following my heart, and following my code.  I did everything to try and set things right in every misbegotten sordid affair that my path saw me stumble upon.  Therein lies part of the lesson I've learned, and that's to just let things be.  

I tried so hard to help so many people, that so many others - including some I was trying to be there for, thought there must of been some other ulterior motive, that there must of been some reason for the way I was acting other then simply the fact that I honestly cared.  Well guess what, there never has been.  Each time I've bled for someone, I've done it through love and compassion.  Never anything more, never anything less.

Over the passage of months, as it was forseen by myself and a brother both - the macroverse in which I was existing, that minature ecosystem was slowly turned into being directly hostile toward me.  When enough of your environment starts attacking you, even the herbivores shy away and leave you alone - if for the fact they don't want to be a second meal, or perhaps just they are scared of all the attention being paid to you it's irellevant.  Nice guys do finish last.  That much I now have had concluded my study on.  You try to be there, selfless and honest - caring, kind and compassionate and just being genuine to your nature.  In return you are used, expected of, judged and manipulated.  And that's okay.  

I expect nothing.  I simply wanted to say all of this where those which have been a part can read it.  

Out of all the new friends I've made in the past year, I've managed to keep about four of them.  My own lack of understanding, and once I was depressed to an extent my own apathy(confusion?), drove away a few people which were sincere - and a whole lot of others were sent packing by the mountains of bullshit that were like so many holograms of demons piled upon me.  -- This got me down for quite awhile, I feel the bonds I make quite deeply and when they are severed on such short notice I bleed tremendously; then I realised that indeed the ones I have kept are likely the only ones that ever really saw the true me - and thought I was worth whatever sacrifices they may of made to keep in touch and remain a friend.

My friendship may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I've always been true to everyone to the best of my ability, I've always strived to be me.  

Now... just sad.  Some of the most incredible, beautiful people that ever walked across my path.  They stopped for long enough that I got comfortable with it, and now they are gone.  The dearest ones left me with real things as well as the memories and I strive to find happiness there rather then sadness in the void that I feel in their absence.

At times like now though, I bleed so much I cannot ignore how deeply I feel the wound.  

All for love.

"event","Another brief update - about to be working 7 days straight starting with today through to friday coming... 9-5 on most days.

I'm out of debt to all but family now, which is a good thing and a huge weight off of my back - it means every cent I earn isn't already allocated like the fortnight before I actually receive it.

It'll be about another month before I make it back out to Faith again as I simply cannot justify wasting any money at all at the moment though as soon as finances are getting a bit better I look forward to coming out to catch up with the people that matter to me :)


<<Warning : Autotype coming now, whatever comes out comes out>>


Been asking myself a question that I've had with me for at least fifteen years once again.  Why do people stay in situations, primarily relationships, that they really are not happy with as a whole.  They get some satisfaction from it, be it simply having someone who pays continual attention to them, or the sexual gratification, or perhaps even just somebody to talk to... but they convince themselves that it's love, and that's how they find ""love lost"" in a relationship.  Love is never lost, it's something that never changes no matter what happens.  It's something which is never betrayed, as there's not even any thought of the possibility.  If these words speak to you, offend you, hurt you, anything that enters your ""self"" then you know there is some measure of truth for you in what I say.  I've now walked away from alot of hopes I held because people are simply too stubborn to accept the things they feel and insist on living on in a false little realm when they tell themselves that they have what they desire and that they are happy, meanwhile all the while bemoaning the situation.  

Well, enough is enough and Chandos is free of strings.  I'm not holding my breath anymore for anything or anyone to come around to themselves and their reality rather then the illusion they build.  Yet this said, my wish is that regardless, for themselves, that they do - even if it will no longer impact on my life.

Keep safe all and I hope the sun dawns in your world.

Passed all the tests I'll win all the races,
Words spoken are that and naught more,
Only act when feel greater good in store.

Where on your throne of lies you rule,
With heart and mind and spirit I'll duel,
Tumble the crown of deceit by ignoring a braying mule.

Between darkness and light there is nothing to fight,
Perspective only - defines what we choose to be right,
Behind the view all wish to be right,
Others miscommunication and plight we ignite,
Painting those different from us as black as night,
Yet the power of time sets all things straight,
Your shallow lies and feeble cries it will irradiate.
Poison the water from which friends do drink,
As they bleed at the well - Success! you think,
Yet malicious intentions bespeak hollow conventions,
Gather round all ye compassionate and witness my true intentions.

Eyes of youth blinded by the pain and loss of past,
Thinking self so wise; leading this maturity class,
Yet for the poisoning of my wells you may well be last,
Strangers and friends with sour looks turn to me,
It's poisoned water from my well they drink; my action they think,
So sup upon another plate filthly wyrmtongue fiend,
Whom I did liberate.
The passage and power of time will set this straight,
Malevolent will manifested will never remain;
Cease your lamenting of your prior pain,
Finally understand I am not he - never will be the same."

With perceptions our natures are not correcting,
Forever people judging and never accepting.

Prone to deceit and angst our lifeblood we crush,
Roaming and weak against the lamenting of trust,

"event","Where you wan to cry but you're too sulky to cry? This is going to sound ridiculous, and probably very stupid, but thats my evening. I may have to provide some back story (and by the way, hello again, livejournal, its been a long time, how are you? Im married):

So my dear husband Justin bought Rocksmith a while ago. Its a very fun way to try and learn how to play bass/guitar. Pretty intuitive, changes pace depending on your skill, et cetera et cetera. And he wants me to learn to play the bass to compliment his guitar. Im ok with that. I even think it would be fun to play the bass myself.

Problem: my skill is nonexistent. His is pretty damn up there. So when I play, I get HORRIBLY embarrassed at my poor playing. But he's right there, watching, and I know judging. And to top it off, he goes ""Well why dont you play more lessons?"" ... to which I try to explain that I'm very not comfortable with moving on to more and different lessons for more information when I cant even reliably accomplish the little things. Like plucking strings with two fingers and keeping a steady rhythm, it doesnt really happen. So I just want to practice that. No, he says, do the next thing, and that other lesson, why did you do that? You dont need to know that... Well I wanted to know what it was all about, I was curious how I was supposed to accomplish palm muting when Im plucking with fingers not a pick.

... needless to say its not fun anymore. At least not when hes there to see. Granted I am very proud of what Im capable of when I play with actual songs, but every time hes there I go right back to feeling like an idiot again. Which makes me turn the game off and then go into the room and sit on the bed to cry. Which I dont want him to see but I still want him to come in and check on me and give me a hug and ask whats wrong...

Im stupid, I know. Shut up.

It didnt happen anyway, hes been sitting here reading Trigun. And though my feelings are hurt he probably has no idea. In fact Im almost 100% positive he has no idea that im upset. And BECAUSE Im upset I cant even play he Elder Scrolls Beta that I really want to get some time to play with before it goes down. Because I have had no real time to myself for this whole weekend... yeah I know, its my birthday, but still. Three days, and I cant get goo solid play time for those three days anywhere?

Im going to bed. I feel like crud, and maybe if I just go to bed this whole thing can go away. Ill play some ESO tomorrow morning before I have to go do this thing with some coworker/kinda friends... Its a sex toy party and Im so not comfortable even hanging out with these people... Gotta go put the mask on. Ugh."

"event","I was driving home on the way back from dropping Justin off at work. I usually flip between listening to the radio and whatever happens to be in the cd deck at the time (which was Dethklock today). I was finishing Mermaider (great song) and flipped over to the radio. That song that's a remake of Cry Little Sister came on. Its not the greatest song in the world, its kind of bland as far as music goes, but this little story bit came into my head. So I had to rush home and start writing it before anything else made me forget. 

So, without Further Ado... Cry Little Sister

   It wasn't fair. Of all the families in the village, and there had to be two hundred, of all the people... They hated her. That had to be why they did it. Maybe she wasn't the best on the fields at harvest time, but at least she worked like they were supposed to. Not like some of the older girls, the little sluts. And her older brother was always the first to work and the last to leave...

   It's deep night across the remains of a once proud city. Few stone edifices are complete homes anymore, and huge houses that seem to have been three floors at least are reduced to one with layers of unstable rubble above. Between the cracks and in every abandoned nook and cranny the villagers made their homes. No use in building houses when these shells still stood. And, frankly, no one knew how they were constructed so no one could do better. Like a horde of hermit crabs they all moved in to these ruins, and had been there for as long as any of the oldest men could remember.
   
   Usually every window had a candle, everyone cowering from a superstitious terror of the dark as old and primal as the chaos before time. With wide eyes they would stare out into the darkness beyond their bastion of humanity. Wide open space in every direction, and darker than the blackest shadows. Sometimes the horizon is broken by more ruins like jagged teeth against the failing light of the sky, making the villagers shiver at sunset.

   Tonight there are none, although in the smaller houses a faint glow between the chinks of stone walls hints at light hidden further inside.

   On one night of the year the darkness must be allowed the streets. It has to be done, for the safety of the rest of the year. On this darkest night every year some of the men would disappear, in a tight group. They silently leave their houses with grim faces and walk in the same direction out of town. Then mothers hold their children close and silent tears roll down their cheeks, quickly wiped away lest the children cry. No sound, everything is as silent as they can make it. Families so tense you can practically hear them vibrate as the huddle together next to a candle, terrified as rabbits with a wolf digging at their hole...

   But in one house there is no candle. There is silence, but if you listened at the door you would hear choked back sobs, and heavy breathing and the sound of a body scraping on the stone floor. There is no family huddled here. Just a little girl, heart and soul twisting between anguish and fear into a knot that makes her sick and cry silently while her mind screams; she writhes on the floor. 

   Her brother, the only other one living in this house, the only family there was, had heard the summons. He left only a little while ago. She had pleaded with him, begged and cried. Someone else could go in his place. Why did the men choose him to be among their group? He couldn't leave her, not alone, not now. There were plenty of bigger families. What if he didn't come back? The black, all the darkness, it was right outside. It would get them, it would get her, please don't go...

   At dawn some of the men would return. Sometimes almost all of them. But always, at least one would not return. The others would come home as silently as they left, looking dirty and tired, with a hollow eyes. They never talked about where they went, or what they did there. No one knew who would go or who would come back. Not until dawn.

  She grew tired, and her body stopped moving on the floor. Only her tears still flowed, and her soul felt as if it was flowing out in those tears, leaving her empty. She knew, deep in her heart, that he wasn't coming back. He might be the only one, but he wasn't coming back. And then it would just be her, the little child alone. And the women would look at her with the same disdain they gave her mother when the three of them sought shelter from the darkness in this place.

  <i>Sister...</i> She brought her head up, straining to see more than vague outlines in the shadows. There was no candle here. But the words had been there, whispered just beyond the quiet. She wiped her eyes and her nose on her sleeve. She <i>had</i> heard it...

  <i>Little sister...</i> Now she knew she had heard it. The voice had been close, but fading away out the door as it echoed. She rushed out and peered through the cloth that clung to nails on the door at night to keep them closed. A warm wind blew dust across the streets, lit by a half moon that gave everything a sinister edge. 

  ""Big brother...?"" she whispered out into the night. She slunk back, terrified, when some dust brushed her cheek, almost like a hand. After a few deep breathes, she came back, unlooping one corner from the door so she could sneak out. It was him, he was calling to her! Maybe she could take him home, find them before they left the village and bring him back.

  There wasn't much light, but the wind hadn't buried all the footsteps yet. It looked like everyone else had stopped by the house, and then left with her brother. She bit back another sob and grabbed her cloak from the hook by the door. He had made it for her, after mother had died...

  The footprints were almost in a straight line, out from the village. The wind was picking up, hot in her eyes as she squinted to see. This was the dust season. The crops had just been harvested, and the next few months would be empty, a winter of dry heat. Any remaining green crumbled under the scorching sun, and this was getting in her eyes. The track slowly disappeared under the wind, until there was nothing left to follow.

  Emptiness... no tracks, no light, and everywhere looked the same. Terror began to squeeze her heart again, and tears began again. But no sound. No one knew why, but you kept quiet in the dark. It was fear, and even though you didn't know the reason, you didn't argue with it either.

  <i>Come to me, little sister...</i> Again it came, and she turned to follow its echo. It had to be him! It sounded like him. She ran, afraid, hoping at any minute to find the men walking wherever they went. But instead was a half buried house, seemingly sunk into the ground. Light was coming from inside. She hurried over as fast as her little legs would take her. She found them!

  There were people coming out, and it dawned on her that she would get in big trouble if they knew she was out here. Not only was she not old enough to go anywhere alone, but she was a girl. This was a man's work, everyone said. No one's mother knew where they went, only that they had to go. So she hid by a fallen stone. She would find her brother in the group then run up and grab him. He wouldn't let anyone hurt her. He promised every night when she got scared.

  So many coming out. Maybe only one would get left behind. This was good news! Maybe...but her brother was not among them. And oh, their faces! Terrifying in their own right, with empty eyes that looked like they didn't see. Something awful had happened; the tragic but determined slump of their shoulders, like men who come back from war that had never killed a man before, and their blank faces all spoke a harrowing riddle that she might not want the answer to. What happened?

  As they disappeared into the darkness, she turned back to the lit building. There weren't supposed to be candles in the windows tonight, but here there were so many it was almost like daylight. And a long, howling cry came from inside. Where they all had gone in but her brother had not come out. It burst into the night air, held itself out, then slowly echoed away into the dark.

  Despite the ice old trembling in her spine, she went inside. The candles continued down a set of stairs, the only thing in the room. But it looked like someone was fighting here. Candles were lit everywhere, but here and there was wax trampled on the floor, and pieces of clothes. She went down the stairs, where the sound was. Her brother must be in trouble, and she had to help!

  Down the stairs, across a little hall, everything so bright it might as well be noon inside this place. Big candles that looked like they might burn and burn for years sat on shelves dug out from the walls. And, through an archway, where all the candles were leading...

  ""Big brother!"" There he was, looking beaten with has hair falling down around his face, chained by his wrists to the wall. He didn't look up, but his arms strained against the chains when he heard her voice... he didn't look right. Something was wrong. She stopped just before the circle of candles in the room. They almost covered the floor, ring after ring of candles. She had to step carefully between them, and they almost singed her dress. It was so hot...

  <i>Sister...</i> It wasn't quite his voice. It was bigger, like it echoed outside and inside her ears. <i>Don't be afraid, come to me...</i>

  ""What happened?"" She whispered, trembling a little, but coming closer through the light. Her foot accidentally knocked over one, and a few of the flames went out as they were knocked over. He looked up sharply as the glow on his face lessened. His eyes were white, and tears and sweat left tracks in the dirt on his face. His eyes looked burned...

  <i>They left me to it. I can't see anything but the dark... They gave me to it and the light is going to kill us both.</i> She ran to her brother's side, hugging him so tightly, for fear that something would take him away. It wasn't fair, it wasn't fair... The trembling wasn't fear, the tears weren't from sadness anymore. And she could feel her brother doing the same. He was cold, and sweating. <i>We were here first... and every year they kill us before we can rise to take it back...</i>

  ""Big brother... I hate them. I hate all of them. They took away your eyes. They took away your light, and they left us in the dark. Scared of the dark... Why do they hate us?""

  <i>You don't have to be afraid of the dark, little sister. Or them. Unchain me... Let me free and we will show them why they have to be afraid of the dark.</i> He was pulling at his chains, straining forward, but the candles seemed to be pushing him back. She nodded.

  ""I don't like the light anymore. It burns. And everyone is mean."" She kicked over a candle, where it sputtered and died. In a controlled tantrum she picked up and threw them, kicked them over, got on her hand and knees and swept them away. Behind her a steady growl rose up, louder as the lights went out.

  She turned just in time to see the chains fly from the walls as her brother roared like an animal. His burned out eyes seemed to glow from the inside, and he looked more like... like those monsters that ran in packs out on the plains, with grey fur and glowing golden eyes. But her brother was radiating darkness, and as frightened as her mind was, she walked up to him and hugged him. He looked down at her tenderly, and put a hand on her head. Already there seemed to be claws like knives from his fingers, but he was still the same to her.

  ""I love you, big brother."" She said. He picked her up and carried her through the hallway, all the flames from the candles turning black then sputtering out one by one as they passed. The smoke rose like incense to some god of darkness, spiraling is secret shapes. It made her sleepy watching it.

  They reached the edge of the village, where most of the buildings were too destroyed to make proper homes of. Her brother set her down on the ground in one of these. No ceiling, and only three walls, but the night air was warm. He told her to stay there until he came back.

  Maybe it was just a dream, she was so very sleepy it could have been, but her brother walked out and the shadows seemed to follow. As he went in the direction of the village rivers of blackness floated through the air after. And cries rose up from the houses. Screams and wails, and mothers pleading for their lives and the lives of their children. She could hear their voices rise on the wind, dying screams. And the blackness kept flowing there. Light fought with it, huge fires erupting from houses before they too became black and devoured anything they touched. It was awful, horrible. Her eyes were squeezed tight. She was safe, big brother promised no one would hurt her. She was safe. He promised every night. Just like mother had promised them both. She promised the dark would never hurt them. Until the day she disappeared, and her brother took care of them both...

  Dawn never came. It was still night when he returned. A great creature with muscled arms ending in wicked claws, covered in what looked more like pure darkness than fur. Huge fangs in a bloody muzzle... but when she opened her eyes it was just her brother, coming to get her. He took her hand and together they walked under the moon towards their house. No one was home, and in the streets shadows in the shapes of monsters roamed about. She held her breath, afraid and quiet.

  <i>It's alright, little sister.</i> He squeezed her hand and she felt better. She looked up and he was smiling at her, which made her smile too. His eyes were still burned, but he never ran into anything. And the shadows watched as they went by. Some came up to her, as if curious, but her brother waved them away. Maybe they weren't so scary...

  The sun never came up. The night lasted forever, and there were no candles anymore. But there was still light from the moon, and every day she could see better. The shadow creatures stayed, and there was no more burning sun on her back when she went out to play. Her big brother promised to protect her, but it wasn't the night they had needed protecting from. It was the evil people that wanted to hurt them.

  One day she looked in a mirror, and her eyes were almost as white as her brother's. She was so proud she ran to her brother to show them off. He told her they looked beautiful, why didn't she show her friends? And so she ran off to play with her friends, who didn't look so shapeless anymore. They had names and faces, and she loved them like a huge family.

  Once a year they all ran rampant in the streets, chasing wisps and shapes that looked like the kind of people from the village. Howling and laughing, they chased ghostly things as she watched them from the house. And her brother would roar and lead them, looking magnificent and royal in his body of darkness. He promised that someday she could join, and she couldn't wait for the day when she too could make those ghostly people with the lights go away."

"event","Time flies when... you get a new job that works you 7 to 2 Monday through Friday. ^-^ Yes ladies and gentlemen, Rae is no longer working in the fast food industry! *applause* Now I work at a call center, doing sales and retention for TiVo. Which is probably one of the funnest jobs I have had, and I'm not even out of training yet. X3

That said, can I go on for a minute about how really cool TiVo is? And not just because I work for them? Cause I couldn't afford a new one if I wanted to, but I got a factory renewed one and it TOTALLY beats out Daniel's Dish Network crap. I can record stuff just like regular, but I can watch Netflix, and youtube, and podcasts from my TV! Big screen baby! Totally awesome. And for some reason Justin loves the little beep boop sounds it makes... o.O 

Uriah's working there too, she's in the class after mine. They're a week ahead of us, since they started early, and I get a little bit of a heads up from her. I hope I can get in a morning schedule, because that would be the best ever. We could go to work together. And she could pay me gas money. XD

Currently I get a ride to work from Justin the ever-benevolent. He has to wake up at 6:15 to take me to work in the freezing cold. And if he isn't working, he comes and gets me too. Not a single complaint against me either. He's the best! But when he can't, I get a ride home from this guy in my class named Richard. He's almost flaming, and proud of being from Texas. Then there's another Texan, his friend Kim. I don't mind being friends with these people at work. Outside of work, however... they really aren't the kind of people I usually hang out with. It's not really my cup of tea. So I keep dodging their invitations. Its just not fun for me.

BUT going back to the love of my life, Justin was the biggest sweetheart on Valentine's Day. He bought me a white rose, and he made dinner. Cheese tortellini (however you spell that) and chicken in a nice red sauce... and I made the richest, most delectable chocolate cake you can imagine!!! It was just the two of us all day, and we did nothing but enjoy it.

Til I got sick. Yeah, and I'm still sick. Which is great, because I'm losing my voice and I have to take calls tomorrow. T-T I'm praying to god that my voice will come back. I really don't relish the idea of hacking up a lung into a customer's ear, you know? And that's on top of the utter terror in my gut at the idea anyway. I don't feel confident in the process, and so I'm very nervous. Very nervous. Very very very nervous. 

I know I shouldn't be, because I'll have help every step of the way, but I can't help it. I learn by doing, and then it takes me a little bit to get it all down. I'm not gonna panic though, because that doesn't help anyone (talking myself down).

On a completely different subject, Justin and I are looking for a new place to live. The lease is up in July, and we are gonna try and find a place just for the two of us. Cheap as possible, although in this town that doesn't really happen...

Wish us luck!"

"event","Oh, hello you sad, cruel little world. I had almost forgotten you existed. Again. But everytime I get so close to happiness I can almost touch it, you have to force your sickened cancered visage back into my sight.

I know that I work in a dead end, pride cutting job. no one wants to work in a fast food place, unless they're in high school and its their first job. I will never make any more than oh, about 7.50. Can anyone live on that? No. Have I been searching for another job like a crazy person? Oh yes.

Is anyone else in this fucking city hiring? Oh no... And some self-righteous fucker had to point that out to me yesterday. Nicely done. He implied that if I was intelligent I wouldn't be working here. Light and mocking and oh, it made my blood boil. I wanted to be childish, and throw some nasty burger at his head as he walked away. I wanted more to be adult, and stab him in the spine with a kitchen knife and render him immobile from the neck down.

If I may interject, and petition you to cease your rude, disparaging slander? And if I may say, in sweeter words that drip like poisoned chocolate, go fuck yourself? At least the second part you can understand.

Sometimes the world is so small. Or it is huge, but where I can go is small and the rest seems like its attainable in picture and story alone. Made up places that turn real when you visit, like maps in video games, they don't exist until you go there...

I worked ten hours yesterday. I'm not wired that way. By the end of it my mind is raw and aching, and I want everyone who walks in those doors to die. No warning, just fall. Your eyes can stare forever at nothing, just like they do when you walk up to me. And you think you're better than me?

I suppose it seems that way. Almost everyone who works there is so much younger than me. And so stupid... but I was that stupid once, just not in the same way. Don't be proud of drinking so much you've been to the hospital for alcohol poisoning. Multiple times. Your putrid liver must be rotting inside of you. You all spend your days getting stoned off your pathetic asses, and come to work with hangovers and bleary eyes... I don't belong here. I'm confined in a plastic case with all this refuse. I come home feeling like I'm covered with a thin film of so much filth.

And baby... my love i am tired. It's hard to be so optimistic when its so against my nature. I'm not the kind of person to look on the bright side. I don't want that silly silver lining, I'm grateful for the cloud cover. Don't try to tell me who I am or am not. Please. Just be there to pull me from the darkness when I fall. Hold me when I need you, let me know you love me still. It's all I'm asking."

"event","I don't much like Christmas. I enjoy giving gifts to my friends and family, and I like having the day off of work to spend with Justin, but everything else... can rot in hell. Everywhere I look are frantic people swarming the stores for those last minute ""must haves"". They push and shove and writhe en mass like a horde of insects in a small container. And for some reason their friction creates all this static stress that, even when you're not involved, still catches and frays your nerves. It's aggravating, to say the least. 

Combine that with every supermarket and retail store throwing terrible ads and obnoxious holiday themed jingles fraught with santa hats and snow and tacky sparkly bits in your face from every angle... I can't even get to my journals anymore without Best Buy putting their annoying we-think-we're-clever holiday tune parodies up first. Frankly, I don't appreciate it. If I see one more cheap plastic Christmas ad I will snap. They play christmas music at work too. The only relief I have there is the fact that I can't hear it behind the counter.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not all touchy-feely, warm-hearted spirit of Christmas either. That sentence made no sense, but you get the point. I'm not in for the warm fuzzy feeling and togetherness of family. I don't do that either. I suppose I treat it like a mass second birthday. It's the day of the year when I get to show my friends how much I appreciate them.

Justin is going to flip when he opens his. *evil laughter* I can't wait. That will be the highlight of my year, make no mistake. It looks... actually right now it looks like something from Dr Seuss, with ugly bright grinch-green colored paper and a red velvet bow tied around it. I love it. Much more fun than black and white snowflakes. ^-^ And I wrapped Milissa's in packing tape, because I know she did the same. Remind me to bring an exacto knife to open it with..."

Well, technically my gums hurt. I got my wisdom teeth taken out last week. So now my mouth is all tender, and I can't have soda or anything too hot. Or anything crunchy that'll get stuck in there. For a while my jaw even hurt when I opened it, but now its just that little area. It was creepy, but kind of cool. I could hear my teeth cracking when they pulled them out. Only two, thank god, but it's still 300 dollars I don't have. Oh, I got the rest of my teeth cleaned too.

Christmas agony. I've almost got everyone taken care of, except my sister. And some of my friends are getting me gifts and I have don't have the money to get them anything in return, so I feel awful!! I hate Christmas. Add to that the fact that the highlight of the season, Justin's gift, is MIA and I can't get ahold of the company and we have lots and lots of stress. Everything else is allowed to go wrong. But that... I'm gonna fight tooth and nail for this to be perfect. *sigh*

Work is going difficult. It snowed a shit-ton two days ago, and between that and the absolutely freezing temperatures there has been very little business. I've been sent home early two or three times now. I'm losing hours, man!!! I miss working with Milissa too, since most of the days we work together she has to go to the CSU games. Poo.

I was reminded again yesterday why I have cut off the er... whatever they've decided to call themselves... I was very bored and for some strange and inexplainable reason I called Nick. Nice shallow conversation for awhile, then he inevitably turned back to the break-up conversation. I hate that, his stupid self-pity. He said we didn't work out because I treated him like a child. And that was the cause of his present failures. If he didn't like it, he could have stepped up and taken his workload himself, not bitch about it like a spoiled diva. *shrug* I won't make the same mistake twice. I'm not calling him again, that's for sure."

Yes, we got the little kittens. ^-^ I love them so much (and sometimes want to kill them, but who doesn't?) and I'm so happy. We got them from a friend of Aly's, and they are two young sisters.

Luca is the black one. She has more elegantly shaped eyes than her sister, and at the moment is a little smaller. We'll see. She belongs to Justin, who named her after a character in Chrono Trigger. She's also the one who won't leave me and the computer alone right now. And now they're both all over the keyboard. Shoo! ^-^

Elphaba is a black tortoiseshell, and she's all mine. ^-^ I named her after the wicked witch of the West (obviously, who else has a name like Elphaba?). Elphy likes to lick, for some reason, and I chose her right off the bat because she looks kind of like my Mush did.

They both love to watch TV and video games, and more often than not trying to play with the people and things on screen. Computers too, as I've just found out. They're very friendly, and complete purr machines, but also very hyper and sporadic as well. Lots of noise and romping, especially when we're trying to sleep. 

Currently trying to solve that problem.

My mother was telling me yesterday about how she ran into my two best friends from high school.

I didn't say anything, but I was very stung. And its made me look back on all the people that drifted away. Back then, Jazzy and Megan were my closest friends. We were inseperable, and shared everything. I've never had a lot of friends, so to say I had them for years is an accomplishment. 

Mother used to say Jaz was a bad influence on me, or things like that. But then my mom wasn't doing a very good job at the time. And it turns out that I'm the poison in the pond. *smirk* I hope it made her sick. But after Jaz went to college, we grew distant, and I saw her again one summer and she wasn't the friend I knew. Of course somehow she and Megan are still friends. But it makes sense. I've gone in a different direction... but still... What happened, you know? People come and people go, but don't some things stay?"

I desperately hope Justin gets the kittens. I really really really want them... ^-^ Wouldn't it be wonderful? Kittens romping around the apartment, grown up cats lazing and sleeping with us on the bed? It would be wonderful. And Aly says the little ones are very very young, so Justin wouldn't mind them. Maybe Geno and Xeno won't be little imaginary pets anymore. ^^

On a different note, I've recently noticed something. I don't have any friends. Don't give me that look. I know I haven't had any friends and its never bothered me. It doesn't really bother me now but... its just odd. I have... two? And they're not even that. Milissa is my work friend, but she's been avoiding any after-work activity I can think of. And Aly... I don't really trust her. Anyone who can talk badly about other people when I'm there... what keeps her from talking badly about me when I'm not there? So I don't give her any intimate details, nothing she could use against me. So yeah, not exactly a real friend.

I was depressed yesterday, very badly. I wasn't even laughing at Big Bang Theory. And poor Justin had to put up with me. Again. But... I have posts from a long time ago about my spreading skin disease. And its worse than its even been. The left side of my face has rising eczema on the cheek, and its above my eyebrow too. And nothing has been helping the ones before it... So I know its only going to get worse.

I am not, and never will be, the beautiful woman I always wanted to be. The angel is scarred and disfigured. Hide my face in the shadows of my dark wings...

I need a better job, but I think this extra one is temporary, despite how much I might want it to be more. If I do both jobs, will I have a day to myself anymore? Or will I be working and sleeping all the time? But I think its my own laziness telling me that.

But I like having days off. Days to myself are wonderful; I can relax, write, read, draw, anything I want to. Its me time. On the other hand, its more money. And I don't really need a whole day, do I?

Well, yes. Yes I do.

Or the fact that work is mediocre. At best.

I would like to ask that anyone worried about the flip flopping of my moods disregard this post, as it is mostly angry ranting. It by no means reflects my overall happiness and, quite the contrary to making me unhappy, allows me to vent it out and move on. I am not depressed. I am not raging. Just getting something off my chest.

Thank you. We know continue to your featured presentation.

""And yes, I'm pouting because you didn't spend any time with me and Atty...""

The nerve. The brass balled nerve. Text me to beg from me, then follow that plea with an accusation. You self centered, selfish little whore. As if 45 dollars for your hotel room last week wasn't enough. I played nice with you when I saw you, even though being around you and your slut makes me want to vomit.

Do you have any idea of what goes on around you? Are you that naive? Do you really think that everyone is going to take care of you? Your imaginary life is pathetic, and you're the king of it all. You dole out favors of shit like they're priceless, and expect repayment in spades. You think so highly of yourself while you eat away at others like a worm. Your self centered universe is horribly flawed, and I can't wait to see it all collapse and fall on your head.

Don't ask me for anything. Don't even speak to me. I know you insulted me behind me back. All of you did. You called for me to join you while I was too far away to hear your slanders. Call me a slut? Your precious Atty will fuck anyone who offers and many who won't. Your whole ""relationship"" is a child's game, a sad mockery of life usually reserved only for little girls who play dress up in their mother's clothes and pretend to have weddings and families. 

And I have to sit back and smile, because you were the authors of your own destruction that weekend. All the screaming and childish fits, lies and backstabbing, all the fucking and sucking and disgusting existences that you lead... I was removed from all of it. While your days stank in putrid pestilent hell, I had the time of my life. And I'll continue to do so.

"event","It was an awkward time, it was an awesome time.

I went alone to NDK. Well, not exactly alone. I went with my coworker Milissa and her boyfriend. We stayed in this terribly expensive hotel that charges you for <i>everything</i>. Even parking. Good news was it was right down the street from the Marriot, so we could walk there in a few minutes.

I suppose I should back up a little and explain why I wasn't staying with Tory and Sarah and Nick and all of them. See, I had been, and still do, feeling estranged from my friends. All they did was talk about making costumes that never got done, and I had no job and no money. So while everyone was talking about what they were making for NDK, I wasn't even sure if I could go. The fun was slowly draining out of the whole process.

So at the convention, while I was running around and having fun, they were mostly in their rooms, and none of them looked like they were having that great of a time.

So, first day:

Justin was very sweet and let me borrow his car to go to the convention. I felt so bad, because he wasn't going and neither was Daniel. But NDK is the highlight of my year, and Justin knew that. He was so gracious to let me go. I left and after a very long boring drive got to the hotel just after seven. Unfortunately registration ended at seven, so there was little to do. But I did manage to snag a picture of a Monarch coplayer! ^^ I was only sad because I missed anime science theater. But I hung out with Milissa and her boyfriend. Amusing enough, he only just got got fired from the Taco Bell, the same one that Nick works at.

Second Day:

Lots of pictures, and lots of fun. There were so many cool costumes. Unfortunately, I can't get the pictures up yet. But I will. As I said, I didn't see much of the ""CIA"" (stupidest name ever). Not hide or hair of Nick and Haley, but that's ok. Maybe they'll get back together. I dunno. I wasn't able to do my hair, so I used the chained catgirl costume instead of Rinoa. Sarah hates it, and I don't care. The highlight of my day, however, was making the day of a fun little 17 year old Link cosplayer. He was from Salida, the only guy around who cosplayed. It was his first convention, and his birthday. He was drooling all over the shield I bought for Justin, because I couldn't find a companion cube. I searched all over, and it was the next best thing I could find. But he couldn't afford the master sword he so desperately wanted, and he was only 17. Every year I try and do something really nice for someone at NDK. I don't know why, but I think its because everyone was really nice to me on my first con, so I want to pay the favor forward to someone. So I bought him the sword, for his birthday and for the con. He was grinning from ear to ear, and gibbering like a boy at Christmas. It made me happy to make someone's con like that. He was so happy, and I'm glad I could do it for him.

I ran into Tory and Sarah and Atty in the Dealers room. They were rolling their eyes at me while they talking to him. Yes, he had a bit of a lispy voice, but that's because he was so excited about his sword. I really don't think it was fair of them. I payed Sarah the money I owed Tory to pay for Tory's room, and left as soon as I could. They didn't make me feel like I was welcome with them. I kept wandering around, taking pictures and talking to people, and I ran into AJ and her friend. We had lunch at Wendys, and talked and walked around a bunch. More pictures, and more friends I will probably never see again. ^-^ I bought a Pyramidhead wallscroll for the apartment. Love Pyramidhead.

I went back to the hotel, and it was cold and raining. ^-^ I missed all my friends, very much. It was fun, but not as fun as it could have been if everyone else was there. Milissa and her boy came back, and I got his camera and took a picture for him just as he proposed to her. It was very sweet, I'm very happy for the both of them. ^-^ She looked so happy, I almost cried just picking up the residual joy lighting up the room like glittering cherry blossoms. 

I missed Justin so much, I left that night to go home. Skipped the rave and went back home to my baby. Although it was one of the scariest drives I've ever had. The road was wet, and it wasn't slippery but it was hard to see the lines. And there was fog on and off during the drive. Top that off with a car I'm unfamiliar with and very very very scared of damaging, and I was terrified the whole way. ^-^

Justin loved his shield, so I'm very happy. I'm home now, and I feel like my emotional batteries have been recharged. I'm very very very happy. And I'm inspired to make an awesome costume for next year. ^-^"

"event","I don't want to look this up on the internet because when you do, you turn into a hypochondriac.

The past three times I have seen a movie at a theater, and once while watching Dead Space at home, a strange thing happens. My lips get all tingly and the muscles in one arm get kind of numb. Now, my arm doesn't specifically go numb. I can still feel it and everything, but it feels like the muscles aren't working. Moving my arm seems to take extra internal effort... I know I'm not describing it very well, but its never happened before. Breathing is fine, no more than any other time. Although I think maybe my odd nervous habit of breathing funny kicks in more and I'm just not noticing. So thats what I'm thinking (hoping) it is and nect time I'll just pay a lot more attention to it, see if that helps.

I bring this up just because I went and saw District 9 with Justin yesterday and it happened. Because yesterday was the celebratory day of our 6 months together. Technically it was Sunday, but we both worked and Monday was a better day for it. ^-^ So he took me to the Macaroni Grill, which is an expensive Italian restaurant, and we went to a movie after. The food was fantastic, and the chocolate cake so good it makes me shiver with ecstasy. I still have half of it in the fridge too.

It was very very sweet of him, and I know how difficult it is for him to spend money like that. We don't really have a lot to just throw around. I wish I could get it through his thick skull that its ok. We have what we need, and a little on the side, so he should be happier. ^^ But yesterday was wonderful.

I really like the way district 9 was made. The whole thing is set up somewhat like a documentary on the slums of a third world country. Except its aliens persecuted in terrible living conditions, not another race of humans. They can't go home, and no one wants them here. The story circulates around a manname Wikus who gets... infected I suppose, although I'm not sure that's the right term, with the genetics of the aliens and starts to become one. In the beginning he's a complete and total bastard, and it almost doesn't ever change up until the last moment. You still kind of hate him, the entire movie. Just a little less.

SPOILER ALERT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE!!!!! --> During the movie, he's promised by one of the aliens, named Christopher, to be fixed, turned back human. All he has to do is help the alien return to his ship. A little later, he's told that it will take three years. Christopher is desperate to take his son home and get help from others on his planet. When they finally retrieve the fluid needed to move a small ship from the government, Wikus knocks the alien out and tries to get to the ship with Christopher's son. It fails, of course.

Wikus manages to get a hold of one of the alien-operated robots after he screws up the little ship. At first, he runs away, almost costing Christopher his life. But he turns around and not only saves the alien, but sacrifices himself so that he and his boy could go back to their planet with the promise to return in three years.

Now, Justin and I are in a debate. There will probably be a sequel, but even if there wasn't, we are arguing about what will happen next. In my mind, it all depends on Christopher. Will he remember most the sacrifice to save him, his son, and ultimately, his race? If that's the case, then perhaps he will return with help. Wikus will be cured, and the aliens will take their people and leave. Happy Ending, which in the perfect world would happen. Doubt it. I think there would be a few skirmishes and a bit of a firefight. But if humanity doesn't totally piss them off, they'll take their people and go.

Justin thinks Christopher will remember more of the suffering and the slums. That he'll report back the bodies of the aliens tortured and tested on in the labs underground. So he thinks the aliens will come back and wage war, or at least severely decimate us before taking their survivors home. They have some pretty nasty weapons we've seen so far, so they are prepared to do it.

END SPOILER ALERT!!! --> So what do you think? Of course, you'll have to see the movie first. I'd recommend it. It was fantastic."

I think I'm jealous. *smile* Hear that, mother? I am jealous of you. Before I was born she visited Greece and Turkey. Last year she went to India on a mission trip. All this travel, she gets to see exciting new places; that's one of the things I've always wanted to do.

I can't complain, however. I've spent two weeks going all over England, and I spent the latter half of the second week in Paris, of all places. I have fantastic memories and probably at least a hundred photographs of all kinds of things. Most of which I have to keep to myself, because no one else would understand it. They weren't there, or they aren't me; it's unimportant. Either way, those two weeks are very precious to me, and probably the best two weeks of my life.

Let's see, what else... I had a hard day at work today. It wasn't a very long shift, but we ran out of custard and the shakes at the same time. As soon as they were gone, of course, everyone wanted them. So it was a bit crazy. But you know what, I still like my job. I went in with a good mood, and no one could do anything to dampen it. Which leads me to think that maybe good moods are a decision, not a product of circumstance. At least not completely.

I just wish I could get Justin to think that way. He always comes home from work so unhappy, even angry. He doesn't like his job, doesn't like having a room mate, doesn't like people in general. He has a very low frustration tolerance... And I think some of it is a choice to be angry. I know if he read this he'd probably get mad at me for saying so, but I think that's the case. You have to choose to lose your patience. You have to choose to hold on to your anger to the point that little things cause an explosion.

It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile.

I try and take that to heart, ever since I heard it. I know, I'm a walking contradiction, because inside I too hate people in all their sick and petty filth. But I can take the rage in and release it in other ways than hating my life because nothing goes right.

Here's what is right, my love:

- You have a very nice apartment that you and Daniel can afford
- Inside said apartment are two nice tvs and the latest game consoles, each with a plethora of games
- You have a computer and internet access
- You have no worries about food
- You own a nice car; it runs smoothly
- You have a supportive girlfriend who loves you with all her heart
- You're in the prime of your life and in good health
- You have a solid job that gives you good hours
- You make 11.50 an hour at your easy job!
- You have nice clothes. Yes you're style is ever evolving, but you have the means to buy new clothes for yourself
- You have good friends that have been with you for a long time
- You possess amazing artistic talent
- You're very intelligent, you have the capacity to be anything you desire
- You're handsome, witty, and charming (I don't care if you don't think so. You are ^^)
- You have a good relationship with your father, who you can call for advice on anything

Beloved, this is only the surface. I wish you could see this list again whenever you think your life is so terrible. Maybe it would cheer you up. Maybe it wouldn't, but I'm trying anyway."

I tell everyone over and over, you have to get up and keep walking. You're strong.

I am even perfectly aware that there is a steel core at the center of this bleeding hearted, psycho romanticist. I have borne deaths and tragedies so much worse than this, and kept my back straight. I have looked murderers in the eye and counted myself stronger. I have pulled myself out of hell, one agonizing step at a time.

Why then am I so crushed by this defeat? By any of these small battles?

Come on Rae, collect yourself. I will not let this break me. The time for crying is finished. If I continue to lick my wounds in the dark I will never move forward. If I want to stop being a burden, then I can carry my own weight, one way or another. In every story I've ever read, the hero tries his hardest to fix the problem in every way except the one necessary, because he doesn't want to do it; it's too hard, it costs too much.

But if the story is going to have a conclusion, if the problem is to end, the hero must gather all his remaining strength and do what has to be done. He has to rise from the ashes and conquer the world. It hurts, he's battered and bruised, he's lost everything. But with an iron will and strength of spirit, the hero overcomes everything and all is saved.

It's easy to destroy, easy to make a puzzle. It's easy to fall, easy to cry. What's harder is to wipe the tears off and get back up, to fix your mistakes and rebuild your life. By heaven and hell and everything in between, I have that strength. I am more than even I give myself credit for. The only thing keeping me back is me."

Is it possible to get sick from overheating? I walked about 45 minutes to the grocery store to see my friend Aly, and even with an umbrella it was much too hot. I wasn't even wearing long sleeves, so don't look at me like that. Her fiance works at said store, so we went there to get the van from him. She bought me an almond pretzel at the mall, for which I am eternally grateful. Those things are wonderful. We window shopped until it was time to retriever her fiance from his workplace.

Justing got off work at the same time. I knew he had been having a bad day at work, so I felt really terrible for bothering him like that. 

On the other hand, he's giving me hell right now. For nothing in particular. I know I shouldn't be irritated, but for some reason I am. Don't know why. I'm not angry at anyone or anything. I'm just... being quiet. But he thinks I'm angry. How do I tell him I'm just in a calm mood. It's not a bad thing. Quite the contrary.

I think maybe it started when I went to lay down about an hour and a half ago. I'm still not feeling well from the heat, and I thought it might help if I just rested in front of the fan to cool down. But all it did was give me time to think. Think about all the things I could easily have if I only had a job.

I desperately want a kitten, but I don't have any way to support the little creature. I could do it by myself, if I could have just held onto my job. Stupid girl, bite your nails and wait until someone comes along and fixes it for you. You can't just sit back and wait for someone to hand you something. Get over your fear, its not even real. It's just an escape, a bad excuse to be lazy. Get off your fat, lazy ass and move. Or are you really too stupid?

You worked in a place for those who are too challenged to work in normal society. Kind of funny that you can't seem to find a job in the normal world. Not so easy when everyone's just as smart, or smarter, than you, is it? You're not good for anything, you have never had a useful job. Sure, you worked for CIRA... because a church friend took pity on you.

And you won't go back to school because you want a job first. Because you know that when you get a job you will be too busy to go to school, and you can avoid doing something hard. What'd I tell you? Lazy.

There will be no one to blame but yourself, you know. When you finally run out of money, and everyone has to buy everything for you. A dead weight. And they'll resent you for it. You know, because you would resent them too, if they were doing what you are.

He will too. Resent you for the money spent, resent you for the constant annoyance. Do you really expect everyone to love you all the time? Do you? Can you do the same? Didn't think so. And when he's gone, your heart with him, how long will you cry in the basement, useless then are you are now?  Idiot. Stupid. Naive.

Perhaps your mother should have ended you too, just like the ones before you. One more death, and she would have had someone else, and you would never have been. Never written this. Those murders wouldn't have been commited. Your hands wouldn't be red. You wouldn't be damned for the remorse you don't feel.

Karma. Round and round and round, turn the barbed wire wheel. Again and again and again...

I was over at Aly, Mike, and Doots' place yesterday and they decided to watch this odd puppet porno. Puppet chick getting fucked by a puppet dog... I am scarred for life. That kind of thing can't be fixed. Ugh...

So Tory is gone... It's strange, now I can't call her and be all ""Hey, we need to get some fabric"" or ""Whatcha up to, I'm bored"" or stuff like that. She's all the way over in Utah... with Atty...

I don't like Atty. She's scatterbrained and irresponsible. She has no sense of personal boundaries. The girl tried to kiss me... She gropes Nick but now I just think that's funny. But you see? And I don't think she has any regard for anyone but herself. Tory's kind of like that too, but not as bad.

Target didn't want to hire me. Justin says its because of the one guy who interviewed me, but I think it's probably more than that. Which is ok. I have to keep telling myself to keep going. It shouldn't have hurt as much as it did. But I think that's because I got my hopes up for this. Should never have done that. When you get your hopes up, they get shot down. Keep your head down, and you're fine.

So I'm here at his apartment again, fixing up a resume. *sigh* The only good point is that Amy from Goodwill said she'll be a reference, and she can offset the sour note that job ended on. Which is so fucked up in the first place. I worked there almost a year and a half, doesn't that count for anything? I work hard, I'm honest, I bend over backwards for my employers. It's not fair that I get shuffled to the side.

I'm fighting chronic shyness, crippling fear and nerves, and extreme self consciousness. But you can't tell. All you get is the impression that I'm quiet and introverted. You have no idea how far down the scale I really am. Which is a really great success, wonderful progress and improvement... but it's not enough. Not yet. I must become enough of an actress to fool people into thinking I'm as outgoing as my sister. Lie enough to make people believe I'm confident in the face of their powerful intimidation.

If it wasn't a job interview I would be fine. Meeting people informally is easy. I know who I am and where I stand; I'm confident in my own strength. But when it comes to something important like this... I am fully aware that I have no power. This decision rests entirely in the opinion of someone who can turn me away at the slightest inclination. I know this. It gets in behind my defenses and reminds me how small I am in the world. No one of consequence, nothing special, nothing important. Unskilled, antisocial, dross of society...

See? It's easy to hear. But I've said it before, tragedy is easy. My mind is trained to pull its beauty from the dark. Positive things, light, they just don't come to me the way sadness and anger do. I'm not very good at putting anything in a positive light, not even myself.

So please don't get angry with me when this takes longer than it should. I'm asking for a little patience; this is difficult for me. I don't need you to hold my hand, but a little light my way couldn't hurt. It may not look like it, but I'm tying my psyche in knots to make this sound right. I'm wringing every drop of inspiration I can from my brain.

No small feat, and I had no idea he was working so hard on it, or that they got good enough for any true recognition. So, I'm impressed.

The other day I had a reunion day, and it wierded me out. It started after my job interview at Target (Don't ask, nothing's come of it) and I was ridiculously stressed, as is my wont. So I went to Spoons for some comfort food, soup. Afterwards I was walking back to the car, and I ran into Charity! I'm so glad I keep running into her. She's a fae spirit if ever I met one. She was avoiding some school work, so we had coffee (tea) and talked for a good hour or so. Poor thing, I love her dearly, but she's so flighty. Seperated from her husband too. He's strange though, so I saw it coming.

Much later in the day I went back to Old Town with my mother; we were going to have dinner at Beau Jo's pizza. Megan calls me up and asks if I'd eaten yet, and I invite her to come with us. Chat until about 10, and mom goes back home and leaves me in Old Town with Megan. She and I went to Old Chicago because she needed something to drink. She had her first sex on the beach, which made me laugh. Couldn't even finish two though. X3

Ah Megan... I can't understand her casual attitude toward sex. I'm sorry if I offend anyone with this, but that's never been my experience, and I don't think it should be. Forgive me if I sound old fashioned, but it's too personal to just make a habit out of. Isn't that kind of connection, deep and chained to the heart and soul? To constantly rip out parts of your heat and give to just anyone... That's what it really is. And I fail at truly describing it. *sigh* The point is, I don't like the idea of just sleeping around; it's just... wrong.

Let's see what else... The house is gripped with Ghostbuster fever. ^^ From the movies to the game... today my darling came home with a wood backed poster. I can't argue. I like it. I'd been bothering him to see the old movies for a while, so it was awesome to see them again. They're definitely on my top movie list of all time. The humor is timeless, even if the special effects aren't. And, excitement of all excitements, there's a third movie in the making!! Ah that's right, he also bought the entire animated series.

So I'm writing this, Daniel's playing Fable II, another good game. He got two others today, but this is the only one that interests me at the moment. When I play the others, I'll write more about them. 

Another day then."

"event","Another fucking year... The incubus sighed and turned the key to his apartment. Same shitty apartment, same fucking city... Same fucking scene. Throw his shoes at the scuffed wall by the door. Pull a bottle from the fridge. Collapse on the couch with his pants undone and jerk off to another memory like a pathetic human. Of course, it was his birthday. Maybe he could go buy a hooker...

Fuck.

The fridge was empty; that wasn't right. He could have sworn he'd gone to the store... yeah. He had to have, last week. The guy at the counter had stared at the rows of alcohol and asked where the party was. He just laughed when Leon said it was all for him. He couldn't have drunk it all in just a week...

Wait.

The window was open, and he knew that it had been closed when he left. Leonovitch swore fluently as he went over to it. The smell was still there... His neighbor directly above him had often stopped by to ask for a cup of sugar or things like that. But the drug addicted whore always went to his window via the fire escape instead of using the door. He often suspected her of taking things from time to time. But this... He clambered out the window and made his way up the stairs, visions of murder dancing in his head. If she drunk all that and died he'd be so sorry.

Sorry he didn't get to her first.

Well what do you know, her window was open. Supressing a growl and demonic gleam in his eye he clambered through. The living room was trashed; needles lay atop a mirror on the table by the chair. The carpet was stained with he didn't want to know what, and the smell from the kitchen implied that the garbage hadn't been taken out all week. There was a soft noise coming from the bedroom, and it made the demon pause before opening the door. When he did, his breath was taken away.

Usually, his neighbor looked like a cheap whore after a sorority party. Her dirty blonde hair hung in matted tangles and she smelled like she'd never washed the vomit off. He never saw her outside of the sweatpants and big button up shirts that hung off a shoulder. But for some reason here she was, hair washed gold and shaped into curls framing a pretty, made up face. And with nothing but her undergarments her thin body, while too thin from drugs and lack of diet, was still reminiscent of a former beauty.

Despite this change, what shocked him wasn't the sight of her, nor was it the fact that she was bound on her bed and seemed somewhat drugged. It was the creature reclined casually next to her, staring at him with a smile on her face while her fingers played underneath the woman's underwear.

""I wondered when you'd show up for your party, my love."" She purred, and it sent shivers up his spine. As he came closer she pulled her hand back and offered her fingers to the woman, who took them greedily into her mouth. ""I got you a present for your birthday. I hope you didn't think I'd forget.""

He stared from the angel of death to the whore on the bed. Slowly, like the setting of the sun, a dark smile creeped over his lips. He closed his eyes and breathed in, smelling her and the monster nect to her. ""Care to join me?""

""I would love to."" The angel held out a hand to him, and he took it and bent to kiss the woman's lips, then her neck. She moaned think and sweet, and it made him want to shove the barrel of a gun in that pretty mouth.

Raeshiel must have known what he was thinking, she caught his eye and motioned toward the closet. He climbed over their prey and found inside a collection of guns. Leon almost cried. He selected a nice handgun and turned to find Rae pulling skin from the woman's chest, licking at the exposed flesh with her exquisite tongue.

He almost staggered it made him hard so fast. He pushed Rae aside and straddled the woman, taking her hair in a fist and kissing her hard enough to bruise. She took the gun into her mouth even more eagerly than she'd taken the taste of herself on Raeshiel's fingertips, sucking like it was ecstasy.

The incubus ripped her panties off and thrust three fingers inside of her. She bucked and moaned throught the steel, and with a sneer he pulled the trigger. Blood splattered all over his clothes, onto his face. A soft chuckle made him turn to find Rae licking blood delicately from her hand. With the same smile he pointed the gun at her.

""Your turn.""

She smiled like a panther. ""Come and get it.""

Their kiss was like a war, each seeking dominance over the other, neither really gaining the upper hand. She bit his lip and blood welled between them, adding a metallic taste. Claws shredded his clothing and he pulled away from the kiss to tear hers off. He pushed his angel onto the bed rough enough to make it shift on the floor, throwing her body atop the corpse. He was on top of her in an instant, thrusting into her body before she had time to leave. 

She was wet and hot and everything he remembered from the old days. He fucked her like he meant to kill her, and when her teeth found his neck it was all he could do to keep from melting into her arms and losing himself in the blood and darkness that was his sweet angel of death.  

But he couldn't keep so strong forever, and she fought her way above him, bruising his hips with her clawed grip and making him moan for her like the whore lying dead next to them. Slick with sweat and blood covering their bodies, he cried out her name when he came so hard he thought he was going to die.

Breathless, they lay together on blood covered sheets. Raeshe pushed the body over like a ragdoll, breaking the bedposts and toppling them over with it. She curled her pale frame around his and, licking the blood from his lips, whispered ""Happy Birthday, my darling."""

I can't calm your restless spirit, can I? For those brief moments your demon smile is bright and lifts my heart. Bubbles of happiness, fragile and quick, so full of color and then... quick as an indrawn breath its gone, leaving no trace it was there, save the memory of swirling color floating impossibly in the air like a dream. I promise you I'll find a way to bring you the peace you deserve. Until then... 

I can tell by the way you play. Like this morning. I like to close my eyes and listen to the sounds weave in, out, and around each other. They tell me what you feel, the music you weave with your finely shaped hands. I wish I could affect you more than I do. Then I could help you smile more. 

I guess I'm not the only one who needs to smile more, huh Ketsu? 

We got a mattress today. After what has it been, a week? of sleeping on a blanket on the floor. ^^ It's a nice little futon mattress, not the best but its comfortable enough and it was only seventy dollars so who am I to complain?

Down to the wire. I'll make it. I hope you don't worry too much about me. I'll make it. I always do. Promise. The phone thing... that could be problematic at worst. I'll get by. It's only until I get a job, right?

"event","I have a DS, and I am absolutely hooked on Pokemon Diamond... 

DON'T JUDGE ME!!!!! *laughter*

I haven't played this game in such a long time. So I think that's why I can pick this one up and be all ""hey, this is actually kind of fun""... I'm still not a big fan of all the new stupid pokemon. I loved the original, you can't really improve on that enough to justify all the idiotic, lazy designs Nintendo came up with.

Other news... Life is still boring. I don't have a job, still trying... sick of trying. But I have to keep on it. I want to be able to be a support for the love of my life. I hate being a mooch. Absofuckinglutely hate it. If there's one thing I always strive to be, its self-sufficient. If I can't carry my own weight, what good am I?

Still... Everyone tells me I should enjoy it while I can. I really can't argue. It's more time than I've had with my dearest than ever. At least I have a little money saved. It's not going to last me another month, but I've been able to keep my head above water, so to speak. I've tried not to be a problem to Justin or Dan. I hope I'm not imposing. If I am, I don't know what I'll do. Stay at home with my mom I guess.

But I love being here. A safe place, somewhere to really rest... So now its my home. Don't tell Justin though. ^^ I'm not supposed to think that way. But it's true; home is where your heart is, and mine is here. Everything is... in place. It all fits, and I'm safe. I'll protect that with every fibre is my body. 

Not that I'll need to. This isn't like it used to be. I don't have bad friends' girlfriends barging in, no ridiculous drama bringing angry people into my place. No one breaks the sanctity of my haven. I don't take it very well, to say the least. If I don't feel safe... I have no remorse hurting anyone.

I hope I don't slip with you... I've come so close sometimes to hurting you. And you provoke me! Are you trying to make me break you? It takes all the self-control I've ever learned to stop myself from breaking bones when you provoke me like that. I don't like being shamed or belittled... I just want love. So cliche, but its as close to the truth as mere words can get.

You want me to be the destroyer that I was? You'll lose everything about me that you love, my darling. I worked so hard to bind and hide away that part of me. In the deepest recesses of my heart I am dark and murderous... Don't roll your eyes, I wish you would understand. I don't want attention, just the opposite; I'm just telling the truth. In my little journal where the only people who read this already know who and what I am and can be. *waves to everyone*

Completely different, how come no one likes Dir en grey but me!? Well, out of the friends I am capable of seeing on any given day. And for the last time, it is not screaming banshee sex and Kyo does not sound like a pterodactyl... well ok, maybe he can sound somewhat animalistic... Not the point. I'm beating a dead horse. This subject comes up a lot in here, doesn't it? ^^

Lately I've been editing my mother's papers for her classes. She's working on her degree, as I think I've said, and I'll be glad when its over. I'm almost sick of it all. Mother is very appreciative, and it's not that much of a problem, but I'm tired of all the grammar and spelling and format and... ugh. I know that mom wouldn't have a chance at this if I wasn't helping, but I'm beginning to resent it. I'm trying not to, but oh its hard. It takes three drafts for her to get the same fixes I gave her in the first draft. Can anyone really be that dumb? It's just so... frustrating sometimes.

Speaking of... Damn cats decided to use my room as a litter box. I don't know why; it could be because mom took away one of the boxes, it could be because she had just cleaned the one out and made it smell different. Either way my bed reeks of cat pee and they pooped on my favorite scarf. Of course. Amusingly enough, as I was cleaning up some of the mess, Gabriel just waltzes in right there and almost goes right on my floor. I yelled at him and almost kicked him up the stairs. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my cats more than anythng. They're family. But oh sometimes...

They were all being nice to me this morning. Snuggling and purring... I'm not fooled guys. Not even a little bit. ^^

So my darling brother Nick really is opening for Slayer and Marilyn Manson. Mansen? No no, Manson. Aynway, I'm kinda proud. Kinda annoyed that he's been ignoring his family to do it. You have two adorable sons, you need to be there for them; they need a father, not a rock star. But I'm still proud of you, bro. You're still the kind of sweet, nice guy that the world needs more of. Just... grow a backbone. Please. ^^

Oh hey, Leon you'll be proud of me! I cooked! ^^ My meatball sandwiches are kick ass! And I basically made them from scratch too. They're awesome. So there, I tried something different. Which reminds me, WRITE MORE IN YOUR LJ!!! I CAN'T KNOW WHATS GOING ON IF YOU DON'T TELL ME. ^^ Luff and stuff. 

Woah, its almost two in the morning... I need to stop... yeah...

More later. Hope something comes up in the job area. I'll keep you posted.

Oh, PS... Bria, I'm watching you... O.o *smile*"

*cough* In other news... I twisted my ankle falling down the stairs a few days ago. Minding my own business, carefree, safe in my own house... when all of a sudden a wild animal comes careening down the stairs, tripping me up and causing me to fall the rest of the way. It's not as bad as it could be, Dan's was worse, but it still hurts. ^^

My dearest boyfriend bought me a DS, I am so happy! ^^ *huge grin* So besides the happy daggers bouncing and giggling, I have the ""game"" My Japanese Coach. So I can really get cracking on my Japanese lessons. I've got Dan and Justin working on it too. It's fun. That and when the new Kingdom Hearts game comes out on the DS I am so getting it.

I miss my friends though... I haven't seen my Turks in such a long time... I know they changed their name but to me we will always be the Turks. At least... if I'm still in it. I know I haven't been around a lot... It's because I don't feel part of the group because I can't work on costumes with no money. So while everyone is talking shop I have to just sit back and wish I could do it too.

So mostly I spend my days over at Justins, when I'm not job hunting. I can use his computer, so that's why I've been writing more often. That and I actually get to play the video games here. Justin doesn't mind watching me play, which is a surprise to me. It used to be that I either watched Superior play, or he would go do something else when I wanted to try. He would never stick around... it made me sad.

As I am writing this Dan is working on his Japanese lesson and Justin is playing his shiny new Red Faction Geurrilla. It's a fantastic game where almost everything is destructible; the physics engine is superb. You can collapse towers onto nearby buildings to destroy them in turn.Take out supports and the whole thing falls down. Just make sure its not going to fall on you! ^^ Which happened a few times but it was fun as hell.

But at least they gave him a perscription for anti-biotics, just in case it was mono or something. Still... I hate doctors. 

He's back at work today; he was so miffed about losing the hours at work yesterday, when I made him stay home to recover. So worried about money... He's like that though. I guess we balance each other out. He's obsessively neat and clean, organized, his house is black and white. I'm much more laid back, and I like color. He calls my room cluttered, I think its cozy. ^^ Ah well. Love him dearly, nonetheless.

I played two game demos today, one for Xmen Origins, and one for Infamous. Now Niku already told me how awesome Wolverine is, but I just had to see for myself and Justin has the demo on the PS3 so... ^^ It is so much fun. And probably the bloodiest game I have yet to see. Beautifully done though. The environments are stunning, and all the blood, all the blood... Oops, now I'm hungry. ^^ 

Infamous is like GTA meets Assassin's Creed meets Force Unleashed. XD Play it, you'll know what I mean. I don't like the fact that you gravitate toward ledges and things, it makes jumping on specific places a bit more difficult. But I probably won't complain when jumping long distances. The demo lets you get a little taste of both the good powers and the evil powers. My favorite thing so far? Gliding on railroad tracks like a train! But apparently you can't go into water. I guess you get overcharged or something because it hurts you.

Still looking for a job. This is ridiculous... I prefer paper applications over all this online stuff. I really do. Because it gives me more of a chance to present myself, you know? Ask for hiring managers, show up all nice looking, its more personal than do the application online and we'll get back to you. Oh well... Back to the grindstone."

I cycled through my web comics, a ritual that began four years ago with 8-bit theater, I checked my e-mail... This is the last thing I do on the computer. 

Update, update... You know I've had this journal for years? Someday when I have nothing to do and more motivation than I have today, maybe I'll read through some of them. I have a feeling it'll just go in cycles, but who knows, you know? I forget a lot of thing; maybe I'll unearth some rotten little core in a dusty, cobwebbed corner of my soul I haven't rummaged through in years. Sounds fun. ^^

I want a new game system, but its all wishful thinking. ^^ I've never had the money to spend on something like that. But oh, to be able to play Gears of War whenever I wanted. Lost Odyssey, Lair, FEAR, Metal Gear Solid 4, Oblivion... I'm an eclectic gamer. Speaking of, Dan got an N64 and I've been playing Conker's Bad Fur Day... There is no game like this one. It's ridiculously entertaining. That and all three of us have been playing Gauntlet Legends. ^^ Now that's nostalgia. 

Nick and Tory went to Utah this past weekend. She to see her girlfriend, he to visit with XDCDX. And I am so bitterly jealous. I don't want to be, but it eats at me. He has so many friends now... No that's not it. I think it bothers me because I'm not so important anymore. Because he doesn't need me anymore. We're not even together anymore, how can I expect to be the center of his world? Come on Rae, grow up.

He's crueler to me now than he's ever been. No, maybe that's wrong. He's just cold, keeping me at a distance. And I can't stand not being wanted. I really am pathetic cometimes... Wow, self discovery is a bitch. 

No, not discovery. I knew this. Haven't I always told everyone I'm not a nice person? Oh dear... You don't think I could have thought I was lying do you? Because... I wasn't. Sorry dear, you're not as kind as you have everyone believe. You're twisted and depraved; your dessicated soul is crouched in the shadows of a pretty shell, but that's all it is. A shell.

I wonder how long he'll stay. When he sees behind your smile a cruel heart with no love for anyone, what will he think? Will he believe you when you tell him he's different? Aren't you a little old to believe that kind of thing works in the real world?

Maybe he will. We're so happy together.

Only because you give him what he wants. When you stop being his dream girl he'll drop you like last week's garbage.

But I'm not pretending to be anything I'm not. I've shown him nothing but the real me.

Shh... I know you don't mean to. You never mean to. But you have to keep up the facade, so they don't put you down. And you wear the mask so well, you pretty little viper, you fool even yourself. That's the key, isn't it? If you can convince yourself, you can convince anyone. That's how you were such a good thief, remember?

And if he reads this, he'll think you're immature at best, crazy at worst. You don't want him to read this... and part of you does. So he can see how you think. And not because he might accept you. You want him to push you away, don't you? So you can cry and say to me, see? I am a monster.

Poor little vampire, all alone.
By her own hand, she has no home.
She keeps her broken heart entombed,
So she can say she always knew.

Selfish girl, with petty thoughts
Watching as her own soul rots.
Pathetic girl, so weak at heart
Rips her body, rends it apart.

And as she dies, she cries out
Why am I always left out.
Stupid creature, kills herself.
Can't blame any but herself.

Yet she tries.



You know what the greatest part of this is? I'm not even bipolar."

"event","She was so beautiful on their wedding day. Her hair like russet gold cascaded around her face, framing eyes green as the emerald hills of Ireland, their home. Her mother and grandmother had worked countless hours making her dress, their gift for this the happiest day of her life. And he had been so proud, watching this sylph walking toward him, eyes so full of hope and happiness. Her smile pausing only long enough to say I do...

And the way the sun caught her face in the morning, when he woke early to stoke the fires by the anvil. As she slept it was as if Heaven was brushing gentle fingers of dawn across her cheek. He had fallen for this angel passing through her village, when his warrior's heart still roamed in search for adventure and gold. She had stolen it and given hers in return, and he could never have been happier.

But when she was awake... there was no greater glory. He could barely work the hammer when she came from the house to see to the garden by their home. No sweeter smile could be found anywhere in such a gentle face. And the way her eyes sparkled... So in love...

Then the fear in those eyes when one night the demons he hunted for years had come to his peaceable house. He came home and found them outside, and in fear and rage he drew the sword he never left without. Weak monsters, but after so long it was terrifying. What of his wife? He rushed inside.

They had been in the house. The furniture they had saved up for, the beautiful table she had so loved, riven and blackened with demon claws. His heart pounded. Everything broken, but where was his beloved? So many tales of innocents ripped into pieces, he feared to see her dead around every turn.

She was crying in the corner, trembling and terrified. Safe! Oh thank the gods...She looked up at his approach, and fear turned to relief as she reached a hand out to him. He ran to embrace her, stopped as his arms closed around her. His blood froze colder than the winter's icy snow.

He looked down at the love of his life, and with a cry sprang back. Her eyes, sparkling green eyes, stared at him in a mixture of shock and fear. He could only stare back, through those windows into a soul he thought he knew. She begged him to tell her what was wrong. Tears, when he wouldn't reply. He couldn't... and turned his face away. She rushed to his side, but with a cold hand he thrust her away. She fell to the ground with an anguished cry. 

So beautiful, even then! Her sweet tears, glittering in candlelight... but through a monster's eyes. And a demon's crest upon her pale, perfect brow. Such deceit! Such lies! His beautiful, perfect wife. His happiness, his reason for life... oh what a cruel irony for such a demon hunter he had been.

His heart turned to stone, he drew his sword. He had loved her, pledged his life to... a monster. It was over in a moment. She didn't scream; just those eyes, begging for mercy, begging to understand, begging for love... But demons can't love.

So he told me, in slurs between long drinks. The last thing he said, actually. Demon's can't love. I beg to differ, and his life ended because I couldn't bear to think of what happened to her.

What must have gone through her mind, not knowing why her husband was staring at her with such hatred? She never knew what she was, many don't and never do. Little girl with the heart of demon. Creatures escaped from hell seeking refuge on earth, forgetting everything to try and live. They don't know... And so the man she loved plunged a sword through her body even as she pleaded to know why."

Since when is that any different from other days?

I take that back, it's untrue. I was somewhat happy yesterday, dreaming of getting a slave collar and serial tag for my beloved little Leon. Wyredslaves has some of the most beautiful work I have ever seen. And not just collars, but anklets and cuffs too. *sigh* Unfulfilled fantasies... I'm a hopeless twisted romantic and I don't care.

Bored. Bored and tired. Bored and tired and failing on the social front. I'm withdrawing from everyone and I didn't even notice. <i>That's</i> how sneaky I am. I miss my old friends. Leon and Schu and Farfie and everyone from Schuld un Sunde... I miss you all so much. I used to be able to lurk for days and have fun with you all. Now I won't go back until I can be on Gaia regularly. I'm missing a lot, and for that I'm sorry. I want to return!!! But I bet most of you aren't there any more.

Real... oh you mean friends I can see and touch on a regular basis? Yeah... that's... that's not going so well either. I'm uncomfortable around all of them. At some point I was pressed back into the on-the-edge outsider role again. I just have to get used to it. It's where I started, no reason not to be comfortable with it again. Just sad I guess.

And you, my dear Superior... You don't even see it. Don't complain anymore about being alone. You're not. Between the Turks, the Paopu Guardians (How do you spell Paopu?), and XDCDX... You don't need me anymore. Don't you understand? Look at you. Strong on your own feet, confident and proud. I healed the breaks, helped you stand... I'm just a crutch now. I gave you everything, don't waste it. Go. Start walking. Run. Leap. You are as free now as you ever were. Don't fall back on your knees. Don't fall back to me. You've moved beyond it. You're so much stronger than me. What a wonder is man..."

Not so great when its cold and windy, weren't supposed to be that far into the mountains anyway, you're only just recovering from food poisoning, it's getting dark, and you're lost. Oh yeah, you heard me. Lost. Now I don't mean the oh no we're spending the night in the wilderness so far away from civilization kind of lost. That would have been an adventure. Instead it was the irritating we're at the wrong lake out of three and this campground looks like all the others oh well we have to hike up the road to the right one kind of lost.

I was sorely tempted to stage ""accidents""... But one of the few I actually care about was there with me. If something happened to the other two he would know exactly who made them fall. Ah well... Maybe now you realize that I'm not the kind person you believe me to be. That gently as a baby's sigh I can slip into the madness that demands blood. That is the true core of my being. When you strip away all the layers of me... that is what I come down to.

Tug of war, back and forth... Let me know what screaming's for. If you die before I wake, then you won't care whose life I take. I love you, I hate you, my conscience, my love. Hold me back, keep me sane, don't let me go that mad again. Let me out, set me free, I'll show you how bad I can be...

"event","She didn't ask for worship. Angels never do. Designed and built as servants, they were never given that human trait of ambition. Only after years on earth did any of them ever learn it. And those were punished, just like Lucifer.

Of course, this angel was already damned, so there was nothing to lose. And the scent of blood pouring out in her name, well there was nothing like it in all the world. An extra flavor, beyond the senses but tangible nonetheless, made her job all the sweeter. As the renegade angel of death, what else was there?

What else but this... A whispered prayer that echoed in the back of her mind with a familiar cadence. A power much stronger than gods or men catching her attention and begging her to find its source with all the subtlety of a tidal wave.

It only took a moment to find, and she had to smile in spite of herself. The girl was pretty, and looked a little like her. The mediterranean features, long dark hair... And a gun pointing at her. A slower smile revealed gleaming fangs.

""What a tribute, my beloved. You haven't quite lost your touch."" She purred. She reached out and traced a claw down across the fine scars running on her supplicant's flesh. Each and every one a testimony to his adoration. A reminder of all the reasons the angel of death felt love for one creature in all the world.

All that she wanted to do... but this was a game of chess after all. His lithe body tense before her was inviting, but she couldn't give in to it. Not yet anyway. Not to that perfect disharmony ringing in the air between them, or the smell of blood and smoke.

Not your eyes, not your lips, not your words, not your kiss...

Well done.

Tease me like you used to. Beg and plead, writhe and bleed for me. I miss our games of Russian Roulette. I want you to tremble with fear and pain and obsession and love... Come back to me, dirty creature, little whore. On your knees, knife in your hand. Barrel of a gun. Remember how it tasted? 

Take your life, or I will take it for you.

You forgot your place, beloved little one. Too long since you whispered my name with hot ferocity. Too long since you fucked yourself with no one to hate but you. Where are the scars, where are the marks? Do you still kill in my name? Am I still the reason you can't stop your fingers from reaching into your pants? 

I want to kill you for your insolence, fuck you for your pride. Of all the angels... you chose the one who would murder you as soon as look at you. The only thing that stops me are those brown eyes so full of adoration... that remind me of the tender words and soft cries. 

You're the only one who divides me in half like this. The only one who turns soft kisses into poison and wounds into caresses. So talented, so far, and so very far away.

It doesn't last. It stops. It will. 
Hush, my love. Don't scream, be strong.

"event","In general terms, she never understood mankind's preoccupation with sex. Disgusting bodies rutting on the ground covered in sweat, saliva, and the collective mixture of man and woman. Base, animal, and unnecessary. Unless creating more of each other is their goal. Have children then see in their sons and daughters the face of a one time love now turned to hate staring back at them. I love you sweetie, but sometimes I want to kill you. You look like your father, you smile like your mother. I hate you in secret... And the story goes on and the circle spins again. 

And interlaced with them are those creatures some called demons who drive humans to use this...hobby, desire, whatever they call it... for what they call sin. Succubus, incubus, fiends and fallen angels, the terms are meaningless. Just more words that give nothing to the actual form. <i>We all do what we were designed to do from the very beginning. We have little choice...</i>

She can sense the one she's looking for. Never would she forget that scent, the only one that still recalls so clearly even now. Once it was the acrid smell of gunfire and cigarette smoke, drifting smooth and languorous as his personality. Sometimes if she closed her eyes the angel could still imagine it on her clothes...

<i>The barrel pressed against her head and an arm holding hers to breaking point behind her back... smoking gun and the taste of metal and blood... mouths pressed hungrily together... light on a blade...cracking collarbones... lacerated backs...tongue in flesh never meant to be penetrated... rending skin to take the heart... sweet kisses and rough touches...cry out together in the end...harmony of blood and tears in a haven of hell.</i>

But that was long ago. It's twisted now, mixed with too much flesh and grime. Stronger now as she navigates dim, dirty hallways strewn with bodies in degenerating states of disarray. Whatever the original intent, they lie now like carcasses bloated on sex and drugs and alcohol. Discarded dolls covered in filth. Somewhere in this tired dollhouse of refuse he is here.<i>What a legacy, my dear incubus... and I thought I was the fallen one.</i> 

Of course. In the furthest reaches, surrounded by so many bodies. Men and women alike, she remembered he had no qualms for gender, as long as they suited his tastes enough. Probably in the center of a writhing mass only a few hours ago, he lies half dressed with a cigarette nub between fingers a pianist would die for. Unkempt, even for a demon, it would break her heart to see him like this if she was capable of such sentiment.

""Timur Leonovitch Aleksander Sokolov... you should be ashamed."" Only a whisper, but he hears it. She knows he hears every carefully pronounced name. The incubus looks up and she can see his eyes widen in the gloom. Is that fear, or shame? Surprise at the very least; Pity she couldn't read him as well as she read humans. The angel who once was death circled closer, uncaring of the human limbs beneath her feet.

""You didn't expect me to come back, did you? Or at least... not now. Not to see you in this filth."" She smirked, a vampire's smile. ""You used to be such an artist... why did you cast away your muse? Why forsake your angel?""

""Raeshiel..."" He was standing, but she was already there. Her clawed hands were at his throat, holding his lithe little body pinned against the wall above the ground. Not tight enough to render him unconscious, no. There were words that needed saying. And not here.

With a hiss she threw the incubus through the wall. He recovered amazingly fast, but nothing of his former glory moved his limbs, and it was nothing to slip past the bullets from the gun he fired. It almost made her smile. The sound of his Russian MP-412 was a fond memory, after all.

""Of all the angels you chose, you had to have the one who could destroy you on a whim."" A few steps and a palm strike tossed him completely through the last remnants of the building and into the street. The overcast sky concealed his fall from the face of a waning moon. He picked himself up painfully, watching the angel step from the gap in the walls and spread dark, blood covered wings to the air.

""You left."" He spat blood and wiped his mouth with a dirty sleeve. The wounds healed quickly, his stagger was only for show. <i>Come now, my love. You can do better than that.</i>

""You knew where I'd gone. You always know where I am."" One wing flicked and feathers shot like arrows to stab through his body and the concrete wall behind him. Leon howled, but he knew better than to push against those feathers. She hated to use them, but he always made it so necessary. He pushed her to her limits. She had loved that about him.

""You're pathetic, Timur. Pining away in grotesque squalor for something you think you can't have? Abandon me for cheap imitations and sorry substitutes? Well... I wish you hadn't forgotten me."" She reached out and ran a clawed fingernail down his cheek before slapping him hard enough to rattle teeth. She kissed him hard, seeking out the blood welling in his mouth. A possessive kiss, giving him nothing to call his own.

Her teeth found his neck, but he would get no tenderness from the scorned angel of death. She tore into his throat, peeling flesh back down to his chest and ripping it free. Fingers found tendons and snaked between them to rake nails across bare bone. 

""So you'll remember why none of your toys are worth it..."" She smiled licked the rivulets of blood from his chest. He convulsed against the steel strong feathers keeping him pinned, unable to make a sound through his bloody and ruined vocal cords. Not until she plunged her hand into his chest and wrapped her fingers around his beating heart.

Then he howled like the damned in the lowest pits of hell, a sound that began high beyond all mortal hearing then fell in gasps and sobs to moans and whimpers. Echoes of the screams reverberated through the city, and men crossed themselves and children hid from the monsters only they still know exist.

Red eyes gleamed a moment, and she slowly let go of his heart, pounding terror and lust against her grasp. With a sigh, Raeshiel pulled his body from dissolving feathers and cast it aside. He bounced once against the pavement. This time, he didn't rise.

She watched him a moment, licking the blood from her fingers. His heart still beat blood through his broken body. It would heal, and maybe his body wouldn't even show a scar. His spirit... that was up to him. And if he didn't understand what she was giving him, then the next time would be the last he saw her.

She hoped that wouldn't be the case.

""Come find me, Leon. Wake the monster you used to be, and come play with me. I'm still waiting.""

For the chains you put on my heart and soul, for the cage you put me in and made me believe was freedom. You lied the day you said you loved me. I don't forgive. 

For believing you could keep me in my place, keeping me below you. For abandoning me the day I needed you the most. You lied when you gave me your friendship. I will not forgive.

Disconnected... I feel disconnected. From everyone, sometimes even from myself. I feel like I'm just playing in a world that I'm not really a part of. There's everyone on earth living their lives... and I'm just a part of the world, not humanity. Like there's a seperate category of existence...

Older vampires talk about this. I didn't get it. I think I might now. We're not sad, we're not happy... we just are. I can see myself objectively, I can see my entire life as coldly as if I were studying a thing in a cage. I don't have to see through my emotions, as sterile as logic it doesn't make a difference. But I still have my sense of self. As if my personality was under glass, to hold forever.

They say eternity will do that. A vampire will look at the world and realize that things may change a little; humanity ebbs and flows like a sea of pulsing bodies but some of us will always be here. And some things don't change. Humans are just as cruel and just as weak as they ever were. Nothing changes the petty drama of everyday struggle. Look at the children playing in the park. Already the power struggle begins with the one kicking sand in the face of the ostracized. Aren't you adorable?

Besides hunters, the number one cause of death among vampires must be despair. No one wants to live forever; not really. It's just like watching reruns of all your favorite shows and all the ones you hate and realizing that your preference had nothing to do with anything, they're all the same. Just different names and faces. No matter what there will always be painted on dreams of happy endings just like the fairytales no one really believes. And like always the children grow up and become machines and murderers."

"event","I know its taken me a while, but I didn't want to write anything else before I got to post all about this. And I didn't want to post without being able to put up the pictures. So this morning I finally got the pictures uploaded. All of them... O.O;

So without further ado, lets begin!

It was a wonderful ride up on Friday, crammed in the back of Naru's truck with Ash. ^^ Amusingly enough I'm not being sarcastic. I really did enjoy myself. Naru's Wind Shuriken was strapped down in the back... I know that if anyone readin this has seen any pictures from NDK last year or the pics from Wasabi this year, you will all find at least ten pictures of Naru-chan. We can't go ten steps without anyone asking him for a picture. He loves the attention.

But I digress. We get there, Naru in his costume, Tory as Sakura, Ash the purple and black kitsune, and my dark kitten costume. Registration was a weird method of texting your information and waiting for them to call your name. It's a pain to text all that... but I think it probably did make things go a lot faster. Except I sat for three hours waiting for them to get the card reader stuff all fixed up. The ATM in the hotel had no money left in it that day. Fortunately the dealer's room was closed or I would have been very sad. One good thing about sitting next to the registration desk was that <i>everyone has to come through there</i> so I had it easy hunting for all the cosplayers to get pictures of. And I got lots. Don't worry, I'll get to them.

Naru and Tory abandoned me for Sasuke and the rest of their Narutard group. It's okkei, really. I could wander around on my own and talk to people and make short term friends. It was great! I even had a few people ask to take my picture. *blush* It wasn't that great... I was waiting for my friends later, and someone just randomly comes up and talks to me. He said I looked sad. ^^ I don't know maybe I did. But we talked for hours after that. Until I had to go with Naru and group to Sasuke's.

We stayed the night at Sasuke's house, she lives near there. It was there we discovered that we had forgotten both of my wigs at Ash's house. *cry* So I couldn't do my Farfie or my Yuki cosplay. Well in the morning we decided that since Tory wasn't going to use her orange wig until Sunday I could use it and we could try Farfie anyway. His hair is red in the manga right? Heh... And may I just say this? Binding hurts. Lots. But with rolls and rolls and rolls of gauze I think I did a really good Farfie outside of the hair. I didn't have the shirt but I had the gauze all the way down the torso. And my scars were the best.

We get to the convention, and I get ditched. So I hung around with more random people. Eventually it hurt too much to be worth my half-assed attempt at Farfie. So Ash helped me undo the bindings and redo them enough to cover necessities. Naru was at a hockey game so he had our stuff in the back of the truck. No bra for Rae. -_-;; But thank you Ash it still worked. Then I pulled out the tail after I got some better ears and it turned into another catgirl. I met another Farfie cosplayer after that. Actually I knew her from the Life of the Party in Old Town. I had done a better job with the scars and the pants and the bondage straps and the gauze... but she had a wig and contacts and she had made his extendo-sword... even though it didn't really extend... oh well. 

I spent waaaaay too much money. But I couldn't help it, they had Weiss art books! And Final Fantasy VII shounen ai doujinshi... and phone charms and pencil boards and keychains and bags and plushies and shirts and wallscrolls and manga and dvds... Heaven!!!!!! 

I bought a white lace parasol from one of the people who had rented a table outside of the dealers room. It'll come in handy for a future cosplay as Chidori from Persona 3. And two weiss art books... and cat ears... and three phone charms (two were fruba sets and one is from Juvenile Orion so I actually have five)... I bought so many Fate/Stay Night figures I have all six with four doubles. Then I bought a Caren Hortensia figure from Fate/Hollow Ataraxia just because she is that pretty. I lived on nothing but Ramune and Pocky and a few slices of pizza the entire weekend. Woo! Ash bought a wooden Tetsusaiga and Tory got a wooden Gunblade for her future Leon cosplay. ^^  I bought an ergo proxy bag just so I could fit our stuff in it.

We met a couple of military guys, one who was <i>this</i> close to looking just like young Revolver Ocelot. I told him so and he said he was going to but he didn't have the markings for Ocelot's rank right. Talk about attention to detail. All three of them were that dedicated and I loved it. Too bad I never got any of their names... -_- I'm so bad at that. I stole Ash's Tetsusaiga and walked around with that. I looked like some original character from InuYasha... I look cooler than him anyway. XD

Ash and I went with another friend we had made to their hotel room and we watched Devilman to kill time before eleven, when I wanted to watch Hentai Mystery Science Theater 3000. Oh my Gackt this movie was the dumbest, most laughable thing ever! We had so much fun making fun of it. But at eleven tory was moody and we had to go. I really wanted to go to that!

That night we stayed at Junpei's. He's still just like I remember. ^^ Why is it every convention I end up sleeping in the same bed as him? Naru, I think its you and tory's little plan or something. I blame you.

Sunday... back in my dark kitten costume. Now augmented with better ears and a leash. Got a few more pictures for that. Then we went home... and I slept. For a looong time. Until work in the morning. Blegh...

I said I would so now... Pictures!

I don't like Aeris, but this girl did a wonderful job! Those little ""metal"" bits on the coat even come off so she can wash it. If you're gonna cosplay, do it right. And she did!

Yay Candy Ninja!!! He's been at both conventions I've been to, and he has a special place in my heart already. Never got to talk to him, but I did ninja-glomp him!

Companion Cube!!!! Seriously, I was talking to a friend about Portal, how cool it would be to dress up as the Weighted Companion Cube. Not an hour later look who shows up! That made my entire weekend.

This girl I caught just in front of the registration table. She was so cute... actually reminded me of Haley. So I just had to get a picture... I wish I had gotten her name.

Deathnote. I liked these guys of all the Deathnote groups. Don't know why. I never got a shot of the shinigami being blue... but oh well.

Helena from Dead or Alive... She made an amazing costume too. I feel bad though my camera was being stupid and that's a painful pose to hold.

Tonberries are one of my favorite Final Fantasy creatures, so I was ecstatic to see this one. It's even got a hat for St. Patrick's Day!

Another very well done cosplay. He and the Vash discovered each other and hit it off really well, you could see them together throughout the weekend.

"event","Goodbye... goodbye... don't go. Don't... But I have to let you go don't I? I can't hold you from the person you love. 

How ironic.

I will keep the memories close to my heart. I will always remember being close to you... so close... I cried, you know. I cried underneath you, holding you tightly. Because I knew this would be our last night together. My last night to dream. My last night to hope.

My heart stops when I think about it. My soul is dead, and I have so little to live for. But you are my reason. I love you with all my heart, soul, mind. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. I don't ever want you to cry. I would take every pain to create a perfect haven for you... and her...

I will forever be here. I will forever love you. My heart is chained, wrapped around my throat before leashing me to you.

Let me die. Maybe if you forget about me you could be happier.

This is how I am. Looking back, its always been this way. I give my everything, the sacrifice of a fallen angel, to give you life. Take that life and walk away from me. Live your life, but I'm just the tool, the means, the small gear to get all the wheels turning. 

Ironic, that I mean to cosplay Rider from the anime Fate Stay Night. Servants aren't people, just tools. Weapons. So am I. I repaired your broken soul, healed your wounded heart, but in your life I am no more than the IV you pull from your arm in disgust after its job as your only lifeline is done.

Fly away, my angel most beautiful. Your eyes have burned my soul, and I will never be released from your light. Your hidden glory is too much for my blackened heart. I am not for you, no matter how long I might crawl through hell to find your heaven. You're too far above me to see the broken wings trying to open, hands trying to reach you. I cannot reach you and your bright angel.

The war is coming. I can smell it on the wind. At night when I walk it makes my skin tingle like electricity is running though it. Tension. Niku knows it, but he has been around me long enough to be there when I'm attacked. I'm used to it, watching my back every day for the closed-minded hunters who would take my life simply for the disease that runs in my blood.

But Joshua... my Joshua... I can't scream enough to reach you wherever you are. I can't cry enough tears to bring you back. When I saw... gods what I saw... crucified with railroad ties... It hurts to write, it hurts to remember. But I have to, so anyone who reads this will know.

Joshua died a long time ago. Or was supposed to have. He's lived here for six years on and off with his brother Jonathan. Yes, we share the same disease. They lived in my territory, under my protection. He was painfully shy, so much so that he didn't leave the house very often, during the day anyway. I think he was ashamed of being what he was. I never once knew him to hunt, and he was loathe to hurt anyone.

Why did you bastards, you sons of whores... why him!? Why? WHY!? I will find out who did it. I will destroy all of you, finding you inside your most horrifying nightmares and crucifying you just as you did to him. I will tear your hearts out and crush them, like you did to mine. I will make you feel all of our pain, thousandfold. You took an innocent life, no matter what you believe. I will have yours.

Why didn't he tell me? Only after his life is ended does his love find its way to me. Why didn't you say anything, Joshua? No... I know why. Because you are who you are... were... gods I can't keep doing this. This war will make me an empty shell. I can't keep losing everyone, it will destroy me. I will become nothing but a cold hunter.

I don't like what I am for one reason. Niku.

I am the synthetic goddess of unrequited love, unfurling dark wings covered in blood and chained to the bars of my cage. Come to me all you who are broken, and I will die for your hearts. I will be left in the rain and forgotten, but you will continure through the night and into the light of day."

"event","It seemed like a dream, a fragile breath of life on spider-web glass. Your eyes sparkling in the sunlight making me forget how much it burns... gods I can't get your smile out of my memory. So many days together, so many nights when I actually <i>rested</i>, knowing that you were there beside me, that in the morning I would wake up and you would be right there.

Shatter,
Reminder,
Say a prayer,
Before its all gone.
Frustrate,
Too late,
Don't wait,
Too far gone.

I ache to be in your arms again. Did you know I looked in the mirror this morning and my memory flashed to that time you came up behind me and held me, grinning at our reflection. But you're not there; the void behind me is cold and empty. 

You look past me now, and your back is turned. Your eyes are not for me; even if I could cross the distance I can't scale the walls around you. At night I listen to your heartbeat, holding you close because its all I can do, hold on to what I can and stop the tears. Heartbreak is two-fold; first the break, then the deep slices from the razor-sharp peices. The latter never fades.

What am I going to do... Sometimes I can feel the dark creeping in, the screaming in my heart I tried so hard to keep down. But it rises like fire and thunders in my ears, shattering my sanity. My heart is dying... I can feel it... Writhe in space, held down by gravity; I can't breathe through the thickness. Stop it... take it... take it... take it... I can't breathe. I can't... live... I can't escape... 

Blood. Cold. Dark. Unfurled wings black as murder. Nothing and empty inside. Roar in pain and rush into the earsplitting silence. Decimate, and search for peace. Somewhere... peace... end... give me an end...

But none of you, none of you have the answer. I don't belong here. I wanted so much to be at his side, to be loved, to be his only. And then... I thought maybe I had a place in another's heart. So quickly cut at the root...

I've stopped hoping. Some people live all their lives alone. I'm one of them.

I want to move out. But not for the above reason only. There's too many people here. I didn't like the dog here, I won't lie. It's not like I hated the dog though. I just can't stand the barking late at night when its just me. I didn't want to take care of a dog, but here I am. Combine that with Dolfo's mother... I love the woman, again don't misunderstand me. But there's enough people here. Too many.

I'm socially claustrophobic.

Either way, I'm hoping I can maybe maybe maybe hopefully be able to afford to live just down the street in the apartment complex near the trailor park. Then I can still see you, Dolfo. I don't want to be too far away. I'm far away enough as it is.

Wasabi con is in two weeks, but I don't know if I can get the time off. I don't know what I'll do if I can't go. Be sad, obviously, but still. More too. Even though I don't have the outfits or anything its Wasabi's first year. I wanna be there.

I miss everyone from Gaia. Maybe I can get a laptop before I move, than I'll be regular as I used to be. I miss you all."

"event","My mother... I do not call you mother anymore. I will not call you mom. You have pushed me too far. ""You owe me more than this..."" Is that all you remember? Is that all I am? I hate you. You are my family, and yet I hate you so much. In the eyes of a daughter, her mother is god... I looked for approval from you for so long, I wanted to make you proud. I wanted you to not feel ashamed of me. But apparently nothing I will do can please you, because you do not agree with who I am. I will not change for you. I am not your little Jonnie... My name is Rae. I am Raeshiel, the fallen angel, the goddess of unrequited love. I am a vampire with no soul hunting the streets at night. You are not my family. 

My family are those that I love. Niku and Dolfo, I love you... Joseph, my sister... I miss you. I still read your LJ. I'm not abandoning you, I am still here. I'll always be here. Your last one made me teary, I will admit. I miss those days too, at least parts of them. 

I'm going to move out soon though. Its too crowded here, and I don't like the idea of tip-toeing around my own house.  So I'll find a place for myself close to here, and things will be ok. They will be better...

I know I say this a lot, but I'm tired. Not like physically tired, just jaded with this world. I'm sick of punk korner in Old Town Square, all those children playing rebel in their bright and black pants, filling the air with the reek of plastic and hair dye. I'm sick of the wannabe gangsters with their plastic ""bling"" and oversize shirts and backwards caps. You're all the same. From the cut-and-pastem dime-a-dozen platinum barbie girls to the simpering emo boys. I hate you all and your fake personas and carefully painted visages. It makes the bile rise to my throat; your devious manipulations turn my stomach. It almost makes me wish the world would burn just to rise again like a phoenix from its greasy ashes and start again. Welcome release."

"event","I'm walking a sharp edge these days, in so many ways.

Monetarily... I get paid the week after my phone bill is due. As for rent, its still twice as much as it would have been if Dolfo still had a job. I don't mind, my dear Amy. Anything I can do to help you. So I make just enough at work to live.

Work... ah yes. I love my job. I'm friends with the people I work with. Amy (not you god!)is my style competitor and I like her a lot. Veronica asked me to help dress her for a date... hoo boy. Conservative is an understatement. She went to NDK two years ago though, and she has fruits basket all over her walls... I think I sorely misjudged her the first time I met her. Mary is a character to say the least. I'm still unsure as to who she is. Daniel is an awesome guy too. So is everyone else... 

Here's the problem. I don't have a ride to work anymore thanks to my psycho mother who as we all know has issues with my lifestyle. I don't care. Except now I have to walk the hour and a half to work. In the summer I wouldn't mind that at all. But right now it's <i>fucking cold</i>. Like negative degrees cold. And I go to work at eight in the morning. So I start walking at six. My other problem is pay, but everyone complains about that, so I won't.

Christie hates me. Or maybe I don't even matter in her world. I don't know, and it really doesn't matter. But I wish she didn't kill the happiness in the room with a single sentence. Relax Christie, we're gonna be okkei. I may be late but I pay my rent. The fridge may not be overstocked but we eat well. I'm trying to keep you happy. If that's where all your rancor is from I wish I could ease your worry. I hear all these stories about how nice you used to be,and I wish I could see that christie.

Dolfo I swear to Gackt and every other deity ever known to man, if I have to drag you kicking and screaming through this heart failure I will. And maybe for good, *laugh* if you're screaming we'll set up a microphone and record it for background. But in all seriousness, I hate all this giving up. As I said before, you and I both are too young to act so old. And you... you have so much potential. Such musical talent, and you will always be my favorite highflyer. Why can't you see the wide world before you, in all its possibility? You have a disarming smile that I know charms the girls. My sister is right, you have a warm, smooth voice. And you're handsome to boot. Too kind for your own good though. I wish your heart was still soft, even when I first met you, you seemed happier. Less worried.

But I guess growing up does that to us. The daily routines of work and sleep leave little room for the pleasures we enjoy when we're younger. Or even when we're in school. Friends are always around, afterwards its simply homework. But then you get older and everything is work, bills, and everyone has different schedules. So hard to find time for each other anymore. Don't fall apart, don't forget the moments you share together. Don't stop calling, don't stop playing. Don't let your heart get old, you have to keep believing that the world still has magic in it. Otherwise... how do you live?

But I suppose I'm being a hypocrite. I'm not practicing very much of this. Yes, I know the world is still full of mystery, but that's only because I'm apart of it. But I need a heart to survive, and I don't have mine anymore. Broken up and divided, and precious few of you have taken care of it. Niku... oh my Niku... no. You aren't mine, no matter how much my heart bleeds in sacrifice. You have me on a leash I couldn't break if I even wanted to. So I will be your kitten, even underfed and left in the cold. With one hand you stroke my heart while the other takes a knife to it. Is it bad that I don't mind being on the peripheral, dying but bittersweet smiling as long as you're happy? And then how much I hurt for you, Amy. And I love every tender moment we share. I'm just scared you'll think less of me. Please be honest with me, always. Leon... *cry* Leon! I miss you so much and yet I've never met you. My spirit waits for someday, and snarls at the oppressive distance between us. All the other peices of my heart have rotted in twisted deaths. 

I'm stopping this here. Or I'll fall deeper into the poisonous ash in my mind. I don't want to go there tonight. So I'm going to be shallow and finish this.

My mother is getting surgery Friday on her knee to fix her ACL. She wants me to go to the house and keep her company while my sister is at work. Hopefully I can do my laundry then. Hopefully she hasn't taken that from me too.Otherwise I'm fucked. Oh well.

Oh, and I love you Ash!!! My skirt is looking so awesome!"

I can't breathe, I can't see. I can't sleep, I'll never rest again. I believed in something that didn't exist, and I forgot how far heaven is hell from hell.

"event","Today is my 21st birthday. And I feel the same, albeit just a bit more tired. I shouldn't be, I know I'm so young. But there's so much weight, life is heavy. 

My heart is bruised, bloody and broken. Only love could be giving me the strength to stand and follow you until the end. With one hand you stroke my cheek, and with the other your pushing me to keep my distance. Nothing hurts more than when you turn away. 

Remember? Unrequited love grows stagnant in the heart and turns to poison. 

But I will continue, because there is nothing for me to do but love you with everything I am. Everything I do I have ever done just for you. You are my reason for getting up so many mornings, my reason to keep going. I want to be everything you desire. I want... I just want you to love me like I love you. And I can't ask it of you, I can't. I'm caught in limbo, because I can't love you and I can't stop. I cry because it hurts so much, and I would cry every day just to think of you. I'm dying on the inside, but I'm only living when I'm with you.

But you just want me as a friend, right? Nothing more. You understand that I can be both, right? I'm not going anywhere, I swore to you. I could never leave. You know that.

Heartsick and soulweary...

I still have reason to smile. Don't think that my shadows are completely devoid of life. I'm fortunate to have Leon, Amy, Joseph, Ash, and my friends on Gaia. Although... I miss you Vanessa. It's been a long time, and I miss talking to you like I used to.

New Years came and went, I had a wonderful debilitating flu. Woo for the flu... I hate that little virus. Hate...

My grandparents are here since my sister is home alone. Mother is in India until the 17th. Which is both good and bad I suppose. She won't let my sister hang with Dolfo and Niku and I because she doesn't want her to ""get used to my lifestlye"". Makes me want to snarl in joy. I don't care what she thinks, I am happy where I am at... at least happier than I would be under her oppression. I can be who I am here. I don't have to lie.

Happy Birthday to me... I have survived twenty one years... and I will continue through many more. Who knows what else I might be witness to as the years go by? Despite the frozen hell this town is at the moment, it seems nothing can shake my ongoing hope that maybe tomorrow will be better.

Amy, I wish I could pass this hope to you. I'd let you have it if I could. You need it more than I do. I want to be there for you, to help preserve the flicker of happiness I see flare every so often. Keep smiling, it suits you so much better."

Crying in the desolation that my heart has left behind
Left among the nightmares and withering inside
Frozen heart in all the pieces as it fell to earth and died

Rising from the ashes of a disillusioned past
Bloody hands from holding roses that I knew would never last
Drifting through the ruins of a city burned by lies
I must have cause this desecration, but I don't remember why

I'm the solitary demon haunting corners in the night
Wishing I could love you but I know I'm not alright
I tear myself to pieces but I'll still survive the years
I just want to fade forever, but you'll always hear my tears

-o-o-o-o-

Like a one-winged angel, 
Like the soul of a stillborn child
Too broken to continue
Can't return to heaven or to life

-o-o-o-o-

You're standing behind me
Laughing and smiling
Calling me, come join you
I have to stay
I'm in the way
I can't get past my own reflection

I'll turn around slowly
Once again lonely
No one is there in the darkness
When I look in the mirror
It becomes so much clearer
I'm not in the same world you live in

Pound my fists on the glass
It won't be the last time
I cut myself on broken dreams
There's only one fear
That you'll be too dear
I'll regret losing you forever

I'll turn around slowly
Forever to be lonely
No one to find in the darkness
If I shatter this mirror
I'll never get nearer
And stay in the shadows I live in

Trace the lines up my arms like cracks in crystal. See right through me as I fall to nothing and shatter...

-o-o-o-o-

Tell me I'm sick...

Go ahead... I'm listening...

Just don't be surprised when I laugh.

I forgot the conditions I wrote for myself.
I forgot you belonged to someone else.

You always do, in all the best ways.

Walking together for so many miles...

So I am currently living with my dear friend Dolfo. He's a sweetheart, a really awesome guy. He and Niku both are really dedicated wrestlers. And they're good, in my opinion; Niku always argues with me though. n_n They go by the names Spaz and Hellrazor, together they are the formidable tag team Spazor. *applause* I really don't think he understands what I mean when I talk about my domestic fucker family. You're a part of it too, you nimrod! *hugglesnuggle*

I still feel bad about eating their food. I don't want to clear them out (even though I don't eat a lot I'm still paranoid, shut up) and I always ask. Dolfo's a really good cook. He made these awesome chicken enchiladas and I loved it, even though I seriously dislike mexican food.

What else... work is alright. It gets really tiring on those long stints between breaks, but tomorrow is my day off so yay!!!! I can go to the grocery store and get some food for myself and not feel so bad. I don't get paid until the 14th, then I can pay off my phone bill and hopefully start on christmas presents.

What am I getting everyone? I can't tell you, cause you guys read this! ^^

My mom gives me rides home from work, but if it wasn't so cold and the walk wasn't so long I'd be seriously questioning wether or not it was worth it. Because I get nothing but the same lecture, over and over. No mother, these people are not worthless, they're not useless. I am no better than they are, we all work hard for what we have. Shut the fuck up.

Speaking of job. Niku got a job!!! *emphatic cheering* That means we can finally start saving up for a home. I'm really excited, and really proud of Niku for sticking it out like that. I know he was worried for a long time, and I hope he starts cheering up again. I miss his laughter, and his ridiculous over-emphatic lip-synching. *love*

So I'm here on Christi's computer, watching Dolfo and Niku play Smackdown vs Raw. And I think... I think I'm happy."

"event","Wow,
Ok .. i wrote three letters! 1 got a letter back.. what about the other 2? Welp maybe they just dont have time to waste on 13 year old obessive fans... this is retarted tho.. Okay welp.. Dalton is comeing over today.. emily has been here since thursday.. and yea.. i cant wait for dalton to come over.. I have found better websites then myspace.com my space really agrivates me cuzz i write a logic promise and they dont write back.. Except that one time lance wrote back.. But any way ... www.vampirefreaks.com is a kick butt website its full of gothic kids like me.. ok some of them are extremly weird.. i just talk 2 lyke three people from that site.. they are hot!!! :) LoL ok.. uh.. yea.. i'm gonna go.. and i am gonna like.. stop thinking about a logic promise for a second and put my mind on some thing else.. maybe i'm a little 2 obsessive about that band.. it still would be nice to get a freakn letter back. i mean i kno they dont have all the time in the world and if they did they wouldnt waste there wonderful time on me! ... So i find it sorta pointless to write letters to give to judy to give to lance.. and to e-mail that freakn band! I'M DONE! im not gonna be as obsessive.. untill tomaro.. right now i just need to keep my mind on gettin confirmed and haveing fun with dalton.. i dont have time to think about why that freakn awsome band wont write back..

Some one imed this cute little story.. 

-This is so sweet:
A girl asked a boy if she was pretty, he said ""No"". She asked him if he wanted to be with her forever, he said ""No"". Then she asked him if he would cry if she walked away, he said ""No"". She had heard enough; she needed to leave. As she walked away he grabbed her arm and told her to stay. He said ""you are not pretty, you are beautiful. I don`t want to be with you forever, I need to be with you forever. And I wouldn't cry if you walked away, I would die.""-

^^ Yea that is the story... i was in the yahoo rock chat room like i always am... yahoo id is.. ILuvDalton4l yea well any way i was talking to this kid for ever and then he told me this story and told me to send it to every one on my yahoo buddy list so i did and yeaa..

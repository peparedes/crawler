It's so quiet. 
Aside from the important things like people, love and art, Snow has to be one of my very most favored things in the world.  

Lex and Katie.  I realize that you both can't experience it from where you are.  I'm sorry.  You're in your own wonderful places, But snow is something that can't be replaced!
Snow!"

Peru.  Who knew?

I love and enjoy all kinds of people, but my sister is the only person 
whom I will always be happy to see.  I never have to be in the right 
mood to socialize.  She is simply my favorite.  I love her the most.
I don't even know how long she will be gone.  
It will be at least a month.  If not- six.

Ugh ugh.  Won't get used to this. Maybe I'll just take a long nap untill 
she gets back.  
Man time in general has been a thief, as of late."

Not that I recall but someone did at my last job, though she was pouring them over a sink so they didn't spill on to the floor.
It was the first time have have heard someone honestly say,
""*sigh* I spilt the beans!""  
I laughed.

I always regret so would take that in a heartbeat.  Maybe three heartbeats.  Things I would like to take back tend to habe to do with people and people are more important than money anyday.
I think its just that I worry more than others.  Some don't need to take anything back not because money is more important but because they are strong."

Now I see that there is an advantage!  I get to see everybodies (both of them) posts before they are washed away under a tide of other ones.  

If I had lots of friends then I woould not be able to see everything my friends have to say because by the time I got around to checking, there would be so many more that the new post will be old and gone already (like this one) and nobody would see it (like this one) because there are too many others.  

Maybe that is OK because some posts are just jibberish (like this one) but anything my friends have to say are cherished to some extent (not so much like what I am saying now)

"event","So the concert was kick arse!  Sure I was expecting to enjoy myself but my expectations were exceeded.  The first people were cool yes and I was glad that they sung that pirate song.  

You see, Emily, Ken and I have been on the lookout for good pirate songs and they have made compilations (my sister is a pitate is spirit if you didn't know).  

""Tender Forever"" and ""Squeese me I Squeal"" were great.  I was amazed by how honest they and ""The Blow"" were as people.  Sure some bands are ""Genuine"" meaning they try to come across as ""people"" by not acting like themselves (which may be the worse of two evils anyway) so people would like them.  But they didn't have to try, they just were.  

Furthermore, (I feel like I'm writing an essay) ""The Blow"" was  .  Wait.  heh.  I almost said ""The Blow was great"".  What's wrong with me lately?

""The Blow"" was soo cool!  (There) I should be ashamed to like such a poppy (heh) gal but there was no mistaking it.  She was great.  She was scathingly honest as well but in such a different way.  

""I hope to make a-lot of money off this song""  Ha ha!  I couldn't believe it!  Ditpite phrases like that she still came across as strangely genuine.  I shamelessly liked her (The Blow).  But what I liked best was how they were soo intergrated in to their music (T.F., S.M.I.S. and T.B.)

There was something about them.  

Argh!  I wish I could have gone to the after party!  There was only one car between Em, Kev and I and they had to get home.  They suggusted I drive back once I dropped them off but I thought it was too late and that I would have to do homework (group project) early.

Here I am.  11:44 and it hasn't started.  I could have gone after all.  No wait.  Ems car was blocked in by someone so they couldn't have gone home if I had gone to the party.  

Woah!  This is a long post!   

Katie!  How was the after party?  Were the bands there?  I would loved to have met them.  Or rather.  I would have loved to have hovered in the shadows sipping my juice while thinking of all the cool conversations I could have with so many cool people.  

Lex!  You would have enjoyed the show though the music is not as much your type.  Well... I don't know.  Would you have liked it?  

Those gals make me want to be creative.  Well I am but I waste time by not being creative.  Time to get in gear!"

Today I found out what the name of that thing is that connects your tongue to the bottom of your mouth.  I had to run many searches and even stumbled across a friggin porn site after searching ""Tongue Diagram"".  I guess I walked right in to that one.  

Finally I found a kids site on ""Your amazing body"" (sounds dirty) that had more streightforward information than any of the Science Encyclopedias (spelled sooo wrong...) 

In the end, I forgot the name of the thing after all.  I appear like a silly goose seeing that I remember the porn sight but these things stick to the cleanest mind.  And mine as well.

I wish my history paper that I put off didn't take so much time.  

Hey, this character I am acting as is a Ciockney (from eastern london).  Mr D said he doesn't like assigning monologues with characters with accents as it distracts from the rest of it.  But my character has a potentially strong accent.

"event","I started writing this thinking that I has important things to update.  Well, there's nothing to say that hasn't already been said.  Maybe I'm just filling up space.  

Well, here's a wasted post.  

Actually, I have that feeling a-lot lately.  I'll be with my family or friends and I'll have the feeling that theres something I should be saying.  It's not just a small urge , instead I get the feeling that I'm missing something crucially important.  Do you ever get that feeling?  

My A.D.D. probably doesn't help either.

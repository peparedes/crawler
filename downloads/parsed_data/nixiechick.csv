I got some money cuz I just got paid.
And how I wish I had someone to talk to,
I'm in an awful way!""

NO ONE has been around today or tonight.  I spent the whole day thinking that soon enough someone would be available to hang out.  Not the case.  So today I pretty much just lumped around.  Went to work.  Took a nap (which dammit I deserved!  I went to Cedar Point with Beck last night and I was beat!).  Rollerbladed to the bank.  Hung out with my family and went to the driving range with dad.  I deserve some kind of recognition for being the only person in the world with absolutely zero aptitude for golfing.

In other news, the bank is not so bad.  I hate being ""the college girl"" and I hate not being a forty-something mom.  But, barring the tricky stuff and my nerves, it's pretty fun to be a teller!  Aside from the crazy people I've already gone off about, it's pretty exciting to balance and stuff once you get the hang of being at a window. And everyone I work with is really nice.  So maybe it won't be so bad.  I just hope it doesn't get repetitious.   I'm glad work doesn't totally suck though...otherwise I'd be majorly pissed about getting up early, driving to Lorain and working somewhat longer days than I am used to."

"event","So, today was my first day on a teller window at the bank and I waited on my first customer!  I feel so responsible handing all that money.  Pretty much my bank is full of jagmos though...like, the weirdest people come in.  I'm not a big fan of anyone I work with, but our customers make the day hilarious.
For example, <b>lots</b> of old people come in one day and take out a lot of cash from their account.  For one thing, if they need that much money, they should take it in some other form, not cash though, bc that's not very safe.  So that's one strike against these people.  But then they come back the next day and redeposit all or most of it!  What is the point!??  I think they just want something to do.  It's sad, but there are lots of people that continue the cycle of withdrawal and depositing<b>daily</b>!
Then, similarly, there are these other pitiful old and/or simple-minded people that come in three or four or more times the first banking day of the month, when all their bills come to their house.  They make these trips a considerable length of time apart from each other, but all on the same day.  And this is the honest-to-God reason:  These people get their mail at home, open one bill, go to the bank to pay it off, go home, open the next piece of mail, find the next bill and then return to the bank to pay it.  They might even do that several times in a row with each incoming bill...whether it be a VISA payment, their water, gas, telephone or electric bill, or their loan payments.  <b>I do not understand that!</b>  Open all your mail at once!  If you have this kind of time, get a job...old people I understand, but younger people, what are you thinking???
Now those two situations are common occurrences...the tellers don't even flinch at these customers.  I'm sure I, too, will soon be desensitized, but for now, I find the whole things really amusing.  The third thing that I saw happen today with a customer, and that I am sure similar things will happen again was this:  Some guy came in and deposited $20 into his account, which only had a previous balance of $2.40.  At first, I didn't think much of it because I figured that he probably had just recently emptied the account out and he was just wanting to fill it back up slowly.  However, I checked his statements and notice that he definitely brings in very small increments of cash quite often and then takes similarly small increments out every few days.  What is he thinking?  Why does this gentleman even use a bank??  Is he worried he's going to misplace a $20 bill or something???  He's certainly not gaining enough interest to bother.  The trip to the bank isn't worth the gas money!  Moron.
So, that is just a random sampling of how fun it can be to be a bank teller in Lorain...thank God something there spices up my day!"

That's gonna be embarrassing...but whatever.  It's kinda funny how other people just act stupid when they drink...but not me...I only increased exponentially in hyperness with each drink.  So, if you know me, you know it doesn't take much for me to have any fun.
All in all, a good time was had last night.   I'm glad there were no ""complications"" during our last night of Notre Dame Freshmen <b>debauchery</b>!"

"event","Dang...it's been a while since I posted, for two reasons A) my life has been incredibly boring and B) I have been completely overwhelmed with work.  This morning I took my last regular Bio exam, participated in my last PE class, and turned in my last paper for the semester.  And, once again, this morning re-enforced the key lesson I learned this semester: On three hours of sleep, cell signaling seems really complicated and racquetball becomes a very difficult test of hand-eye coordination.
Tomorrow is my last day of classes...and my Finals are next Tuesday through Friday.  And then I finally get to go home!  And THEN STAR WARS COMES OUT on my birthday!  (Yep, I'm a nerd.  I know it.)  Jean Ann even said she'd come with me!
So yeah, nothing else to say.  I'm off to dinner.  Hopefully, I will post more often now."

"event","So, my roommate, Leigh, definitely has mono and packed up all her things and left tonight!  It's really quite sad!  I feel bad for her...I wouldn't be ready to go home just yet.  
I have very mixed feelings, however, about living alone.  Like, its weird having some of her stuff here, but not all of it.  The walls are clear, so the room feels majorly empty.  I like being able to sleep and wake whenever I want, but it's definitely a little lonely.  This is definitely making me realizing that it's not that bad having a roommate and I'm also starting to wonder why I've always wanted a single..."

"event","Tonight at LaFun I was telling people how the Forensics chicks and I used to ""stalk"" people.  And I realized that we had issues.  Without even trying I was able to name 19 people off the top of my head that we used to keep tabs on/crack jokes about!  That's a lot!  No wonder we had to hide at Speech and Debate tournaments.  So, the thing is, I kind of miss such activity.  But it's tough without homeroom mail!  So, the executive decision has been made that next year there will be some serious activity.

"event","Tonight my little sister made her Confirmation.  I'm a dork, but I think that's exciting.  I am happy for her.  She's an adult in the Church!  Hurray! :-)  Yeah, I don't know, but since I've come to school I miss her a lot.  I used to think of her as just a lil runt, but she's growing up and we've grown much closer.  I can't wait till she goes to Mags next year!  Also, my brother was her sponsor and I was his, so I called home and talked to them about it for a bit.  I love the fact that I can the three of us share our faith.  It made me miss home a little, but that's ok.  

Tonight has definitely been a homebody type of evening:  I also IMed with Sara for a bit.  It was great to talk to her and gossip DQ...like always!  And then Beth and I talked on the phone.  I hadn't really talked to her in a bit.  She's definitely fun to talk with...I always feel like I have a ton of catching up to do when I talk to her.  I hope we are able to become better friends again this summer.  

Summer...damn...it's soon.  That reminds me I need to study!"

Sometimes I can't even explain why I feel the way I do, but I know I feel it.  It's really crappy when you are able to recognize that you have really dramatic emotional highs and lows.  I don't' mean to be that way, but it happens.  And I'm sick of explaining myself when I don't even understand."

"event","I just want to say that I love Vespers!  My Theology prof had us go to Vespers for extra credit and I did that two weeks ago.  Tonight is the third time I've been.  And I really like going.  
1) The Magnificat is sung.
2) They sing some other pretty Latin song about Mary.
3) The Basilica is incredible!
4) They do this whole candle lighting thing that's really pretty.
5) It's a cool way to start the evening/end the day.
6) The procession in the very beginning is majorly traditional-looking and cool.  It makes me feel like I'm at the Vatican.
7) Noelle and Greg come with me!
8) Lots of good-smelling incense is used.
9) The choir is awesome.
10)That whole Alleluia piece is mighty beautiful.

Didn't even drink that much and I still had a lot of fun.  Then we sat around at Siegfried.  The guys crack me up.  They were all over the place last night.  I even got yelled at by Father John for being too loud and ""obviously having too much to drink,"" when I definitely wasn't drunk.  How horrible... I really liked him too!  But we had a great time, regardless.  Met some new people and had a fairly drama-free night with my crew.  I am really glad everything worked out while Darc was here.  We woke up this morning and blared Indigo Girls!  It was a true Magnifi-moment.  Yay for Darcy's visit!"

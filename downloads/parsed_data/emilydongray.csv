"event","Sorry for disappearing for so long, but as some of you know, the lead-up to xmas is really important for retail and I was totally run off my feet and very crazed generally.

I had a lovely 3 days of xmas fun at Chris' parents house. I got an Ixus 60 camera for Christmas and was gifted with a personal DAB randomly (""oh, I have one lying around you can have""). We got a 500gb NAS from his parents. Plus I bought my lovely man a Wii, which he is killing his shoulders and back on as we speak; tip: those things really burn calories!

Plan to start my music journal again in the new year (sorry to those of you who actually read it, and thanks for reading it *blush* ).

I just had a giant glass of orange juice; I feel like I have a giant rotting turkey in my gut - really want to detox and cleanse myself. We went to Sainsbury and I bought so much fruit! If anyone has any miracle digestive treatments, please share.

My arms are massive after having to cart huge boxes around for the last 2 months - not sure how I feel about having giant man-arms, but I plan to get myself some punch-pads so I can hit stuff; sometimes I feel like I need to hit stuff.

I plan to have a Phillip K Dick all-nighter, first it was planned for the dvd release of Scanner Darkly, but that unfortunately coincides with Chris' birthday weekend, so now I'm thinking I'll have it on his death-day which is March 2 - although I'm not so sure it's cool to celebrate his death... probably just have it when I can be arsed."

Thanks for taking the T and A and C test! Based on your selections, the results are clear:  you show an attraction to <b><font color=""#006600"">larger breasts</font></b>, <b><font color=""red"">larger asses</font></b>, and <b><font color=""blue"">sexier composures</font></b> than others who've taken the test.

<br><br>
Note that <b>you like women overall curvier than average</b>. 

<br><br>
My third variable, <b>""cuteness""</b> is a mostly objective measure of how innocent a given model looked. It's determined by a combination of a lot of factors: lack of dark eye makeup, facial expression, posture, etc. If you scored high on that variable, you are either really nice OR you're into deflowering teens. If you scored low, you are attracted to raunchier, sexier, women. <i>In your case, your lower than average score suggests you appreciate a sexier, naughtier look. Kudos!</i>

"event","Went to <a href=""http://www.themightyboosh.com/"">The Mighty Boosh</a> stage show last night at Peterborough. It was pretty good, except every time I laughed I coughed, so I coughed through the entire thing. Peterborough's Broadway Theatre was quite nice, I enjoyed it as a smaller venue as even being at the back isn't that far away.

<lj-cut text=""review contains spoilers"">
The show had all five cast members, Vince Noir, Howard Moon, Bollo, Nabu and Bob Fossil, and brought out all the favourite characters, Old Gregg, The Cockney Hitcher, The Psychedelic Monk to name a few. They were really good on stage, the scene changes, the use of props - or lack of (they mimed lots), the sound cues were great, there was lots of song and dance - fair amount of interaction with audience, and (my favourite) they broke character a few times also. At one point I found myself detached and able to see that we were at a pantomime for adults - this was about the time the rabbit chased Vince around the theatre and then raped him. Thoroughly enjoyable.

You get high marks on appearance.  Just make sure you balance it out with other qualities.<br><b>Confidence</b> - You are sure of yourself and confident of your abilities.  Displays of confidence go a long way when attracting a date.<br><b>Intelligence</b> - Your sharp intellect is a valuable asset.  Use your intelligence wisely; avoid condescension. Quiet, confident intelligence is very attractive.<br><b>Friendliness</b> - Your friendliness makes you approachable and fun to be around.  A wide circle of friends also works to your advantage on the dating scene.<br><b>Flirtiness</b> - Flirting is a good way to break the ice, and you are a pro at it. Being flirtatious will open up many dating opportunities.<br>

Appearance is, of course, important, but vanity is undesireable.  The only people you will attract are the superficial.<br><b>Temper</b> - You need to work on controlling your temper.  Don't let your anger get the best of you.  A calm and rational persona is important when dating.<br><b>Humorlessness</b> - You need to learn how to take a joke, or better yet how to tell a good one.  A well-developed sense of humor is high on the list of desired traits for daters.<br><b>Financial Issues</b> - Your financial situation is not in good shape, and this does not bode well for you on the dating scene. Try to get on top of your financial difficulties.<br><b>Selfishness</b> - You think too much of yourself and <i>your</i> needs.  You must learn to put your partner first and tend to <i>his</i> needs.<br>

Anyway, I had gone to see <a href=""http://www.deadmedia.co.uk/"">The Resistance</a>, who were Really Good - again. I have plans to go up to The Cavern in Liverpool in May when they play there - like a proper groupie. :) Their music makes me feel so euphoric, the gorgeous static, such full, warm sounds... Technically, the headliners were Stellastarr; they were well produced, but boring soulless indie rock.

Today my recommend would be Jesus & The Mary Chain - Psychocandy, or Suicide - Suicide.

Woke up late and am still ill. At least it means that any food I ate last night I didn't absorb! Pork fat? nope. Raspberry sorbet? nope. Carbs/fat from au gratin potatoes? nuhuh. This illness is doing my body wonders, in a twisted sort of way. Boss was cunt on phone about me being still ill, but then he said he was only saying what he was required to tell me from staff handbook, so I guess it wasn't his fault. Going to try and not eat anything today (problem is my body wants me to eat - i am really hungry).

Neil was sacked yesterday by his best friend. He and his mate run a night at a club, where Neil DJ's (Soul Tree). *pauses to go to loo for 25th time today* His ""friend"" said he has got some one else to DJ from now on, so tonight will be his last night there. Neil took it well considering. As far as i know, he didn't cut himself. However, he didn't cry or get angry like I would have - i think he silently blames himself and thinks he is crap now - which he isn't. Either way, it means I have to go out tonight - and it WILL be awkward and I will have to be ultra-supportive. It is not going to be a good night.

Going to watch more dvds today. Perhaps <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382189/"">Summer of Love</a> which <lj user=barty> got me for my birthday. :)

Spoke to my sister on the way to club. She is at the point where she is thinking about having children. Strangely, I feel ok about it, proud even. If I can't have children, she should. I mean, it does emphasise my own failure, but if it means she succeeds then it is ok. I feel so stupid having let class and pride get in the way of my dreams.

Had a really bad day Saturday as I was tired and kept saying stupid things that offended people; ended up crying in the toilets. I was so angry at myself for having no filter between my thoughts and my mouth. grrrr.

Sunday was excellent! my friend came round and picked up my broken drum for re-skinning. It was good to see him, he is having a good and busy time. Then a work friend came round for HDD swapping fun. we got pizza and watched a couple of dvd's. One of which was Closer in which I was scared to find my double in Natalie Portman.

Today I am going to tidy up, work on getting my head round Reason s'more and then go into town for lunch. Not sure if I am out tonight or not.

Work! Recently at a Work Do I was told I see ""short"", ""terse"" and/or ""spiky"". I can imagine your smug looks right now. Well, I was unaware this was how I was being perceived and took it a little badly. I felt low about it, but in my dynamic way, decided to repair damaged relations and really put lots of effort and attention on my work. I am now having a much better time, really enjoying myself.

Musically, still analysing myself to find my musical core and find myself as a musician; it is a time-consuming, thought intensive process. Might lj some of my thoughts in a filtered thread so you can see my development. Woo!

My birthday is on Sunday 27th Nov, would like to do things with folks on Friday/Saturday - clear your schedules if you love me enough.

It was good seeing you over Thanksgiving.  I missed you guys soo much and I'm glad I finally got to see you.
But now that the stress is building to insane levels, its about time to call it quits.  

I QUIT!!!!!!!!

"event","I am a horrible person.

I have done something that I consider to be worse than death.

I have broken the trust of someone that I care about, and it was completely unintentional.

When our RA came in and was acting all secretive about an invitation to something (as if it was a Secret Society), I thought that was what it should be.  A secret.  But my curiousity got the better of me.

So when she ""went to bed"" I quietly went over and took a peek at it, but she jumped up at the last second.  Now she thinks I go through her stuff all the time.

I have never liked breaking the trust that people place in me.  I do think it is worse than death...and that right now I should be dead.  She didn't hear the tears that I cried into my pillow last night.  My heart feels like its been torn in two and the pieces ""pancaked by an elephant,"" as my history professor would say.  

Is there an opening on 3 South next term?  Maybe I should move down there...where I'm friends with the RA and several of the girls down there.

I don't feel like I know my floor anymore.

So go ahead, 5 Middle.  Shun me.  I completely and totally deserve it.

And Amanda?  I'm sorry...oh so sorry...  And I feel like I can never look you in your eyes anymore.  Rest assured that if I even think of going near your stuff anymore that I will slap myself or something.  I trained myself to do that - and its worked.  

I'm such a horrible person..."

"event","Its my roommate's birthday as well as the day of the 2004 presidential election.  I also feel that its an appropriate time to update, as its been awhile.  

Not a lot of people are aware of my actual political standpoint.  I hate discussing politics because it turns the best of friends against each other.  Only a few of my friends know...two, in fact.  And they share my views.  So, to the world, here are my views:

I HATE BUSH WITH A PASSION.  Look, I'm sorry.  Sure...he has helped those wealthy white men with tax cuts, but what about those of us who AREN'T rich white folks?  I've also had to deal with health care on a first person basis...and you know what?  We totally got shafted.  AND WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE ""SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE?!?""  I mean, seriously.  Not everyone is Catholic.  Our founding fathers had originally intended for us to be a nation for those of us who were oppressed.  However, what is going on today?  We shun those people who want gay marriage.  We discriminate against those of any sort of Arabic culture.  WHAT THE F***?!?  

But don't get me wrong.  I'm not too fond of Kerry.  I mean, sure...  I'm a Democrat, and I'm not ashamed of it.  However, I think that the Democrats could have done better.  I think John Edwards is a good man...and if it were between VPs, I'd most certainly vote for him in a heartbeat....hey, wait...aren't a lot of people named ""John Edwards"" these days?  Sorry...lol - random thought.

Anyway, that was my two cents about the election.  Nothing much else is going on...  I've actually got homework too so this'll be short...but I'll update sooner or later...  I'm just nervous about tonight...because our future is determined in a couple of hours.  Why do I have a bad feeling about this?"

I had a total bitching session with Missy and basically brought EVERYTHING off of my chest.  She made me tell everything.  It was nothing big but she totally let me see everything in a new light.  

The noon mass group has definitely brought me in (as best as they could...lol).  I mean, sure.  I'm still trying to find my niche in the group.  A lot of the peoples have been around for at least a year or so and they have become close.  Its hard coming in later; I'm not going to lie.  But they have accepted me.

""The group loves you.  They'll go to the ends of the earth for you.""

That has never been said to me before, and you know what?  It makes me sooooo happy.  Seriously.  They've almost become like family to me.  I've only known them for a month or so now.  What's this?  They've already given their lives to helping me? Okay...not so drastically...but they have already said that if I need them to call on them.  Not commonly said to one who has known them for a short time...

I will admit, I did want to hang out with them...you know, cause mischief.  I'm all right with not doing it anymore.  After all, I'd probably get on their nerves and they'd probably get on mine.  The friendship would be ruined, eh?  I don't want that.  Not at all.  I love them too much... :-D

"event","You know, I realized something today.  In the restructuring of my life that I am going through right now, I have become dependent on people.  Too damn dependent, if you ask me.  I am finding myself pulling my hair out over them.  I have come to a realization...a harsh one at that...that no matter what happens, no matter who I become, no matter how my future turns out here, I will always be left alone.

I mean, sure.  I have friends.  I love my friends dearly.  I would do anything in my power for them and I support them to no end (just ask Chris Albanese...).  I love everyone that has forced me to get to know them.  I love them to death.  They have always told me that I'm more than welcome to come along to whatever they want to do.  However, I can't go if they don't tell me when and where...which has been happening a lot recently.  Its the thought that counts!  I mean it!  If you ask me to do something and I can't make it, I still appreciate the thought that you invited me!  

Just one of these days I'd like to go out and party.  Not drink, just break loose with my friends.

Inside of me is a little girl who is just dying to get out.  She has been trapped inside forever and has never had a chance to just let loose and go wild.  

I fear that if she doesn't get out soon then she really *will* die.

But you know what?  Whatever happens...happens.  If I do end up alone, then I'm just going to have to accept it.  And whatever fate decides to deal out to me, I will welcome it with open arms...no matter how painful.

So...until next time, my friends...stay true to who you are.  Know you will always have someone to support you right here.  

((A side note:  Can you tell that the emotional scars are deep?  Too deep?  The homily for the Ghetto Mass struck home last night.  It was about those who were abused when they were kids and the hopelessness they feel.  I often feel that.  Fr. Chris also said that we should keep praying and hold out for it to pass.  When will it pass?  This has been around for about 8 years now.  8 years.  8 goddamn years.  

Is it any consolation that Christina Aguilera's 'Fighter' just came up on the video list that I'm playing in the background?  A bit.  Every bit helps...)"

Its been awhile, hasn't it?  

A lot has happened recently...  I broke down for the first time in front of the group last Friday (the noon mass group...).  Wow...I've had one hell of a weekend...  Yeah - it was scary on Friday because it was the first time that I broke down twice in a week (earlier was on Tues).  They didn't leave me, though.  Well, Jon had to leave, but he had an excuse (he's also an RA and had to go on duty in an hour or so) but everyone else didn't leave me.  I've only known these people for about 3 weeks or so, and they're treating me like family.  I've never asked for a better group of friends...  It makes me question what is going to happen in the future.  It makes me question a whole lot more, actually.  Am I ready to get back into the Catholic Faith after a 4 year hiatus?  I mean, sure...I stayed with the Music Ministry profession, but the religion is so much more than that.  Am I really ready to jump back in after I experienced the horror that was Eric Severin?  He's the last person that I want to be like...and I'm afraid that I'll become like him...  

We'll just have to play it by ear, then.  I don't want this to ruin my friendship or whatever with everyone.  

I'm going to update later, mainly because I a) want to look over my counterpoint and b) I'm tired and I want to try and nap before my Monday @ 1...which might not happen, but we'll see.  Laters!"

As much as I almost decided to skip out today due to a migraine, I'm SOOOOOOOOO glad I didn't!  It was soo much fun, and I even got to fiddle! :-D :-D  Did I mention how much I LIVE for fiddling?  

I just have to figure out what message I left Chris...  Haha - I was buried under my sweater/hoodie and he walked in and was like, ""Uhh...hi?""  :-P  He left a message on my answering machine and I was at my duo meeting so there's no way I could have gotten it!  I felt bad because I think Marty was waiting for me forever...  :-( But, hey...we made a killer duo on ""We Are One in the Lord""!

I played at the memorial mass for Cindy Scott last night, and I started to think of the subject that if something happens to me and I die, what will happen to me?  Its almost sickening how much I have thought of this, but one can't be too careful...  I don't want anything to happen, but I can't predict the future.  I don't want to see the future...what I am predestined for...  

I will admit, I just want to be reassured that I won't die alone.  I have never dated anyone, nor have I had a boyfriend.  I just want someone who will listen to me and just respect my feelings.  I'm not a toy, I'm not a prize...hell no, I'm far from it.  How long is it going to be?  *sigh* I guess I will just have to sit back and let life take its course...I wish it would hurry up, but what else can I do?

I have been having problems with my bad knee again - and it isn't in the front like last time.  Its in the back, which is supposedly where my ACL is torn.  I e-mailed my mom about it and she's forwarded the e-mail to my orthopedic doctor.  

I am finally going to (hopefully) get my ACL fixed.  With worker's comp issues and whatnot, I'm expecting it to happen sometime around November (which, if we can time it right, may end up having recovery time fall over Thanksgiving Break...which means that I wouldn't be able to go back to Cincinnati Mills right away...).  

I'm hoping that I can be out only two weeks MAX.  I can fashion my viola to become a backpack, so that won't be too bad.  Not bad at all.  I can talk to...someone, and see if I can stash my viola in the String Room when I'm not using it.  I'm going to have to get someone to get me for the Ghetto Mass - Chris, Marty, Andy...whoever.  I'm going to have to figure out what to do about the noon mass - maybe talk to Jonathan and see if he'll go down with me in case something happens and I slip, fall, and die.  Well, not that extreme, but you get the idea...

I will be the first to admit that I am scared shitless about going under the knife again, but I'm in need of this so I'll put up with it.

I've officially joined two music ministry groups up here - the noon mass and the Ghetto Mass.  Its really quite amusing seeing the two directors...well, three if you include Andy.  Both he and Chris are somewhat...protective?  No...that's not the word...  clingy?  That's not *the* word I want, but its close enough.

Whatever...you get the idea.  Only a few people through my life have been my friends.  Never have this many people cared about me.  So...to all those who have helped me through this: (WARNING:  incoming list...lol)

The Showcase gang (Heather, Sherri, Shannon, TJ, Chris, Lessie)

Hillary Ross
Jessica Norgaard (the bestest RA EVER ;-D)
Margie & Missy (a.k.a. the ""other"" half of the viola section in Orchestra)
Dr. Magnuson (YES!  Believe it or not...he is quite watchful over me - he offered to help me with triads when I missed that class because I couldn't breathe...haha - its all about the EXTREME THEORY!!! XD)
And everyone else I couldn't think of right now...don't feel left out!  You have still helped!  My mind is just going in 50 million directions right now!

Anyway, you guys have helped me more then you may even realize.  Before I came up to Dayton, I was trying to pull myself out of a severely depressed/suicidal state...which is why we ended up moving to Hamilton from Cincinnati.  I have never been able to pull it out completely.  It has been 3 and a half years...

Why?

Main reason:  I have never been wanted by anyone.  People would never appreciate me or my talents.  There have been times when I have just lived for my music...and not even for me.  I strongly believe that with the help of everyone up here including the people that I have mentioned above, I will be able to overcome this obstacle for good and hopefully move on to live an even better life then what I have had.  

These things happen for a reason.  I strongly believe that God has sent you all to help me.  Just know that you all have helped me in more ways then you know.  I feel that I should owe you all my life...after all, you did help me to keep it.  

Thank you.

Thank you all for everything.  

Thank you.

David Haas, the liturgical music composer, is on campus.  Or, at least he was on campus.  He did this workshop thingy over the past two days.  He was even supposed to do a mass.  It was today at 10.  

I e-mailed this guy who doesn't return e-mails or calls and told him I wanted to help with the mass.  So I'm without details, and I talk to Chris, the guy who extended the invitation to everyone.  He said he'd talk to him and pass the information on to me.  

I haven't heard from him.  Even if he's deliberately trying to avoid me because he forgot to talk to him, I wouldn't care.  Its just the pure fact that I never got a response that upsets me.  I don't ask for much, but when someone says they will do something I'll hold them to it.  It hurts when they don't.  It hurts a lot."

I relapsed today.  There's a new cut on my right arm.  It wasn't brought on normally - it wasn't stress or pain or anything like that.  I don't remember how it was brought on.  Not at all.  Last thing I remember is that I opened an e-mail from home and the next thing I knew I was holding a pair of scissors and I had sliced my arm.  Not my wrist like the last time this happened.  My arm.  I was lucky.  This has only happened once before...and that was when I ended up slicing my right wrist.  I have been extremely lucky.  Too lucky.  I didn't cut deep, but deep enough to give me tendonitis there...an ever-present memory of that time...that night...  I will be the first one to admit that I'm afraid.  Not afraid of cutting, mind you.  Afraid of not knowing what brought this on...and not knowing how to work to correct the problem.  That's what frightens me more than anything.

Just look at my previous post if you want to see some background...though I really don't remember what I put right now...(damn fatigue).

I really should have seen it coming.  I have just had the worst week with me getting sick so quickly.  Today I felt like even though people were talking to me, they didn't *want* to talk to me.  They wanted to go do something else...go talk with *their* friends, go off to work on assignments...just do something other than spending a couple of minutes talking to me.  Am I that bad?  

*sigh*

Oh, well...  I felt like that for most of the day - people were too busy to spend a couple of minutes talking to me.  Not talking at me.  Not trying to get away to do other things.  Talking to me.  Believe it or not, I can get some really deep conversations going.  I have also given out advice more wiser than my true age.  I'm not the shy person that everyone makes me out to be.  They just haven't given me the chance to prove myself.

I come from a world where I was berated for every little thing I do.  I know that it may seem frustrating for awhile, but just bear with me.  It has gotten to the point that I have become timid at first to do things...but with a little encouragement I'll dive right in and do things...and hopefully come out successfully.  Just give me a chance!  

Okay...I'm done with my rant.  If you want me, I'm pretty sure you'll know where to find me..."

"event","I have just decided that we have the most cynical floor on Marycrest.  Seriously.  The fire alarm just went off about 40 minutes ago.  I mean, sure.  If its just a fire *drill* we'll just hang out for about 3 minutes or so.  No.  This fucker went on for about 25 minutes.  Yep, 25 minutes.  And what do we do?  We sit up on the fifth floor like, ""TURN IT OFF!""  A few of the girls went downstairs.  I'll admit that I soon followed like 2 minutes before it ended.  For 20 minutes, however, we all just seriously stood up there like, ""WTF?  TURN IT OFF!""  A lot of us just went back to our rooms, stared out at the people who were outside, and just went about our business as best as we could.  

We're totally going to get our asses killed when there is a real fire.

ROCK ON, 5 MIDDLE!

I'm already planning our escape routes."

"event","Yes...within the first week of school, who gets sick?!?  ME!!!  Its this congestion thingy and cough which is really getting on my nerves.  Supposedly its going around and whatnot and of course I had to wait until I couldn't breathe or whatever before I went to the health center!  GAH!  At least I get to miss Aural Skills, Theory, and Brass Ped.  I'm going to be so far behind...ugh...

Oh, well...that's my little random entry.  At least I won't die from whatever mysterious ailment I seemed to have caught.  Joy.  Rapture.  Whatever other happy word you can think of.  Blech."

"event","I will be the first to say that I miss most of the aspects of my old life.  I miss my friends, I miss my ""pretty kitty"", I miss the managers from Showcase (primarily Cincinnati Mills, but I also miss Kathy and John...).  I miss KB.  I miss a lot of my life...  It hurts when I think about it.  Things are never going to be the same again - and there are a lot of times that I just want to go back to my old life...my security blanket.  That blanket died 8 years ago...and a large part of me died along with it.  That's when everything started - including my self-mutilation...  Its gotten deeper...I have my first scar right now - its getting fainter, but its still there.  I'm so scared right now...and yet, I'm not.  I have a couple of people up here I can go to if the urge gets too bad.  

I'm not supposed to be like this...I'm supposed to be the strong one.  My mom thinks that I've been lucky...that I never had to go on anti-depressants.  I don't know how much longer I can keep this up before I do something terribly, terribly bad.  I can only do so much...but when I get to the point that I feel like I have nowhere to turn, well, what else am I supposed to do?  I just wish that I could figure all of this out...that I could have the emotional support that I so longingly crave, that I could have a group of close friends, that I could have a family...a family who cares for me and in turn I could care for them.  

Kathy says that a person needs hugs daily in order to maintain happiness in their life.  When was the last time I had a hug?  Last night.  Before that?  Last Sunday.  

I want a hug right now...

I need a hug right now...

I want to be in the company of those I care about...

...but they aren't here.  

I have been surrounded by so many people this past week, and I have never felt more alone.  I just want to crawl into a hole and rot there.  Alone.  Like I always will be...alone...

And yet, I don't feel any animosity or any of that complicated stuff.  I will still be there for anyone that needs me - if someone wants to talk, I will always listen.  I just don't know if I will have anyone to go to when I need them...

*sigh* Life is cruel..."

"event","haha...after I've had this forever and a day I finally get around to updating it.  (Yes...this is mainly for you Heather!  lol) So...I am finally in the full swing of things up here at UD.  We (meaning 'OCMEA') had a car wash to raise money for conference in February (back home!  W00T!).  I had fun and all but we were outside from 11-3...and no sunblock.  Needless to say that the vast majority of us are burned.  I myself have second degree burns and had a bad case of sun poisoning yesterday.  The poisoning has gotten better - I'm not getting sick (as much) but it has also wiped me out.  I have no clue how I'm going to get through the ghetto mass tonight...  and no, its not a real ghetto mass; the South Student Neighborhood is nicknamed the ""ghetto"" - and its held out there.  Let's just say that I'm probably going to be stretched out on the stage before rehearsal...and if I die, well...let's just say ""Dr. Phil"" will be pissed.

Okay...so...  I've been in class for the past week and a half.  Its not too bad - I mean, other music majors complain that its a ton of work, blah blah blah, but I don't think its too bad.  As of Wednesday I'm going to be going from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. so they can't say anything.  Let's just say though that I won't be having anything resembling a social life for a bit while I adjust to this.  Ugh.

Well, classes are only half of my college life...the other is scoping out the hot guys!  ^_^  There are 3 which I have taken an interest in (*joy!*) but at least one of them has a girlfriend! (*DAMN*)  

I'm not going to explain any further right now because I have a feeling that they will eventually come across.  If you *really* want to know, just IM me!  I love random IMs - just identify yourself first!

Oh, well...I'm going to go lay down with some cool compressors...I'm getting tired just sitting here typing.  So, until next time, later!"

We do not ask for your poor, or your hungry

With every breath, we shall hunt them down
Each day, we will spill their blood, till it rains down from the skies!
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal.
These are principles that every man, of every faith can embrace!
These are not polite suggestions!
These are codes of behavior

We urge you lesser forms of filth not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption

Saw The Used...AMAZING

I hate my living situation right now. It hurts me so much to live here. I'm trying my best to be a good friend, but it's really fucking hard. Some days I feel like just running away and not looking back, but I couldn't do that, not until my bills are paid.

So I think I'm going to save up as much money as humanly possible and move with in the next 2 years. I need to get out of this state. Too many memories of what I wanted out of life that didn't happen. I need to get away and start over it feels like.

I'm glad she's happy, but at the same time I'm hurt that she's already ready to go out with him, makes me feel like shit. Well, at least the poem I wrote the other day still holds true I guess. 

To quote Taking Back Sunday ""I want to hate you so bad, but I can't""

So yea, congradulations I guess, I hope you get what you want. And if I'm being a shitty friend lately to you, I'm sorry, I'm trying my best, but it's hard, it's really fucking hard.

I think I might set up my room at my aunts soon and start staying there a few nights a week, maybe that will help. But then again, maybe it will hurt more, who knows.

This is fucking gay and I hate it. I never really wanted this. There were times I was upset and everything, but still, I wanted to be with you forever.

Just, since the whole things happened, I just found myself questioning if there is a god, and if there is, why the fuck he would let something like this happen. Like, if there is a god, and he's all loving and caring and shit, why the fuck would he let our friend die like that. I've tried the whole ""It was her time to go"" thing, but no, no one's time is 17 fucking years old NO ONE! I don't care who you are, i don't care if i hate you, no one deserves that, and on top of the whole thing, why would he let this happen and destroy all of our hearts if he loves us so much.

So yea, if any of you believe in God, i'm sorry if I pissed you off, but this is my offical Fuck You to God. I don't want your help anymore, ok. Just leave me and my friends alone, and stop fucking with us like this...

Love is not obedience, conformity, or submission. It is a counterfeit love that is contingent upon authority, punishment, or reward.

They've decided to hold back the release of the latest release from ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead due to the fact that albums will be coming out from U2, Eminem and No Doubt around the planned time of release and they don't want to overflood the market with their releases. <b>So thank you to all three people out there who currently have The Joshua Tree, The Rings of Saturn and The Eminem Show sitting in your three CD changer</b> as well as a copy of Source Tags and Codes in your car stereo, for it is because of you that come October 5th we shall have no new Trail of Dead. Shame on you, you open minded yet greedy musical devotees. The album has been left in virtual musical limbo and it's not certain exactly when it will come out.
In other Trail news the band has at least temporarily parted ways with bass player Neil Busch due to some personal medical complications, although he was able to finish recording the album, entitled Worlds Apart. </lj-cut>

Ok, I'm pretty sure more than 3 fucking people have U2, No Doubt and Eminem cds. I'm not saying Trail is a bad band, I don't like them, but still, I'm pretty fucking sure that No Doubt, U2, Eminem have all outsold Trail. How many awards have those 3 won combined? Probably over 3 dozen or so, how many has Trail be NOMINATED for? NOT EVEN ONE!!!! So, yes, thank you to all 3 people who own U2, No Doubt and Eminem, because of you, the one person that listens to And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of The Dead has to wait a week longer for their cd!"

Alrighty then, I recommend reading the philosophy of time travel (from the Donnie Darko dvd, www.donniedarko.com, OR many other sites, search google) and perhaps even completing the Donnie Darko website before or after you finish reading this. The following is as i've heard the most common theory and the one Richard Kelly (writer/director) was following. Although he left the story open for any interpretations and your own personal opinions, this one seems to put everything together. If you want to take the easy way out and simply say ""it was all a dreeeaaammm of Donnie's"" then go straight ahead. And so here it is, Donnie Darko explained (as clear as possible). 

The jet engine comes from nowhere and causes a corruption in time. It doesn't make any sense. A total screw-up in time and the universe. What's that do? It causes what is called ""The Tangent Universe"". Basically the whole film takes place in this Tangent Universe, from the moment the engine crashes into Donnie's room the first time, to the moment it crashes into it the second time. Everything happens for a reason, eh? 

In this Tangent universe, a ""Living receiver"" is randomly selected. Donnie plays the role of the living receiver. His task is to give the artifact (engine) a meaning for it's appearance. If he fails to do so, the tangent universe will collapse into itself, ending itself and the primary universe (ours). 

Just about every other character in the film (excluding Donnie, Frank and Gretchen) are what is called ""The manipulated living"". Their job is to guide Donnie to fulfill his objective. For example there's Roberta Sparrow and her book, Donnie's science teacher..etc. You can come up with examples for all of them. Examples of how they somehow helped him. 

Frank and Gretchen are what is called ""The manipulated dead"". They're called this because they, at some point, die in the Tangent Universe. Due to this, they are given the power to contact Donnie at any other time within the tangent universe, even BEFORE they die. This explains why Donnie sees Frank's ghost-like figure. Why didn't Donnie see a ghost-like figure of Gretchen? Well really, there was no need. Frank seemed to have it under control, and Gretchen was an actual friend of Donnie so she was already there for him. 

Another quick fact. As the living receiver, Donnie is gifted with special abilities. The ability to conjure fire and water (comes in handy when he's setting fire to Jim Cunningham's house, and when he's flooding the school), telekinesis (this helps when he's placing the jet engine into the hole in the ending), mind control (not sure where this was used..guess it wasn't necessary) and increased strength (the axe in the solid bronze school statue, ""The Mongrel""). There had been a shot that Richard decided to cut from the movie and DVD of Donnie elevating from the ground and slamming the axe into the statue, just so you can go with your imagination. 

Think about it people. If Donnie hadn't done just about every single thing in the film, if he hadn't listened to the manipulated, he would never have put the engine into the hole in the end. If he hadn't done this, it would have never travelled back in time and crashed into his house, giving the universe a massive ""brain-overload"", causing the universe to be destroyed. 

What else? Remember in the ending where many characters from the film are shown waking up? Well this is because after the tangent universe is over with (it was over with once Donnie sent the engine back through time), some of the manipulated will have haunting dreams and memories of their journey through it. As you can see, they all have mixed feelings about what they remember. Cherita for example, is laying quietly down with a soft smile, but then Jim Cunningham on the other hand ends up committing suicide because he remembers too much and it drives him mad (this info found on the donnie darko website). This also explains the ending scene. Gretchen feels she knows or remembers Donnie from somewhere. Both her and Donnie's mother feel it too, like they know or remember eachother from somewhere. They don't know why or how. This is why Jena Malone gives her character that amazingly acted puzzled look on her face, then a slow wave, out of instinct I guess

Does anyone care?

Cuz' in these times
When I'm <b>alone</b>,
all I have to do is summon my memory,
of what I've got
and who they are
and then I <strike>wont</strike> feel lonely

Do I show up alone or someone comes with me
It's really not that bad
But still I feel a tingling of whose gonna hurt me
I should<strike>n't</strike> be scared

"event","So everyone is at Jen's I was chilling on the couch cuz I wasn't really having that good of a time.

Some guy walks in and says his name is Papa Smurf and they let him in thinking he knew someone.
He chilled for awhile then left.
About 15 mins after he left, about 10 cops come to the house and bust up the party and they say they are looking for a guy with dreadlocks and shit (Papa Smurf)

They stay for a while and talk to us, and apperantly some of the kids at the party were at some concert with one of the cops so he was cool.

They leave, we all start to chill out, then we see lights again. We look outside and they are searching a car and have Papa Smurf.

Apperantly Papa Smurf had a shit load of drugs on him. The reason they were following him is because he was going to a call girls house nextdoor to Jen's, and picked Jen's by mistake. 

They arrested Papa Smurf and the two hookers.

Cops showed up to Jen's around 1:20ish. I left when the cops finally left from around Jen's house at 5 fucking am.

All in all, crazy fucking night"

Ok, I don't know how much longer I can do this. I've been trying so hard to make things right.
I know you just want time, and I'm doing my best to give it to you but it's hard.
Everything I have done I have been shit on for.
Everything I say your only response is ""You are a fatass. You are ugly""
You are the only one in the world that makes me feel so bad about myself, and it shouldn't be like that.
You may say its for the best, to help me lose weight or whatever, but there are better ways that making me hate myself.

And yea, you'll probably read this and get mad, but you know what? I don't care. This is the shit that is on my mind every minute of everyday. 

Me and my mom talked about how she misses seeing you, and I told her I miss seeing you too, that even tho we live together, I havn't seen you in months. I havn't seen the girl I love so much. 
I've seen a girl that has nothing but resentment for me
A girl that thinks I'm fat
A girl that thinks I'm ugly
A girl that hates me
A girl that thinks I'm worthless

Thats not what i fucking want!
I want YOU back
I want to be the one you are excited to see when you come home
I want to be the one you are sad to leave when you have to go to work
I want us to be us again

So if you read this and get mad, I'm sorry, but this is how I feel


I want you back, I still love you.

Me and Tom are driving to Ram's Horn and Tom makes a wicked turn around a corner and a cop stops us. The cop asks what the hurry is and Tom says there was a kid chasing us. The cop, with out skipping a BEAT looks right at us and says ""THAT BASTARD!"" asks us our age and tells us to be careful...it was AWESOME.

Had a good night at Hankels and Jay Morgans tonight. 

Good times, good friends, good......stuff?

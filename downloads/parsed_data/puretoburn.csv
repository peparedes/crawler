Christmas is over.
2008 is here.
And according to Kanye, Jesus still walks. Or something.

Kicked it at Brandon's party with the dream-date from hell. 

Well, it wasn't really a date. 
Although we did kinda go together. 
Although he probably didn't have anyone else to go with. 
But he did ask me. 
Maybe cos everyone else had plans. 
But he could've picked anyone. 
And he picked me. 
Maybe it's cos I went with his outfit.
Yeah, thats it.

I'm hardcore. I can play it cool like Vanilla Ice.

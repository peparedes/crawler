"event","Wow so I have done so much since I last wrote in this. The band started out in Minnesota and since then we have been through Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisana, and Texas, which is where I am now. I have met so many people so far this year and it has only been two months. I read Katie's live journals and it makes me sad because she has kept in touch with so many people from school and I haven't. Sad.

Currently, I am in Spring, Texas which is two miles outside of Houston and we are staying at this awesome church that is so amazing. It really is spectacular the kinds of youth minestry that is happening around the world. It is so hard to imagine that programs like this are possible coming from a town where a youth group of 25 is considered large. 

So I have begun to start thinking about life after team and honestly I don't know what I am going to do. Minnesota is starting to sound really good. Since Jill and Katie are the only ones who read this (if others do, leave me a comment, just for fun) I guess I am not afraid to say that Troy is thinking of going to school in Wisconsin, Arizona, or Florida and at this point I would be hard pressed not to follow him. There is just something about this guy. Interesting, if you want more information call or email. Jill I will be calling you soon so we can chat and catch up, a lot has happened since Minnesota, as you can tell.

Well, since I probably won't update for a while we head to Friendswood tomorrow and then Katy and then Pearwood (all surrounding areas od Houston) then we head up to San Antonio and hopefully Austin. By mid-November we hit Kansas on the way to Kansas City to do our huge High School Construction Zone. It is going to rock. I hope all is well with everyone and I will look forward to hearing from all two fo you that real this."

As some of you know, I have been assigned to South Central Captive Free. This is alright by me but the really sad part is that Kimmi Rupp is on my team and I have to spend the whole year with Kimmi. 

My world is falling apart. I thought quartet for a year was enough but apparently I have something more to learn from here. 

I hope all of you are having a great day!!!

Remember to write. Now, I am going to really need it."

I have a new address for the year.

Joannie Bryan: Captive Free
c/ o Youth Encounter
3490 Lexington Ave. N.
Shoreview, MN 55126


Please write, especially these next few weeks because I will be off of internet access and I hear that cell phones don't work in the camp area. 

I am trying to go for band member with the most mail. Help me out. Make me feel loved.

As for my departure, I leave Wednesday. So God's Peace all and my next update will be in a while."

"event","First of all I want to give a shout out to my homies Katie and Jon. Sorry, had to get that out. Lately the topics of my runs with my sister have been TJ bashing. We always talk in the car and then she gets mad at me because I can't think of anything to talk about when we run but one can always get into good TJ bashing babble. The topic came up after attempting to scrapbook my past three years of college and all the photos brought back memories. To keep things short, the bashing helps me to not regret any decisions I made. 

So I have been running everyday either with my sister or my aunt. Tomorrow is a morning run with my aunt and then laying out at the club and swimming in the afternoon. Today was swim in the afternoon and run tonight. I am looking forward to our run tonight, I am actually in the mood (or shall I say frame of mind to keep this out of the sexual genre). 

Katie I will be calling you later to talk about things, since I neglected to call you last week when I said I would (Although I didn't not promise). You know I really hate being that flaky friend but when it comes to phone calls I am the worst. 

Well, time to go. There is a homosexuality discussion at church tonight and I have been looking forward to it all summer. The people at my church are very conservative, so I think this is going to be interesting.

Joannie, Over and Out."

"event","So my sister graduated from high school and the other sister was confirmed this weekend. Lots of craziness in the Bryan household but things are calming down now. Today is shopping for wedding presents with a wedding tomorrow. It is strange to think that my friends are getting married already. I think I want to get married between the ages of 24 and 26 so all you available men out there. Pencil me in. 

Oliver starts in on Monday and I am sure that my journal entries will begin to be complaint files on what kind of hell I have to put up with at work. I really do hate children. 

There is this family that my dad is friends with and they live in Oregon and he is bringing one of the nine children here for a week. I think I am going to pull my hair out. The only good thing about working is that I don't have to be here with 'her'. 

Wow this is getting rather harsh and I am sounding like a bitch. Here is something nicer. I saw Thirteen Going On Thirty today and treated my mom, more of a late mother's day gift, and saw it with my sister and aunt. It was really cute and I highly recommend it to anyone. Well, that is enough typing for today. Until we meet again.

"event","So yesterday I went running twice. Yeah go me. Today I got to sleep in for the first time since I got home because my sister slept with the puppy. Having a new puppy is like having a baby except when I really need a break I can shove the little bugger out in the dog run and finally have some time to myself. He is awful cute though. 

Currently I am wearing a bathing suit and short and I am going to go sweep outside. You wouldn't think that is such a big job unless you have been here. Lots of dirt to sweep of of lots of cement. The chores have been piling up because my sister's parties are this Sunday. Cindy is promoted from 8th grade and Confirmed and then we change the napkins and Kari has her graduation party. So much to do. 

The broom calls.

"event","Well, my sister is still in school so the new puppy is sleeping with me. That means waking up at least once during the night to take him out and then getting up at about 7am. It is early but I guess I can deal. I mean there is only so long I can lay in bed and dream about 'someone' leaving his girlfriend for me. Man how pathetic am I, but I can't help it. In my eyes he is the prefect guy. If you know me then you know exactly who this is, and I know Katie you don't approve but I will see him mid-June and we'll have to see what happens. How often does a girl run into a blonde hair blue eyed tall guy who looks like a Ken doll. Only time will tell.

Well, this weekend we celebrated my Aunt Carla's 40th birthday. On Friday my mom and I were eatting lunch at Coco's and she called and wanted us to come over and we were like, ""Okay, does she want us to personally wish her a happy birthday?"" So we went over there and she just held up her hand to show us the birthday present Jack gave to her. My aunt is offically engaged. At her party on Saturday we had the SpongeBob jumpy house. It was a blast. My mom is going to try to get one for Kari's graduation party this coming weekend. 

I have begun running and working out on a regular basis. I am more in shape than I thought I was. I am already starting out the summer in better shape than I started last summer. Jameson is being a great partner in crime but I have only run around here and with Carla because Ryan is not back from school yet. He said something about a family vacation. How lame is that, I mean who goes on family vacation? 

I spent this weekend, also, auditioning kids for LTY summer program and we have a total of 29 kids so far. That is a ton. So far Oliver is not annoying me too much, just the organizational issues of the staff members are. It's alright though, I will just spend all summer making lists to compensate. 

I hope that whoever reads this is having a great day and yay for me for keeping it updated."

"event","Well, you know what they say, there is no place like home for the holidays, or summer. I have moved all my stuff from the wonderful apartments at California Lutheran University back to my little room at the homestead in Lodi. One can barely walk in my room but I am thankful that I still have a room here. 

As for news on the home front: The pincher bugs are out in full force and the cherries are being harvested so the black widows are roaming about, don't worry they are under control - for those of you worrying about visiting. We have a new puppy, Lomax. He came with a name, as they all do, so that kinda sucks. My sister graduates from high school next Friday and my sister is promoted from eighth grade on the same day. My high school drama teacher is retiring so I went by the school to talk to him, although hanging out at Lodi High was not in my plans for the summer. Tonight I am going to the senior awards banquet for Lodi High though, with my mom. She said she didn't want to sit by herself, so lucky me, I get to go and be bored with her. 

Well, I am the first of my college friends back from school, so I sit here and wait. This summer is going to be great. At least two weddings, performances, running. Just wait for all to come. Until we meet again.

"event","<p>I went to Half Price Books today to get rid of some books and DVDs. I really should have known better because each time I've done this, I leave feeling like I taken. This time I sold them a <b>ton</b> of books on web design (back when I was studying for that career path), some assorted fiction and some good DVDs (including season 1 of Lost) for $53. Having driven away, now I feel stupid for letting some of the stuff stay there. I'm really curious about their profits, must be huge! Severely under pay for everything and sell it for 10 times as much! They suck.</p><p><em><small>Posted via <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/cosysoftware_en/"">LiveJournal.app</a>.</small></em></p>"

"event","<p>I'm trying to get rid of some makeup that I has barely or not been used at all. I'm more of a collector than a user and I'm starting to realize that it's waste to have this and not use it... so why not take it off my hands? :) Some of this stuff is limited edition or discontinued so it will be hard to find.</p>  <p>I only accept PayPal and prefer non-credit card funded funds. I will only ship to US and Canada, shipping is $1.50 plus insurance if you want it. I will include delivery confirmation, except when shipping to Canada. Also, I'll give you a break if you're getting multiple things. I have feedback on MUA under <b>shesaid</b>. All items will be shipped Monday morning provided payment is received in time. I'm willing to talk on any of these items so please don't hesitate to ask. :) And thanks!</p>  <p><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dearcarla/pic/0000yzt8/""><img width=""245"" vspace=""5"" hspace=""5"" height=""240"" border=""0"" align=""left"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dearcarla/pic/0000yzt8/s320x240"" /></a> From left to right, top row to bottom row:<br /><br /> Entwined, Pink Maribu, Jest, Tortilla Tan<br /><strike> Hipster</strike>, Luv &amp; Lust, <strike>High Strung</strike>, Red Haute<br /> Enraptured, Moxie, Rich Reserve, Teddy Babe<br /> <br /> Some of these lipsticks are LE, some discontinued. <br /> All have been swatched once or twice at the most.<br /><br /> Each lipstick is $12 and I will accept bids for Moxie.</p>  <br clear=""all"" />  <p><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dearcarla/pic/000106se/""><img width=""320"" vspace=""5"" hspace=""5"" height=""213"" border=""0"" align=""left"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dearcarla/pic/000106se/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a> From left to right, top row to bottom row:<br /><br /> Dusty Coral, <strike>Acid Orange, Primary Yellow</strike> <br /> Cool Pink, Pink Vivid, True Chartreuse <br /><br />  These are full sized Pro pigments and all of them have only been swatched so there is 99.9% of product left. <br /><br />  Each pigment is $17.50 and I'll accept bids on Pink Vivid, this color is no longer available.</p>  <br clear=""all"" />  <p><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dearcarla/pic/000119ge/""><img width=""320"" vspace=""5"" hspace=""5"" height=""149"" border=""0"" align=""left"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dearcarla/pic/000119ge/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a>From left to right:<br /><br /> Vellum eyeshadow, Pearl CCB, Slick CCB and Flighty CCB<br /><br />The Vellum eyeshadow is quite old (as you can see, it's the size of the CCB's) but it's still good.

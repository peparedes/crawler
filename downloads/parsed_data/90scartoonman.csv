"event","October 1st already?  Wow, what a busy summer.  And it will be an even busier fall (especially with TV back now...yes, that plays a part in things).  So, it's with a heavy heart that I'm going to have to say so long to LiveJournal.

We've had some laughs, we've killed some time, but now that time has passed.

I'm going to be wrapping a few things up over the next week or so, but then that's it.  I may pop my head back in every now and then, but don't hold me to that.  If you want to friend me on other social media venues that don't suck me in for hours at a time (Facebook, Twitter), you can PM me.

Man...it's been a trip and a half!"

"event","In preparation of the new Cinderella live action movie, which I'll be watching tonight, I decided to watch a bunch of different versions of the story.  I also read the Charles Perrault version and the Brothers Grimm one.  So I figured I'd write down my thoughts on various additions/subtractions and what I liked and didn't like.

I marathoned the entire Disney Cinderella trilogy...which is weird because I still haven't done that for the Aladdin or Little Mermaid movies.

Obvious spoilers for the classic Cinderella story, but more specific spoilers to be ware of include the Disney sequels, Happily N'Ever After, Into the Woods (the 2015 version) and Once Upon a Time in Wonderland.

<lj-cut>

I'll preface this by saying many cultures (some that date back thousands of years, like the Egyptian and Chinese ones) have their own Cinderella stories.  But here are the two that are most commonly adapted and known today:

Charles Perrault's Cinderella's dated at 1697.  This is the version with the fairy godmother who turns mice, lizards, a rat, and a pumpkin into Cinderella's transport and gives her a dress and glass slippers.  While the stepsisters are mean, the younger one is nicer and calls her ""Cinderella"" rather than ""Cinderwench"", and Cinderella forgives them, marrying them off to dukes after she gets her happy ending.

The Brothers Grimm version I found is given the date to be 1812 (over a hundred years after Perrault!) and Cinderella's biological father is alive and more active, but it's her recently deceased mother who is important.  Cinderella plants a tree at her grave and makes wishes to a bird.  This is how she gets her dress and golden slippers.  In this version, she can't go to the ball because her stepmother gives her all these chores, and she runs not because magic runs out at midnight but because she is too embarrassed to tell the prince who she really is.  The prince catches her by laying down pitch on the steps when she runs (but only holds on to one of her slippers).  The ending is meaner to the stepsisters, as they cut off parts of their feet to fit the shoe (and the prince finds out, then he fits Cinderella) and has birds peck out their eyes.

So going in order...

Walt Disney's Cinderella (1950), Dreams Come True (2002), A Twist in Time (2007) - Ilene Woods/Jennifer Hale
-This one elevates the mice to supporting characters.  Jaq and Gus Gus are fun, but there's a little too much cat and mouse in this and not enough Prince characterization.  I like Cinderella herself, helping to define what it means to be a Disney princess with her optimism, kindness, and singing/talking to animals.  Here, the Fairy Godmother appears to Cinderella at her lowest moment (they meet for the first time).  The ball is shortened, and one dance is all it takes to get them to fall in love (she doesn't realize he's the prince).  A simple story, but with a classic feel.  Dreams Come True is stupid, but I like Cinderella having a rough transition from a maid to a princess, and it does redeem Anastasia and matches her up with a baker (!).  Twist In Time actually undoes that but still makes Anastasia sympathetic and gives the prince more of a personality.  I like how Anastasia is based on Perrault's younger stepsister, it makes me appreciate her as the Red Queen in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland even more.  As far as cheapquels go, A Twist in Time ain't bad.

Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1957) - Julie Andrews
-Kind of short, but that's what happens when you put a play on TV in the 50's.  Julie Andrews is great, and what's interesting about this one is that Cinderella knows her godmother but doesn't know she has fairy powers, and she is summoned because of Cinderella's wishing.  Also, the King and Queen have different ideas of what they want for Prince Superlongname.  I like how the Prince questions if he loves Cinderella or is just infatuated with her and she is so afraid that it's a dream she isn't sure she can tell him who she is or where she came from or it'll all come crashing down on her.  The only other musical Cinderella on this list, I like the songs better than the ones in the Disney version.  The ending is a little abrupt, she's just kind of there when the Prince needs to fit the shoe.

Shelley DuVall's Faerie Tale Theatre (1985) - Jennifer Beals
-More of an episode than a movie since it's under an hour long, but it's very faithful to the beats of the Charles Perrault story.  Cinderella is very sympathetic here, even considerate about her stepsisters.  She never met her fairy godmother before, and the fairy godmother wasn't aware of the stepfamily's treatment of Cinderella.  She wanted to turn them into animals (and does at the end, although they will return to human at midnight).  Fairy godmother is more of a jokester here.  Jennifer Beals is Cinderella and Matthew Broderick is Prince Henry, and they are really sweet together.  The ball is more of a celebration of autumn than anything, the prince isn't looking for someone nor do his parents force that on him, but his connection to Cinderella is so great.  He throws the ball on the second evening is just so he can see Cinderella again.

Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics (1987) - ?
-Animated and Japanese, but I watched the dub (with English actors who don't take breaths).  It's actually about the same length as the Shelley DuVall one.  This version is based on the Grimm Brothers Cinderella (which is a given considering the name of the series).  Nothing about the deceased mother, but there is a magic tree that provides for her and birds that give her advice.  In this version, the prince doesn't know how to dance and Cinderella teaches him, not knowing who he is but falling in love with him in the process.  When she finds out, she is nervous about revealing who she is, but once he has her slipper and calls women to the castle, she wants to tell him who she is.  However, she is locked up by her stepmother, who has a Woodsman cut down the magic tree (!).  The birds help her escape and, when the prince sees her being carried to him by birds and with a dress, he knows who she is.  Naturally, the slipper fits.  The fate of the stepfamily remains a mystery.

Happily N'Ever After (2006) - Sarah Michelle Gellar
-Feature length animated movie.  More of a Shrek-style deconstructional parody, as there are magic beings watching classic fairy tales and Cinderella's stepmother hijacks the tales and magically warps everything.  The initial story before all the warping is kind of barebones Perrault with fairy godmother and all.  The Prince is stupid, though.  REALLY stupid. Least likeable prince ever! Probably so Cinderella ends up with Rick, the prince's servant.  I wasn't a huge fan of the movie, and it doesn't add too much to what I've already seen of the story.

Once Upon A Time (2011) - Jessy Schram
-During the first season of the show, there is a Cinderella episode.  We don't see the actual Cinderella story play out, just Rumpelstiltskin vaporizing the fairy godmother and giving Cinderella what she needs for the ball in exchange for a deal.  You can kind of assume it plays out the way the Disney version does (and, as mentioned, Anastasia finds herself in Wonderland).  Fastforward and you learn Rumpel wants Cinderella's baby!  First time I've seen a child involved in the story (a girl who is named Alexandra), and I like how they contrast how adult Cinderella and the prince are in fairy tale land whereas in Storybrooke, 19 may be too young to start a family.

Into the Woods (1986, 2015) - Anna Kendrick
-I've listened to the soundtrack from the 80's, so I'm counting that, but I'm mostly talking about the 2015 movie.  Another Grimm version, this one had the tree blessed by the spirit of her deceased mother, gold slippers, and birds that like pecking out eyes.  Into the Woods is mostly about a Baker and his Wife and only intersect with Cinderella's story here and there.  There is a three night ball and Cinderella gets trapped in pitch and ends up with the Prince...but then the story continues.  The Prince reveals his wishy-washy and kind of lecherous nature (the 2015 movie cuts out his Agony reprise, but him kissing the Baker's Wife is still in it), and Cinderella realizes she got married too fast.  She ends up living a more common life, which I kind of like because it is being played as being true to who she has always been, working rather than wishing.  Probably best deconstruction of the story I've seen.

Other Versions - Didn't have time to re-watch Ever After with Drew Barrymore or the Rodgers and Hammerstein remake with Brandy, but I enjoyed both of those.  Cinderella appears in the 10th Kingdom miniseries (hundreds of years after her story has ended) played by Ann-Margaret, the comic book Fables where she is the Mundy world's greatest spy, and Shrek 3: Forever After played by Amy Sedaris along with other fairy tale princesses.  They are all fun in their own way but hardly the most important character of each work (although, admittedly, I still haven't read the Fables Cinderella minis).

Conclusion - There are so many differences and variations from story to story, and that's what I like about the story.  The fairy godmother's personality and situation can change, the stepfamily can be mean and repent or they can be evil the whole way through.  There's always a case of mistaken identity.  Sometimes Cinderella doesn't know the prince is the prince, sometimes her stepfamily doesn't recognize her at the ball (other times they just don't see her), and her identity and backstory is revealed at different times.  As for her name, it's interesting because ""Cinderella"" is supposed to be a way to mock her for spending all her time in the ashes and cinders of the fire.  But what is her real name?  Some versions use ""Ella"", but the original stories aren't any help.  The Grimm version even has her own father call her Cinderella!  It's crazy, but those are fairy tales for you.

There are a lot of common themes in the stories, even the deconstructions, but there is plenty of magic, true love, and things working out in the end.  Once Upon A Time suggests that Cinderella is an inspiration because she proves that anyone can make a change for the better in life.  I like that optimism and being a good person pays off for her.  Here's hoping I enjoy the new version too!"

In addition to my regular job I had some freelance work to do, which went well, but man, TV is unrelenting.  It's bad enough I couldn't finish Doctor Who and the spin-offs over the summer, it's bad enough I'm trying to read the Twilight Saga and then watch the movies, but Time Warner changed all its stations and I had to re-program my DVR but I'm not sure I set up the series recordings correctly.  So it's a day to day struggle.  I taped the final Beware the Batman episodes but will watch one per week along with a new episode of Gotham.  At least my DVR picks up new shows like that.

I go back and forth between completely giving up on all social media like LJ/Facebook/Twitter, but that seems a little drastic.  It's been weeks since I could catch up, I've missed updates and burpdays and the like, but...like I said, I'm hanging in there.  Still here."

Anyway, this is going to be a bit lengthy and have pictures, so here's a cut...

<lj-cut>

Opting to work and make money on Thursday and Friday, I only decided to do Comic Con Saturday and Sunday.  So Saturday morning, I picked up my friend Jen and drove down to San Diego, where I had already paid for a parking spot.

Jen already had her badge, but I had to get my special presenter badge, which was cool.  We separated and I met my friend Clarence.  The Once Upon A Time line was too long (despite it being an hour before the panel), so I went to Marvel Animation.  Saw a new Ultimate Spider-Man episode, which was cool, and despite the fact that I'm not thrilled about Marvel cartoons at the moment, I still enjoyed it.  Fred Tatasciore was there to answer questions as the Hulk.  My favorite was when someone asked who his favorite/least favorite Avenger was.  He said least favorite was Hawkeye and favorite, despite respecting Black Widow, was Thor and he considers Thor his best friend.  We also saw an animated Guardians of the Galaxy sneak peak.

After that, Clarence and I went to the 20th anniversary of Gargoyles panel and a writing panel until we had to go to the film festival for the screening of our film and our panel (and Jen joined in the audience).  As you can see here:

<img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/90scartoonman/8871881/1676/1676_300.jpg"" alt=""WP_20140726_008"" title=""WP_20140726_008"">

It was a LOT of fun.  I mean, Clarence was the director so he fielded most questions, but as the co-writer I chimed in a bit.

After that, I had to run ALL the way to the Hilton (on the other side from the convention center as the Marriott, where the film festival was) to do some Boxtroll interviews for Toon Zone.  I talked to the cast (Isaac Hempstead Wright, Elle Fanning, and Ben Kingsley) and crew (the two directors and Laika president/CEO).  Tiring but exciting!

Then I walked the floor just to decompress while Jen went to the Salem panel.  I met up with her afterwards and then we met some other friends and briefly went to a WGA mixer.  It was kind of late, so some of us had a brief dinner.  Jen and I had a hotel room that wasn't exactly close to the convention center, but I had my car so it was easy to get to.  And it was only one night.

Sunday morning, I considered going to the film festival award ceremony, but I didn't want to rush anything.  Me and Jen drove back to the spot and then had some Starbucks to start our day.

We saw some of the outside Con stuff, like the Sleepy Hollow section, where the Headless Horseman attacked me.

<img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/90scartoonman/8871881/1985/1985_300.jpg"" alt=""V__7708"" title=""V__7708"">

Some of our other friends were waiting for this Constantine thing, and I got to talk to a guy they had playing him (he was funny).  Jen stayed with them and I went on to the Batman For All Seasons panel, which featured people who worked on many different Batman projects like producer of the Batman movies Michael Uslan as well as James Tucker, Brandon Vietti, and Greg Weisman.  It was a PURE BATFAN FANTASY panel and I loved it!

They opened it up to questions and said everyone who asked a question would get a DVD and the best question would get a Batman 75th anniversary hat, so I lined up for it.  The guy in front of me asked if we'd ever get a Batman Musical, which everyone laughed at, and James Tucker was all ""I hope you mean live action because I gave you one on Batman: The Brave and the Bold!""  That guy ended up winning the hat.  Michael Uslan had said that while watching the 60's Batman show he was dismayed at how campy it was and made a vow as a child to bring a more serious Batman to the general public.  I thanked him for fulfilling his vow and asked him what's the most obscure bit of Batman Trivia he knows, and he related a story about knowing that the giant penny in the Batcave is dated 1947.  The moderator gave me a DVD and told me I would've won the hat.  Ah well, it's the thought that counts.

Clarence told me he and his girlfriend had already left to go back to LA, so I joined some other friends (who were waiting in line for Hall H all Friday night and in Hall H all Saturday) on the floor and then outside for the Simpsons Dome Experience.  We got to go inside Homer's Head!

<img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/90scartoonman/8871881/2134/2134_300.jpg"" alt=""WP_20140727_012"" title=""WP_20140727_012"">

It was actually just an ad for that crazy marathon showing all Simpsons episodes and the Simpsons app, but it was still fun and we got a ""survival kit"" of granola bars, slim jims, water, etc.

That was pretty much it for me.  I found Jen and we drove back to LA.  It all happened really fast, and it was so much fun and I did a LOT that even now it kind of seems like a distant memory.  But well worth it!"

However, I am still trying to save money.  I'm not going to Comic Con for the whole time because I'm still working Thursday and Friday. Also, I have a parking spot for both Saturday and Sunday but...no actual hotel.  Eh, I'll wing it!

April was a lot of catching up for me.  I mean, I needed to get my eating right, I needed to work out again, and I needed to catch up on TV.

There was a lot of TV to watch, sheesh!  Glad I was able to watch the Agents of SHIELD and Captain America: The Winter soldier in the proper order.  So impressed they were able to do that and all within one week!

Also got to the theatre to see X-Men: Days of Future Past.  SO GOOD!  Amazing Spider-Man I'm still refusing to pay money for.  Wow, well, I've caught up on TV and season finales have aired.  Will try to get to theatres for Maleficent and How To Train Your Dragon 2.  Other than that, I don't have a lot of summer plans...try not to spend too much money!

"event","Posted in response to what <lj user=""mattzimmer""> did a while back.  I had to ask myself what my top 30 Fandoms of all time are, and I think I've settled on something reasonably accurate.

There is some overlap, such as the Marvel and DC stuff and then their universes in other mediums, but that's just kind of how it goes.

<lj-cut>

1. The Marvel Universe - The first time I really got into something that wasn't a kid show to sell toys.  My first Marvel Comic was Spectacular Spider-Man #199 (1993) and it featured a team-up between Spider-Man and the X-Men.  I thought it was awesome and loved exploring every tiny corner of it.  Huge fan of Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, X-Men, Daredevil, etc.

2. The DC Universe - I discovered DC after Marvel.  While I read the Green Lantern portions of some Action Comics I got once, my first real journey was in 1996 when I read JLA: Year One, JLA, and The Flash.  I was a huge Flash fan from the start, got into Green Lantern, and of course Batman and Superman and Justice League.

3. The Buffyverse - Still my favorite television franchise of all time.  Such a great concept, amazing characters, and crazy twists and turns along the way.

4. The Simpsons/Futurama - I decided to group them together since they're comedies.  And what comedies!  I quote the show so often sometimes I  do it without even realizing what I'm referencing.

5. The DCAU - I maintain that the DCAU is the greatest adaptation of a source material ever.  And the fact that it churned out new material for about 15 years actually makes it just as valid as any period in the DC comics Universe (which tends to restart every 10-20 years our time).  Batman the Animated Series, Superman the Animated Series, Batman Beyond, Justice League and everything else...it was a thing of beauty that will take a LOT to top, if it ever happens.

6. Disney Animated Canon - Here I'm just talking about the 50+ movies, although I will include House of Mouse and Kingdom Hearts.  My three favorite Disney movies are The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Hercules, and while I don't love every single movie (still working on the ones I haven't seen yet), they are tied together enough that I get excited when I think about them.

7. Vertigo Comics - Not exactly the DC Universe, but with Vertigo's storytelling, I feel like these are the best comic books have to offer.  While I haven't read every Vertigo title, Sandman, House of Mystery, The Unwritten, and everything related to Fables remain favorites.

8. Hercules/Xena - Not as great as the Buffyverse, of course, but I loved both Hercules and Xena at the time.  I was in high school and it sort of felt like my real transition into hour long dramas.  Yes, it was cheesy, but it felt adult, and oddly enough, I still hold up shows I watch today to the level of excitement I felt back then.

9. The Marvel Cinematic Universe - It still feels young to me, but wow, I'm really blown away by what the first Iron Man movie did and how it spawned an amazing universe that is deep, fun, captures the spirit of the comics, and really does live up to the hype.

10. Gargoyles - I maintain that Gargoyles is the greatest animated series based on an original idea.  It didn't talk down to the audience and Greg Weisman put a LOT of thought into characters and timelines and was able to incorporate so much mythology into it.  A true thing of beauty.

11. ReBoot - Second favorite original animated series.  I loved ReBoot as a kid, and thanks to its long production time, those 4 seasons lasted pretty much the entirety of the 90's and my enthusiasm lasted the whole time.  Such a cool show, and things CHANGED over the course of the series (I'm still shocked at what they did with Enzo Matrix).  Too bad it ended on a cliffhanger.

12. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Yeah, I was obsessed with it when I was a kid.  Cartoon, toys, video games...hard to top that.

13. Disney Princess - Going off on my Disney movie love, I absolutely love the Disney Princesses.  The Little Mermaid is my favorite, but Ariel really is a gateway princess, and I ended up really getting into the franchise (Jasmine is my solid second favorite, but my third tends to change between Belle, Mulan, Tiana, and some of the others depending).  Luckily, as an adult male, I am immune to most of the merchandising, but wow.  I don't care what anyone says, the magic and sheer optimism this franchise is bursting with makes me genuinely feel good about everything.

14. Final Fantasy - My favorite video game series of all time.  I've only played VII-X (and Kingdom Hearts, which had some crossover characters), and I logged in a lot of hours in that series.  My favorite video game series because I loved the stories, gameplay, and mythology.

15. Harry Potter - Favorite book series.  I love the magic, the fantasy, and the fact that the characters grow and develop consistently.

16. The Avatarverse - Sadly since I watched this as an adult, it's going to have to be a solid third to Gargoyles and ReBoot.  However, Avatar the Last Airbender tops those shows in one respect because it has a solid beginning, middle, and end.  It's got a cool concept, characters that grow, and a definitive ending.  Plus Legend of Korra is a great spinoff and actually tells you what happened to the major characters of the previous series (being set 65 years or so after A:TLA).

17. Star Trek - Star Trek is THE TV franchise.  It may not be my favorite, but I appreciate the pop cultural icon status, the concepts it introduced, and the people it inspired.  Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine are still two of the greatest hour longs I've ever seen.  And despite the fact that it's a TV franchise, it's also one of the better movie series of all times (going by a ""best of"" standard).

18. Pixar - Probably the best hit-to-miss ratio of any movie studio I've regularly followed.  Pixar movies are MUST SEE for me.  They manage to include something in their movies for every single demographic, and that I can respect.  Plus they know how to tug at the heart-strings.

19. The Disney Afternoon - Another kid fandom that I have to put on my list just because of how excited I would get to come home from school and watch the Disney Afternoon.  Favorites include DuckTales, Darkwing Duck and TaleSpin.

20. The 90s Marvel Universe - Although you can find contradictions if you look hard enough, basically, X-Men, Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Iron Man, and Hulk are all in a shared universe.  And it's low budget, cheesy, doesn't hold up to modern day standards, but I love it all the same.  A case can be made that Spider-Man Unlimited is included, but Silver Surfer and Avengers United They Stand are certainly not.

21. Nicktoons - Another thing I've been a fan of since childhood.  Since Doug, Rugrats, and Ren and Stimpy.  I separated Avatar out from that despite the fact that it's technically a NickToon.  For me, NickToons are those classic comedies that I still think about and quote.

22. Transformers - Yeah, I was really into Transformers in the 80's.  REALLY into them.

23. Dreamworks Animation - While I may love Disney and Pixar, I have to acknowledge the awesomeness that is Dreamworks.  Most notably Shrek and How to Train Your Dragon.  Dreamworks isn't exactly a must see for me, but I still love their movies.

24. Lost - I don't care what anyone says, Lost EARNED its finale.  While I don't enjoy every individual episode as much as, say, Buffy, and the franchise isn't as spectacular as Star Trek, it managed to be one of the most satisfying series of all time.

25. Ultimate Marvel - I'm separating this from the mainstream 616 Marvel Universe.  Ultimatum was horrible and killed a lot of excitement I had for it, but everything previously was golden.  The Ultimate Marvel Comics were the best updating/reimagining I've ever seen, and Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley's Ultimate Spider-Man run (which broke the record of the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby Fantastic Four run) is one of my favorite runs of all time on any comic book series.

26. Pokemon - Shut up, that game was GOOD!  So many different characters and powers.  I really got into it and enjoyed the show as well.  But only for about two years or so then I just stopped following it.

27. Goosebumps - Another book series I absolutely loved.  I used to eagerly await every new Goosebumps book and read it cover to cover, sometimes reading it again knowing what the ending was because it was a whole new experience.  To this day, I've read more books by R.L. Stine (somewhere in the neighborhood of 50) than any other author.

28. Toonami - I feel like this programming block really got its audience.  It's very engaging and fan-friendly.  It introduced me to a lot of anime and new programs.  Favorite shows include Dragonball Z, Gundam Wing, Naruto, and the Tenchi shows.

29. The Walking Dead - I admit to not reading the comic book series (although I have read the first issue), but the TV show is just so cinematic.  I love the fact that aside from two or three characters, anyone can die.  And The Talking Dead shows just how strong the fandom is.

30.  The Oz Books - There's a reason these books are classics and the Wizard of Oz is so fondly remembered.  These ARE American Fairy Tales, and they are spectacular.  I've only read the first four books in the Oz series, but I do have the complete collection downloaded to my iPad, and I am eager to work my way through them.

Honorable Mentions - Star Wars, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Hunger Games, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, still new to Doctor Who, and Fairy Tales in general"

<lj-cut>

I had a pretty interesting Christmas.  My dad flew into LA and stayed with me for a couple days until we drove out to Las Vegas.  It was my second time making the drive and my fourth time there.  Driving through the desert's kind of boring, but at least I had Christmas music and the Frozen soundtrack.

We ended up staying at the Mandalay Bay, a great place.  My sister flew into Vegas later that evening.  Unfortunately, it turned out that Krampus had messed with the luggage of that flight and her bags didn't even leave New Jersey.

We tried not to let that ruin things, though.  Even if my sister had to buy some new clothes.  In the meantime, we took some tours, saw some sights, ate good food, etc.  My sister's bags came eventually...two days later.

I suggested we go to Madam Tussaud's Wax Museum in the Venetian.  Seeing all the displays was cool and all, but I really wanted to go to see the Marvel 4D Show.  Outside the place they had wax figures of Tony Stark, Iron Man, Nick Fury, and Captain America.  The show was a lot of fun, even if the plot was kinda basic.  Dr. Doom wants to steal Tony Stark's energy source, so Iron Man, Spider-Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor have to fight off him and his Doombots, but Loki comes in and causes further trouble.  4D meant there was a sensory experience.  Blasts of air were shot into the audience, and when Loki summoned a Frost Giant, a minty smell filled the room.  It was a lot of fun.

We also ended up seeing a Cirque du Soleil Show called Zarkana.  It was about a ringmaster in an abandoned theatre with a bunch of freaks.  It was pretty amazing seeing some of the stunts they performed (I was a little worried about the guys jump-roping on a tightrope), and the clowns were funny.

We were able to order a small Christmas tree and set it up in the hotel rooms.  As a gift, my sister gave my father and I some chips to gamble with.  I'm not much of a gambler, but I figured hey, why not?  My sister learned the fine art of Craps and I joined in, although being at that table was intimidating.  I made some low risk bets and ended up coming out on top.  However, I lost pretty big when it came to Roulette.  Guess my lucky numbers weren't so lucky.  I did want to play some slots, though.  There was a Dark Knight slot machine and an Iron Man one.  I wanted to do one of those, but they were pretty crowded.  So instead, I went to this cheap looking Alice in Wonderland penny slot.  Somehow I kept hitting the bonus game and kept picking the right boxes, so I ended up winning $40.  Crazy, so I just quit while I was ahead.

Christmas went quickly.  The day after, I had to take my sister and my father to the Las Vegas airport so they could fly out, and then I drove myself back to Los Angeles.

Even though I got some more days off for New Years, it was pretty low key.  I just spend the holiday with a friend and her visiting family.  And also rested up for work.  Looks like 2014 is going to be a busy year for me.  I hope everyone's New Year is off to a great start!"

"event","Here's a (kinda) brief rundown of how I spend my Comic Con.  Also with pictures, there will be pictures (well, two):

<lj-cut>

Drove down to San Diego Thursday morning, got the two day badges I managed to snag, and hung around a bit until I went to The Pitching Hour, a panel about pitching ideas.  Met up with my friends who drove separately, and then we went to different panels.  Next for me was The Writer's Journey, another writing panel, but this one with Max from Living Single (odd).

Next was the John DiMaggio-hosted I Know That Voice about the voice actor documentary with loads of VAs on the panel (including Rob Paulsen, who sang the first bit of ""Countries of the World"" when a fan asked).  Andrea Romano and Pendleton Ward were there too.  Looks like a great doc, I can't wait until it comes out!  When they find a distributor.

The last thing I did was the first look at DC's Necessary Evil, the doc about their super villains.  It looked cool, and I liked hearing the panel discuss their villains, including Geoff Johns and his insistence Sinestro isn't really a villain.  Kinda sad no one talked about Deathstroke, though.  Also kind of freaked out by this female psychologist they had who sounded a little too much like Harley Quinn.  She says she's so fascinated by the Joker she thinks about him all the time.

Met my friends for dinner at a mall near the hotel, checked into the hotel, and went to bed.  Woke up Friday morning, had breakfast with my friends, and then I was off to entertain myself for the first day I didn't have a badge.  It wasn't bad, got to see the giant Teen Titans balloons at Lawn Con, got an Adventure Time necklace from Cartoon Network's Free Store, played the new Legend of Zelda and Sonic the Hedgehog games, and took this picture at the Grimm spice shop:

I got free 5 Hour Energy, coffee shot, and Pac Man frozen power pellet drink, so I was a little wired.

I also went to check out Disney Infinity, this crazy massive game where you can be many different Disney characters and go on different missions and build stuff with their toybox.  I played as Violet in the Incredibles one.  Not sure if I want to buy the game now, as I have little time, and they seem to just have Incrediles, Cars, Pirates of the Carribean, Monsters University, and a few others to start with.  Ended up returning to the hotel and slept.

Saturday, another badge-less day, but having a better feel for the outside Con stuff allowed me to wander to other areas.  Played more video games, like Mickey Mouse Illusions or whatever it's called, checked out the cool stuff at Nerd HQ, and waited in line to take this picture:

<img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/90scartoonman/8871881/679/679_900.jpg"" alt=""9297.pip_9297_0334"" title=""9297.pip_9297_0334"" width=""400"" height=""600"" />

Ha, I love it!  I also saw Silas Weir Mitchell hanging outside the Grimm spice shop.  I checked out some of Geek and Sundry's new movie (Felicia Day was at this bar), but I left to wait in line for Disney Infinity again.  They had people doing sketches of any Disney character there, so I had an evil scheme to get a Melody sketch.  Unfortunately, after waiting for that, the guy couldn't do Melody from memory and no one could get internet on the phone, so I just had him draw me Ariel.

Following that I went to a Writers Guild and Video Game Guild drinks and schmooze thing.  I got to talk to Stan Berkowitz (DCAU) and Tom Tataranowicz (MCAU)!  Yay!

Back to the hotel, bed, final breakfast, check out of the hotel, and to the Con just in time to not get into DuckTales: Remastered.  I caught the tail end of Scooby Doo (it's hilarious seeing kids ask questions) so I could stay for the Cartoon Voices panel, which I always love going to.  After that, I went to Beware the Batman.  Great to hear the producers and actors talk about the show, but I don't know why they showed the Humpty Dumpty episode, which is the fifth one, on a series that has some continuity.  Nearly made it into 25 Years of the Disney Afternoon, they like, JUST ran out of space and closed the door right before I could get in.  Rats!

I spent the rest of the Con on the floor.  The second part of my Melody scheme didn't even pay off.  This one booth had the Teen Titans VAs signing autographs, and I wanted Tara Strong to autograph my Melody picture, but she couldn't make it for whatever reason.  I debated getting Scott Menville or Khary Payton's autographs, but I ended up passing.  I did, instead, end up buying two X-Men trades, Revolution (which just came out) and the Dark Phoenix Saga (a new 30th anniversary trade) and Amazing Spider-Man #700.  Although I stopped reading ASM a year or two ago, eh, a milestone's a milestone.

After 5, everything shut down, and it was time to leave...ah Comic Con, how I love thee."

"event","Finally I get around to updating...yeesh.  Anyway, my 2013's been going fairly well, although it has had its ups and downs.  Here's what's going on with me:

<lj-cut>

Career-wise, I'm still working that mailroom job I got in September, regular overtime hours, so it's keeping me afloat.  It's been a little over a year since I've graduated.  My thesis screenplay has been submitted to a couple contests and has gotten a somewhat positive response (and went to a festival last month where I was featured).  Juggling other writing projects, too, but in terms of stuff that I'm trying to get made, a friend of mine and I are tossing around a web series idea.  Also, I found an animator to do a little bit of animation for me, which is cool, she's working on the character designs now.

Social Life-wise, things have been okay.  It was easier to stay in constant contact with everyone while we were still in school, but we've kind of gone our separate ways, and some have left LA.  A Canadian friend of mine's visa is up and he has to go back to Canada by the end of the month, unfortunately.  My roommate and his girlfriend are crazy and sometimes drive me crazy, but I haven't killed them yet, so that's something.  I am happy that there are a few friends I have that I do see on a regular basis, that means we'll remain friends.

In terms of other activities, not a whole not has happened these last few months.  Been trying to work as much as I can, so I haven't taken any days off.  I did end up going to WonderCon for one day back in March.  A lot of fun, I got to see the Teen Titans Go and Under the Dome panels, two shows I'm looking forward to.  Also The Pacific Rim panel with Guillermo Del Toro, who is hilarious and you know had a blast making the movie.

Comic Con is next month, can't believe it's that time already.  Unfortunately, I only have tickets for Thursday and Sunday, but I'll make the most out of it.

May do a movie/TV update, but I will say I saw Much Ado About Nothing and LOVED IT!  Man, it's been nine years since ""A Hole in the World"", but hey, Joss can still get great performances out of Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof."

And also time to Netflix!  Okay, I guess this means I'm prime for watching some Dcotor Who.  Uh...what exactly was the watching order of that again?  I get confused easily..."

So, I turned 30 yesterday.

It wasn't bad, actually.  I had to go to work, but afterwards, I went to Torrance High...they filmed parts of Buffy the Vampire Slayer there!  I got to see the courtyard!  Afterwards, I went over to the Melting Pot to meet some friends for fondue.  Both cheese and chocolate...and they bought me a cake!  It was all very delicious.

I don't really feel older, it's just weird to say I'm in my 30's now.  Crazy."

"event","Yeesh, September just flew by, didn't it?  I haven't even told you guys what I've been doing!  So my summer job at the school library ended at the end of August, and, luckily for me, I found a regular full-time job about a week later.

I started the week after Labor Day, actually.  I'm a mail sorter at an insurance tracking agency in Long Beach.  Not the most glamorous or exciting job, but I'm okay with the experience I'm getting, the commute is great (20 miles is far and gas is expensive, but it's going the other way traffic is going and I get there quickly) and the hours are very doable.  To reward myself, I pre-ordered the Avengers and Cinderella DVD's.  Those came with free lithographs...sweet!

Outside of that, I got a GroupOn for Gold's Gym.  A three month membership for $50, which is great, so I've been going there about three times a week.  I also helped my friend write his thesis film, and he's been filming the last two weeks.  He actually had me come in to do a few cameos, which was a lot of fun, even if it was draining and time consuming.

Today is Jodi Benson's birthday, and mine is next week.  I'm looking forward to it, hopefully poking around Torrance High (where some Buffy exteriors were shot), going for fondue, and perhaps to Knott's Berry Farms.

Plus a few other exciting things I'll talk about as they happen...hopefully."

This may get a BIT spoilerific, but only in the sense that I saw an overlong commercial for them (I know who the alien bad is on Young Justice but won't spoil that).  Anyway, info below the cut:

<lj-cut>


Kevin Smith was the surprise moderator, and although I love his enthusiasm for all this (it's funny he said the people who are working on Beware the Batman are ""doing God's work""), should they really have had such a pottymouth moderate a panel with lots of kids in attendance?  Ah well.


DC Nation Shorts: Looks like we're getting some more cool shorts.  I'm glad they are coming out with action-oriented ones, but I have to geek out over the comedic one...Justice League of Animals (not Justa Lotta Animals?)!!!  Diedrich Bader as Batmongoose!  I was going to ask the panel if we were going to get more Batman: The Brave and the Bold shorts, but the line was too long and I was too far away.


New Teen Titans: Hm, considering the shift in the creative team, I'm not holding out any hope for plotlines from the old show being picked up, and if they are, it'll just be for gags (like the recent Red X short).  I'm going to keep an open mind about the series, and I'm hoping it's popularity will give us a Super Best Friends Forever show.


Green Lantern: More Green Lanterns!  I thought season one was solid, but the problem was, we didn't get to see enough of the Green Lantern Corps (only Hal, Kilowog, Salaak, and Mogo).  It looks like they're changing that now.  Tomar Re!  Another Earth Lantern!  And a certain small and fuzzy Lantern!


Young Justice: I'm not going to spoil what I saw, but I'll say this - whatever happened in the Teen Titans cartoon will NOT keep Young Justice from using those characters.  We already know because Beast Boy is on the show, but there is more to come!


Beware the Batman: I was unsure of this show at first, but now I'm looking forward to it.  We got to see a lot of the set and equipment design as well as the new characters.  And oooooh, man the new characters!  Katana is a weird choice over a Robin or a Batgirl, but she'll be there, Metamorpho will make an appearance, so maybe there will be Outsiders?  And Grant Morrison villains!  Professor Pyg and Mr. Toad!  I never thought I'd see a Batman character whose first appearance I own appear on TV (not counting the cameos in Batman: The Brave and the Bold).  They said they're going to focus more on Batman being a detective, so that's another thing I'm curious about.


Long story short, I'm really excited about the new DC Nation stuff!"

"event","Yeah, I know I'm like a month late with this.  Leave me alone.  Here's a recap of how Comic Con went down for me this year.

<lj-cut>

I drove down to San Diego Thursday morning with my roommate Howard, and we parked near our hotel, then took the train to the convention center.  We picked up our badges, and I did:

Hotel Transylvania - Looks like a cool movie, and I love seeing Genndy Tartakovsky's fans.  I did a write-up for Toon Zone here:
http://www.toonzone.net/2012/07/sdcc2012-the-hotel-transylvania-panel-report/#.UCc1LKNRpRE

Marvel The Next Big Thing - It sucks that I'm not as caught up on comics as I'd like to be, but it's cool I got to see what Marvel's planning, especially with X-Factor, which I'm a huge fan of.  They also talked about the new Gambit and Captain Marvel series.  Carol Danvers promoted from Ms. Marvel to Captain Marvel?  Cool.

Nintendo Room - Lego Batman is fun!

Walked around the exhibit hall, dinner, then hotel check-in. Friday:

ParaNorman in Hall H - I got to sit in the press section!  It was cool, and I'm looking forward to the movie.  Did a write-up for Toon Zone:

http://www.toonzone.net/?p=19461&preview=true

ParaNorman roundtable interview - Never done one of these before, but I got to interview the cast and crew of ParaNorman!  Fun!

Kodi Smit McPhee - http://www.toonzone.net/2012/07/sdcc2012-a-roundtable-interview-with-paranorman-star-kodi-smit-mcphee/#.UCc25qNRpRE

Christopher Mitnz-Plasse - http://www.toonzone.net/2012/07/sdcc2012-a-roundtable-interview-with-paranormans-christopher-mintz-plasse/#.UCc296NRpRE

Anna Kendrick - http://www.toonzone.net/2012/07/sdcc2012-a-roundtable-interview-with-paranorman-star-anna-kendrick-2/#.UCc2-6NRpRE

Writers/Directors - http://www.toonzone.net/2012/07/sdcc2012-a-roundtable-interview-with-paranorman-writerdirector-chris-butler-director-sam-fell-and-producerlead-animator-travis-knight/#.UCc28aNRpRE

Producers/Animators - http://www.toonzone.net/2012/08/sdcc2012-a-roundtable-interview-with-paranorman-producer-arianne-sutner-production-designer-nelson-lowry-and-director-of-3-d-rapid-prototyping-brian-mclean/#.UCc246NRpRE

Tail End of Bones - David Boreanaz!  Haha, everyone asked him about vampires and Joss Whedon.  He's a great sport.

Arrow - O. M. G!!!  I'm really excited about this show!  They screened the whole pilot, and there's an Easter Egg in the first 15 seconds that had the audience gasping, and there was a ton of intense action.  The questions were all moderated, but when asked about if Dinah's going to become Black Canary, the producers said ""It's not as soon as you want, but it'll be sooner than you expect.""  YES!

More floor stuff, got a free Arrow comic, and then back to hotel.  Saturday:

Ballroom 20 Attempt - Ugh, so I met my friend Tom, who biked from LA, and then we went over to the Convention Center.  I thought I got into the Ballroom 20 line nice and early (over an hour before Once Upon A Time started), but I still didn't get in...grrr!  I really wanted to see OUaT, it had Ginnifer Goodwin, Emilie de Ravin, and a bunch of others from the show, but I guess people wanted to get into the room early, there were Simpsons and Family Guy stuff after...argh.

Cartoon Voices I - At least I made it to this one.  Matthew Mercer (who looks like he could be a live action Tygra), Debi Derryberry, April Winchell (yay!), Steve Blum (Wolverine!), Jim Ward, Jack Angel (12th highest grossing movie actor yeah!), and Chuck McCann (legendary).  Tons of fun!

Hasbro Marvel - I''m not a big toy collector, but it's cool to see what they have.

Con Atmosphere - Didn't go to many panels in the evening, had dinner with Tom, walked the grounds a bit.  Terry O'Quinn on a radio program!  Every single live action Batmobile!  

Anyhow, back to the hotel and on to Sunday:

Young Justice - Again, not familiar with the Nu52, but I did like to hear about the young heroes.  I do want to check out Teen Titans, it's just weird most of them haven't even interacted with their mentors yet (Wonder Girl hasn't met Wonder Woman, Kid Flash hasn't met Flash, etc.).  The best part of the panel were the fan costumes, they looked REALLY good.  Someone dressed as Cheshire from the Young Justice cartoon and had a baby Lian doll in her backpack.

Cartoon Voices II - Rob Paulsen (hilarious as always), Audrey Wasilewski, Gregg Berger, Misty Lee, Fred Tatasciore (Hulk SMASH!), and Dee Bradley Baker (I knew this guy was talented, but man...he's like the next Frank Welker).

Last Exhibit Hall Search - Like last year, I decided not to buy stuff until the last day, see what I could get cheap.  I ended up buying a Rorschach hat and two batarangs for $20.

So that was my experience.  I don't think I did as much as last year (and I didn't dress up), but I think I paced myself better, and I still had fun.  Comic Con...WOO!"

Getting my dishwasher replaced, and a lot of my roommate's stuff is still strewn about (plus I took a few furniture items of my friend who went back East for a while, long story).

But tomorrow I leave for Comic Con!  Oy, I'm not that prepared.  I looked at the schedule, there are a bunch of things I want to see, my roommate will be there for a few days, another friend of mine will be there for Saturday and Sunday, his birthday.  Plus I'm going to try and cover some stuff for Toon Zone.

It's going to be fun, I'm sure, but...tiring...maybe stressful...also I'm driving from LA to San Diego in a barely registered car with an interim driver's license and questionable insurance.  Lovely."

"event","Hi everyone,

So I had to be out of my apartment last Sunday the 17th.  The only problem...I didn't have a new place to live!  Still deciding on places.  So I moved my things into friends' apartments, my furniture into one friend's, smaller stuff into my future roommate's, and then the rest into the place I ended up staying.

Luckily, I did have a friend who let me stay on her couch for the week, meanwhile, my other friend and I decided on which place we wanted to live.  It was kind of a nightmare getting all the paperwork signed, and I had to play the waiting game while not really doing anything over the week, but I got through it.

So FINALLY I got the keys to my new place yesterday and moved most of my stuff in.  Hooray!  Except DWP said they won't turn my power on until Monday.  Boo!  And I'm shopping around for a good cable/internet/DVR package.  So no power...no internet!  I'm at the library right now getting in some e-mail/LJ time while I can...hopefully I'll have this stuff resolved early next week!"

"event","So, hard to believe I graduated a few weeks ago.  It was a great weekend, and all, it just went by fast.  My dad, my sister, and my aunt all flew in to LA (separate days, just to make it fun), and I had my exit interview with the Dean along with my classmates.

It was fun having my family here.  We hiked Runyon Canyon, saw an Anaheim Angels game, and we even ate at Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles!  Graduation was on a Sunday.  My class is small, and the ceremony went quickly.  And I officially got my MFA!  Just us Screenwriters and our families met and had a catered lunch.  It was amazing and delicious!

So families left and things got quiet...until we had to prepare our pitches!  It was actually pretty frightening, summing up our theses in 5 minutes and pitching our ideas to industry people.  And there were 11 of them!  That means I had to talk for nearly 90 minutes straight!

Oy, well, at least I got it over with and we all had a nice dinner afterwards.  And now...well, now's the part I don't know.  I'm still working at the library for the summer, and I'm going to have to move fairly soon since my lease is up June 17th.  We'll see where that takes me."

"event","In light of having stopped reading Amazing Spider-Man (finally given conclusion to the One More Day/Brand New Day/OMIT thing) months ago, finishing the Ultimate Spider-Man Death of Spider-Man arc, and the premiere of the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon as well as the upcoming movie, I felt now would be a good time to talk about what I consider to be a good way to portray Peter Parker as a character.

Spoilers for the Ultimate Spider-Man Death of Spider-Man arc.

<lj-cut>

Despite being first exposed to the Web Head on Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, my definitive Spider-Man was the one from the comics in the 90's.  That's the married Peter Parker, not Ben Reilly (although I love Ben to death).  I hated One More Day because it was such a horrible way to change the character, and while the Brand New Day stories did get better (mostly because they stopped interfering with the dang book with all these events and crap!), I felt a disconnect and had to drop the book.

I never stopped reading Ultimate Spider-Man, and I have every issue of the original run, 160+ and 3 annuals from the last ten years or so.  That Peter Parker was radically different, still in high school and given a more modern story (one the movies and the last two animated series draw heavily upon).  I love Bendis' Ultimate Spider-Man, despite not being my definitive Spider-Man, and while I was spoiled about it months ago because I'm so slow, I was still absolutely shocked Peter was killed and replaced by a new Spider-Man.  And saddened, because that's how much impact the character had on me.

The bottom line is, as I've always said, Spider-Man is such a unique character because just look at what superheroes were like when he hit the scene in the 60's.  He proved that teenagers don't have to be sidekicks, they can be heroes in their own right.  And with that, of course, comes teen angst.  Feeling responsible for the death of his uncle, taking care of his sickly aunt, job problems, school problems, girl problems.  Spider-Man OWNS that, I don't care what anyone says about any teenage hero, they owe it to Spider-Man.

HOWEVER Spider-Man shouldn't be all angst all the time.  I mean, the guy's a cutup.  His rapid-fire jokes are another thing that makes him who he is.  One of my absolute favorite comics of all time was a (Spectacular, I think? by Paul Jenkins) that was a flashback to Peter's childhood with Uncle Ben that wasn't filled with angst because it was all about how Ben taught him to laugh.  

And that's what Spider-Man is to me.  He's an underdog, both in and out of costume, fighting against the Parker Luck, but at the same time, that stuff doesn't beat him down.  He can laugh it off and continue to do the right thing, the responsible thing, and still be optimistic.  A quick rundown of how well I think they've handled this balance in TV and movies:

Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends - Brought the funny, but lost a lot of the Peter Parker stuff.  He was in college, which was fine, but having Angelica and Bobby as his superpowered entourage was...strange.

Spider-Man: The Animated Series - I loved the more responsible, smart Peter Parker who threw wisecracks around and was mature enough to actually get married.  Closest there is to my definitive Peter Parker.

Spider-Man Unlimited - An interesting twist having Spider-Man go off into space to take care of Venom and Carnage, who he considered were his problems, but the Peter Parker side of this wasn't interesting.  His love interests didn't make any sense, and his photographer job wasn't anything new.

Sam Raimi Spider-Man Movies - WAY too angsty and not nearly funny enough.

Spider-Man: The New Animated Series - Basically the same as the movies, only he was funnier (thanks to Neil Patrick Harris), but his girl problems were more tiresome.

Spectacular Spider-Man - A definite lack of maturity on his part, which is probably because he's at least a few years younger than the others, and his relationship with Gwen was getting to be tiresome, at least his Spider-Man persona did a good job of showing how seriously he takes his responsibilities.  The humor worked well too.

Ultimate Spider-Man - At least where it stands right now, it goes too far in the opposite direction as the Raimi movies.  WAY too much goofball stuff and his life as Peter Parker seems negligible.  Even worse than Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends because this show seems to be saying Harry and MJ are important and yet constantly show Peter/Spidey spending time with the other heroes, both in costume and out.  The show's funny, and Spider-Man does get his comeuppance when he does something irresponsible, but he just feels like too much of a screw-up and an idiot at this point.

Amazing Spider-Man - There's a good chance I won't see it in theatres.  Just from what I've seen, it's a bit too...dark."

"event","Okay, spoilers for the Young Justice episode from a couple weeks ago ""Image"", but something strange happened to me while watching it...then again at the library...

<lj-cut>

So, as you can see in my Tags, I AM obsessed with redheaded women.  This includes Miss Martian aka Megan Morse...but wait...does it include M'Gann M'Orzz?  Well, no, she is bald.  But...I like Miss Martian!  Actually, I don't like her too much in the comics, Teen Titans was a dark time back then.

But she's awesome on Young Justice!  I feel sorry for her, that she has to hide her true, horrific alien self from her teammates.  She shouldn't be lying to them by putting on a false persona...but her false persona is so much fun!  Hello, Megan!

I'm conflicted.  Do I like her because she's a cool character, do I like her fake personality, or do I like her shape-shifted redhair?  I dunno.  I was at work and saw the book ""Math Doesn't Suck"" by Danica McKellar.  Of course, I picked it up to look at it because, well ""Hello, Megan!""  But I read the intro, and it made me feel bad.  Here's the story she shared:

<i>I had a friend in high school who had beautiful, long, naturally red hair, and for years, everywhere she went, everyone told her how much they loved her long, red hair: friends, family, strangers, everyone. Finally, one day, when she was about seventeen years old, she showed up to school with her hair cut short - and dyed jet black!  She said she was tired of people complimenting her hair, and she needed to know what people liked about her. She had that same empty feeling on the inside that I did when people talked to me about being on TV.  She wanted to be valued for something real, for what was on the inside.  Of course, she was smart and funny and interesting - she just needed to figure that out for herself. And don't worry, her red hair did eventually grow back!</i>

So the moral of the story is...don't be obsessed with redheaded women just because they have redhair?  Uh...this might be a tough one..."

"event","...well, at least you can say I finished my New Years stuff before April.

Here are my Top Ten Muppets.

<lj-cut>

In honor of the Muppets movie, I decided to make my top ten list of my favorite Muppets.  I also decided to leave off the Sesame Streeters for convenience sake.

10) Swedish Chef

9) Sam the Eagle

8) Fozzie

7) Beaker

6) Waldorf and Statler (kinda has to be a tie)

5) Animal

4) Kermit

3) Gonzo

2) Pepe

1) Rizzo

Honorable mentions go to Rowlf, Miss Piggy, Clifford, Sweetums, and...ya know, pretty much everyone."

"event","With the Superman Movie Franchise (hopefully) restarting, what better way to get excited about it than thinking up casting choices?  Here are my Top Ten Reasons David Tennant should play Brainiac:

<lj-cut>

10) Brainiac is the biggest name Superman villain who has yet to be in a movie.

9) David Tennant has experience playing an alien.

8) Much like the Doctor, Brainiac regenerates into different bodies and is sometimes identified by number.

7) David Tennant has experience playing sciency-futuristic-type characters.

6) How awesome would David Tennant look in a big budget CGI movie AND Brainiac for that matter?!

5) Brainiac should speak with some otherworldly accent (perhaps English or Scottish, as long as it's not American).

4) David Tennant's certainly got the acting chops, and playing Brainiac would be a challenge for him.

3) Odd enough as it sounds, Tennant's body is kind of build like you'd expect a hyper-intelligent but still threatening alien nerd to look like...and his facial features too!

2) Brings in more British fans to Superman, always a plus.

1) Heck, it brings in more Doctor Who and Harry Potter fans as well!"

"event","Okay, catching up on the New Years lists I missed.  The first out of three is my Top Ten voices.  This year I decided to do Billy West because, yeah, the guy's hilarious.  I've been a fan of his for about 20 years at this point, and I love him in pretty much everything he does.

<lj-cut>

10) Bugs Bunny (Various) - Although not the best Bugs voice, it's perfectly workable.

9) Skeets (Justice League Unlimited, Batman: The Brave and the Bold) - Funny straight man/robot to the out there personality of Booster Gold.

8) Elmer Fudd (Various) - Again, like Bugs, he's not the definitive Fudd, but his voice fits the character well.

7) Zapp Brannigan (Futurama) - If anyone can pull off 50% Captain Kirk and 50% William Shatner, it's Billy West (I've no doubt in my mind Phil Hartman would've been hilarious, but West made the role his own and I can't hear anyone other than him).

6) Red M&M (M&M Candies) - He really makes the commercials quotable...and me hungry for plain M&M's!

5) Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth (Futurama) - Billy West doing a crazy old man voice?  Good news, everyone, he brings it hardcore on Futurama!

4) Dr. Zoidberg (Futurama) - The only funny, crazy voice of his that trumps Farnsworth is the pathetic, disgusting alien Zoidberg.

3) Doug Funnie (Doug) - When I was a kid, I identified with Doug so much.  West made him sound like the perfect neurotic ten year old.

2) Stimpson J. Cat (The Ren & Stimpy Show) - A show I still quote to this day, I loved how simple and idiotic West made Stimpy sound.

1) Philip J. Fry (Futurama) - If Doug is West at 10, Fry is him at 20, and my favorite performance of his.  While all the other roles are mostly comedic, his role as Fry manages to combine hilarious idiot and sympathetic everyman.  Fry manages to cover juvenile and more adult humor and stands out in a cast that includes robots, aliens, and other monsters.

Honorable Mention goes to Woody Woodpecker, Popeye, Porky Pig, Jeebs, and Slimer."

"event","Not really so far because I'm still busy with so much!  Actually, I can't say I haven't enjoyed myself, I did go to Vegas with some friends over the weekend.  I hate gambling (although there was a tempting Dark Knight slot machine), so I'm glad I got to see a show and eat some great food.  We stayed in the Stratosphere.  Plus we went to the Hoover Dam!  

But now I'm back...and doing work for the internships I told to leave me alone for the week and catching up on school stuff I've been severely neglecting.  I know it's my fault for taking on so much, and hopefully it'll be a good thing in the long run, but right now it feels like I'm doing the bare minimum to get by, and that's no good.

I need like an extra day to get stuff done...oh, wait, it's Leap Year.  I do have an extra day.  Maybe that means more stuff done, we'll see.  There will be more entries, that's for sure (I hope)."

"event","I'll be doing my usual New Years entries over the coming week, but right now, here's a sum up of my holidays:

<lj-cut>

So I flew to Connecticut on the 21st, and I made it there in one piece.  Although it took a while for me to adjust to the whole time difference thing (more than usual).  I was able to see a friend, and we went to see the Muppets!  Yay!

My sister drove from New Jersey Christmas Eve, and we hung out and junk.  Christmas Day wasn't bad.  I was sad there's only me, my dad, and my sister now, but we made the most of it.  I got the DVDs I asked for, including the complete Reboot, Community 1, and the fourth season of Lois and Clark.  Plus some other things and gift certificates!  We went to see some friends for an after Christmas dinner desert.

Not too much happened the rest of the week, I almost went into New York to see some friends, but that never happened.  I did see other friends before the week was out!  We went to Olive Garden.

I flew back to LA on the 30th, which was in time to prepare myself for the next day, New Years Eve!  Luckily, a couple of my friends also returned, but unluckily, all the places we wanted to go were either closed or too crowded.  They ended up coming over to my place, so we had pizza, wine, and so forth.  It was fun!

Spent the week doing...not a whole lot.  Watching stuff (including Lost...I'm on season 3 now!), and being kind of lazy, although I did run a couple days.  Don't have classes for another week, so that should give me time to mentally prepare.

Happy 2012 everyone!!!"

"event","::sigh:: So here it is, the end of the year.  My semester ended recently, so here are a few updates about various things:

<lj-cut>

-Avoiding drama by avoiding people, which may be a good idea but they may also think I'm mad at them.

-Finished the first draft of my thesis screenplay.  It's 128 pages, way too long, so hopefully I can shorten it to 110 or thereabouts next semester.

-Finished up my RKO internship and applied for Nickelodeon.  I made it through the phone interview, but I did pretty awful in person.  Sometimes I'm bad at first impressions.  I didn't get the internship, unfortunately, so I'll be at this Indian company next semester.

-Did get some good pitch practicing in, though.  Next semester, we're supposed to be getting mentors, courtesy of Bob Orci and Melissa Blake (the latter of whom I met, and she's pretty cool), which is exciting.

-Arrived in Connecticut yesterday and will be here until the end of next week.  Hopefully it'll be slow and relaxing, but not without some projects going on.

-Will try to do some end of the year wrap-up, since I was too busy to do some of the entries I wanted in August/September, I'm not sure how much I'll get to.

-Have started Lost recently, I'm about a third of the way into the second season (as my title indicates), and my progress will be a little different since I'm watching it through instant.

-As far as women and dating go...I'll save that for a future entry."

"event","I was going to do a farewell salute to Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and maybe I will someday, but it's past the 10 year anniversary of Justice League, and I've got some catching up to do.

To backtrack, those of you who watch Community may or may not realize that they paid off a three-seasons-long gag involving Beetlejuice.  In each season, someone would say his name, and a couple episodes ago, it was the third time someone said it, and Betelgeuse actually appeared in the background!

So I got bored today and watched Beetlejuice.  I don't know how this got past me, but I forgot ""Jump in the Line"" was sung in both The Little Mermaid III and Beetlejuice.  Chalk that up to another Batman/Ariel comparison.  Maybe I should list what those two have in common...nah, I'm going to talk about Batman and Hercules.

""Hercules?  By Neptune!""

<lj-cut>

I almost see Disney's Hercules TV series from the late 90's as a precursor to Batman: The Brave and the Bold.  Not only did it feature Deidrich Bader as Adonis, a main character, Hercules also teamed up with several heroes, including Hippocrates, Achilles, Prometheus, Nestor, Mentor, Merv Griffin, Captain Kirk, Orion, Triton, Thor, Orpheus, Electra, Ben Stein, Aladdin, Odysseus, Buffy Summers, Artemis, Alexander the Great, and also, Tempest and Theseus, who were Wonder Woman and Batman expies.

That's impressive, but not up to Batman's level, who teamed up with Green Arrow and Speedy, Blue Beetle III, Fire, Aquaman, Red Tornado, Guy Gardner, Etrigan, Merlin, B'Wana Beast, Wildcat, the Outsiders (Katana, Black Lightning, Metamorpho, Geo Force), Kamandi, Deadman, Blue Beetle II, Elongated Man, Atom III, Dr. Fate, Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps, Jonah Hex, Bronze Tiger, Red Hood, The Question, Adam Strange, Flash I, Sherlock Holmes, Black Canary, Huntress, Booster Gold and Skeets, Robin I/Nightwing, Bathound, Bat-Mite, Mr. Miracle, Big Barda, Hawk and Dove, OMAC, Enemy Ace, Detective Chimp, the JSA (Dr. Mid-Nite, Hawkman, Hourman, Alan Scott, Mr. Terrific, Spectre, Starman), The Metal Men (Tin, Iron, Mercury, Lead, Gold, Platinum), Firestorm, Kevin Conroy, Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Junior, Zatanna, the Phantom Stranger, Flash II, Kid Flash, Batgirl, the Doom Patrol (Negative Man, Elasti-Girl, Robot Man), Easy Company and GI Robot, Proto, The Freedom Fighters (Uncle Sam, Dollman, Human Bomb, the Ray, Phantom Lady), Martian Manhunter, Ice, Superman, Krypto, Scooby Doo and Mystery Inc, Vigilante, Wonder Woman, The Creeper, Atom II, Space Ghost, Captain Atom, Jeffrey Ross, the Creature Commandos (Shrieve, Griffith, Velcro, Taylor, and Rhodes), Abraham Lincoln, Ambush Bug, Ted McGinley, and the Batmen of All Nations.  Although they made appearances, I don't think he ever formally teamed up with the Challengers of the Unknown, Stargirl, Rip Hunter, 'Mazing Man, or Aqualad.

Now that's impressive!  Of course, Batman and Hercules have teamed up with each other numerous times.  I haven't seen Ides of March, but the poster to that is a Batman/Hercules team-up that would make Two-Face jealous.  Plus with Batman Year One, that retroactively makes The O.C. a Batman/Hercules team-up.  I haven't seen Meet the Spartans either, but I believe Batman and Hercules joined forces in that as well.  In addition to Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, the re's also the upcoming The Place Beyond the Pines and Lawless.  And...here's the kicker...the guy who played Hercules in the 1970's Shazam! show?  Adam West.

Okay,do you believe me? ::cue ""Jump in the Line""::"

Oy, it's not going to be as huge a Thanksgiving our first year...or even last year...but it's happening.  It's going to be at my place, so I volunteered to do the turkey.  Plus my typical potatoes and corn pudding.  Eek!

I did get a pre-cooked turkey...okay, pre-basted...all right, it was only a fresh turkey, but hey, I had to get a small one and they don't come in pre-basted.  Or at least, not at Albertson's.  I called them first and, basically, I got Jeff Alberston.

""Welcome to Albertson's!  We are the Worst. Grocery Store. EVER.""

Ah well, I got the bird, but I went to Ralph's for everything else.  Hoo-boy.  Well, wish me luck tomorrow with the cooking (also my roommate stole our coffee table and disappeared...ugh).

My school has Monday night screenings with directors, producers, etc. for various things.  This week was Van Partible, creator of Johnny Bravo.  He's an LMU alum, and he talked about creating Johnny Bravo and its popularity around the world, including India.  He screened Johnny Bravo Goes to Bollywood, a 75 minute movie.

It was pretty funny.  Not a laugh-a-minute deal, but there were some great jokes.  Afterwards, some of the cast and crew joined Van Partible on stage, including Sheetal Sheth (actress), Brenda Vaccaro (Johnny's mom), and Charlie Adler (casting director).  CHARLIE ADLER!

My friend Tom was there too, and he noticed how geeky I was with Charlie Adler there.  I couldn't believe it, I've been a fan of the man's work for over TWENTY YEARS!

After the Q & A was over, I wanted to shake his hand.  I was nervous, but luckily Tom was there to tell me to just do it.  So I did!  I told him how awesome he is, even if the only roles I managed to squeak out were ""Buster Bunny"" and ""Dr. Doom"".  He said ""Yeah, they should just put me away.""  Tom had to point out that we're not as young as he thinks (he made a reference to everyone in the audience looking like we're 9).  There were mostly undergrads there, which means I'm about ten years older than most of them.  Ah well, it was a great experience!"

"event","So last Monday was my birthday, and I didn't do much aside from take the day off from my internship and run 7 miles on the beach.  Plus I worked, but, ya know, I need the money.

Actually, I guess I didn't need it that bad since I got birthday money when I picked up my mail on Wednesday.  Hooray!  Guess that justifies my purchase of birthday loot previously, but I also ordered some more comic books.  After that, I'll have everything up to Flashpoint.  So what do I do after that in terms of DC?  Only time will tell.

Thursday was my actual celebration.  It's hard getting a bunch of people together because they're shooting or doing rehearsals or preparing to shoot.  So only half the people I invited came, but that was okay (especially since some of the people who didn't come chipped in and got me a nice, tall bottle of Johnny Walker 12 year blended scotch whiskey...yum!).  

So I decided I wanted to go to Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles.  I love chicken, I love waffles, what better way than to enjoy them both?!  And it was quite delicious, let me tell you!  I'll have to go there again.

Also, is it just me or do Alice and Belle buy clothes at the same store?

I got them last week, and that includes the last two Brightest Day trades (yeah, I'm slow).  Most of it was movies, though.

That includes Green Lantern: Emerald Knights (I had to hold off on All-Star Superman until I can get it from Deep Discount) and Superman/Shazam: The Return of Black Adam (too bad I was spoiled by Rob Lowe's Captain Marvel first, since I think I prefer him to Jerry O'Connell).

I also got the Secrets of Mary Magdalene, a DVD doc I worked on for an internship a long, long time ago.

PLUS I finally broke down and got Kid's Ten Commandments.  I don't plan on owning it, I'm going to donate it to my friend's church, but I wanted to watch it because of the ""Stolen Hearts, Stolen Jewels"" episode where Jodi Benson sings a duet with John Schneider.  George Newbern is in it too, so that's pretty cool.

Lastly but not leastly, I got Thumbelina, the Don Bluth film.  I'd never seen it, but Jodi Benson stars in that too as Thumbelina, and sings a duet with Gary Imhoff, who plays the fairy prince Cornelius.  Wait a minute, Gary Imhoff?!

"event","Completely forgot to talk about this in my last entry.  On the subject of Joker Vs. Wonder Woman:

<lj-cut>

Now, one of the most heated debate topics in JLU (and the DCAU and Batman's love life) is in ""This Little Piggy"" where Bruce tells Diana that if he has someone special, his enemies would attack him through her.  Diana shrugs it off, displaying her strength.  Obviously, Wonder Woman's on a strength level much higher than Batman's rogues (she could beat a Killer Croc juiced up on venom AND Man-Bat formula in an armwrestling contest).  However, the thing that got to me was, I agree with Batman...yet many people agree with Wonder Woman!  Here's my reasoning.

1) Batman's a kind of pessimistic/realistic guy anyway.  He's seen Joker nearly kill Superman (""World's Finest"") and Ra's Al Ghul nearly kill Superman (""The Demon Reborn"").  Plus, the Joker pulled a fast one on Wonder Woman in ""Injustice for All"".  Batman's villains don't screw around!

2) In addition, brute strength doesn't always cut it.  Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and the Mad Hatter all have mind control capabilities.  Wonder Woman doesn't have any defense for those if they take her by surprise (see ""Grudge Match"", which, technically, came after ""This Little Piggy"").  As seen in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Joker has Amazon affecting gas!  That's clearly enough reason for Batman to be worried about his villains harming her.

::sigh::

Speaking of The Mad Hatter, how sad is the ending to ""Mad as a Hatter""?  Original airdate October 12, 1992...19 years later and it still affects me!  I liked how the episode ends with a shot of the Mock Turtle.

Which, actually, is what brings me here.  I'm reading Tarnished Angel in Astro City.  It's pretty good, and I love the chapter on the villain the Mock Turtle (an obvious take on the Mad Hatter).  It's funny when he was a kid and hid in a closet trying to get to Narnia and attempting to go head first into a mirror!  Ah, poor sap.

Speaking of which, I went back to re-read chapters 9 and 10 of Alice in Wonderland, which is about the Mock Turtle.  That guy is in tears...and he used to be a real turtle at some point.  I can't help but feel bad for him.  Here's a quote:

""I'VE been to a day-school, too,"" said Alice; ""you needn't be so proud as all that.""

""With extras?"" asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

""Yes,"" said Alice, ""we learned French and music.""

""And washing?"" said the Mock Turtle.

""Certainly not!"" said Alice indignantly.

""Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,"" said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. ""Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill, 'French, music, AND WASHING--extra.'""

""You couldn't have wanted it much,"" said Alice; ""living at the bottom of the sea.""

""I couldn't afford to learn it."" said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. ""I only took the regular course.""

""What was that?"" inquired Alice.

""Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,"" the Mock Turtle replied; ""and then the different branches of Arithmetic-- Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision."""

Plus, more Bruce Wayne.  It's great to see an evening playing field with Batman working alongside his friends (or even the villains using their gimmicks to their advantage).

Also?  Avengers trailer.  Heck yeah!  I figure the movie is going to be about 120 minutes long, so, a 2 minute trailer...think I'll rerun it 60 times.

"event","Marilyn: Be careful with Marvel.
Me: You should've told me that 15 years ago.

My long and tortured love affair with Marvel Comics under the cut:

<lj-cut>

As I mentioned in my last fandom entry, I was taken in hook, line, and sinker by the toyetic cartoons of the 80's.  However, what had easily the biggest influence on my life was the cartoon known as Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends.

It was so cool, Spider-Man was funny and had all these amazing powers.  And he was everywhere!  Toys, video games, etc.  Through the toys (which came with cards) and the arcade games, I learned more about Iceman and his friends the X-Men.

It wasn't long before the X-Men got their own cartoon in 1992.  Around that time, a store called The Dream Factory opened in my local mall.  It sold comic books.  What was a comic book?!  I don't know, but it had Spider-Man, the X-Men, and a new issue would come out once a month EVERY MONTH!  And these comics had reached hundreds of issues, there was no sign of stopping!

My first comic book was Spectacular Spider-Man #199, which guest-starred the X-Men.  It was so much fun, I read it over and over!  At the end of the issue, the villainous Green Goblin, who somehow knew that Spider-Man was Peter Parker, kidnapped his wife, Mary Jane.  The next issue #200, promised to be a milestone and special anniversary issue.  Spectacular Spider-Man #200 was simply amazing...the Green Goblin turned out to be Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn, and even though he was crazy and wanted to ruin Peter's life, he eventually came to his senses just in time to save Spider-Man, at the cost of his own life.

It was a pretty intense issue, and I was hooked.  Being familiar with the Marvel Universe through the card series, I was curious about the Fantastic Four, and in addition to reading Spider-Man every month, I hopped aboard the Fantastic Four train to read the World's Greatest Comic Magazine!  I was a casual X-Men reader but could really sink my teeth into X-Factor, and eventually the new book, Generation X.

I bought the toys and video games, and my love of the Marvel Universe expanded, reading titles like Avengers (Heroes Reborn may be briefly drop Fantastic Four), Captain America, Daredevil, X-Men on a regular basis, Spider-Girl...basically my high school years (1996-2000) greatly expanded my love for and knowledge of comics.  And there were movies then too!  Blade, X-Men, and Spider-Man when I was in college...what a time to be alive.

Although Post-9/11 Bill Jemas-era Marvel was dull.  It was a time of decompression, and I feel like only Brian Michael Bendis could do it well.  Favorite heroes of mine like the Human Torch and Hawkeye got their own books, but they were boring.  The Ultimate Universe made me a bit uneasy because they didn't feel like the Marvel heroes, but at least their books weren't pissing me off.

That era ended soon enough, what with Mark Waid and Mike Weiringo's Fantastic Four and all, but then came Avengers Disassembled.  That was...bleh.  Yeah, I no longer liked Bendis.  I had been reading Marvel long enough to know that he was writing everyone stupid and out of character and the change-ups were just to grab attention (Spider-Man and Wolverine on the Avengers?  Gimme a break!).  The big events were fairly stupid, House of M, Civil War, Secret Invasion...World War Hulk painted the Illuminati in a bad light, and the heroes became unheroic (Xavier was ruined in a different story).  But nothing topped what they did with Spider-Man.  After talks and attempts to make Spider-Man single again, they finally did it, they had Peter and Mary Jane sell their marriage to Mephisto to save Aunt May.  BLEH!

Being in school, I'm down to about 5 Marvel titles a month, and I'm behind.  The Spider-Man thing really burned me, and no matter how inconsistent Marvel is as a whole, they'll still publish at least one thing a month that is enjoyable.  Plus, the cartoons and movies continue to be awesome.

Needless to say, when I saw that Marvel Studios was looking for interns, I applied immediately!  They called me for a phone interview last week, and I bragged about my skill, so they had me come in for an in-person interview.  I think it went well, but it sounds like they have a lot of applicants.

They said it would take about a week to get back to me, and I still haven't heard from them, so I'm nervous.  I told my advisor about it, and she said they may not be the best company to intern with.  I wouldn't get to sit in on any meetings, but I would be doing some research for them and typical office duties.

Eh, I have no idea...I need an internship, though, and soon!"

I don't know what was my first, and maybe that's important that I don't remember.  I will say that when I lived in my first house (which I moved out of when I was 3), I do remember having a He-Man sword and running around with it down my back.  That was awesome.

But, you know, ThunderCats, Voltron, pretty much anything that's come back NOW with all-new adventures (and Transformers, which never died out) are stuff I grew up on.

I'm watching the new ThunderCats series, but not Voltron, and I lost interest in both He-Man and TMNT...but I WILL get back into the new Turtles series!  I didn't even lose interest, I just lost track.

Today was the start of school for me.  Actually, school started Monday, as did my fall hours at the library, but today was my first class.  One more year, and I'll have my Masters.  Crazy.

So what does this year have in store?  I don't know, I still need my own reboot.  At least I'm wearing the glasses now.  At work on Sunday, I got to see this girl I kind of have a thing for, first time since she left for the summer, and it was nice to see her again, but...ugh...it's not going to go well.  Also, in class today, we had to write a description of how we think the world sees us and then someone else had to write a description for us.  Someone (not sure who) described me as ""Soft"".  I don't like it, and it actually makes me kind of angry.  Maybe my personality reboot will be darker and edgier."

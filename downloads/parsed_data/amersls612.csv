I still work at Lowe's, I have been promoted to head cashier and will transfer to the Lowe's store in Wauwatosa when I go to graduate school.

For those of you going, Wauwatosa? It's right outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 

Yes, I will be getting my masters degree in music performance at the University of Wisconsin. If you would like my mailing address, please ask.

I just got back from NYC for my cousin's wedding shower. I will be going back this coming weekend to see The Little Mermaid on broadway. 

Not a lot, but it should catch ya up.

This is mostly for my big sister Kate. Someone mentioned Colgate toothpaste and it made me think of her. I miss you."

The executioner's poor choice of rope and Ketchum's recent increase in weight combine to produce a gruesome decapitation in the gallows. (brought to you by dailyrotten.com)

Lowe's is still going well. I like the people I'm working with, or at least work directly with and they're pretty encouraging and nice. I'm also getting pretty decent hours which is always a bonus. There are some times that I'm saying yes to daytime hours which means I won't sub that day, but I think it's worth it. Lowe's also approved my trip to Alberquerque so I don't have to worry about that. They also approved my time off for my brother's wedding and for the bridal shower. I didn't request time off for the bachelorette party. Mostly because I honestly wouldn't really care if I didn't go. I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just not that I'm not much of a wine drinker and I don't know the rest of the people in the bridal party. If I was going with some of my friends that'd be fine, but it just isn't really my thing with a bunch of people I'm not friends with.

As I've mentioned I am starting my job at the bank at the Watkins Glen branch on May 14th. The drive seems like no big deal after having to do half a semester at the middle school there for student teaching. At least now I'll get paid for mileage to drive there. 

I've decided that I'm not going to look for a permanent teaching position. Well, I've been looking, but there's nothing around where I live. By that I mean within an hour drive. I don't think it's worth it to drive over an hour one way to work when it won't be the school I intend of teaching at for over a year. I'm just going to start subbing agin in September and continue my job at Lowe's."

Don't get me wrong, I didn't not enjoy it, but I only thought it was only just okay. I re-read it and I really liked it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The same was true for Christopher Moore's book Fluke.

I'll try, but I'm pretty spoiled and grumpy

27. What will you make sure doesn't happen in 07 that happened in 06?
Like I said, I'm going to try not to fall asleep while driving

29. Will you have someone to kiss at midnight?

I'm really excited for January 16th....Christopher Moore is coming out with a new book, You Suck: A Love Story. It really isn't a love story like a romance, he's a really funny author. If you have free time and about $13 extra dollars than I highly recommend you check out Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal. Anyway, You Suck sounds like it will be a sequal or continuation or a story envolving the previoius characters from his book Bloodsucking Fiends. In case you haven't guessed, it's a vampire book. 

Speaking of books....If you like reading about popular culture type things than I would recommend Chuck Klosterman's newest book A Decade of Curious People and Dangerous ideas.

I got called by the Horseheads school district for my first day of work. I was at the Intermediate School (grades 5 and 6) for physical education. The upside was that the teachers were doing a group unit so both gym teachers worked together to teach so I basically had to supervise. The only thing I needed to do on my own was adaptive physical education. All in all it was a good first day. 

In further news...I have decided to wait until Fall of 2008 to apply to graduate school. I'm going to take some time to work and make some money. I'd like to get a little more teaching experience before I leave the teaching arena for awhile since I want to go for performance.

I have to say though...the headjoint case is probably worth waiting the extra day or so for. It's not like a typicaly headjoint case, it's made of (leather maybe?) on the outside and the inside the headjoint is set in and the case actually goes around the headjoint an extra quarter turn and velcros down, which I actually kind of like. It's quite pretty and I am well pleased. 


My parents are starting to freak out a little bit about the whole ""pay back your loans"" and ""I want to go to graduate school"" thing. I'm not quite sure what I want to do yet....I guess it depends on if I get in anywhere and where it is. I think I like Hartt a lot, but I don't know if it's the idea of Hartt or if I actually want to go there. I'm going on a tour in December, going to a class and taking a half hour lesson with the professor there so that should give me a really good idea. I'm also applying to SUNY Fredonia and yes SUNY Binghamton. I realize that Binghamton doesn't have the greatest program, but I've heard raelly good things about the flute professor there so I'm not sure if it's worth it or not.


I'm almost done with student teaching and in some ways I'm sad and in other ways I can't wait to be done. I've decided that I really like doing younger students for lessons and band, but for general music things I like the older students. I'm having a lot of fun with my 7/8 general music class and I'm really trying to come up with some creative ideas so that makes it more interseting. I already have my first substitute position lined up and everything. I'm going to substitute for my first co-operating teacher when she goes to a conference in December so I get to sub for three days with some of the students I've already had. 

I'm also all set to play for a Thanksgiving service and a Christmas eve service here in Elmira so that should be a lot of fun. I don't really get to play much anymore except when I'm practicing so it's nice to ""perform."""

I'm tossing around the idea of taking a part time job, but I'm not sure if that would really be a good idea or not....

I'll have pictures up on my website soon. Lets see. We stayed at a really, really nice hotel that was close enough to everything that we could walk everywhere which was really nice (except for the fact that I got irritable because I was hot and had to walk a lot and I'm lazy). We saw the Vietnam Wall, Korean War Memorial, Lincoln Memorial, a bunch of other monuments and buildings, and two of the Smithsonian Museums and the Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Smithsonian Zoo. I would also like to say that the sore is because my legs hurt like hell from walking so much and not stretching or anything. Okay, maybe there'll be more later.

First minor good thing of the day. Since I'll be on orchestra tour Wednesday, I have an extra day or two to write my business journal/paper. Yup that's right, I have extra time to do it, and that makes me happy.


Fun news. One of my old friends from high school, and I'll be honest, I haven't talked to her in about 3 years may want me to play piano at her wedding. That's really exciting. I'm really happy for her that she's met someone she wants to spend the rest of her life with and makes her happy. I'm not sure if things will work out, but if they did, that'd be really cool (me playing piano work out I mean)."

"event","Today in History - 1994 - CIA agent Aldrich Ames charged with conspiracy to commit espionage. His betrayal, starting in 1985, resulted in the executions of a good number of important undercover agents within the Soviet Union. The CIA knew without doubt there was a mole in its ranks. And though by 1989 Ames had acquired unexplainable wealth from his spying and did very little to conceal the spying, he somehow managed to evade being caught for five more years.



Today is Orchestra tour. It isn't a real tour, but we are giving a concert at Lycoming College. I'm a little nervous because of the way the piano soloist was describing the hall, but hopefully all will go well."

I finished Neil Gainman's Neverwhere just in time for my Lemony Snicket book to arrive. I've already finished it because it was just that good. Dan got me Stephen King's The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower, so I will be starting that soon.


Lets see. I finally realized that I've been tonguing wrong (on the flute) and Dr. Molton never caught it. So means a) she's not a very good teacher, b) she knew but never stopped to address it/correct it, even when we did a masterclass and such on tonguing, or c) I'm just that good at doing things incorrectly that she didn't notice, even though other people did.


I had a really good weekend with Dan. He took me to The Wren's Nest and the food was really yummy. He also got me Stephen King's The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower. In addition, he got me a really neat keychain for my collection. And he made me this really neat Jasmine tea. I don't know how to describe it. It tasted really good, and it wasn't just a tea bag, it was the actual flower which was really neat. Oh, and there was the chocolate, that was good. We also went and ate Chinese with Megs, Tim, Stacey and Alex. Plus we saw the Pink Panther (funny movie). Yeah....it was a good weekend.


Alright, that's going to have to be enough of an update for now because I'm tired and I don't know what else to say."

"event","A Valentines Day in History - The eve of the Roman feast of Lupercalia. Naked youths would run through Rome, anointed with the blood of sacrificed dogs and goats, waving thongs cut from the goats. If a young woman was struck by the thong, fertility was assured. Pope Gelasius I decided this was a bit too much, and co-opted the Roman holiday to be the Feast of St. Valentine in 484 A.D.


Today in History - 1929 - The Capone gang kills six members of the ""Bugs"" Moran gang and one other person at the S.M.C. Cartage company in Chicago, in an event known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Bogus police officers were used so that it appeared to be a routine police bust. Except for all the bodies.


Dr. David Parks' recital last night was really good. If you weren't there, you missed out. It was all in English, and some of  the songs were really funny. He was a very good vocalist, and I admit, I didn't really want to go, but I'm glad that I did.



I'm reading Neil Gainman's novel Neverwhere. It's really good so far. It's really interesting to describe, I'm not really sure I could catagorize it. I don't really get scared very easily, so I'm not sure if you'd call it a scary or horror novel, but it is suspensful. It also has certain qualities that make it a little bit like a fantasy. It's his first solo novel. USA today said ""It draws equally from George Lucas, Monty Python, Doctor Who and John Milton...The chimerical stuff of nightmare and daydream"" if that helps any."

Well, after about 13 minutes on the phone (which isn't really that bad) and having people in Maple and Pinecrest check their mail rooms I have finally figured out what is going on with my book (Lemony Snicket's unauthorized autobiography) that I ordered from Barnes and Nobles. They are considering it lost (so if it somehow shows up in the next month I just have to call them and they'll make arrangements for it). They're resending it to me at the same cost minus shipping, and I'm sending it to my parent's house in Elmira. Yeah...now they have no excuse for me not getting it, damnit. 


And I don't really feel ditzy, I just like that the icon guy is sticking out its tongue. 



And, if I may ramble, I hate it when people don't use proper grammer in their info on AIM. Geesh. I'm sorry, but at a collegiate level you should know the difference between ""your"" and ""you're"" and be able to use both words appropriately."

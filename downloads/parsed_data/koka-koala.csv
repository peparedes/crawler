"event","frantically trying to find trust in.... myself. all day things have felt weird to me, nothing feels normal at all. every now and then i would see things in black and white.... not really but thats what it felt like. i've felt emotionally hurt all day, although no body did anything to hurt me.  Well actually, it started last night, i was in bed and i couldn't sleep, i felt like i was preparing for the worse day of my life, like some one would be dead when i woke up. Maybe that is why i have had such a strange feeling all day long, maybe i've been waiting for something aweful to happen.  Mrs. Seward never told us to do an assignment which was due today, so i guess i got a 0, and i got a test back in which i got a C+ and a paper that i also got a C+ on and i have to rewrite a paper that apparently was too bad to grade.... this has never happened to me in english before, i've always done very well in that subject. I'm learning more and more about myself each day, maybe that has been the reason for my lack of focus in english. i realized a long time ago that i do something very strange, i've told a few people i believe but never really in detail.  Everything that happens to me, every moment of my life, i veiw as a movie. sometimes my character changes and i'm not always the lead role, but my eyes move like a camera, i focus close on peoples faces and pan from person to person, or sometimes i focus more on a scene in its entirety (sp?) like i don't focus on one person but more so everyone that i can fit into the frame. and theres always music in my head to go with the emotions, a lot of the time not even actual songs but rather songs that i'm making up. and when i feel like i'm in a very trippy spot or even a very sad spot i move my eyes from place to place a lot slower. Now, i said all of this to make a little point. I think doing this increases the emotion of a situation inside of me, and rather shrugging off little things i get immensely sad and torn up inside, like today. i mean its not always bad because it can work the other way too, like when something feels good and fun and something rather uplifting is happening, i think i sometimes feel happier than i should. but yea, i think that might be why things were feeling strange and all black and white for me today. 

i hope that made some sense."

"event","so i just had a wild thing happen to me:

so, i'm takin a shower and then i start to feel kinda sick, like i'm gonna pass out, and i start to get dizzy, so i decide to sit down so i don't fall and smash my head open.  So i'm layin on the ground of the shower and i either fall asleep or pass out for a really long time. While sleeping i must have hit the lever that plugs the drain, cuz i wake up with a mouth full of water in a full tub and i'm choking and i start to freak out and i'm floppin all around and everything looks very grey and then in a panic i just roll out of the tub onto the bathroom floor, breathing very heavy and still kind of choking, then i shut off all the water and drained it, and just layed there....."

today, although it was ""beach day"" which i think sucks, i went as Hunter S. Thompson, and everybody that knows about him or has seen Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas told me i looked awesome and just like him. other people who didn't know thats who i was going as just told me i looked awesome.

"event","too many deaths, too much sadness.... this is really crappy....  the wake and funeral weren't too bad because i was with tons and tons of straight up italians and they were really loud and talking and laughing a lot so it kinda made it hard to be sad, which is actually kinda the way it should be, celebrate the persons life.... especially when they were 98 almost 99.

messy life... messy messy life... gotta figure out what i want."

"event","i haven't updated this in a lil while cuz of fricken exams and stuff, that week was pretty sucky, but it was pretty cool, we didn't have school on friday cuz it was too cold outside, but that means that tuesday i'll have band and chorus exams, which also means that i won't be able to go to my nana's wake and funeral which is sad cuz i really want to go.

She died yesterday.... she was my great grandmother, always seemed healthy as an ox, she was 98 almost 99, you could ask her if u could take a picture of her and she'd stop, flip her hair, put her hand on her hip and pose like she was doing a photo shoot at the age of 20. Its sad to see her go, but at the same time we shouldn't really be sad, we should celebrate her life because i could only wish to live as long as her and to have such a good life as she did.... i was ok when i was told the news the second i woke up yesterday morning, but later on i cried, i cried everytime i had to tell somebody, i had to tell my brother because he was in CT... that was the only time i didn't cry, i guess i felt like i had to be strong.... i dunno....

i saw the district concert yesterday which was pretty good, enjoyable to watch, and my friend katie did a wonderful job along with my other friend emily.

then i saw Big Fish..... wow..... wow wow wow..... that is an amazingly great film, i loved it, it really has a lot to do with believing and it intertwines fact and fiction very well and tim burton is an amazing director and shot this film like no other i have seen, this is just a real masterpiece, please, go and see Big Fish"

"event","i cannot bring myself to study right now, i've been trying and trying but everytime i look at the book i feel like i'm going to vomit.  that is not a good feeling at all.... And i really need to know this stuff if i'm not going to fail. My sister told me not to study because mr. G is a crazy man and his exams are impossible, but i did alright on them last year, and my brother always did good and he studied for them. Arggggg.... i just really don't wanna do this god damn stuff.

i'm feelin really lonely right now... i hate when i get like this, its the most god-aweful feeling. i just feel like there is nobody to talk to and nothing to do. Usually when i feel this way i play the drums but my mother would kill me if she knew i wasn't studying. I think i just need a really really really good friend to talk to.... i dunno if its that i don't have any or if that i don't know which one to pick....

jared was juggling a lot today, and he told me i should give it a try, so i have been and i'm decent for my first real try. I can get it goin for a lil bit, i just gotta practice a lot and i should get pretty good at the rate i'm goin.  

i can't wait for my hat to come in and hopefully i can get those canes soon too.... i finally feel like i'm becoming me, and finding my identity and being able to express myself. I like it a lot.

oh well... back to trying to force myself to study.... fun fun."

and i really like it and i think it fits my personality, i also found some good canes i might get.... that'd be a good time.

i was talking to sarah, actually still am, and she's making me pretty happy, she's nice, a good friend.... and she's funny, and has a great taste in music and movies... 

sarah: canes were made for you
sarah: i could just see you walking down the streets of northampton wearing that hat and swinging around a cane

hell yea...

i got shitty ass exams tomorrow but o well... can't do much about it but study... but i have something to look forward to, my hat, and hopefully a cane.

things with the new years resolution are goin good.... thats all i have to say about that one.

i'm feelin pretty good right now, and ya know what? i'm a-gonna go eat some cake.

"event","its funny.... i always have so many problems goin on in my head... but as soon as i decided to start writing on this to get them out of my head, i haven't had any, my lifes been rather good and happy lately... not many complants... the only little thing is the Big T, i don't like him. he gave me bad vibes, and then threatened dave, so that just wasn't cool, but i'm bein good and not startin something.

bob dylan... theres a genius. brilliant.

wow... i really can't wait till dave gets some good lyrics and is ready to sing for us, cuz that song is just so beautiful and its moving and u can tell its from the heart, i just love it. i just have this feeling that if dave really uses his gift to the best of his ability he'll be bigger than jesus, and essentially, the beatles. whoa. 

so yea, i decided to try to make another friend (which was my previously talked about new years resolution) i had already completed it with megaloo, now i'm tryin to spark another friendship up. 

i gotta get to bed, school tomorrow, tho i won't sleep for a long time..... oh that magic feeling."

"event","first day back to school, pretty good, not too hard.... not too soft. mrs. seward was back today and she was acting a bit kinder and i liked to see that side of her, it made me happy. I feel really bad about all the aweful things i said about her now. i really feel bad for her, i wish there was a way to apologize.  

i decided on my new years resolution about a month and a half before new years, and then i accidentally completed it a little less than a month before new years. so i don't know whether to count it or not, i think i am but since i liked the resolution, i'm gonna try to do it again.

i watched ed wood last night and benny and joon a couple nights before that, and johnny depp is just amazing, i love him as an actor, he is the most convincing actor i have ever watched, its wonderful.

i jammed a little bit with michael and dave today and dave brought forth a really pretty and powerful song that i really really like a lot.  He didn't like the words so he didn't sing them but he played the melody on the bass and i really liked it a lot. he is a really talented musician, i'm very glad i'm able to jam with him, its always a pleasure.

i realized that the past few days i've been really happy and upbeat, i don't know what it is, maybe it has to do with the moon and the stars.... no matter what, i like it."

"event","well last night i had a good night with emalie, we hung out watched some stupid movie for her history class and then another one.  then she went home and i talked to her after, we had a nice talk, i was enjoying my night a lot, and then i talked to some people online, which i also enjoyed, then i started to watch Ed Wood but didn't finish it. 

I woke up this morning a little scared because i had remembered my dream, it was one of those dreams that things changed so rapidly that i can't remember all of it but i do remember that mrs. seward was in it in a grocery store and we talked about her husband and she told me how she missed the feeling of kissing him, i got scared.  

we have school tomorrow, but i'm not gonna let that affect me because i'm in a good mood and i don't feel like thinking about it or complaining or any of that, so i'm not gonna.

wow, i'm in a very good mood, this is great."

"event","well i'm new to this, i saw that a lot of people were starting to do this thing so i thought i'd give it a try, usually when i try this type of thing i never remember to update and the such like, but i'll do my best.

anywho, today i woke up and took a shower and got dressed and then my mother told me i was going to get a haircut, what a joy, so i did so, and its alright, today has been very slow and i really want to do something with someone because i'm bored. Mitch came over last night and we watched Benny and Joon which is a brilliant movie and i suggest it to everyone, Depp is an amazing actor and he's great in this film. 

I have come up with many ideas for movies and about last week i came up with my favorite one yet, and i ran it be michael last night and he thinks its a good idea too, so we are gonna start writing it hopefully in the very very very near future and when we are finished with it we'll round up our crew and start some no-budget filming. I really hope this works out cuz i love the idea and it would give my life some meaning at this point in time. I'll keep you updated on that.

now its time to get some homework done since i only have two days to get it all done."

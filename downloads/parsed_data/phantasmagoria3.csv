"event","Naively paddling life's tempested seas
Melodiac dying on every side
Life given meaning without a purpose
A society of orange construction barrels. 
All these beautiful complexities,
Ya, all these beautiful complexities. 

Life's got a purpose
Traffic Jams build patience
Seaside vacations rejuvenate
& Love is purple hearts dancing in the moonlight
Love is purple hearts dancing in the moonlight
Ya, all these beautiful complexities...

Open sea churns my soul
Black fingers creeping creeping
(Seeking, hoping, yearning, loving)
Painted sunsets in my mind
Yellow ochre burning paints
All these beautiful complexities, 
Ya, all these beautiful complexities...

Life's got a purpose
Traffic Jams build patience
Seaside vacations rejuvenate
& Love is purple hearts dancing in the moonlight
Love is purple hearts dancing in the moonlight
Ya, all these beautiful complexities...

Love without Joy
(impossible, impossible)
Peace without You
(impossible, impossible)
Love without You
Peace without Joy
(impossible, impossible)

Life's got a purpose
Traffic Jams build patience
Seaside vacations rejuvenate
& Love is purple hearts dancing in the moonlight
Love is purple hearts dancing in the moonlight
Ya, all these beautiful complexities..."

"event","Thrown into the Cosmos
A mile a minute
Once gone, never replaced
Precious jewels forced upon you
Pause, rewind, stop, play
Where's the volume?
Cover your ears
Hide in a corner
Still they find you
Buzz round your head
Sting one thousand times
Heal your worst wound
Greatest Love encapsulated
Volumes and texts
Novels and chats
Whisper, shout
Love, hate
What will your words say
About 
You?"

"event","A common wardrobe the magic portal
To another world where children uncover
Lions, witches, and magic immortal
Animals speaking, with much more to discover
Aslan is on the move! With Him comes Spring
Prophecy fulfilled, curse shall be broken
When over Narnia rule two Queens, two Kings
The Witch's curse weakens with each word spoken.
One child falters and to the witch falls
As three discover the battle begun
Children were they, but each learns to stand tall
As Aslan gives up his life for Edmund
Darkness covercomes and sisters weep
How evil rejoices at this victory!
But Good o'erturnes evil with magic deep
Sorrow recoils when Aslan they see.
The four Kings and Queens reign from Cair Paravel
With joy and peace till the Golden Age fell.

"event","Life blood courses through veins 
Of passion. Another bruise
Another day lived ...barely survived.
Hurt mix with despair 
Joy gone ...Day dreaded 
An end to comfort of night

Do you believe? (Believe)
Do you believe in Faeries?
Do you believe there is more
The day is not the end?

Creeping despair sucks at the soul
Fareies flitting hoping seeking 
Each wounded torn apart
They wait, they hope. Faeries....

Do you believe? (believe)
Do you believe in Faeries?
Do you believe there is more
The day is not the end?

The knife you lift 
Breath faeries hold
Helpless desiring passion overflowing
Cold hard steel touches flesh
First faerie falls. 

Do you believe? (believe)
Do you believe in faeries?
Do you believe there is more
The day is not the end?

Reality hits as knife cuts 
Too late-Too late
Faerie tears touch your face
Burning healing 
Too late Too late

Do you believe? (believe) 
Do you believe in faeries?
Do you believe there is more
The day is not the end?

""If only""s course through your head
If only...
If only you had believed in faeries
If only you had kissed your little brother
If only if only. 

Do you believe (believe)
Do you believe in faeries?
Do you believe there is more
The day is not the end?

Death seemed easy way out
Life was not worth fighting for
If only you had seen
The love surrounding you.
The hole you leave...

If only if only

Too late Too late

If only..too late  

...now

Do you believe?"

"event","dear all, 
we are shamelessly asking for your help to load our POD on the 27th of December. I do not have a firm start time, but it should be pretty quick if we get enough people. I will have beer and pizza and love. 

For the cooks amongst you, you can take away your choice of perishables (various fancy sauces, curry pastes and such that need to remain refrigerated, hence cannot keep or transport safely). 

For the artists amongst you, I have some large Reeves BFK sheets of paper (white), other kinds of paper, plywood panels for painting or collage work, some other stuff that I cannot transport safely and can be yours for the asking.

We also have some furniture we need to give away before then, so if you need a table, a bookshelf, a fan, kitchen stuff, desks, a dvd rack, charcoal grill, clippers, curling/flat iron, an older couch, et cetera, please let me know asap. If you know someone who might need these things, also, let us know or have them contact us. We are only keeping about one room's worth of stuff.  

If you want/can help with loading on the 27th or want some furniture, please leave a comment below. 

I am freaking out, bring some beer and come drink with me while I pack this week. We are off the 1st of January, so make sure we see you before then. 

-kaos out

P.S.: If you have my LAMB-What Sound album, I would really really like it back (blue cd with a white lamb on it). Also, missing a few books that I cannot recall to whom I lent... if you have something that you think is mine, let me know and I am sure we can work out a mutually beneficial exchange of commodities.

P.S.S: If you lent me or frank something that you never got back, ping us, call us, show up at our house and claim it in the name of the queen of Spain. (Bring your own flag.)"

The real issue that seems to be happening here is a ""sex-panic"".  Allow me to diverge from the the context of the video game to the larger one, since video games and the posing of their characters can be seen as just another form of sexual expression. Excuse the theory and the history involved in this writing, but i believe it could be benificial. Let me first explain what I mean by sex panics. Sex panics are a colonial discourse on sexuality that utilizes a presupposed morality and the 'power to punish'. Here is how your argument fill into that trap: your argument presupposes a natural perversity and deviance in the desire to view an attractive nude body, which is a fairly Christian Western (colonial)  idea. The argument is seated in a heterosexual context, ""guys and people who like titties"", I would like to clarify that ""the other people who like titties"" are bisexual and lesbian women, but above all they are women. The assumption that the female body is only attractive to guys and an unnamed group of people is at best uninformed. One of the following posts claimed that men had more of a sex drive, which I would like to point out is not a biological fact of life.  We have been conditioned as women to pretend that sex does not exit, and that people do not have bodies. Overcoming those myths is essential to our liberation as women.

A claim has been made that ""pornography and the sex industry are evil"" for all they do to women. I know that the claim is being made with the best of intentions, however, we have to be extremely careful when making such claims and becoming overly emotional about them.

Censorship of sexually related expression is not pro-women, it is in fact dangerous to women, and here is why. The anti-pornography movement has its roots in Radical feminism, especially, in late-19th- and early-20th-century protectionist women's movements. Then, as now, energy was diverted from serious problems of women by focusing on a quick fix. The temperance movement turned women's anger against domestic violence to a campaign to ban alcohol. Rape and abuse went on unabated. I would suggest reading any/all of Lisa Duggan's work, at least her essay ""Sex Panics"".

In the social purity movement of that era, women concerned with the economic and sexual vulnerability of young urban women joined forces with conservatives ""whose aim was to enforce morality and not to protect women."" The result: laws suppressing prostitution, which operated to penalize prostitutes, making many women's lives harder and more dangerous.
Similarly, the restrictive measures of anti-pornography proponents Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin are pushed by Christian fundamentalists and others on the right, whose agendas are explicitly anti-feminist and anti-gay. 

Canada's Supreme Court, in its 1992 Butler decision, applied MacKinnonesque language to old definitions of obscenity. Holding that a group of videos were ""degrading"" and ""harmful"" to women, the court set equality principles in opposition to free speech and said equality considerations overrode the Canadian Charter's free speech guarantees. In the decision, the claim that pornography ""harms"" women was unsupported. 
Although the decision was hailed as a great victory for feminist anti-porn forces, ""the Butler decision belongs to the conservative Right.""

The Supreme Court of Canada doesn't give a damn about gender equality.
It is concerned about control and was pleased to have a feminist gloss put on it."" Not surprisingly, ""the fallout [from Butler] has been harassment of gay and lesbian bookstores,"" including the seizure of Bad Attitude, a lesbian-feminist magazine of sexually explicit expression. 

Your argument is utilizing a very traditional theory of gender difference [which argues that] pornography is not speech, because men are beasts. When confronted with misogynist literature, they are seized with the irresistible impulse to act it out. It is not simply that pornography is bad, it is the combination of pornography and men that's bad, because men are bad. So women need protection from men, at any cost. The fact that this protection is coming from Radical Feminism does not make it any better or any less misogynistic, in my opinion. 

Conservatives' cooptation of anti-porn feminism, beginning with the Meese Commission on Pornography opened to door to making ""degrading"" a crossover term, used by feminists to mean suggestive of a servile female sexual role and by vice-squad types to mean and ""immoral"". To deny the richness and diversity of what we call ""woman"" by claiming a single ""true morality"" to rule them all is certainly counter productive to the cause.

Sensationalized imagery of women, of gay men, of blacks, of latinos, of arabs, of asians is a symptom of a much more dangerous disease. Censorship of fantasy is not the answer tho. The moment you equate ""desire"" with ""deviance"" and ""evil"", the conservatives have one, and might as well go back to the kitchen and hang ourselves, for an anti-materialistic and overly theoretical women's movement is not going to get us anywhere. Any movement that is based on the fear and loathing of anyone is a failed movement. 

Ostracizing Mrs Centerfold, as dumb as she maybe, reinforces a heterosexual model of a ""national family"" of an imagined community with limited finite boundaries that includes the ""us"" , the ""normals"" and advocates the basic heterosexual, married, monogamous, reproductive , basically ""at home"" model, which is a far more dangerous patriarchal piece of shit to women's rights than anything else I can think of right this moment. You might ask, what the hell does that have to do with anything? Well, bear with me. Morality, protected by censorship, has the heterosexual ""national family"" model at heart. Advocating sexual expression censorship is advocating all anti-obscenity laws, where does that take us? Well, to the zones of contest of course, pornography is ""bad"" because it is, argued by anti-vice supporters, an a ""deviant"" sexual act. Deviant according to whom, you must ask your self... what is the standard I am using to make this judgment? Could not we by the same token start censoring all other forms of sexual expression, hell, it is already going on. Masturbation - deviant, sex education in schools - deviant, same sex couples- deviant, unmarried heteros- deviant, promiscious heteros--deviant, single-parents--deviant, sex-work--deviant, trasvestites, transsexuals--deviant..... I hope you see where I am going with this, pornography is a highly politicized issue and you should ask yourself, always,  who am i fighting for, and who am i fighting against, and most importantly..why?? (Read ""Thinking Sex"")


I would love to go on, but it is past midnight and i need to wake up early tomorrow. Allow me however, to refer you to Cherris L Moraga's book "" Loving
in the War Year"". You would find a much more enlightening analysis than I can ever offer, definitely much more eloquent and enjoyable than my endless blathering here. to entice you, i am going to quote one of the most essential paragraphs to understanding the problem at hand "" Radical Feminist have failed to acknowledge how their position in the dominant culture, as white, middle-class and often Christian, has influenced every approach they have taken to implement feminist political change and to "" give women back their bodies""...Unlike battered women, anti-rape and reproductive rights workers, the anti-porn ""activists"" never HAS to deal with ANY LIVE woman outside her class and race... The tactics of the anti-pornography movements are largely symbolic and the needs of the women of color are a lot easier to represent on paper than in flesh... it is NOT that pornography is not a concern to many women of color; but the anti-materialistic approach of the [radical feminist anti-porn] movement makes little sense in the lives of poor and Third World women. Plainly put, it is OUR sisters working in the sex industry"" ... personally, i would rather get them legalized, give them health care and retirement benefits before they are old and on the streets. That should take priority over censorship.

We as women seem to suppress the issue of our own sexuality when talking about our liberation. I do not know how lesbianism and feminism (and i am not necessarily equating the two) has turned into an ""idea"" , a political response to male sexual aggression rather than a sexual response - a woman's desire for another woman, and woman's claim over her OWN body as a sexual being.

There are a lot of complex issues that are being tossed around here and I think it is a good place for all of us to stop and think. It is truly refreshing to see that much fire on such a small webspace.

Keep burning..."

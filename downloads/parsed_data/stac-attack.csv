"event","Okay people. (Namely Areli) Let me tell you something. Carrie was my best friend for the past seven years. We understood each other very well. The thing that I liked the best about her was the fact that she never lived her life for show. Even when she was healthy and cancer was the furthest thing from her mind, she always kept a good relationship with herself and God. So when she was diagnosed with cancer, nothing changed. She new she would be okay either way. Don't get me wrong, Carrie wanted to live. She had a lot of good things to live for. But she figured that if God wanted her then that was okay too. Carrie had no regrets. I know this because she told me. And shes never lied to me as long as I've known her. So I'm going to keep doing exactly what I've been doing for the past seven years: Im going to be happy when she is happy, sad when she is sad, and most importantly be at peace when Carrie is at peace. And I know she is because she told me."

I was lucky enough to be lulled to sleep by her high pitched squeals.

God help me."

"event","Alright, this is sort of an advertisement. I am currently sharing an apartment with Lesley in the midtown area, but unfortunately Lesley wants to move downtown once our lease is up in May. This means that I need a new roommate. If any of you guys know anybody living in Anchorage that needs a new apartment (and isn't some kind of serial killer) please toss them in my direction. Its a pretty good sized unit. Rent would be $425 a month plus electric. If they want to get a hold of me, have them email me at staceymcgee_8@hotmail.com"

"event","Okay everyone. I've found my soulmate. His name is Luke, 6'1"", 22, hispanic, black hair, black eyes, and for all the Arelis reading this message, his butt is perfect. But wait, I haven't even gotton to the good part yet. Our english teacher made us do a bunch of those ""getting to know you"" excersizes in class and I learned three very important things about this guy:

A: He loves Star Trek and Harry Kim is one of his favorite characters

B: He goes to the gym and lifts wieghts four times a week (actually I could tell this just by looking at him, but I thought I'd add it in anyway for Areli's sake)

C: He is a die hard Hanson fan - and proud of it

Now all I have to do is convince him that not being gay is in his best interest. Its just a matter of time until he' mine. Right?"

"event","I just went to a movie this afternoon with my cousin. It was one of those movies that makes you go hmmm..... It's called Mean Creek and its about a kid who keeps getting beat up by a bully at school. His older brother finds out and then he and his buddies come up with this plan to get back at the bully. But then when they decide to carry it out, they find out that the kid isn't really so bad. I know it sounds like your average self discovery movie but it really isn't. What caught me about it was that its so realistic. Like almost painfully so. It has a really sad ending, so don't watch it if your depressed, but I would definitely reccommend it to anyone."

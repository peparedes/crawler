"event","I don't know who will read these entries, because they are public. I would appreciate you commenting if you do read this...just so I know. thank you
But, I'm going to say this now because I'm sick of being scared of what others will say, or them misinterpreting what I say. So, there are no apologies. I hate writing things on xanga and then people judging me because of them or criticizing me. I am not stupid enough to write personal things, but its my own freaking journal and I will write what I want. So please, I am unapologizing ahead of time. Just let me be. 
  and, if you are reading this please don't add me to your friends list (unless thats the only way I can read your site) or talk about this site or anything. I know alot people read livejournals, and though it's near impossible I'd like to keep it as private as possible. 
and if you want more positive entries, go read my xanga. that has to be ""edited"" for the satisfaction of the masses.
AND SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME MAKE THIS SITE LOOK COOLER...."

"event","So, time for something a little different. I'll still be on xanga...Though one of these days I'm just gonna find a random blog site for me and my friends. I hate the public eye. When I'm not the one choosing how I'm presented to it. In politics, in performing-there I love the public, I relish it. But here, when I sometimes I just want to be myself, or at school, then I hate it. 




The adrenaline has worn off, the nerves are gone, the excitement still slightly lingers.  And you are nothing but an empty shell. All you want to do is hide from this world because now it's not the only one. I don't care if I'm on display just as long as I don't have to be me."

"event","So. I've been up to a lot. Sort of.
Work is boring as hell. And my boss keeps screwing up my schedule. So its annoying. I've changed my mind since my last post. It is that bad. There's one insane!!! woman who keeps coming in. Calls me by my first name and all. Every time she sees me she grabs something off the nearest rack to come to my register. Shows up the next day to return it (because she doesnt care about the size. she wants to talk and stuff). Shes pretty disgusting. Covered in coffee the other day. Yeah. Then one guy flirted with me like insanely. He was like 50. It was gross.
Camp started! Its a ton of fun, as always. There hasn't been any drama yet, which is amazing. I love this show. I think everyone should come to see it. Its Chicago, by the way, and its going to be amazing. Especially the Cell Block Tango. It looks amazing, from what I can see. I'm in one of the cells, until the very end. Very fun.
So. My parentals are on vacation. So The house has been insane. To say the least.
Um I got my report card. I have a 5.7 GPA, and I'm 46 out of like 1100 kids. I'm quite proud of this year. I'm just hoping I stay in the same spot next year. I'm a little nervous. I want to stay top 50 at least.
There has actually been very little drama for me this summer. Its proving to be quite nice. Aside from the drama that was slightly mentioned last entry, its been incredibly peaceful. Of course, there has been in-house stuff going on, but other than that, my friends and I are getting along great. I've been hanging out with Sam, Sammie, and Griff constantly. I couldn't ask for better friends. Too bad Sam is going away so it won't be like this next year. Which is sad.
College changes everything. All of the relationships with my friends have changed, some for the better, and some for the much, much worse. I just hope that I stay in touch with the friends that mean a ton to me.
Thats my rant.
Comment.
Let me know someone is reading.
lol.
I don't care who you are or what you have to say."

"event","So. I've been busy.
Senior Prom was great. My friends are amazing. We went in the limo, and drank our sparkling cider, took gazillions of pictures, went to prom, danced, me and griff took the cutest prom picture, went to maloney's, and into boston the next day. It was great.
Graduation was depressing. I miss all my seniors. Not to mention that I'm terrified of being a senior myself. Going away to college will be hard.
All my friends are back in Brockton! Its great. I missed always having someone to call to hang out. And I missed having my friends to talk to if I needed it. I have people here that I can talk to, definitely, but there are some people that relate to different things.
I went on my meet and greet with my potential new doctor. I didn't like her. She seemed condescending, and like she was trying to impress my mom more than me. I'm the patient, and its my decision, and I felt like she was trying to hard. And I didn't feel like I could talk to her about anything. Like, it seemed like itd be hard to open up to her and stuff. So now I'm meeting with other doctors.
I got a job! I work at Sears now, as a cashier. Its not going to be too bad, I don't think. Everyone seems nice, although its a little odd to see the behind the scenes, business aspect of everything. But, I'm getting paid (I'm opening a direct deposit account soon) and I get a dandy discount, so its nice. My second day is tomorrow. I think I'm actually working the floor a little bit, which should be a nice start. I'm just excited to be doing something.
Footloose was amazing. It went smoothly, and everyone seemed to enjoy it (and, according to Hogan, he enjoyed it to. That was a good thing). I'm doing straight acting again next year, because I need some BHS stuff for college, and I want to get back into the acting part. I want to double major with acting in college, so its important that I do a lot of it. Unfortunatly, although I LOVE dancing and singing, there is no future in it for me. I'm an actress. It has my passion and love, and I feel so comfortable doing it. I of course will be doing summer camps. We're doing Chicago this summer. I'm SO excited I can't even explain. It starts the 11th. I can't wait, honestly. I love to dance, and thats basically what summer camp is all about. And I love performing. So its awesome.
I got into AP English and AP Calculus. I got an A in both classes this year (english and math), so that helped. I really want my GPA and class rank to come back really good.
I got invited to a Law conference in DC. My guidance counselor recommended me, and I think it might be a good idea. I want to see what kind of law I could do. I want to do like child advocacy or something, to help the good guys, not to defend the bad. I used to think I could only do defense and protect criminals, but I know better. Law has always been an option, and now I can explore it. The conference is all recommended students, for 5 days in DC during the school year. I'd be able to go and do a bunch of seminars and explore my options, and I really, really want to do it. Its like 1340 bucks, plus travel costs, but there are fundraising and scholarships available, so I think I might do it. My parents are seriously considering it. It'd be really fun.
These last two days have been kind of tough. Ma's going for a test in Boston today, so I'm kind of stressed about that. I'm worried about school next year and college searches and stuff. And I just had a huge fiasco with someone that I really don't want to talk about. It seems like as I get older, things get harder, and I hate that. I used to want to be older, to make my own decisions and run my own life. But as I get there, I see that its not all that great. Sure, its going to be nice to have my own money and be off in the real world, but its going to be so hard.
I just can't wait for the fresh start. To meet people who don't already have expectations. To get out into college, make my own decisions, go where I want when I want, and to gain some independence.
Well, thats it. I'm tired. I want to shop. And I need to hang out with my friends.

After prom was great. Didn't really sleep much.



I realized today (well not just today, but started to think about it) that I don't really know where I stand with people anymore. I used to be so sure about things. Who was a friend to me, who I couldn't stand, and who I wanted to be around. But now I feel like either I'm completely changing or they are. I hate being confused about people. People I've been friends with forever I barely talk to anymore. People I thought were new friends and great friends seem like they're holding back. Maybe its just me. Or some irrational thing going on in my head. But I don't get it anymore. I'm getting into my 'wow, i'm alone' frame of mind. It seems like everyone else has someone more important to them in their lives than me. Like I'm just taking a way-back seat to everyone else. And I hate that. I hate feeling like I'm going to be left behind.
It feels like either I don't understand other people or they don't understand me.

So yeah. That was my rant and rave for the evening.
Leave me comments?
Tell me what you think about me? Let me know where you stand?
I really, really need that right now. Even if it sucks. I need to know."

"event","So, I've basically been trying to fit in a life where one can't exist.
Right now, I'm in Once Upon a Mattress, Footloose, I'm trying out for Guys and Dolls, and I'm starting driver's ed in a few weeks.
On top of that, I'm trying to keep my english and math grades A's, and keep my Latin and Physics grade B's. 
And then, I'm having life. Every Sat. night, Sam, Sammie, Griff and I hang out and watch movies and stuff. Its a great time. I love my new quartet. They are cool cats. In fact, I just got back from a fun filled night of exhaustion and Aimee looking WICKED dumb and being weird. Gotta love it.
This is/was my schedule.
Thursdays: Capachione at night
Fridays: Either Capachione, or last night it was Leanne's
Saturday:Capachione 1-6ish (next weekend all day. Its my opening and 2nd show)
Sunday: 1-5 (next weekend its a show) and all of my homework
Monday: School. Right after I have NHS (this week I have music rehearsal for auditions) And that night I have the teaching of choreography at 630, judging at 830 or something
Tuesday: At night, this week, I have the Lead auditions. I'm not gonna get a part, but I figure what the hell.
Wednesday: My one and only day off

And then it repeats. Minus the abnormal stuff. But yeah.

By the way. I'm so weird.



Thats my random update.


And I want to tell you
COME SEE ONCE UPON A MATTRESS at CSPA on the 1st (2:00 and 7:30), 2nd (2:00 i think), 7th(730) and 8th (I think 2 and 7:30)
Tickets are 14 dollars
I get to play a whore
Please come!!!
If you get me the money, I can get you your tickets."

"event","So basically. Valentine's Day sucks.
I woke up this morning really tired. Wore my shirt that said ""Love is like a merry go round. If you stay on long enough you'll throw up a little,"". Yeah. You can tell what my mood was.
And then I got to school. Got to watch couples make out while giving flowers, and see all the dead roses in school (sign much?). 
English teacher was absent. I thought my day was finally looking up. But nope. Not so much. My math teacher was a dipshit. But he always is. But i got a 90 on my first quiz. So I thought that was a good omen too.
But then came Physics. Mr. McCarthy is my least favorite person right now. He came over cuz i didn't get something (that I have never gotten. None of us do. Yet we got a pop quiz on it, although he knows this. He hasn't given it back. But he chooses THIS quiz to not give half credit on). But yeah. He's like 'what don't you get?' So I started pulling out homeworks saying ""This, this this, that whole page, this whole section, all but this one, none of these"" on all the papers. And seeing as I got B's both terms of 1st semester and I have a nice GPA, I'm obviously not quick to be stupid. He's like 'just try'. So as I'm getting more frustrated he's making me feel more stupid. So he decides to hold me after class while I'm out on the way to lunch. He said ""What seems to be the problem"" (he always says that.) So i said that I don't understand any of it. And he said like 10 times, with me disagreeing that 'I have a good brain for Physics and that he <i>knows</i> that I understand it."" Which is bullshit. So I said so, without those words. ""Did you not see the papers I just showed you? I think that getting more than 80% of them wrong, because I have no idea what numbers go where or how to use them, is considered NOT getting it"" were the words I believe I used. And then he tells me again to just keep trying and it will become clear and stuff. And I said ""Not by the test Friday, which, by the way, its quite obvious that myself, nor the majority of the class, is prepared to take if we want a chance of passing,"" and he's like ""Oh, don't worry about it, you'll get it,"" so I said, ""No, I don't think I will,"" and he said ""Trust me,"" and I said, ""Kinda hard,"" so he said again that I'd understand it. So I said, while turning around and leaving in the middle of his talking ""I don't believe I actually will,"". And that was the end of any goodness in my day until I got home
Latin confused the fuck out of me. I have no clue what I'm doing. At all. And I snapped at Sammie, which I felt bad for, but she understands.
Then we did this stupid thing in Gym for MCAS, which annoyed me because it was ALL JUNIORS AND SENIORS DOING IT!!! So that was that. 
I didn't stay after because I was in such a bad mood I couldn't handle dealing with it.
Got home. Got TWELVE letters from colleges. And a Valentine from my sister. Called my mom. Vented to her.
She got home. Gave me adorable presents. And my daddy gave me a stuffed gorrilla that makes noises and has heart boxers on. Which made me smile.
Until some more bad stuff happened that I don't feel like dealing with. Actually, two bad stuffs. That unless you know it isn't your business to know.
All that matters is that, as much as it irks me, as the song goes, I WILL SURVIVE!!

But yeah. Thats basically how my Valentine's Day went. I hate this holiday. And as a lovely girl named Jess said
Roses are red
Violets are blue
If you have a valentine
I hope they give you herpes!
Which all in all makes no sense at all. But whatever. It made me smile!!!


And this was wicked, wicked long. But whatever. I don't care. Deal with it. If you can't stand the letters, get out of my journal.

Leave love."

"event","So.
Since competition i've gotten an ear infection that spread. So I've been sick.
But, while sick I auditioned for Once Upon a Mattress. And got a part.
I'm Lady Mabelle. Greg's character, Sir Harry, gets in a fight with his pregnant girlfriend and takes up with me. I'm French, and can only say 'yes' in English. So yeah. It should be fun. And Theresa said that I'm one of the highlighted dancers in Spanish Panic, the big dance scene. So I'm excited about that!
Footloose auditions weren't fruitful for me. I didn't get anything. But I will live, because I know I auditioned well, so its nothing I could do anything about. So yeah. But I'm wicked happy for Emily and Greg. They got amazing parts!!!
Febfest is starting. Its a little weird, because they are trying to break me out of my honest acting stuff. Like the show we are doing is a comedy, so we're being told to be over the top. So I feel like I'm indicating and overacting. Which is so different than what I'm used to. I'm not too sure about it. Like I feel like I'm doing it wrong when they say I'm doing it right. But its a different style, I guess. I'll deal with it.
I really want to audition for You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown at Massassoit. I'm just worried about how busy my schedule already is. And the fact that I won't get in. Its just the experience of the audition that I want.

So yeah. I'm wicked busy.
Got in a fight w/ my Physics teacher today. That was so fun! (insert sarcastic flip off)

"event","So yea, I'm in Connecticuit right now. And what fun it is.
It actually started amazing. I took the ride in with Greg and his mom. We had a blast. Except for when I took his picture and he stole my camera and i almost broke his finger. Then he almost broke mine when i got it back. Yeah. But we had a blast.
Then we watched all the performances. EVERYONE was amazing. I think i peed from laughing at Maloney, just a trickle. And Emily's solo was A-FRIEKIN-MAZING. And so was Sweeney's. And CJ made me tear up a bit.
Yeah.
And then I went back and ate dinner in my room. :-/. Chicken fingers and fries. Only thing i really ate all day.
Then awards. Which made Maloney a bawling mess, because she got Platinum (the highest award) and 1st place in her division. WHICH IS AMAZING! I am so proud of her!
Then we went to Emily's room to chill. I got a headache.
Then the real not fun part started.
I woke up around 7 with like acid build up of something. Took pepto and tums and it wouldn't go away. Then around 8:30 I got sick. Really sick. Which woke my sister up. Who woke my mom up. So I got in bed and had some pepto. Got sick again. And then I was fine for a bit. I started to get nauseous again, which I knew was a bad sign. I couldn't even keep down water. And I was dry heaving. Which sucked.
So, I had my mom call the ER to see how long the wait was. And they told her to take me to the immediate care center in the hospital. I got out of bed to go and made it to the door and had to curl up on the floor. She called for a wheel-chair. That took 10 minutes to get there. Yeah, love hotel service, don't you? So they wheeled me down to the car, drove me there. I waited for like 15 minutes, then they made me get up and stand on a scale. I almost passed out on the way. And the second I sat down, I got sick again. Which was retarded, cuz there was nothing in my system.
So, they gave me meds for the nausea. As I'm leaving, I get to the door and collapse in a chair. My entire arms went numb, and my fingers wouldn't uncurl. My face went almost gray and I couldn't open my eyes. It was like I could hear everything going on around me, but I couldn't say or do anything. It was on of the scariest things of my life. 
Somehow they got me in a wheelchair and broughtme back to the room, covered me in blankets, and stuck me w/ an IV. Yeah. One of the most painful things in the world. I almost passed out just from that.
While I had the IV in i kept crying, 1-from being sick and 2-because all of my competition stuff was that day. If I wasn't out in time, I would have missed Emily and Greg. Which I was looking forward to. And then there was all my group numbers. So tara called me and told me I didn't have to do any of it if I didn't feel up to it. I cried.

And guess what? I GOT THROUGH IT ALL! I almost threw up a couple times before I got onstage, but I did it. During Star Spangled Banner I almost passed out from sheer exhaustion, and lack of anything in my system. But I finished, all through Wicked. We did Fame (Gold Trophy), Sweet Charity (High Gold), Seussical (High Gold), Footloose (Platinum), Star Spangled Banner (Platinum) and Wicked (Platinum). We did amazing. I am so proud of myself and of my group. Myself for getting through everthing. I got off after Wicked, and started sobbing on Maloney, because I finished everything. Then I sobbed on mom. I was just so happ that I got past all of what I went through and finished. And my group had to conform to a few things because of me, mainly the lift in Fame. Cheralyn had to do it for me.
All in all, yesterday was one of the scariest things in my entire life. I thought that the second I sat in that chair and passed out thatI was in deep shit. But I did it!
And I realized how close everyone in CSPA is. Because I have people I don't know offering help and assistance if I need it. Parents I don't know are asking if I'm okay. Students I don't know are asking how I am. I think that helped me get through everything.

Well, I was going to write about Competition and all that. But I'll get to it later...

I just realized something. If I get into Competition at BHS, I can't do Capachione this year. Because its all at the same time. I'll go to 45 minutes of class and need to leave. And I need a job. So basically, depending on whether I get into BHS competition, which I really, really, really want, I can't do Capachione. I'll end up one of those random summer camp people. And it tears me up. I hate the thought of not going there every week. Not dancing up a storm. Not being with all the people I've grown up with. I grew up at Capachione. This is my seventh year. I've taken classes, from voice, to acting, to dance, to all three. I don't remember not having Capachione. A ton of my friends are there. It feels like a family to me. I don't want to have to leave. But I might. I need a job. I need to take Driver's Ed. I want to audition for Massassoit stuff. I can't do any of that right now. I need to focus on my future. But I really, really want to do Capachione. But I can't very well make my parents pay for it when I can't go. Or ruin it for everyone else when i don't go for 3 months then suddenly show up and expect to be included. It just isn't fair.
So depending on what Mr. Hogan decides, I'm going to end up just going in the summer...
I hate this...All this complicated stuff.


On the other hand, I am having the time of my life doing Competition. I love it. Its hard this year, takes a lot of energy. I had to work this time. Its one of the most challenging things I've done, between the choreography and the energy. I honestly have no idea how I'm pulling half of it off. 
But I'm wicked nervous. I'm in the front a lot. If I mess up, the judges will ALL see it. Every last one of them. I want to do well. I want to see Capachione at the top. I want to blow them all away.
And I know we can. We are awesome. We're all pulling together. We can do it.


Maybe I'll go to bed now. But then again, maybe not. I can't decide."

Ummm Hannuka was fun. Since it was basically all of vacation.
I got my hair straightener :-). I love it. Got a bunch of socks. Some perfume. Books. calander. A game. Sweatshirts. A robe. makeup stuff. Johnny Depp pictures. FAME. Urinetown (haha greg). and other things.
My Aunts house on Xmas was a good time. It was relaxing. And the food was delishious. 
New Year's at Leanne's was alright. Neither of us particularly loved it. Seeing 5 couples sit around you and make out isn't exactly me definition of a good time. And then there was Drama. But whatev.
Her me and griff got together a couple times. One of them we made cookies and such. The other night we went to see The Producers. ITS A-FRIEKING-MAZING!! Funniest movie I've ever seen. ASnd we had chinese food. Visited Nick's grave and wished him a happy new year.
Competition is in 10 days. I am so excited, but so nervous. I just dance in it, so I'm not spotlighted or anything, but some of the stuff is hard. And I'm in the front a lot, so if I screw up, its easy to spot. And its my last competition w/ Capachione, so I'm kind of sad. But yeah. I still need to get all my costumes together. And we're working on sweet Charity on thursday. Oh joy...lolz. I'm just hoping that greg and i don't burst out laughing and can do it seriously during competition. Its a little weird. I mean, we're wicked close friends. And us two having to do that 'sexily and lustfully'. yeah. awkward central. But I think we are both good enough actors that we can handle it. Right, Greg?
I went to NH yesterday to visit my mom's best friend and her family. I might be going to Martha's Vineyard w/ them for a week this summer. They usually take a babysitter w/ them so if they go out at night alone they can spend time together w/out the kids and stuff. And they have the cutest 2 yr old I've EVER seen. I swear, I almost took him home with me. So yeah. A week in Martha's Vineyard for free, with a very awesome family. I definitely wouldn't mind that.
And today is a snow day. Ick. I hate snow.
And now I'm missing a day of my summer."

Yeah its me. Hmm
Friday-I have no idea what I did. I think i stayed home.
Saturday-Superbowl!! WE WON! It was an amazing game.
          Then that night, Maloney, Maurath, Kayla and Jimmy came over to hang out. We had a ton of fun. The reading was wicked funny. Although they tore my room apart. And were mean. But whatever. Then Maloney slept over. It was fun. We watched SNL. And some Mad TV
Sunday-Rehearsal. It was good, the first half. The second not so good. But its all fixed now.
Monday-Um... I went home sick. Between cramps and nausea I felt like I was going to pass out. So I spent the day doing homework.
Tuesday-School, although I didn't want to. And a ton of HW.
Today-I made up a quiz after school from yesterday. Mom called the dr.
Thursday and Friday I have rehearsals, the the 'Holiday' Concert on Saturday.

Monday, I think, I have a doctor's appointment. I'm not really looking forward to that. I'm probably going to end up talking about stuff I don't feel like talking about. And all that crap. Yeah.

A lot of people don't understand limits I have, but it all has to do with past stuff. Broken trust. Stuff I wish i could go back and change. Some people don't see it as a big deal. Because nothing actually happened. But they don't get it..."

I somehow ended up with a 68 on the History test I earned like a 2 on. He graded them some weird way. No one really knows how.
FebFest meeting. That was mandatory. So I went. Along with half of LMB (improv group. the half that started it)
Then tried to go to improv. TRIED being the key word. We all got there. Only for this convo to happen.
Ms. B-Where have you all been?
Me or Maloney-Febfest meeting.
Ms. B-What?
Me or Maloney-For the Drama Club show. It was mandatory. We had to go.
Ms. B-Goodbye.
Maloney-Fine.
Me-Whatever.
*storm out*
*rest of LMB follows*
Yeah. turns out she was upset that we went to drama club instead. But thats not fair. There would be no LMB without drama.
Oh well. She will get a bunch of upset hormonal teenagers next week. Whatever. She'll live.

Yeah. Aimee is angry.
And I had a voice lesson, last minute, half asleep. And for some reason, nothing was working. I could tell Craig was frustrated. I for whatever reason wasn't releasing the breath right. And when I told him it was a comfort thing he had nothing to say to it. I ended up getting in the car and crying. Because I'm mad at myself. And frustrated. I will never have a chance at a lead, anywhere.

But. In good news. Maloney's mom is ordering the Wicked tickets soon :-)

Like, you thought you liked this one person so much that thats the only person you could think about?
But then you start spending time with someone you previously liked, and those feelings rush back.

1. I love lobster. 
2. I hate fake people with fake hair and fake opinions. 
3. I hate conformists. 
4. Sometimes I act different around guys I like. 
5. People intimidate me. 
6. I have a lot of bad memories. 
7. Things that people said to me in Jr. High still hurt today. 
8. I've never had a crush on a teacher. 
9. My middle name is Nicole. 
10. I have really bad lower abdominal pains and no one knows why. 
11. I think the only medical thing that hasn't been done to me in the past is surgery. 
12. I have really protective parents. 
13. I was in a really, really, really minor car accident today. 
14. I hate having crushes on people. 
15. Even more I hate when those crushes confuse you and start to change...back into old ones. 
16. I have a really hard time trusting people. 
17. I have an even harder time trusting guys. Too many have tried to take advantage of me. 
18. I've only been in love once before. 
19. I LOVE TO FLIRT! 
20. I don't particularly like myself. 
21. If I wasn't myself, I wouldn't ever hang out with me. 
22. Stupid comments annoy me. Especially when they come from stupid people. 
23. Sometimes I put up an away message to avoid talking to people. 
24. I hate petty girls that are way too judgemental to live in America. 
25. Racism is stupid. 
26. I support same-sex marriages. I support my friends. 
27. I don't support drinking. At all. In fact, I'm highly against it.

33. I really, really want my new room. 
34. My biggest fear is that I will never get married, have kids, and that I'll always be alone. 35. I never want to step foot on a plane again. But I probably will. By force. 
36. I get nervous when I'm acting and singing in front of friends. 
37. I hate not being in control. And I hate not knowing what people think of me. 
38. I don't trust anyone 100 percent. Including my family. Even though I should. 
39. I have hurt myself in the past. 
40. I don't ever feel like the most important person to anyone. Ever. Everyone else has someone they could rely on if I wasn't there."

Basically sums up my life right now.
The guy I like is clueless. He isn't getting ANY hints. And he seems to be afraid of getting hurt. According to Tim I picked the hardest guy.
I'm going through some health stuff.
I'm overall not in a great mindset.
School is really hard this year. Basically, my grades are straight Bs or B-s. And thats not good enough for me. Not this year. I need to make up for last year.
Friend stuff is weird right now. I'm going through some weirdness with a few friends. Not sure how to deal with some of it.

But, on the upside, I'm now an assistant director at Capachione.
And Competition is amazing.

Thursday is Yom Kippur.
Wednesday is Weird People's birthday. And Caity's.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to you both!

And I realised today how much I miss my Leanne. Brockton needs its weird people!"

COMMENT!

When it comes to guys` you like... 

Hair:: Enough to play with.
Eyes :: I like entrancing eyes. Eyes that make you want to look into them.
Best physical feature :: Eyes.
Best personality attribute :: They need to be able to show everyone how much they love me. If they are scared to show me that they care, its not worth it
Style :: Anything. As long as they are clean. And themselves.
Eating habits ::  Good table manners
Musical tastes :: No hard rock or wicked bad rap
Height :: Taller than me. But that doesn't take much.
Weight :: More than me, but not by like 100 lbs or anything. Because that would be a wicked lot.
Talents :: Acting, kissing, flirting. (those are all talents)
Hobbies ::  Acting and performing.


--This or That-- 
Older or Younger?? Well. Tim was younger. And the guy I like is younger. So younger
Romantic or Horndog?? Romance for the most part. Sometimes horndog is called for.
Smart or Stupid?? Intelligent, but says stupid, silly things.
Fat or Skinny?? Neither. Too skinny is a turn off. Like, if i joke around and call you skinny, its a good thing. But if I dont call you on how thin a guy is, then its not necessarily a good skinny.
Skinny but Muscular or Big and Muscular?? Skinny and muscular
Punk or Preppy??  I love eyeliner. Makes me smile and say PWAH! but other than that, It doesn't matter .I'll date a prep. Or anything.
The Big Picture or the Little Things?? Little things. They make the big picture
Flowers/Candy or Big Expensive Present?? Flowers/Candy
Mixtape or Burned CD?? Well a burned cd that has the essence of a mixtape. CDs are more convenient, and if it has the same thought put into it as a tape its good.
Love or Lust?? Love mostly. But if a guy isn't lusting, that takes the fun out. A relationship has to involve love, but has to also have at least a little physicality.
Emotional or Just Not?? Emotional...but not overly. I need a shoulder to cry on(or get damp)
Sincere or Jokester?? A sincere guy that knows when we can joke
Hott and mean or Ugly and sweet?? Ugly and sweet. Because even ugly people can pose some kind of attraction. But mean isn't something I would want to fall in love with.
Sexy or Just ""cute""?? Cute, with little tints of sexy.
Arse or Abs?? Ass. I love bums. But having at least tight abs doesn't hurt any.
Hair or Hands?? Hair. I love playing with it. But then again, I love playing with a guys hands.
Dimples or Eyes?? Eyes. I love eyes. I can fall in love just because of someone's eyes. you can tell emotion by looking in eyes.
Biceps or Calves/Thighs?? Biceps. I like to feel safe in a guys arms.
Teeth or Nose(some people are just wierd)?? Nose. It can't be too huge. Or too gross. But teeth have ot be at least clean.
Clean Shaven or Scruffy??  Clean Shaven. Its no fun kissing with stubble on their face
Rugged or Prim and Proper?? A little of both.
Countryboy or Cityboy?? Cityboy
Date alone or With Friends?? Date alone. Definitely.
Mama's Boy or Rebel Without A Cause?? Neither. Too dependant on the mommy isn't good. But neither is wicked bad boy.

--Have You Ever--
Dumped a guy because he liked you too much?? Not really.
Loved a guy because he stalked you?? No.
Loved a guy because he hated you?? Nope
Lead a guy on for kicks?? No. I would never, ever do that.
Asked a guy out purely because he was hott?? Nope
Flirted with guys even though you had a boyfriend?? Yes. I am a born flirt. But I flirt more with guys I like
Lied about not having a boyfriend?? never
Lied about having one??  No. Except when I was wicked little and used to tell people i did. But I was like 5
Cheated?? I would never, ever cheat. But I have been the object someone tried to cheat WITH. I turned it down though. Of course.
Been Cheated on?? Not that I know of. But hey, who truly knows?
Had a crush on a gay guy?? Yes ma'am.

--Their Clothing(yes/no)--

Independent/DC?? ummm
Skavenger/UGP?? sure why not? if i knew what these were...

Jeans or Shorts?? Mostly jeans. But shorts are cool too

--Be Honest--
Would you ever date a guy for his money?? No
Would you ever date a guy for his social status?? No
Have you ever liked hanging out with your bf's friends more than him?? Not really. Only like one of the people. But not hang out in the same way.
Have you ever pretended to like somebody to make them feel better?? No.
Have you called a girl a whore, when you were screwing lots of guys?? No. I couldn't. I don't screw, never mind screw around.
Do looks matter?? Sort of. If they are completely unnattractive to ME, then I don't want to date them. There has to be some kind of an attraction for me to date them. And they need to be clean. And smell good. I love guys who smell nice. If I tell you that you smell good, you're in.
Are you honestly scared of being dumped??  Right now? No.
Does size matter?? Um if its not 2 inches. Then thats fine. But around there, that might be a little boring if anything ever really happened.
Do you avoid 'situations'? Sometimes. But not really. I just don't really get myself in a position where there would be a situation. But thats not like concious.
Are you ashamed to be seen with your ugly friends?? No.
Are you ashamed for being ashamed?(you better be)?? I'm not.
Do you hide things from your crushes/guy friends/bf?? Yes. Who doesn't?
Do you really want a guy to say if those jeans make your butt look fat? No. I hate when people think I'm fat. But if I ask if it looks good, and it doesn't, tell me.
Are you dissapointed when your bf doesn't say I love you right away?? No. But if they never say it, it kind of makes me a little upset. 
Wanna be a virgin till marriage?? At this point, yes.
Do you really love the guys everytime that you say it?? Yes
Do you dream about your crushes/bfs/guy friends?? Yes. lolz.
Would you makeout with a guy friend just to get it over with/curiosity? Sure. Definitely. Making out is fun. And if your guy friend is cool enough for it, sure! Why the hell not?"

Bad stuff--
Well, as in my previous entry, Shana passed away. I miss her. The house feels empty. Every so often I go to pet her on the head or take her out, then remember I can't.
I went to school Tuesday morning only to find out that Griff's cousin, and my friend, Nick, had passed away from a heroine overdose that morning. He was only 20. That was hard. At the wake, I met Griff's family, and was touched because Griff's mom gave me a huge hug and said ""I'm sorry about Shana. And about your great-grandmother. Its been a rough summer for you.' Meanwhile, here she is, going through such a huge thing. And Griff was rubbing my back comforting me. I felt like I should have been doing that for him.
Saturday was the Funeral. That was one of the hardest things I have ever done. While we were there, all the memories about James, Meme're, Pepe're, Shana, Nick....everything...just came at me at once. I couldn't stop crying. It was literally the worst moment of my life. Feeling all of that loss and anger and sadness at once isn't good for anyone.



Better stuff-
I called the Randolph Animal Hospital (place where Shana used to go) and starting Friday/Saturday (hopefully) I'm going to start putting in volunteer time. I can't be away from animals that long. I need them in my life. And I'm going to have them in my life.
Today, I GOT MY PERMIT!! Thats right, stay off the roads. And I drove. Did pretty well if I do say so myself. So there.


Leave me lovies."

My dog, Shana, passed away around 12:30 today. My sister came to dismiss me so I could go with her to the animal hospital to say goodbye. I never got to. My dad called her to let her know it was too late. She had seizures this morning. My sister saw them all. Then my parents came and took her to the hospital.
I miss her so much. She's like a member of my family. A sister. We got her when I was 2. I don't remember any time WITHOUT her. I was too young to remember before her. Now I have to have an after her.
Yea, I know she's a dog and that dogs die. But to me, she wasn't a dog. She was a person. I call her a person.
And I feel worse for Ma. Now she's home alone most of the time. Well, starting in January. Shana was her best friend.
I hope she knew how much we loved her."

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993399>First Period-Sociology/Anthropology with mr szachowicz. Not bad, since I've known him for going on 4 years. So he knows me and how I work through National History Day. But he decides 'i'm just not going to call Aimee in attendance since i know shes here'. for some reason that was irritating. But I think I'm going to like that class (Being opinionated is a must! lolz works for me!) And Sammie is in there. We prob won't be able to stay next to each other though.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993399>Period 2-Study. Boring. Haven't had acting yet. But I met they guy after school. He seems really cool. I'll like it!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993399>Period 3-Physics. I'm going to hate it. With a passion. A quiz a week, 3 exams a term, HW almost every night. He has a lisp. Speach really affects me, and it affects whether I like a class or not. But yet again, my friend Sammie was in that class :-) and we are assigned next to each other. So it worked out very well :-). But yea. the guy can't even say the name of the subject he teaches.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993399>Lunch-2 people I really talk to in 1st lunch. But after Sr. Priv. Griff is going to be wicked cool and sit with me :-)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993399>Period 4-Stress Management. AHHHH. The lady is annoying. But I sit in front of Robbie Baker so it can't be too bad. Its someone I at least kind of know that I can sit near, cuz we did febfest together 2 years ago. So hopefully that will at least offset the fact that the teacher is annoying.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993399>Period 5-Yea, I don't think it will be too bad. We had to seat ourselves reverse alphabetically, so yea...It was basically me, angela, and amanda organizing. But it was cool stuff. We did it right. I don't think I'll mind that class TOO much.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993399></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993399>Then Leanne picked me griff and melissa up and we went to her house. We hung out, went to visit Ben at Petsmart. He tried to pull a 'Scotty doesn't know"" in the middle of the parking lot. I turned it down lolz. Then we ran into RJ and he might have my gym class :-). I might not be alone. So then we gave him a ride home. Then we went to Walmart so leanne could look for curtains but she didnt find any, but a weird old pedophile guy was getting wayyyy too close to me. And he 'happened' to leave the store at the same time we were. EWWW</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993399>So we went back to leannes and ben showed up. We played the question answer game. Fun stuff. And Ben was WICKED weird. lolz. What else is new. lolz. Thats why we love him. If he wasn't strange he wouldn't be Ben!</FONT></STRONG></P>

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000>Its so sad! Today is the last day of summer :-/</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000>Its so weird. Last year I started the school year caring so much about what kind of an impression I would make on the school. This year, I care about what kind of impression the school will make on me. I'm myself now. I'm dressing in the clothes I want, wearing the shoes I want, having horrible hair (that i didn't want, but a friend convinced me to wear it like i own it :-) ), and being the person I want. I have the friends I want, although some of them are miles and hours away, and I am doing the things I want. Competition (hopefully at BHS as well as CSPA), musical (BHS and CSPA), taking the classes I, for the most part, got to pick for myself, and I'm finally becoming more free. I'm getting my permit sometime in the next week or so, so I will be able to drive for myself. I hate giving up control, so thats a big step in gaining some.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000>Last year was one of the best of my life, but at the same time one of the worst. I met Tim, who was a huge influence on me. I learned who I really am. I lost a couple friends, but at the same time gained a bunch more. I went through a lot of first, yet still stayed true to myself. I learned what the word 'no' meant, and that when you say 'no', you stick to it. I learned what love was. Then I learned what heartbreak was. I learned that when I am being true to myself, I am happiest. I learned that if I let my parents guide me and follow everything they say, I will never make my own mistakes. If I don't make my own mistakes, I will never learn from them. I learned to stick up for myself. I learned that I can't do something or be with someone just to make them happy. I need to do what makes &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; happy. I learned that slacking off doesn't pay. I learned that I don't need someone standing next to me whispering encouraging things in my ear to make me feel like a worthwhile person. Last summer I learned that we are not invincible (RIP James. You and your smile will not be forgotten). And I learned that if we don't take risks, we will never get anywhere in life.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000>I'm going into this year with more courage and more enthusiasm than I have ever gone with before. I chose my classes (well, except for math and english :-/), I am choosing my friends, and more importantly, I am choosing to be me. Thats all that matters.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000>And I know that I always will have shoulders to lean on. Thanks for being there for me, guys. I don't know what I'd do without you.</FONT></STRONG></P>

Just a cheap suit?
Something that you could replace?
Good for one thing, 
To wear and to tear?
Thats how I feel,
Thats what you did to me.
You settled for cheap,
When you wanted expensive.
When the suit is worn out,
You get the next on the rack.
If you hadn't gotten me,
It would have just been one less cheap suit,
To add to the collection.

"event","A lot has happened in the past few days.

Fame was AMAZING. We did wonderful, at least I think so. I'm wicked proud of everyone! I think this was one of my better shows lolz.
After Fame we went to Christos. Rob and I spooned a bit. (haha) We actually go asked if we did anything. Oh and a couple people asked if Greg and I dated lolz. And he and I matched so we got that a lot. Twas weird. But Christos wasn't one of the funner experiences I've had there.
We went to Emily's house and hung out with some of they guys for a bit. Then they went home and the girls sat around and talked. Emilys cat woke me up by sitting on my chest and staring at me. Then it curled in a ball and started purring for like an hr. Then it jumped on emily and back onto me. Then started to chew on Maloney's toe.
Sunday was my SWEET 16! IT WAS A BLAST!!! Haha I rocked walla-balla strap on. :-) I'm better with my balls than the boys who have them! I got 6 :-) don't be jealous. Umm The apple game was fun too. It ended up being me, sam, and angela who rocked that one. Rob gave me a spoon :-) I saved it lolz. Sweeney got me scratch tickets, but I was unlucky. lol. My parents dance and were wicked cute. Ben and I danced and it was fun and silly. Rob and I danced and we were weird. We did the Fame dances and kicked ass. Will ate all of the beef teriyaki. That was poop. Ummm. Emily was forced to wear a skirt, but she looked great lolz. We limbo'd and I shimmied with the best of them. It was dandy. But I lost really badly. Gasse kicked my ass to timbuck two.
Then everyone left and Ben, Emily, Colleen, Sweeney, Alexis, Maloney, and I all went back to my house and chilled. 
I BELTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Out Here On My Own was belted by Aimee Nicole Eaton!!!!!! SO EXCITED! Thats my competition audition song now :-) I'm wicked pumped.I was jumping up and down.
We went to bed at lyk 3 or 4. Then we woke up and hung out and stuff. Everyone but Maloney left at lyk 1230. Maloney left at like 3. 
Then I went to Leanne's house for her goodbye barbeque. We played an interesting game of never have I ever and truth or dare. And we then played with John on the phone, which was quite interesting cuz hes a spaz. Then I went home.
Last night I went minigolfing with greg and jess wicked last minute cuz I was uber bored and lonely! And they had asked me to hang out the night before so we made up for it. Twas insane. And we got these really good slushed and Greg inhaled his while Jess and I ate like ladies. HAHA! And we talked about people. ""They have friends. They're just not me."" lolz.

I have no idea whats going on with today. 

Well, thats about it. 

My official birthday is in 6 days :-)"

Give Pepere a big hug for me and steal some of the nuts from his jar. I know he still has some.

"event","Hate...its such a strong word...But I feel it right now..
My Great Grandmother, basically my grandmother, is dying right now from cancer. And we JUST found out. And she's staying with her daughter to die at home, instead of in a hospital. My dad's Uncle called and told us what was happening. My dad called Memere's daughter to get directions to their house so we could say goodbye, and they wont FUCKING let us see her.
This woman is one of the greatest women alive. She virtually was my father's mother. She and Pepere (who also died of cancer when I was 8) were the only ones who supported my parent's marriage. Although we aren't related by blood, she is my grandmother. She has always been there for me, and I can't stand the thought of not being there for her. If it were me in her shoes she would be living by my bed. But I can't have 10 minutes to say goodbye.
I can honestly say I have never hated anyone in my life. But I hate them right now. All of the people who are keeping us from seeing her. I hope they rot in hell.
And Memere will be in heaven with Pepere, sitting together in perfect harmoney watching over their family. 
I love her so much...I don't want her to go...
And I feel like shit because mom told me I should give her a call and say hello (before we found out she had taken a turn for the worst) and I didn't...I said I would and I never did...And I ruined my last chance to talk to her...I feel like the worst person alive.

Warning:My party date will also probably be changing. I'm talking to mom about it tomorrow."

Just wanted to leave you with something before I went to Carver.

Oh, and to let you know that my new voice song, if Craig agrees, will be 'Out Here On My Own' because it is officially my range.

MEXICO: Twas fun. First i got a really, really bad case of strept throat. I lived on Jello for 3 days, and i got this weird rash along with it. But yes, I officially hate airplanes. My ears popped for an entire day, and we hit a huge air pocket that scared the shiz out of me. While we were there, it was cool. I wet jet skiing, watched my sister and Matt parasail, went swimming in the ocean (that was like 80 degrees) and the pool (that was basically body temperature). Got a cool tan. We found a hard rock cafe (im wearing the shirt right now). All I really bought for myself was shirts. lolz. So clever of me. On the way home my ears popped again. Took roughly a day and a half to unpop this time. And they hurt like hell. Hmmmm... Oh, and there was immense amounts of drama.

Camp: You all know how this started--tons of dissappointment. But now I am having a blast! It is so much fun, and the dancing is actually challenging this year. WOOHOO!

So yes--Wednesday after camp a bunch of us went to Becky's house to swim. That was fun. Until Rob practically killed me. But I forgave him.
Last night a bunch of us went to the Rox game. Twas fun. Until a bug landed on my chin (beetle), then fell on my shirt. I went to hit it, and it fell in my shirt. More specifically, my right bra cup, where i proceeded to squish it while trying to get it out. I was pulling beetle legs out of my bra. That was disgusting.

And yesterday, I also made the decision to leave the Color Guard squad. Yes, I know, very unlike me. But I realized a few things. 
1-I need to get a job. It is very unfair to make my parents keep paying for all of Capachione while I could very well be earning at least a portion of my own way. So I have decided I need to do that much at least, because Competition is expensive as shiz.
2-I can't juggle Capachione's Comeptition, The Production Class, Musical at BHS, Possibly Competition at BHS, and Febfest at BHS, along with Improv and not to mention SCHOOL, while holding a job and doing Color Guard. 
3-I realized that most of the fun came out of Leanne and Nicole doing the squad last year. And they aren't anymore, because they graduated. 

Ultimately, Mrs. Villani isn't mad. But my family is. They lost 'respect' for me. But it was something that I needed to do. Since I was little I have always been told 'You shouldn't do stuff if it isnt fun for you'. And it stopped being fun. So I'm not doing it. I'm doing what gives me the most joy--Theatre. Thats what I need, and thats what I'm doing. In order to do that, I have chosen to get a job. I have to pay for Capachione, along with the car I am hoping to buy next summer. It probably won't be my mom's anymore. I'm thinking about getting a small car now.

I'm excited though--Next weekend equals Carver with a bunch of my friends. My mom finally decided to let me go. I'm very excited.

"event","So yes, story of my life--I get to feel untalented.
Fame got casted today. And I am so proud of all of my friends that got parts.
Unfortunately, after 6 years of being there, seems like I'm destined to be a one hit wonder. Yea, no part for Aimee. I wanted one of the parts so bad. Argh...it was basically like the role of my life. AKA it was basically the story of my life. But whatever. I didn't get it.
I just don't like how some of it was unfair. Granted, everyone who got the parts will probably be great. I mean, they were last year. But last year, everyone who got a part worked their asses off for it. Thats all I'm saying about that.
I'm just sick of feeling untalented. I worked my ASS off. I danced as hard as I could. I even got put into a special group of dancers. The role I wanted was a dancer. I read for the role like 5 times between today and yesterday. And I know I rocked. Because I could feel it. My singing audition was alright. It was by far the best I have had yet. All people were telling me was that I have improved so much. But nobody will ever get to hear that unless they happen to be in an audition with me. Because I am destined to be in the background.
When parts were announced, I was so happy for some of my friends. Some got dream roles. Others got roles that they didn't want, but SHOULD be happy with. Even though most of them aren't. At least they got parts.
I went into the lobby area and just sat on the couch. Then I went back into the room. Colin saw I was upset and wrapped me in a HUGE hug, and I started to cry. Then Emily grabbed me in super-de-dooper hug and I started to sob. I wanted it so bad. I thought that this would be my year. I need a part that is harder for me. I need a real chance to act and show off. That would have been it.
And I need to hear from people that don't have to tell me I'm good.  Because everyone who has told me is a friend or someone who can't tell me if I suck. But I like the feeling of having a random person come up to me after the show and say I did wonderful. After Grease, some random person came up to me and said 'I saw you dance. You lit up the stage,'. That's the best feeling. But no one outside my cluster said anything to me. I want to believe I did so well. I really want to. But I can't.


On the upside--I half got what I wanted. I got put into the dance department. Fame is split into three groups--Music, Acting, and Dance. And I got Dance. Everyone in that group has talent, so I feel really great about myself being one of them. The downside--a lot of it is ballet. I need to learn ballet quick. lol. But I get to wear leg warmers and that fun stuff.

I will get over this. I always do. And camp is always AMAZING. So next week, when I tell you how much of a blast I'm having, it will be because I got over the sting. I always have, and I always will. And I will never give up.

Who knows, maybe in two years I will score a lead in a BHS show. Then I won't ever feel down or depressed again.
All I ask is a call back next year.


For now, I need to be uplifted. So please, if you care, leave love. About anything. It doesn't matter. Just leave something.

Love,
Aimee.



ALSO---CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE WHO GOT A PART!!"

So a lot has happened.
Monday, I went to Griff's Grandfather's wake, in order to support Griff. Leanne picked me up and she and I said the Mourner's Kaddish over the casket. It brought back memories from James' wake. It was hard. Because I kept envisioning James lying there. Griff, I'm glad that Leanne and I managed to get a smile out of you. I'm sorry. I wish I had some way to make you feel better.
I went to the Emergency Room for the second time in a month and a half. I had called my dr that morning, because i thought i was getting another sinus infection. But then I got this really gross rash all over me, and it started to itch. So we thought it was hives. A few years ago (almost 3 to the day) I got hives that lasted for 3 months all over me. So my dad brought me to the ER (at almost 7:30) to get a benadryll shot. We waited almost 3 hours to get a room. Then the doctor came in for about 5 minutes and told me I had strep (after waiting in the room for half an hour). So he leaves to write a prescription, which we wait another half hour for. Then the girl comes in with the prescription. And I find out that its rare to get a rash with the strep. Figures. All the weird stuff I get. 3 months of hives for apparently NO reason, Bells Palsey, unknown cause. Rash, which is very rare. Sinus Infections/Bronchitis every couple months. Why, i ask you.
So yesterday, i spent the day on the couch in agony. It literally felt like knives were stabbing me in the throat. I was miserable. And starving. Because all I had was Jello and popsicles. And I had to chew the jello. How pathetic is that?
Today was better. My nose is stuffy as hell, but other than that, I'm feeling better. But I have this gross taste in the back of my throat. I'm hoping thats normal (anyone know?). 

I need to find an audition song for Fame before I leave. I'm so excited about camp! But there are WAY too many people doing it (42) AHHH!!!

I'm going to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico in 4 (count them) (I'll do it for you 1-2-3-4) days!!!!!!
I am extatic(sp?). I have never been anywhere remotely as cool as Mexico. I'm going for 8 days with My mom, my dad, samantha, and matty walsh. It shall be amazingly awesome.
Except for the flying thing. I'm terrified to fly. It shall be INCREDIBLY scary!!!! I hate heights. And I hate not being in control.

Well, thats it for now.

Leave me love. I need it.

"event","Well, another school year over.
And with it, a relationship with someone who had been the most important person in my life for a period of time earlier this year. But I figure, it is not my job to tolerate more lies. I am STILL finding out lies. Like that the first few weeks of the relationship were lies, because he liked someone else. And that the first time he told me he loved me, he still had feelings for her. So the first time and last time he ever told me 'I love you' were lies. I'm really, really doubting the time in the middle.
But I'm not going to pretend to give a shit. Because I really don't. I don't hate him. I would help him if he needed me. I really should be of the feeling that if I saw him bleeding on the street I'd spit on him, but frankly, that would be a lie. In between and/or during the lies, he helped me become myself more than anyone else has. He's the reason I finally stood up for myself this time. So I guess I owe him something. But if he ever needed me, I would be there in a second. Because thats the kind of person I am.
Some other stuff with people got straightened out.
And other stuff is getting weird. Thats what happens when you make a mistake I guess.

I would like to say this--I am happily single. I am planning on staying that way for a little bit. It is what I need right now. I need to be JUST friends with some guys. Because I need to trust that guys can be honest again. And not have any other intentions other than caring about me. So I am staying solo for a bit. Flirting around. Being myself. Its what I do. And I haven't really found the person that I can be with and STILL be myself. When I do, I will let you all know!! I promise!

With that said...

This year has been so weird. But it has been the best yet.
Its weird because the people that I owe the biggest thanks to I also owe the biggest punch in the face to. And its weird because a few people who I thought would be there with me until we grew old are no longer there. And that used to hurt. But I realised that I have what I need right now. No less. No more. Granted, those people were HUGE parts of my life for so long, but my life is no worse. I don't know where I'd be right now if we were still friends. I probably wouldn't be great friends with Vickie and Sammi. And I wouldn't have come into myself as much. 
Everything that has happened this year has truly shaped who I am. Some of the worst stuff has happened, but some of the best stuff has happened at the same time. Everyone contributed to that.

I have discovered that I like myself. This is the first year that I've been able to say that after. But I really do. I am comfortable with how I look. And I know I'm not ugly. I'm a little overweight, but not enough to be considered fat. And more importantly, I am a nice person. I am never truly downright mean to anyone on purpose. I try to help people when I can.



Thank you, all of you. Friends or foes. Buddies for life or mere acquaintences. I owe all of you."

"event","Okay, this is my end of the year entry (6 days early) I couldn't wait.
     This year has been great. The best I have had yet. So much has happened.

-James Anderson died in August, on the 8th. This was the saddest thing I think I have ever experienced. He and I weren't that close, but I think it was a lot about the fact that he was so young and it was so sudden. It scared me. It still does.
-I was on Color Guard. I met some of the best people in the world!
-I met Tim. This was great at first.
-I lost 3 of my friends, one of them was my best friend. This was for many reasons. Some had to do with my relationship with Tim. Some had to do with other things I'm not sure about myself.
-Leanne and I got REALLY close.
-Sam, Vickie, and Angela and I got really close. 
-I got my first kiss.
-I fell in love for the first time.
-Matt was diagnosed with Melanoma. This scared the crap out of me. My 'older brother' with cancer? I think that was one of the lowest points of the year.
-I learned what it was like to be loved by someone.
-Then I learned what it was like to be crushed by that same person that you gave your heart to.
-I was in my first show on the BHS auditorium stage
-When you cause harm to yourself, that hurts more than the reason you did it in the first place.
-I learned that sometimes second chances hurt you almost as much, if not more, than the first chance.
-Sometimes the one you love is the one who will disappoint you the most.
-Sometimes all it takes to believe you are pretty and worthwhile is to be told by someone who loves you and you know mean it.
-I learned who my true friends were, and I realised i was better off without the ones that werent.
-I got closer to my sister.
-The person that hurt me the most is the person that helped me the most. I learned from him that I was a good person, a person that deserved respect and happiness. A person that is attractive and worth a guys time. I also learned that I don't need a guy to tell me this. Because I don't have a guy whispering this in my ear right now, yet I still believe it :-).

I met some of the best people this year. And stopped talking to some of the worse. I came into my own. I learned that I am not a piece of shit to be walked on, but that I am a person worth someones love and worth someone caring about. I am proud of myself. I've grown up a LOT this year. And I think that overall, its a good thing. I used to be all depressed, but i realized that i'm a good person. I have a wonderful life ahead of me. I'm comfortable with how I look. I'm not ugly. And I'm a good person, which is more that a lot of people I know can say.

Let me know what you think."

"event","Hey,
Its been an alright week.
Except for Latin. Right now, I have failed a test and a quiz in a matter of a week and a half. both of which I've studied my ass off for. So I am quite upset about that. Now I have like a C for the term. And thats the class I have a final in. So I'm screwed!!
Things with the *someone* are moving along, slowly but pretty surely.
Ben's party was a BLAST. We played twister--i kicked ASS. I was literally unstoppable. I played at least 27 games, mostly it was just me and 1 other person. And I only lost 1, and that was because sandy got tired of me winning and 'tripped' over conrad lolz. But one of the games, with RJ, lasted like 40 min, so we called a truce--no one won. But I got myself into some REALLY compromising positions. It is safe to say that I am no longer a twister virgin. Although it could have been worse---someone suggested 'strip twister'.
The end was a lil iffy. Actually very iffy. But oh well.
I woke up today in PAIN!!! I cant walk. Too many twister games killed all my muscles (im not exacly light lolz)
Then leanne picked me up and we went to pauls party for a bit. had my fair amount of fun. and a YUMMY hot dog. lolz.

tomorrow im going to leannes at 3 with griff and sarah and wer hanging out till lyk 645, then wer going to see WICKED!!!! I'm so excited--i get to sit and watch all my friends for a change!

"event","Yes, yesterday was not fun. Found out some stuff I didn't want to hear.
I feel a bit betrayed because everyone around me knew about it and stuff but didnt tell me.
And its funny--im not sure why it upsets me so much. Sure, it was so close to after we broke up, but whatever. 
But right now i don't even know what i want. I don't know what I'm willing to give of myself anymore. Its like the saying goes hurt me once shame on you, hurt me twice shame on me. And i'm very shameful right now. And I feel like its my fault that i let it happen

dishonest--adj.--a lack of honesty
thank you dictionary.com


Color guard was yesterday. We have our new squad. And I get Leanne's flag next year!!! SO EXCITED!

Things are starting to work. 
I like *someone*. And I hope its mutual. *crosses fingers* because that peson is important to me.
And my grades are good. Except for Latin, I think I have a low, low, low B. But hopefully it stays there. Because I'm screwed if it doesn't.
My friends and I are getting along famously. I think I picked my friends very wisely. And its true what they say about friends being around longer than guys. I've also realised that NONE of my friends, with the small exception of one, have hurt me in the past few months. I have no reason not to trust most of my friends. and I have made some new ones (via greg) that seem trustworthy. So its all gravy.

right now I guess I'm feeling pretty shitty, but i see the light at the end of the tunnel. the sooner i figure out the one point of drama in my life, the better. I wish i was one of those people that could forgive and forget, but what happened a month and a half ago is still as prevalent to me as today. And thats life, i suppose.


this weekend=parties!/griffs actual b-day! So fun!! gotta figure out presents, though!!"

"event","Hey Guys!!

Its been a while since I updated.

Graduation was yesterday. I cried, a lot. Like a baby in fact. But I am so proud of all of my friends. I am also grateful. So much has happened this year that you were here for me for. I don't know what I would have done without you. Some of the seniors were my best friends, and the fact that they won't be there every morning when I get to school sucks ass. To be frank.

Samantha--Congratulations. I am really proud of you! And I'm glad that we are getting closer!

Other than that, I've been pretty busy. Hmm lets see. Last week, I forget which day, I went to her house and chilled with a bunch of people. Then Friday she picked me and Tim up from school, we drove around with Sandy, went to her house and watched a movie, picked up Ben, and then we went back to her house. Wow, that was an interesting night to say the least. Ben, you are a CRAZY cat!!! and completely INSANE! But amusing. Lolz. And a fun dancer!
Yesterday morning was SATs. Griff drove me, and on our way there we discovered that his mother wants him to take me to sr. prom lolz. We decided to be each other's reserve dates. Which should be cool! And the SATs were surprisingly easier than I though. It was very similar to MCAS, except the Reading part had vocab and sentence error stuff, but it was pretty easy. I think I did alright.
Tonight I'm off to Leannes house with all my pals to watch the Tonys! IM SO EXCITED! I love musicals, and this is the only award show that gives them the credit they deserve. Its definitely an Aimee show. But I can only stay until 10, cuz its a school night (frigin school...)

Then tomorrow is school, COLOR GUARD try outs (Its technically not a try out for me, but i hafta do the routine lolz) and CSPA. I think we are doing monologues :-/...

Tuesday is school then nothing.
Wed is the same.
Thurs is the same.

Then party time!! Friday is Ben's birthday/graduation party, Saturday is Pauls graduation party, Sunday is Griff's party and Wicked.
Then a school/Cspa week.
Then more partying. 
Saturday is Sam's grad party/sleepover in the tent.
Sunday is Leanne's graduation party.

and then its the last week of school.
OMG i really just realized that there are only 14 days left of school. That is so exciting. But nervewracking. I'm going to be an upperclassman. Next year I start the college searches, SAT prep classes, SATs that actually count, SAT2s (hardest things ever), find out about MCAS scores, have PROM (!!!!), vote in sr class officers, watch all of my 06 buddies leave and cry some more. I'm so nervous. This year has held some of the BEST memories I've ever had. This is my favorite year so far. A far cry from Jr. High. I have so many friends that I can just lean back on and trust them to catch me. I've majorly come out of my shell. I have crossed the line of 'never been kissed'. I have had so many good memories with so many people. Nothing,and no one, is holding me back anymore. I'm free to be who I want to be. I learned what it feels like to be the most loved person in someones life, I felt what it feels like to have your heart broken. I've learned so many lessons this year. I've learned that once I feel good about myself and how I'm living my life, I start to feel beautiful. And right now, I'm feeling pretty close. 
So many people have changed my life, and they don't even know it. I want to say thank you. Everyone whos ever talked to me has made me change. Some for the better, some for the worse. Even the one who broke my heart helped me feel better about myself, before and after. So everyone has an impact.
Thank you.

OK, now that that rant is over, leave me some lovely comments!!"

I went to Gregs house around 1, and we were sposed to go to the cape to see his cousin in guys and dolls, but the show got cancelled so we hung around his house with lauren and jess till like 10. Ate 2 packages of cookies between the 4 of us, each drank 3 cans of soda (1 sprite 2 orange) and watched part of Little Shop, part of Bring it On, and all of Saved! cuz it was a great movie. And lauren and jess each burnt me a cd, and i love them forever for it! We had tons of fun.
And jess and i discovered we have the same childhood. Both belonged to the JCC, both went (or in her case, goes to) spectrum for gymnastics and both went (and again, in her case goes to) temple israel. It was really weird, but cool at the same time.

Tonight I'm going to leannes house to have fun times. I don't know who else is going yet though.

I have a request. If anyone has a CD burner and can download music, could you make me CDs of any good broadway songs that you like, such as any good love songs or any good audition songs. I need some new music, but I'm tired of CDs that are all the same show. Its starting to get old. I will love you forever. And i need some new songs to choose from for my summer audition. I also need to get my mind off stuff and it seems like broadway music is the only thing that does that for me. Please and thank you, peas and corn, all that stuff. And if you are planning on it, please let me know. I don't care if its 2 songs or 20 songs, anything is better than nothing. Or if you have any good broadway CDs that you think I'd like, thatd be cool. I love you all!

Well MCAS was really easy, except for the stuff that didn't count. History and Chemistry were friggin the hardest thing EVER! I felt sooo stupid after i took them. I think I got maybe three right on the whole thing. Not as bad as *someone* who wrote different life stories for the 7 open responses. lolz. that made me laugh!
Umm my face is starting to get bigger. I have a minimal smile, my eye blinks (although it doesnt wink) and I will hopefully be able to wear the contacts by next week again. But according to the neurologist, I will probably have the symptoms for 4-6 weeks before it mostly goes away. But right now, I'm happy that I don't look COMPLETELY retarded.
The Straight Acting show went surprisingly okay. I felt bad for Maloney because half of her thing got skipped (I was pissed on her behalf), but I think I did alright. Yet again i listened to how wonderful everyone else did, but whatever. I really wanted feedback--what i did right and what i did wrong, what i could do to improve, that kind of stuff--but whatever! I'm really proud of Emily though--she did AWESOME!! i love my emeroy! But I'm hoping that by doing this show and doing my best that it was good enough to give me a little bit of edge for this summer's show. I want to really have a part that takes some character development. I want a part that I have to work to get into, like i had to work to get into my Eileen part. That would be awesome!

I was doing my makeup before the show the other day, and I randomly turned to Emily and said 'for the first time in more than a month, i actually feel pretty' i was so happy. And during the show, after my first scene, Emily's mom turned around to my mom and said 'Aimee is gorgeous' and during the whole show Ma was telling my mom how pretty I looked. That made me feel good. That's how I've wanted to feel. Now I know that I don't need guys to make me feel good. I am actually happy for myself.

No that the entry is over, you can just go right ahead and comment. no need to read the next thing. I only did it because i was IMMENSLEY bored. But please comment. I feel like I'm spilling my guts in this thing and no one reads it. At this point, just tell me that you read--you don't even have to comment on whats in here.

new news---
neurologist appointment later today. ehh...not looking forward to it

my face still isnt back...


last night i had quite the bout of saddness. we were watching phantom of the opera and i got this urge to just cry. about everything. about not feeling loved and wanted and me not having felt that way in more than a month (yes i know people are gonna say 'i love you' but i dont mean in that way). Its not that I was *him* back, but i want the way he used to make me feel back. that special feeling, like your on top of the world and nobody is better than you. the feeling that you mean the world to someone, and that they never will let go of you. i want to feel beautiful again. and i can't.
I tried on tons of clothes yesterday, and nothing looked good, with the exception of a couple shirts and skirts. just when i started to feel good about how i looked and where i was at body-shape wise, i hafta go shopping. on top of that, my face is all fucked up. and part of my confidence somehow came from my contacts, and i cant even have that, because my face is fucked up. and i dont know when it will come back.
and all my seniors are leaving.
so last night, i had an all out cry-a-thon. my first one in a month. I have been fine, but i just haven't felt like me in a couple days. I don't feel wanted, loved, missed, beautiful, wonderful, or on top of the world.
and i realized that, as much as i have a lot of people that care about me, they could all live without me. there are so many people that i could't live a day without, but none of them could probably say the same about me. I used to have that--the one person who depended on me as i much as i depended on them. but i don't anymore.
And i don't want this to sound like i want *him* back, because at this point, i don't. i don't think i have since it ended. And thats being completely honest. my trust is gone for that person. i want it to come back, but it takes some action for that. At this point, it would be nice to know i'm missed.
I just want that feeling that i had. I want to feel beautiful to someone again, i want to feel wanted by someone again. i want someone to look me in the eyes and say 'i love you' and actually mean it. how hard is that?



Sorry, this wasn't supposed to turn into this kind of entry. i was just supposed to put the first thing in.
Now i got myself crying.
Arghh....


If anyone read the whole thing, thank you.

And if you don't comment about the second part, at least do me the favor of commenting on the first. Ask me questions--itd be cool to know that someone WANTS to know something about me.

Love,
Aimee



...thats all i asked of you...."

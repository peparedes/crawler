so ive been thinking a lot of things over this past week or so, remembering good and bad times, stupid things ive said or done, broken hearts, whatever, and it came to me that i owe a lot of people apologies, whether or not they owe me one back.

if you want to go out for a talk then call me and we'll go get something to eat or just a plain and simple chat and ill get everything off of my chest that needs to be said so that you hear my side of our story and how i feel."

here's a few reasons why guys like girls... 
1. They will always smell good even if its just shampoo 
   2. The way their heads always find the right spot on your shoulder 
   3. How cute they look when they sleep 
   4. The ease in which they fit into our arms 
   5. The way they kiss you and all of a sudden everything is right in the world 
   6. How cute they are when they eat 
   7. The way they take hours to get dressed but in the end makes it all worth while 
   8. Because they are always warm even when its minus 30 out side 
   9. The way they look good no matter what they wear 
   10. The way they fish for compliments even though you both know that you think she's the most beautiful thing on this earth 
   11. How cute they are when they argue 
   12. The way her hand always finds yours 
   13. The way they smile 
   14. The way you feel when you see their name on the call ID after you just had a big fight 
   15. The way she says ""lets not fight anymore"" even though you know that an hour later you will be arguing about something 
   16. The way they kiss when you do something nice for them 
   17. The way they kiss you when you say ""I love you' 
      18. The way they fall into your arms when they cry 
   19. Then the way they apologize for crying over something that silly 
   20. The way they hit you and expect it to hurt 
   21. Then the way they apologize when it does hurt . (even though we don't admit it)! 
   22. The way they say ""I miss you"" 
   23. The way you miss them 
   24. The way their tears make you want to change the world so that it doesn't hurt her anymore"

alright so now you're thinking, yeah.. so and so is right, julia is a bitch. yes. i am.

anyways when i feel like it ill do pictures until then... 

my first day of skewl :) = pretty shitty. i have a feeling that im gonna hate this year more than i did last year. and i already have like 6 people monitoring my absences and tardies (if you knew me last semester ;)). okay so teacher breakdown:

spanish 3/hetu- i had her last semester and she hated me. 'nuf said.
honors world history/frye- absolute freak. i cant explain it, but let's just say that i was part scared, part laughing at him, part bored in his class. he's just a weirdass teacher and is always mean. :( gosh. 

geometry/robles- he's pretty cool but c'mon, it's geometry.


okay main reason i think this school year is going to suck big time- every single one of my teachers are enforcing the school rules x10. you know that shit that i pulled last year? its not gonna happen this year, unfortunately. :( they are FREAKING out about dress codes and cell phones and shit. apparently all the other schools have their dress code problems under control and we're the only ones slutting out big time.

alright so i looked like a slut today, i know :-/ 

awww it was so cute seeing all my freshman friends :) like mr. matthew felker.. awww he's a hawtie. 

let's seeeeeeeeee, me and justinian walked around lunch and let everyone know that we were infact, GBG girls. if you dont know what that is, dont ask, you're not cool enough to know ;)

and overall... iuno, the day just was pretty shitty to me. mebbe tomorrow will be better? gotsta go work on some presentations for history. sdjkfjsdrjfok."

YOU'RE OLD! you have nothing to look forward to in life cause when you retire all you do is sit around with your old husband in your old house filled with old memories that just depress you all the more. then when you go to the grocery store to pick up gas-x you see the younger, hotter, better women that you USED to be.

hmmm the next day we walked to Granada to see all the kiddies with no future (bah! just kidding), hung out around there, walked a shitload, saw some more people. next day i dont remember what we did but it involved walking. then the next day i ran down to country waffles for some french toast with my amigos. it was ridiculously expensive. i say we boycott that place. then we walked back to my house and i forgot what happened. a whole buncha shit basically since i was on my feet all friggin' day.

i have some pics that i'll post lateR.

so besides anna coming down ive been feeling like shit ALL week. first off, ive been sleeping shittily (yes, thats a word, bitches) for the past couple of weeks, then, i had dance conditioning on monday plus dance and i am sore like no other, horrible, horribly sore. plus all that walking. sheesh. my mom is really really sick, and whole bunch of other shit that im not at liberty to discuss, but some know.

just thinking about the past depresses me, but so does the future. i dont think ive ever been sure about anything in my life. and definately not this. cause i cant fit all these emotions into their places. so im stuck in confusion, guilt, anger, remorse, frustration, and sadness.

FISH! so i bought some fish! 2 lil fishes. the lady who was getting them out for me seemed so estatic about her job. she told me to never use tap water and i said ""oh, maybe thats why my other fish died."" but she didnt find it funny :( anyways, got my fishies and got a fish tank, some accessories, fish food, grabbed some slim fast cause that stuff is the shit. and left! then we went back to my house, set up the fishie tank, then played poker. but he had to leave after that. :( good times. :D

then summer school tomorrow. bah. someone call me if you wanna do something."

"event","i dont remember what ive been doing for the past week. :-/

saturday i had a dance recital and lets just say it didnt go as well as planned 'cause a certain someone couldnt remember any of a certain dance and a certain other person (okay it was me) was most certainly pissed.

sunday i did nothing. 

today i had summer school. yup, i have algebra 1A and 1B. but the good thing is i finished 1A in about a week. hell yes! im about to finish the whole semester in 2 weeks! see children, julia really is intelligent. just doesnt feel the need to wake up at 7 in the morning, get ready, and go to class everyday and sit through 3 one and half hour classes a day. julia feels it to be much more appropriate to wake up at 12, then go to lunch and PE. or sometimes not even go at all.

but yeah, i gotta say, summer school wasnt nearly as bad as i thought. i get to spend it with the love of my life, miss alex quesada ;) , some freakish goth kids in trenchcoats, wiggers, and skanks.

not sure my plans for the rest of the summer but eh, something will happen."

"event","summary of the last couple of days:


andrew and conrad came over and gave me chicken noodle soup. :) they are awesome.

watched 50 first dates with erin, jen, and jamie. did anyone else think that that movie was sad? how could they end it like that? SHE NEVER GETS BETTER!

layed around because i have no energy 'cause im sick. no fun.

played capture the flag with like 8 guys and kimmie. kimmie was on the other team :( i dove into a bush trying to catch kyle. i dont like that game anymore.

while walking home from playing capture the flag (circa 12:30pm) i saw like 10 college kids duct taping. i knew them too. theyre strange kids.

and now i think im gonna go to the regal and watch dodgeball. fo sho ;)



ooh yeah, and me and beef are both very sick kiddies. we're starting a fund to raise money for the research of the unidentified disease that we have that could be fatal. donate or else we're gonna die."

"event","so basically.. (do i sound like andrew or what?) im waiting for my report card and am praying to GOD that i dont have to go to summer school, that would just suck big time. i shouldnt have ditched so much :-/ dayuuum.

oh and another thing, im starting to listen to country, AHHHHHH! i used to be the most anti-country person ever. i hate everyone who made me listen to it.

let's seeeee... today i woke up a las cuatro... CUATRO! what the hell? my sleeping pattern is so jacked up. then i sat around and ate muddy buddies. then me and james walked to albertsons and i convinced him to walk with me to get my nails done if i bought him baskin robbins but once we got there the nail place was closed. and i had to buy james baskin robbins anyways :-/ what a cheap butthead. so then we went back to james with a buncha people and all i remember is bryan picking me up and sticking me in the sprinklers, what an ASS. yup yup. then me and bryan walked around l-town and talked. then as i was walking home this creep in a ghetto green car kept driving by reallllll slow about 6 times. AND NO ONE WOULD COME PICK ME UP! do you realize that i could have died?!?! i prayed all the way home. sheesh. 

soooo i came home and got in another fight with my parents. yup, just lovely. i cannot wait till im 18. approximately 3 years 2 months 8 days 21 hours 41 minutes till my 18th birthday.

now im sittin here talking to a certain someone and chillin' in my underwear. im such a bAller."

"event","wow, the school year is almost over. and let me just say that it SUCKED. big time. next year had better be better. anyways, who's throwing a party?

anyways, i didnt do much today seeing as i didnt go to school. im sick, i think i have the flu and it's frickin' JUNE! what is up with that? not cool. i tried going on a diet and exercising but that didnt work out seeing as i eat like a cow. temptation, blah. 

i think that everyone should read andrew slavec's livejournal. he has some interesting entries. a few sound like he was high while writing it but good nonetheless.






i still miss you."

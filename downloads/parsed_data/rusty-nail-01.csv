It was a hoot. Then I got home and stayed up for a while longer before going to bed. The next morning I woke up and I went to my brothers and his girlfriends baby shower. I had fun there. It took them an hour and a half to open their presants. I think I was the only one who enjoyed it. lol. Yea, i'm a loser baby, why dont you kill me..*breaks out in song* I cant even remember the rest of the week. I'm just so happy that the school year is almost over and i'm just so pumped! Today I was showing my moms friend, Jill, some of my prom pics and I came running down the stairs..and the corner of the frame hit the side of the stairs and I scraped it along my side and i've been bleeding.

"event","if you read below...*from long time ago until most reason like a non-alien would do* then you would know that i have a best friend..you would also know that her name is christa marie bettis. and youll know shes my best friend ;) but i just thought i'd make this segment about her..and our friendship..and the things we do. so if you know me and christa then you know that we are exactly alike and we were switched at birth and we're twins..we're only three hundred and sixty one days apart :D so yea..we are both cancer...and if you know your horoscopes then you know cancers get along best with other cancers. so anyways..we met back in the ol' seventh grade but it wasnt until the 8th grade that we became *best* friends. so instantly we connected and since then we have just been the best of best friends. i cant remember all the stories, unfortunatly. so anyways..i do have a lot of great ones..you might not think they're funny..but we sure do! so one is we were going up north and she pulled out a little  hair out of her head and i was like..'oh hey, watch this' and i pulled out this big chunk of hair and both our eyes got big and we just stared at us because neither of us expected that much to come out. but you have to understand..it was like *a lot* of hair..so then we were in the car and my mom was getting gas..so i rolled down my window a little bit with the curiosity of wut it'd feel like to get my finger caught in the window..so i rolled the window up on my finger and it was right where my finger bends by the nail. well alls you hear is this HUGE crack..because the music was kinda loud and christa was in the back, and she still heard it. so she asks me wut i do and i tell her. so then she decides she wants to try. so she rolls her window down you hear it go up then stop then christa scream and start laughing. i asked her wut happened and she says 'i rolled up the window and i got scared so i paniced and hit the up botton and my fingers got stuck in the window' and she showed me her fingers and you can still see the line from the window. so last summer..we were up north when we decided to go out for a late night swim. well we did and that made us want to skinny dip..so we did. well we were all naked and stuff..this boat of old people go by..and my top is tangled..but christa got into hers alright..well..mines all tangled and i cant get it on..so we both run out of this lake and i'm just sitting there half naked with a bunch of old people looking at me. grand i say. soooo we usually just do stupid stuff like that..like for example..on monday christa came over. well.. i was on my period and all..and i had to change my tampon. and wut you have to understand about this story is that my toilet is being fixed..and for about a week it was off the wall..and on monday it was put back, well there was a 'do not use' sign that was supposed to be on there, but wasnt..so i didnt see it, but christa did and decided not to tell me. so i change my tampon and use all this toilet paper and right before i walked out of the bathroom christa says 'wait..let me go pee before we leave' so she does and well..we go downstairs and my mom comes upstairs to find the toilet like this. so she yells for me 'KATARYNA GENEVIEVE' *thats my -uh oh i'm in trouble- name* you'd just have to hear it i guess. and i got the mom voice..and my mom she was MAD beyond MAD. well, she gives me a plastic bag and tells me to get the paper towel roll and we had to clean the toilet out..and we werent allowed to use tongs or anything. so we got the honors of doing that. oh yea, and one time we took a bath together in her new house and i was on my period and she was about to start hers, so we take a bath for the first time in that bath..and i get out and she gets in..well we drain the water a nd this huge trial of blood was draining with it..and we both pointed the finger at eachother. lol it was great. but she checked so she just started her period. so we will never know who did it. so one time i stayed at her house and we decided to sneak out. well we wanted something cool to do so we put a whole bunch of food together and mix it and then we get ketchup mustard toilet paper and tampons .. youknow..the works..well christa also shits in a bag..lmao. so we snuck out and we decided to put it on a friends drive way that we really dindt like and then light it on fire. well then we go to our teachers house..did you know that when ketchup and mustard mixes..that it causes a chemical reaction causing the paint on someones house to peel off and/or stain the house..well...we didnt. so we got in trouble for ""vandilism"" lol. i duno..she's my best friend..and i love her..and no matter wut..whenever we get introuble or we get hurt..you know we're together. so yea i'm gonna end this because i'm REALLY tired. lol. so i love her and thanks for actually reading this if you did. bla"

"event","Lots of you may think you have no life. I, myself, never have anything to do. So I usually try to find things to do. Well this weekend I didnt need to find anything to do for it found me. ""What did you do this weekend?"" some of you might ask. Well for those of you out there who asked that question will get this response:
 This weekend I went over to my *BEST* friends house. Her name is Christa Marie Bettis...and let me tell you something. When me and her get together for a weekend-there is *always* something to do...so i went over to her house on friday night which also happened to be the night of a formal dance which the hicks around there call the Snow Ball Dance, and we happened to be going. Well the dance was rather exciting because I got to catch up with lots of friends I havn't seen in a while and my most best of friends *including christa* were the lucky ones that got to hang out with me. haha. 
  So that event was fun, but unfortunatly it went by rather fast and ended rather early. We arrived at christa's house around midnight-ish only to go up to her room, change, and come downstairs to start watching cartoons with her 13 year old brother. His name is Danny. Christa fell asleep while me and Danny staid up until 1 or 1:30 just watching cartoon network. Afterwards we decided to head on up the stairs into his room so we could play his really cool game station with about 6 different games on it. Well we played that for a good half hour then i got curious on why his room was still decorated with christmas decorations. So I took all of his decorations down off of his dressers and things and I replaced them with his G.I. Joe toys and accessories. Thats when we decided to PLAY with the G.I.Joes. Exciting, huh? Well both of our guys were indistructable so I bet you can most definitly guess what kind of game that ended up to be. Well it actually started off as all the G.I. Joes being gay...then they all died. Only Dannys guy *the mad man* and my guy *the one with the very bad rip off version of a girly arnold swartzineger voice* started fighing. So he was just a mad man and i was all of that *that i just wrote* and the guy was gay...he wore a satellite on his head for a hat so he could have good reception everywhere he went, and he lived under a candle holder. So he lived an exciting life. Well we staid up until 3:00 or so just playing that game. Then it started to get boring and I went to bed. 
  Well its saturday now. haha. We did a lot of nothing. Me and christa saw Along Came Polly...which I already saw before. But there is no harm in seeing a movie w/ your best friend right? Well she took a balloon full of sand w/ us and i hadn't known that...she was biting on it and it broke open into her mouth...so she spit it and there was a puddle of spit by her feet. then she dumped the sand all over me so i took the sand off of me and put it in her hair then we threw the bag at some chick. then we rode around in the elevator...then went to gfs and lastly went home and did nothing for the rest of the day. So we went to bed early because we were both tired. 
  This morning we got up and went to my church and hung out w/ Manny because he's a cool cat...and we hung out with amanda, his sister...and we sat in the balcony and just talked the whole time....then we came to my dads house...did a bunch of nothing...which leads me up to right now...So I hope you enjoyed my weekend as much as i did..."

so then we headed over to coney island and i was getting my food everywhere...and i had this creamer and i was like 'do you know what milk does when it goes in sierra mist or sprite?"" and she's like GET THAT AWAY FROM MY DRINK! and i was like ""damnit, how did you know what i was going to do?"" she's like ""i know yoU"" and i just kept doing stuff like that...then i put it in my water and started drinking it and she got all grossed out...which by the way- it doesn't taste that bad. so anyways, she was grossed out and i told her i'd pay her if she would drink it..but she didnt. what a gimp.

(for this next part you have to understand this: Mel=moms evil boyfriend plotting to kill us all
   Me=i hate him)

afterwards i was talking to her about mel and she was telling me about all these guys that want to *date* her and i said something about mel like ""well is his experiance over with"" or something like that and she was like ""i'm not gonna break up w/ mel for a long time"" and i was like ""wuts a long time for you?"" 

SOOOO that was my lovely day so far...and its only 1 PM now...so i still have more comming...but i more than likely wont put it on here because i'm a lazy son of a bitch."

"event","Poem:
""Hungry""
I get hungry for knowlege, but i have to learn to know. I get hungry for love, but first i must learn to grow. When I get hungry, I go and I search for what i am looking for. By Time I find it, there is no more. I get hungry for friends, but I must learn to love. I get hungry for God, but i must first look above.

Song:
""When It's cold outside""
Its cold outside
and everyone around you isn't going to be your friend
When its cold outside
Nobody will love you but everybody wants to be your friend
Its cold outside
when Its cold outside

You're two days late
and everything is gone
when you thought everything was going right
it got wrong
you gathered up all your anger just to write this song
but it took you to get here much too long

you used to sit by the fire writing a difficult love poem
and letting your mind roam
its just so hard because...

Its cold outside
and everyone around you isn't going to be your friend
when its cold outside
nobody will love you but everyone wants to be your friend
its cold outside...
when its cold outside..

everyone is begining to piss you off
but you dont care because...
its cold outside"

"event","Ahoy thar maightys...jump on the boat of nothingness. Here I am, Thee K-daddy. Ok-youre right, i'm a girl. but whatever, dude. Today I am going to talk about people. ""why?"" you ask. I'll tell you why. Its because there are good people and bad people in this world. Its amazing how different people can be. I love it! But I dont love all people...crazy shit-eh? so anyways. People. There is too much to say if you even care. There are a lot of great people out there. I love it when someone is kind to like...EVERYONE. even when they dont want to be. they're just full of sooo much love! there are very few people like that in this crazy place we call earth. Then there are those people who are always bitching about something...dont you hate that? i know i do. If there isn't something wrong with their day, then they'll make something wrong. it is f'ed up mf'er. so along with bitchy there follow the people who love to compete ALL the time... yea-sure its fun to have competition...like in sports and things...but there is a time where you can do other things than compete! For example...there is this guy i know...he's cool, but he always brags about how he works out. Then he turns around and brags about how he always gets beat up by 14 year old girls who are scrawnier than him. WHY WOULD YOU BRAG ABOUT THAT?! if i ever heard anyone brag about that in person...i'd probably beat them up...maybe. I fall into this next catagory though- lazy. There are too many people in the world who are obease *well, i'm not* but did you know that over 60% of the American population is obese? Its crazy! we need to get out there and exercise! yea, sure its cool to have taco bell about 4 days a week (just kidding, maybe once in a while its ok) but you shouldn't have to eat it every day. its this technology that makes us lazy, i swear. We rely on our computers, and our cars to do all the work for us. We need to learn how to think for ourselves, and to get out there and get active! This next group of people are what get me going *next to the bitchy ones* they are people who are ALWAYS depressed! i dont understand how everyone can be depressed ALL  the time. Yea sure, we sometimes get depressed because something bad happens in our life, but we dont need to revolve the next 10 years over it. If you had a bad childhood i say ""get over it, and live life now..live life like you should"" my most favorite quote would go perfect w/ this....""Dream as if you will live forever and live as if you will die tomorrow"" which ties in with my most favorite kinds of people- the people who seek adventure *i'd fall under this catagory too* the people who look for danger, the people who live life on the edge...THATS HOW TO LIVE IT UP, BABY! i dont know how much i try to stress this to people. I swear...Its...crazy. i dont understand those people who take all percautions, who are always so perfect, they seem like they got a stick up their assholes...i just dont know... so those are my thoughts...sorry if i just totally wasted your time on this...hope you enjoyed! -kat"

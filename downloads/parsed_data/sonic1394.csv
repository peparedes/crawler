<br />Hi I&#39;m a CAMS student who began his live journal on may 11, 2002 at 5:44 pm<br />......<br />
<br />***********************<br />
<br />MUAhahaha Hi all, I&#39;m this mofo who is 26 yrs old, recently rediscovered livejournal because I have this brilliant idea. Actually i have many. After so many yrs of college, things like this tend to happen. I have finders that cannot control the keyboard. this shit is literally being ripped from the neurons wrapping on the outer surface of my white matter within my skull.<br />
<br />Basically i think Ferris Beullers day off is over. This motherfucker who is an 80s icon must return. When this guy made this movie, he was 24 yrs old. ONLY 2 yrs younger than me and he is memorable for his babyface character as IMDB recalls. I just saw the fucken clips and I see how this fatass has let go. He can totally redo his persona. He did inspector gadget. We should all write to him and the studios, because I have the script in possession. I have what will redo this 80s phenommenon. And we shall call it Ferris Beuler&#39;s Day of Reality.........<br />
<br />
<br />Everyone loved this film because this guy never got caught. Well now that life sucks, this economy is in shit and he is wayyy older. The guy is a family man. He is literally, the family guy. Mixing persona&#39;s and what this guy is known for. The comedy will be there however we will require less dramatic shit, adding reality to the mix. If anyone recently saw the changeup, I&#39;m sure you get my drift. Family requires tons of energy and tolerance. It&#39;s fucken reality. We need to bring the 80s back, because this icon merits a circle of life sequel.<br />

to start off it is now august... WHOA wat a jump from my last entry huh... ya thts cuz my life is too boring and I didn't want to put you to sleep... anyway... after lunch I rushed my way to geology.... and mann that class must have had 100 students in there.... well anyway I brought a desk from the next room and this hot hispanic chick tapping my desk throught the period... I kind of got annoyed and wanted to scare her off by talking to her... so that she could stop bumping my desk... Ya I talked to her, No she didn't get scared... I guess thats cuz I didn't hit on her... WELL I'll be sure to do that next time... HMM>>. after GEO, I went to the student store where I went shopping for some books... YES SHOPPING.... thhis is where all myh mula goes... into frkn books...   anyway .... I spent so much time in there and I got really late to my next class.. ... ACA DECA... yes Decathelon... I dunno why I'm in tht shit... I've lost hope... I guess I jst want the 5 high skool credits tht it gives...  Well, after tht crap, I went to the office, picked up the everyday bulletin and went off to my business....
On my way out.. I saw a foxy lady.... ya FOXY.... well the only hint I'll give is that she's in cross country and she's short in comparisson to me.... I don;t kno if thats good or bad...  It jst sux how I've made my life so complicated........but what I do kno is that I need more friends because I'm a loner mann.... I guess its my own strength yet my own weakness...
by the way I have maruna tomorrow so meg your pardon, I must depart... ADeiu"

"event","well today was a  long day and im pretty tired even though I took a 4.5 hr nap. I aven't updated this journal in a while.A lot has happened since my last entry. I've become really good friends with people. But lately one of those persons has been having attitude problems. Even though she doesn't say what her problem is, I know its there. Maybe she just doesn't care about me, because she seems to act normal around other people. Well AMP is soon going to end, the day before yesterday I thought that these were the best days of my life, that day was the day that i went to the beach with some friends. The best part was the rollercoaster..... I shoulda thrown up on the person sitting next to me jk.... no actually, that ride was the highlight of my day...  well anyway little things like that wouldn't matter to the best friend i have who' having these moods swings. I hope she gets over it because it hasn't been the same without her normal self.. But who knows maybe our tight friendship ended when she had this change of attitude. .... well
Good day... I'm off to eat.. n by the way I don't ignore my friends simply because I'm updating my live journal.....so ttyl"

I haven't had a life for a long time now..... but as I've said before, this summer will kick ass....

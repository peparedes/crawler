"event","i need to talk... to anyone who will listen... i don't even care who you are... i need to be heard and understood... 

i fucking hate life at this point... it feels like nothing i do is right or good enough for anyone... i can't please anyone or myself here as of late.

my parents fucking suck... they bitch at me constantly and i don't even know why... it's enough to drive you crazy

my love life is for the goddamn birds... i hate myself and everyone around me anymore... 

i can't do this much longer... i'm gonna explode... i cry all the time... tears just start pouring down my face... 

i have one friend... who is absolutely amazing and i don't know what in the world i would do without her... 

but someimes that one person, can't fix your life and everything that's so fucked up in it... 

rylee is my heart and soul but someimes i feel like she'd be better off if i wasn't here... she sees me cry and it makes her cry... i feel like i just upset her and she hasn't done anything... but she appologizes for me crying... when it's not her fault... makes me feel like shit... 

i wish i just felt good for one day... but i can't really talk to anyone... i mean, like in depth... i used to be able to... now it's just misunderstood... and then i get to feel like it's all my fault again... 

i've never felt like this in my life... and i wish i knew how to make it go away...."

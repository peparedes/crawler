"event","Has is almost been two years or more since I've visited this place? I can't believe I've been gone so long. As bitter as my last entries were, at least they were the truth. I was the bitter girl who wrote those angry posts. And I suppose I still stand by them today.

I will never hold beauty again, my voice will never soar, my heart will never beat in time and I will never dance. I'm giving up my childhood and growing up right now. No more laughter, or day dreams or fantasies to help me through the bad days. I'm cutting off my wings and forgetting how to fly. 

I'll wipe the gaudy stage makeup off and put away the costumes. I'll embrace grey and black and brown and forget rainbows and prisms. The heart that beat beneath my breast will wither up and die. I'm refusing myself, and killing myself to fit in here right now. 


I can't believe I forgot this... it seemed so full of me, all other journals seemed so full of lies and I finally let myself breathe here, live here, and now after so long, I'm destroying whatever the hell made me, me."

Fuck that. I've worked so hard at making you happy, and then, when I finally crack, and tell you that you've become someone to whom I can't relate, you become distraught, and stupid. I HATE YOU! With all my core being. I hate you with nothing short of passion. I loathe the way you act weak, and single minded, no one cares if you are smart! I dislike your one track mind... well four tracked mind, but still compared to the millions you could have, it isn't much. I dislike you inability to learn from experiances, so you must read fiction! to find out where you went wrong, fiction that doesn't relate to you. I'm wasting this entry, because in the end, none of this is true hate, its just dislike for the face you show me."

"event","I think that so many people are holding this election to be very important, however how many people are voting? Not many in my generation. I wish I could vote this year, I think that I could help so much more than just volunteering. Oh well. At least I'm doing that. 

So many people are pissing me off. I was talking to a friend all day long about various subjects, mostly about politics however. And I realized how damn apathetic my friends are, even though I do not believe my generation is. It is just that so many people believe since they cannot vote, there is no need for them to be interested. I strongly disagree. Even if you cannot vote it doesn't matter, you can still get involved.

Now that is something to celebrate, yes that is right, lets howl at the moon, beat our chests, thank all the millions of gods that have ever been thought up, thank you for killing me. 

I'm so fed up with high school. How can one place hold so much moronic pieces of shit that waste air and use too much hair product, without imploding? Seriously, that would be a cause I could die for, blow up all the highschools after saving the smart people.

"event","I used to think I knew so much, I could tell you little pieces of information that you would laugh about and wonder how I knew that. Now I think because of that I've given up on learning. I often wonder what happened to promises that I've made to myself, ones that were all about becoming a better person, and learning how to do so much. Well now I don't think I could be a better person with out locking myself up, and eating the key. Oh well, I suppose I must sow what I've reaped, even if I can't remember exactly what I've done to deserve this. 

Depression isn't funny, it isn't something to be laughed at, or wondered why someone has it. There isn't a reason that you need, to languish in the fact that your paranoia is creeping up on you to give you tears. I'm guilty, I often wonder why people don't listen to the dramatic, but in hindsight, I don't either, I don't care about why they cry, or if they do. I often stare and wonder how someone could be so weak, to cry in someone else's arms. To show that side of yourself would be so degrading, to me. Thats why I'm stoic and silent when I want to cry, bottleing this all up inside myself has never hurt me, and I've certainly never felt the need to cry in someone else's arms. 

I've got way too many thoughts running amuck in my mind right now, and I almost wish I could take over the world and just sit there with a giganitc megaphone and tell everyone how I feel. But thats admitting defeat, to realize you cannot take care of yourself and emotions. I'm not defeated yet."

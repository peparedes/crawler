<b>Saturday 08 October</b>
Matt Snyder's Dust Devils, run by Neil Smith. Didn't quite ""bite"" for me. We had a bloody rampage but I would have liked to have seen some more ""human"" and nuanced interactions. Still, I like Dust Devils a lot, and it was enjoyable.

D. Vincent Baker's Murderous Ghosts (playtest) with Scott Dorward. Scott GMd and I played. I survived the murderous ghosts, just.

I had hoped to play a game of Matt Machell's The Agency in the afternoon, but some of the other people at the con were looking for someone else to run a game. So I said I would do something to make a game happen. They wanted Dungeon World, and it turned out that two of the people calling for DW liked it far less than the other two players and me. Huh, who knew? The dice rolling was truly disastrous, though, mostly misses! This was a particular problem for two of the players who felt they had no traction without successes.

I also felt the party's general plan of action, actual moves and their defiance in the face of a bad (and worsening) situation really didn't help. So, the wizard was cleaved dead with a sword swipe from a Goblin champion (despite being Blessed by the Cleric too), and the player of the evil thief really wasn't enjoying his choice of evil thief. So we called it off.

What would I have done differently? I don't know. It seems to me that the two players it didn't work for can't have it patched for them. In their shoes I would have been rolling on my highlighted stats to get XP (something the Thief player just wasn't going to do) and level up regardless. I'd not have split the party. Or when it did split, I wouldn't have split it again. I'd not have persisted in the fight with the goblins when the backstabbing ambush failed. And faced with some hard choices I would have let the Cleric defy danger rather than the Wizard. Maybe the book needs some basic dungeoneering/tactical advice? I don't know. These aren't stupid players, though. So I think there was a mis-matched expectation too.

From a GM point of view, I would have liked to know what sort of damage I could hand out on a miss. At low level the difference between 3 and 5 damage can be huge (5 was enough to kill the Wizard, 3 caused just 1 HP damage to the well-armoured Thief). Keeping some of my moves unsaid left the feeling that nothing was happening on a miss (well, apart from fictional stuff). I was doing things though. Giving hard choices, putting in a spot, separating one from a weapon, depleting their resources, etc. As it turned out the Goblins were open to negotiation, but the PCs hadn't considered that. Well, the fighter did, after he Spouted Lore about a goblin guide he had met on his travels many years ago. In the end I sensed that the Wizard and Thief had bailed on the game, and it was getting implausible to me that the Goblins wouldn't cause harm if the failing fighting continued. So, chop.

To end the day I played the Cambria board game with 3. Again fun! I really like this and it is quick! (Unlike the never-endng game of Bang! that I wisely chose not to play, as it turns out!) Oh, I happened to win this one (prior experience giving me the edge rather than any great ability!). But the scores were all around the low to mid-20s.

<b>Sunday 09 October</b>

Murderous Ghosts with Scott again. Me MCing and Scott playing, using the latest playtest rules. Scott's character died. Fun! Creepy concrete dust fun.

Then Ron Edwards' S/Lay w/Me with Scott. Raw, visceral pulp fantasy with Scott playing Kal the demon born and I was GMing as his Father/Mother demon. Kal lost the Match, got his Goal and was subsumed into his parent. Icky and glorious.

Later on it was Jason Morningstar's Fiasco, as High School Kids (from the Companion). Really great story came out of this. The tone of our game perhaps jarred a little with the mandated outcomes of the roll at the end. Arguably. But it was really enjoyable nevertheless.

To end the con we did  a couple of hours of Remember Tomorrow. No one got out of the Episode. The Metropolitan Police got very Influential as a Faction and perhaps were closest. Some stories were mixing very well. The time line was also jumbled in a pleasant way. With further play I wanted to see what the Scavenger story was about, but we didn't have time. The levers and switches in the game worked pretty well for the players around the table. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but for the crowd playing I think it hits a lot of buttons."

"event","This week there are two very worthy charity drives going on, that I'm more than happy to be involved with.

The Christchurch Earthquake has devastated the city. Money is being raised for New Zealand Red Cross by the creation of a bundle of games at OneBookShelf. Matt McElroy has been fantastic in getting a great range of products together from a variety of publishers.

You can pick up my <b>Remember Tomorrow</b>, Neil Gow's <b>Beat to Quarters</b>, Malcolm Craig's <b>Cold City</b> and Nathan Paoletta's <b>Annalise</b>, along with mainstream RPG stuff like <b>CthulhuTech</b>, <b>Scion:Hero</b>, <b>Supernatural Roleplaying Game</b> and <b>Tales from the Floating Vagabond</b>.

<a href=""http://tiny.cc/sRYOP""><img src=""http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/threesixteen/art/316img400.jpg""></a>

3:16 is up for <a href=""http://www.ennie-awards.com/nominations/09coverart.asp"">Best Cover in the ENnies</a>.

I'm thrilled about that and you all should <strong>vote for it!</strong>

I like the whole (front/spine/back) cover design actually, and I think it's pretty tight (though I do find it ironic to be up for the Best Cover when I think the strongest thing about the game is the way it plays). Anyway, I was talking with the artist Paul Bourne about how he made the cover and he came up with this:

<blockquote>The image for the cover of 3:16 was made in 3 separate stages, each stage being created on its own and brought together to create the final image. Firstly, I modelled a 3D mesh missile in 3DS. I tried to keep the missile as detailed as possible as, at this point, I was unsure how big the missiles would be in the final image.
 
The missile was then taken into Bryce 6.1 where it was textured and shaded. The missile was then lit from above with a white spotlight to simulate sunlight, as well as a blue area light underneath to simulate ambient light reflecting from the planet. I then glue the missile and lights together so that they could be copied and arranged into a basic composition. 
 
The planet was created using 2 mesh spheres: 1 slightly smaller sphere inside the other. The outer sphere was textured with a semi-transparent cloud texture and a 'fuzzy' filter to represent a basic atmosphere, the inner with the blue planet texture. The finished planet model was then brought together with the missile compostion and rendered against a plain black background.
 
The render was then taken into Photoshop were the green gas clouds and stars were added. To complete the image I added the city lights and a bit more atmosphere to the planet.

Finally, the lense blooms were added to the missile engines and the explosion effect overlayed on to the planet.</blockquote>

I think that's pretty insane and a cool thing. Between the initial cover image and the final one Paul moved some of the drop ships (since they're suspended in space as a 3-d model) -- and I have an image of a drop ship on its own somewhere too. I should put the word around about this.

And vote for the other products you like too."

I will gladly take a nom via Paul's artistic work! Though, I like to think my cover design works hand in hand with his image and doesn't screw up his great image, y'know.

Oh, you do know that Paul's image is actually a 3-D computer model that he makes, skins, renders, lights and then captures. Wow."

The smacking of head upon head, the shrill screeching of a drunk and rowdy woman first trying to stop a fight then egging one on bringing it back to the boil. Even though the belligerent so-called hard man who started all the trouble has been belted over a car bonnet, had his arm dislocated and his head punched repeatedly into the street. Even he has had enough, doll, so stop punching the man in the White shirt he doesn't want to hit you back but he might just.

"event","Prompted by a comment in a thread on <a href=""http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=10030418&postcount=86"" target=""_blank"">RPGnet</a> I contemplated the much maligned nature of <a href=""http://www.linotype.com/1540/timesnewroman-family.html"" target=""_blank"">Times New Roman</a> and <a href=""http://www.linotype.com/1537/times-family.html"" target=""_blank"">Times</a>.

I think it's a rather classic and clear font.

Personally, for a long time I have avoided using it, just because it seems to be everywhere and it's ""not cool"". However, let's look at it again. It's a very readable font, and is utterly functional.

Times (no pun intended), too, are changing. These days Word doesn't deault to Times New Roman any more, as I'm sure <a href=""http://www.thomasphinney.com/2009/02/bob-hayes-nfl-forgery/"" target=""_blank"">the supposed half-sister of Bullet Bob Hayes wishes it still did</a>. It now uses Calibri, a modern ""humanist"" sans-serif font.

I remember working on <a href=""http://gregorhutton.com/incarnate/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Incarnate</a> in 2002 and I was taken with the title font. Can you guess what the font in <a href=""http://gregorhutton.com/incarnate/Incarnate2.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the PDF</a> is? Give yourself a point if you guessed Times.

And <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2008/11/obama-teams-sur.html"" target=""_blank"">Barack Obama switched to it too</a>.

Perhaps the problem with Times and its use is simply bad design by people who don't know what they're doing. Certainly I can imagine that a <a href=""http://www.linotype.com/1321/papyrus-family.html"" target=""_blank"">Papyrus</a> header (now, <i>that</i> does seem to be everywhere in fantasy RPG books) and then a wall of Times text would be like a bat to the head, page after page. Let's not blame that on the font.

For the record, I'm using a lot of <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1706"" target=""_blank"">Myriad</a> and <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1719"" target=""_blank"">Minion</a> at the moment, and periodically make use of <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1709"" target=""_blank"">Warnock</a> (which has the most delightful x character in italic). I do still have a soft spot for <a href=""http://www.linotype.com/469/frutiger-family.html"" target=""_blank"">Frutiger</a> too."

"event","So, I'm back from New Zealand where I had a great time at Morgue and Cal's wedding in Wellington on the North Island. They were both such kind and attentive hosts, and are a great fit for each other.

Cal has also given me the taste for L&P and Bourbon.

While in South Island, though, I did have a bit of a mishap on our last day there. I was doing just a couple of hours of early morning walking in the Abel Tasman National Park when I slipped off a path and fell into a steep and rocky river creek. It was about 7:15 am, at the limit of when we had to turn back too.

<lj user=""lostperdita""> stepped with her left foot and avoided the really slick bit of mud disguised as good ground. I stepped with my right foot onto it and slipped a couple of feet off the edge of the track. At first I thought I was just going to get muddy but I then went backwards over the edge, which as you can guess wasn't too cool.

I grabbed a couple of trees on the way down and while each one broke under my weight, they also broke my fall a bit. Anyway, I hit pretty hard on a rock, or a tree, with my lower back while my shoulders planted square on a muddy bank or clear ground (thankfully). It was about 6-7 feet down, upside down. I'm told I looked like I had been folded in half and jammed into the creek. My head, while tucked into my chest to keep my hat on, banged a log as my right forearm cushioned my fall into the shallow water of the stream.

When I stopped falling I had this bizarro, close-up, view of a log with the world upside down. I was pretty sure I had broken something, but didn't feel anything obviously hurt, except my pride. On getting up I found my back sore but my hips were good.

I managed to get up and out of the creek with some help from <lj user=""lostperdita""> and a couple of attempts to climb a tree out of there. We made good back to the main path, <lj user=""lostperdita""> slipped a little on the path back up too, but I managed to hobble safely up with her.

It seems kinda dumb describing it as ""I fell in a creek"", which seemed comical to those I told. Anyway, while we can laugh about it, it was a bit more edgy than that and I'm pretty amazed in a good way that I didn't come off much worse. I guess I am pretty lucky (I hope) and that it's just a really bad bruise and I've not done anything too bad.

Anyway, initially I had a small mark on my back, but the whole area that was tender around it is now badly bruised. You can see after the cut. I think it's pretty grim, and the photo doesn't do it justice.

<lj-cut text=""Click for pic of my Eye of Sauron natural tattoo... NSFWusses"">

It kinda looks like an Eye of Sauron tatoo, to be honest...

Life has been overbusy recently, at times very stressful and most other times fun.

I've also written a piece for FlamesRising.com's Halloween-themed October special. They'll be putting up a monster a day in October.

Mine was inspired by Ron Roberts' character name for a Nocturnals game that never got off the ground: so The HaemoGoblin will be appearing online at some point in Oct.

Oh, and I stepped on a little bit of broken glass in my kitchen. Is there a HaemoGoblin nearby? We'll need to read FlamesRising.com to find out how to deal with the little blighter!"

A couple of tracks I liked less but a few I liked quite a bit. Unforgiven III seems to meet a rolling of the eyes when you look at it on the album sleeve, but it's not bad.

Oh, I got the CD, obv., but the case and booklet will forever be ""album"" and ""sleeve"" for me.

Sat 30 Aug, 12:00 pm - 12:10 pm  10mins

Off the west coast of Pembrokeshire in South Wales, wild rabbits live on sea cliffs alongside seabirds like puffins and seagulls. The rabbits come in many shades, owing to their intriguing history and each spring the island of Skomer itself is transformed by wild flowers, creating one of Britain's most beautiful natural spectacles. The green and brown island turns blue and pink for a couple of spectacular weeks under a carpet of bluebells and red campion. [S]"

"event","The Vuelta starts this weekend and I'll be cheering on Alberto Contador.

As far as Road Racing goes it's special and it's also the ""Grand Tour"" that's had the closest to a British winner.*

Robert Millar was, basically, cheated out of victory in the early 1980s on the final stage by Spanish teams, pay-offs, the Spanish rail system and his own incompetent team manager.

Anyway, venga Alberto, venga.

*The Irish, it should be pointed out, have been far more successful in the past with both Sean Kelly and Stephen Roche. Nicholas Roche looks like he could be almost as good as his dad too."

"event","So, at GenCon we had the <a href=""http://www.booth1940.com"">Design Matters</a> booth.

It was a resounding success. We made money, enough to pay for the booth and more. We had a great, fun time. We created an impression and got noticed -- and we offered con-goers something different from the other booths in the Indie Games Area.

Kevin and Nathan did such a great job in organising the booth. Amy and Clint brought a lot of fun to the booth and some rocking games. Empire of Dust is a BOXED SET and got a lot of love. Eppy kept us all in fits of laughter and Dread was popular -- showing the long tail for sure. Solipsist did well and Best Friends did OK for me, while 3:16 kinda took off and got a real buzz at the con. Without a  demo in sight. I ran one game of it at Games on Demand and the rest of the play was from folks excited to play it, it generated play and that fed back into sales. Everyone seems to be playing it post con too. Shreyas brought some style to our booth too as he ably helped out, and while Jonathan Walton wasn't there his Geiger Counter was a point of inside Indie interest, and was a great reward for buying our games. I also hope that it'll get more attention by being bundled in with other games. It's certainly another way to get Ashcans out there for play. Nathan could have sold more Annalise if he hadn't encountered printer problems and I am still in awe of Kevin's Sweet Agatha.

Greta to meet up with Paul & Shannon, Warren & Bairbre, Jonny & Jules as well as Vincent, Ron, Paul & Danielle, everyone called Matt, Malc, Jeff & Julie, Alexander, Dro, Luke, Thor, etc. etc.

So, best of the con...

* Game: Sweet Agatha, Kevin's interactive fiction masterpiece in gorgeous colour with puzzles and mysteries waiting to be solved in play is just phenomenal.
* Word: Gundam. Well, it sounds like Gundam.
* Meal: Palomino's. The company as much as the food, though the food was good too.
* Hero: John Harper. His dedication to running and playing in a load (15+) games of 3:16 deservedly got him a medal. I hunted around the con to find a jeweler who hand-made these things and I got him the Gold TriCrescent awarded for bravery in the face of bio-warfare.
* Heroine: Amy Garcia's patience on the booth with us boys (and Shreyas) was saintly. :-)
* Local: Davinia, the waitress in the Steak & Shake.
* Foreigner: Jonny Nexus, and his book Game Night being up for an Ennie. Jonny and his lovely wife Jules also got to chat Veganism with Eppy!
* Minis: AT-43. So awesome and anatomically absurd!
* Dice: the click green ones I got at Chessex and then turned up on the Fae Noir fairy's necklace. Spooky!
* Barman: Jeff at the Embassy Suites. Nuff said!

More to follow when Kevin posts his statement about the booth!"

Anyway, at the moment it only seems to be on locked-down places where pirates pirate to each other. But seriously, it's not worth 1-2 pints of beer to buy?

GenCon was a resounding success. I had a few targets going in:

<a href=""http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/bestfriends/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Best Friends</a>: 10 between <a href=""http://www.booth1940.com"" target=""_blank"">Design Matters</a> and <a href=""http://www.indiepressrevolution.com"" target=""_blank"">IPR</a>, the two booths the book was on.
<a href=""http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/"" target=""_blank"">Solipsist</a>: 10-20.
<a href=""http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/threesixteen/index.html"" target=""_blank"">3:16 Carnage Amongst The Stars</a>: 40-60.

I would have been OK with 10 Solipsists and ecstatic with 20. Same for 3:16 at 40 and 60 units.

The actual numbers were:
Best Friends: 15 (8 + 7 <s>however many IPR sold</s>).
Solipsist: 18.
Three Sixteen: 114 + 18 comps.

Just amazing."

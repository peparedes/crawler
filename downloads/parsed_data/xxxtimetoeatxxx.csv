"event","well i hate all of you right now. 
i was feelin like a milli like 20 min ago then i came to the computer and now looking back i should have just stayed home where it doesnt smell like an unknown fart. sick. 
i started el camino lastweek and its really sweet.
i did my crap and took a test and got an A on it. 
it was awesome. kinda. no it was.
a nig needs a job (me) and i hope casey can get me one. 
i went to the work experience class and it was easy . 
this week i had to take a class called life skills (or something) it was at 8:30 and it was a bitch to wake up for. thanks coffee. 
i get 5 credits for taking it so its pretty nice. 
today was the last day and the dude from amnesty int came and talked to me. 
he was nice and i got out of class early to go. 
it seems kinda like a waste of time writing letters to people that probably dont care about what you have to say. why would some official dude in nepal care about some dickheaded teen from ventura had to say? ""oh please let some dude that is trying to bomb crap in your country out so he can... hate america too. and not in the constraints of jail"" we think we are helping soooooo much. i'm there for entertaining conversation, free food, and extra credit. 
GOSH ANYWAYS. 

so im having a great week then i come to the internet. BIG MISTAKE! 
all i do is read depressing livejournals and look at spaces of stupid girls i would fall inlove with if they gave me the slightest attention. the awesome thing is they dont. 
i hate all you bitches... unless you like me, then wanna go on a date? 
no really i am stupid and i hate the part of my life that feels pointless.. 
(all but school really) 

i only have but 2 friends really. brad and casey. yes my brother. 
sweet right? yes i do love him but he is in florida and im so damn bored. 
and i only hang out with brad every once in a while at night. 
the rest of the time is spent sleeping and thinking about what to do. 
i have no one to hang out with during the day. 

sorry this is a lot sadder than i intended it.

sorry that im not into the theater or show tunes.
sorry that we have SOOO MUCH in common... oh wait WE dont.

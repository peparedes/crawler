"event","Lost the last 2 of my wisdom tooth to Dr Sylvia Tay on Monday. But in return, I've got 6days worth of MCs... WOAH! This time isn't like the previous, my cheek is still swollen until today... -.-; The last time I removed the right side, there no swelling or anything. Hope the swelling goes away faster.

I started playing RagnarokOnline again on monday since I've got lotsa free time at home now. In fact I'm writing this journal while I'm resting(in RO hehehe) and of course while waiting for my MIA lil dumbo. Wonder where has she gone to. Was kinda pissed with her reply yesterday before she left. ""gtg bye"" duh... like what the hell, even my friend also better lor. It sound like some people I just know from IRC and wanna quit, so just gave a fast answer. Didn't even bother telling me where is she going to. I know she's in a rush, but just typing ""gtg school now... gonna be late"" takes up so much time. duh. anyway I know she's gonna get angry or pissed when she sees this. I don't care. 

My aunt got some bread from ROTIBOY.com yesterday and that's gonna be my breakfast today. It's really nice, sweet and a bit salty, and crispy on the outside."

"event","Today mark the start of my leaves and MCs!!! 

My computer was down a few days ago due to some unknown reason, but luckily it was recovered yesterday. After formatting the computer, I realised the codec problem which i used to have was gone, meaning i can watch animes now! And that is the start of the next problem. I've got 15eps of Naruto and 15eps of Prince of Tennis to download. My darn sis didn't shut down the computer properly this morning, causing me to lose 10eps of Naruto. DUH! How many times must I tell them, ""WHEN I'M DOWNLOADING THINGS, STAY AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER!!!"". 1gig of anime gone just like that. I think I should download from irc, the ancient and most reliable way.

Anyway, Dumbo flew back le. Miss her a lot. No more mum mum for at least 4months wor. *sigh* No more bao bao and snoggies."

"event","Was at my Grandma house the whole of yesterday. I forgot that it's her birthday and we're supposed to go over in the afternoon and celebrate. Luckily my friends cannot make it for the mahjong session in the afternoon which we originally planned. 
We played mahjong for the whole afternoon and eventually cut the cake at night. All thanks to my sis, she went to ask my uncle to go Devils and my cousin and I got dragged along. They went down first as my mahjong game hasn't end yet. After the game I went home to bathe and drive down. 
Guess what...? I saw a S15 outside while waiting for my sis to come out and sign me in. That sucker even got the turbo cool down installed. COOL! devils always got these kinda cars. Just the other day when I was there, I saw a 6-Series coupe... sigh. I wonder when will i have my S15."

"event","Went to devils last night with my sis and elmo aka David as people in IRC know him. I arrived slightly later with one of my friend Bernard after watching Yi Tian Tu Long Ji at his house. We reached devils around 2215hrs and waited for my sis to come down and sign us in. Once we're up, we order 1 jug of long island tea. Wasn't very expensive since my sis is a member there, the thing cost like only $54 and its quite strong(she asked the bartender mix). The dance floor is pretty much empty at that time, maybe cause its too early. Last week when i went with my sis, it's quite packed around 2130, probably because it's some Flowerpod girl's birthday(saw a couple of them so i thought its some outing). Around 2315, the crowd started to come in and a few girls make it to the dance floor. I wonder, how come it's always the girls who start the ball rolling. At that time my sis already drag elmo to the podium and start doing their stuffs. How come some people like them can just dance without alcohol? We went to join them after we had finished the jug.
I guess I'm quite high at the time, I did everything elmo asked me to... lolz. We not only did we went up to two podiums, I also join them up at the bartop, only that elmo and I were on the chairs instead of the bartop. While we're at the podium, my friends were hitting on these two girls. Why do they always drag me along? Anyway I've got no intention of doing anything like that. The girls seemed to be quite friendly, talked to them and they don't really sounded local(like some aussie grads). After sometime, the podium is getting too crowded, lotsa girls are invading!!! That leaves me and elmo with no choice, but to leave *sob*. But my 2 friends were still staying there (the other friend was CHOW, who came later). We went up to the bartop since thats the only place we can think of that's empty... haha. After we're up, of of my sis friend who has been like the centre of attraction all the time on the podium, pole and bartop came up and join us. Her name is Cherrie or Cherry. I must say, she dances really good, in a seductive way but i don't find her very pretty which my sis thinks otherwise. We left around 0245.
Anyway, I won $34 on Mahjong earlier that day while playing with Wilson aka Ah Boi, Cash and his girlfriend. Tee Hee!!! Bloop!"

"event","Just came back from camp after a long and tiresome day. 
Had to wake up this morning for a national re dedication ceremony. I thought it's supposed to be a parade of something, which is why I went to cut my hair this week, but NO, it's not. It turned out to be just a small little gathering in a lecture theatre and saying the national pledge. STUPID. But look on the bright side, at least I got like extra 3 hours of sleep after the ceremony till 1pm when I went for my lunch and start work... hehe. 
Lunch was good and I'm glad that I managed to wake up in time for it. Our lunch time is from 12pm-1:30pm, I reached the cookhouse at 1pm, hehe. We had western today, 2x fried chicken wings(juicier than normal), black pepper porkchop, lotsa fries and mushroom soup. 
When I reach 42SAR(Singapore Armoured Regiment) workshop, Lao Hei(blackie aka my boss, Master SGT Pandian) is already there and tasking everybody on what to do. I was detailed to help Mike out with the land rover. As I was bring the spares to the land rover, Lao Hei came and ask me to check the trailer cargo for Aaron before he put the trailer on road. I went to find a driver and proceed to checking the trailer. Check check check... AHA! brake lights not working. I pull the harness out and check. The stupid wire was broken AGAIN! Damn I think I must have soldered a trillion times... how many times must I tell them cannot connect the socket that way. ARGH! This time i do everything myself and finally the trailer is ready to go. After everything is finished, I went back over to help Mike out. All I have to do is change the rifle holder. It looks easy and it is easy, cept for the bottom 2 holder which i had to use a drill to remove the rivets. Wonder which idiot did it. Lucky i managed to find some bolts and nuts for it which made the job a lot easier. Before I was done with everything, its almost time to go home! I guess having lotsa things to do is good. Makes you lose track of time. 
And here I am relaxing and kiaoing my ka at home playing gunbound and at the same time writing this blog for someone to read. Back to my gunbound while waiting for the time to pass..."

"event","I made dinner tonight. All of it from start to finish, and Mom didn't try to interfere once. Nothing insanely major, just out familiar chicken and vegetable ""stoup"" or sorts but having to do that work to put it together, as relatively easy as it is, helped calm the tension I was feeling before and the residual tension I had even after finishing that last entry. 

I know I got my daily intake of vegetable today, that's for sure.
I did a white wine infused chicken breast with carrots, onions, corn, peas, red bell pepper, kale and gravy, on a small bed of egg noodles. ...Each time I end up doing a lot of cooking after some tense situation I usually feel better. That's something I get from Mom, for sure. This was after I had decided to dust all the furniture while Justin had been here. Cleaning and cooking are my reflex, default stress coping mechanisms. The latter I know I get that from Mom for sure. I remember that every time I see her insist on moving about the kitchen even when you'd think she'd want to sit and rest after a hectic day.

It looked just like how Mom does it, tasted pretty darn awesome and it gave Mom a chance to sit, read and collect herself as well, after the unpleasantness of everything form earlier."

KaTz993: i just had another ""i'm angry at the world"" moment
melody8h:  why
KaTz993: like, i got the book fully intent on giving it to justin since i know how much he likes it. i get home, go in the shower, and i totally just get angry out of nowhere.
KaTz993: it happened th last time i picked up a book for him. i got all jealous and pissed off
KaTz993: its soooo annoying
melody8h:  ::-(
KaTz993: so i was upset for a while, but then i felt better
KaTz993: its frustrating becausei try to control it
melody8h:  maybe u just need to let it out
melody8h:  maybe controlling it isn't the best thing
KaTz993: yeah probably
KaTz993: lol
melody8h:  poo
melody8h:  sucks
KaTz993: eh i'm o kay now
melody8h:  did u give him the book?
KaTz993: yeah, he's enjoying it
KaTz993: he wanted me to keep the poster though
KaTz993: that was nice of him
melody8h:  did u put it up?
KaTz993: not yet.
KaTz993: i have it out, but not up
melody8h:  i have to say this is definately the best book by far
KaTz993: hahaha
KaTz993: well thats good
KaTz993: if the last one was a letdown, well, thatd be bad
melody8h:  i dont know how theyre gonna make it into a movie tho
melody8h:  i mean, 5 was longer as a book, but there were a lot of subplotts that were omittable
melody8h:  there are no omittable subplots in 7
KaTz993: haha
melody8h:  everything is just the main plot
KaTz993: well they gotta do it now
KaTz993: tsk tsk lol
melody8h:  this movie's gonna be LOOOOOONG
melody8h:  i pity the director
KaTz993: haha
KaTz993: who knows who itll be
melody8h:  probably a nobody
melody8h:  bc any sane director wouldnt do it
KaTz993: hahahaha
KaTz993: thats funny
KaTz993: but probably true
melody8h:  the one thing is there are a lot of scenes that would be so good in a movie... lots of action and suspense... but i just don't know how they're going to pear it down
melody8h:  uhhhg, i wish i could talk to u more about it
melody8h:  lol
melody8h:  i dont think janice even finished it yet
KaTz993: aw sorry!
KaTz993: lol
melody8h:  did u hear that janice's dog died
KaTz993: what? when?
melody8h:  yesterday
melody8h:  poor lady
KaTz993: oh my
melody8h:  janice knew it was coming though
melody8h:  three days ago she said she kept thinking lady was going to die any secont
melody8h:  second
KaTz993: yeah, my aunt's dog is getting near the end
melody8h:  she had a tumor bleeding in her stomach
KaTz993: my dad is pretty much waiting it out
KaTz993: he knows its coming
melody8h:  and she was 16 which is SOOOO old for a peconese
KaTz993: its never easy
KaTz993: oh wow
melody8h:  alright, im gonna go do something... i dunno what... but i dont wanna sit at the comp all day lol
melody8h:  maybe i should scrapbook...
KaTz993: its rainy
KaTz993: lol
melody8h:  yea, its a horrible day
melody8h:  we were supposed to go to the beach with tam's friend
KaTz993: i thought that was yesterday
melody8h:  i know, we kept pushing it back
KaTz993: oh man
KaTz993: that stinks
melody8h:  we were gonna go yesterday but we realized by the time we got out of church it would be kinda late
KaTz993: oh
melody8h:  cuz we had a 20s/30s luncheon for church after service
KaTz993: ah
KaTz993: i was going to say
KaTz993: im sure it wouldn't go THAT late
melody8h:  yea
melody8h:  so we planned out the train for today and everything
melody8h:  then we wake up and its pouring
KaTz993: oh damn
KaTz993: how annoying
melody8h:  so they want us to come into the city and go to MOMA
melody8h:  but really it sucks going to the city when its raining yuck
melody8h:  so we passed on it
KaTz993: aw, well im sure something will work out
KaTz993: this happens to us all the time :-P
melody8h:  well shes leaving tomorrow so we prob wont see her for a while
KaTz993: oh... :(
melody8h:  (personally shes not my favorite of tammy's friends anyway)
melody8h:  shes VERY arrogant
melody8h:  so i dont mind that much
melody8h:  hehe
KaTz993: oh lo
KaTz993: l
KaTz993: hey so you wanna hear something really sweet?
melody8h:  sure
KaTz993: firstly, i didn't even realize it, but ryan and i were on the phone on saturday for over 3 hours lol
melody8h:  hehe
KaTz993: but anyway, we were reflecting 
KaTz993: i said 'well, we've been dating for 4, and i've knwon you for nine
KaTz993: and he said that if he hadn't gotten cold feet the first time he wanted to ask me out, we would have only known each other for a month
KaTz993: maybe even a little less
melody8h:  so he liked u be4 u liked him
KaTz993: well, actually i felt something the first time i met him
KaTz993: i was just distracted with nate at the time
melody8h:  haha
melody8h:  that stinks
melody8h:  stupid nate
KaTz993: hey i didn't know what it would be like anyway
KaTz993: i gave ryan plenty of space in the beginning
KaTz993: remember he hated being touched
KaTz993: at all
melody8h:  yea
KaTz993: and had massive stuff with personal space
KaTz993: so i was totally starting from a friend perspective no matter what lol
KaTz993: but yeah, i was shocked
melody8h:  thats always the best way
KaTz993: in a good way
melody8h:  :-)
KaTz993: yeah we pretty much concluded things worked out well this way
KaTz993: cause his friends know me as a friend, not a girlfriend
melody8h:  seems to be going really well so far
KaTz993: i wrote him another letter last night
KaTz993: cause i was in such a good mood
melody8h:  like an email or a letter letter
KaTz993: an email
KaTz993: i don't have his real address
melody8h:  weird!
melody8h:  what a world we live in
KaTz993: seriusly
KaTz993: i should get it though
melody8h:  yea, i can never remember tammys real adress off the top of my head
melody8h:  i mean her MI one
KaTz993: i personally like real letters a whole lot more
melody8h:  cuz its a 4-digit
KaTz993: oh wow
melody8h:  really?  i thought ud like the email cuz it can talk to you on the comp
melody8h:  so they can say more personal things
KaTz993: well yeah
melody8h:  without having somebody have to read it
KaTz993: but i've always enjoyed real letters
KaTz993: i mean before now
melody8h:  theyre fun to open
melody8h:  mmm i getcha
KaTz993: like the letter you sent me in freshman year
melody8h:  i like both
KaTz993: i still have that
melody8h:  hehe
KaTz993: in the ripped up envelope and all
melody8h:  aww
KaTz993: its fun to keep
melody8h:  yea, i always save emails and then i never read them again, but letters if theyre saved somehow get read
KaTz993: cause you accidentally find them
KaTz993: no one accidentally finds an old email
KaTz993: ;p;
KaTz993: *lol
melody8h:  yea
KaTz993: hey so something else we talked about for a while were lines of personal space
KaTz993: that was fun 
KaTz993: heh
melody8h:  oh yea?
melody8h:  and?
KaTz993: well you were right
KaTz993: ...as usual
melody8h:  haha
melody8h:  well thats why u need me
melody8h:  lol
KaTz993: absolutely
KaTz993: but yeah
melody8h:  so what do u think of that
KaTz993: in our own weird roundabout way of talking about stuff without talking about stuff,
KaTz993: he said he was pretty much fine with anything, within good reason of course
KaTz993: hah. it was pretty funny
melody8h:  well ""good reason"" to you is obviously different than to him
melody8h:  so u need to define your boundaries
melody8h:  for instance.... you'd think it was unreasonable for him to start fingering you without asking you
KaTz993: um yeah
melody8h:  but he wouldnt think it was unreasonable, in fact he would probably love it, if you started touching him
KaTz993: thats just...uh
melody8h:  wihtout asking
KaTz993: i don't know, i had a hard time really trying to get the two of us to really be specific
melody8h:  haha
melody8h:  hopefully ull eventually be able to just talk about it
KaTz993: i mean he knows what i'm talking about
melody8h:  when u can just talk about itll mean u guys are really comfortable with each other
melody8h:  but i think its gonna take a while for you, cuz you don't even like talking about it to ur gfs
KaTz993: yeah i guess. but i mean thas just cause none of them want to hear about it
melody8h:  thats not true!!  girls ALWAYS talk about that stuff
melody8h:  thats the stereotype and in all cases iv found it true
melody8h:  except for you
melody8h:  but thats cool
KaTz993: yeah but its different
KaTz993: like, i talk to you about it because we're really close and cause i can get something out of it when i tlak to you
KaTz993: if i talk to them, we'll they've all been single like me forever
KaTz993: so it just sounds like me bragging or whatever
KaTz993: and no one can relate
KaTz993: so its kinda weird
melody8h:  no, im just saying, ur afraid to say ""the words"" u like whisper them... ur like embarassed of saying those words, while most girls i know, while they may be discreet in public, can just spit them out in small social gatherings while we're having girl talk
KaTz993: eh, its another old habit
KaTz993: and old habits die hard
melody8h:  yea, nothing wrong with it of course... but it makes it hard to talk about stuff
melody8h:  and u need to talk about stuff clearly in order to get the most out of stuff
melody8h:  u cant give a good blow job without talking about it... lol
KaTz993: in any case, i'm thinking maybe we'll get better with it during the school year
KaTz993: when we're around each other all the time
melody8h:  yea, the more time u spend together the more comfortable you get
KaTz993: i mean we pretty much were just massive hot for each other for 3 days straight when iw ent to see him, but we;ve gone a month apart again
KaTz993: so it's inconsistent. 
melody8h:  anyway.... are you planning on touching his dick any time soon?
melody8h:  (i tried to be blunt to get u over ur fear a bit)
KaTz993: haha that's straightforward for you
KaTz993: i cant' say i haven't thought about it
melody8h:  lol i commented on ur comment be4 u even commented
KaTz993: damn we're psychic
KaTz993: ;)
melody8h:  so what are you thinking.... are you gonna wait until the school year starts?
melody8h:  or just go for it when he comes
KaTz993: i don't know
KaTz993: maybe
KaTz993: it depends
melody8h:  on...?
KaTz993: on what happens when he gets here
melody8h:  well all i have to say is, DO NOT leave it up to the heat of the moment
melody8h:  always plan things out
melody8h:  bc u may regret things later if u just go for it
KaTz993: wait, i have to plan this? isn't that a bit weird?
melody8h:  just plan on when ur gonna
melody8h:  dont wait
KaTz993: i mean i wanted to talk just so weird moments wouldn't come up
melody8h:  u dont have to plan HOW
melody8h:  just plan WHEN
KaTz993: oh lol
melody8h:  bc ppl say, oh ill just see what happens, and then of course u get really hot and horny and u just do it and then later ur like, omg should i have done that?
melody8h:  if u plan out when ur gonna ull be confident and you wont have 2nd thoughts later
KaTz993: uh ok. 
KaTz993: i guess i just thought people don't put that much thought in it
melody8h:  well some ppl dont
KaTz993: i mean he certainly didn't plan out when he was gonna feel me up the first time
KaTz993: he just did it after we were really caught up in making out
melody8h:  im not saying u have to plan the exact day or anything like that
KaTz993: 'and then afterward was like 'holy shit, i just did that?'
melody8h:  u just have to know BEFORE you start making out and stuff if you're ready
melody8h:  you have to tell urself u are
melody8h:  and be sure of it
melody8h:  if u haven't said ur sure of it be4 hand, if u just let it happen, u may feel guilt, uncertainty, lack of confidence, etc
melody8h:  u might feel it while its happening, or after its happening
melody8h:  sex and sexual activities are like a drug to your brain
KaTz993: ...
melody8h:  it can make u do things you wouldnt otherwise do... like when alchohol can make u be bolder
melody8h:  u dont wanna do something that later ur gonna say, man i shouldve thought about that
KaTz993: like sex. lol
melody8h:  and i mean, this is just touching him, no big deal right, but if u dont start planning this stuff out now then when you go further and further, if you dont plan things u might end up having sex
KaTz993: really?
KaTz993: i cant' imagine myself not having that much self control
melody8h:  wait till u have an orgasm
melody8h:  you pretty much loose your mind
KaTz993: if you say so
melody8h:  lol
KaTz993: (not that i don't believe you :-P)
melody8h:  im just saying, this is the first time ur gonna go this far with a guy, shouldn't u know 100 percent before you do
melody8h:  some ppl consider it sex
melody8h:  once u start touching private parts, thats a pretty big deal
melody8h:  u want to be sure you're ready
KaTz993: yeah, actually now that i think about it, it's not really like me not to want to think this out a lot
KaTz993: its just really gray i guess
melody8h:  i know, i was surprised you thought this was weird advice
melody8h:  i thought u would say ""duh!""
KaTz993: i'm kinda mixed up
melody8h:  u want it to be spontaneous and romantic
melody8h:  thats y u want it to ""just happen""
KaTz993: cause if i think about it i know i'll back out
melody8h:  why
KaTz993: i'm so not the most confident person ever
KaTz993: i'm the queen of second thoughts 
melody8h:  if you think you'll back out then you're probably not ready
KaTz993: i don't even know what i think
melody8h:  if you think you'll back out then you might regret it after you've done it
melody8h:  wouldn't it be horrible to regret having done something with ryan
KaTz993: my mind changes a million times a day
melody8h:  that could seriously hurt your relationship
KaTz993: and no, i'm not just tlaking about that specific thing
melody8h:  what are you talking about
KaTz993: i'm just being general 
melody8h:  oh
melody8h:  you need to really think hard about the reasons you are doubting yourself about this
KaTz993: like, sometimes i want him so bad. but other times, i mellow out and i'm just thinking itd be nice to sit and talk and be around each other
KaTz993: my mind goes crazy
melody8h:  is it a moral reason, or a personal reason, or a sexual reason
melody8h:  once u know the reasons you can move forward
melody8h:  for instance, u say you're not confident, but what is it that you're not confident about?
melody8h:  if its that you wont be good at touching him, that takes you to one place, if it's that you're afraid of tainting your ""purity"" thats another route, and if its that you have a fear of the unknown, thats again something else, or maybe u think it will do something to your relationship that you're not sure you want to be done
KaTz993: i just freak every once in a while about aiccdentally being in a bad situation. i mean we said it. we dont' want the other being in a situation of ""omg don't ever do that again.""
KaTz993: i think we're just afraid of messing with each other's space or something along those lines
melody8h:  so that's it, thats the whole reason?
melody8h:  its just your afraid he wont like it?
KaTz993: yeah
KaTz993: one sec
melody8h:  okay, well then i think ur pretty much ready personally, but ur relationship isnt ready for it, you need to talk more to him about it first
KaTz993: as far as your reasoning above, even my mom said there's plenty of ways to be intimate without sex
melody8h:  what reasoning?
KaTz993: and no, just so you know i don't consider that sex 
KaTz993: the stuff about purity and morality and stuff
melody8h:  i know YOU don't
melody8h:  im just saying its a pretty big deal
melody8h:  i was saying some ppl consider it sex to let u know that it actually is a big step
melody8h:  not something to take lightly and go with the flow
KaTz993: yeah
KaTz993: so am i rushing?
melody8h:  but like i said, i think u are personally ready
melody8h:  you are ready to take the next step
melody8h:  but ur relationship is not
melody8h:  if u are nervous about his space that means you two are not comfortable enough together to go there
melody8h:  you have to talk about it, you have to become unembarassed to talk about it with him
melody8h:  and its not something u can force yourself or him or both of u to do
KaTz993: well like i said, i figured that
KaTz993: i mean three days of adrenline isnt' going to all of a sudden make that okay
KaTz993: so i'm thinking it probably won'thappen til sometime during school
KaTz993: cause i think we were just emotionally overexcited and what have you
melody8h:  yea... but the thing is, not adrenaline, but the other sexual hormones could put u in a state where u might ""go for it"" without being confident, if u dont tell urself u wont do it
melody8h:  so my advice is this, talk to him more about it on the phone, try to get comfortable really talking about it without skirting around the edges
melody8h:  when hes at ur house talk to him about it in person
melody8h:  decide whether or not u will do it BEFORE you start making out
KaTz993: haha ok
KaTz993: i figure it might be easier to talk about in person
melody8h:  yea
melody8h:  ok enough about this particular subject
KaTz993: haha
melody8h:  i have a tangent convo
KaTz993: ok
melody8h:  why exactly do u want to wait to have sex
melody8h:  what is it about sex that is so different from other sexual encounters (i.e. blow job, hand job)
KaTz993: well, 
melody8h:  (in no way shape or form am i trying to change your mind.... i just wanna have a discussion)
KaTz993: i'm not saying im necessarily okay with a blow job or whatever else yet either
KaTz993: just for the record
melody8h:  i know not YET
melody8h:  but like u said, u dont consider those sex
KaTz993: uh i don't think im eant that
KaTz993: one sec
melody8h:  ok
KaTz993: i'm thinking things through one thing at a time.
melody8h:  meaning?
KaTz993: meaning
KaTz993: lol
melody8h:  omg
melody8h:  this is creepy
KaTz993: moving forward, boxers over dick not sex
KaTz993: boxers off, not sex
KaTz993: blowjob, not sex, but not something i want to do
KaTz993: and well, sex is sex lol
KaTz993: so that's that. just so we're clear
melody8h:  wait... huh?
melody8h:  im confused
KaTz993: ugh\
melody8h:  i read that like 4 times
melody8h:  trying to get it
KaTz993: ok youre asking me about why i don't want to have sex
melody8h:  right
melody8h:  okay, without referring to all the ""other stuff""
KaTz993: and i think we lost being on the same page about me and ""other stuff""
melody8h:  just the question, why do you want to wait to have sex? without tying in other stuff
KaTz993: oh ok
melody8h:  and later we can tie it in
KaTz993: for a bunch of reasons
KaTz993: being catholic is part of it
melody8h:  those reasons being?
KaTz993: it just is. i was brought up that way, so it sticks
melody8h:  okay, but saying ""being catholic is part of it"" doesn't mean anyting really
KaTz993: to me it does
melody8h:  well what sticks
melody8h:  it doesnt say WHY being catholic made u that way
melody8h:  bc many many many catholics dont wait
KaTz993: they tell you wait til marriage, i'm catholic, so i wait. its supposed to be saved for your wedding night with the person you will spend the rest of your life with
melody8h:  so being catholic isn't a reason
melody8h:  do u follow all catholic rules?
KaTz993: no
melody8h:  so why that one
melody8h:  thats what i want to know
melody8h:  how come thats a catholic rule that you follow while you dont follow others
melody8h:  its not just ""that you're catholic""
KaTz993: well because it ties in with my personal line
melody8h:  whats ur personal line
KaTz993: i personally don't want to give away some seriously spiritual and emotional experience to someone and then potentially not have ties with them forever. cause i can't get that back
KaTz993: i think me havign sex with someone means that i'm giving them my ultimate sing of trust and love and that i don't feel same way about anyone else. that they're ""the one"" 
melody8h:  okay... this is taking me deeper into the answer... so why is sex so seriously spiritual
melody8h:  kira?
KaTz993: its the deepest sign of physical intimacy you can give. it has to do with how i feel within myself. if i didn't have my own personal spirit and heart and mind, then sex would jjust be that. a physical act
KaTz993: and i could just do it with anybody and there'd be nothing attached. itd be for chemical satisfaction only
KaTz993: and obviously i don't feel that empty about it
KaTz993: and sorry, i was just really trying to think my words out
KaTz993: that was a complicated one
melody8h:  do u think its a law of nature that sex is the ""deepest sign of physical intimace"" or something sociologically developed and burned into your psyche from the outside
KaTz993: um a little of both
melody8h:  because if you think about it, anything could be ""the ultimate sign of physical intamacy"" if society believed it to be that way... what if ppl had sex all the time but never kissed until they were in love, or something like that
KaTz993: touche
melody8h:  no no, im not trying to argue
KaTz993: i know
melody8h:  im trying to get at the deeper meaning
KaTz993: but that is an extemely valid point
melody8h:  so do u think society is playing a huge role in your decision, and of course it is completely okay if you say yes, in fact, you pretty much did when u said it was being catholic
KaTz993: heh
KaTz993: yes society has made a huge impression on my line of thinking
KaTz993: but it doesn't change that i do ideally want sex to be with one person, and one person only
KaTz993: my virginity is something i will only have once
melody8h:  ahh yes, i thought u might bring that up
melody8h:  this is my question about that
KaTz993: damn, its like i walked into a trap.
KaTz993: im that predictible huh
melody8h:  yes you will only have ur virginity once, but you also only had ur first kiss once, ur first touch of someones sex organs once, your first ""i love you"" once... how come virginity is more ultimately important than any of those things
melody8h:  its not that YOU are predictable, its that THAT is exactly what catholics teach their children about why not to have sex
KaTz993: thats true. but why do you think i was so angry after nathan burned me so hard
melody8h:  they make you feel like if u give it away you cant get it back and it wont mean as much to the next person
KaTz993: i was stuck in this mindset of idealism
KaTz993: that if i fianlly felt comfortable enough with someone (considering how closed up i am) that it meant something
KaTz993: and it wouldn't just crash and burn in two seconds
melody8h:  yes, but that doesn't answer my question... you didn't wait until you were POSITIVE he was the only one ud ever kiss
melody8h:  but you are going to wait until you're positive with sex
melody8h:  you're not going to wait until you're positive to say ""i love you""
melody8h:  why is that
KaTz993: well touche again
KaTz993: but i do have something for that
melody8h:  yay
melody8h:  what
KaTz993: i was going to say at firt, because i feel like i could love him. and then i figured you'd say something like ""well do you think he'll be only person would could love? like the only one in world ever?""
KaTz993: but to that end i'm thinking, i could get close to ryan and value him in my life enough to say i love you with 100% sincerity, but love isn't the same ting as sex
KaTz993: you can love more than one person over the course of life and it can be with the same kind of intensity and realism
melody8h:  but...?
KaTz993: and you can only get more of it when you spend more time with someone
melody8h:  .....
KaTz993: and i'm not saying sex with a different person couldn't also be sincere, but you have it and then 
KaTz993: ehm i lost my wordflow
melody8h:  haha
melody8h:  keep goin
KaTz993: ugh i know what i want to say but i can't piece it together right
KaTz993: one sec
KaTz993: okay
KaTz993: i can say with total sincerity that i love you heather, and obviously i have said it to other people before you, and have said it to other people after you
KaTz993: but i don't think of saying ""i love you"" and expressing that to someone as giving one ""it"" away
KaTz993: my feeling of love for someone isn't a single entity. 
KaTz993: meanwhile, my virginity is. even if sex with a second partner for whatever resaon, is still given with toal sincerity
melody8h:  ahhh loving, not, but being ""in"" love COULD, im not saying it necessarily is, but you could be ""in"" love with one person while loving many
KaTz993: *whew* there i think i said what i meant
KaTz993: wait, it had been so long since you said someone i lost your continuity
melody8h:  but the point is well taken
melody8h:  no, i was responding to you
melody8h:  you're saying you can love many so saying ""i love you"" doesn't count as a first, cuz you've said it to other people you love... however, doesn't it mean something more important when u mean you are ""in love"" with someone?
melody8h:  but moving on
melody8h:  what about a kiss then
melody8h:  how come you can kiss many
melody8h:  you dont kiss me
melody8h:  lol
KaTz993: hahaha 
KaTz993: um
KaTz993: well i getting to that
KaTz993: i don't know how i feel about that.
KaTz993: because i do definitely take kissing more seriously than most people
KaTz993: case and point why i was so infuriated with nate being clueless about hurting my feelings for so long 
KaTz993: because to me, even though that wasn't sex, it was still me opening up to a level i hadn't and i did, in a way, feel like i lost something
melody8h:  i mean, honestly, you can put more feelings of love and trust into the act of a kiss than to the act of sex... physically speaking (not emotionally speaking because that depends on the person)
KaTz993: i mean, you were trying to convince me for a while that i was just caught up in something
KaTz993: that i would like it soooo much better the next time
KaTz993: and it just gets better
melody8h:  was it BECAUSE of the kiss that you lost something, or was it because you trusted him and he failed you
KaTz993: but, for while, i did feel like i gave up something
KaTz993: both tied together
KaTz993: me doing that meant i trusted him 
melody8h:  did u feel like you gave up ""a kiss"" or you gave up ""your first kiss""
KaTz993: the latter
KaTz993: like, i was really emotionally invested in that at the time
KaTz993: now its slightly confusing (for lack of a better word) because you were right, compared to that, at this time with ryan has been better to an indescriable degree
KaTz993: but even more so, i would get annoyed that i pursued nate when, on some level, my mind was trying to tell me something about ryan and i could have had a good emotional experience with him, and not been shot down
melody8h:  so lets say completely hypothetically ryan suddenly revealed himself as a complete asshole and completely broke your heart... would you feel liek you gave away more in the kisses with him or more with nate bc his was your first
KaTz993: like, i wish i had kissed him first instead of nate
KaTz993: cause to me the thing with nate now means nothing 
KaTz993: cause he wasn't emotionally invested in it
KaTz993: he was just messing around
KaTz993: hm
KaTz993: i think i would still feel more strongly about nate
KaTz993: because again, i coudl hypothetically be in multiple relationships
KaTz993: and if more than one guy turns out to be a jerk, then thats that
melody8h:  bc u would believe at least on some level that ryan cared at one point and nate didn't, or bc it was ur first kiss?
KaTz993: well i believed at some point that nate did care
melody8h:  im trying to get at the idea of ""first"" bc thats what virginity is all about
melody8h:  its important bc when u lose it, it will never be ur first again
KaTz993: so i got burned. the first time you get burned it hurts. but once its happened a few times its not as bad. 
KaTz993: yes hypothetically ryan could break away and stuff
KaTz993: and that would hurt
KaTz993: but ideally
KaTz993: actually ignore that last sentence for a moment
melody8h:  ok
KaTz993: but that doesn't take away from being burned the first time when you didn't know what it felt like
KaTz993: i'm still ""sad"" that i gave away my first and it wasn't with someone who reciprocated 
KaTz993: i mean, yes, even if nate and i did get together he could break up with me anytime after that
melody8h:  the thing with virginity is christianity, other religions, and society in general, have turned virginity into this object-like thing, they turn it into something that you actually phsyically have, that someone else can take away, and once they do its lost forever... what is this magical thing, this virginity, that someone can take away, that people say is the most sacred and important thing.  i honestly believe many people care more about the idea of giving away their virginity to their husband than the idea of having him be their only sexual partner for life
KaTz993: but at least, in the moment, if he and i were where ryan and i are now, i could feel, at least for now, that i opened up to someone who i'm living like they will last
KaTz993: well i don't personally look at it like an object. but i do find it symbolic of a gift to my only sexual partner 
melody8h:  yes, so what does that mean
melody8h:  how is it a gift, what is it in actuallity
melody8h:  what are you GIVING them
melody8h:  what do they have once you don't have it
melody8h:  what do they have that, lets say, the second or third person you have sex with, doesn't have
KaTz993: that whoever the person is i'm giving them my pure self 
melody8h:  what do u mean by pure
KaTz993: oh wow you're making this hard lol
KaTz993: i knew you were goingt to ask that
KaTz993: and i was trying to beat you to the punch
melody8h:  haha
KaTz993: this is the freakiest conversation ever
KaTz993: in that, its new.
melody8h:  but the ""mystery"" of virginity boggles me, the fact that you can GIVE it to someone, the fact that it will be ""someone's"" is just so odd, that the first person you have sex with has ""something"" that nobody else that you have sex with has
KaTz993: it's something i'll do that i haven't ever done before and really i guess that reasoning is directed more toward myself than my future partner, whoever they are
melody8h:  do you agree with the terminology society uses?
KaTz993: that they can know i'm experiencing something so amazing with them first
KaTz993: really that reasoning of mine is more of a thing for myself
KaTz993: not always i guess
melody8h:  i mean, if u had sex with ryan, would u agree with me if i said ""ryan took kira's virginity"" or lets say you were raped by a guy named mike could i say ""mike stole kira's virginity""
melody8h:  do u agree with those sentances or not
KaTz993: well i think they could be worded more eloquently
KaTz993: to express their real emotional meaning rather than refer to an imaginary object
melody8h:  sure... but still
KaTz993: but stole i think is still appropriate
melody8h:  do u think they represent the truth
melody8h:  because to say ryan took it or mike stole it, it means they now HAVE it
KaTz993: i mean, if i want to choose to no experience sex until i'm with someone foever, and a jerk rapes me, then i didn't get to keep my personal choice
KaTz993: someone made it for me
KaTz993: which is like stealing
melody8h:  i didnt say kira ""lost"" her virginity, if you lost it who knows where it is, gone i guess, but if ryan ""took"" it it means he has it
KaTz993: i said before
KaTz993: the idea of ""taking/giving virginty is something i'm look at more for myself rather than my partner
melody8h:  you said he has the experience of your first time
melody8h:  but, if you think about it that way, so do you
KaTz993: okay i don't mean that he actually has anything
melody8h:  you have that expericne too, you were there, so you still have it then if virginity is an expericne
KaTz993: its something i know i have with him
melody8h:  okay, so you share it
KaTz993: yes
melody8h:  good
melody8h:  thats a good way to put it
KaTz993: a first is only new to you once
KaTz993: and i want to say that i'm still with the person who i had that first, new experience with
melody8h:  so do you care more about ""sharing"" your virginity with your future husband, or about him being the only one you ever have sex with
KaTz993: answer number 1
KaTz993: because we both know life happens
KaTz993: if a partner dies or something equally final, you can't have sex with them anymore
melody8h:  okay... answer me this..... if you did get raped, would you then consider it okay to not wait for mairrage to have sex, because your virginty is gone; i'm not saying ud have sex with anyone, but someone you really care about and love that you're not yet married to
KaTz993: but that doesn't mean you can grow to love someone and feel like they are someone you can share the same level of emotional connection with
KaTz993: no
KaTz993: i would still want it to be with someone i was with forever
melody8h:  why
melody8h:  as u just said, it might not be forever even in mairrage
KaTz993: yes, you didn't get to choose to have sex if youre raped, (and that can hurt for a long time) but that doesn't mean you can't still want to have it with someone you believe will be forever
KaTz993: because sex after rape won't be ""physically"" new, but it can certainly still be emotionally new with whoever the partner is
KaTz993: because goodness knows rape is not a happy and loving way to have sex
KaTz993: you're not experiencing the emotional newness of it when your'e being raped
melody8h:  yes, but cant it be emotionally new with any new partner because obviously each relationship you have will be a totally new experience, a totally new way to love
KaTz993: ah
KaTz993: you heather, are a most formidible conversationalist
melody8h:  haha lol, and so r u
KaTz993: and i will completely agree with that statement
KaTz993: because you're right. everyone is different
melody8h:  the mystery of sex is complicated to crack, and i am especially interested bc of the fact that people will wait to have vaginal sex but not to do other things that tammy and i consider our most personal and deep form of loving
KaTz993: if a widow to many husbands kept treating them all like husband number one, well the relationship would dry up anyway because she would be caught in the old, comparing everyone in the present and future to the past
melody8h:  quite true
KaTz993: well therein lies validation to one of your points
KaTz993: what if society said kissing was the ultimate physical act
melody8h:  so honestly, do u think there is some innate thing in your genes, in the way god created you, that says wait for the one right person before you have sex, or do u think its a socially constructed idea that youve been exposed to since you were born that is ingrained in your societal and social belief system
KaTz993: homosexuality is not what is ingrained into society's teachings. so your most personal and intimate and emotional acts with tammy aren't demeaned because of society's focuse on vaginal sex, they are just as special, its just the two are placed on different pages
melody8h:  no no no, kira!  im not trying to say that ours are demeaned by others doings
melody8h:  no no
melody8h:  not at all
KaTz993: i think society has been controlling human mindset
melody8h:  but that is the reason i am INTERESTED in the idea
KaTz993: i mean right now society is reflecting that sex all the time is typical 
melody8h:  its the reason i started this conversation with you, because it interests me, not because i feel you are demeaning us by thinking of going farther, no not in any way shape or form
KaTz993: at the same time as with little kids that are raised to think the complete opposite
melody8h:  depending on which branch of society you focus on
KaTz993: oh and no, i didn't think that you were thinking i was demeaning you
melody8h:  yes but you thought i thought society was
KaTz993: i was just saying i could understand why you would/could think that
KaTz993: yea i guess so
KaTz993: brb
KaTz993: back
melody8h:  hey
KaTz993: so where were we
melody8h:  ummm, well before you thought i was demeaned...
KaTz993: lol
KaTz993: okay i don't think that anymore
melody8h: so honestly, do u think there is some innate thing in your genes, in the way god created you, that says wait for the one right person before you have sex, or do u think its a socially constructed idea that youve been exposed to since you were born that is ingrained in your societal and social belief system  
KaTz993: i was just empathizing momentarily
melody8h: thats what i said last
KaTz993: and i was leaning toward society
KaTz993: i would like to think its God, but honestly God is something i can't possibly fathom
KaTz993: if that is why things are how they are, they He knows it and its there already ingrained and society is just screwing with it
KaTz993: always has been always will be
melody8h:  the reason i dont think its ingrained in our genes from God is that every culture looks at sex and mairrage differently
melody8h:  after all, many times wives are bought
KaTz993: true
melody8h:  many times marital love is not a part of a society
KaTz993: also true
melody8h:  many times there is polygamy
KaTz993: also true
KaTz993: lol
melody8h:  yet in most cultures virginity is still important
melody8h:  even with polygamy, virginity is important in the wives, not the husband obviously
KaTz993: lol
melody8h:  i almost feel as if the objectification of virginity has been a sexist-motivated societal flaw
KaTz993: do you feel like you shared your virginity with tammy, or do you feel it was shared beforehand. because i think this rools with you're statement of loving someone and having sex before marriage
KaTz993: just wondering
melody8h:  well chris and i had sex, so no, tammy was not my ""first""
melody8h:  if i went and had vaginal sex with another boy i would consider him my third sexual partner, not my second
KaTz993: but i know how much you love tammy, so emotionally you'd say she was your first?
melody8h:  i loved chris too, in a completely different way... i could say i THOUGHT i loved him... but at this point i dont know which is more true
melody8h:  it wasnt love like the love i have for tammy... but does that mean it wasnt love?
KaTz993: ah okay, so even you agree somewhat that you gave away your new experience with chris
KaTz993: even though we know you found a deep emotional connection with tammy afterward
melody8h:  no, i dont think the experience i had with tammy was any less new because of the experience i had with chris
KaTz993: and that you have sex with her and it is just as, if not more, emotional intense
melody8h:  if thats what ur asking
melody8h:  i didnt feel like i had already had that experience
melody8h:  the experience was profoundly different
melody8h:  moreso emotionally than physically
KaTz993: and we're not just talking physcal reasons
KaTz993: ...
KaTz993: ahh omg
melody8h:  the difference between having sex with chris and tammy was just as differnet as the expericne of kissing and having sex with tammy
melody8h:  not to say kissing tammy and having sex with chris are similar in any way shape or form, theyre just very differnt
KaTz993: so you don't feel you ""lost"" anything other than the simple fact that you had sexual intercourse with chris first
melody8h:  to me, ""first"" doesnt really matter
melody8h:  im not saying im completely okay with the fact that i had sex with chris
melody8h:  but its not because he was my first and i lost something that i cant get back
KaTz993: i'm not focusing on that, just stating a fact
KaTz993: because for you it's emotionally and physically new regardless
KaTz993: which is fine. i was just figuring some stuff out i guess
melody8h:  okay, then the answer is, no i don't feel like i ""lost anything""  there was no magical thing that left me when i had sex with him, no secret spirit of purity that left my body
KaTz993: well i was aiming at that either
KaTz993: *wasnt
melody8h:  okay... well then what
KaTz993: its like what i said with nate before. like, i'll still kiss other guys, but i was experiencing something i never had so anyone after that can be just as emotional, but its not exactly the same frame of mind i was in the first time i did it 
KaTz993: not that kissing and sex ar the same thing
KaTz993: but anyway, you don't feel that ways. but that's all i was getting at
KaTz993: i'm not actually disagreeing or anything 
melody8h:  yea, i get it, its just... sure you wont be in the same frame of mind the second time you do it, but that doesnt diminish the second frame of mind at all
KaTz993: and thats why i get what youre saying
KaTz993: each person is uniquely different, so you can't compare them
KaTz993: it's like apples and oranges
melody8h:  right
KaTz993: which can apply to anyone
KaTz993: but i guess there is still a small piece of me that connects experiences together
KaTz993: despite the above
melody8h:  the thing with saving sex for mairrage to me is i both agree and disagree with it
KaTz993: i mean i'm probably the worst person to make a frame of reference because i have practically none
melody8h:  and its fun talking to you about it becuse most people who agree with it will state catholic doctrine and will only argue those points with me and it turns into a debate on whether you should follow the rules or not, but with you, you're not all about that
KaTz993: i mean ryan is like my first relationship too
melody8h:  so its fun
KaTz993: yeah it is
KaTz993: i mean it's not right o just argue the same thing over and over
KaTz993: because obviously is everyone thought the way a person did, thered be no argument
melody8h:  the idea is a little perplexing to me bc of my ""personal philosophy of life"" which i've said before when janice was telling u to masterbate, which is to try to focus as little as possible on the physical word and concentrate on the spiritual... and sex is a physical act, no matter what anyone says
melody8h:  there is no emotion IN sex that cannot exist WITHOUT sex
KaTz993: aha
melody8h:  yes there are emotions in sex, but they are emotions you BRING to sex, not ones that are inherent in the act
KaTz993: yes, but i have to admit, they must be awfully intertwined
melody8h:  yes, but since you bring those emotions to sex, you could, theoretically, bring them to any act, physical or non
melody8h:  of course if you're talking lust, that would be only physical
KaTz993: absolutely
KaTz993: well in that case i will definitely disagree now
melody8h:  but u can still bring all emotions, including lust, to a non-sex experience
KaTz993: i don't think i'm lusting after ryan
KaTz993: i sorta talked with him about that too
KaTz993: and he said exactly what i should have told myself to totally think
melody8h:  kira, its impossible NOT to lust after ur own boyfriend
melody8h:  even if its a little
melody8h:  if you experiene physical reactions to his touch, that is lust
melody8h:  that is what lust is
KaTz993: he was saying to me, no of course we don't just desire to be physical. you have emotional and personal ties to someone and that's what makes you deisre them physically
KaTz993: which actually is what you said too, i just am glad he was on the same page
KaTz993: turning angles slightly, 
melody8h:  grr.. u just said ur not lusting after him, but u do desire to express your sexuality to him, correct?
KaTz993: ahh ok ok so it is lust
melody8h:  haha
melody8h:  anyway
melody8h:  back on the subject
melody8h:  but actually, to tie in lust
KaTz993: haha ok
melody8h:  the problem with sex being the one ultimate love act (for me) is that it does tie in lust, which is a somewhat greedy emotion: want
melody8h:  i think lust is fine, normal, etc
melody8h:  i like having it and i dont think its wrong
melody8h:  BUT, wouldnt a stronger sign of love be something that has nothing to do with lust?
melody8h:  (of course this is a matter of opinion)
KaTz993: well it can or cannot
KaTz993: i mean you strongly love and show sings of love to people who you don't have sex with
melody8h:  to me, doing something completely selfless would show love stronger than to do something that has some selfish ties to it
KaTz993: so yes i believe there are things you can do and show that are just as strong signs without the physical lusting
melody8h:  the thing is, would it be selfish to reserve something selfless for one person?
KaTz993: wow
KaTz993: thats a really profound insight
KaTz993: it almost sounds like a paradox
melody8h:  well i was trying to think of something that would substitute for sex
melody8h:  but i couldnt think of anything
melody8h:  something that people could save for mairrage
melody8h:  i think the only thing is mairrage itself...
melody8h:  but is that completely selfless
melody8h:  ?
melody8h:  you're promising to give your life to them
melody8h:  so i guess so
KaTz993: its another shared experience
KaTz993: you can't get married alone
KaTz993: so someone has to promise to be involved
KaTz993: but depending on the degree, it can be selfish
KaTz993: like arranged marriages
melody8h:  it depends who you are
melody8h:  you could be marrying for money
melody8h:  but the same goes for sex
melody8h:  we're talking idealism here obviously
melody8h:  so we have to assume they are marrying for the right reasons
KaTz993: because you could look at it as giving youself to someone, or that someone could seeit as taking you
melody8h:  bc in talking sex we haven't talked about people who are just doing it for enjoyment, we're talking about you and me
KaTz993: one is selfless one is selfish
melody8h:  ahhh... i think i will not use traditional vows... ""do you take this person...."" because it should read ""do you give yourself to this person....""
melody8h:  if vows were read like that then agreeing to them would be selfless
melody8h:  i agree to give my whole self to you
melody8h:  instead of, i am taking your whole self
KaTz993: ahhhh
KaTz993: youre right
KaTz993: thats horribly written
KaTz993: omg
melody8h:  lol
KaTz993: *flail*
KaTz993: haha
melody8h:  but in agreeing to let them take you, you are being selfless
KaTz993: aha
KaTz993: there's a paradox
melody8h:  however, during the vows, during the mairrage itself you are not agreeing for them to take you, you just agree to take
melody8h:  while you do imply it it is never specifically said
KaTz993: hmm
KaTz993: so vows are badly written
KaTz993: lol
KaTz993: that we can agree on
melody8h:  haha
melody8h:  yup
KaTz993: so now i'm going to shift angles a bit
melody8h:  ok
KaTz993: with all this talk of personal reasoning...
KaTz993: i have to say i'm mixedly openminded at times about sexuality
KaTz993: how its defined or not
KaTz993: which is a knot in itself i know
KaTz993: but it gets me thinking, is it all a case to case basis?
melody8h:  well thats one thing im sure of, that it is
melody8h:  sex means something different to most everyone
KaTz993: the reason i ask is because i think i finally really understand what you mean when you explain how you just fell in love with tammy and had never been that way before 
KaTz993: to be humourous for a second a quote the L word ""most girls are straight until their not, and gay until they're not""
melody8h:  haha
melody8h:  when u said ""and had never been that way before"" you mean me being straight before?
KaTz993: yes
melody8h:  ahh
KaTz993: i hope that didn't come out crudely
melody8h:  no.. i just thought at first that you meant the sex was totally different
melody8h:  but explain to me how u understand it now, what did you think before?
KaTz993: well its not that i thought something different before, i just get it better now
KaTz993: and i'm getting to it, don't worry
KaTz993: well, i dont' mean to say i ""just got it"" it just occured in my mind during this whole conversation
melody8h:  what occured?
KaTz993: this thought
melody8h:  tell me the thought
KaTz993: i'm getting to it
KaTz993: lol
melody8h:  lol
KaTz993: and how it ties in with my whole mixed take on sexuality in general and that l word quote and such
KaTz993: did i ever tell you about the thing my friend said to me about loving someone you admire? when i got all freaked out because i was thinking about her in a way thats not just friends?
melody8h:  yea
KaTz993: like that freaked me out at first
KaTz993: but she said it was normal
KaTz993: and that it happens
melody8h:  so were u okay with it?
KaTz993: yeah
melody8h:  eventually?
KaTz993: yeah
KaTz993: to be honest
KaTz993: when i thought about what she had said, and about myself, i realized that it does happen. and it can just be out of nowhere
KaTz993: with a particular person
melody8h:  so where does this convo tie in
KaTz993: i shifted it a bit
KaTz993: i'm talking about sexuality now
melody8h:  ohhh
KaTz993: maybe it's not totally related
KaTz993: i was tryihng to make a decent segway
melody8h:  well i thought u had this big understanding from this convo
melody8h:  haha
melody8h:  i get it now
KaTz993: well sorta
KaTz993: anway
melody8h:  i think people who are very physical, who set their mind on material things, who value their bodies and minds over their souls, they have set sexualities, gay or straight, however if you are living with an eye on the non-physical world, if you care more about your thoughts and actions than the things you possess, if you are interested more in people's souls than bodies, than you can go either way
KaTz993: the reason i was okay with what she was telling me was because when i thought about it, i realized i had had similar thoughts before
KaTz993: yeah pretty much
KaTz993: but it can be confusing
melody8h:  similar thoughts before...?
melody8h:  what do u mean?
KaTz993: well, not exactly the same, 
melody8h:  ??
KaTz993: i'll admit, i have thought about you in a way that i couldn't really put my finger on before i had talked to dana, but then i realized it's just because i am so close with you and have known you for such a long time. i mean, it's like i've said, i do feel like i can tell you anything. ...even this. so it had occured to me that it happens
KaTz993: ...and if you don't totally freak out at me for that, well thats a relief
melody8h:  haha of course i wont freak out
KaTz993: well don't know, you're my best friend, it might be weird for me to say that
melody8h:  the line between best friend and more than that is easy to cross
melody8h:  or think about crossing
melody8h:  what is the one huge difference between best friend and partner??  SEX!!!
melody8h:  it all brings us back to that one pestering theme
KaTz993: haha i knew it tied in somehow
KaTz993: but yeah, so it got me mixed up
melody8h:  but ur not mixed up now?
melody8h:  or are you
KaTz993: not really, it just reminded me of what you would say about tammy
KaTz993: because i have these thoughts about you and it says to me ""i'm not ironclad straight"" but i also don't feel like i prefer to look for partners of the same sex. the whole thing is just because i know you in particular
KaTz993: so that's what i was getting at
melody8h:  i think if tammy and i broke up i would have to do some serious thinking if i were planning on ""looking for someone""
KaTz993: yeah thats what i mean, the whole particular person thing
melody8h:  yea...and with ryan it was a friend thing for you too
melody8h:  i feel like i could never date without being friends with the person first... but once u get older u dont tend to make good friends as often
melody8h:  i haven't made ANY new real friends since i left college
melody8h:  i made plenty of ppl im friendly with but nobody i would really trust and consider my true friend
KaTz993: oh wow
KaTz993: :(
melody8h:  maybe its bc i do have enough friends, or because i have tammy
melody8h:  maybe if i didnt have tammy id make more, or if i didnt have you and jenni and janice id make more... who knows
melody8h:  maybe im satisfied... even though many times i do wish i had more friends... maybe thats just a deeper desire for something else
KaTz993: who knows
melody8h:  yea
KaTz993: as long as you feel happy
KaTz993: thats what matters
melody8h:  usually i do... sometimes i feel bored
melody8h:  sometimes i just wanna have more friends so i can get different perspectives on different things
KaTz993: thats a good reason
melody8h:  like, basically you and tammy are my only religious perspectives as far as friends go
melody8h:  none of my other friends can have a decent conversation on morality and stuff
melody8h:  well, religioius morality
melody8h:  janice usually just agrees with everything liberal, and she isn't christian so i cant pour over those details with her
melody8h:  jenni sometimes has great convos but shes not only non-religious, shes religious-phobic
KaTz993: oh
melody8h:  so basically, sometimes i would like friends who i can talk religion with
melody8h:  and many times id really like some gay friends to talk to
melody8h:  i mean, janice may be gay, but shes not in a relationship so its almost like shes not
melody8h:  and shes had sex with a guy
melody8h:  so whatever
melody8h:  i mean i have too, but that was be4 i was gay
melody8h:  and she didnt even have sex with someone she was going out with
melody8h:  she just had sex for the fun of it
KaTz993: on that note, i just hope you know i haven't ever intended on bringing up your date-life pre tammy because i discount her or anything like that
melody8h:  of course not
KaTz993: its only ever because you're the only one i've talked to about this kind of stuff and you can tell me about hetereosexual sexual matters
KaTz993: its like you said before, it's what i need you for
melody8h:  im sure holly would LOVE to tell u
KaTz993: lol
KaTz993: yeah but it wouldn't be anywhere nearly in the same galaxy of the same thing as you
melody8h:  which by the way, dont ever mention to holly my sex life please, especially the one with chris
melody8h:  im sure she knows i had sex with him, but iv never discussed it with her because i dont like what she'll say about it, and i dont ever want to
KaTz993: of course. shw would probably just hit me if i did
KaTz993: you think she'll judge you?
melody8h:  haha, no... i know what she thinks of sex
KaTz993: i was going to say
KaTz993: i don't think she could judge
KaTz993: lol
melody8h:  it was important to me when it happened, and holly doesnt think its important, so y should she know
KaTz993: makes sense
KaTz993: im not going to tell her, i was just curious. i mean her opinion sex doesn't really matter to me
KaTz993: not the way yours does
KaTz993: honestly it makes me sad i don't have the kind of relationship with her that i do with you
melody8h:  im probably one of the people who thinks its most important that doesnt completely agree with waiting till mairrage
KaTz993: we could have, but she sped away from me in the total opposite direction. i just can't relate nearly as well anymore
melody8h:  neither can i
melody8h:  anyway
melody8h:  heres my biggest scruple with waiting till mairrage (i have many scruples... i also have many things about waiting for mairrage that i agree with)
melody8h:  my biggest scruple is.... just because you're not married doesn't mean you don't know that person is forever, and just because you're married doesn't mean you do know
KaTz993: thats true
KaTz993: and you'd think i wouldn't be so ironclad about it with my parents' marriage broken apart
melody8h:  tell me, does it have anything to do with you being adopted...?
melody8h:  like... your genetic parents should not have had sex cuz they weren't married?
KaTz993: i never really thought about that too much
KaTz993: i mean i guess not
KaTz993: cause if they didn't i wouldn't exist
melody8h:  oh... eh, it was something i just thought of
melody8h:  yea, i was thinking that too
melody8h:  ...
KaTz993: i mean, my genetic parents were the farthest thing from marriage and love
KaTz993: i really was an accident
melody8h:  you cant be sure there wasn't love
KaTz993: ok you got me there
KaTz993: but anyway, maybe i'm just still caught up in a kind of ideal fairytale. 
KaTz993: i want
KaTz993: to not live in the future what i'm living now
KaTz993: its the most heartbreaking thing you can imagine
melody8h:  another scruple of mine: people who wait tend to think that sex is some magical act that will have this super meaning... something they can't possibly imagine, something soooo incredible...etc etc... and while that is somewhat an accurate description of sex, the more you think its going to be that way, the less it is... its like getting your hopes up too high sort of
KaTz993: i guess
KaTz993: i can't agree or disagree
KaTz993: thats a p.o.v you can only have after the fact
melody8h:  yea... well its just like i said before... there are emotions in sex, but they are only the emotions you bring to sex, not emotions that are inherent in the act.... and i think many people who wait think there will be these magical emotions that emerge from the act itself
melody8h:  you mentioned the word fairytale and it made me think of that
KaTz993: in reality i know now that marriage doesn't mean you'll love the person forever
KaTz993: but i would still like to think that
KaTz993: it's a little bit of constance i can rely on
KaTz993: that i can have confidence in the idea of getting married to someone i love
melody8h:  its up to the individuals, not the title of mairrage, to stay together... putting the title: husband and wife, on two people won't make them more likely to stay together, but if you want that title it means you are going to try, and if you are determined you can
KaTz993: yea
melody8h:  i believe that any married couple has the ability to stay together if they try hard enough
melody8h:  however, in this society where people get what they want at their fingertips trying is not something people know how to do
KaTz993: its part of the reason ryan means so much to me. i don't have to stay together with him. but i want to. for as long as i can. it lights a spark for me
KaTz993: like it's a serious thing for me. i want our relationship to work, and i would work to keep it 
melody8h:  as far as the stuff youve told me about him, i like him, he seems great for you... theres one thing im afraid of, that if you break up, he seems like the type to go a little crazy
KaTz993: maybe
KaTz993: i definitely don't make jokes about breaking up
KaTz993: but in turn, i take that as a sign of his affection. i mean he really cares about me and can't believe he was lucky enough to get my affection in return
KaTz993: that is, when he said he didn't want to lose me
KaTz993: and all that
melody8h:  well thats's what i mean... its dangerous waters to tread in... going out with someone who thinks they dont deserve you
melody8h:  hopefully you can work that out though
melody8h:  i think hes good for you in many ways
KaTz993: are you saying this partially in tie to chris?
melody8h:  umm... well it did happen with me and chris too, and it has happened to other friends of mine, and my mom
melody8h:  it always seems to turn out badly
melody8h:  its up to the guy to work out
melody8h:  some guys can, some cant
KaTz993: well i mean i'm taking it as a bit of flattery for the moment. i'm realyl not that much better. lol
melody8h:  they need to think they deserve you to have a good relationship
KaTz993: him saying that was like 'wow, you like me that much?'
melody8h:  it is flattery, at first, and thats why so many girls go for it
KaTz993: but i mean him and i have grown a lot even since we first met. 
KaTz993: and he overcame a huge hurdle with his personal space, and his emotional fears
melody8h:  yes, im sure he can get over it
KaTz993: so i'm tending to think he'll keep changing as time goes on
melody8h:  yea, and theres no point about worrying about it
melody8h:  im not even trying to give advice or anything
KaTz993: nope lol
melody8h:  but...if you do feel like you want out of the relationship, ull probably need to talk to me
melody8h:  bc it is HARD to break up with someone like that
melody8h:  they make you feel SOOO guilty
melody8h:  after i broke up with chris he kept telling me about how he does a lot of pot
melody8h:  trying to imply that i drove him to it
KaTz993: well i'm already in. hopefully we're both outrageously wrong, but if not, well i'm already in it
melody8h:  he told me about cutting himself and everything
melody8h:  yea, i know... im not trying to tell you to get out
melody8h:  im just saying if you ever DO, talk to me about it
KaTz993: i know
melody8h:  bc it sucks
melody8h:  of course thats a big IF
KaTz993: i know i know ;)
melody8h:  another thing you have to take into account
melody8h:  is
melody8h:  think of how much you've changed since you were 18
melody8h:  a HUGE deal right?
KaTz993: yes
melody8h:  he will change that much in the next few years
melody8h:  everyone in college does
melody8h:  it might make him better for you
melody8h:  it might make him worse for you
melody8h:  you'll just have to see
melody8h:  all i'm saying is, don't start planning the wedding... he will be a different person in a few years and you have to make sure you love that person as much as the person he is now
KaTz993: well for the moment, i know what you say about not getting too insane with ties, but i'm with him living like it's going to keep going on
melody8h:  yea
melody8h:  thats all you can do
melody8h:  you cant go out with someone expecting it not to last
melody8h:  what would be the point
melody8h:  you have to think it has the potential to last, and want it to
melody8h:  if you dont want it to you shouldnt be going out
KaTz993: of course, there are those people who say its crazy not to date other people. that even if it does work fine, no one should just be with the same person forever ...that we need experience
KaTz993: but ideally, i'm seeing him now for who he is, and i would stay with him over the ability to 'surf for dates'
melody8h:  and anyone that you were with that you would trade for dates isnt worth it
KaTz993: like those ""i feel like we should see other people so we can' types of people
KaTz993: thats so dumb to me
KaTz993: why mess with a good thing
melody8h:  i can see the lure of the dating scene
melody8h:  its kind of exciting meeting new people
melody8h:  in a nervous sort of way
melody8h:  at some points i thought, oh that would be fun
melody8h:  even now, the thought of it is fun
melody8h:  but fun, who needs fun.... i can get fun many other ways
melody8h:  i cant get true love any other way than being with one person
KaTz993: tru tru
melody8h:  anyway, my eyes are bugging out
melody8h:  i need to get off the comp
melody8h:  and do something
KaTz993: lol
melody8h:  iv been online for hours!
KaTz993: so much for not being on all day
melody8h:  haha
melody8h:  i know, its after 5
KaTz993: we wrecked that
melody8h:  that counts as all day
melody8h:  but good convo
melody8h:  worth it
KaTz993: yes totally
melody8h:  still didnt get to the core of sex and virginity, but we revealed some interesting insights
KaTz993: hehe
melody8h:  alright, ttyl
KaTz993: bye
KaTz993: that was major fun
melody8h:  ciao!
melody8h:  see ya soon hopefully
KaTz993: yep

"event","ahh, all clean from the beach. i got back from the wilsons' at 9.
here's how the rest of the day went:

+ Heather and Tammy got back to the apartment later than 11, which i found out was because Richie showed up at 10:50 instead of 10. what a surprise. and i've only heard about him a couple of times. lol

+ We left for the beach and happened to see Heather's friends there too. We all laid out on the sand for a while, ate vegetable chips,(what are these weird chips with purple lines on them?) Tammy hung back and the rest of us went walking down the beach for a bit. Thank goodness for bad sight. at least when you have to walk through the nude beach. ahhh. noooo. One of heather's friends was so weird. she kept looking all the way down the beach. and she just said ""hey, there's stuff there, I have to look."" ...um okay. you do that. Came back, lazed for a bit more, then heather's friends left, since they had been there for a while already. Heather, Tammy and I hung around for a while more. I fell asleep very very briefly on the sand. kept a shirt over my face. lol heather looked pretty funny with Tammy's bucket hat over her face. lol 

+ We got hungry eventually and left around 3:30 to go to her parents' house. It was funny at first because there were cars in the driveway, but all the doors were locked. so heather called inside the house and when her mom answered and opened the door for us, she was soaking wet in a towel since she had JUST gotten out of the shower. haha. She's been in the house alone all week, so when heather asked if mrs. wilson was making dinner, she said no, we had to cook for ourselves. lol she went out to shop and stop to get food for us, but Tammy cooked hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill.

+In the meantime, Tammy had stumbled upon Drumline on TBS. Neither her nor heather had seen it before, so we watched. the food was good. one hot dog accidentally got super super burnt. so bad you couldn't see anything but black. x.x needless to say i didn't eat that one. lol 

+After eating heather and I suddenly got really tired. we almost fell asleep on the couch. mrs. wilson had picked up holly from the train station, so I got to see her too. 

+I had quite a laugh when holly went to make a sandwich with hardboiled eggs and then realized the egg slicer (aka the ""chomp chomp"") was still in the dishwasher. haha. she was like ""what am I supposed to do with this egg without the chomp-chomp? heather: ""well you could spent 15 minutes carefully cutting it with a knife to be the same way."" holly: ""you know it won't be the same."" :(  haha. funny.

+AFter some time had gone by we all felt in the mood for ice cream. we would have gone right away, but somehow we got sidetracked and before you know it, we're grabbing holly's WI yearbook to look up Mark Cragg's last name because heather and I couldn't remember it last night and it was bugging her once we started talking about it again. that turned into tons of reminiscing, staring at people's pictures, and heather pointing at every person she somehow managed to remember from our class year. (which wasn't many) holly pointed at like every person she remembered hating. lol it was fun at first since i remembered a lot of them, but then not. and poor tammy was totally bored, not knowing anyone. 

+We finally broke out of that and went to get the ice cream. the minute we get there, holly says she's gonna order a root beer float and I say ""oh yeahm coyle's has really good RB floats. ""darn, that's where we should have gone! oh well."" lol 

+get back to the house, eating ice cream, and what do you know. we start going on and on about whether or not heather owned the white dress holly wore when we came with me to junior prom. her and holly kept going back and forth about three different dresses: two different white ones and a pink one. and heather insisted holly didn't know what she was talking about. so i told her i'm just gonna have to pull out the picture. lol so ridiculous. don't know why we get into such silly arguments, but that's when they're the best. hehe 

+holly left to pick up her dad from the airport, coming back from a vegas business trip. tammy, me and heather played Yahtzee, and the most ""exciting"" thing about that was when heather rolled the dice, said ""fives"" and magically 4 of them were all fives. she delayed dropping one dye by accident, and she said ""please be a five too."" and it was. she made this really weird face when the three of us were shocked. :O what are the chances. it was a fluke. lol 

they brought me home and said I have to hang out sooner than a month from now since it took me forever to see them since school ended. :P today was great. just plain fun. and yes, I hope it doesn't take a month to see them again."

"event","i want to rewind to may. give it back. my summer has been so awesome, I want to re-live it. :P even in the last week, it's sad thinking about things coming to an end, but only because I'm enjoying stuff so much. Trying to spend time with as many people as I can, just having fun. It's seems like I've been spreading time thinner and thinner making plans! Tuesday/Wednesday I was with Heather and Tammy at their apartment, and we went to an open mic night at cool beanz. Mostly emo high school kids, but a good time with some decent coffee. Their place is really cool, and I had an entire day to catch up with Heath. Today I accidentally slept a bit later than I had planned; mostly because I was so tired from the day before. This morning involved me doing lots of packing, and sorting. So my livingroom wasn't the neatest thing ever. clothes and stuff everywhere ya know? lol. My dad was here kinda helping out. Him and Justin were sorta planning to visit my grandfather today. He had surgery the other day, so they want to know how he's doing. I'm supposed to see him tomorrow, and I'm excited to see him doing well. Barbara and I spent the rest of the day together just hanging out. The best thing was Milk and Sugar for lunch. The service all of a sudden kinda seems a little on the dumb side there, since the waiter/waitresses seemed to keep forgetting barbara and I were even at a table. But we weren't in any rush, so it was cool to just sit and talk. And even better, I had another gift card to burn, so it was 'free.' :) It was nice to talk for a while. Things have been crazy with me lately, so having someone to talk to who can kinda relate is always good. Afterward We browsed target, where some slimy product exploded on my hand in the dollar section, and Barnes and Noble, where we found magnetic poetry! I was sad for a moment when she took me home, but then I remembered the block party in like two days, so yay for that."

"event","let me briefly comment on the storm last night:

AHHHHHHH

the end
(just kidding)

it was pretty intense. i'm so glad i have a laptop that isn't connected to any outlets. so I was online last night, but had no fear of my computer suddenly turning off for good. prior to the insane storm (which I am glad we had because my backyard had huge yellowing patches after just one day of heat!)I decided to work out at home instead of going to the gym. I opened up this boot camp workout thing I had bought at borders a while back, and did the 'basic training' workout. it was an hour. a very painful hour. lol there were so many exercises for your arms and shoulders. I thought they were going to snap off. but heck, i've been past surgery for a long while now, and i fiured Ihave to start getting my arms back in motion so I'm prepped for the violin again. so today I'm a bit sore, but that's a good thing ;) 

p.s about the BIG black ants. I have them too! doesn't sound like I have them as bad as liz, but still! they are so gross. you just turn around and there they are right in front of your face, and crawling on everything. i trapped one in a glass that i found in my room and it's so big i could hear it walking around. x.x 

p.p.s yay new icon (yes, I know I havent' changed in forever) love to stitch :)"

"event","i suck at journaling lately. i've just been unmotivated to do it lately since 1)my hand written journal looks like a 5 year old wrote it. and 2) typing out long entries on LJ with just my left hand takes forever and i have homework i need to conserve that energy for. lol anyway

so after that horrible rant i gave about heather's recital the other day, i tried calling her yesterday, she wouldn't answer, and then she IM'ed me asking about my sudden withdrawl the re-RSVP to come. I explained the situation and of course, my dad was totally right. -she was completely understanding and afterward i felt like a huge weight had been taken off my back. i had felt so bad about midding, and now i'm okay. 

Also yesterday, I ran to the mall since I didn't have tons of class, and I picked up cards for Sean, Heather and Amanda. Who knew the small upstairs hallmark would have a better 'congratulations section' than the downstairs large one? so then i had to think of something to get for amanda, and i remembered she loves the OC. of course there's no way I could afford the tv eps ha ha. but luckily, the show just released a new mix of the show's latest soundtrack music. I might just get that for liz too since her birthday was the 22nd. Then I walked into Best Buy and what do I find? the Final Fantasy Movie is out. best buy and their cheaper price were sold out, so i got it at FYE. And it was funny b/c I saw this guy come in to pick it up and I just randomly mentioned how it stunk B.B was out, and what do I find out, but that he had a Best Buy shirt on under his jacket. lol movie=awesome CGI-ness. yay.

I haven't had much to do today either. Theory has been so much nicer now that we're not doing insane boring analysis and papers anymore. We're doing a week of study in World Music. Music from India is awesome. traditonal and contemporary. Sara laughed when she saw the name 'Saraswati' for one Hindu god. Her best friend's name is Swathi, and she thought it was cool there's a god named after the 2 of them. :P  Not sure what we're doing on Friday, but i'm definitely having more fun now. After covno Sway gave me a tap on the back, and I ended up going with her, Katie and her friend Leslie to Burger King. no, i didn't eat any. ewww. that was a funny car ride. blasting the beach boys is fun.

Things I got done today:

Turned in Course Transfer Form
Registered for science class @ suffolk
Edited Clara Schumann Final Paper
Edited again/handed in final English Paper

I ran into Jenna and Christie while talking to Sway later on, and we walked to the bank. Jenna told this really bad joke, and they invited me out to go dancing on Friday. I told them I couldn't b/c I'm supposed to go see nestor torres on friday. and katie said dr. mrs. h can get the tickets for free! but now that's fuzzy because katie is getting nick to drive her and tiff. x.x i explained how I had kinda given Nick an attitude today for him doing what he usually does, which is be apathetic when i talk to him about our work. and we concluded after everything, that me asking for a ride is going to lead to awkwardness. :( what bad luck. I hope I can somehow go. yes this is long. considering I had the patience to type all this, well i just went with it."

""who can beat the massive snowstorm and get necessities first?""

haha. actually the 'massive snow' i kept hearing about hasn't shown up yet, but like i said I'd be, I was at the grocery store early this morning at 9:00. I mean I'm up anyway, so why not? I managed to remember my discount card this time, so everything wasn't uber expensive. lol when i was on the checkout line, the woman in front of me dropped her gallon of milk and it spilled all over the floor and was steadily crawling toward me, so i moved over a line. if that was me, well, i'm just glad it wasn't. :P

My mom and Justin didn't get to go college hunting in Jersey today because they were afriad of having to drive in the snow on thw way back. that stinks about the school thing, but when i heard how bad the snow hit NJ, I was glad they didn't risk it. 

the house washing machine is broken for the third time, so I put my laundry aside for the morning and did what else? went to the mall! geez, that place has become like a lame fallback for not staying on campus. lol I guess you could call it entertaining exercise. if you walk from one end to the other it's a mile, so considering i do that quite a few times during one trip, hehehe. I'm anxious as to when the Borders will be open. Sometimes I would like to just be around books. if I could read, I'd be buying books every week instead of music. It must be fundraiser month or something at crossgates, because lots of display tables were at different places all day long. i don't mind donating to things every once in a while, but donating once and then being barraged by 4 more people after is kinda overwhelming. i left earlier than usual, mostly because i wasn't really doing anything and I wanted to get back to cook my dinner. annoyingly, I stood outside a downtown albany bus and it drove away when I was waving to the driver to open the door to let me on. x.x so i waited. and while i was waiting, three really tall guys and a punk-ish girl came out and all lit a cigarette. i just turned my head and was thankful they weren't blowing it my way. this one older woman moved down the sidewalk because she was right where the smoke was. so eventually i moved over a steo because it was starting to smell really bad, and i guess the girl saw because she decided to be a bitch and not only move over too, but she turned her head toward me and blew he smoke. >_< wtf. loser. then these ghetto talking guys came out and one guy walked right by me and he reeked of pot. like so much you'd have to have no nose to miss it. ew. and that poor woman from before kept having to walk back and forth because it was the cigarettes on one side, and the potheads on the other. lol It was getting kinda crowded and a bit sketchy, but luckily I heard these two guys from school, greg and randall. we talked while waiting and sat together on the bus. so i felt better having them there. i mean not that i really thought anything actually bad would happen, but doesn't hurt to have company around. mostly we talked about the music teachers and laughed about the weird stuff they do. that took some of the staleness out of my afternoon from seeing no one. i'm excited for tomorrow because it's the faculty recital and my teacher is gonna be playing in it! I love hearing him perform, he's so incredible. it makes getting better really worth it because you can really see what the people you are learning from are capable of."

"event","well based on the subject you can see where this is leading already. hehehe
I had was felt like a glorius day today. Laziness in the morning of course, my dad came home during his break to have lunch with me. we watched some of Grease, (which has been on VH1 like a million times since yesterday) and a tad of unsolved mysteries. ...but i will never watch robert stack alone. ...not even during the day time. lol Took forever to decide what to wear for this afternoon. went on a mini cleaning spree to keep my hands busy. i felt sorta hyper today. near the last minute i realized justin was about to come home so i decided to do him a favor and grilled a hanburger and some fishsticks for him to eat when he got home since we had to run out to ASJ as soon as my dad got back ar 3:30. the funny thing is it turned out the reunion thing started at 3 at really only went til 4:30, not 5. lol oh and of course the fab # is sitting out on the bench all in a row and my dad is like 'oh look, it's the whole gang all in a row. lol went inside, signed in and wore my happy name tag. they people at the table handed me a raffle ticket then like 5 minutes later they did the thing and i ended up winning an alumnae polo shirt with the school logo on it lol. nice price :P and of course typical ASJ, they took pictures and i was like 'okay...smiling at the last minute, probably look like a doofus.....so those pics will be in the next alumnae newsletter. n.n;; saw little to none of faculty. except mr. marinelli; who i nicknamed the name tag man because he was wearing like everyone's who had walked in. a few 03'ers were in there and niki and heather and amanda kesner. what was amusing about those few minutes:

1) heather zimmerly is blonde and mr. marinelli said she looked european lol
2) mr. marinelli: 'kira, you're a sophomore, right?' erin: 'hey! we're all sophomores here!'
3) Niki and Amanda were both saying how they were so suprised we all still were such good friends. well i say thank god. i mean it stinks most of the other cliques fell apart. but not us! oh yeah!

other than that we chilled on senior stairs, played hangman while laughing because no one knewhow to draw an apersan sign the right way and ashley thought it was treble clef. :P running like a wimp from kaemara. hehe. and we visited sister nora's grave and each of use said somethings. it was like having a remeniscent conversation. well have to go back and put flowers on the grave. oh! and when i was going home just as my mom and i were saying we were going to call the LI Catholic to see about putting s. nora's name in the obituaries, we came home to find a nice entry written about her. and i never could have written it. there were a lot of places she taught and things she did that none of use knew about. so all i can say is it's about time. 

Ate at Frudat's after leaving and ironically other ASJ people came in right after we got there too. Friday's 3 for 12.99 deal ricks out loud. especially between 5 people when you can sneak into your neighbor's food. lol unfortunately after that great time my mom told me in the car that my dad called and my granfather is sick and they think he has the flu so he's at the hospital right now to see if he needs to stay overnight. i may have to got to my aunt's tomorrow and keep my nana company. :( i don't mind that, but still i hope everything works out so that my grandpa won't have to stay overnight. that'll mean things aren't well. and i hope they will be."

"event","so today wasn't packed to the brim with classes....no ear training since it was cacelled yesterday, no keyboard because of the All-state NYSSMA Conference. so I had time to do stuff like practice my accompaniment project. ...which is actually not coming out too badly after reflecting on my hour of work on it. I took the recording of hehotarkenberg playing through it (hehe) and forced myself to move from chord to chord at the tempo that heather played. it wasn't perfect, but i can always slow it down with kaitlin and sara if i want to, and it's good to think that if after some intense tries my playing sounds good at faster speeds and that it will most likely only improve if i'm able to think it through and take my time. I checked the score on my benchmarks today and 130/130. oh yeah! i'm in great shape. I went to lunch with Greg and Kaitlin at Subway. We were talking about all the stupid quirks of the various cliques that are in the music program. it's funny when you realize how much weirdness goes on in that place. the music majors make up their own miniature high school or something. lol

I played the Mozart Alleluia in french horn class today. I have to play again for Patrice next week. But at least i stepped it up and tried to play some today. Like is typical of me, I looked less practiced than I actually was when I took a deep breathe and was all ready to play through the music as best I could and then no matter what I did the first 2 notes were wrong multiple times! I was getting so irritated because it made me look bad. but then Patrice and I both realized 'hello?' i wasn't starting on third space C, so that's what threw the whole thing off, even in the beginning. lol I played my F chromatic scale too. The first time I did that I made it through pretty well, but not wonderful. then Paul played it and I got a minute to think things thrugh and I played it a second time a little slower and concentrated on what note I was playing and it came out 4837598734259834 times better and really smoothly. Patrice thought it really good. She says I'm not doing badly, only those people who never hand stuff in and that still really haven't played anything much on french horn OR trumpet for her. ...so i guess that makes sense. 

on a side note, my mom talked to an admissions counselour at C.W Post and he told her the only thing holding my application back from being evaluated is the lack of transcripts. but i sent them out, so they should get there soon. The awesome thing is though that if my GPA is 3.5 or higher, I automatically get an 11,000 dollar transfer scholarship, which would cover the extra that Post charges for tuition which CSR doesn't. which is of course, great. :D Just finished putting together my notebook for percussion class. have to study the ensemble piece I'm conducting in class on monday. work work work, it never ends. but i suppose things aren't that bad once you get organized. i should try not to stress so much. heh n.n;;"

"event","Wow I didn't get to my computer the entire weekend? How'd that happen? Eh who cares. ...I was too busy having a incredible time. 

<lj-cut text=""family weekend 05'"">So my mom found a different hotel to stay in this time, and it was much more basic than the last one, but hey  I would live there. It was this really nice big room, a large bed and a couch with a fold out bed, so there was enough room for me my mom and justin. unfortuantely my dad couldn't stay overnight :( 

the room itself had lots of space, nice large bathroom, and the best part? A kitchen area! dishwasher, toaster, coffee pot, and full oven. so the surprise my mom had for us was that she had semi-prepared a brisket before she came up here. she brought a slow cooker and we had brisket and good semolina bread from stuyvesabt plaza for dinner on friday. mmmmmmm so good i can't describe it. basically after convo i packed stuff, we went over to stuyvesant, walked around and stopped in a couple of places. bountiful bread, :D coconuts (where my mom managed to find yet ANOTHER version of pachelbel's canon to buy lol) Stopped in Lindt and said hello to Tarra. Got some truffles. hehe. Last thing was a good bottle of burgundy my mom found in the nice little wine shop that went so well with the meat we had that night. hehe the mall next. because there was a third gift card that wasn't spent the last time they were here and there was splurging of money. lol 

Yesterday. I was up super early. partially because that's just me, and partially because well, I don't sleep long in hotels. but i guess it was good. it got us going nice and quick. The hotel had this nice continental breakfast. after eating and getting moving, my dad was already minutes from the campus, so we rushed over and hung around here til the carnival started up. Justin and I stood on a long line and got a black and white caricature done. He complained when he saw the picture because he said the artist drew me taller than him. the artist did our faces on marionette type bodies. it was pretty funny. plus justin said 'hey he drew me smiling. ...i wasn't smiling.' typical tennage brother. :P I also got a chair massage. that felt so good. my mom got one too. my dad put in for a raffle for me that he swears they wer egoing to call me about. i have a feeling I didn't win lol. While justin and i were on line, my mom waited on another line and got my name done in colorful chinese design calligrpahy. the guy was amazing. he would do these really good and intricate designed for letters. in a matter of seconds.

we all left after that for lunch. the cool thing was that st. rose partnered up with a bunch of different restaurants this weekened that if you show your st. rose ID, you get 15 or 20% off at certain places. we stopped at the ground round, but it turned out at the paprticular place they also wanted you to show a coupon or something, so i couldn't get the discount. u.u;; oh well. after that we drove around trying to find this apple festival. we thought it was going to be apple picking and stuff. turned out to be a giant craft fair with games and a random person running around in a smily apple costume. lol basically we ran around the entire thing faster than i wanted to, but we wanted to see as much as possible before my dad had to leave. i found another unique christmas gift for a certain someone, and i also got to try some good food like a slice of a honey caramel covered apple, real roasted peanuts, and a piece of a fudge covered banana. more mmm. oh! and get this. after like 18+ years of searching, I finally found something with my name on it! this one lady at the craft fair had small metall hair clips with names and little designs on themm. my name was there!! it's a miracle! haha. i'm wearing them, jut because i can. who cares if i'm a bit old for them. what is old anyway? We never actually picked any apples for real, but I did get some good organic apples and a couple of mini pumpkins to have in my room. :) Stopped back at school and dropped my dad off. i was sad he had to l eave, but next weekend is the holiday so it's cool. 

Hannaford was after that. Long grocery trip. like 95% of what my mom bought was for me to stock up during the next 2 and 1/2 months. I have sooooo much food now. but its awesome. i love having a full refridgerator. espcially since it's full of homecooked food. we also got ingredients to make macaroni last night. had that with more of the semolina bread and made banasplits for dessert. i love cooking. it made the whole experience seem more personal. early to bed and early to rise again. this morning was pretty much packing up stuff, and surfing the walmart in crossgates commons. found a humidifier for cheap so i don't die of sore throats everyday the next 3 months. x.x put away all the food i had packed at the hotel last night and bought in hannaford. lunch at Friday's is always awesome. and to cap it all off. justin was like 'how far is coldstone from here?' lol my dad called while we were in there and told me that my aunt is finally having my new cousin baptized. but it stinks a bit because its exctly the weekend after this one. :( bad timing. but i'm sure it'll be a great and really spcial day I'll hear plenty about. Hopefully Justin and my mom will get home in a decent amount of time. It's still the middle of th day, and i have enough time time to get ome work done. luckily its nothing majorly complicated. just some theory. now i have to make sure i don't get distracted. ;)</lj-cut>

my room is stocked with new food, warm clothes, and more shelving (now my phone and stereo are no longer among a mass of wires on my floor all random and stuff. lol) cold weather, bring it on!"

"event","...speaking of memories from last year, does anyne remember this? (borrowed from connie)

There was a woman who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and had been given three months to live. So as she was getting her things ""in order,"" she contacted her pastor and had him come to her house to discuss certain aspects of her final wishes. She told him which songs she wanted sung at the service, what scriptures she would like read, and what outfit she wanted to be buried in. The woman also requested to be buried with her favorite Bible. Everything was in order and the pastor was preparing to leave when the woman suddenly remembered something very important to her. 
""There's one more thing,"" she said excitedly. 
""What's that?"" the pastor replied. 
""This is very important,"" the woman continued. ""I want to be buried with a fork in my right hand."" 
The pastor stood looking at the woman, not knowing quite what to say. 
""That surprises you, doesn't it?"" the woman asked. 
""Well, to be honest, I'm puzzled by the request,"" said the pastor. 
The woman explained. ""In all my years of attending church socials and potluck dinners, I always remember that when the dishes of the main course were being cleared, someone would inevitably lean over and say, 'Keep your fork.' It was my favorite part because I knew that something better was coming...like velvety chocolate cake or deep-dish apple pie. 
""Something wonderful, and with substance! So, I just want people to see me there in that casket with a fork in my hand and I want them to wonder 'What's with the fork?' Then I want you to tell them, 'Keep your fork... the best is yet to come.'"" 
The pastor's eyes welled up with tears of joy as he hugged the woman good-bye. He knew this would be one of the last times he would see her before her death. But he also knew that the woman had a better grasp of heaven than he did. She KNEW that something better was coming. 
At the funeral people were walking by the woman's casket and they saw the pretty dress she was wearing and her favorite Bible and the fork placed in her right hand. Over and over, the pastor heard the question. ""What's with the fork?"" And over and over again, he just smiled. 
During his sermon, the pastor told the people of the conversation he had with the woman shortly before she died. He also told them about the fork and about what it symbolized to her. The pastor told the people how he could not stop thinking about the fork and told them that they probably would not be able to stop thinking about it either. He was right. 
So the next time you reach down for your fork, let it remind you, oh so gently, that the best is yet to come."

I was supposed to meet with the new supervisor of the academic suppport center about getting reasearch done for my project, and she messed up the whole thing, mistaking free time for time she was loaded with meetings. i was feeling so overloaded I almost blew up at the christine who works in the center. I tried getting lots of piano practice time, and I did by now, but at first they wer emaking me run back and forth, and I was trying so hard to concentrate and get as much music down aspossible that them interuppting me more than once just annoyed the hell out of me like you wouldn't believe. all this music is stressing me out. When I want to practice, you don't want to interuppt me; not like that anyway. x.x 

on a lighter note, I did manage to memorize the music; all those piano lines and such; and they're semi-decent, I just have to work them til they're comfortable. But I guess I can be happy I made 'some' progress. ;P I have to play in rep tomorrow! I'm so nervous! :O

computer dragged on today, but on the bright side, I plan on trying to get to know jocelynn, this girl barbara told me she knew in ASJ in like 6th and up grades. it'll be nice if i can to someone else about ASJ stuff, (other than amy who i like never see anymore) lol"

It's great. so yeha, we're just being all ""squee"" abouy this: even though its not like we've never heard each other's voices before. lol okay, that's all. yes its random, but so is everything in my life."

"event","<P>morning everyone,</P>
<P>what's up? I have a feeling this is going to be one fo the longest four day weeks in the history of the world. Why is that? because I'm coming home Friday! I can't wait. This weekend was awesome, and this next one is going to be even better because I'll be at home in my own house, and my parents won't have to leave in the middle of anything! So, has anyone thought of a place they'd like to have lunch/dinner whatever we're doing? I don't care, I just want to see you guys. Today should go by alright. two classes, and I did a ton of work the past week or so so that I wouldn't be loaded down. Although I do have two test wednesday and one tomorrow. &gt;.&lt; But I studied/practiced for them, so I feel pretty prepared. I love flannel sheets...yes I know that was totally out of nowhere, but it's already starting to get cold around here and the sheets were great the first night. lol Wednesday is going to be hell. well actually, its all music, so it's good, but man will i be busy. I wish I had off like liz today. :-P not fair! Yuck, other reason I hate the cold: (i prefer the cold over the heat, but still,) morning sore throats. I get them sooooo much during the fall anf winter. It's like some kind of annoying post nasal drip or something. ugh I hate it. Now I'm going to be jealous of barbara and say I wish I had a whole cabinet full of tea, because&nbsp; could really use some right about now. haha. I'm hoping to get over to Korean street at some point coming back to school and get a jar of kimchi. yes I'm a freak. don't know if it will happen, but I think I'll at least stop in this one deli I usually go to and get a pack of vegetable rolls. Those are awesome. *sigh* I miss everyone! I'm going to treasure the weekend so much you have absolutely no idea. It's nuts. So, anyway, changing subject again, did anyone actually watch the presidential debates? I forgot to. I have a feeling it wouldn't have been very productive, (its just two men pointing fingers at each other and trying to prove who's more macho...woo) but still, it might help a littlee since I am planning to vote. Absentee ballot on my first time! yeah out of state people! lol (changing subject again) I still&nbsp;wish I could go visit ASJ. But I have no time for it :""( and yeah I'll probably go crazy wth curiosity like barbara. *cries* I was thinking about the thing barbara said with the letter day thing...I was just randomy thinking the same thing. Like, ""what day is it today? A day?"" It was this really random first thought that&nbsp; had this morning. I knew we were going to miss the school. Admit you miss it!!! lol *sigh* breakfast soon. </P>"

"event","Well it's later now, what to write about? It was academc day agan today... yuck. Actually I think it depends on what mood I'm in. The fact that all I have to do is make it through class and the conceptual part of class isn't very complicated..that I just have to be responsible and read isn't hard. But sometimes I just don't feel like wasting over an hour to just hear people talk. My one class is group discussions...woo and the other is just lecture,lecture and more lecture...blah. its over though, and I just finished my reading so who cares. Have basic in abut a half hour. which is good. then tomorrow I can get up nice and easy, no class til 12. but ew for keyboard class. I hope the professor doesn't think I haven't practiced. >.< But have my mobility lessons after that, and I'm going to be riding the bus to the mall, so maybe I can convince my teacher to let me walk around a little bit. hehe. Took my first theory quiz this morning. it was just what I thought it'd be. and I think its good I was suprised by the test. Feeling amply prepared for college exams just makes them seem a lot less intimidating. It's the time leading up to the tests that suck. You just want to study and then spill all the stuff you remember out onto the paper so that you feel like you knew what you were doing during all that time. So yeah. I might have maybe thrown 1 or two annoying little mistakes, but i think they were only like 2 pts each out of a bunch of questions, so it wouldn't be the end of the world. Besides, dumb mistakes don't show a lack of effort. lol Nothing special going on right now....i've discovered my roomate is probably going out again this weekend. Not HOME but just not here either. oh well. It just further cements my desire to have a single next year. lol It's official, I have a friend. 1, but I've always been a low-key girl, and I am not about to complain. ^_^ *sigh* nothing especially significant this weekend. studying at some point on sunday with a tutor for my old testament test. ugh, I have to have someone go over a stupid map with me. I hate it when something totally depends on someone else being my eyes. >.> but at least having tutor help will force me to set aside a specific time to do it, and its not during the week, so I do some work and then I still have plenty of time to chill out, knowing I got the priority things done. *yawn* kinda tired. I didn't want to get out of bed this morning. but I can't wait for the weekend. stupid laundry, braille lesson, but I'll probably try and work out again, maybe jump in the pool. we'll see. okay, now I""m just rambling my not finished thoughts. Sorry about that. 9 days!!!!"

 first off, what's with the update page? it took me 5 minutes to get to where i recognized the screenreaders narration..oh well. Fast wednesday, despite the fact that I'm going back and forth betwen the music building like a million times. Well I do love full music days best, so I guess it evens out. in The building did open back up today, but my dictation test got pushed back til monday, adn we did some more practice in class, so that was good. And in the hour between ear training and my lesson at 11, I managed to get MORE reading done, doing the next entry in my Bible log journal...so now I'm done with my work through next week in my two liberal classes because they are soo behind with the reading assingments. But who cares? This way I can enjoy the week before my parents come up without working insanely. *coughs* only bad thing is I think I'm getting a cold. Having some noodle soup right now for dinner. Yes it's late. Talked to my parents earlier, and I can't wait for them to come...we're going to have the whole day together. And it'll be really good because they can meet Jesse's parents and vice versa. So maybe they'll want to split rides for the holiday. I don't want to make them go to much out o ftheir way though. Jesse told me they have to rent a car when they want to drive up here just because its such a long distance and their car might not survive numerous drives back and forth, so yeah, it's just a thought. Anyway, so tomorrow shouldn't be too bad, since I again won't have to do massive note taking...I'm going to read in the morning before theory, have the quiz. >.> it'll be easy...then I just have to get through the two lecture classes..yuck. but at least I can take it easy for a while. Not sure what I'm going to do this weekend, aside from the usual braille and preparing for my test on the Torah, I'm not planning to go the mall, so I might just work out some and/or go swimming. don't know. hey but it's still the weekend, so yea for that. be back tomorrow, nite all"

   wednesday is over...i just got in about 30 minutes ago. Eating my dinner. I nuked a soup in the microwave, and wasn't assigned any new reading today. So I'm making a point to just rest tonight. Just talking to people, mom, dad, kelly, sheila...just getting a chance to say ""hi"" to people. Today is Kelly's birthday too. Tomorrow I have only my three classes. But I'm going to be going on mobility lessons after class, so unlike last week, I won't be rushing back here to my room to insanely attack my reading assignments. That's another thing I'm trying to improve on this weekend. Just gonna do a little review reading tonight, nothing big, and I won't concern myself with IMMEDIATELY trying to do my work. so today I was pretty okay. got sorta upset while I was inbetween classes, but I'm attempting graadually to keep myself on track during the day so I freak out less and less. It's gross out, once again I got rained upon while walking back from chamber orchestra class. And it's a long enough distance to get pretty soaked. But luckily I got to test out my new umbrella so I didn't get too wet. Anyway, trying to unwind, and talking on the cell while I'm writing, so sorry if this entry is a bit ""distracted."" Barbara-there's plenty to do in boston and the surrounding area. I have friends in the nearby towns, ask me if you're bored. ^_^ *sigh* almost friday."

"event","this is just an entry to make an entry. one to vent and express my feelings. but first...barbara--i'm glad you made it to boston alright. so yeah, rolling with that...i was very homesick today. this week has been quite difficult. We're all far away from each other. and like, we can call one another and talk, but its not the same as in h.s cuz on a random tuesday night when we might call each other afer finishing hw, we wouldn't be able to hang ouot right at that second, but we could realistically say something like ""want to hang out this aturday?"" we can't do that, and like tlaking on the phone to you guys is relieving and painful at the same time...just because of that. and i'm glad to know i'm not the only one feeling homesick faster than in the first 3 months of school thank you barbara; i am normal! but i still miss home like crazy. I don't quite get it myself...i mean i missed home every once in a while when i was in Mass. (You guys all saw my daily posts.) and i had one extra emtional night. but i was okay the next morning. but here, its like i;ll be okay one second and he next second anything will jog some memory of home, school, or whatever and I'll want to go home. And I went to the movies last night, had a good time, and for a while drowned out eerything, just going out and doing something fun. but then I woke up this morning and thought I was in my room. when i realized I wasn't, I almost broke right then just cuz i had a bit of a shock. It's probably because i had a dream i was home, and then 'boom' i'm not there. okay enough of that. I really want to be able to not have a constant feeling of these moodswings, and i don't suppose this carrying on is helping. let's all pray for each other guys. I miss you all so much. I miss beng connected, and I miss home. bottom line. but i need to just keep trying. and thanks for all the encouragement liz. I'll just have to do a lot of praying and keep my eyes on the goal. ^_^ And just keep in mind about visiting me. you-- and anyone else who is reading this. ^_- October 1/2nd family /friends weekend. :-)"

Because for every minute i go not thinking about it, i follwo up with two more minutes of frantic thinking, trying to make sure i have everything done. ouch my head hurts...and with the added time used to go on mobility lessons and scheduling time to get braille lessons, i'm gonna have to be even more organized!!! *breathes* right now I'm so freakin' up to date I have to chuck my back pack into the bottom of my closet and shut the door for the weekend. otherwise I'm just going to continue down the past to insanity. I know that has been a regulary reoccuring topic in my entries lately, but god, I never realized how much of a frantic thinker i am. once again, let me just bring us all back to perspective by reminding everyone how much of a nicely wrapped birthday present ASJ was. I know we all thought people like Mrs. Wood were soooo annoying to deal with, but man, i miss their flexibility a lot right now. Not that my new professors aren't being just as friendly and understanding so far, but it's just be so incredibly overwhelming. I need major distraction!!! hmm, I'll hook up my TV today, and then tomorrow nght I will watch tons of V to get my mind off of work. I have three days, and ALL OF MY WORK IS DONE. I just have to keep reminding myself of that. haha, I already sound insane. please people, feel free to badger me and cause massive distraction at anytime... Maybe I'll knit, or something....don't know yet. kinda wish i was home. u.u"

"event","hi guys,

   i think I finally have a handle on things...day 3. I'm getting a little more organized every day. I have some reading to do tonight for anthropology and old testament...have to pick up those e-text files before string teh class at 4, but other than that, I think I know what my work is gonna look like for the weekend, and I'm getting vetter at keeping track without flipping out at the magnitude of it all. Yes I know I sound crazy. Last Night I locked myself out of my room (apprently you can turn the key one way to unlock thhe door, but if you do it that way and remove the key, it will sill lock beind you even when you open and shut the door again. so i went out to go to the bathroom andn the door shut. when i came back, I was locked out and it wasnt even my fault. So the RA from the 2nd floor came up and let me in, but I got documented and if i get three slips i get charged five dollars. It wasn't THAT big of a deal, but man, I was so stressed out trying to manage all my priorities mentally that the slip was the last straw and i flipped. Not too bad, but I was rambling a little and I wish I hadn't. Therefore I am going to admit I need to reserve time to relax and remember that I can handle college...even if it does look really intimidating at times. The good news is that even though I stayed in over going out bowling last night, I got some of mt accessible work done, that won't be assigned until thursday, si it's one less thing I have to do over the weekened. And my repetoire class doesn't meet daily anymore until the end of the smester, and I don't have to perform it it until junior year, so that takes some pressure off, same thing for convocation class. Both performance, and I don't have to do anything...not that I won't pay attention, but its one less thing to worry about. So yeah, I thin I'm getting slightly better. Just called my private teacher to schedule the time I will be having on campus lessons, and I'm all set to start recording music again. Things are looking in an upward drection today, And tonight Ill just have to come back from chamber orch. at 8:30 and do some reading for tomorrow's classes. And if you guys want my schedule to be posted, comment and let me know. I'll put it up next time I get a chance. (oh and for liz and anyone else without a phone card yet, you can still call my cell after 9, that's when I'm pretty available to talk anyway, considering class all day long. Leave me messages i will make me feel happy! ^_^)"

  I know Liz is mad at me for only announcing my leave on LJ. sorry about that. :-/ I had tried calling a bunc of you a ton of times though and all of you fell off the face of the earth without telling me though; and i miss ASJ. I've said that at different times before and since graduation, but honest to God I miss it so much. We had it so great there, and college is scary to no end. I thought I was all prepped, you know, from going away to boston and having time to practice living away from my parens, doing my own luandry, stuff like that...but the added aspect of keeping on top of homework and continually reviewing these syllabuses scares me. Falling behind is the last thing I want, and I already feel like thats happening because my scanner was being a jerk and won't work, so I couldn't scan in and read my ear training work last night. I'm supposed to find a solution to the problem today, but yes, this is one of those times where I want stuff to be taken care of right away so I don't have to think about it again and again. *breathes* I really have to chill. I have class in an hour. Music comp 1...fun, I hope I don't get homework from that class today...I just want to be able to fix these annoying problem before I have mroe to concern myself with you know? ugh, okay, enough lazing around, I have to back to the student center and try getting my work put into a format my software can read. fun right? I know you all wish you were me. lol ttyl

    what's up? I'm all unpacked and settled in at college. I have a great roomate and our room rocks the world. In all seriousness, Our room does look pretty cool, I'll have to send pictures to some of you random people. Oh and I've already had interesting misadventures, getting a locksmith to help me figure out how to lock my impossible door... running to the crossgates mall and running within it in lless than 35 minutes to look for a bicycle lock to lock m trunk to my bed. (keeping my laptop in there, don't want it stolen.) It's really hot up here, but I think its finally colled a little bit. Noting to do until 5:00, then I have first floor meeting with the RA, and then dinner and a mentalist is suppose to come from 8-9:30, but nothing says I HAVE TO go to that. lol. You just wouldn't believe the clutter that was in this smalll space of a room before...boxes and boxes and boxes. X-/ Can't wait to sleep tonight, I've been up since midnight and the drive was a tad long. oh well. I'll write more when I'm not so overheated, bt just thought you'd all like to know I'm here now, so the cell is the only way to reach me. Actually, scratch that...my dorm number is 1-518-485-3071, If anyone wants to call ""long distance"" and happens to catch me in the room. I know I get a dorm voicemail too, just don't know how to work it quite yet, so bear with me. lol later all.

   So I had a reasonably quiet evening yesterday, was listening to music and making long distance phone calls in my bedroom. I spent a good amount of time talking to Erik...I think him and I might hang out in the city before I go away to school. I miss playing chess with him and Patrick. I miss Shiela too. Heck, I miss all of the YIT guys. Except for maybe Dana. He was a major pain in the neck. Speaking of my summer prison, I think someone there might have gotten caught doing something bad. Not while working, but I have yet to discover whther or not they might have actually been working. I tried calling Micah back last night and gues what? Some guy answers the phone. In a message she left on my cell earlier, she had said that her and Nathan (her boyfriend) had spent the day in Boston. So I assumed it was him right? I mean the static on Micah's phone was pretty bad, so I thought it might have been him. Well turns out it was Carlos instead. Good thing I never actually siad my name over the phone. Carlos can be pretty dense, so I don't know if he recognized my voice. I hope he didn't. But I have yet to find out from Kelly whther or not Micah was working last night. Because if she wasn't, what the heck was Carlos doing answering her phone unless they were out together? And even if they weren't, what was he doing answering her phone anyway? somebody's busted.....I hope Micah isn't cheating. That's just outright ""yuck"" and I will think even less of her if that's the case. And it's to bad because I kinda found something interesting about her since she was the first person my own age I met up at the Caroll Center when I was living with the adults. heh, well I'm hoping I'm wrong. Enough private thoughts of rumors...I'm gonna go knit and whatever, maybe make a chocolate cake. later"

"event","um yeah, kinda bored.

   I don't like it when I get bored anymore. I mean yeah, I didn't like it before, but now it's really annoying. boredom makes me feel ill. but anyway, so I'm home alone, didn't feel like going food shopping because earlier when mom asked me I had a random moment of pain and and irritability. Yesterday was pretty nice. I stayed in bed until late. then I got up and cleaned up the house in my pajamas. Not too long after I was having lunch and Kris called me again. he's been calling me a lot lately. He had nothing to do so he asked if I wanted to get otgether for a little while. He drove over and we ran over to Best Buy to annoy the employees. I actually did pick up a few CD's, (which would later prove to be a mistake) but then after that we drove over to the mall and surfed the stores. I picked up a third CD at FYE and all was good. Then after a few hours and some knitting, Holly came by and we went out to Little Italy for dinner and then to Blockbuster to rent a movie. She came over and we watched The Butterfly Effect. It was good. Kinda scary, Oh and this was after I had a random fit of hysterics in her car on the way out from dinner. See, at Little Italy they serve a basket of bread and zeppoles. Well sugar obviously is a bad thing for me. And I think after a while I was slowly eating the sugar out of the bottom of the basket. Needless to say I got way way hyper. Holly had Ben Folds playing in the car and she said something; I don't remember what, but I just started cracking up and couldn't breathe it was so bad. So she procedes to blast the stereo up to drown out my laughing which then just makes me laugh harder. Eventually I stopped, but not after making myself cry. Sop anyway, I now own a blockbuster card, oh and that another thing. Holly started laughing because you have to have a credit card to apply for embership, so I took my out, and she saw that its an AARP affiliated visa card. lo and behold she starts freaking out about ow I'm not at least 50, so why do I have a ""retired presons"" credit card? And meanwhile the clerk stading behind the desk is just murmuring to hmself....*embarassment* Later on while we were watching the movie, I was eating a nice long tube of Spree, and no, that didn't help either to cease my overly hyper madness. I managed a few Texts with Kelly, just the casual ""hi"" ""what's up"" and ""good night"" but all was fun. Holly left and I crashed in bed. didn't sleep too well. For some reason I'm feeling rather blah again today. don't know why. Can't wait to go to church. I need a break or something. I hate it when I'm all mixed up. church will be good. very good."

   So I had an awesome birthday on thursday! It rocked in all ways possible. Woke up super early, wore lots of purple. hehe And met Heather and Tammy at the train station at like 8:00 in the morning. I was gonna bring my usual messenger bag, and then my mom is like ""Why don't you open Dad's present first?"" So I did and ""whoa"" look a new messenger bag! Jansport is fun,  a blue corduroy bag with much more space....very nice. hmm and my little brother picked me up this cute gold musician's angel. So I stuck that on and carried it around all day. My mom fund a braille birthday card, and all is good. Our trip was loaded with tons of stuff. I'm gonna write about all of it, but actually, I have to go for a bit, but the details will come eventually. Don't mean to keep you in suspense. but direct and to the point, I am now 18!!! yay me."

"event","yay, tomorrow is my birthday. It's supposed to rain though. >:P i'm without a single project to work on today. I finished my fuzzy poster coloring yesterday after working on it completely O.C I got all excited when my mom came home yesterday and had stopped at the craft store, picking up a bag of yarn that had seven rolls in it. Plus the yarn is purple!! The best color in the world. Unfortunately, before I got to enjoy my random (1) knitting high, I realized later that night that I need to learn how to bind the scarf that I completed the other day. heh. So I can't do anything until I wind that up or buy new needles, which I can't do either. Oh irony. Stil really glad i'm home, but feeling a bit blah. Something I also realized yesterday...I got over ASJ very quickly, and didn't even notice until now. I ean we were all sad about leaving, and so on and so forth, but look, I went away, summer is half over and I haven't tried to break into school once since we graduated. I can't quite explain that. I guess the teachers were right when they said that we'd leave and never really fit in the same way again. And I guess they were also right when they said that it was just the right time for us to graduate. Because I went to orientation, and I'm psyched for college. ASJ is past, and suprisngly, even though I'm thinking about it right now, I'm okay with that. I mean, I left and did other things, and I liked them, so now I'm trying to picture myself back at that place and doing the same things fo another year-- it just doesn't feel right. Despite everything we all said, it doesn't feel right, and I need to go ahead with my life. wow okay, I'm getting way to deep for a random (2) journal update. it'z only 10:30 and I have nothing to knit. I would practice for a while to pass the time, but I gave myself a reminder of the shoulder injury I'm currently trying to survive, so no playing for a while. :( okay, gonna go, talk later,"

    First and foremost: it's august 3rd already! And you all know what that means...two days until my birthday and I'm officially an adult! My screenreader program is kinda busted, so I can't really read all your entries, but I can manage to navigate well enough for updates with no knowledge of what's on the screen whatsoever. lol. So I'm psyched. I've been home over a week now. Hopefully if all goes well, my roomate info should come in the mail today. (Considering it was supposed to be here the last week in July, which is over, so yeah.) I want to know if I'm going to have to be in a lousy triple or not. It kinda affects my college dorm shopping, so hurry up already! I'm glad to be home, but yes, Massachusettes was amazing! I miss it. They are way more blind friendly up there than the nasty people are down here. And I find it extremely funny how just like the time right afterr graduation, (when everything was reminding me of ASJ...) Everything and everywhere has suddenly founf its connection to Boston, or Massachusettes. Oh and isn't it amusing how the Republican National Convention is here in NYC, and the Democratic National convention is in Boston? heh. oh well. I'll just be vacationing in Mass. during college breaks; so I suppose it was a good thing I didn't really go to college there. I've been keeping busy by taking walks everyday, knitting. (yeah, I managed to knit a fuzzy scarf, go me!) and doing other seemingly harmless crafts because I'm such an artsy person. lol Crafts are fun. And so is coloring. I have rediscovered those fun duzzy posters that you can color. It's perfect ebcause I can touch them, so I stay inside the lines. hahaha I know to all of you that sounds utterly ridiculous. Anyway, so that's been my life at home lately. And for all of you reading this, Where are you?! I have been trying to call a bunch of you since I've been home and everyone decided to fall off the face of the earth without telling me!!! oh well. I guess maybe I'm a ghost, and you all forgot about me or something? whatever. I'm starved, going to go have lunch, and cingular stinks because they shut my service off even thought my parents paid the bill like two weeks ago. >:("

  I've been home since friday and haven't bothered to update...i know; how irresponsible of me. But seriously, I was so tired the first two days that i just crashed. First of all, it was my second day after my second trip to the emergency room (The first one being on the 18th, that preceing sunday--my talent show anxiety attack) so I went to graduation for YIT that morning at 10, got up early to take a nice shower and just chill. Shiela, one of my dorm buddies played a long game of Skip-bo (card game) with me until 11:30 the night before, and after I was finihsed getting dressed and tapped off my packing, we played a ""quickie"" game that morning. It was fun and yet sad...kinda like ASJ again. lol When we play cards its so fun! I miss them already. I'm telling you, the YIT younger group was way different from staying with those adults for two weeks. Let's see, to sum up, our last tuesday field trip was to the Southwicks Zoo about 15 minutes outside of Hopedale Mass. It's definitely different from the Bronx Zoo, and that being the only one I've ever been to, it was very cool. I got to ride on an elephant. haha, yes I know, I'm never going to grow up. I walked around with Kelly and Kris  (ten)the entire time, that made the experience even better, and more funny because I had an injured right arm, and Kelly had and injured left arm, so we're like the one arm bandits or something. haha. After almost getting lost on the way to the zoo, Kelly managed to give the bus driver directions, and then proceded to give directions back so we'd be at the carroll center faster. It was an awesome rime. Wednesday we had the farewell YIT party over at the tech building, and at the request of the program director, we did our tap rountine again, twice actually--and i didn't fall. lol. The party wasn't too long, a lot of jsut goofing around and dancing. I ate peanut butter chocolate fudge..that I made! yay! Pink lays are pretty! and I had decided that night that I am going back up to boston on my first school vacation...also at someone's request. hehe. I cried a little on Friday morning. After playing cards with Shiela, Kelly showed up, and did my hair. Then she was taking lots of pictures, amd came up to my room with me so I could giver her back the CD's she loaned me...and to make sure I wouldn't fall. lol. Her and I cried because I was leaving, and she told me to wear one of the lays during the graduation. I listened. it was funny, and that night, she called me and we accidentally ended up talking for like almost an hour and a half. haha. I miss newton a lot. I've been apologizing profusely to my parents since I got home because even though I had admitt4ed I knew I was going to learn something before I left, it wasn't as bad staying awy from home as I thought it would be. They said it's okay, but I still feel kinda bad. I guess I was just afraid of being away from them, like I needed to be around. But maybe that's just because I've never known anything else but Long Island. oh well. I have at least one other place I feel comfortable going by myself. And thanks to my last mobility run with Mr. Christopher, I'm much better navigating intersections and handling public transportation. Now if only Long Island would get timely and friendly drivers like Newton has...I know barbara is going to like being up at Boston University; I'm a little jealous. I wish I had given boston more of a chance. oh well again. At least this way, I'll have a different place to try and go to when I'm not at school. Because I mean, if I was already there during the year, I'd have no place to vacation to during breaks, right? lol my logic is so good. tired of typing. I did walk to McDonalds today with Justin, I guess being active for 12+ hours a day gas further motivated me to have some sort of major exercise every day now. And I like it. I guess some changes are good. ^_^"

"event","hi all,
 haven't been on in a few. i know you all missed me. unfortunately i don't really feel like writing my usual long entry. I can barely keep my eyes open. So beyond tired. Reason being? I'm actually only updating (now that I think about it, so that I can remember this at a much later date, while it's still sticking out in my mind.) This weekend was nice. Kelly supervising with Micah all weekend...*sigh* life is good. We all went bowling on saturday, much higher scores. I didn't go sailing, but I managed to finish my weaving club project. (a rope weaved seat cover) I spent the morning working on that while trying to help Kelly with her math work. Micah went sailing. After bowling i was super bored, so i just hung aroudn and whatever. Yesterday was the infinite day. Micah and Kelly still aroudn at 8AM, and I took and early morning shower only to fall asleep on the couch in the rose room and still be asleep when the man taking me to church came to pick me and another kid up. Kelly found me dead on the couch and i was so like ""blah"" but managed to go to mass anyway. It was nice. After I got back, Shiela had this all of a sudden really bad anxiety attack and was too dizzy to get off the couch. We practiced the tap. It was totally awesome. Sheila felt better, and I taught both Kelly and Micah how to play a song on the violin. ^_^ Thanks to her Titanic soundtrack, I was able to work on ""Nearer my God to Thee"" and plan on playing it for Kelly that night during our talent show. Unfortuantely, the prooblem was that (and I should have seen it coming...) The small room we were having it in had the same conditions as ASJ's spring concerts. (for those of you who have expereind the fires of hell; heh) So I managed the tap dance, it was great, everyone loved it. Then I got up to play my violin. Played the piece, but as I was playing, my muscles tightened up again, and I did manage to finish that as well, but right after, I had my head down and was like ""oh my god, oh my god,"" and apprently started staggering backward, Next thing youknow, I'm on the floor with a very sore shoulder, and feeling super sick. I didn't actually ""pass out"" persay, because when I was on the floor, I was able to talk to Kelly, and I was awake. But for some reason I don't remember anything from when I started to the moment I fell. People have gradually been filling in my missing memories. And Kelly tells me that I dropped my violin, but that she ran over and caught it for me, so it was saved. lol Yes, I know you're wondering why she did't catch me, but I thik I fell at such a weird angle it would have been more harm to try and catch me then if I had just fallen. So I was at the hospital until midnihgt. Most of which I also don't remember either, just because I was so freaked out. Think I fell asleep at around 3AM, and went in and out of consciousness the rest of the night, unable to really sleep. Arm is sore, very painful, no hugs today. but I'll be okay once I can finally get back into bed. okay, so my entry wasn't as short as I thought it'd be, but like I said, I do't remember half of last night, so yeah...but I'm alive everybody, so be happy. lol"

"event","short and to the point...that's what i think that subject is. It's not even really raining up here. It's more like really gross mist. And wouldn't you know that I had to have orientation and mobility this morning for 2 straight hours; walking in the really ""ew"" rain? ha ha, that's so typical. Oh well. I'm dry now so everything is okay. Yesterday was tuesday, and we didn't have class. It's supposed to be field trip day, so that helps to make a break during the week. Unfortunately, we didn't go to our scheduled destination. We were supposed to go to George's Island--some island off the coast of boston harbor. But the stupid rain again...it stopped us from going. That's the bad news...Good news, there are a couple of things. 1) we didn't have to end up going to class, and 2) instead, we went to see Spiderman 2. (tobey is a hottie) oh man was it sooooo good. Way better than the last one, and normally I wouldn't say that because sequals typically aren't as good as the original. But geez! Special effects, the acting, suspense, and totally the whole thing--it fit together so well. And I have to say for a L.A movie with such complicated comic book ideas, the producers of Spiderman have been doing a really awesome job of delivery. So I enjoyed my afternoon with Tobey.. *sigh* We still had to go to evening activities, but computer hobbies turned into a major flop (we were trying to record sounds, and transfer them to the computer--and failed miserably) So I just surfed the net instead, which isn't so bad, but I even got tired of that aafter about an hour, and evening activities are two hours long. hmm, Kelly brought back Titanic and we had just gotten to the part where Jack and Rose make it to the top of the boat, it snaps in two, and then blah blah, Jack dies. Yes, I cried. haha, I know some of you are laughing at that, but I couldn't help it. But beleve me, I didn't cry a flood or anything. I held my overall composure... So then after that we staretd watching Vertical Limit. (bill paxton again. yay!) and we didn't get very far-me in particular. I was falling asleep again, so I went up to bed a little sooner than normal. Harry Potter is good. (random statement) I can't wait for this day to come to an end. The days are fun, but kinda long. I want to learn more ASL, and finish working on the tap dancing routine we're doing. That is fun. ^_^ So I'll just have to keep reminding myself of that stuff until later on when it gets here. One of the guys brought a copy of Final Fantasy VII to the dorm to play, and I was all like ""yay happy"" this morning when I saw them playing it. (Yeah Red XIII) I still have to finish that game. and speaking of more random things; you guys wouldn't believe it...I must have been either really bored, or something the other night because I randomly rememebered it was Matt's birthday (my old ""b/f"") so I called him up and said Happy birthday to him. Who knows why I did what I did...I haven't spoken to him in like forever since his thing with Dawn (the new ""g/f"") so whatever. But we did have a nice conversation, just talking about graduation, colleges, what was new, and other stuff. he's gotten a lot more social since I hung out with him; which I think is a really good thing because when we hung out he was super shy and well, seemed really turmoiled inside beause people were always making fun of him. So I guess I'm not sorry I called him, but not really glad either. It was just a neutral action. Still no AP scores...errr they better get here soon, I'm starting to get annoyed. Just tell me what I got so I can stop wondering whether I am going to have to take tons of liberal arts classes over my summers. >.< I don't so much mind that, but geez, just get it over with already! On the other hand though, My mom told me this morning that she got my revised finacial aid package in the mail, and suprisingly got a huge increse in my total yearly scholarship coverage. ^_^ Yay. okay, enough of that. No canoeing tonight I guess. There's still one week left, so hope for sun. Anyway, I g2g now, have class again in about another five minutes. see ya later all."

**started laughing at the random large amount of stupidity in Titanic
**woke up this morning, took a 45 minute nap after my ""breakfast"" (cerealbars...mmm, >.>)

**end

 Well that was my long overdue stream of consciousness update. I like those; straight to the point. and if you're laughing about Titanic...I would havce cried, but 1) we didn't get up to the sinking part yet, and 2) I wouldn't have had the energy to cry even if I wanted to. lol"

"event","I have seen the future...and it is all music classes all the time! ~Me

   Yes, that's right, my schedule for fall semester rocks the casba and all your socks. I have nine music classes! NINE!!!! That is like my life's dream: All music every day. I went to orientation and it also rocked. I did actually meet cool people that want to be my friends. These three girls in particular. Brittany, Casey, and Carley. Brittany I met because like me, she took her math placement exam in a separate room, and is going to have test modifications for the rest of the year. She was really nice; during one of the sessions, I was sitting alone and she came and found me and asked if I wanted to sit with her, and asked if I was going to be taking modified tests this year too. So she was really nice. Casey and Carley I accidently found myself sitting next to during the comedian act that came and visited the school. (Which by the way, he was outrageously funny...lots of sex jokes. :-P) They're well, just cool to talk to, one of them wants to major in special education, which is totally cool because I had tons of special ed teachers my whole life, so I'm all for that. The other is undencided, and says she wants to keep all her options open. But they were nice. We all sat together and ate outside during yesterday's BBQ. And Casey and I sat around listening to the guitarist that was playing during the late night entertainment that we had tuesday night. Ice cream is very good when combined with music. lol So I took the placement exams...The math was a pain because it was all like seq. I material, and I hate algebra. lol But I saw my score sheet right after I finished, and even though the numbers don't really count, I saw that I can choose between like 5 different math courses, up to like math 160. which is really good considering I'm not a math major. The only course I can't take right now is chem 190...which you need a score of 54 (I dk out of how many) but who cares; I hate chem. lol Oh, and that theory test I studied incessantly for? We took it during the last session when we got our schedules. ha ha. It was a joke. (Name these notes...Identify these scales...fill in these time signatures.) It was a ""test"" that took like a minute, and basically, the director told us it's only really geared toward like drummers or something that maybe only learned through tabs or something and that don't know any music fundamentals. *HUGE sigh of relief* But I can't believe I studied so much!!! lol oh well, at least it's over. All I have to wait for now are the evil AP scores. *scary horror music* But other than that...I am taking to liberal arts 1st semester. And it's funny b/c on my course selection sheet I put culture and philosophy pretty close to the bottom on my favoritism scale; like 9 out of 11, and my two given classes are intro the anthropology, and the old testament. so I'm guessing they either ran out of space fast, or those were the only things that fit into my schedule. And the best part: now that I took my math test, I can decide to take my one math class anytime I want before I graduate. I might change and get it over with now, but we'll see. rather not make a fuss the first week. lol But I'm really happy with the decisions I've made, and I feel even better about going to this school now because of the orientation. life is good. really good. There's tons of other stuff, maybe I'll throw some in at other times, but it's entirely too  much for one entry. I will say I have had my little road trip vacation this year. On the way home from Mass. during the fourth, we stopped at that Villiage museum and then on the way back to Mass. we stopped at a place called Howe's caverns, and I got to walk through a dark series of cool tunnels and take an underground boat ride, so the cold caves felt nice in the gross humidity. lol. Again, more details another time, or whatever. oh great...I hope I don't get banned from this lab. Another random adult has found me in here typing and is going to check to see if it's ""okay."" I swear, if they say I can't be ""un-supervised"" and kick me out, I'll be so annoyed. I mean really, I only come in here once a day, write in my journal, check my mail, maybe talk to you guys, I don't spend the entire day here or cut class or anything...just simple stuff. I don't bother anyone! lol enough of that. I'll see you all on the 23rd, and I'm home for good. yay. Then we can all finally hang out and spend time doing--stuff. I don't know. but who cares, I miss you guys, hope all is well. TTYL"

"event","hi all,
   taking a break from the Carroll Center (*cough* prison *cough*)to stay up in albany...orientation tomorrow, then wednesday night, i'm back in Mass. But right now I'm utilizing Holiday Inn's internet connection, so all is right with the world. Last friday I took a walk during my mobility class and got to see Newtonville. (a sub-commmunity of Newton) It kinda is like a rich version of Babylon Village. So on the way up here (left at 8 in the morning) my parents decided on taking a few detours before coming up to the hotel since we couldn't check in until at least 4 o'clock. First we went to the Brotherhood Winery. It's so funny because this place seems like it's in the middle of no where, but in reality, it's the oldest winery in the United States. Funny huh? You'd think it'd be around more buildings or something.So we were going to take a tour thru the windery, but since it's the day after the Fourth, there was basically no one around. But my mom and dad did manage to get a couple bottles of good quality wine. ^_^ After that we drove some more and stopped at a place called Howe's caverns. It's this group of cool tunnels that we walked through and took a boat ride in. Although, I do have to say I think my parents ar eplotting to get rid of me, because in addition to dark hard to navigate caves, they took me and justing to an old historical village in mass. when they picked me up, and that place was full of large tricky steps, bumpy dirt roads, and winding narrow steep stair cases. A blind person's vacation frokm hell... *evil laugh* It's a plot against me, i know it. lol How was everyone's holiday? I enjoyed last night, not too many fireworks, so the cats didn't go insane. X-| lol I can't wait to get my schedule on wednesday...still waiting on AP's though; that scares me a bit. >.> (btw, barbara, what ever happened to the Euro class museum trip?) um what else?? I know I haven't updayed in a few days. I discovered I missed the mocrowave in the dorm kitchen entirely, so now I'm goin to attempt ""cooking my own food without supervision"" this one girl saw me trying to microwave a ravioli bowl the other night and she's like ""You're not supposed to cook your own food without supervision, it's against the rules"" Her name is Shiela. She's a nice girl, but man, talk about your suck ups! I've been calling all the adults by their first names here, I was always told I could do that, and so that's what I do. But everyday I hear this girl saying ""(in class) um, Maria--I mean Mrs. Goldstein?"" I made a reference to another superivisor suring club time on friday, and said Jessica, and Shiela cuts me off saying ""No, it's Ms. Eyrick, she's still on teaching duty, you can't call her Jess."" LOL right? well that's my random stupid scenario for the day. lalala, okay, I'm done, not sure when I'm eating dinner tonight, but I'll probably come back on later again tonight before I go to sleep, nto too late tho; I have to be up and ready at 7:30 to meet the St. Rose mobility teacher...he's gonna show me around to a bumch of different places throughout the year. You know, campus, stores, pizza places, church, and of course the crossgates mall. ^_^ TTYL everybody. Tell me about your 4ths in the comments k?"

"event","YAY I'm coming home again tomorrow. Won't see an update until I'm at least back in New York. I'm going bright and early tomorrow so I can be home with the family for the 4th. Holidays of immense importance rock my socks. ^_^ This first week of YIT (Youth in Transition) hasn't been terrible, it could be worse. Last night I went on a freaking chess binge night and played like 5 games back to back. All of a sudden it's way uber fun all over again, and I even managed a game this morning at like 6:30 while waiting for breakfast time to roll around. Oh, and did I mention how much I am totally sick of hearing about chinese food? A group of girls in the dorm ordered out last night and they got a bunch of food. Like enough to feed the entire house. Which is cool, but I tried some of it and >.< yuck it was less than good. So Somehow all the rivalry in the dorm over the Red Sox and Yankees mini-series had gotten me sort of into watching baseball games. The first two nights I didn't really watch, just updated on the scores and such. But last night It was all interesting because these two guys I talk to at night one in a Sox fan and the other is also from New York and just loves to bad mouth the Sox, saying Yankees rule all the time, causing annoying little tensions while watching the games. But anyway, these two guys were playig chess with me and while we're playing, I keep hearing that the Yankees and Sox are tied at 3 a piece for like the entire game. Not that I actually care, but it would be cool to see the Yankees win three in a row. lol So anyway, the game went into like 4 extra innings of overtime, and Everybody was having these random uproars each time there was a great save, or double play, oh and the ""mosh pit"" like jump catch that Derek Jeter made, where he landed in a crowd of people. lol So Aside from the fact that I somehow started to get into it, when it started getting kinda boring from the repetitivness of outs and blah blah (see I told you I don't really like baseball that much) I was tempted to just go up ro my room, but when Steve (another supervisor) said ""Okay, if the Sox don't score this half of the inning we go to bed"" and then they did score, the game tension heated up all over again, and Steve and Carlos let some of us stay up to watch the game. So even though it started getting majorly tedious, I wasn't about to pass up an opportunity to stay downstairs past curfew. LOL Well that was my exciting night last night. Today I double period of personal managment class, and was ""tested"" on all kinds of annoying things like knowing when to pour you liquids so you don't spill and look like an idiot. lol Oh, and People Talk is the BEST class. (ultimate sarcasm) It's when you sit in a big circle and talk about your self esteem and do weird exercises like imaginary RP'ing in a situation where you meet a complete stranger and are supposed to practice different ways of telling them about the fact that you have a vision problem. (ie college orientation) come on! I've handled that scenario completely fine to now...all you guys found out about my vision thing as it came along, and you all weren't even random people. I still had to think of creative ways to explain myself; and they came out perfectly well. lol Mobility class in 30 minutes, I think. We're supposed to go swimming later on tonight, but I don't know if I want to. Might stay in and have a superivisor help me study for the theory test. haha loads of fun, right? But seriously don't want to swim tonight. Just don't. Not really a reason available, but oh well.  lol. Okay, way too much laughing in this last part. just ignore it if it gets annoying. ^_^ oh, and randomness. We had the loudest thunderstorm last night. I was down in the den and shut the windows it was gushing so loudly. But the scary part: For a split second I had a flash of some frightened person in the window when I was cranking it closed. hello? no decent sight present...*screams* *whisper* ""I see dead people...."" lol j/k"

"event","haha, randomness today in the subject area. Actually not totally random...yesterday there was the repeated ruckus over the game between the Yankees and Sox--after the Sox lost miserably to the Yankees the night before, 11-3. lol I don't care much for baseball, but I guess I'm still being looked upon as ""evil"" because I'm a New Yorker and don't have my flags flying red. hehe. So last night was just as loud and active as the last also. Another new supervisor, Kelly. She's cool, omg, she had the coolest thing done in her hair. Firstly, its like as long as mine, and she's a licensed hair dresser. So she had long small braids, and had them all in a ponytail, but then there are these long long strings of glow in the dark beads over each one. It was awesome. She says she'll teach me how to braid my hair. (yes, I still don't know how...I know it's embarassing. lol) Oh, and because someone didn't know how to properly close the shower curtain, while I was right in themiddle of a heated chess game, Micah randomly is shouting, and I walk into the kitchenette to find the light is leaking. Yes I did say the light was leaking. Apparently not closing the curtain properly, the water splattered all over the floor and then dripped all the way through to the floor below. Not necessarily so funny, but there were pots and buckets on the floor like it had been raining for hours. I turned off the light so no one would get electricuted. heh, that would be bad. Today the morning zipped by. YAY. We had fun making plaster masks, but I did it on my arm instead, the plaster is bad on my face. Did it in 7th grade, the after effects were less than comfortable. lol I'm getting more and more used to the new people everyday, so everything seems to be going pretty well, and I spoke with someone about making sure I get a teacher to review braille with me while I'm here, so it's easier and easier to talk to the administration too. *waves because things are good* Micah, one of the supervisors saw these designs I drew on the blank shirts we made. She likes Anime! ^_^ *happy* Although the stricter curfew is about the only thing that I wish they could be a little more flexible about. We're mature! lol Shopping later, can't wait! And because I was smart, I ran and took a quick shower after the project and before lunch. All that plaster and vaseline, and you know there is gonna be a huge wait to get a decent shower...I took a head start. lol. ttyl guys, coming home on staurday! Yeah 4th of July!"

 So I left for Massachusettes again on Tuesday morning. Like four in the morning...lol It was an insane ride over here, 7 hours, too many cars, and a road that appears like it will go on forever. And I mean forever. So now the ""boarding house"" I was staying in has twice as many people, and they're not adults, that's for sure. I think I'm one of the oldest, with the exception of one 21 year old. But I guess I'll get used to this, just like I got used to the other program. I do miss the other guys though. They just seemed more together...you know, because there was only 7 of us, and they were more on the ""older side"" I don't know. One of the girls is only 14...maybe that's what I mean. I stocked up on easily prepared soups and stuff this time; no one wants to be caught without a meal again. lol Now I have a different class about every hour, instead of 8 hours of computer class, and I have a lot more teachers to get to know, but they're not that bad either. I still see Heather, Brian M. and Brian C. around too, so that makes me feel a little better. Only one roomate this time, she's 16, and pretty friendly. And it's good to know I can still get up early in the morning and I didn't wake her up. I like having the house quiet and alone when I wake up. Privacy is a very good thing. Kinda miss Brian Follett. (That kid that was annoying the heck out of me.) because he always seemed to lighten the mood, and yeah, all the ""guys"" talked to each other, and they had all been here before, and interacted with the older adults and stuff. But I can still e-mail them, so it's cool. Yes, i'm rambling a bit. I'm probably falling back into my routine updates and such during lunch. I get a whole hour, and it only takes me 5 minutes to eat and get over here, so I get plenty of time to other things, and have some solo down time. Coming home for the Fourth of July, and then it's off to Albany for St. Rose's college oriemtation, (Math placement exam...*Screams loudly*) I won't be back here is Mass. until Thursday, so I get a nice little quick coming rbeak from all this. Meet the people, spent three days with them, leave for 5 days...sounds good to me. I already miss the house since I got a chance to come home. ^_^ Fab 5, if you guys are doing something, what's up? Barbara driving is definitely a good thing. hehe. Taking lots of different stuff, I have communication skills and personal managment later on, but I also signed up for lots of ""awesome clubs"" which you will all be hearing about as they come up. lol. I'm not sure which ones I'm in yet, but the schedules for activites are also distributed later on this afternoon, so you'll all read sooner or later. But there is one cool thing for sure: There's a shopping club. lol Can you say ""Boston Mall Exploration?"" lol Okay, gonna stop now, sorry I haven't updated in a while. ttyl ^_^"

   I got so much sleep last night its ridiculous and almost stupid. lol And omg talk abut inhaling your food. lol My mom apparently went to cooking a little bit before I got home. I think I freaked her out a little because it took me a little while to get out of the car since I had so much stuff, and she asked me if I really wanted to come home. haha. And you want to talk long hugs? I don't even know ow long it was... who cares. YAY for cats nt spitting at me because I smell like a million German Sheperds and lots of different people. I missed my kitties insanely, and yay they still love me! My mom made her awesome macaroni with fresh sauce last night; it rocked my socks! And even though it sounds totally unlike me, I think I like inhaled my food. She had to tell me to slow down I was eating so fast. But seriously, I haven't eaten a full plate of food in the last two weeks. LOL. hey, I just paused my writing and the graduation picture came in the mail. It's pretty! Have to find a frame to fit it.

I'm just so freaked that time flew past insanely. I'm gonna be back again on Tuesday, with a whole new group of kids between 14-17...woo So yesterday, I tld you all about my patheticness with the crutches; well I earned three new nicknames yesterday with them. Brian Charleson-old crutches, Brian Follett-gimpy Heather-Hoppy lol. oh well. so the day will before before I know it, we're going to watch the people in the other program this morning; they're graduating. lol feels like classes the day we left ASJ. oh geez, there I go mentioning it again. oh well. see you all tonight.

  so it's thursday. I can't believe the two weeks flew by so fast, or rather, as fast as they did. In the beginning it was sooooo slow. But anyway, back in class again. Went canoeing again last night. haha you'll never believe what that handed me. Sure, I had a really good time going out on the wanter last night, and Paul and I ordered in a pizza. (X-tra large is normal size for us lol) so it was a good night.) but hey, even out in the semi-real world weird stuff takes place. lol So I was fine last night, having a good quiet evening, and the minute I come back into the house from sitting outside on the nech with a bunch of the guys, there's this stupid bout of Trevor going to try and I think tackle another of the guys that said something offensive to him. So yeah, just like in ASJ, I somehow manage to avoid any sort of odd ""danger"" that takes place like only 5 minutes before or after I'm there. *laughs at shelteredness* So that was the one incident. And then, this morning...Like I siad, I had a really great time canoeing. Carlos is a fun guy, he took me and Kevin out, and while we were going upstream, he was telling us stories about his home in Bolivia, before he came here about three years ago. The incident as it is in itself, happened actually this morning. I went to get out bed like normal this morning and the minute I got up to go to the closet, I fell. I was like ""okay....weird much?"" so I tried getting up again and my knee started cramping really bad. Like when you leanon your foot for a long time and then it tightens up after you step on it. lol so I managed to hop back and forth to my closet to get changed, and then after that I pretty much hung out on the bed slowly trying to move my leg so I could getup and walk. No luck. It's quite annpying to think I got injured in my sleep. IN MY SLEEP! lol So the nurse finally came up, got me an ice pack and a pair of crutches. *laughs again* I'm sorry, this is just one of those things that's goingto the tope of the ""stupidest accidents"" list. I didn't even do anything! I haven't used crutches really...it was kinda hard getting over here to class, but now I'm okay. I just took some motrin pil, so I plan on ditching the crutches at or before lunch. man, I was trying to avoid injury at all costs. oh well. It makes for a little random amusement. Who wakes up and can't walk? **Barbara, hope B.U is giving a good impression**  Well, g2g. tonight's the cookout at Brian's again. Hopefullly no more accidents. hehe. tomorrow's the end guys! can't wait to see the WI crew graduate on Saturday! Later. ^_^"

I also heart normally sized pizzas. Watch out Barbara, don't order pizza while you're up here. They are insanely smaller than pizza on LI. I mean I ordered from Pizzeria UNO the other night, and they're a little expensive, but geez, all pizzas around here are not what we consider ""regular size."" lol.

""They are the bane of my existence."" I miss ASJ. I know that sounds completely insane, after all, who would miss it already? But really, I do. Especially beause we all can't be together so you can all hear my strange stories and adventures inthe outside world, and comment on them irrationally to my face. Only throu Live Journal. oh well. I did think about those Juniors on our stairs yesterday and it made me sad. They have no right!

  omg, I miss like only two days of posting and you guys are seriously updating like crazy! I probably won't be able to fully read all these entries until this weekend when i get back. It just takes too much time to read them here. lol. So Like I said how I had been booted out the media library on saturday morning; I never got back in. With no supervisin, I'm not allowed to be in the computdr lab alone in fear that i might hit my head into the door and get injured and sue. lol yeah right. So there is something quite interesting going through my mind right now; it has to do with a boy. however it's so long and confusing there's no way anyone would get it if I tried to explain it to them in this stupid posting. I went bowling saturday noght. Yes, I know that sounds ridiculous for blind people to do...even I thought so at first. Because I mean what would be the point other than the fact that you are blindly (excuse the pun) just tossing the ball somewhere you hope in the lane. Well I was wrong. It rocked. And pllus it wasn't regular bowling like we think of bowling. This was something called ""candle pin"" bowling, and the rules are a lot different. In a lot of ways it's way easier. However it does have its massive drawbacks. Theballs are all equally sized and are about no bigger than a shotput. You get two frames per turn and three rolls per frame. and every time you roll, if you don't get a strike, the pins aren't cleard. You can use the already knocked down ones to help in the next rolls. It's too bad it doesn't really exist outside of massachusettes. lol. I had also gone for a walk in the park with Heather and Trevor, walking down the charlez river. It was a really nice day out on Saturday. But it did get kinda hot. not too bad though. And as far as yesterday goes, no class, no activites. I found ways to amuse myself. everyone thinks I'm this prodigy violinist. *blushes really red* lol So now we're back to monday again. Poker night tonight guys. hehe ttyl and four days to go!"

"event","hi everybody,
  it's lunch time again. I do not eat curry. *winces* lol so in attachment to my last entry, i know you're all going to laugh hysterically when I tell you a few of the things that happened between last night at the BBQ and this morning before class. (and some parts that landed inbetween) after eating last night, a bunch of the group went swimming in the pool. While I was talking with a couple of the boys and the teacher; she was starting to clean up some of the paper plates and soda cans and stuff. So when we were talking I was helping her clean up, and she runs up to Brian's deck to go inside the house and wash some bowls. Well all of a sudden out of nowhere she comes back down the sairs and is clutching her wrist with a napkin, and Brian had to tell everyone to get out of the pool because there'd be no one supervising. (blind people in a pool alone....not a good idea) So everyone gets out and is drying off. I managed to figure out what happened right before Heather ran inside with Brian. ...She slit her wrist. *gasp* nah, it wasn't as bad as you think it was. The thing was, when she went inside to wash some of the bowls, one of them slipped out of her grip, and fell and broke. subsequently, a piece hit against her wrist and cut her. The good thing was though that the cut was incredibly shallow, and no, there was no trip to the hospital. Just a really badly placed accident that sounded much worse than it actually was. lol Then while everyone was stuck outside of the pool, my one roomate Celeste, she starting complaining and just yelling out loud how she did NOT want to go back in the pool, and it was WAY too cold for her, and she thought it was so dumb how everyone had to get out just because Heather and Brian went inside. *shakes head* what are you gonna do with some people? After we got back to the hall, things got progressively worse with her. I immediately changed, and while doing so, Celeste went to the piano and started playing right away and singing incredibly loud; enough for the whole house to hear her. I come downstairs and after a while everyone started making cracks about the singing because everyone once in a while, she would randomly belt some note. And I know she's partially deaf and it's not her fault her speech is bad, but I mean facts are facts. She can't sing well. So after a while the supervisor took Veleste away form the piano and she got all ticked off after that, and its still continuing. She says ""I'm as popular right now as Diana Ross and her drinking and driving."" lol So she got all bitchy with me and my other roomate and when I tried to turn my fan on because I was hot, she snapped and was like ""can you shut that off?! It's so annoying!"" *sigh* so I basically blew her off for the rest of the night, and then in the morning I walk up to the room (I had woken up, showed and stayed downstairs after 3AM) and the two other people are fighting with each other. Ahh the joys of rooming...I can't wait until college. Yeah, so that was my entertaining evening and morning. The only thing I'm afraid of is the fact that my other roomate is going homet his weekend and I'm going to be stuck alone with Celeste...oooo *shivers* We get to go back to Brian's house next thursday, so let's hope for no repeats. lol. Oh, and here's some funny stuff. When I was sitting talking with some of the guys last night, we somehow got into a conversation about alcoholic beverages, and about how I'm such a novie because I've never goten drunk. Everyone got to acknowledge the fact that I've never even tried a ""girly drink"" like Smirnoff, and that one guy Brian (not the BBQ brian) was basically asking me questions and determined that I ""should"" drink stuff like mike's hard lemonade, smirnoff or absolute. He was pretty much mocking me because I said that I only really ""liked to drink"" wine cooler or malts because other alcohol is too bitter. So he cuts me off and says ""wine coolers? you drink that stuff when you're like 10 yearws old. You need to move up a lot, and fast."" LOL can you imagine? Me, determining my favorite drink and then obsessing about it. ha ha ha. Yeah right. Maybe some other time. There's the randomness. I apologize if my entries are getting tedious and annoying. you can tell me. part of this is venting about the experiences, and part of it is for you to read or skim or whatever and get a laugh because some of what happens is quite funny. :-P I'll probably have a lot more time to sit on the computer b/c tomorrow is saturday, look for me, hopefully I'll ttyt. ~Later"

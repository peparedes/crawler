"event","Truffles 1.0 (special dark Hershey's chocolate): Too much cream to chocolate, belatedly adjusted but still too soft at room temp. Easily overcome by keeping refrigerated. Results halved between rolling in cocoa and powdered sugar - I personally liked a combination, but coworkers (who kindly reviewed results for this experiment) voted for the cocoa.

Truffles 2.0 (special dark Hershey's again): Did small batch and upped the chocolate content. Still not solid like store-bought at room temp (I keep wanting to write RA, for Room Air, like I do at work). Still tasty. Might roll in cinnamon later.

Dulce de leche for omnomruffles, 1.0: Way overheated. I'm using the microwave recipe at Cooking For Engineers and ended up with very very dense (not so much solid as rubbery) caramel. I tried adding a little cream to make it more spreadable, which works a little, but still is pretty much a milky-caramel solid.
Dulce de leche 2.0: Same recipe, this time not overheated. The texture is correct, although it doesn't have the pretty caramel color, which the prior recipe had. I suppose I could have tried heating a liiiitle bit longer, but didn't want to risk it. Tastes like a very milk-y caramel sauce (with a tiny touch of vanilla, which didn't actually improve the color like I'd hoped). This is the one going into the truffles.

Truffles 3.0-3.4 (Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate): Okay, these are the omnomruffles. First I tripled the recipe, then once the chocolate and cream were mixed I decided to do quarters. What a fun idea that was! I carefully figured the correct ratios for the various ingredients... and then realized this would have been a great time to have a kitchen scale, as I would have no idea the correct division of the melted chocolate mixture into quarters. Duh. If I'd had a scale I would have weighed the bowls (tried to write bowels - thinking of work again) and then made sure each portion was correctly divided. Also could have divided the cream and chocolate prior to mixing, but didn't think of this. Alas, alack. So this was pretty unscientific at this point. Division was as follows:
With nutella
With nutella + dulce de leche
With peanut butter
With peanut butter + dulce de leche

The nutella mixtures began to separate a little (that is, the mixture began to look slightly oily) before I was done. I think this is a symptom of over-mixing, as mixing the nutella then the dulce de leche in as the mixtures were already getting cool took forever. This would have been alleviating by either very slightly heating the mixture or having all the ingredients ready to mix. I'm not that good. The mixture does not look a thing like the Not So Humble pictures, but seems to be solidifying moderating well in the 'fridge, so I'm not worried (even if they don't - oh no, I'll just have to use the mixtures as frosting... woe to humanity). All of them taste very good, the dulce de leche not really adding a lot of flavor but just a little sweet-milky hint. I'm not much of a fan of chocolate-peanut butter, but other people are, so they will find good homes.

I thought about getting fun toppings for these, but the only one I kind of wanted to do was candied hazelnuts, which I though even the regular whole hazelnuts which would have required doing my own candying were too expensive (and then would involve more effort) so I think I'll just go with traditional for these, assuming they solidify sufficiently.


All right, so after All This Sugar, I had faux-parmesan brussel sprouts with quinoa for dinner. I am healthy sometimes!"

We've been trying to work on relationship stuff. A lot of the stuff I read has been pretty decent, although one of the recurring items that sticks out annoyingly is how the ""be the change you want to see in others"" ""support will equal the outcomes you want to see"" etc. etc. this stuff doesn't really apply to situations like mine (and other people's, unless I'm seeing a majorly skewed sample) where partners/spouses get a lot of support and it doesn't turn into the other side wanting to reciprocate, the other side gets to have the luxury of a supportive spouse while 'doing nothing,' essentially. I know probably a big chunk of that is unequal priorities and expressing needs and such, but still, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Second-Shift-Arlie-Hochschild/dp/0142002925/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253145299&sr=8-1"">the second shift</a> was not made by ""being the change you want to see.""
Otherwise, for the most part, the stuff has been relatively decent, and has a focus of ""you aren't going to change for someone, that someone isn't going to change for you, which only results in resentment, so figure out if it is worth it to stay."" One of the newer ones I passed along to Chris is even one of those with a ""and this doesn't mean every relationship is worth extending, here are some ways to work on things but it is okay if the best solution is to break it off.""

I need to go to work now, and won't get out before the hardware store closed. Bye."" Despite this irritating me, G. and I ventured out to Home Depot. I was wearing this <a href=""http://www.northernsun.com/n/s/1010W.html"">little tank top</a> that my mom gave me, and an ankle-length skirt. G. was wearing some flow-y clothing. Anyway, got our plumbing stuff, wandering around gardening, then went to check out. Because I hate self-check outs and the one human cashier looked bored, we were like ""yay! human cashier!"" and went over. So the cashier, male, age 16-18ish, reads my shirt, and asks: ""So, you're not like a feminist or something, right?"" 
Me: *fake gasp* Zomg, a feminist!
G. laughs.

G.: Not the man-hating kind.
Me: The kind that unclog their own toilets.

Recent stuff:
Angels and Demons - 
Whee! Science! Religion! No science! No religion! I like that it didn't fall completely for the ""But science can't explain the universe, stupid scientists, what will you do without faith? Probably kill yourselves, stupid eggheads"" and was mostly just running around the Vatican. Reading bitlets from the book apparently drops some of the silliness, but I thought there were less puzzles and more ""of course we'll go THIS A WAY!"" Okee! Still fun.

Terminator 3 -
Extremely stilted performances! If Batman just seemed to have too much emotional range! Heheheh, no, I mean, suspend disbelief and lots of explosions and evil mean robots. Whoever thought up robotic lampreys does deserve some recognition.

Night at the Museum 2 -
Similar to one, mostly cute, a few ""erm, what?"" moments. It would've been nice is Amelia Earhart wasn't quite so... weirdly stereotypical? Like the whole idea of her character was ""I'm a brash girl who wants adventure!"" which was great... except it was like they really didn't know how to do that. And could've really just focused on one museum, trying to cram all the Smithsonian together was daunting and left a lot out.

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies - 
I really did want to like this, however it does not quite reach expectations. I think the concept could have been done better. It was definitely approached with a ""Oh my god I HATE Pride and Prejudice it needs to be BETTER"" attitude, which I wasn't thrilled with (since I loved it prior). Also unfortunately, Seth Grahame-Smith just isn't that good a writer, so in essence it went from smart comedy to stupid comedy, falling on bodily functions and ""just how bloody can I make this??"" scenes to keep the comedy flowing. Blood is referred to as ""precious rubies."" Also irritatingly, the author can't seem to flesh out the whole ""mystique of the Oriental martial arts"" thing he hamfistedly introduced into the story. Lizzy is very proud of being trained by Shaolin monks and disparages the implication that China is inferior to Japan in martial arts training, yet her favored weapon is the katana. Mr. Darcy has his house decked in Japanese style (self-insertion much?), yet his house servant has bound feet. What? Which would be mildly forgivable if it was another stupid comedy, but it is Pride and effin' Prejudice. Why stupid? However, there are clever moments here and there, and for the most part it is still Pride and Prejudice, so 3/5.

The premise was shaky to begin with, and perhaps it is a sign of my age, but I thought the fact the father was uncomfortable sending his 17-year-old daughter to Paris alone with a friend's relatives, and later to follow U2's european tour across several countries with her 19-year-old friend, was an entirely reasonable position. I thought the mother was certifiably insane for her ""Oh, stop being such a smothering worry-wort, you silly ex-international government agent!"" attitude.

Anyway! We went to see Spamalot, Wicked, Equus and the Lion King. Spamalot was tres fabulous, I'm really glad I went. I'd been feeling kind of like <a href=""http://xkcd.com/16/"">this</a> about Monty Python in general, so while I wasn't exactly reluctant to see Spamalot, it isn't the top of my list of shows I was looking forward to... But I loved it. It really, really made up for the years of repetitiveness by being clever and new and just insanely fun. I'm dragging Chris to it while it is still on Broadway (mid-January). 

Wicked was amazing, as expected, seeing the show opens up some of the story, making it more understandable. I'm renting Return to Oz for Chris to see, because that is to me an example of taking what was already in Oz and making it just a touch creepy and odd. Not having to add a lot of stuff to it, like the Wicked and Tin Man worlds felt the need to (not that I disliked them terribly, just always left me with a sense of ""did they need to do that?"").

Equus was excellent, and seeing it as a psychiatric nurse was kind of interesting as well. I read the little author note in the playbill about how he worried it would be dated, and there is some of that, for example placebos and 'neuroses' are mentioned. But a lot of themes were there, as well as Daniel Radcliffe portraying a schizophrenic very well. Not just being delusional, which I imagine in easy to act in a way, but also the negative schizophrenic symptoms, the inability to grasp social situations, to understand human interactions, the flatness of expression. Very well done. Richard Griffiths was good too, although I didn't like his part AS much, the ""oh why can't I be passionate like my crazy patients?"" I didn't really buy. Not that he portrayed it badly, I thought he was very believable.

Lion King was pretty cool, I teared up a little during the stampede scene. Ingrained into my brain from childhood, I expect, it's not like I don't know the story and was surprised! Sniffle. It was very interesting how it was done, the human and animal combination costumes. Puppetry some.

Also went to Strawberry Fields, the Museum of Natural History (I love it. I want to live there. SCIENCE! Next time I want to check out the evolution exhibit), and Battery Park. I had an hour to kill before leaving so I tromped through Central Park for awhile, which I really liked more than expected."

"event","The proposed theory on the antidepressant effect on neurons as akin to pizza delivery porn will have to wait. 

Firstly, eee! NYC tomorrow! Bus leaves at 7am and I get there at 11:05am. Yay!

Secondly, I went to a presentation on domestic violence today. I was really glad I went, <lj-cut text=""it cleared up a few concepts."">
Current statistics are indicating that non-escalating, frequently mutual, arguments turned violent between men and women make up about 44% of domestic violence situations, and it is roughly equal men and women participation. This IS an anger management situation. This IS where I think we're seeing a lot of women being violent towards their partners, not as part of system of control and punishment, but in not being able to manage themselves well. And their partners join in sometimes too. The difference between this group and the next one is that there is remorse and hope for change. I don't think it is okay, but it is different, and there is a lot more room here for just leaving your partner if they don't feel like working on controlling themselves. Or agreeing to being mutual punching bags, whatever. There is room here, as mentioned, for anger management and for couples counseling. 

Two other groups make up the remaining 66%, a bigger chunk (29%) is men violent against women as part of regimen of control, of emotional/sexual/economic abuse. It might not be the most violent, as much of the control is in other arenas. They're calling it intimate terrorism, although I'm adverse to slapping 'terrorism' on everything personally, if it works globally - great. The remaining 23% is women fighting back. Homicide thereof is dropping, by the way, with expanded programs - no longer feeling like nobody believes you and the only solution is the abuser dying - has decreased those killings significantly.
And it is scary. This is not something, from all my years hanging around men and women's forums on the subject, that men really experience (statistic: 97% is against women from men). They don't talk about having a partner that watches their every move, that controls their work, their friends, their children, their health, their clothing, their own family even and goes up to violence against them. There isn't a lot of calculated, controlling and manipulation tactics that are the hallmarks. 

To give an example, when I worked at KB, I worked with B. B's husband called the store twenty times a day to make sure she was working and had not lied about her schedule in order to leave the house for longer. B's husband smelled her breath every time she came home to make sure she hadn't stopped at the bar with her friends. B's husband didn't 'really' want to stop having children, so B had more children, even though she didn't really want to. B's husband asked for her paycheck every week, because 'he manages money better.' B's husband, when he was angry at her, would ask a friend to give him a ride to her work, find her car, and drive it home so she would be stranded. B came into work with bruises and actively bleeding wounds on occasion. When she had been told her husband was cheating on her, she threw a handful of gravel at him. Was B an abuser for a handful of gravel? 

It finished with, first, telling us that batterer recovery programs are pretty useless in terms of preventing further acts of violence. However, follow-up is not necessarily useless. Because the classic batterer is smart and controlled. Someone might show-up at any point, they will take care to hide their abuse. After that was a video interviewing two men who had completed a batterer program. That was terrifying. The way that they said, clearly, they waited until they were married, or until they'd been together a long time, before they started being violent, the way they minimized everything ""I came at her with a <b>machete,</b> but to spank her. I liked to test her, you know, just so she'd know I could get a reaction out of her every time because I knew her, I guess the worst was when I tried to <b>hit her with my car.""</b> And how they would lie to everyone about actually being a victim, about their wife being a crazy drunk, how they'd purposefully engineer the situation so that when they knew the police would show up the police would think it was the wife's fault. 

Not everyone was thrilled with the program. It scored best with the people already involved in domestic violence treatment or assistance, and worst I'd say with our substance abuse and counseling folks, who didn't want to hear that counseling doesn't do much good or that abusers lie loudly and long about being the abused.
It was biased, sure, the woman having her background in domestic violence counseling and not in batterer programs. But I've heard plenty of the other side and I'm just not buying it anymore. I'll agree there are wives/girlfriends that are violent towards their partners, and there are a small percentage where it is the other way around, and that small percentage should be able to have access to treatment or protection where appropriate."

This is why vegetarian/veganism is considered a flag for anorexia nervosa. I'd love for the two to be separated, and this girl may, legitimately, want to help the animals. It is an exceedingly common thing to want to do. However, the fact that she considers herself recovering while only wanting to eat 400cal a day is telling. If she'd said ""I'm trying to up my intake to 1500 and need help accomplishing this without meat and dairy, oh and I'm poor!"" the community would welcoming. Instead it came off as ""hey! my calorie intake is absurdly low, but in recovery, 'kay guys? So don't judge! Just give me negative calorie vegan foods that are cheap!""

"event","So, I'm working last evening. Around 5:30pm the night nurse calls in for the silly frivolous reason of his elderly father vomiting blood. We have only one nurse for the floor on nights. We have a float nurse, but she was already needed on another floor - their night nurse called days before due to not being well enough post-surgery. Absolutely no one willing to come in, as it's Sunday, we're short staffed anyway, etc. BL and I (neither of us having worked a night before) agreed that I'd go home early, she'd have the floor until 0330 and I'd come back then. Which I did, exhausting me and making me pissy about my day off being 'ruined' blah blah. (One of the reasons someone didn't come in was ""it'd put me on 7 days in a row!"" - which is what I ended up doing) I got out of report at 0735 (only 5 minutes late! ha!), got change for a five to ride the bus, got home at 0830, got to sleep around 9ish-1pm. It was really only sheer luck that it was BL and I working, because probably nobody else wouldn't have agreed to this arrangement.
Only minor suck is that although I will probably get critical pay, I won't get overtime except for maybe two hours, since it wasn't in a row and I left about two hours early in order to get some sleep.

I made calls today and have found dealerships are very nice. Chris's car is going to be anywhere from $200-$500, depending on the make of the wheel (has been bad since December - hasn't been super crucial but we were planning to take mine to GenCon until the billionth death) and mine is going to pend investigation, which will determine what I want to do with the car.

I finished some very pretty socks and have immediately started another pair. Insanity!"

"event","Wheee! Unlike a lot of Upstate-rs, I've noticed, I really do like the city. Not to live in, sure, but I greatly enjoyed this visit and we're already planning another trip. The hotel recommendation was spectacular, right behind us was the Long Island rail into Penn Station, and had a nice little diner a block down which kept us fed cheaply. The big expenses, tickets for the shows and the hotels were paid for awhile ago, it was public transit and food which was a cost. And wouldn't have been if this hadn't been a horrible week for finances, but I digress. 
We went to a few stores in Times Square which was okay, but being broke and not a big shopping person to begin with wasn't that fabulous. We did go to the giant Toys R Us with a ferris wheel. We saw Rent (and ate the Life Cafe prior, woo) since it leaves Broadway in September, was very fun - even though I'm pretty sure I can recite the entire musical by heart, it WAS a fun production. The only thing, though, why wouldn't you update the stupid ""screening"" to reflect the current cast? How much can that cost? I knew who those people were supposed to be, but it looked kind of lame. I also liked that the current actress for Mark's mom is black, that added a fun twist to the whole over-protective jewish mom role. Took a bunch of random pictures. Saw Port Authority today, which was different, and unfortunately I fell asleep during due to not being able to sleep well for three days. :P But was awake to get enough of the general gist - was a three person, 90 minute show of three men, one young, one middle-aged and one old, telling about their lives that is very loosely connected yet similar. Enough so that you know they aren't the same person but the same kind of person.
Chris managed to embarrass me horribly by being Captain Oblivious - we went down 7th avenue to 30th street, there's like one block of gay dance bars and such. On the way back, Chris notices a sign for personals, and announces to the world ""WOW, IT'S GAY STREET! THERE ARE GAY PEOPLE ALL OVER! IT'S LIKE SAN FRANCISCO ON THE EAST COAST."" 
I hope no one was horribly offended that apparently my boyfriend was just paged by 1955 and omigod there are openly gay people in NYC.

I'm hoping next trip we'll be able to hit a few museums, and not have to be quite so cheap with meals. Pray my car doesn't die before then.
Theoretically next trip is GenCon, though."

We went to Disney Quest, Animal Kingdom and Magic Kingdom and was fabulous. We stayed in Kissimmee and could just vaguely see the Magic Kingdom fireworks from the condo. We debated spending less money on souvenirs/going out to eat and seeing circe du solei but voted for kitschy stuff this year. :)
We got back to binghamton about two hours ago, got the animals from the vet: 
Kennel person: ""Oh! Hank and Dean were SO CUTE, I kept sneaking off to play with them. I told everyone that if they didn't get picked up I was going to just take them home! And their octopus was so funny and that tube, so silly!""
Us: ""How was Zap?""
Kennel person: ""Loud.""

Zap's stuff from windy city arrived while we were gone, he actually now has too many toys to have out at one time - even with a couple on his play basket. But he's pretty cute.
I have new vegan-y shoes with that ""negative balance"" heel - I'm going to try them out today to see if I want to wear them to work tomorrow. They look pretty neat.

I get a transfer, either they didn't hear or didn't know that he pitched a hissy fit last night about being called at night, he's had out of control blood sugar all day, I call him and he bitches at pharmacy about the nurses. Then because I had to give him a massive dose of insulin, I check it again and although still critically (which means I have to report it to him) high, it has gone down - I call to tell him this and pitches a hissy fit to me about ""you people just think you can do whatever you want and then call me and it's not okay and you can find some other doctor, whatever doctor will put up with this, to deal with it because i'm not dealing with it anymore!""
I think one of the hardest parts is that this is nothing new, everyone says this has been going on for years, that he's always this nasty especially to the nurses. And it just reinforces to me that despite all their supposed safeguards and ""you just come and talk to us if this happens"" to ensure that the doctors treat the nurses decently, none of them work.

I saw a blurb about this on Inside Edition last night (at work, shut up, I can't make my coworkers turn off crappy news) that went on about how brave and <i>hero</i>ic she was and how upset she was over the hunts and how she cried and cried. Now, I don't LIKE dolphin hunts, I think they're repulsive and have since I first heard about them. However, this digs into me on the whole ""if it is a cute animal, it's heroic activism! If it's something stupid like a cow or a lab rat, it's terrorism."" The activists here were swimming up to the boats to impede progress, thus the pushing them away with poles. Interfering with a lawful activity. Not only that, but a traditional activity that had been going on for quite some time. People get arrested for doing that for white turkeys or lab monkeys. 

Probably I should explain my opinion on animal rights activism inc, but another day. For now, I'll point out the media is hypocritical in its coverage of protesting against death of turkeys (oh my god, turkey-day protesting is around the corner!) vs. protesting against death of dolphins."

""A recent survey found that 33% of those identifying themselves as born-again Christians do not believe in the physical resurrection of Christ. That means that almost a third of those professing to believe Christ died on the cross for our sins do not believe Christ rose again on the third day. You know what? If you want, you can call it a religion, or a glee club or whatever you want! But don't call yourself a Christian unless you believe that Christ lived, died for our sins, and rose again.""

And yes, I have trouble telling them all apart, I confuse Rosemary and Ursula the most. Ursula is smaller, but I only notice when they're right next to each other.

"event","Joy. My bf works at a supermarket, he goes in today to pick up his paycheck (I tag along) and his coworker comes up: ""Do you want a dog?"" Buhh? Turns out, someone left a black lab in the parking lot. Possibly she wandered over on her own. Collar and leash, no tags. Employees gave her some water and a sweat shirt, she's been there a few hours. I'd estimate age at 6-10 months old range, not over a year, I don't think. Very submissive, practically falls on her back if you get within ten feet, and licky. Hasn't made a noise but people have been constantly near her. Told him if no one claims her and none of his coworkers, like the ones that have houses that allow pets,* offer that he can bring her here and we'll find somewhere for her. I hope there is a grieving owner and comes and claims her before that though. :P"

""Let's steal living, breathing creatures that were used to educate people as part of a legacy to make a profit!""
Almost as bad as those that break in animal shelters or other education centers and kill the animals because they're malicious teenagers. Undoubtedly some of the animals will die for this ""heist."" UGH UGH UGH."

To follow on the heels of <lj user=""crowyhead"">'s find of someone thinking great female authors just don't exist, we have some mother and child completely lost on a school essay - ""write about a famous dead woman. Have five sources."" 
Because coming up with a famous dead woman is REALLY REALLY TAXING. 
It's not like you can just type it into google, hit ""I'm feeling lucky"" and find out about Madame C.J. Walker or anything! Oh no! ;P"

"event","I always get worried when I hear ""such and such pet is becoming popular!"" ""Designer""/""Hybrid"" dogs (yes, I know hybrid isn't an accurate term for them), whatever dog recently starred in a movie, when there is a movie about rats or a particular type of fish. I hear that blue-crowned conures exploded everywhere when Paulie came out. Or my stupid local paper doing an article about a pet. One of my friends here gets Small Mammal magazine or some such publication, and there was cover article about ""The Newest Exotics!"" including fennec foxes and flying squirrels.
Usually, these things focus on ""How They Really Make Good Pets!"" Even the potential negatives are cloaked, such as ""a sugarglider will need lots of attention, so snuggling with them all day is fine!"" or ""this dog needs a lot of exercise - perfect for the person looking to get into shape!""

While, in the particular case of rats, I'm happy to see people shed a phobia and enjoy them. New people coming in means better products becoming available, better information becoming common knowledge. However, for one thing these ""new popularity!"" things inspire a rush of backyard breeders eager to cash in, especially with dogs or other high ticket pets. For another, so many of these poor animals end up being mistreated - ""so my Nemo fish's water is brown and he's not moving anymore - what happened!?"" ""My rat has a large open wound and it looks kind of green - but I can't go to the vet because my parents won't give me the money for it!""

Popularity is a mixed blessing at best."

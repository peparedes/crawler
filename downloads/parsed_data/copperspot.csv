"event","HEy i just wanna say sum stuff that happened today and yesterday. So yesterday Tyler (AKA mean buttox)... pretended that Carlos asked me out and he lied to me . I was like r u serious ... serious ... seriously serious and he said yes so i believed him (i said no anyways). Then today at a track meet Carlos was like did Tyler (mean buttox) tell u anything by email or on mespot and he didnt say IM so im like no and hes like okay good cuz he said that he asked u out for me. and i was pretending i didnt noe anything about the subject.Carlos was like hes just trying to get back at me for what i did to him while he was going out with u and im like okay(Carlos has a girlfriend)
..... 

Other stuff that happened at the track meet --- I was like laying on the blechers geting a tan and then im like me butt hurts can sum1 give me a butt massage and then my friend Kasandra said to this guy ""Hey guy she wants u to give her a butt massage."" and im like u lier! it was funny ... MORE --- again i was laying on the bechers and i asked me friend Catlin if she could give me a massage (not a butt massage) and so i was getting me wonderful massage almost falling asleep when Carlos starts pounding on my back. and i wake up and im angry.... lol wow... MORE --- This is how Carlos is catagorized as mean in my list... okay so my friend Jessica asked me to hold her bag for her and not let anyone take anything from it (it had gum and tick tacks in it) then i was laying on the blechers geting a tan (again) and then i hear Carlos asking me if i want gum and im like sure but were did u get it and he like from Jessica's bag and then i got even more mad then i try to take it from him and he like help me she's rapeing me ... fummy stuff ... and i start to laugh but i put back the gum and then i find out that he got ticktacks and im like come on carlos put it back and he starts thowing them at me and then they fall off the bechers and i got even even more more mad! ... so then i got me lunch and he sit down in front of me and he like telling me stuff but i wasnt really listening all i was thinking was should i put this grape icey thingy in his face and i realesed me hand and there it went. but i barely got anything on him right so then he gets me hamburger (with kechup) and puts in on me back twice! and i almost start to cry and i just stoped talking to him. RESULTS OF THE RACE --- i ran the 4x400 which is that u have to run 1 lap around the track or 100 meters to pass the baton (its a reley) and my team (Kasandra , Genesise , Karen ,and ME ) got second place agaist the sixth grade girls in the other schools. Then another thing i had to run was the 800 meter race or 2 times around the track and i did horriable 9th place out of 10. and overall Golden Gate Middle got 3rd place and i forgot second place and 1st place was Gulfview. P.S. ~ They prataicly win every time (crosscountry).That about it kkk ...lol.... Bye!

Some are just not going to the same school which is Golden Gate Middle. The only why I don't complain about going to school is because of my friends. Bye

"event","Don't get me wrong I love no school days but its why we have no school that bothers me. Of course you know that its because of the category 4 hurricane Wilma. My sister whats to pack all ready. I wish it can just disappear in its tracks. Well anyways I hope our house is still standing when we come back. I've never been in this kind of situation before, a big hurricane and just thinking about the damage it can cause, it just freaks me out. People are lucky to live somewhere that never once got a hurricane. Of course I know that they get earthquakes and stuff but I just wounder why God had to make these things happen. Well, I'll enjoy my house as long as I can. Bye."

"event","Yea! Report cards came out today, guess what that means for me ... MONEY good old money! I have one hundred and sixty dollars! Let me tell you about how I got that $160.00, okay so it's my birthday right and my family all together gave me $140.00. I was alright with that but my sister got $150.00 for her birthday so as you can tell I asked my dad for $10.00 more. So, now I have $150.00. Now comes the good part my dad, sister, and me made a deal last year. The deal was that every A on the report cards is $5.00. Last year i got strait A's so I got $25.00 every report card. This year I got my first report card today, I got an A in reading, A in language arts/writing, A in mathematics, A in social studies, and a B on science/heath. Science and math is my low point, I can't believe I got an A on math (it's a miracle). So if you add 150 + 20 you get 170 right but there's a catch to all this. See I wasted $10.00 for a fifth grade dance, so that leaves $160.00 in cash. Cool right, well anyways I got to go my dad got mad last night because I stayed on the computer to late and he said I can't go on the computer until I practice guitar, bye!"

That's a big deal to my family because my dad just made a new bathroom. I what to bring my dog Baby and all of my pets. My dad said we can only bring Baby. How rude! Let me think ..... oh yea today my sister and I found .... YUMI! I taught she left forever! She was so weak though. I hope no one hurt my baby. Anyways at the end three little punky kids took her away, but I was not there to say something I was inside telling my friend. If I was there I would ... KILL to get her back (I MEAN WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE KILLING PART.) I need to go talk to people bye."

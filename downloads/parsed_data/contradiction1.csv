they have given each other the world. their relationship is very well balanced, as they are completely trusting of each other and blinded to all else. (2/sw). they are very much in love and will enjoy a good life (9/p). but, there will be a deep loss, a miscarriage maybe (that is the feeling i get) (8/c). then after some time, there will be a change, (tower), and they will have the family they hope for (10/p)."

"event","this is a new layout, looking at the energy of the month of feburary. i am unsure of the correct way to do this. this is from the circle of stones exchange, on aecletic. 



(F)orward--9/p (r)--there will be some sadness, some kind of loss
(E)nergy--emperor--there is some strength, some determination, possiably ---someone to lean on
(B)lock----8/p--this will take some work, some effort, and some care.

i apologize i am not real good at this kind of reading, but i did want to try. i usually read the layout as a story so i am going to try to combine the two.

because of some bad events and sorrow, you will find some strength you did not know existed. this could possiably be a friend, or romantic involvment you are unaware of. but, it appears that you have questions as to if you want to put forth the effort required to obtain, this goal. remember the old saying, ""what does not kill us, serves only to make us stronger"".

i do hope i did this correctly, as i have not taken the opportunity to look at mooncat's thread on this layout. any help or insight will be welcomed."

there have been intense feelings, but no relationship is possiable. things will come full circle. life will be good. there will be a change, the confusion clears then life goes on.

9/c(r)
what you want will not be achieved.

in the beginning locked approval, moved past the deciet, and develeping a wonderful relationship
things will be pretty much the same for now. 

why are you asking are things out of balance?

i don't remember this one.

upcoming meeting

yourself
5/pents   7/pents
you have mixed emotions. you know your stuff, but feel as if you don't win

superiors

10/p  4/sw(r)

you win some you lose some. there will be some opposition, but you can accomplish your goals. 

co-workers

Q/sw(r)  3/c

there will be some questions, some doubts, but overall will back your ideas.

advice

p/sw

be ready for action, pat attention to peoples feelings, use that to ""sweet talk"" and persuade them. use your intuition to know how to approach them. 

if you are just attending, and not presenting ideas, i feel you will be able to have some one on one with the powers that be. and will make some points that will pay off in the long run."

in the past you have been indecisive, let your emotions get away from you. at the present someone is not willing to give of themselves. things are just the way they are. in the future there will be a major change, a breaking of relationships, because of unfairness,and abuse.

2/pents  message (letter maybe)
knight/pents  mature-finish what he starts

you are a nurturer, and understandibly have concerns, he is more mature than you realize. he has the capacity to finish what he starts. even though you are pushing him out of love, lighten up. he has a change to make, and can not do that with you pushing him. i do not understand the 2/pents, and the message but that is the feeling i got looking at that card. 

update; b/f got a job, in a different field than what he was in. with a bit of a cut in pay. still don't understand the 2/pents."

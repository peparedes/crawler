I don't feel like trying to sell shit rapid-fire, because that ends up being more like a second job involving me getting rid of my stuff (although if there's anyone reading who might want a fair sized run of DC Star Trek comics that are signed by Peter David and Arne Starr they should talk to me. 70 some odd issues, more than half signed by one, the other or both.

"event","The time when things are at their worst, when trusted friends turn on you because the deluge of bad events in your life has caused your outlook to sour. It's the time when you need your friends the most, but instead, they ask one another behind your back ""What's WRONG with X?"" instead of asking you. When their politics clashes so with your own that they'd rather cast you aside or insult you rather than admit that both sides of politics are ugly and bringing this country down around our ears. When bad things pile up, it's ok for people to be in a black mood because of it, except of course, for you.

Maybe I AM getting to the point where I ""need help"" or ""need therapy"", but why would you think turning on me would make matters any better? Of course, so far, no one will come clean as to having problems with me behind my back, and I really don't expect them to. It would just be nice to know who I can and can't trust to have my back anymore, besides the handful that I know are beyond reproach.

And maybe I really AM going crazy. God knows people have cracked under lesser strains than I've been under this craptastic year. But telling me all the bad things are ""karmic backlash"" for my own bitterness and pain is bullshit. Telling me I am responsible for two deaths in the family (and yeah, Remo may have been just a pet to most, but to me he was family) from cancer, one of my most trusted friends dying, my father almost dying AND having more heart trouble, and my wife losing her job is a load of crap. How the fuck can anyone be responsible for things like that? But there it is, I'm a horrible, unhappy, bitter person and that's the cause of all these bad things. It's not the bad things making me unhappy and bitter or anything.

I know who the people who actually give a shit are. As for the rest, whether I weed out who they might be or not, fuck 'em. If they don't wanna be part of the solution, they are part of the problem, and I don't fuckin' need them around."

"event","Two in one day, man, I feel all prolific and shit. This one is all about Origins Gaming Expo in Columbus, which Pam and I decided to go to pretty much last minute because Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day were the big guests, as well as 3 of the best Star Wars novelists of all time-Timothy Zahn, Michael Stackpole, and Aaron Allston. I was kinda obligated to show for this one, as Wil was the last Star Trek: TNG cast member signature I needed to complete the entire crew, and he was only 2 hours away give or take. No way I could pass on that, especially for a mere ten dollar day pass to the show. So, on the road again, Fozzie. 
Pam and I arrived after a harrowing search for parking. Columbus sucks that way. But the entry line was way short, and Wil & Felicia were right there signing with lines that were also negligable to one who has waited almost 3 hours in other autograph lines in the past. Wil oohed and ahhed over my script from the episode ""The Big Goodbye"" which is signed by everyone else except Gates McFadden. I have her on a photo, story for another time. He was especially impressed that Uncle Mike had attached the shooting schedule to it, and briefly talked about remembering the soundstages they were filming on at the time. Dude was cool, definitely one of us fanboys at heart. Then we move on to the very lovely Felicia Day.

I had brought my Free Comic Book Day copy of her comic ""The Guild"", based off her web show of the same name. Got a great deal-a free pic after paying for an autograph, which I let Pam pick to get signed for her. Felicia was asking if I enjoyed the book, and talking about the art, when suddenly she stops signing in mid-autograph and points to herself on the cover (note:she was drawn in her miniskirted World of Warcraft game style costume SQUATTING on a sandy beach) and bellowed ""SANDGINA!!!!"" at the top of her lungs while sporting the most evil ear-to-ear grin! She and I started laughing, then her grin got even bigger and sh pointed to Pam and screamed ""I made her blush!!!"" To which Pam replies, ""I went there."" She was as red as the cover to my Trek script. Felicia looked to her, pointed to the drawing again, and said ""You're a woman, you know what I mean-what woman would squat like this on sand in a miniskirt? Sand in BAD PLACES! What was the artist thinking?"" She was great. AND she got Pam thinking about her ladybits, which is usually MY job, so good on her!

next was a lot of conratting, basic dealer's room stuffs, then we met up with Bill and Denine for a bit. I got all my books and a couple of con programs signed by the SW authors, and Pam bought the annotated anniversary edition of heir to the Empire direct from Tim Zahn, the author. He's a cool dude. So, for the third time in just around a month, perfect con for me once again! Score! Dinner with Bill and Denine was at Fado Irish Pub in Easton, one of our favorite places to go when Mid Ohio Con was at the Easton Hilton. Haven't been in a loooong time, maybe 5-7 years now. Still good. I spent too much due to beers and curry fries, bur it was worth it. The next show I'm hitting will be Horror Hound Indy in Sepember, where they will have several cast members from Aliens, including Carrie (Newt) Henn, who as far as I know has never done a con, at least, not in the states. Aliens was her first and only film, as she decided not to pursue an acting career once it was filmed. If anything interesting happens between now and then, maybe I'll come back and write about it."

"event","I've noticed there's been a recent influx of folks visiting my LJ here, and I feel kind of bad that I haven't updated since Pitts Con to give 'em something to read. So, here, have a post!

After Pittsburgh, life was boring until Motor City Comic Con rolled around in May. I loaded another full half-box of comics into the Rolling Box o' Doom (TM), my friend J.D. picked me up, and off we went to glorious Novi, Michigan. J.D. is a fellow gun enthusiast and concealed carry guy, and he convinced me that I should break my concealed cherry and pack heat, so I thought ""why not?"" and strapped the pistol to my hip. Michigan is an open and concealed carry state just like Ohio, and shares reciprocity with Ohio CCW Permit holders, so it was all good. J.D. checked with the con before we left, and their attitude toards carry was basically ""Just be intelligent and responsible."" Not difficult for me, as I have gun safety and responsibility was ground into me at a very young age. 

I did not costume because I was feeling lazy, plus being Silent Bob kinda sucks without a Jay, and the only wrestler there-John Morrison-wasn't worth suiting up as Cactus Jack for. Mick and the Divas seem to really dig my Cactus costume, but Morrison doesn't seem like the type to enthused about such things, and he was charging WAAAAAY too much for an autograph. J.D. however, donned his Umbrealla Corp. Security Goon outfit and, just to be amusing, holstered his very real Beretta openly in the shoulder rig (remember, open carry is legal there). He removed the mag and emptied it, but don't worry, he still had a live piece on his person. All day he got a lot of ""Wow, that is the best looking replica gun I've ever seen! Very Nice!"" comments. Only one person saw through it, but they thought it was cool too, so no worries there.

Anyway, on to con biz. This year they didn't have a map in the program, so finding comics creators was not easy. We managed though, and by the end of the show I'd gotten everything signable signed once again (exceptions being books for people who didn't show up. Jason Pearson FINALLY decided not to cancel on a show I brought his books to, so after three years he's now added to the collection). Happy Snoopy dance, everything signed in less than half a day!! Then the rest of my $$ went bye-bye to get Patricia Quinn (Magenta from Rocky Horror), Deep Roy (Droopy McCool from Return of the Jedi, all the Oompa Loompas from Charlie and the Chocolate factory, and Scotty's wee green friend from Star Trek, which he had just wrapped filming of part two the week before. Very Cool!), Cory Dee Williams (one of the Klatuus from ROTJ as well as his dad Billy Dee's stunt double-that's him, hanging from the skiff over the Sarlaac.) and a fella whose name escapes me at present that played a Gammorrean Guard in ROTJ. Incidentally, that puts the autograph count on the booklet from my SW Original Trilogy LASERDIC (yeah, I'm that old!) at 37 signatures, leaving very very little room left on it. To think, mark Hamill was the very first name on that book, way back on my 25th birthday. J.D. kept trying to trade me guns or buy it outright, but no way. Maybe I should see what he will offer me for my spare George Lucas autograph?

There was a big surprise-my buddy, Black Lightning artist Eddie Newell, was marrying his sweetheart right there at the show! He invited us, but we ended up having to decline because driver J.D. needed food badly; we hadn't eaten all day, we were done with everything else, and 4 pm was more than an hour away with nothing to distract us. I was bummed, because Eddie is a great guy and his fiance a real sweetheart, but to be fair, the wheelman gets to call the shots because ultimately, I'm on his time. So, off we went to hit up our favorite Irish Pub & Grub, Gus O'Connors. Now this place is authentic-the owner not only brings in Irish barbacks straight from Dublin on work visas, but the upstairs flooring is part of the actual original floor from the Guinness Brewery at St. James' Gate!! Bonus, the food is most excellent! Part of the appeal to going to Motor City has been eating there every year, and boy were we looking forward to it! But hey, what's that sign on the door? CLOSED PERMANENTLY? PROPERTY SEIZED? NON PAYMENT?!?!?! To steal a line from Father, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Fuckbeans, we had to eat at BD's Mongolian Grill, something we can bloody well do at home. Ah, well, at least we got to hang out there with Brian Smith and his friends, one of whom was Eric, the first comic shop owner I ever bought an issue of X-Men from. I hadn't seen him since 1990. Good bloke. But that was pretty much it, perfect show again, except for losing Gus O'Connors. Guess next year we will try the sushi joint, or maybe the Indian place. Le sigh."

"event","Ok, tomorrow is day one (for us anyway) of Pittsburgh Comic Con. Taking my usual box of stuff, we'll see if I can get it all signed or not. I'll definitely be coming back with two more from Stan Lee. 

Also, may have made the big score in movie sneak preview tickets. Just waiting to hear back from my ad agency contact. Keep your fingers crossed for me, gang!

Sorry I haven't been very interesting in a while. Life has been full of more downs than ups recently, and I'd rather not be bringing folks down when I'm feeling low. Fixing the bathroom has fallen through thanks to ferret injuries, a new cage that they only get half of because they refuse to be litter-trained, car repairs and other nickel-and-dime dents in the tax return but Pam's brother in law is a home repair nut and he said he'd help us for free. Probably in the fall, when it gets cooler. That gives us time to refill the coffers to buy plywood and hopefully a new shower. We can always replace the sink and the toilet later.

Ah, car repairs. Pam's needs ball joints. Mine is making a horrible scraping noise when I turn left, and a lesser scrape when I turn right. Yay. Dunno on mine, but hers isn't too badly expensive at least.

Right after I beat Batman Arkham City, our Xbox 360 gave with the Red Ring of Death. Shortly thereafter, they announces the Star Wars R2D2 360 bundled with the Kinect and the SW Kinect game, so we dropped a reserve payment on one. Paid it off right before release date on the third, and we're back in the saddle. Our friend Katie GAVE Pam a copy of the game Skyrim, which both of us are digging. Violence! It definitely helps to kick pixelized ass when one is in a bad mood. Things are getting better so far. 

Finally, Pam's job is sending her to Atlanta for the entire first week of May to train their customer service reps down there. That looks promising as far as her staying gainfully employed (we won't talk about how slack orders have been getting at my job, k?) since they told her that most of the phone calls will be going to Atlanta now, but she's going to be doing more e-mail and computer tickets here in Cleveburg.Less phone calls from cursing customers=less stress and anxiety attacks for Pam, and less chance of her freaking out and walking.

So, this year has been a roller coaster ride, and we're not even at the halfway mark. Feelin' pretty good right now, but hey, that's subject to change at a moment's notice, aye? Anyway, we delivered the bomb."

In 7-13 days we should have the money to at least repair the bathroom floor and hopefully replace the heavy cast iron clawfoot tub that is trying desperately to sink through the floor while we're at it. Doesn't look like we can tear down the spa tile walls and ceiling, but the floor is most important. The real issue there is getting the tub out of the bathroom and down the stairs. Hopefully we can sell the thing and make a few bucks.

The leak in our bedroom was repaired successfully by our new friend Mike. He caulked the molding back up, then went over it with a can of Easy Seal. So far, no more water has come into the bedroom.

The motherboard and chip from my ""good""computer are ok, the problem was with the video card. So, hopefully this Sunday, my friends J.D. and Steve will be able to stop by and help me rebuild the damn thing into the new case. If I'm really lucky we can reuse the dual layer burner from the slowass POS that I'm typing this on, as well as the memory card hardware. I really want to demolish this rage-inducing machine after I strip the good bits out, because it's just been awful.

I told my Uncle Mike, the former Hollywood Prop man, that Adrienne Barbeau and Denise Crosby were coming to a con in Columbus, and he decided he needs to go see them again. He worked with Adrienne when he was Property Master on Escape from New York, and Denise on Star Trek: TNG. Denise remembers him fondly as the prop guy who helper her and Micheal Dorn pull off a great prank. He got them a vaccuum, dust cloths and a can of Endust so they could whip them out during dress rehearsals to clean the bridge in protest of how little their characters actually got to do during several first season episodes. She totally freaked out (in a good way) when i brought my scripts to her to get them signed several years back, so I think she's going to be tickled to see him again. This should be a helluva road trip to the Big City, as we used to call it. Heh, I'm thinking of suggesting he gets a few prints made of a pic of himself, just in case someone might want to part with a few bucks for the autograph of a Prop Man with over 30 years of experience in both film and television. Hell, it's a horror con, and he worked on a couple of Friday the 13ths, so he might be able to sell enough pics on the side to pay for gas, heh!

All the ferrets are healthy and happy. They got to tear the house up for a while tonight and wore themselves out pretty good. It's hard to be unhappy when ferrets play. :)

Finally killed my phone (damn thing acted like it was possessed the whole time I've had it, it was inevitable really). I'm angry all the time, and when I'm not angry I'm down. Things are just piling up and getting to me. My coworkers have been kinda treating me like shit for a while, and when I finally snapped and called 'em out on it they were all like ""What's YOUR problem, we didn't do anything!"" which is BS. I mean, yesterday, one of 'em got all pissed because I needed his help to solve a problem HE created...and he was even more pissed that I had decided to stay at work instead of leave early cuz it was a slow day. Then later, he was all back to normal and being decent. WTF? Is it just me? Maybe I'm crazier than I thought.

Them, of course, there's the house issues. We've sprung a leak on the second floor, I'm guessing from the molding because the roof is still one floor up, and the Toy Room is dry, yet right below during the last storm there was water coming in from where the ceiling and wall join in our bedroom, and from the corner of the window below. The ceiling has never leaked before (that I know of), the window has just a bit when it storms and the wind blows the rain sideways. I don't do ladders, and don't know what to look for anyway. A friend is going to talk to one of his handier friends about having a look and maybe caulking around the molding, which will hopefully do the trick. Homeowner's insurance doesn't cover wood rot on ""surfaces that are exposed to the weather"", which is how they weaseled out of covering the porch when it rotted out, and the molding is ""exposed"" wood, so I can't even see the point in trying to make a claim.

My hair is coming out again from stress. That hasn't happened in a while. But it's been getting bad, what with the leak and now dreading to go to work because of what seems to be an increasingly hostile workplace. I wonder if the guys have ramped up their crap out of jealousy, due to the fact that I was asked to help out downtown when the mail room guy's wife died. I got asked first, because I was told I am the most reliable. If one of them over heard that, well...and of course, my supervisor could have told them on purpose. He and I don't see eye-to-eye a lot, and sometimes he seems very much like he's trying to undermine me with the guys to ""cull me from the herd"". Of course, he thinks Joe Paterno was treated unfairly by Penn State, so what does he know?

Maybe some of the stress will abate now that Pam has passed her math course. But I have to admit, the two weeks I spent working downtown were the most stress-free of the year barring my vacation, so I honestly don't know if things will get better or not. Writing all this tl/dr is helping some, but my stomach is still burninating."

Instead, after committing felony after felony, including multiple counts of perjury, this man who's family snuck him into our country illegally and lived for years with falsified documents gets praised-even by the very employers he has defrauded-as a great hero. WTF?

This is the type of person allowed to ""report"" the news in this country. Ever wonder why the news media is so biased on certain topics lately? Here's your reason. How many more ""heroes"" are ""bucking the system"" like this in our news media? Teaching in our schools? Flying our airplanes? Working in our government? Sure, it's hard to become a citizen, but then, isn't everything worth achieving worth a little hard work and dedication? Not anymore. All you have to do now is sneak in and find someone to falsify some records and make you a fresh, new identity.

I've been told that calling illegal immigrants illegals ""dehumanizes them"", and yet they are acting against the laws of this country. Would it be less 'dehumanizing"" then to call them exactly what they are, which is felons?  Should we stop dehumanizing murderers by referring to them by the name of their crime? Should we call rapists ""poor, misunderstood unloved men with needs""? I should fucking hope not. Why, then, is it so wrong to call this crime what it is? When a law is broken, that makes the lawbreaker a criminal by the very nature of their deed, and this <i>illegal alien</i> stands among said criminals with multiple counts of fraud. And yet he is a lauded for his misdeeds.

"event","Apparently the very embarrassed Pakistani military feels the need to sternly warn us.

<i>""Any similar action violating the sovereignty of Pakistan will warrant a review on the level of military/intelligence cooperation with the United States,"" the statement said. Earlier, the Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir warned of ""disastrous consequences"" if the U.S. staged a similar attack on its territory.</i>

""Disastrous consequences"". Really? from an armed force so incompetent that they did not notice the most hunted man in the world living right next door to their academy? Yeah, I'm shaking in my boots. This after the United States has handed over ten BILLION in aid to the Pakistani Army in the past ten years. That's billion with a B. And yet here we are, being threatened for taking down the big dog, because we embarrassed them on their own turf. By doing their job for them.

Dear Pakistan, I think TEN BILLION DOLLARS has been enough to soothe your butthurt (and I'm guessing the money will continue flowing so you will continue being our ally). After all, we COULD bring up the fact that your country was harboring a fugitive, a known terrorist who is responsible for a lot of death and destruction. Sorry we didn't inform you of our plans, and make it possible for someone to slip that info to him so he could get away again. Our bad. Just shut up and continue taking your money, because we'd hate to have to stop giving it to you. Capisce?"

*Now before you get your knickers all in a twist thinking this is some sort of threat, it's not.

Someone got angry with something I said in a comm (there's a shock, aye?), and came to read my profile looking for ammo to use against me. My <i>public</i> profile. Public as in, I have nothing to hide and can't be embarrassed by anything I wrote in it. While they used all of the above in an attempt at character assassination, the main point of their attack on me was to doubt the fact that I am married, because no woman would want a horrible horrible geek like me as a husband. Which makes me laugh a great deal, as I know quite a few geeks just like me who are or are soon to be married. I do so love the way folks on the internet just know EVERYTHING about you from a comment, or the things you like, or whatever. They've never spent even one second in your presence, but like Karnak, they JUST KNOW WHO YOU REALLY ARE. 

I gotta say that, even though I know it's kind of petty, I revel in their hatred. I guess I am a horrible bastard at heart, aren't I? Heh, heh, heh."

You have a problem with me, I get that. Why not come HERE to air it? Or at least do it on the sf_d post you linked to in your foulmouthed rant against me (oh, wait, you couldn't do that while using sexist terms like cunt and twat, because all of sf-d would call you out on your hypocrisy). 

I think you did it just for another chance to look at the OTHER link you sent me-the one filled with half naked children. Here's a clue for you-most people, myself included, are not nearly as interested in pictures like that as you are. Not cool, never send me links like that again. (And yes, I know it was a site showcasing the brutal beatings received by Texas schoolchildren, but it was STILL pictures of a nature which I would prefer not to see.)

Finally, did I say a single word in the post you are maligning so vehemently anything about being in support of child abuse? Anything at all? No? That's because I was speaking as to the therapy mentality of America, and pointing out that some people consider saying no to be abuse. Please, please get your facts straight when attacking me. Am I childfree? In the sense that I do not wish to procreate, yes. Did I go on a big ol' childfree rant? Did I ""baww""? Nope. Not a bit.

I find your ethics interesting-harming children is bad (well, duh!), but demanding I kill myself because you don't like something I said on the net is A-OK. Sorry, but I have no plans to kill myself anytime soon. You're welcome to come and try to end me yourself if you like, that might make for at least an afternoon's worth of amusement for me. :D"

"event","I've looked back over my journal here and noticed that I really don't write anything of substance. It's mostly about things that bug me, or ferret issues, and that got me thinking that maybe I really don't have anything much of value to say these days.

I thought about doing away with the thing altogether, but decided that would be bad because I couldn't read all of YOUR journals. That would suck, so perhaps I can just get off my dead arse and try saying something interesting once in a while."

"event","Buddy Ferret had some kind of seizure and passed away right in front of us. There was nothing we could do for him. The original Fab Five are back together, and our good boy is playing with them & isn't suffering anymore (he had adrenal disease, and was no longer energetic due to extreme age).

I don't even want to know what horrible things are going to happen to us next. Please excuse me while I go have a nervous breakdown.


<b>EDIT: After more thought, we think he actually had a heart attack rather than a seizure.</b>"

"event","Nice work. First you purposely throw a game over a hissy fit between you and the coach and Shaq, COSTING YOURSELF a ring. Then you put together this giant fucking slap in the face live press conference, preempting regular programming AND hijacking the commercials to feed your cause and YOUR EGO just to make fools of your fucking hometown and the town you made your millions in. When the Heat comes to town, don't come with them, because you are the Black Model-the most hated man in Cleveland. 

Hell, I am without a doubt the least homosexual man on the planet, yet I'd have a suck on Art Model's dick if he put a bullet in your asshole brain. YOU cost yourself a ring by being a giant fucking egomaniac and not being able to get along with the coach. Fuck you.

I wonder if all the folks you just screwed out of their jobs can find a way to sue you for lost income. I'm sure you won't care about them losing their homes while you live it up in your Florida McMansion. 

May your knees give out and finish your career AND your endorsements, you self-serving piece of shit."

"event","and I am hearing that fans are celebrating by RIOTING in L.A. Destroying the city over basketball, and a WIN at that (not that rioting over a loss is kosher by any means).

Seems the inhabitants of that city will glom on to any reason to pillage, loot and burn; perhaps they should change the name of the team to the Vikings? Or better yet, start shooting rioters like the animals they are. Maybe that will teach them that regular attempts to demolish the city is not, in fact, covered under a person's Civil Rights."

"event","Utah has executed a convicted double murderer-by firing squad! This was at death-row inmate Ronnie Lee Gardner's request after being given the choice of that or the gas chamber. Personally, I am rather in favor of this form of execution, as it's quick and fairly inexpensive compared to the other forms of execution (save hanging of course. A length of rope is, after all, even less expensive than bullets.)

Apparently in Utah, the firing squad has been eliminated as an option because some people find it too barbaric, but Gardner was sentenced before that change went into effect, so his choice was allowed.

It was protested, of course: <i>They also argued he could not get a ""fair and impartial hearing"" before Utah's Board of Pardons and Parole because lawyers that represent the board work for the Utah attorney general's office</i> (one of the men he murdered was his own attorney in a botched escape attempt at his trial)<i>, which sought his death warrant and argued against the board commuting Gardner's death sentence 
The American Civil Liberties Union decried Gardner's execution as an example of what it called the United States' ""barbaric, arbitrary and bankrupting practice of capital punishment."" And religious leaders called for an end to the death penalty at an interfaith vigil in Salt Lake City on Thursday evening.

""Murdering the murderer doesn't create justice or settle any score,"" said Rev. Tom Goldsmith of the First Unitarian Church.</i> Except, of course, if the ""murderer"" happens to be a doctor who performs *gasp!* abortions. Then it's A-OK, I guess. 

Apparently, this fellow was abuse both physically and sexually in his youth, and was addicted to drugs as well. I find it interesting that the fact he was an abuse survivor has been trotted out as reason to allow him to live on after committing murder twice. I don't see how that warrants a free pass, unless he killed his abuser in self defense. 

But then, I'm just a crazy person who is mean and anti-social enough to think that Utah needs to keep up the good work they started here."

"event","Well I just went and put 400 more down on the bike...and in another $3700.00 to go I will be the proud owner of my 1997 Kawasaki Vulcan motorcycle. I'm hoping to be riding it by October Fest in Daytona.....Hopefully all 3 of us will be riding.
Chris's bike is coming along slow but good. He is working on the front area and is 95% done with all of the painting....Can't wait to get this bike project done so we can see the bike and get to riding."

"event","Yes, thats what I said....Another good day.....Sorta.
My husband Chris lost/misplaced/had it stolen....His wallet..
all 3 of us tore the house up looking for this small and what seems to be insignificant object, until you lose it. There where things in the wallet that just can't be replaced, like pictures and little momentos......that really sucks, so my babe hasn't been in a good mood at all today, but he put on a good show when he took me to go see my new bike that he is buying for me.....Very COOL....I can't wait to ride it,,or should I say learn to ride it...
He go me a 1997 Kawasaki Vulcan, so Sweet,and damb I look sexy and good on it...LOLOL
World watch out cause if you get in my way I will just have to run you over...LOLOL
I try to get CHris to undrestand that all of this shit will pass and hopefully everything will get better, we have friends and family that love us and will help us to get over all the crap that seems to happen in our lives.....
Chris's bike is coming along good, I know he wishes that if would come along faster, but getting as detailed as he is on this project, patients is truly a vertue.....Patience is something that neither one of us have.....
I can't wait for all of us to get to ride together (Chris, Dad and me) what a sight that would be.....Hope everyone has a great day..."

"event","Well today was a better day. I went out to lunch with a friend and had a great conversation. We were able to talk about our past and present. It was clensing for both of us....
Great news......Chris got his shocks for the bike today and he also found out that his pipes are in and he should be able to get them by the end of the week. 
A friend that I haven't seen in awhile dropped by yesterday and we talked for awhile. Come to find out that he and his wife have been busy, not ignoring us....lol
Such the paranoia I have....But it was nice to try to keep in touch...."

"event","Just another day.......
Yeah, thats what it feels like.....Except with a few boomerangs thrown into the picture.
I have just found out that a friend of mine's nephew had just commited suicide. Its hard to talk to her because as some of you all know is that I too have attempted suicide twice in my life. Its not something that I contimplate now, but there were times when I felt that killing myself was what I had to do to end the pain.....
I didn't know her nephew, but I just don't know what to say to her. When someone try or succeeds in killing themselves, some people say its the easy way out.....Well I'm sorry to say but it is far from easy.....?What would it take for you to end your life? To leave your family with all of your bills, memories,problems that you couldn't deal with? Easy? Far from it......Unless you've been that depressed and that desperate that you feel as if ending your life is easier than going on for another day.....Don't say that that person took the easy way out, because that person took the hardest way out you could ever imagine.
Suicide is a very personal and emotional. And no you can;t just talk to someone and have that person make it all right. when you reach that point in your life no one can make it right....but they may be able to give you hope to try another day....so we shuld never give up on anyone who has or has almost reached that point....better yet, lets try to recognize way early if we see someone getting down and try to be there to keep them company or try to pull them up......we can't help everyone, but sometimes an ear is all we need....
Sorry for the depressing message but it just reminds me of how I was when I reached that point. No far how far I think I've come in my happiness and understanding I know that if it weren't for the people in my life who help me keep my head above water I'd have given up and I wouldn't be writing this today...Its just that simple.......Just another day......"

"event","Well here I go again......
Things are getting a lot better....I've finally have gotten over my cold....but instead I've given it to a girlfriend of mine (Sorry Honey):(

Things are going good in the tattoo world, things were slow, but now we're off to the races...Same goes with the piercing aspect of my life..always busy.

Been thinking about past friendships and wondering what happened, why have we all wondered apart? I realize that lives become busy, but to busy to call or write???? I can't really bitch though I'm just as much at fault as anyone....I guess I will try to make more of an effort to keep in touch.    And for all of you reading this, you try to do the same.
Well until later. Everyone have a wonderful day...."

"event","Well the ones that know me know that I am not into typing and talking a lot with IM's and all of that goofy stuff, but I am trying to talk and get out more......

So, Here we go.......

Things haven't been going very well lately....Chris(my hubby) and I have been royally screwed by 2 people in the last 3 weeks....The first person has been a friend of ours for several years and he had/has a drug problem and needed some help. He told us that he has been clean for sometime and he was having that urge again....Well we let him move into our home so he would have a more of a stable life. Well it was stable enough for him to take our stuff and pawn it at the pawn shop.....Bad, Bad, Bad week.....

Then we had another person who we brought into out business and gave job....the only thing we told him was that you 1.Don't steal from us...2.Don't lie to us.....Well
both of those came true this past weekend when he stole money from the money drawer to go and buy drugs,,,,which we DO NOT CONDONE...... and lied about it.....Then he came to us and admitted that he took the money and that he used it to buy drugs but he would never do it again....well he's right because he don't work for us anymore....

But besides that I have been fighting a hell of a cold, and I hope that I am on the last part of it because it has been kicking my butt......"

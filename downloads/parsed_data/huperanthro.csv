"event","DC has long had a reputation for unambiguous heroes, clear divisions between villainy and heroism. This reputation is mostly undeserved, but there is a little truth to it. 
<IMG height=302 width=200 src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/08/Xenobrooddc.jpg""><IMG height=302 width=200 src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/PrimalForce_0.jpg"">
Characters on covers-- and throughout most of the interior pages --in the nineties invariably are either teeth-grittingly angry, in agony over the loss of a loved one/friend/bystander/arch-rival, wearing a mask that hides all expression, or some combination thereof. Teams always include a single massive ""brick"" whose only purpose is to charge into combat like a freight train, often while screaming angrily. There was a lot of anger in those comics.

<IMG height=302 width=200 src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/Fatejaredstevens.jpg"">
See? Since he wasn't a <I>Doctor</I>, I assume that this Fate's anger may be traced back to getting drunk, dropping out of medical school, and letting a visually impaired tattoo artist get near his face, resulting in partial blindness. 

<IMG height=302 width=200 src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7b/Manhunter_chaselawler.jpg"">
Demonstrating the bit about masks is the sixth person to use the name Manhunter in the DC universe, Chase Lawler. Note the vicious, McFarlane-esque mask; the excessively broad epaulettes that prevent him from raising his arms above his shoulders. His fringed cape is long enough that he should be constantly tripping on it, or at the very least his foes should be able to grab ahold of it. The comedic musculature is another sore note- his feet are almost invisible below his overdeveloped calves, and his arms seem stunted and rigid.

<IMG height=302 width=200 src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/ZerohourcrisisintimeTPB.jpg"">
Of course, none of the above couldn't have happened if it wasn't for this little gem of a storyline. Didn't any of the artists from that decade stop to look at a model? Fabric just doesn't do the things they show it doing...."

The second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, was one of the first comics characters I ever obsessed over. He was also a second-string Steve Ditko creation desperately trying to be a first class hero. To me, Ted was a techie nerd who spent most of his time being the foil to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_Gold"">Booster Gold</a>'s jock grandstanding, and making sure he didn't screw up too badly (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeets"">a role that Booster usually seems to be incapable of operating without</a>) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Gadget#Cast_of_characters"">the Penny to his Inspector Gadget</a>.

You can understand that I was saddened when DC shot him through the head.

When DC brought in the third Beetle (no, not George Harrison. Wrong spelling), I decided to pick up his new title series...

...I don't plan on putting it down any time soon.

<IMG SRC=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/Bbnew.PNG"">

Jaime Reyes is a rarity in comics: a hispanic superhero who doesn't <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_%28comics%29"">give sensible readers aneurysms</a>. He's also an interesting, and complex character. He's not as astonishingly intelligent as most heroes (a solid B+ student), but he's a dutiful son and sibling, and a good kid in general. Circumstances have led to him having his parents and closest friends in on his identity, and he at one point seeks parental permission to leave the house late at night perform heroic acts. Jaime has a lot of mysteries to unravel and conflicts to deal with, but some of the more interesting aspects of the comic relate to where he lives, and what he believes in.

See, Jaime's a resident of El Paso, Texas. El Paso isn't a coastal city, unlike most of the places DC comics take place in. It's nearer to the border of another country than any other US city with a superhero, which may come to be important; news commentators suggested that one of Jaime's appearances at a border crossing suggested a personal policy on immigration, and speculated about the political leanings of the new hero.

He's also Catholic, which you might miss if you aren't. If you pick up an issue, take a glance at the family's house: a crucifix often finds its way into the background.

Among superheroes, it's pretty rare that any kind of religion is stated, and the blanket assumption even among the writers is that a hero without a previously described religion will be Protestant. Religious characters, especially Catholic ones, are often either <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightcrawler_%28comics%29"">sincerely devout</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher"">horrifically lapsed</a>; Jaime has yet to be portrayed as either, making him again a rarity. It's also pretty rare that a hispanic superhero will be believable, and it's even rarer that they're actually interesting.

Maybe this will redeem the fact that the writer had a part in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman_%28film%29"">Catwoman movie</a>.

That's a big <I>maybe</I>, though."

"event","One of the things that always bugs me about US superhero comics is that it always comes out seeming like there's a hundred American superheroes to every superhero who lives anywhere else, and more than three quarters of that hundred are from the northeast coast. Now, I get the reasons why. Superhero comics grew up in NY; Marvel artists openly placed their stories in the Big Apple, basing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_Mansion"">notable locations</a> on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frick_Collection"">local architecture</a>. As for DC, those with a literary mind might recall that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City"">Gotham</a> is another name for New York; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28comics%29"">Metropolis</a> is most frequently portrayed as being along the eastern seaboard, as well. The Marvel series <a href="""">Runaways</a> features frequent jokes about the general lack of heroes on the West Coast, and the past has seen <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_Manhunter#Solo_adventures""> a single hero </a>taking on the protection of almost the entire southern hemisphere in the DC universe.

Comics have a long, awkward history when it comes to portraying people outside the creator's own culture. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Eisner"">Will Eisner's</a> famed hero <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit"">the Spirit</a> was often accompianied by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebony_White"">Ebony White</a>; early X-Men comics (perhaps ironically, considering that team's reputation for diversity) painted European characters as villains in having the heroes face against <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad_%28comics%29"">The Toad</a> (British), and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_Witch"">Scarlet Witch</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_%28comics%29"">Quicksilver</a> (Roma). In part, this is due simply to the expectations of the core market for comics at the time, and the expectations of the comics creators of what their audience wanted to see. It is also likely due to the origins of the comics creators themselves; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee"">Stan Lee</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kirby"">Jack Kirby</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Siegel"">Jerry Siegel</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Shuster"">Joe Shuster</a>, the aforementioned Eisner, and many other now acclaimed creators began their lives as the children or descendants of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi"">Ashkenazi</a> immigrants to the United States and Canada. Raised with the same stories of the differences between their home and ""the Old Country"" that so many other first generation Americans faced, but without the actual experience of having lived in those lands, many comics creators incorporated Europe-- indeed, all parts of the world --as a half-remembered fantasy world of Gypsies and vampires.

Both DC and Marvel have made substantial efforts recently, although I can't speak to the validity of most of their characters, it's worth examining a few.

<B>MARVEL: THE ARABIAN KNIGHT</B>
In my last post, I briefly mentioned the Arabian Knight, a lamentable Marvel character armed with a magical golden scimitar, flying carpet, and a magic sash. Yes, he had a magic <I>sash</I>. Don't repeat that word too often, or it'll lose all meaning and you'll go crazy. Shirtless and wearing a turban that I'm fairly sure was never drawn in the right style, ""Abdul Qamar"" was the iconic hero of his nation/region, just as Captain America represented the US in superheroic form, or Union Jack the U.K.

Of course, comics being what they were and are, a crossover is inevitable; the archetypal Saudi hero <I>had</I> to meet <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_%28comics%29"">the archetypal Israeli heroine</a>. In the ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contest_of_Champions"">Contest of Champions</a>"", Arabian Knight is forced not only to cooperate with Sabra, but to battle beside her, a prospect he finds lamentable. When he refers to her as ""a Jewess"", even the neocon alchoholic arms dealer Iron Man (<I>how</I> can he qualify as a super<U>hero</U>? HOW?) calls his bluff, pointing out that Abdul's real problem isn't that Sabra is... well, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_%28person%29"">sabra</a>, but that she's female. So, clearly the real problem between these two isn't that their respective countries-- which they openly represent --hate each other, but that the Arabian Knight is sexist. <I>clearly</I>.

Sabra's been through too many costume revisions to count, but all you need to know to find her is to look for the superhero wearing white, blue, and a tiny <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David"">Magen David</A> somewhere on her person.

Abdul Qamar would eventually die ignominiously, briefly replaced by an even less-notable second Arabian Knight. However, the pages of Union Jack vol. 3 introduced a new heir to the legacy, Navid Hashim:

<img src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3d/Arabianknightmu0.jpg/369px-Arabianknightmu0.jpg"">

I'll admit I'm biased when it comes to this incarnation; he's one of the most attractive men in the Marvel Universe. While he too bickers with Sabra, and his views of her are informed by conservative beliefs about the role of women, his characterization seems more informed by genuine research into international politics and relations. Hashim is loyal to his country, a dedicated fighter against terrorist extremists; while he still carries the scimitar and sash of his predecessor, the carpet has been unraveled and fashioned into a more modern, sensible (although still magical) military uniform. Just the same, he hasn't been around very long; we'll have to wait and see how he compares."

A lot of times, someone will come along and say that they have a better idea of how to present an established comics character. This is often a response to falling sales or a perceived lack of interest. Sometimes, this affects a major, notable hero...

Other times, nobody's really quite sure. A character or group of characters may keep the same art style and personality for years, even decades without changing. Why, imagine what might happen if someone was to come along and completely change the style of a comic which has been recognized for a distinctive style for more than fifty years? What if you took something that had become an inextricable part of Americana, a way of recalling a Rockwell-esque fantasy US that never existed, and turned it into something new and fresh?

"event","<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman"">Neil Gaiman</a> made himself famous as a comics writer with DC, producing such notable series as <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_%28DC_Comics_Modern_Age%29"">The Sandman</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Magic"">the Books of Magic</a> under the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_%28comics%29"">Vertigo</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprint"">imprint</a>, he even returned <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brother_Power_the_Geek"">Brother Power</a> from comics limbo. These stories of magic and cosmic forces, geared towards a more mature audience than most of DC's content, made a solid impression that remains to this day. His character <a href="""">Death</a> became an icon even among those who did not read comics, her pale gothic style and frail beauty appealing to many a Poe-like youth.

So, I paid attention when he published a Marvel comic...


...the second time around. When I first picked up an issue of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_1602"">Marvel 1602</a> and flipped through it, I quickly put it back on the shelf. I was in a hurry, and it didn't look that interesting. More than a year later, I checked out the trade paperback, and realized my mistake. It's an easy one to make: at the outset, <I>1602</I> doesn't look that interesting. There are many pages which seem to simply be random characters in period dress conversing. However, a closer look reveals something very interesting. You see, when Mr. Gaiman finally wrote a story with Marvel characters, he didn't just put his own distinctive spin on them. He didn't only write their dialogue with the innate wit of the UK comics writers.

He took those characters, and he <I>put them <B>400 years back</B> in time</i>.

There are many delights in examining how superheroes and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_%28fictional%29#Marvel_Comics"">mutants</a> might develop in the 17th century, from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England"">the Queen</a>'s agent <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Fury"">Sir Nicholas Fury</a>, to the handsome and brilliant <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Doom"">Count Otto von Doom</a> of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latveria"">Latveria</a>. However, a personal favorite is Sir Nicholas's assistant <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man"">Peter Parquah</a>, a brilliant young man (though a poor climber) who keeps <I>almost</I> being bitten by unusual spiders...

"event","I'd been hearing good things about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Miller_%28comics%29"">Frank Miller</a>'s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_%28comics%29"">300</a>, an account of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae"">Battle of Thermopylae</a> in comics form. Now, there are a few things i've come to expect based on Miller's other work- particularly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Dark_Knight_Returns"">the Dark Knight Returns</a> (a gritty tale of a possible future which did much to dispel the character that Batman had <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_%28TV_series%29"">recently acquired in popular media</a>), and the now famous <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_City"">Sin City</a> series.

I did not find what i expected. Yes, there was much of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Mars_in_human_culture"">Mars</a> energy that dominates Miller's other works, so full of muscular men, slender women, and 90s-style comics ultra-violence. I've often been uncomfortable with the over-sexualized way Miller presents women, to say nothing of the sheer pointless brutality of some of his work (the worst of this is most likely <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Dark_Knight_Strikes_Again"">The Dark Knight Strikes Again</a>. Please, don't get me started on that one.)

However much i may be uncomfortable with some of Miller's themes, his tastes and style... i can't say he's a bad comics artist. He is an <I>excellent</i> artist, one of the best. He's the sort of artist you hate to love, who you wish would do something else; even though you know that the artist has the final say, you still want <I>something else</i>.

300 is something else, and it's brilliant in every meaning of the word.

Miller's strong Martian themes are suited very well to the telling of this event in history, if only because these are Spartans. I have little doubt that Miller put some of himself into the character of the soldier-storyteller Dilios, and indeed every other man in this book, Spartan and otherwise.

Above all else, I am astonished at the sexuality and beauty of many of the men in this book. From the nude athleticism of the Spartans and their king Leonidas, to the rich garb of Xerxes and his swarming armies, one might very easily miss the two pages of a writhing feminine form.

I must admit, I have some difficulty forming an unbiased criticism of this book. But then, I grew up on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Daulaires-Greek-Myths-Ingri-DAulaire/dp/0385071086"">D'Aulaires'</a>, and this is Sparta.

"event","Most superheroes have secret identities, and nearly all of them have some kind of home. However, it's a lucky few who have a <I>lair</i>. 

While the idea of a secret hideaway where a character can remain safe from any potential threats seems more in keeping with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman#Golden_Age"">superstitious and cowardly</a> character of criminals, there are some good reasons for a hero to keep a lair. For those who have a secret identity, the lair is a place you can relax without changing out of costume (or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent#Which_is_the_real_.22Identity.22.3F"">into it</a>). Sometimes this security is achieved through being <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude"">removed a great distance from threats, or being accessible only to the hero</a>. Other times, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcave"">it is cleverly hidden, often behind secret passages</a>. Some are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Mansion"">in plain sight, but are protected from intrusion by the abilities of the heroes themselves</a> (Westchester isn't exactly the middle of nowhere in the Arctic). A few aren't even secret, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_Building"">may even be famous within the world of the heroes</a>.

How a hero finds their lair is an important factor. Golden Age heroes often inherited or simply laid claim to their private domains, demonstrating the same authority and high birth that permeated every other aspect of their background. Later heroes may outright purchase lairs and refit them to suit their needs, while <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaways_%28comics%29"">others</a> go so far as to put an enemy's former lair to good use.

However, what truly makes a lair is not simply being a place to recover, meet with other heroes, or monitor emergencies worldwide. It is something more, as Nightwing notes:

<IMG SRC=""http://pics.livejournal.com/huperanthro/pic/0000a54f"">

A lair is a testament to the hero's ability. If <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom"">they are the latest in a long line of heroes</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_Cave"">it may serve as a memorial to the accomplishments of their predecessors</a>. Most frequently, they hold trophies and mementos from past adventures, or tributes to fallen <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Todd#The_Dark_Knight_Returns"">friends</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jor-El"">family</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Lor-Van"">members</a>. In essence, a lair is comic book continuity given form.

...no wonder they get blown up so often."

A lot of people remember the modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superboy_%28Kon-El%29"">Superboy</a>, also known in his early appearances as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superboy_%28Kon-El%29#Reign_of_the_Supermen"">the Metropolis Kid</a>. A hormonal teenage clone of Superman, he eventually came into his own and ditched the <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/63/Reign_superboy.jpg"">hideous nineties outfit</a> for a <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b7/Connerkent.png"">much simpler costume (and one that just about anybody could reproduce)</a>. He's since followed the example of the original Supes and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superboy_%28Kon-El%29#Infinite_Crisis"">died in battle</a>, but <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superboy_%28Kon-El%29#The_Cult_of_Conner"">he'll be back</a>. It's a comic book, after all.

The Man of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Irons"">Steel</a> had his own <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_%28film%29"">movie</a> later on, but let's try to forget that one. He's had a decent showing in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_animated_universe"">DC animated universe</a>, so you can go to that if comics aren't your bag (or, if you just want to see some really fun cartoons). Of all the ""Supermen"", John Henry Irons is perhaps the most visible, and has remained a constant and valued presence in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28comics%29"">Metropolis</a>, even if he's gone through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Irons#52"">some changes</a>.

As for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_Superman"">Man of Tomorrow</a>, the Cyborg Superman was one of two who actually claimed to be Superman <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_Superman#Reign_of_the_Supermen:_The_Man_of_Tomorrow"">returned from the grave</a>. That story didn't hold up for long, but he managed to do some real damage before he disappeared into comic book limbo.

I never quite got what was the deal with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradicator_%28comics%29"">Last Son of Krypton</a>, who turned out to be the Eradicator, a kryptonian android. Near as I can follow, he had even convinced himself that he was the real Superman, although that one also didn't last very long. Unfortunately, just thinking you're Superman isn't enough to <I>be</i> Superman, even if you have all his powers. Hyper-violent and grim, this ""Superman"" exemplified some of the worst qualities of nineties superheroes.

In the end, out of all the people who wore the shield after Superman's death, all the people who tried to live up to his example, the one who stayed most true was ultimately the one most folks forget about:

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibbo_Bibbowski""> <IMG src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/huperanthro/pic/0000813d"">
""Bibbo"" Bibbowski</a>.

While all the other costumed idiots were busy beating people (and each other) up, Bibbo went around handing out food to the homeless and rescuing drowning puppies. Which sounds more heroic?"

Which is part of why you need to read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Morrison"">Grant Morrison</a>'s run of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Man"">Animal Man</a>. Gifted with the power to duplicate any of the natural abilities of nearby animals (from elephants to bacteria) Buddy Baker's connection to the broader natural world steadily engenders a deeper moral conscience, beyond the vaguely defined sense of justice that so many superheroes are driven by. He speaks out for animal rights, tries to communicate with supervillains instead of simply attacking. This is not to say that he doesn't make bad decisions, but Morrison very deliberately shows the consequences of those actions. While rescuing lab animals from unecessary and cruel ""testing"", he allows a companion to set fire to the empty labs-- an action which is later shown to have resulted in severe injuries to firefighters who attempted to stop the blaze. Buddy struggles with being perceived as a role model, with the consequences of well-intentioned actions, and eventually his own nature as a fictional character.

But you shouldn't just read Animal Man because it touches on social and environmental issues in a sensible and appropriately cautious fashion, or because it discusses the nature of the author to their creations by having the them meet and talk it out. No, you should read it because of this:

-The introduction of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_%28comics%29"">Supernova</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Kane"">Batwoman</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis_%28DC_Comics%29"">Isis</a>. I really want to find out who the heck Supernova is (I'm hoping <I>not</i> Booster Gold from another timeline), Batwoman is interesting if a bit poorly designed; Isis is yet another of those superheroes who are named after (or channel the power of, or are supposed to be an incarnation of...) a deity from a polytheistic religion, which I tend to find to be really annoying for various reasons. However, the influence she's having on Black Adam is welcome.

-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra_Sandsmark"">Wonder Girl</a> joining a cult which promises the ressurection of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superboy_%28Kon-El%29"">Superboy</a>.

-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Adam"">Black Adam</a> forming <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Power_Treaty"">an international alliance to limit the activities of metahumans</a>, then mellowing out and turning his attentions towards becoming a better <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahndaq"">ruler</a>.
-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Men"">Mercury</a> being at least partially restored. The DCU needs characters as wacky as the Metal Men, even if things stay serious. It's the whole ""Emperor's New Clothes"" phenomenon- the best person to keep the authority figures on their toes is sometimes the one who acts the least respectable.

-The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Boosterdeath.PNG"">death</a> of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_Gold"">Booster Gold</a>. Took them long enough. Now, let's see how long it takes Skeets to destroy the world.

-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Irons"">Steel</A> being turned into, well... steel. Lex Luthor may be a a criminal and scientific mastermind, but he really needs someone else to write his jokes for him.

"event","I am not the sort to claim having been a fan of an artist or character since before they were popular, although I do feel some small shame in having only become aware of certain works within the past several years. Chief among these is what has come to be my favorite character, by one who has come to be one of my favorite artists and writers: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Mignola"">Mike Mignola</a>'s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellboy"">Hellboy</a>. 

For some time I have been reading the adventures of the big-armed demon, and had become quite enamored of Mignola's art and stories. Indeed, Mignola excels as an artist, and particularly as a character desginer (he has been credited with designing the very memorable <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Freeze#In_other_media"">animated version of Mr. Freeze</a>, whose appearance demonstrate Mignola's sense of design even when drawn in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Timm"">Bruce Timm</a>'s style). However, one rarely sees him solely as a writer.

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/huperanthro/pic/0000362s"">

<U>Hellboy: Makoma or, a Tale Told by a Mummy in the New York City Explorer's Club on August 16, 1993</U> is both a stellar example of Mignola's ability as a writer, and brilliant stand-alone comic that still fits into the broader Hellboy mythos. This is a story framed by Mignola's portrayal of Hellboy's visit to a private club on the lower east side, a place filled with just the sort of dimly lit and richly shadowed artefacts that are so wonderfully portrayed in this style. Particularly notable is the titular mummy, which leads Hellboy on a trance journey into a royal necropolis, where the great adventurer falls asleep, waking into the role of the hero in the mummy's tale.

Here is a subtle brilliance: one turns the page, and finds the hand of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Corben"">Richard Corben</a> illustrating Hellboy as Makoma. This change is more than a new artist stepping in, it is the signal that both Hellboy and the reader have entered the tale of Makoma. Those who have become close to Mike Mignola note his love of books, his home is as much a repository for tales as his own mind has proven. Drawing upon that wellspring of lore, he is a master of telling stories in the old way. Regardless of the national or ethnic origins of those who weave it with word and image; Makoma is not a story about Hellboy in Africa, it is an African story about Hellboy. Any fortunate child whose parents read them stories of Anansi or told them the folklore of the Yoruba may recognize the style, the manner and structure of this adventure. Most notable, I found, was Hellboy/Makoma's dialogue with a giant whose activities have made a terrible thunderous sound across the plains:

HELLBOY: ""HEY!""

GIANT, pausing as he lifts a stone: ""?""

HELLBOY: ""That you making all that noise?""

GIANT: ""I am Chi-eswa-mapiri, Builder of Mountains. Who are you, little man, that you dare speak to me?""

HELLBOY: ""Makoma.""

NARRATOR: The giant knew the meaning of that name and was enraged to hear it.

CHI-ESWA-MAPIRI: ""Gaah! He Who is Without Fear? You should have fear of ME!!""

A battle ensues, with the hero as the easy victor. He goes on after this to mee three more giants, each time giving his name, and each time this enrages the giant into attacking him and being made to surrender. Makoma encounters many other things in his journeys, from a fiery lizard-demon to a city of corpses. All of this is in the rich manner of the stories which are told through generations, which are told that they might not be forgotten.

<img src=""http://i105.photobucket.com/albums/m233/huperanthropology1/hbymak1p4.jpg"">

Indeed, it is memorable. To repeat the cries of the defeated giants who have begged for mercy- Makoma is great!"

"event","There's something I don't like about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman"">Wonder Woman</a>.

In <I>principle</I>, she's one of my favorite characters. A heroine with easily defined powers and some really neat gadgets, the concept works great. Even better, she's the first notable female supehero. You kind of have to like her if you're into the genre at all.

The problem is, she's only a favorite in principle. She works great conceptually, hell, Aquaman works great conceptually. But, like Aquaman, she's suffered from a long line of bad decisions behind the scenes. Despite DC's best efforts to promote her as one part of a trinity with Batman and Superman, she's still very removed from them in popularity and visibility.

Sure, everyone who knows superheroes knows about her. She's had a live-action <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_%28television_series%29"">TV show</a>, and she's been around for longer than many of her fans have been alive. Still, it always feels as though she doesn't have nearly the star power of other big name superheroes. Why is that? It's pretty simple, really:

She has no personality of her own.

Everyone knows Superman. He had some temper tantrums and got way too emo in the nineties, and then he had a midlife crisis and joined <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Superman_Blue.jpg"">Blue Man Group</a>, but pretty much everyone will describe him as the Good Guy. Superman's the hero who always does the Right Thing, just because he can. He's the shining example to all the other heroes. He's the Kents' boy, a nice kid who helps out with the farm work. Same goes for Batman, although it honestly hasn't always been that way: he's the one who does the dirty work but still stays above it, the champion of authority in an often very patriarchial way. He's brooding, a little too obsessed with justice, and has issues about his father, but he's ultimately a good guy. Batman's the one who acts as an example not of morality and ethics, but of dedication.

How can you sum up Wonder Woman like that? If you take all the different incarnations of her over the years and cut out the stuff that doesn't gel together, you wind up with something a little too simplistic: she's a strong woman, an Amazon in the literal and figurative sense (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons#Etymology"">except that she has both her breasts</a>). Don't agree? Well, here's the genesis of all this kvetching- a while back, I decided to create superheroes based on popular archetypes for my own stories, analogues of the more famous characters. Superman, Batman, Captain America-- easy enough --but when I got to Wonder Woman, I wound up creating two characters... then three, then four, and so on. In brief:
-I began with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Moulton_Marston"">WMM-era bondage heroine</a> who defeats her foes by causing them to willingly surrender, rather than just beating them up. I left out the bit where submitting to men deprived her of her powers.
-I just had to skip over the lovestruck <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse_%28DC_Comics%29"">Earth-Two</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman#Dr._Wertham_and_the_Silver_Age"">version</a> whose powers came from <I>male</i> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theos"">theoi</a>. She willingly gave up her powers and retired, anyway.
-The one based on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman#The_Diana_Prince_era_and_the_Bronze_Age"">Diana Prince</a>... hoo boy. A lot of people, then and now, have criticized the de-powering of Wonder Woman. Thing is, her comics had hit a long-running slump before that-- and the change (if only because there was a change) was more than enough to send sales skyrocketing. Yeah, there was some really awful writing, but for a while she had the personality she had been lacking for years. If the earlier versions were Wonder Woman with the emphasis on <I>Wonder</i>, this was putting the emphasis on <I>Woman</i>.
-I took a note both from the late 80s version and her portrayal in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League_%28animated_series%29"">DC animated universe</a> (and maybe a little bit of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Come_%28comic%29"">Kingdom Come</a>) for yet another superhero. This is Diana as the Princess of the Amazons, the confident leader who is in every way the equal of Superman and Batman, and in many ways their superior. She's what politicians wish they could be, or at least what they pretend to aspire to- a representative of her nation who is both a capable diplomat, able leader in wartime, and beloved liberator of the imperiled and mistreated. 
-I refuse any association with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Deodato"">Deodato's</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman#Post-Perez"">period</a> with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Messner-Loebs"">Messner-Loebs</a>. Taking a character revered as a feminist icon and turning her into a Barbie-waisted pinup. Potential and actual writers: look to this part of Wonder Woman's history as an example of how the wrong artist can utterly ruin your work.
-I don't like what they've done with Wonder Woman <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman#Infinite_Crisis"">lately</a>, either, but that doesn't mean I can't take something from it. Even if most of the people in the DC universe don't, I do recognize that she had to do what she did. However, I do also recognize that it shouldn't have led to that, the directions the story took to lead up to a heroine-- who was originally conceived of as defeating villains by making them to surrender --brutally killed a super-powered murderer. Of course, sometimes you have to write a character you don't like to advance the story... that's where my version of this incarnation comes in.

Of course, all that doesn't count the times the role of Wonder Woman fell to others: former ""Wonder Girl"" Donna Troy, Diana's own mother Hippolyta, a crazy redhead, or whatever other amazon feels like girding her loins with a field of blue emblazoned with stars*. It certainly doesn't factor in her numerous appearances in other media or alternate universes.

What's the solution? Ideally, a way to create a coherent whole from these disparate parts could be found. But, that's up to the writers, and the writers are up to the people in charge. Hopefully, they'll realize they've got something even more precious hidden under all those years of golden lariats and bulletproof bracelets.

"event","Some of the contents of this post may offend you or those within sight of the screen. There's talk of breasts, and links to non-erotic illustrations of women whose bra cup sizes exceed D*. <lj-cut text=""If you can't handle that kind of thing , consider this fair warning."">

Many attacks have been made on the artistic merits of the comics form throughout it's brief history, and a signifigant number of these have been directed at superhero comics. A frequently heard one is of the seemingly weightless bosoms of many a comic book heroine, an artistic convention perhaps most frequently mocked by those within the comics industry. From intentional satire to jocular <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Girl"">tests of just how far an artist could stretch the boundaries of believability</a>, heroines and superheroines with breasts that are quite literally unbelievably perky and unusually large bosoms grew to be a standard of comic book art. The most graphic <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_girl_art"">examples</a> come from the previously mentioned <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Age_of_Comic_Books"">Modern Age of comics</a>, often featuring <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chastity_%28comic_book%29"">women whose bodies were so outlandish</a> that it might be questioned whether the artist had ever <I>seen</i> a real woman's breast.

Of course, comics don't last long if nobody is reading them, and part of selling an illustrated medium is making it visually appealing. Making overtures to the audience's sex drive is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_girl_art"">tried and true practice</a>, and although it won't win any accolades from feminist organizations (nor most arts-focused groups), it does earn you a few pennies.

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Plunderer"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i105.photobucket.com/albums/m233/huperanthropology1/PennyPlunderer28Kane29.jpg"" border=""0""></a>

Not that money is the sole motivation for such designs: the first things artists draw are what those artists like, and a few of them even get hired to keep doing it. For many of the artists who draw them (as well as the people who hire those artists), these impossible figures are attractive, even ideal. Even more muscular female characters like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman"">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Hulk"">She-Hulk</a> have been drawn in such fashions, although Shulkie's figure tends to change from tall and slender to broad and bulky with every new artist. The big problem is, this ignores that breasts are mostly fatty tissue, and women with the sort of bodybuilder physique of stronger superheroes tend to be fairly flat chested; rendering such portrayals not only potentially sexist, but physiologically absurd.

It happens that I fancy myself a forward-thinking individual who desires equality for all genders, as well as someone who likes to see a realistically broad range of physiques in comics. I'm also someone who is attracted to large breasts, and who had family members whose business was  related to adult entertainment. I can't rationalize it much, and sometimes I feel that I have to apologize for it, but here's the thing: I like them <I>realistic</I>. Realistic large breasts don't sit still while support by slender thongs of leather or whatever latest bizarre costume design is exposing two thirds or more of mammary flesh- even smaller breasts tend not to do that, in reality. We are, after all, talking about what is basically a mass of fatty tissue supported from only one side, affected by gravity as any other object would be. Barring surgery, breasts tend not to sit like fleshy balloons upon the chest, and, honestly? I find it more attractive when they don't.

<a href=""http://pablowapsi.livejournal.com/"">Paul Taylor</a> seems to realize this.

Paul, artist and author of <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/index.html"">Wapsi Square</a>, which means he created <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/monica.html"">Monica Villareal</a>. Monica is petite, cute, smart, and outgoing. She also has an obviously large pair of breasts on her otherwise small frame. Unlike many artists, Taylor makes certain that this is discussed when it's relevant. Early on, he shows the differences and difficulties Monica faces in everyday life: <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20011026.html"">how hard it is to find proper support</a> in larger size bras, <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20011112.html"">the ignorance of most people about the sizing of bras</a>, <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20011114.html"">the expense</a> faced by those who have to get their underwear from <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20040723.html"">specialty stores</a>. He even provides <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/faq.html"">a bit of advice for readers with the same problems as his star</a>. Yeah, he has a little fun with it where he can-- it's a <I>comic</i> strip, after all --but he recognizes that like just about any human quality, there's ups and <a hrefe=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20040727.html"">downs</a> (although hopefully not too many, if you get a good sports bra).

Paul Taylor also gets something else right: he doesn't fill his cast with just one body type, and he makes it clear that every last one (well, Tepoz is <I>cute</I>, but...) is attractive in their own way. In the Wapsi world, <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/jacquline.html"">pale, freckled and ginger-haired</a> is <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20040909.html"">just as sexy</a> as <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/lakshmi.html"">tall, tan, and muscular</a> is <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20040604.html"">beautiful</a>. The <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20041018.html"">male characters are just <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20030602.html"">as attractive</a>, something unfortunately rare in art by heterosexual men. Characters are aware of their attributes, <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20050810.html"">bad</a> and <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20050811.html"">good</a>, and <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20030616.html"">nobody</a> is <a href=""http://www.wapsisquare.com/d/20030618.html"">perfect</a>.

Body image in comics is a long story. The short version is: you should be reading Wapsi Square.

The Justice Society of America.

Created in 1940, partly as a method of showcasing superheroes who did not have a starring role in any other monthly comics, it was the original superhero team. Composed of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hourman"">Hourman</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandman_%28Wesley_Dodds%29"">the Sandman</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_%28comics%29"">the Specter</a>, the original <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pratt_%28comics%29"">Atom</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Garrick"">the Flash</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Scott"">Green Lantern, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Hall_%28comics%29"">Hawkman</a>, the team grew and changed over the years. This was true even in its early days, as the Flash and Green Lantern would soon leave, replaced by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Thunder"">Johnny Thunder and his Thunderbolt</a>; while  the Specter was only a nominal presence in the stories. Other early members would come to include <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Mid-Nite"">Doctor Mid-Nite</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starman_%28DC_Comics_Golden_Age%29"">Starman</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Terrific_%28comics%29#Terry_Sloane"">Mister Terrific</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat_%28comics%29"">Wildcat</a>.

As time passed and the JSA fell back from the spotlight, replaced by the more popular characters of the Justice <I>League</I> of America, these heroes nevertheless remained important to the history of the DC Universe. 

<B>Hourman</B> Rex Tyler, like many other characters, would in time pass on his name to younger heroes, including his own son, Rick. However, I will always remember these heroes for how amazing the costume design is: the grim executioner's hood, fearsome even in yellow, combined with the hourglass clasp on his cloak. It sends a very clear message to criminals: time's up.

The <B>Sandman</B>'s moniker would later be applied by author <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman"">Neil Gaiman</a> to an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_%28DC_Comics/Vertigo%29"">entity also known as Dream</a>, or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_%28comics%29"">Morpheus</a>; stories that would go on to draw in previously untapped audiences into the world of comics and graphic novels, and which continue to be the most recognizable symbol of Mr. Gaiman's talents.

Al Pratt's role as <B>the Atom</b> is remembered less for contributing to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atom#Silver_Age_Atom_.28Ray_Palmer.29"">the name of a very different line of heroes</a>, but rather for his more personal contributions to the superhero population. Father of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damage_%28comics%29"">Damage</a> and godfather to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_Smasher"">, Pratt's tenacity was an inspiration both for the message that you don't need to be of heroic stature to be a hero, and for the legacy he has inspired.

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Garrick"">Jay Garrick</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Scott"">Alan Scott</a> were the original <B>Flash</B> and <B>Green Lantern</b>. The model they have served as for younger heroes is admirable, but even more so is the fact that they have remained as heroes throughout that time. Few things are more delightful than seeing the senior speedster running at impossible speeds, and indeed the fact that he is currently the <I>only</i> Flash makes him all the more remarkable. Meanwhile, Scott's dedication is no less admirable. Having lost both his own eyes (each was replaced in a different manner) and his daughter <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_%28comics%29"">Jade</a> within the past two years, he has continued to act in a heroic fashion where others would understandably seek time to themselves. 

As for <B>Hawkman</B>, what more can be said of his courage and bravery than that he has no problem wearing that costume in public?

<B>Johnny Thunder</b> may not be recognizable to most casual readers, but his heir should be; if he's not, you need to get to know <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakeem_Thunder"">Jakeem Thunder</a>. Arrogant, rude, foul-mouthed, and vengeful- Jakeem doesn't exactly come off as the most heroic member of the JSA. However, actions are often the truest mark of a hero: Jakeem is loyal to his friends, going to impossible lengths to help them, even when the powers of his Thunderbolt ""genie"" might be absent. Indeed, the Thunderbolt is one of Jakeem's friends, a partner rather than a servant or familiar.

As <B>Dr. Mid-Nite</B>, Charles McNider beat Daredevil to the punch by being the first ""blind"" superhero, and he did a better job of it in my opinion. Able to somehow see in the dark while blind in light, he plunged villains into darkness. Although the original died some time ago, the heir to his identity-- Dr. Pieter Cross --has proved his worth both as a superhero and as a skilled medical professional. Specializing in his fellow superheroes, although Doctor Mid-Nite saves lives more often through medicine than darkness-creating technology, he remains a <I>super</i>hero. Plus, he's a vegetarian with an owl for a sidekick.

<B>Starman</B>'s legacy is as long as any other hero's, if not even more so. No less than ten people, including Ted Knight himself, have used the name; these have included his son, whose gravity-manipulating Cosmic Staff has been passed onto <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargirl"">Stargirl</a>.

<B>Mister Terrific</B> was Terry Sloane, ""the Man of 1000 Talents"". A super-genius and olympian-level athlete, his good nature was exemplified by his wearing of the motto ""Fair Play"". He's dead now, but the example he provided has inspired a new Mister Terrific, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Terrific_%28Michael_Holt%29"">Michael Holt</a>.

Ted Grant, or <B>Wildcat</B> to most folks, is doubly important. First, he is an amazingly skilled fighter who has singlehandedly defeated no less than seven supervillains at once, and with the use of only one of his arms and no powers of his own. Second, he's the one who taught Batman to box, and Bruce never really learned everything Ted had to teach him.

Whoops, forgot to mention <B>Red Tornado</B>. Well, there's a reason: ""Ma"" Hunkel wasn't an official member of the JSA, even though she came to meetings and was there at the founding of the group The archetypal eccentric in long underwear and a cape, Ma was a satirical character whose well-intentioned adventuring did indeed achieve the goal of stopping crime, although the manner of her victories was more consistently comedic than dramatic. Often mistaken for a male superhero due to her brawny physique and steel pot helmet, Ma went the way of most of DC's funny characters for a great many years. An android would eventually take up the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Tornado"">Red Tornado</a> identity, at first mistakenly believing itself to be the original; this entity would be destroyed in the same event that took Alan Scott's eyes.

Some of these people are easy to see in the above pciture, an upcoming cover displaying the new Justice Society of America, others are the latest heirs to a given hero's legacy. Seated around the table, clockwise from the bottom left of the picture:
-Jakeem Thunder
-the new Sandman, formerly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_%28comics%29"">Sandy the Golden Boy</a>, and later simply Sand
-Mister Terrific
-the Flash
-Hawkman
-Doctor Mid-Nite
-Green Lantern Alan Scott
-Hourman
-And Stargirl on the table

<I>Not</I> seated are, clockwise from Stargirl:
-the new Starman, an unknown figure
-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Girl"">Power Girl</a>, Superman's cousin from an alternate universe which no longer exists
-Either Nuklon, or more likely Damage in a new costume
-the new Red Tornado
-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_%28comics%29"">Obsidian</a>: Alan Scott's son, who seems to have his control over darkness back
-Wildcat
-the new <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Belle_%28comics%29"">Liberty Belle</a>
-and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Steel"">Commander Steel</a>, icon of American industry

I love the diversity here. You've got characters young and old, rebellious and conformist, radical and conservative, gay and straight. The new Justice society is even more of what it once was: a family. A family of crazy people who fly around fighting crime and make horrible fashion decisions, but a family. They don't get along at times, but there's a history there that they can't deny, and any one of them would sacrifice their own well being for the others if need be."

"event","Sorry for the lack of updates lately, things have been kind of busier than expected. That said, I've got a bit of a treat to make up for it all...

Every now and again, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercompany_crossover"">comics publishers come together on an idea</a>, and let the public see characters-- most often superheroes --that ordinarily wouldn't even be aware of each other's existence come together. Most of the time, this can amount to one of three things: 
-a battle between the characters, such as the Incredible Hulk vs Superman or Batman
-the characters unite to face a larger threat, often a combined force of villains from either universe
-or some mixture of the above
The first happens more often than you'd think would be sensible. These are supposed to be the good guys, after all. However, a lot of these crossovers happened during the late eighties and nineties, a time when comics became progressively grimmer and grittier in an attempt to win sales. It was a time of big muscles and bigger guns, a hyperviolent era some know as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Age_of_Comic_Books"">the Dark Age of Comic Books</a> (a sarcastic parody of the convention of naming earlier periods in comics by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_Man"">the standards of Hesiod and Ovid</a>). Consequently, even famously good-natured heroes like Superman and Spiderman were written as increasingly short-tempered, fraught with enough failings and issues to make a psychiatrist take some vacation time. The simple confusion of being place in another world, and encountering characters that were often understood to be fictional in each hero's respective world, was many times considered to be enough to begin a brawl that could topple skyscrapers.

In the midst of all this came a crossover that many still cannot believe actually occured. In fact, not only did it truly occur, but both publishers involved put out their own seperate covers for the same content, perhaps to see which would sell more copies in the end. It was a spectacle, a 48-page abomination that would never have occured had it not been for someone's twisted sense of humour. I'm glad I found my copy of:

<U><B>Archie Meets the Punisher</b></u>

Written by <a href=""http://www.exhibitapress.com/pages/batton.html"">Batton Lash</a> (who is both a capable author and illustrator), the art was credited to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Buscema"">John Buscema</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Goldberg"">Stan Goldberg</a>, each one drawing in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Punisher"">Punisher</a> characters and residents of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverdale_%28Archie_Comics%29"">Riverdale</a> as was suited to their skills. I don't need to go too deeply into a summary, since some kind folks have put it all <a href=""http://www.techknight.com/gallery/punisherarchie"">online for you to read</a>, but I'll share an observation or two:

Archie sweating bullets while Frank shoves an uzi up his cartoonish little nose may be the single best panel I've seen in comics in a long time. That the next two pages feature <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jughead_Jones"">Jughead outwitting the Punisher</a>*, or that a later scene shows <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Grundy"">Ms. Grundy</a> putting the moves on an incognito Punisher? That makes this book <I>priceless</i>.

*Yes, intercompany crossovers often featured victories that made little sense, and which only worked within some very contrived parameters. Such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman"">Aquaman hitting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namor"">Namor</a> with an orca**, or a teenager whose diet consists mainly of hamburgers outwitting a trained killing machine by tossing a rock in the opposite direction. Because, as we all know, hardened mercenaries fall for the same tricks as Scooby Doo monsters, and the first published <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_%28fictional%29#Marvel_Comics"">mutant</a>-- who can withstand the pressures of the deepest ocean depths, capable of lifting over a hundred tons --can be held down by a six ton animal with no limbs.

**No, not <I>that</i> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca_%28comics%29"">Orca</a>. Although, it would probably have been more believable..."

<img src=""http://i105.photobucket.com/albums/m233/huperanthropology1/Narbonic.jpg"">
Someday, I expect (or at least hope) that I'll be asked to write some words about the first time I <a href=""http://www.narbonic.com/"">read something </a>by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaenon_K._Garrity"">Shaenon Garrity</a>. Most likely, I'll be one of a great many contributors; most likely, I'll be making the bulk of it up. My memory is notoriously poor, save for certain nerdish details, but there will be some truth to what I write. That truth is as follows: 

Shaenon K Garrity <I>knows how to tell a story</i>. A great many people know how to pass along information through art or writing, some are capable enough to do both. A surprising amount are even fairly good at it. Eventually, they might even write and/or draw a story. However, there's a different art to <I>telling</i> a story. 

When you tell a story, you suit it to your audience. If you're telling a story to geeks and nerds, you tell a story where <I>of course</i> <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9765"">decaf coffee is evil</a>. You tell a story where something is terribly amiss when a character <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=10337"">wants to sell all his old toys</a>*. You tell a story where <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9966"">RNA samples might code a buggy version</a> of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork"">Zork</a>*.

When you tell a story, you repeat themes. There is, of course, a big difference between doing this purposefully and doing this lazily. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield"">Garfield </a><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield#Themes_and_settings"">does it lazily</a>, Garfield was intentionally created to do it lazily. When Shaenon, for example, establishes that each <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9842&mpe=1&step=1"">character</a> <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9842&mpe=1&fromwhich=1&direction=f"">has</a> <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9842&mpe=1&fromwhich=2&direction=f"">their</a> <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9842&mpe=1&fromwhich=3&direction=f"">own</a> bevy of ""shoulder angels"" representing different aspects of their personality, it's more than just a <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9792"">comedic device </a>or convenient tool for looking into someone's deeper thoughts; it's a way of pointing out a deep and profound <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=10983&name=narbonic#strip4"">change in a character</a>*. When Shaenon establishes outside of the main storyline that there were <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9791&mpe=1&step=1"">identical</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era"">Victorian era</a> <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9791&mpe=1&step=1"">analogues</a> to the regular cast, she finds <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9867&name=narbonic"">a way to have them meet the modern cast</a>*.

Such repeated inclusion of themes, each instance more meaningful than the last, serves multiple purposes. On a basic level, it helps others remember the story. This is important for those who pass on stories in an oral tradition, but also those who hope to establish a fanbase. On a deeper level, it helps connect the audience with the story. Input from the audience has long guided the direction stories take, whether subtly or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_A_Death_in_the_Family"">profoundly</a>; however, there are limits to how much you can let an audience have control and still tell a good story. Repetition lets the audience feel involved without actually controlling the direction of the story, because it gives them the <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9807&mpe=1&step=1""><b>""a-ha"" moment</b></a>. The <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9899"">""a-ha"" moment</a> is the point in a story when the audience member realizes that <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=10002"">something which was said</a> or <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=10106"">shown</a> a relatively long time ago <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=10210"">contains clues</a> to the future <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=10316"" title=""down"">direction</a> of the story. The ""a-ha"" moment not only gives the audience a more profound connection to the story, it makes them feel smarter. Shaenon K. Garrity is incredibly skilled at creating such moments.

I'm not sure what initially hooked me on Narbonic. Back when I started reading it, it was on the <a href=""http://www.moderntales.com/"">Modern Tales</a> subscription site, and was one of the primary reasons I chose to subscribe in the first place. It may have been that when mad science <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9895"">transforms one of the characters from male to female</a>, he <I>doesn't</i> have a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranma_%C2%BD"">pert</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wotch"">curvaceous</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futaba-Kun_Change%21"">slim</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Goonish_Shive#Ellen"">sexual</a> body (not that you should ignore those other comics, of course). It may have been that <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9770"">Helen's nemesis Dave Barker</a> also happens to be a real person. It may even have been that I just love the idea of a comic where the most prominent heroic character is a <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9769"">forensic linguist</a>.

Actually, it was probably the idea of <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&chapter=9909"">a global conspiracy of guys named Dave</a>.

Narbonic is almost over. It was begun with the full intent of having an ending, like all good storytellers, Shaenon knows where to end the story. This is not to say there won't be more from her: the college/superhero series <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/smithson/series.php"" title=""how can you not love a hero in a miner's helmet?"">Smithson</a> and <a href=""http://www.girlamatic.com/comics/mell.php"" title=""worth the cost of subscription, I promise"">Li'l and Sergio</a> (a Narbonic prequel) are a long way from completion, her surreal work <a href=""http://www.webcomicsnation.com/tomhart/trunktownarchive/series.php?view=archive&chapter=5006"">Trunktown</a>-- with art from the <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,1018964,00.html"">critically-acclaimed</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hart"">Tom Hart</a> --is also available for free, and she's written for <a href=""http://media.comics.ign.com/media/781/781373/img_3203905.html"">Marvel</a>.

I expect to be asked to write about Shaenon because I expect great things from her; I expect great things from her because <B>she's already done so many</B>."

<B>Creative Summary</b>
I do not mean to sound fannish when I say that every individual who contributed to this book is a leader in their field:
-<B>Todd Klein</B>, a champion in an area of comics creation that rarely receives attention even within the industry media, is an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_Awards#Best_Letterer.2FLettering"">award-winning</a> letterer. If you happen to click that last link, your eyes are not fooling you; he did indeed win every year but 1996 since the creation of the award category.
-So much can be said about <B>Alan Moore</B>; a man whose acclaimed graphic novels have been made into several unfortunately less than acclaimed films, whose experiences with Hollywood were so unpleasant that he requested his name be removed from future publications of any works which he himself did not own the rights to. Visibly eccentric, Moore has penned works which are-- while violent, grim, and often having sexual themes --visibly distinct from the works of other creators who are criticized for having similar themes. Perhaps it is in the way Moore displays those themes. Violence is presented as unpleasant, something horrific; sexual content is more often erotic than pornographic, and includes a diverse range of sexualities.
-<B>Gene Ha</B> has worked with Moore in the past, and their pairing evokes the superhero team-ups of the past. In concert with other artists, he lends a unique appearance to the worlds of Top 10, both past and present. More realistic than the designs of other creators, Ha's characters have easily recognizable features from their teeth to their toes. Perfect heroic physiques are often the exception rather than the rule, his more human character designs ultimately make for more belivable <I>super</i>humans.
-Just as Gene Ha has often worked with Moore, so too has <B>Art Lyon</B> won recognition for his work with Ha. Lyon (along with his wife, <a href=""http://artlyon.com/the_ART_gallery/recent_comic_book_work/recent_comic_book_work.html"">Ellen</a>) lends a muted palette to the world of the Forty-Niners, reflecting both that the book is set in the past, and the muted character of the post-war life of wartime superheroes.

<B>Story Summary</B>
A prequel to Moore and Ha's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_10_%28comic%29""><U>Top 10</U></a> series, the Forty-Niners presents the dawn of the city of Neopolis. The year is 1949 in a world where super-powered <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_hero"">science heroes</a> contributed in combat on either side, only to have found themselves less than welcome back home. Though they are not met with the venom that later veterans of Vietnam received, the incredible abilities of these <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersoldier"">super-soldiers</a> make their potential neighbors more than a little uncomfortable. Thus, the experimental city of Neopolis is realized: a fantastic metropolis which benefits from the same science that its new residents do, the surrounding architecture evocative of both the expected norms of the era, as well as the seemingly impossible designs of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titans_Tower"">superhero headquarters</a> past and present. Crowd scenes often include caricatures of familiar comics heroes and villains  of the period: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Tracy"">Dick Tracy</a> foes <a href=""http://www.comicspage.com/dicktracy/dick_villain6.html"">Momma & the Midget</a> are plainly visible in a later interior shot of the Neopolis Central train station, in full view of  Captain Orval (the Superman pastiche <B>Doctor Omega</B>) and Officer Chambers, AKA <B>Steelgauntlet</B>. More familiar faces to modern readers appear as well- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Marvel_%28DC_Comics%29"">Billy Batson</a> and  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Olsen#The_many_transformations_of_Jimmy_Olsen"">Elastic Lad</a> are visible among a crowd of reporters which also includes <B>Larry ""The Newshound"" Lomax</B>, who might be more familiar to readers of the other Top 10 books. These cameos are one of the hallmarks of the series as a whole, which have included such diverse characters as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG-1"">SG1</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laughing_Cow"">the Laughing Cow</a>.

It is into the confusion and commotion of this new city that former soldiers Steven Traynor and Leni Muller arrive; amidst both other former heroes, and minorities of robots (the opressed ""clickers""), a vampire mafia, and the earlier residents of the city. Steven, formerly the  high-flying <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy"">prodigy</a> <b>Jetlad</b>, is still a wide-eyed youth not yet old enough to drink. His friend Leni (<I>die Lufthexe</i>, <B>the Skywitch</B>, for her ""broomstick"" flying machine) is set up as both a more mature guide and her own character. Having left the German forces in 1943, Leni's background allows her greater access to other former Nazi supersoldiers and scientists, many of whom have been invited to contribute to Neopolis despite their past crimes.

Familiar heroic archetypes exist in Neopolis- Jetlad (boy hero), the <B><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackhawk_%28comics%29"">Skysharks</a></B> group of aviatiors, the mad scientist <B>Professor Gromolko</B>, and far more. Moore demonstrates his rich knowledge of the comics world on every page, while at the same time poking fun at its conventions. Both an arrestee and an officer of the Neopolis PD are advised to tone down mention of their sidekicks in the face of child endangerment laws, while Officer Morales (a former horse-riding hero, <B>the Black Rider</B>, now an avid motorcyclist) suggests that the hero-sidekick relationship is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Wertham#Seduction_of_the_Innocent_and_Senate_hearings"">something less innocent</a>. 

Despite (or, indeed, perhaps partly due to) characters on either side of the law who demonstrate the insensitivity and bigotry which was all too common at the time, this is a story which will appeal to many audiences who have felt they could find few familiar faces in comics.  Moore's easy handling of homosexuality shines in this story, one of the few comics published in the mainstream which features a relationship between two men as a vital element of the story. Meanwhile, the stories of the Neopolis Police also carry a hint of familiarity, from those who feel they must ""pass"" in order to avoid oppression to the discomforting remarks of flag-clad Officer Pure. The Forty-Niners is a story that shines for both the believability of its characters, and their ties to familiar archetypes of fiction."

"event","In the premiere of <a href=""http://www.scifi.com/superhero/"">Who Wants to be a Superhero?</A>, the new <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci_Fi_Channel_%28United_States%29"">Sci-Fi Channel</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television"">reality television</a> series, the viewer is presented with the mastermind: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee"">Stan Lee</a>. Stan is co-creator of what may currently be the world's most recognized superhero, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Spider-Man"">Spider-Man</a>; as well as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_%28comics%29"">Avengers</a>, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Men"">X-Men</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_%28Marvel_Comics%29"">Daredevil</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four"">the Fantastic Four</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silver_Surfer"">the Silver Surfer</a>. Although several of his most notable creations have been tales of teams of superheroes, he also has won acclaim and industry-wide recognition for his work on solo titles. 

Thus, it is from behind a massive video screen-- like an elderly version of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdman_and_the_Galaxy_Trio"">Birdman's</a> ally Falcon 7 (or any number of masterminds both heroic and villainous) --that he begins the process of choosing from among the great many mortals who have answered the call to prove themselves worthy of being called a superhero. On the line is the chance to star in a new comic book featuring the character they have devised, as well as fame and recognition that they had enough <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chutzpah"">chutzpah</a></i> to run around in public wearing spandex and plastic body armor.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i105.photobucket.com/albums/m233/huperanthropology1/Who_Wants_to_be_a_Superhero.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

The contestants appear before Stan from among numbers so vast one might mistake the auditions for a major comics convention. Costumes range from the comical to the complex, from folks in regular clothing to what I suspect were some very talented <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fursuiting"">fursuiters</a>. Stan asks them, one at a time, to give their name and a possible catch-phrase. Among these are:
 
-Slimeball: or, as he says ""It's Slimeball, baby. Slimeball"", a green-toned fellow with a cocksure stance.
-Insane Man: dressed in ragged though somewhat ordinary clothing, he yells out his name with an sustained intensity that would make him the envy of many a professional singer.
-unnamed bouncing hero: a fellow sealed in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepto_Bismol"">pepto bismol</a>-pink balloon, he declares his intent to bounce towards the villains, then proceeds to slowly and with some effort hop a few feet stage right. Sorry, chum; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncing_Boy"">Bouncing Boy </a> did it better, and he at least had visible arms.
-unnamed topless woman: Attempts to pass off distraction as a superpower. Stan seemed to like it, he is fond of bringing it up in interviews about the show. What I want to know is, what if she has to battle a hetero villainess; or even <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creote"">Creote and Savante</a> (or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsieur_Mallah"">Monsieur Mallah and the Brain</a>, or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_and_Saber"">Cannon and Saber</a>)? For that matter, why are so many of the loving gay couples in comics villains? I know it's not implied that it's part of their villainy, but still...

While these failed to make the initial cut, twelve others are called to gather at a secret location. A bit of a disappointment, I would have liked to have seen more of the rejects; not that there aren't a few among this motley cast:

-<a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#levity"">Levity</a> is the first to arrive at the site, a secluded mansion that must belong to some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_comics"">Marvel</a> exec or industry pal of Stan. The place seems right out of the Avengers, and Levity likes the way it looks. Right away, I found this fellow appealing; he described himself as wanting to be a role model as a gay superhero. However, his casual commentary with the others betrays an interest in making a profit off of appearing on television in his regular work as a creator of customized action figures.
-Arriving second is Rotiart. He looks a little weighed down in his costume, a grey ensemble with various dangling bits, including his codename emblazoned upon the chest. He greets Levity, and makes with the small talk as they await the next arrivals (I'll admit, here's where my memory of the order of arrival breaks down).
-A self-described <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_foodism"">raw foodist</a>, <a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#creature"">Creature</a>'s dietary choices didn't make enough of a good impression on me, I found her sense of style unpleasant and hard to watch. However, I did find the decision to include her an interesting one: superheroes with special diets are uncommon, aside from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_Manhunter"">Martian Manhunter</a>'s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo"">Oreo</a> addiction.
-<a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#fatmomma"">Fat Momma</a>, a rubenesque black woman who carries snacks on her belt, she presented her own theme song in place of a catch-phrase during the initial audition. Creature comments that she found her likeable, but worried about how good a role model she might be for youngsters who need to ""love their body"".
-<a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#majorvictory"">Major Victory</a> has retro style, he comes off like something out of the era of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics_Code"">Comics Code</a>. Jovial, a natural at posing, and very outgoing. He even has a shameful past: he wants to make up for when his work as an exotic dancer alienated his kid. Creature and I both noticed; he's still got the body. What would Doctor <a hreef=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Wertham"">Werthram</a> think?
-<a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#ironenforcer"">The Iron Enforcer</a> is pretty much Victory's opposite in the group. A grotesquely muscular man with a faux-cyborg arm and massive gun (which doesn't actually seem to weigh all that much, judging by how casually he  carries it around), he reflects the worst of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Age_of_Comic_Books"">Dark Age of Comics</a>. He admits to a desire to kill villains, and describes his powers in terms of their lethality. However, there seems to be a bit more to him, If you glance at his lone earring: do I spy a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chai_%28symbol%29"">Chai</a>?
-I don't like <a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#cellphonegirl"">Cell Phone Girl</a>. This is mainly because I don't like cellphones very much, but also because her costume includes the same black-and-pink stylings that Creature is so foolish to wear. Granted, so does Fat Momma, but at least she's using those colors to get a little coverage. I guess there's some truth to the costume designs some artists use for superheroines... some folks are more concerned about looking good than looking heroic.
-<a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#nitrog"">Nitro-G</a> makes a big deal out of his smaller stature, trying to come off as the quick little guy. I don't like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Allen#Kid_Flash"">Kid Flash</a>, I don't think I'll like this guy.
-<a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#lemuria"">Lemuria</a> has the notable honor of being chosen from among three women in the initial audition whose fate was left up to the internet- people voted, and she came out on top. A multilingual artist, she's scholarly and creative. She's got the sort of looks that win the fanboys; not my type, but she has other attractive qualities.
-I have no idea what to make of <a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#tyveculus"">Ty'veculus</a>. His costume looks like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto_%28comics%29"">Magneto</a> (or maybe <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boba_Fett"">Boba Fett</a>) broke onto the set of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_%28film%29"">Gladiator</a>. Someone call <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwayne_McDuffie"">Dwayne McDuffie</a>, we've got a black superhero in bad need of a better costume and some character!
-<a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#monkeywoman"">Monkey Woman</a>. I adore Monkey Woman. Monkey Woman reminds me of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel_Girl"">Squirrel Girl</a>, except she probably doesn't taste like hazlenuts. However, she doesn't seem to know how to act according to her professed character, as we see later on.
-<a href=""http://www.whowantstobeasuperhero.tv/cast/#feedback"">Feedback</a> was the last arrival, and unimpressive. I'm hoping he makes his mark later on, he just sort of faded into the background here.

The group has a bit of a party, where we get to see the Iron Enforcer dance. Stan shows up on a nearby video screen, and doesn't like what he sees; he yells at the contestants and suggests they act more like superheroes. What, like Spider-Man doesn't get down and funky?

Stan tells the group that they're going to the <I>real</i> home base, their own ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcave"">batcave</a>"". They express disappointment at leaving the mansion, this quickly turns into concern as the stretch <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummer"">Hummer</a> carrying them arrives in a signifigantly less affluent-looking urban area. They arrive in an alleyway, and are greeted by another screen, as well as a surprise: Stan says they're a spy in their group, who's been recording them so that Stan can cut out a member of the group before they even enter their new home! Can you guess who it was? The contestants get suspicious, and start pointing fingers, before Rotiart steps up to Stan and reports in. He explains, pulling the name off his chest to reveal his true identity- Rotiart is Traitor backwards. Boy, Stan; having the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Skull"">Red Skull</a> disguise himself as Dell Rusk was too complicated for you, I suppose? Can we get an anagram, at least?

Stan and ""Traitor"" display the video that the built-in cameras on the Rotiart costume collected, demonstrating unheroic flaws of three contestants:
-Levity commits the sin of <B>greed</B>, apparently Stan isn't a fan of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_Gold"">Booster Gold</a>. Wanting to make a profit off of making toys of yourself by hand is apparently a pretty big flaw.
-Iron Enforcer gets an earful for being <B>violent</b>, I'm guessing Stan never liked the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Punisher"">Punisher</a>? Sorry, Frank.
-Creature is criticized for being <B>lustful</B>- she comes on to Major Victory in the initial meeting, only to openly leer at Ty'Veculus as soon as he steps through the door.
Apparently <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante%27s_Inferno#The_Circles_of_Hell"">Dante </a> and Mr. Lee are in disagreement on this one, because Stan claims that Levity's greed is inappropriate, and he's the first to go. The others are supportive, hugging their fellow contestant and patting him on the back as Stan barks out that Levity needs to turn in his costume. Dumping his wristbands into a nearby trashcan, Levity departs.

The remaining group makes their way upstairs, passing through the back rooms of some sort of business, and riding up a seemingly ancient and ill-constructed elevator to their new home base. While it's not as superheroic as I would have liked, it's appropriate for a reality show. Each contestant has their own small, color-coded and labled sleeping space; but there's no time for rest just yet. Stan invites them to dinner, where he explains the nature of how they will be tested. Simply put, it's their superhuman virtues, not any particular power, which will determine who is eliminated. Courage, compassion, intelligence. Stan warns that the tests may not be what they seem, the first will take place the next day.

It's a pretty straightforward task: the contestants are in their street clothes, and must find somewhere to change into their costumes without being noticed, then race to the finish line. They're being timed, but they have to be careful to not be noticed by anyone other than the cameras. They begin heading out one at a time, each as Stan calls out their codename. Ty'Veculus and Monkey Woman are the most creative in finding a place to hide: Ty excuses himself into a nearby portable toilet to change; while Monkey Woman stays in-character and ascends to the top of a tree to strip down to her fuzzy bikini and bananas. Sure, she's not necessarily out of site among the leaves and branches, but it's a quick change, and I applaud her for staying in character on that point.

Each contestant makes their way to the designated end as quickly as they can, but wait-- there's a crying girl at a statue just before the finish line, calling for her mother and asking for help. Of course, these are ordinary people: most of them fail to even glance at the child, and Monkey Woman (who is explicitly described in promotional materials as wanting to help children, oddly enough) even seems to look right through the poor kid. Only Major Victory (the nice guy), Lemuria, Fat Momma (a mother herself), and Cell Phone Girl stop to escort her to a nearby park security station; the first two even lift the kid up and carry her to safety. Returning to the base, Stan asks the group to the roof: elimination time.

No real surprise here for the viewers, Stan reveals that the girl was a plant intended to enact the true test: compassion. He's plainly disgusted with the contestants who failed to notice the girl, including Monkey Woman, who he was almost positive actually saw the child and chose to ignore her. She is asked to step forward onto a lit square, along with Iron Enforcer and Nitro-G. More than just displeased with the other two for ignoring the girl, Stan again attacks Iron Enforcer for his desire to kill villains; while Nitro-G gets an earful for not only changing in the open as people outside the cast and crew walked by, staring. The self-styled speedster grins, and Stan barks at him that this is ""serious"". Each is allowed to explain and apologize in their own fashion: almost in tears, Monkey Woman offers that she becomes too focused on goals sometimes, to the point of blocking out things that don't relate to it. Iron Enforcer plays the stereotypical soldier and asserts that he will make up for it in the future, Nitro-G also promises to learn from the experience.

Stan seems to have made up his mind: Nitro-G is told to turn in his costume.

Final opinion?

Pros:
-The initial group is diverse in both origins and character types. In an actual superhero team, Major Victory would be the clear leader. He's the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman"">Captain America, or perhaps <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentry_%28Robert_Reynolds%29"">the Sentry; a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman"">Superman</a>. Unfortunately for him, Stan didn't really create those kinds of characters... his character is more suited to someone from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_comics"">DC</a>, which may reflect poorly on what Stan would be looking for in a hero.
-While I don't like him, I can't say that the Iron Enforcer doesn't have a place in the initial group. He's a clear antihero, even a villain, but if he's careful he'll hang around long enough for the audience to <I>really</i> hate him.
-The second test shines, and it's demonstrative of something vitally important for superheroes. Spiderman, Superman, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman"">Batman</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman"">Wonder Woman</a> remain above the world of normal humans in their regular patrols; they have to be able to spot trouble even while swinging on a web line or flying through the air (whether by invisible jet, bat plane, or whatever <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-waving"">hand-waving</a> supports Kal-El). They have to be more heroic first, <I>super</I> second.

Cons:
-Stan's initial elimination rubs me the wrong way. His characters have always had their own flaws, and although I'd agree with him about the Iron Enforcer, I have to call bullshit on Creature and Levity.
-Not enough time spent on the initial auditiosn: I wanna see more of these people!"

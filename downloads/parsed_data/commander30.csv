<img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/commander30/2624764/2363/2363_900.jpg"" alt=""20160307_172545[1].jpg"" title=""20160307_172545[1].jpg"">

We'll start with Lydia, of course. She'll be eight months old in about a week and is definitely keeping us on our toes. She eats everything (whether it's actually edible or not), talks and babbles all the time, and is fascinated by any new thing. She has two teeth, sits up on her own perfectly, finally decided that she likes rolling around (especially in her crib or when I'm trying to change her diaper), and while she's not crawling yet, she's definitely getting close. 

Unfortunately, she'll soon be sporting a helmet twenty-three hours a day. :( She's been in physical therapy for a few months because of torticollis (basically, she usually has her head cocked to one side) and it's caused the left side of her head to get flattened. So the helmet will get her head evened out, and supposedly may help her even hold her head level, too. I know, I know, in the grand scheme of things this is pretty minor and if this is the worst problem she'll ever face, then she's got it made. I just can't imagine wearing that helmet will be comfortable, especially when she sleeps. 

Gix is still doing fine too. Still working at the university, still composing and arranging, will be the music director for the community theater he's involved with for the third year in a row this coming June. He just recently had another one of his flute choir pieces have its premiere with a featured low flutes expert soloist: https://unomusic.wordpress.com/2016/03/04/eminent-low-flutes-specialist-peter-sheridan-visits-uno/

As for me, I'm still working for the city and playing in flute choir (not the one Gix wrote that piece for, lol... I'm in a much smaller, less formal one). Seeing as I've barely lost any pregnancy weight (and was overweight to begin with even before I got pregnant) I'm trying to get into the habit of working out a couple times a week. Of course, since I work full time, spend the evening with Lydia until her bedtime (around 7 or 7:30 usually), and also since Lydia is a very early riser (between 5 and 6 most mornings... urgh, can't taaaaaake iiiiiiiiiiiittt...) I don't have a whole lot of time in the evenings, especially considering I've been going to bed pretty early lately because I know that little chatterbox baby in the next room will be waking me up at 5:30 lol. Plus there's all the house chores and upkeep that we can't really put off anymore, so I've been trying to keep on top of all of that too.

So as you can imagine, I really haven't had much time for much else. I've been scrapbooking and coloring a little bit, but mostly I've been playing Pokemon on my 3DS. So here's the thing--despite being a 90's kid, I've never actually played any Pokemon games until now. Obviously I knew what it was (I distinctly recall my classmates in sixth grade trading Pokemon cards during lunch), but seeing as the only video games I ever played as a kid were actually computer games, it was just something I never got in to. Gix, on the other hand, is a huge gamer and was really determined to get me hooked on it. I actually started playing X back when I was pregnant with Lydia, believe it or not. I played about halfway through the game but then kind of forgot about it until after Lydia was born. I then finished the game, caught all of the Pokemon I could in that game, and then Gix so so kindly decided to fuel my oncoming addiction and bought me Omega Ruby out of the blue lol. So as of right now, with his help, I have a living dex of 713 Pokemon species, and the only ones I'm missing are the mythical ones that will be released throughout the year anyway. (I was super excited to get my Mew and Celebi!) I've even been going on the GTS to get various form differences of them too. I am a little too proud of the fact that I have acquired all of the non-event patterns of Vivillon. It took a lot of doing! lol so anyway, this whole paragraph is to shake a fist at my husband for getting me hooked on this game... it was no surprise that I, being the completionist I am, literally had to ""catch em all"".

I still haven't lost my love for cartoons, but it's been pretty dormant right now. The cartoon I've been watching the most of is Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, which really isn't too bad a show for the little kid set. Lydia LOVES it, especially the Hot Dog Dance--she freaks out when it comes on at the end of every show.:p But fear not, friends, for these next few years are shaping up to be a great time for us fans of nostalgic cartoons... potentially. I'll wrap this entry up as if it were old times and give my thoughts on two old favorites of mine that are getting rebooted soon.

First, The Powerpuff Girls reboot. My feelings on this are... mixed.  I think it's horrible that Cartoon Network didn't even ask the original VAs of the Girls to reprise their roles (especially learning that they all said that they would have happily done so if they had been asked back). I suppose it's nice that they're giving new female VAs their time in the spotlight. But it still seems really suspect that the rest of the (mostly male) cast still have the same voices, you know what I mean? And watching the clips that CN have been posting to the PPG Facebook page lately, I'm less than impressed with the new choices. Blossom sounds super generic, and Bubbles...  she just doesn't sound like Bubbles at all. She's missing that sweet, bubbly quality to the voice that's obviously necessary for the role. I can live with the new Buttercup... she's passable and is obviously making an effort to infuse the voice with Buttercup's spunk and personality. But Blossom and Bubbles' new voices just aren't doing anything for me.

With that said, I am pretty pleased with the action I felt from the new clips. It may not <i>sound</i> like the Powerpuff Girls, but it <i>looks</i> like the Powerpuff Girls, if you know what I mean? I'm glad that the Girls' updated look didn't stray too far from the originals either. Watching the clips, I thought, ""Yeah, I recognize this. I recognize this as PPG."" If I turn the volume off, I can enjoy it even more! ;)

I will probably tentatively be giving the show a chance when it debuts... whenever it debuts. Next month, I think?

The one reboot I am super excited for is the DuckTales reboot coming next year: http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2016/03/07/new-ducktales-first-image/ LOOK AT THAT TEASER IMAGE. MY DREAMS HAVE COME TRUE. Okay, so calming down a bit, the majority of the criticism I've seen regarding this first look is that the style looks too similar to the new Mickey Mouse shorts, so let me just go on the record and say that I LOVE THE SHIT out of those shorts (the humor, the design, the plots... everything), so of course I'm totally on board with this redesign. My biggest fear when they first announced this was that it would be CGI, so I am of course relieved and ecstatic to see them doing more with this traditional style! And of course, if Donald will be more of a major character this time around, that would be the cherry on top. Hoping that underused characters from the original show like Gladstone Gander and Ludwig Von Drake (still my fave Disney character) get some more love, too!

I'll wrap this rambling entry up now. Hope everyone's doing well. :)"

"event","So on Facebook, I have the Fairly Oddparents page listed under my ""liked"" TV shows. I liked the page ages ago, in fact. I am very fond of the show... the first three seasons. I've been saying that since even before Poof was born, and I've only felt the need to stress ""the first three seasons ONLY!"" only more and more since then.

This means that I saw the stuff they posted awhile ago about... omg... ADDING A NEW CHARACTER! Yes, a show that already has about ten million characters, they got the bright idea to not only add a new one, but a new MAIN character... a stupid looking fairy dog, and from what I've heard he's absolutely horrible. Clearly the writers were running out of ideas. Poof was their first attempt at a saving throw. It was a desperate measure, really. And honestly, that one didn't work out too badly. I've seen some Poof episodes and most of what I've seen were pretty solid. They just needed to firmly establish that this is the new status quo, stop adding even more characters to the cast--oh goddammit you guys.

So first the dog, and then not too long ago, I see them start teasing this new character. ""We're adding a new character to the show!"" Yeah, try doing something you haven't done a million times already. Okay, so it's a new girl at school... whatever. Timmy's new neighbor... okay, whatever, seems stupid but harmless...

""Timmy has to SHARE his fairies!""

Oh you have got to be kidding me.

Anyway, I hate myself, so I just watched the episode today on my lunch break.

I don't know what to say. I really don't. What can you say about a show that clearly ran out of ideas at least three seasons ago but is still desperately trying to churn out new material? What else can you say about an episode that so thoroughly changes the whole dynamic of the show (not even Poof or that damn dog did so to this degree) that you have to change the friggin' THEME SONG because of it?!

And, more importantly... why do I care? I'm nearly thirty years old, I'm a grown-ass adult with a spouse and kid and full-time job and I'm obviously not in the demographic of this show at all. In fact, seeing as I first started watching it in high school, I never WAS really in the demographic even to begin with. So why DO I care?

I guess I care because of what the show USED to be. It was funny, it was clever, it had characters that you cared about. Was it a perfect show? Not by any means. It always had its issues, even in the beginning. But back then, the strengths usually outweighed the weaknesses and produced a show that was worth watching. Now, it's just a show that's... there. And it's been giving out dying gasps for ages now and yet no one has the mercy to just put it out of its misery.

The show deserved better than this, you guys. It deserved to end on a high note, or at least end with some of its dignity still intact. I don't think they can end it like that anymore, not after what they've done to it. It's just too far gone now.

I know, I know... I shouldn't care. I shouldn't care about some silly little kids' show. But this show meant a lot to me. It was actually the fandom that led me to DeviantArt (not that I'm on DA anymore...). I churned out so much fanfic for it. Cosmo/Wanda was my first real OTP and I still adore their relationship. It's why I was okay with the introduction of Poof--and I'm still alright with him as a character. True, the ""add a baby to the main cast"" is usually a last-ditch effort to keep the show going and it usually backfires, but come on, this is Cosmo and Wanda's baby, something that most of us FOP fans (especially us Cosmo/Wanda shippers) had been wanting to see since the beginning, so I can't hate the character at all. But... let's be honest. The show should have ended there. It really should have ended before there, actually.

Right now, I'm honestly embarrassed to admit to liking the show. Even with that all-important qualifier ""only the first three seasons!"". It's just been stomped so thoroughly into the ground that it's even tainted my memories of what it used to be.

I do have a couple of early episodes on a flash drive somewhere, though... oh yes, and there's also this channel!

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA8OH52te7LLg_O9T7lZFEA/featured

Looks to be the first four seasons... and it's apparently the production company behind those seasons, so it's doubtful the channel will be taken down (fingers crossed!).

I think I know what I'm watching tonight to get the bad taste of the newest season out of my head."

"event","I'm posting this a little earlier than usual, but since one of the questions is ""what WILL you be doing for Christmas"" as opposed to ""what DID you do for Christmas"" I figure I've been posting it too late in previous years anyway.

No, I don't know why I keep doing these. I guess I like looking back on them down the road and seeing where I was at the end of each year.

<lj-cut text=""2015 in review""><b>1. What did you do in 2015 that you'd never done before?</b>
Gave birth. lol that was a trip.

<b>2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b>
I didn't make any... but I actually am making one for next year, and that's to severely limit my Facebook time, if not entirely quit it cold turkey. Why? It's a presidential election year... enough said. (I also don't like any of the candidates... no, not even Bernie Sanders... but admitting that on my Facebook page would probably make about half of my friends faint in shock lol. The cult of Bernie is strong with my friends.)

<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b>
I did, do I count? lol. Actually, a lot of people I know had babies this year. Seemed my Facebook feed was overflowing with babies (when it wasn't overflowing with politics).

<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b>
A former co-worker of mine from the library. It was a really sad situation. She and three of her friends from college were driving at night and swerved to hit a deer, and hit an oncoming car instead. All four of them died instantly. They were all really young, too--early 20's. Such a horrible loss. :(

<b>5. What countries did you visit?</b>
None... lol this question. I haven't visited a different country since 2008 (not that I don't want to, but it's kind of not feasible at this point in my life)

<b>6. What would you like to have in 2016 that you lacked in 2015?</b>
Uh... a flat stomach? lol

<b>7. What date from 2015 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b>
July 17th. Happy birthday sweet baby girl!

<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b>
Lydia, and the house! Both pretty freaking important. :D

<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b>
Hmm. The only thing that comes to mind was failing to breastfeed, but honestly, I prefer formula feeding much better anyway, and at least I recognized that breastfeeding wasn't working before going back to work and trying to pump, so I don't see it as a failure as much as a blessing in disguise. :)

<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b>
Ugh. You know, I hardly ever get sick, but I don't know if it's from giving birth or what... but I've basically had a cold since September. With a couple of really awful days of that cold, too. I thought I was finally getting over it in November, but then it either came back with a vengeance or I caught a different one. Again, I think I'm finally getting over this one... please please PLEASE don't let me suddenly get it back again!

<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b>
DA HOUSSSSSSSSSE

<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b>
Everyone who's helped me with Lydia! The nurses at the hospital, my OBGYN, Lydia's pediatrician, the lactation consultant (even though I ultimately threw in the towel, I wouldn't have lasted even that long without her)--and especially my mom, mother-in-law, and the friend of me and Gix who we kind of consider our in-town mom, who were all willing to watch Lydia while we were in daycare limbo for a few weeks! (Long story.)

<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b>
A lot of public figures, which is why I've cut myself off from the news (and by extension the internet) as much as humanly possible. Last year's answer, and also see above re. my new year's resolution.

<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b>
<lj-embed id=""188""/>

Also, stuff for Lydia, obviously.

<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b>
Lydia! And the house!

<b>16. What song will always remind you of 2015?</b>
<lj-embed id=""189""/>

Not a song from 2015 obviously, but I discovered it this year and found it such a happy, relaxing, beautiful song.

<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you:

i. happier or sadder?</b> Happier. :)

<b>ii. thinner or fatter?</b> Errr... about the same, I guess, but that's obviously not to say that my weight didn't go up and down this past year. I may be a little fatter than this time last year. I don't think I've lost the last few pregnancy pounds, and I haven't worked up the guts to step on the scale to check lol

<b>iii. richer or poorer?</b> Errrrrrrrr... again, probably about the same, but not because things there stayed stagnant either.

<b>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b>
I don't know. I don't really have the time to be wishing to do more of anything, really.

<b>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b>
See above? I mean, I'm getting what needs to be done done lol

<b>20. How will you be spending Christmas?</b>
My in-laws are coming up on December 22nd in their RV, with my stepson. They'll stay until Christmas Day, so we'll have Christmas with them at our house Christmas Eve. Christmas Day Gix, the kids (damn that's weird to type), and I will go to my parents' house for that gathering and possibly stay the night--we haven't decided yet.

<b>21. At any point in the past year did you do something that you consider completely out of your usual character?</b>
Have a baby lololol everyone likes to remind me how I used to declare I'd NEVER have kids

<b>22. Did you fall in love in 2015?</b>
Nah. I guess platonically/maternally with Lydia, but I don't really think that counts for this question.

<b>23. How many one-night stands?</b>
Zero

<b>24. What was your favorite TV program?</b>
Didn't watch a whole lot of TV. The only new show I've been watching consistently is the Muppets, and I've also been staying on top of Big Bang Theory, and for fun/relaxing we usually pull up some Let's Make a Deal. (Did I mention Gix got a Roku? Now we actually can watch TV, lol)

<b>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</b>
Not really.

<b>26. What was the best book you read this year?</b>
argh I feel bad. I hardly read anything this year other than pregnancy/baby books.

<b>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b>
I dunno.

<b>28. What did you want and get?</b>
A baby! And a house! Two for two!

<b>29. What did you want and not get?</b>
I honestly can't think of anything. :)

<b>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b>
Hmm. I saw Jurassic World, Inside Out, and Peanuts (I don't think I've seen any other new films this year) and they were all good... but I can probably fully say that my favorite film of this year I haven't seen yet. STAR WARS THE FORCE AWAKENS BABY! I am SO FRIGGIN' EXCITED! No spoilers or I will end you. :P

(next day edit) The stars aligned and I was actually able to see Star Wars today, and yes, best movie of the year. But damn, way to pull out my heart and stab it repeatedly! It will take awhile to emotionally heal from that...

<b>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b>
We left Lydia at my parents', went to the Husker game against Northwestern and stayed for half of it (they sucked, as was their normal operating mode this year), and then went back to Omaha and started moving more things from the apartment to the house, as we had just closed on it four days previously. Then we went out to eat at a Mexican restaurant for supper. I turned 29! Can't believe I'm nearly 30, gah. Where has my life gone?!

<b>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b>
Uh... you know, 2015 has been a great year overall, so I'm having trouble thinking of anything. Losing all of the pregnancy weight (and the extra weight I was carrying before I even got pregnant)? Yeah, that would have been nice. Let's see if I can't manage that next year!

<b>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2015?</b>
Maternity clothes. Sadly I'm still wearing a lot of them lol. I have a bunch of jeans that do fit me, though--hooray for elastic waist jeans! :)

<b>34. What kept you sane?</b>
Phht. Myself, I guess? This year, especially the second half of it, has been crazy, but I haven't felt like I was teetering on the edge of sanity (except for those couple of days after Lydia was born that I got a touch of the baby blues, but that's pretty common from what I understand).

<b>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b>
None

<b>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</b>
Probably the Syrian refugees, and I'll be the first to admit my new-mom hormones probably had a lot to do with that. I still can't think about the picture of the little boy's body washed up on the shore without tearing up a bit. :( Needless to say, I'm fully supportive of refugees and think the USA should take some in.

<b>37. Who did you miss?</b>
Can't really think of anyone.

<b>38. Who was the best new person you met?</b>
Lydia! She's such a sweetheart. :) Again I admit that I'm biased.

<b>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2015.</b>
I don't know. I feel like if I learn a lesson from anything, it takes a long time for me to realize that a lesson was learned.

<b>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:</b>
I never answer this question, I should just remove it lol"

"event","I wasn't planning on writing this, because trust me, I don't think strangers (or even people I know) care too much about my birth story, but I wanted to write it all down while it was still fresh in my mind, and I also am thinking about submitting it to a mom group I'm in on Facebook (because despite my thoughts, I actually do enjoy reading other people's birth stories to an extent). It's also kind of long, but I feel like I need to start at the beginning (that is, the beginning of James's and my relationship) to tell the whole story.

I don't go into too much graphic detail, but general warnings for talking about miscarriage, pregnancy, and childbirth in here. Also, again, it's long. Don't say I didn't warn you. :P (Actually, again, I don't care if anyone reads this or not... just wanted to write it down for myself)

<lj-cut text=""Birth story."">In high school and college, I always said I'd never get married or have kids. It figures, then, that I ended up marrying a divorced dad. When James and I first started dating, I told him I didn't want kids, and he told me he didn't want any more kids, so we seemed to be in agreement there. However, after a few months, James admitted to me that he'd had a change of heart and actually did want to have children with me. I was upset, to say the least, but after spending enough time with Asher, his son, and realizing that taking care of a kid wasn't so bad (and also seeing how good of a dad James was), by the time we were married I was not opposed to having children of my own. I still didn't exactly *want* children, but I didn't *not* want them either. James and I were married in August 2012 and I went off birth control around that time. We decided to not actively try for a baby, but to not actively prevent a pregnancy from happening, either.

Fast forward to December 30, 2013. We have Asher during the summer and every other Christmas and this Christmas he was with us. I had taken off some time from work to watch him, and that particular day I was finding him difficult to deal with. In an attempt to have a little peace, I went to the bathroom, and figured I should take a pregnancy test while I was at it. I hadn't had a period since early November, but my periods are usually irregular, and I had taken a pregnancy test right before we picked up Asher for the holidays which had turned out negative. But this one, lo and behold, was positive. I was not happy, to put it lightly. I even remember crying a bit, and not from happiness. How, I thought, could I take care of my own baby 24/7 when I could barely handle two weeks with my stepson, who I logically knew is a very easy and well-behaved kid? I even thought for a moment that I hoped I would have a miscarriage, a thought that haunts me to this day. I told James the news when he got home from work. He could tell I was a bit upset and had to comfort me, but he could barely contain his excitement. So much so, in fact, that he immediately called his parents to tell them. I remember telling him ""isn't it a little early for that yet?"" Going off of my last period, I was seven weeks pregnant at that time.

Since he had told his parents, I reluctantly figured I'd better tell mine. Of course none of our parents could keep it a secret from our families, and since I especially have a large family, a lot of people were in on our ""little secret"". I scheduled what I believed would be my twelve week appointment on January 22 and asked everyone to keep it off of Facebook until that time.

At that appointment, we were surprised to find out that the baby was only measuring about eight weeks. But then I remembered how the pregnancy test I had taken right before Christmas came up negative, which it shouldn't have been if I had been as far along as I thought I was. I told the sonographer that I had irregular periods which would account for the baby not measuring how it was ""supposed"" to. Other than that, the baby had a strong heartbeat and looked perfectly healthy. I was only eight weeks along, not twelve, but since I had told my family I'd be making the pregnancy public that day, along with a successful ultrasound, I went ahead and announced my pregnancy on Facebook. It was a bit of a bittersweet day for me as my grandmother died of leukemia that day, so I was glad that my dad had told her about my pregnancy beforehand. My new due date was September 4, 2014.

On the night of Saturday, February 8, I noticed some light spotting as I was getting ready for bed. I quickly looked it up and found that usually it was nothing too concerning. I wasn't in any pain, so I figured I'd just keep an eye on it and hope that it stopped eventually. I spotted all day Sunday, and Sunday night I told James that if I was still spotting in the morning, I wanted to have it checked out. Monday morning I wasn't just spotting. I was bleeding like a full-on period. I still wasn't having any cramps or pain, but I new I needed to go to the hospital. We both called in to work and went to the ER. After meeting with a doctor briefly I was wheeled into the ultrasound room (which I found strange because I was perfectly capable of walking). The sonographer told me she wanted to do a vaginal ultrasound, so I had to go to the bathroom and wipe up as best I can. When I did I was actually passing blood clots. I got back on the table and she poked around, and showed me the screen saying ""there's your baby!"" Then she turned the screen away from me and continued to look around. James was watching the screen too. I knew before they even told me. They didn't have any huge expression changes or start bawling or anything like that, but it was just so quiet in that room for a few moments and I just knew. Finally the sonographer said to me, very apologetically, ""I'm sorry, but I can't find the heartbeat."" James later told me that the embryo was only measuring about eight and a half weeks, not the ten and a half weeks it should have been. It had died just a few days after our first ultrasound.

I won't go into the nitty-gritty of the miscarriage, but needless to say it was very painful, both physically and emotionally. Logically I knew that I had done nothing to cause it, and yet I kept thinking back to my ""I hope I miscarry"" thought when I had first found out I was pregnant. James, if anything, took it even harder than I had, and spent the next week or so just holed up in Asher's room, barely leaving and barely talking when he did venture out. I told him that even though there was no real way of knowing, I felt that the baby had been a girl, and even though we had picked out both a boy name and a girl name, we began to refer to the miscarried child by a different name than the one we had picked: Anna. In some ways it helped to name her, in other ways it made it worse.

I don't really believe in fate or destiny, but I wanted there to be some reason why I had to have that miscarriage. The only reason I could think of was so that I could get pregnant in the time between the miscarriage and Septmeber 4th, the due date. Anna had to die so that our hypothetical other child could live. Again, we weren't trying to get pregnant, but I cannot tell you how inwardly devastating it was when I kept on getting my period. September 4 finally came... and I had my period a few days later. So much for everything having a reason. October my period came as well.

Then came Veteran's Day. James and I had just gotten home from band practice and I was planning on relaxing with a glass of wine before bed. My period was technically a few days late, although like I said, having irregular periods meant that this wasn't a big deal at all for me. I actually remember telling James ""I'm going to take this pregnancy test just to make sure I'm not pregnant, and then open up that bottle of wine."" I took it, and... two lines. One was very faint. ""So what does it say?"" James asked (he'd still been hoping I'd get pregnant again after all this time). ""Uh... I don't know?"" I answered back. It was honestly so faint I thought I was seeing things.  I took another one and same thing. ""I guess I'd better not have that wine,"" I told James. Pulled up a due date estimator online--due July 15th, 2015. James and I were smiling, but they were such cautious and nervous smiles. I didn't have to tell him this time to not tell the family right away. I was four weeks, six days along.

My OB's office had me come in for an ultrasound the next month. It was pretty much the same as the last time--the baby was measuring eight weeks (although at least this time the timeline was as we expected) with a strong, steady heartbeat. But since we'd seen all that with Anna, I still wasn't getting my hopes up. We visited my in-laws for Christmas a few weeks later and we knew we'd have to let them know, so we got them coffee mugs that said ""Grandma/Grandpa Round 2, Coming July 2015"". They were ecstatic! We called Asher that day and let him know too--he was only mildly interested as his mother had just had a baby and having a baby sibling was nothing new to him. A few days later we were at my parents' and told them as well. My parents had actually wanted to take us all on a family vacation in July, and I had to keep deflecting my dad's questions about what days in July would work for me until everyone was in the room and I finally let the cat out the bag. Luckily my parents didn't mind their summer plans getting a massive overhaul. I was about eleven weeks along at this time, and still no spotting (I was honestly expecting it every day), so I finally decided to make a Christmas announcement on Facebook as well. But I knew I wouldn't breathe easily until the next ultrasound on January 2nd. This was the optional ultrasound to check for different conditions such as Down syndrome. When I told my mom that, she asked me what I would do if i found my baby had Down syndrome or something else--I think she was worried that I would abort it. I just shrugged and told her we'd prepare for it, but honestly the medical conditions being tested for weren't why I had scheduled that ultrasound. I just wanted to make sure that the baby was still alive in there.

That was honestly the best ultrasound ever. The eight week ultrasound basically looked like a little stationary jellybean. At the twelve week one, not only was the baby moving around like crazy, but it was very easy to make out all the body parts--the face, the hands and feet, everything! For the first time I wasn't feeling trepidation about this pregnancy--well, as much trepidation, anyway. The baby wasn't ever in the right position to check for the Down syndrome markers, so I was offered the chance to come in again in a few days. I took it--again, not because I had any concern over Down syndrome, but just because I wanted another ultrasound to make sure everything was still alright. Everything checked out fine, which meant our next ultrasound was at twenty weeks, or the start of March.

It was around this month--January, month four of my pregnancy--that I started getting so-called ""morning"" sickness. I never had any symptoms in the first trimester (in either pregnancy) but suddenly I was puking and nauseous at the start of the second trimester, against what all pregnancy guidebooks claimed. James was a saint running to Walgreens in the middle of the night to get me things to settle my stomach. Even with finally getting pregnancy symptoms, I still worried, feeling every day that I was going to lose this pregnancy too. Going in for my sixteen-week checkup and hearing the heartbeat was reassuring, for that day at least. So was my blooming baby bump. But as I couldn't feel any kicks yet, I spent pretty much every day afraid that something was going to happen. The twenty-week ultrasound couldn't come fast enough. James was anxious to know the sex, but again, I just wanted to see that the baby was alive and healthy. James really wanted a girl, and before we went in I had to make sure he was mentally prepared for the possibility of another boy and wouldn't be completely devastated by the news--while mentally preparing myself for not being able to find a heartbeat, which I still felt was going to happen.

Thankfully, I was wrong. The baby was growing as expected, but once again very uncooperative and not in the right position to check for sex or some of the other measurements the sonographer had to take. So we had to go in yet again for another ultrasound in a few days. The baby was a bit more obliging that day, and when the sonographer told us ""looks like you're having a girl!"" James couldn't have been more thrilled. I ran by the girl name we had decided on way back in our first pregnancy to make sure we both still liked it--Lydia Jane. We did. Now I was halfway through the pregnancy, my baby girl was healthy and growing, and she had a name. (Which we kept secret.) It was around that time that I finally started to be able to feel her move. It was sporadic at first, but eventually it became fairly regular. This helped ease my mind a bit from constantly worrying if she was okay, but at the same time I would still get a bit panicky if I hadn't felt her move in awhile. She wasn't a super-active baby who kept me up all night, but every time I did start worrying, she'd eventually give me a little jab to let me know all was well.

When I was around 33 weeks I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It was a bit of a drag to have to make changes to my diet and check my blood four times a day, and since I was diagnosed rather late in my pregnancy I was terrified of having a huge baby, especially since I myself was a rather large baby (and my birth legitimately gave my mother PTSD).  But there were perks to having GD, like being told to snack more often (beautiful words for a pregnant woman to hear!) and also more ultrasounds! Luckily she was not only at the average weight and size for her gestational age, but she had also settled down into a head-first position after being transverse fora while. The only thing of slight concern during that ultrasound was that the amniotic fluid was on the low side of okay levels. My OB said they'd be keeping an eye on that, because if the levels got too much lower that probably meant that the placenta wasn't working as it should and I'd need to be induced. By that time, especially once I hit 37 weeks and was full-term, I was more than ready to get the baby out, so the possibility of induction didn't scare me. We got Asher for the summer, I finished up my last few weeks of work before maternity leave started, and then... I waited. I did a lot of the things that supposedly start labor when I wasn't at my twice-weekly non-stress tests. At every other NST my OB examined me and was always shocked at how low the baby was, and how thin my cervix was (even though I hadn't started dilating). I felt like it had to be soon.

Wednesday, July 15th was the due date, and even though I was having irregular contractions, some very strong ones, they always went away when I changed positions, and I still hadn't dilated any. At the advice of my mother we went bowling that night to try to start labor. It didn't work, but I swear the baby dropped even lower, if that was at all possible. However, it was nice to spend some time with just the three of us--James, Asher, and me. It would our last outing as a group of three. 

I had another NST the afternoon of July 16th. Even though I had gotten to bed at a decent hour, I still slept in until noon (which I would be very thankful for in the next few days!). I quickly had to get ready, wake up Asher (who had also slept in that late), and get us to the OB's office for yet another NST. I had had one that Monday and the baby hadn't moved around as much as they would have liked, so I had had to have yet another ultrasound. My amniotic fluid had dropped even lower, from a 8.2 to around a 6. Eight was the minimum level I had been told was okay before, but my OB still felt everything was fine and had let me go. Well, at this NST, yet again the baby didn't move as much as they wanted, I had another ultrasound, and the amniotic fluid had dropped even lower, below a five. We were told to wait in a room for my OB--James had taken the afternoon off from work so he could be there this time, so he, Asher, and I were all waiting in the room--but not for too long. My OB came in and immediately said "" Your amniotic fluid is getting too low and we'll need to induce you. Do you want to be induced tonight or tomorrow morning?"" I could have dropped down to my knees and sang the Hallelujah Chorus at that point--and in my mind, that's exactly what I was doing. I was completely ready to get the process started that night, and I just needed at least an hour and a half for my parents to drive up to be able to watch Asher while James and I were in the hospital. We did some last minute errands, went out for supper with my parents when they arrived, and checked in at 7:00 that evening. 

After being asked if I had a birth plan and answering that my plan was to get the baby out and that an epidural would be nice (I think the nurses were relieved I was such an easy patient), they got me started on the pitocin at 8:00. The baby was at +2 station (the nurses all thought that was a typo until they checked for themselves and realized yes, the baby really was that low) and my cervix was still very thin, but hadn't dilated before getting the pit. After a few hours I was dilating, but not as fast as they would have liked, so they made the decision to break my water and also give me an epidural, since the nurse told me that my contractions would likely get much more intense at that point. I got the epidural at about 1:30 AM. The anesthesiologist looked very tired and out of it, but she was quick and efficient, and it didn't hurt a bit--getting the IV in my hand earlier was much more painful. About half an hour later, my water was broken. Because I had already gotten the epidural, I didn't feel a thing. I tried to sleep but didn't really get a lot--thank goodness I had slept in so late the previous day!

In the morning, when the nurses switched shifts, our day nurse told us how long she was scheduled for that day and said ""by the time I leave, you'll have that baby!' I wish I could remember her name; she was awesome. They were raising my pit levels little by little and my labor was progressing with stronger contractions--I only knew they were stronger because I could see the readout on the computer screen, mind you. The epidural was doing its job fantastically and I couldn't feel a thing below my chest. James and I watched a little TV, and my parents and stepson came by later that morning to see how were were doing. The morning was pretty uneventful, other than me suddenly getting very nauseous at one point. They ran anti-nausea medication through the IV and I had almost instant relief. At the rate I was progressing, our nurse guessed I'd be delivering our baby late afternoon or early evening.

Around noon, James went and got lunch and brought it back to the room so he could eat and still be there with me. Almost instantly after he finished I started to feel pain for the first time, both in my vaginal and rectal area. It wasn't unbearable, but it was definitely noticeable and a lot of pressure, so I had James go out and tell our nurse, thinking that my epidural was failing. The nurse came in very excited, telling me that this was good news. She checked me and, lo and behold, I was nine and a half centimeters dilated. I would be pushing sooner than I thought!

Pretty soon the room was crowded with people. I had been asked if I minded a number of different people to observe the birth--such is giving birth in a teaching hospital. I said yes to all of them, figuring they had to learn somehow. Some of them told me that they had witness a number of c-sections, but never a vaginal birth, which I found odd. With all of these people in the room, though, no one could find my OB. My body and baby weren't going to wait--I was soon fully dilated, and was getting the first comments about the baby--""wow, that is a LOT of hair"". This was literally everyone's reaction when looking at me as they were getting me into the birthing position. I was offered a mirror to have a look for myself, and while I hadn't planned on using a mirror at all, curiosity finally got the better of me thanks to literally everyone commenting on it, so they positioned the mirror and... yes. The first look I got of my daughter was her very full head of dark, dark hair. My OB still wasn't there, but our main nurse told us that we couldn't wait--it was time to push. As she told us she'd been a labor and delivery nurse for about thirty years I wasn't worried--she definitely knew what she was doing. She got all of the medical students and my husband into position and made note of what time it was when I started to push--1:29 PM.

Pushing was horrible. I still had the epidural so it didn't hurt (at first) but it was completely exhausting, and I quickly began to dread every time I was told to push again. I felt that I wasn't making any progress and had to keep asking James and my OB (who finally arrived after a few minutes of me pushing) if I was progressing at all. They all assured me I was and that I was doing great, but I sure didn't feel like it. Every push was exhausting and took more and more out of me, and I kept having to do it, over and over.

I think it was about an hour into the pushing when I started to feel the contractions and didn't have to be told to push. I'm guessing that they either forgot or didn't bother to top of my epidural at that point. The contractions weren't painful, but I was able to say ""do I need to push now?"" before anyone had the chance to tell me. By that point I could tell she was so close, but I was just losing stamina and I remember saying at one point ""I don't think I can do this anymore."" Again everyone told me that I was doing great and it wouldn't be much longer now, and I could tell how close I was, I could feel her head nearly out of me, I felt just one more push should do it... one more push didn't do it... maybe this one... okay, maybe this one...

And then suddenly I'm no longer feeling pressure there and James shouts ""She's out!"" I don't exactly remember everything that happened at this point. Like I said, I was utterly exhausted and was in a bit of a daze, the whole ""did I just give birth?"" sort of daze. I remember thinking ""why isn't she crying, shouldn't I be hearing a cry right about now?"" but then I did, not a very loud one but still hearty-sounding. ""Here's your baby!"" my OB said, holding up this little wrinkled, bunched-up baby with a full head of hair with skin grayer than I was expecting (I later learned that her skin colorization was pretty normal for being only just out of the womb). It was 2:42 PM on Friday, July 17, 2015.

Not too long after holding her up for me to see, my OB handed my baby to me. ""Hi, Lydia,"" I said to her and put her on my chest. By now she was crying pretty strongly. I put her to my breast in an attempt to nurse her, but my aim was off and she ended up bruising me to the side of the nipple, when she wasn't busy crying. I didn't even notice the bruise at first, though--because I was noticing a lot more pain down where Lydia had just exited me. My OB and a few of the medical students were still down there and I felt like I was getting stabbed with a white-hot knife repeatedly. I realized that I must have been getting stitches, and I asked James, ""Did I tear?"" He looked at me like I was nuts and said, ""uh, no, they cut you."" I had had an episiotomy and didn't even realize until after the fact. I worried at first that I had gotten one simply because I had momentarily wimped out and thought I couldn't do it anymore, but James later told me that Lydia hadn't actually been moving the last few pushes before the episiotomy. But apparently, once my OB made that cut, then Lydia just slipped right out. Perhaps I should be upset that it was done without asking me first, but knowing the mental state I was in at the time, my OB could have said ""we need to cut off your legs and disembowel you to get this baby out"" and I would have said ""YES YES DO ANYTHING JUST GET HER OUT"", so it's all good.

However, the stitches were not. Now I knew that the epidural had worn off because I felt EVERYTHING. I was wincing and holding a crying newborn and still mentally in a daze that I was actually holding my daughter and... suddenly my chest felt warm and sticky. ""Uh, I think she pooped on me!"" I announced. Our main nurse took her from me momentarily to clean both her and me up, because yes, she had indeed pooped on me.

Soon enough, Lydia was back on my chest (with a diaper on) and my OB and all of the medical students in the room were congratulating me. The stitches were done and everyone began filing out one by one. Soon it was just me, James, and Lydia, which was nice. I don't regret having all of those students in the room as they were a big help and I was glad to be able to help them in their education, but things were pretty busy and chaotic with so many bodies in the room and it was great to have the opportunity to wind down a bit and get to enjoy our first moments with Lydia, who had calmed down and was gaining the new-baby color I was expecting. After our hour together, we called our parents to tell them the news, Lydia was weighed and measured (and came in at 7 lbs 8 oz and 20 inches long, a completely average sized baby despite my fears to the contrary), and then we were wheeled up to our recovery room!

I could go on and on, as Lydia's birth is only the beginning, one small part of her story. But, then again, her story has only just begun and I will probably never be able to finish it. Lydia Jane has so far been nothing but a joy, and I'm so glad that my husband and I changed each other's minds about having (more) babies."

"event","-Lydia is three months old as of this past Saturday and doing really well! She eats like a horse and is already in six month sized clothing. She also babbles and smiles a lot!

-My birthday is this coming Saturday and I'll be 29... last year of my twenties. Does that mean it's my last year before I'm really old? ;) I kid, I kid. We're going to the Husker game against Northwestern because I hate myself and want to cry on my birthday. (We're 3-4 this season, and those four losses have all literally been in the last SECONDS of the game. It's heartbreaking to be a Nebraskan this year, lol. But they played a good game last weekend, so hopefully they keep their act together for my birthday too!)

-However, we'll probably be leaving after the halftime show, and not just because I don't want to see them lose again. It's because we're moving! WE CLOSED ON OUR HOUSE TODAY! That's right, after the first house we wanted not accepting a VA loan and a string of houses we were really interested in getting bought ten minutes afterwards, we found a beautiful house still on the (very in-demand) school district I wanted to stay in, 3 bed 3 bath, built-in 2-car garage, HUGE backyard, impeccable upkeep from the seller, only one block away from the assigned elementary school (and again, in a very in-demand and fantastic school district)... and it was still available! Gix viewed it on a Thursday, I went with him again on a Friday, we made an offer Saturday, and after a little back and forth that night... we both came to an agreement. And today we closed on the house! We have the keys! WE HAVE A HOUSE, GUYS. This is still so hard to believe. I could hardly get Gix to even think about buying a house even a few months ago. I think the realities of having Lydia made him change his mind. And... WE HAVE A HOUSE! Still can't believe it. We're going to be moving over as much as we can starting tonight, and my parents will be coming on Monday with a U-Haul with furniture I inherited from my grandma to help us move the big stuff! Hopefully by the end of the day Monday we'll be mostly moved in!

-Today is also my stepson's tenth birthday! Gix talked to him on the phone a few days ago and told him about the house, but it'll be fun to actually call him to wish him a happy birthday from his new bedroom. :)

-Sam's Club was offering free membership for a year to new moms last month. I wasn't sure if it was real or not, but I emailed my info and sure enough, I got a card in the mail about a week ago! We took it in and got signed up, and oh man is it nice to be able to get stuff at Sam's without having to go with my mom and pay her back. The $2 gallon of milk alone is worth it. :D

That's about it. Life's been going great! 2015 has been a great year (knock on wood). So excited for the future!

GO BIG RED!"

"event","<lj-cut text=""I'm posting this to LJ because I would lose too many friends if I posted this on my Facebook."">This is a post I can't make on Facebook. I just can't. I have a number of friends--women who are wonderful people, mind you--who post articles and statuses about the very things I'm bitching about right here. And this has been building up for awhile--even when I was pregnant. Hell, even before I got pregnant. The whole ""you're a whole different person when you become a mother! Unless if you've squeezed a baby out of your vagina, you DON'T KNOW REAL LOVE."" And I thought, hell, maybe I really don't get it. Maybe having a baby will make me get it.

Well, I have a baby now. And I still don't get it.

(I apologize in advance that this entry will, like most of my journal entries, be long and rambling. And slightly bitchy. But also very depressed on account of these mothers who lose all sense of identity after having a kid. Also, possibly TMI talk about my boobs? lol)

What ended up pushing me over the edge and having to write <i>something</i> was a friend of mine posting a couple of articles from this blog: http://thenewlywifedlife.blogspot.com/ You know, inspiring stuff, the whole ""I totally needed this today!"" post. All fine and dandy.

I took a look at the blog, read through some of the posts... and oh my god, this is one of the most depressing blogs I have ever read.

I mean, you have to look for them, but there's plenty of entries where the new mother talks about how much she struggled with breastfeeding for the first six months of her daughter's life, so much that her baby was actually failing to gain weight. Even now, her baby who is almost a year old weighs barely more than my own baby who's only two months old. And while my baby is in the 80th percentile, she's not, you know, the 110th percentile or anything. She's not an abnormally large baby or anything. Even though she supposedly has the hang of breastfeeding, her child is still very, very small for her age. And I don't know, maybe it's genetic. Maybe that is a healthy for her child. But that baby just looks so... emaciated.

There is a cult of breastfeeding. All of the moms who are so gung-ho about it will tell you that breastfeeding is completely discouraged anymore, that formula is encouraged over it. Now I will admit that there are definitely prudes and jerks out there who for whatever reason get offended when a mother, even discretely, just pops out a boob to feed her baby. And yes, that's ridiculous. Feeding a baby is a boob's function.

...but that's just it. They're <i>functional</i>. They have a job to do, and for the women who are able to utilize them for their intended purpose (more on that in a minute), that's just great. They're a means to an end. They're not some all-mighty magical healing glands of amazingness that all must bow down and worship, they do not have magic and instant bonding powers that will tie you and your baby together with love until the end of time, and they do not cure any and all ills and give your child superpowers.

So personal story time. When I was pregnant with Lydia, I was wanting to at least try to breastfeed her, even though I was actually realistic and knew that it might not work. (If genetics are anything to go by, luck was not on my side--my mom's reaction when I told her I was wanting to try was ""Well, good luck. I tried with all three of you, too, but could never get it to work."") I read all of the statistics about how breastfed babies are less likely to get sick, more likely to have a higher IQ, how breastfeeding mothers lose the pregnancy weight faster and are less likely to develop breast and ovarian cancer, and those were all nice perks and all, but I have to admit the main reason I wanted to breastfeed was a practical (and lazy) one--I'm cheap as fuck. Formula is super expensive. Why would I spend buttloads of money on food for my kid when my body could produce it for free? Having said all that, I was always prepared for the possibility of breastfeeding not working out for me, and I accepted that. I went to a class with a lactation consultant while I was still pregnant and armed myself with information, but I didn't have my heart completely set on it. Thank God I didn't, too, because I can't imagine how much WORSE I would have felt when it became clear it wasn't going to work out. Yes, worse. I felt bad enough as it was.

The first two days after Lydia was born were spent recovering in the hospital. Another lactation consultant visited us both of those days. And for the record, she was great and a total champ and I wouldn't have lasted even the couple of weeks breastfeeding that I ultimately did without her. I have super flat nipples that really only get pointy when I'm cold, so she got me nipple shells and shields that molded them a bit and gave Lydia something to, you know, actually latch on to. And Lydia had a great latch. My failure to breastfeed was not on her. If my breasts had actually, you know, lactated enough to keep up with her, I'd probably still be breastfeeding her.

But you see, that's the problem. My milk came in, alright, but it was really only enough to soak through my bras a bit. Any time I tried nursing Lydia, she never seemed to get much out of it. Gix actually dropped $250 on an electric breast pump, and when I tried pumping for a good forty-five minutes, all that came out were a few drops. I was very quickly at the point where I was only nursing her once a day, with formula the rest of the day, and even with that one nursing she was usually hungry enough afterwards that I'd have to give her a bottle anyway.

I wanted to give up, but I'd already bought more nipple shields, plus that friggin expensive breast pump (like I said, I'm cheap and I hate wasting money), so I was still determined to get even that once-or-twice-a-day nursing to work. It wouldn't be breastfeeding with supplemental formula, it would be more like formula-feeding with supplemental breastmilk, but hey, at least all of this breastfeeding paraphernalia to assist with the supposedly ""free"" breastfeeding would still be put to use! So I looked through all of the books and pamphlets about breastfeeding, childbirth, and babies in general for advice on how to jump-start a low supply.

They made me sob and hate myself.

Page after page extolling all of breatmilk's benefits. Page after page of tips of how to help a baby's poor latch (helpful for those who have that problem, but it was not my problem) and sore/cracked nipples (again, helpful information but not what I was looking for--breastfeeding was never painful for me in any way). Regarding low supply, however, there was very little. The advice amounted to basically pumping to get the supply up (which did nothing) and to just feed your baby more often to get the supply up, because it's a matter of supply and demand!

And I thought, ""Excuse me? I'm barely producing anything from my boobs and you're telling me to just shove the baby to the boob and force her to suck and suck with hardly any benefit MORE OFTEN?!""

And then--in the ones that even mentioned formula feeding at all--you get to the measly one page about it and the very first sentence is ""Breastmilk is best for your baby.""

Congratulations, Mom, for not giving your baby the best. You suck.

That's why I cried. I felt like a failure.

But I was also pissed. Pissed at the way that the whole breastfeeding movement, which claims to try to empower women, was belittling women who either wouldn't or <i>couldn't</i> do it ""the right way"". Pissed that it was implying that my brothers and I should have turned out sickly, fat, and stupid because our mother fed us that terrible formula, when in fact all of us are perfectly healthy and very smart. (My younger brother's working on his PhD in chemistry and physics, for Christ's sake. And he's still skinny as a rail and has run a few half-marathons. My older brother also runs 7-8 miles every single friggin' morning. All of us have climbed at least a couple of mountains in our time. None of us have ever had a major illness. We were all formula fed. Tell me again all of the bad things that'll happen if you feed your kid formula, hmmmmmmmmm? Sorry, ranty tangent over.)

Basically, I was pissed enough that I threw away all of the nipple shields and cups, threw away that super-expensive breast pump because it was making me angry and depressed just by looking at it, and announced to Gix that I was done trying even the one morning nursing session. We were going to be feeding Lydia formula only. I was relieved. Lydia ate much better without me trying to force the breastfeeding issue and finally started gaining weight. Gix was happier too since we both were happier. I'm glad I decided to give up on breastfeeding, and I know I would have been even more miserable if I had still continued to try after that.

Now, back to the blog. This blogger, while not having the same issues with breastfeeding that I did, still obviously struggled with it. But instead of accepting that it wasn't working for her and her child, she still kept trying, even as her child failed to gain weight, and honestly even the most recent pictures of her child... that poor girl looks very frail. And even more damning--there's a particularly depressing post where she admits that all of the strain on her trying to feed her child, the constant nursing and pumping, has all but destroyed her marriage. She wrote that she and her husband react angrily to each other now and that they're in therapy to try to salvage their marriage. I mean, good that they're trying to work it out and all, but that's honestly so sad that that even happened at all--because it didn't have to happen. She could have used formula. She could have gotten sleep--that baby still wakes several times in the night to nurse--which also seems to be common amongst my breastfeeding friends. Lydia is only two months old and usually wakes up only once in the night--early morning, rather. And the one time she does wake up is getting later and later and I bet by next month she actually will be sleeping through the night. And when she does wake up, sometimes Gix feeds her rather than me. Making the choice to feed her strictly formula has made Gix and I completely equal parents in every respect, and it's working out wonderfully for us. There's no resentment whatsoever. The writer of that blog obviously has a lot of resentment for her husband--and it sounds like he has a lot of resentment too because he has to do all of the cooking and cleaning because she's spending all of her time nursing and pumping.

It's just sad. And for what? For all of those supposed breastfeeding benefits? Well, reading up on them, I've discovered two things about the, yes, definitely <i>supposed</i> benefits. Number one, any benefits are very slim. As a lot of preschool and kindergarten teachers seem to say about the issue online, it's impossible to look at their classrooms and pick out which ones were breastfed and which ones were formula fed. And number two, what benefits there are seem to be more a case of correlation than causation. Mothers who breastfeed, for example, tend to be better educated and have a higher income level, which of course is a far better explanation for their babies being healthier and doing better in school.

And since I have nowhere else to put this, I'll put it here--another benefit of breastfeeding that's always trumpeted is that it's amazing bonding experience. I have yet to be told exactly how having a living being sucking your tit makes the bonding so much better than anything else. I'm actually able to bond with Lydia better now that I'm feeding her formula, because I'm not stressing out about her getting enough, and I can also actually friggin' see her face (seriously, the people who tout being able to bond with their baby must have tiny boobs or something. My boobs are massive enough that I could barely see her when I breastfed her). Plus, Daddy can bond with her through feeding too! And her grandparents, and uncles, and even her eleven-year-old cousins! Mommy doesn't have a monopoly on baby time anymore! And I'm back at work now, and the thought of pumping multiple times during my work day is so unappealing I can't even.

What I'm trying to say is that while there's a lot of benefits to breastfeeding (again, can't knock that it's free--Lydia's going to put us in the poorhouse with how much formula she consumes), there's a lot of benefits to formula-feeding as well. And mothers who formula feed, whether through necessity or through choice, should not be made out to feel like they've failed. Mothers who are truly struggling breastfeeding, to the point where their child is actually losing weight, should NOT be told ""Just keep at it!"" No, they should be told, ""There's nothing wrong with formula, FEED YOUR DAMN KID.""

But breastfeeding is like... a religion to some women, or something. Look at that blogger's photos. The mother and child ones are nice and all, but there's always a couple of the mother breastfeeding her child. Okay, nothing wrong with that per se, don't get me wrong. Again, I'm not a prude who's offended by seeing a mother nurse her baby--like I said, that's what the boobs are there for. But... why would you get a photo--a professional photo, none the less--of you doing it? Do they also want a professional photo of them bathing their child? Or changing their diaper? Or any of the other normal, day-to-day things that parents do to care for their infant? Should I get a professional photograph of me feeding Lydia a bottle of formula? Or, for the true analogy of why I think it's weird, would these mothers get a professional photograph of themselves eating a hamburger or salad or something? Unless if they're a food critic or something... why? We all know you eat. We really don't need a $300 photo shoot memorializing the fact that you get nourishment.

Let's be honest here--those shots aren't really about the baby. Again, you can't even really see the baby's face in them--there's a boob in the way. They're about the boob. They're about the mother. I get such an uncomfortable, smug feeling from them, like they're saying ""yeah, look at me feeding my baby <i>the right way</i>."" Is this judgmental of me? Yes, probably, and I'm probably a bad person for thinking it, but all of my baby materials rubbing the exact same message in my face is still making me think there's probably a kernel of truth in my gut reaction.

I cannot imagine being so smug. I cannot imagine being reduced to my boobs. Back to that blog again--she wrote an entry where she admits that her daughter thinks her BOOB'S name is Mama, not her mama herself. I don't know if it was supposed to be cute or what, and she seemed to write it off as something funny, but again, I just felt so <i>bad</i> for her reading that! Your child cares more about your friggin' tit than you as a person? Again, I get it's a baby, but... damn! Maybe she thinks it's cute, but no way in hell am I going to let any baby of mine build a better relationship with my jugs than with me.

(I'm running out of different ways to write breasts.)

Am I wrong for not understanding that? Am I wrong for still wanting an identity outside of my daughter? Many mom-bloggers would say yes, that I'm a terrible mother for formula-feeding and going back to work full-time when Lydia was six weeks old and actually--gasp--ENJOYING going back to work and not feeling any guilt for leaving my baby at daycare.

I felt well-rounded and complete before I had Lydia--before I even got pregnant, to be honest. I knew who I was and the thought of losing all of that terrified me. Thankfully, it hasn't happened. Sure, my life's a lot different now--I have a baby, after all. Even though she's a very easy-going baby, she still requires a lot of care. I also love the bejesezus out of her. 

<img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/commander30/2624764/2203/2203_900.jpg"">

She's also super adorable, but I admit that I'm completely biased. ;)

But I'm still me. I'm still that dork who loves cartoons and American history and blasts the classic rock radio station in the car when Lydia's not in it (I turn the volume down a bit when she is--gotta expose her to awesome music early!), who likes alone time and still makes time to cuddle with her husband every now and then. Lydia added to my life. She didn't <i>take over</i> my life. And yes, I actually DID know what real love is before I had her. I love my husband. I love my parents. I love my brothers and aunts and uncles and I loved my grandparents when they were still alive.

When I married Gix, I had two eight-year-old nieces and a six-year-old stepson. Well, I obviously still have two nieces and a stepson, but the nieces are now eleven and the stepson's nearly ten.

I remember the day my nieces were born. I remember walking to my car in the parking lot after school that day, knowing that the C-section had been that afternoon, meeting up with my younger brother and the two of us just saying ""Well...!"" knowing that we were now an aunt and uncle, and driving us home and coming it to hear my mom proclaim ""Come see pictures of your nieces!"" and ushering us straight to the computer to show us the pictures she had taken on her new digital camera (bought two days before, I wonder why lolololol). I remember going to the hospital that night to see them and holding them both at the same time, one in each arm, and they were so tiny and sweet, and I loved them. I still love them. They drive me crazy sometimes, they're wacky and silly and sometimes loud but they're also super sweet and funny young ladies and I'm amazed at how much they've grown. (They're in middle school this year. MIDDLE SCHOOL!)

Obviously I don't remember my stepson being born. When I first met him, he was about four and a half years old. I remember my first time really hanging out with him later that summer when his dad asked me if I wanted to see Toy Story 3 with them, and I thought why not, I hadn't seen it yet, and we grabbed lunch beforehand and the kid kept climbing over to my side of the booth and playing with my food and his dad apologized and I was all ""no big deal, I have two nieces, I'm used to it"" and inwardly thinking ""no really, I'm glad you brought your kid along, otherwise this would feel waaaaaaaay too much like a date"" (lololol hilarious in retrospect irony lololol). I remember about a year and a half later, when Gix and I had just gotten engaged and his son was with us for Christmas, when I was feeling stressed out watching this kid but then he showed up with a star he had made and cut out from paper that said ""Katie you are nice to me"" and gave it to me along with some candy and a big hug. I remember that summer right before we got married when he came down with something and got sick while I was watching him, and panicking and calling my fiance because I didn't know what to do for him and I couldn't stand seeing him in so much pain. When marrying a parent, the only thing that can be realistically expected from you is to accept their child(ren), but I got lucky and I love the crap out of my stepson, too. Sure, he's sometimes a brat and always leaves his room a friggin' mess, but he's caring and helpful deep down and silly and fun and super smart.

Do I love my daughter any less than those three? Of course not. Do I love her any <i>more</i> than those three? ...No, I don't think so. Different kind of love for all of them, obviously, but I think the amount is the same. She's my daughter. I love her, obviously. But she doesn't have a monopoly on my emotions.

Too many mothers make motherhood out to BE a monopoly of emotions, though. They wrap themselves up way too much in their children and make the whole prospect of parenting seem unenjoyable to people like me who actually, you know, had a life pre-baby. They're all about motherhood to the point where they seem to care more about the concept of motherhood than their actual children as individuals. (Wasn't that one of the issues discussed in the Breaking Dawn sporking on das_sporking?)

I know this entry is long, but not many people read my lj anyway, lol, and that leads me to my next beef--the way these mothers are regarding their childbirth. Looking back through this blogger's entries, I hated to stereotype, but I thought ""I bet this is the mother who had a specific birth plan and insisted on a totally natural childbirth."" Ding ding ding, what do I win? Again, her birthing experience seemed absolutely horrible. She was pushing for six hours. SIX! I pushed for barely over an hour and that was still like an hour too long for my liking lol. And I had an epidural. Obviously her baby was born just fine, but if you're pushing for that long and they still can't even see the head, the baby's probably in distress. So many women seem to want their picture-perfect childbirth and ignore doctor's recommendations that are made for the good of the mother and the BABY. They care more about their experience than the end product. When I was brought into the hospital to be induced, the nurse asked me if I had a birth plan and I told her ""my plan is to have the baby"" and she told me ""good answer"". To me, giving birth (and pregnancy in general) was a means to an end. I was much more concerned with just having a healthy baby than with having everything ""just right"", and you know, I actually fucking trust medical professionals to make the best choices to insure our care.

(sigh) I could go on and on... but... rant over, I guess. If you made it this far, firstly, wtf, and secondly, thanks for reading my rantings lol."

Now that I have a new baby they'd probably be slightly different, so here goes... 1. to be able to buy the house we want (we've hit a slight snag), 2. that she has a healthy and happy life, and 3... probably the hair thing again for me.

"event","I met with the diabetes educators/professionals today. The first one I met with was the dietician. I think the second one was an actual doctor, although I'm not sure (she seemed young... younger than me, although I know getting an MD would still be possible). Anyway, they both told me that I'm managing my GD really well. The dietician told me I need to basically stop eating pasta, and limit how much milk I drink (boo) but said I was was pretty well on-track for everything else. And a bonus--she actually told me to snack MORE. I told her I've been eating about every three to four hours because I get pretty cranky if I don't, and she actually told me to add in another snack time. Plus, I can have--and am in fact encouraged to have--things like crackers, peanut butter, and cheese for snacks. Like, for ALL my snacks. SCORE! The other person gave me some pointers with my meter and how to check my blood sugar, and told me to work in physical activity every day, but I only need like twenty to thirty minutes per day, which is definitely doable. In fact, it doesn't even need to be all at once, which makes it even easier. (Plus I've been wanting to get in more workouts anyway.) And the best thing? I actually LOST two or three pounds since my last OB appointment a week and a half ago. I've already gained thirty pounds during this pregnancy, and I was way heavier than I wanted to be even before I got pregnant, so I wasn't wanting to gain much more weight, if any. Hopefully I can stay at this weight and the only one actually gaining weight is behbeh.

Speaking of behbeh, I had my OB appointment and ultrasound right after meeting with the diabetes folks. I was surprised to find out at the ultrasound that not only is the baby in a head-down position (I was still convinced she was transverse, aka horizontal), but she's at about an average weight for her gestational age. In her case right now, five and a half pounds or so. So she's doing really well. My OB told me that my amniotic fluid is a bit on the low side (well, the low side of okay levels) so she's going to be keeping an eye on that. I get another ultrasound in two weeks, I need to continue keeping track of my blood sugar four times a day still, and after that appointment I'll have to start coming in twice a week for ""stress tests"". But we're both looking to be in pretty good shape.

Oh, and the husband is picking up the stepson (well, his son, my stepson, you know) on Sunday and then he'll be with us until August! So he'll get to meet his little sister pretty much as soon as she's born. :)

Anyway, I'll probably have another snack soon and then go to the fitness room to get about a half an hour's workout on the treadmill. Then... I dunno. But there will be another snack later in on the night. ;)"

"event","So the month of May has really sucked and I'm glad to see it go in a few days.

(This is a complaining post, if you couldn't tell... feel free to ignore if you don't want to read bitching and whining.)

About three weeks ago, Gix got in a car accident. He was unhurt, but the car was more or less totaled. For about a week after that, we had only one car (mine), which meant that I was driving him to work, then going to work myself, then going to pick him up after I got off work, then driving him all the way to his musical rehearsal, then dicking around for the two hours or so he was in rehearsal, then driving us home. This whole process went from about 7 AM to roughly 8:30 or 9 PM. If any of you are remotely familiar with the Omaha metro area, you'll know by me saying that Gix works in Bellevue and his rehearsals are in Elkhorn that I was driving and driving a LOT, pretty much in a big loop around town every day. (They're pretty much on opposite ends of town.) Only a week of doing so pretty much was killing me. I was exhausted, nothing at home was getting done, and I very quickly ran out of things to do during his rehearsals (if I had gone home, I pretty much would have been home for half an hour then turned around and gone right back to pick him up). My older brother let Gix borrow his car, which seriously, we owe him one. <i>I</i> owe him one, because I seriously could not have kept that up any longer.

Anyway... we finally got Gix's car back tonight, but pretty much two minutes after driving it out of the insurance service center, the check engine light came on saying to check the emissions. (facepalm) Gix called the dealer and it's probably nothing, but he'll still probably have to bring it in on Monday just in case. Which means I get to drive him around again, since we're bringing my brother's car back to him on Sunday. With Gix's musical rehearsal schedule, it's pretty much the best time to do it.

As for me. I took a standard glucose tolerance test at my OB appointment a few weeks ago to check for the likelihood of gestational diabetes. My first test showed high glucose levels, so I had to take a longer one on Wednesday. Got the results yesterday... and they were also high. Which means I have gestational diabetes.

FML.

I went to the store tonight to buy foods that I can, you know, actually eat, and it's hardly ANYTHING. I mean, knowing what I previously knew about diabetes, I just thought ""oh, well okay then, I'll have to cut out sugar, but that's okay since I don't really eat or drink a lot of sweet stuff."" Oh no. I have to cut carbs as well. CARBS. That's pretty much all I eat. Sandwiches, pasta, potatoes... From what I read online, I'm allowed 45-60 grams of carbs a day, which seems like a lot, but it's really not. Like, at all. I'm already at 56 and I'm still hungry and let me tell you, pretty much every food on EARTH has at least some carbs in it. I'm not just hungry. I'm HANGRY. Like all I want is a slice of pizza or a big bacon cheeseburger or even some spaghetti but NO, no can do! I was excited to see that I can drink milk, but then I saw a serving of milk has eleven grams of carbs. ELEVEN! I have one glass of milk right now and I've already pushed myself over the limit. SHIT GODDAMN FUCK ALL I WANT IS SOME GODDAMN MILK IS THAT TOO MUCH TO FUCKING ASK?!

(And yes, it's skim milk.)

Sorry about the swearing. ^^; I'm just super pissed that this happened. I had absolutely none of the risk factors for developing gestational diabetes, and like I said I don't even eat a ton of sweets anyway, so I have no clue how this happened rather than just rotten luck. And all the carbs, I suppose.

The good news is that the diabetes should hopefully go away after I've given birth. Also, another weird thing of good news... and good news that I probably shouldn't consider good news... but I've read that when a mother has gestational diabetes, they often like to do an induction or C-section between 37-39 weeks, because of the risk of having a bigger baby. I'm at 33 weeks right now, and let me tell you, I am SO OVER being pregnant. I'm not even really having a difficult pregnancy (besides, you know, the diabetes and all) and I'm still miserable. I hate not being able to easily get up out of bed and stand up from chairs, I hate moving so slowly and still getting winded from walking any sort of distance, I hate not being able to get comfortable when I'm trying to sleep, I hate not being able to drink, and now I hate not being able to actually eat stuff that's more than just fruits or a salad or grilled chicken. And if anyone says ""stop complaining about being pregnant, thousands of women would give anything to get pregnant"", then you can shove it. I understand to an extent. I miscarried last year. I can be happy to be having a baby while still hating the process it takes to actually get it into the world.

I'll be meeting with a nutritionist in about a week and a half. Hopefully he or she will tell me I can eat a little more than a ""normal"" diabetic can because of being pregnant and all. Then I have another OB appointment, with an untrasound (another perk of having GD, I suppose) so we can see how baby's doing and how big she is.

Oh, and speaking of that and bringing me back to the possible early induction/C-section... this diagnosis has just made me feel like it's even more likely that I'll have a C-section. Ever since I've started feeling this baby move inside of me, every movement has been very, very low. I would say that I haven't felt anything past my bellybutton level, but even that's a lie, because I don't think I've felt anything even <i>that</i> high. At my appointment a few weeks ago I mentioned this to my OB, who felt my (big, protruding) bump and told me ""yep, she's lying in there horizontally"". She told me that the baby still had a few weeks to move, but having felt no change so far and the fact that she seems to like that position, I highly doubt she will by this point. And if she's in that position, then a C-section is pretty much necessary. And while I know that's a major surgery and all... I was/am so dreading labor and all of the variables that go into it that I'm almost relieved to know that this baby will most likely be sliced out of me in a process that only takes around 45 minutes (and one I'll have at least a little bit of advanced notice of, so I'll have a few days to prepare). Granted, I'm getting ahead of myself, since I don't know whether or not I'll be giving birth vaginally yet at this point, but with the horizontal position plus the diabetes, I'm thinking right now it's pretty unlikely. But we'll probably have a better idea at my upcoming ultrasound.

Sorry for the rant. I needed to get this off of my chest. I've been stressed out and feeling like I'm near my breaking point for awhile now. Let's just hope June will be better. And who knows... maybe the last week of June I'll already be holding my daughter?"

A new review has been posted to your story.

Story: I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight
Chapter: 1. Chapter 1

From: sarah (Guest)
-------------------

sarah:who ever wrote this story is a psychopath there is an immense amount of disgusting language in this story
there is no way I will ever believe this actually happened in the princess and the frog (never in a million years) this story could have been good if you removed the swearing and the inappropriate language I understand that Naveen is a playboy and I don't think he is a virgin as he has dated thousands of women but I am sure there is a much more decent way you could have written this in your story. Tiana is the total opposite of who she portrays in your weird story frankly she is persistent and motivated (decent)your so repulsive and obnoxious . show compassion if a little child were to find this it would have definitely corrupted there innocent vulnerable mind (you know exactly what this means) my dad is a police officer and I could have told him about this so he can track whoever has done this</i>

ROFLMAO!!

There's things I could say to this, but... uh, I've said it all before in response to reviews like this, so really all I have right now is laughter. Thanks for the laugh, Sarah!

Although I've never been threatened to have the police sent after me. I guess that is a new one. brb lolling forever XD

(I'm at my parents' right now. Our neighbors/very-very-very-longtime-friends-of-the-family (they practically are family by now) are throwing me a baby shower this afternoon. Not to be greedy, but I'm looking forward to presents. Hooray for getting baby stuff that I don't have to pay for! (And then I can go ahead and buy the rest of the things I need and finally start getting the apartment ready for behbeh. Yay.)) :)"

"event","I'm posting... about Sims! OMG! It's like I'm legacy playing again (even though I'm not). :P

I'm actually posting because I had a very, very weird glitch in my Sims 3 game happen last night. I had a pregnant Sim who hadn't had any fertility treatments or watched the kids channel/listened to kids music.

She had QUADS.

I know, that's not actually in the game coding. I'm sure I had a glitch that had one (or two, or three) extra babies pop out before the glitch stopped. I remember reading a Sims 2 legacy back in the day where the mother had six babies at a time, but that was a documented glitch of the mother just getting stuck in the pregnancy animation basically and to stop the flow of babies the Sim had to be reset, as I recall. But no resetting here... it was just like triplets being born, and then OMG FOURTH KID.

I got them up to kids last night, because I didn't want to deal with four babies/toddlers any longer than I have to. Actually, all these years of simming has made me kind of a pro at raising Sim kids. (Real-life kids, the jury's still out on that one... the one I'm growing right now will be an unfortunate guinea pig, lol.) I did age them from babies to toddlers pretty quickly, and aged them to kids once all four of them had learned to walk, talk, and gotten potty-trained... but I actually managed it pretty well. I even kept the parents in pretty good moods throughout it all as well. It helps that one of them had only a part-time job and the other had a work-at-home profession.

Actually, you know who the dad was? Remember my legacy? The dad's Calvin! When I moved into the neighborhood and my Sim met Calvin I just couldn't resist to have him in my game again, lol. And I figured out something interesting about his genetics, too. When playing the Sexsmith legacy, most of the kids had weird eye colors, which I attributed to Commie's yellow eyes... but of the quads, two of them had those weird red eyes, despite having a blonde, brown-eyed mother. I even got weird hair colors this time--only one of the quads inherited their mother's blonde hair. The rest got this... I don't know how to describe it. Super light red? Almost pink? Yeah, really, their hair is nearly pink. It's totally bizarre. All I can figure is that Calvin just has bizarre genetics hiding behind a seemingly ordinary exterior.

The land of The Sims 3... always an interesting ride. :D

<sub>(If you're wondering if I have Sims 4, Gix did buy it and I've tinkered around with it a bit on his computer. While it's not as bad as I thought it would be, I still... was not impressed. Even Gix, who does like it better than 3, has described it as being a ""dumbed-down"" version of the game. With a few exceptions, it's an overall dull experience playing it, and totally not worth the $60 it's going for. $20, maybe. Maybe. But definitely not $60. I'm just glad Gix is the one who spent money on it and actually sort of likes it, lol.)</sub>"

I have no plans to be job-hunting again for quite some time.) :P Another thing of note to mention, and I didn&#39;t really mention these at the time, but I am finally completely financially independent of my parents. At the start of the year I was still on their phone plan and they payed for my car insurance, but in June I had to get a new phone and just started my own plan at the same time, and in July my parents gifted me my car (it&#39;s over ten years old so it was essentially just them giving me the title) and... well, I&#39;m on Gix&#39;s car insurance now, but spouse and not parents this time. My parents no longer pay for anything of mine anymore. I can now be fully considered an adult. Only took me nearly twenty-eight years, lol.</span>

"event","So... after that very productive week or so I had a bit ago, I... haven't really written anything since then. ^^; I've been a bit under the weather lately, though, and also quite busy.

But that doesn't mean that I haven't completely forgotten about fanfic yet again. In fact, I've revisited a few older fanfics of mine. And one, one of my most, ahem, infamous fics, I thought deserved a look back.

Oh, you all know what it is! :D

<img src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y196/Commander30/library2/mojo_blossom_clipping__1_by_hikyu-d752lal_zpsd4f345df.png"">

(this is apparently a legit thing that is legit ahem ANYWAY)

So here we are, eight years after the fact, taking a look back at the one and only <a href=""https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3279848/1/Refugee"">Refugee</a>!

<lj-cut text=""Anyone ever wanted to read rambles about my rambly writing? Look no further!"">I guess I'll start off the title. Refugee was named, like so many other fanfics of mine, in desperation because I couldn't think of a better title. Actually, I had the most perfect title in the world for it: ""Damned If I Do"", from the Alan Parsons Project song of the same name. Here, take a listen:

<lj-embed id=""177""/>

The song fits their relationship in my fic absolutely perfectly, and in another dimension the fic probably would have been called ""Damned If I Do"". But ff.net had (and I assume still has) a rule in place that the summaries and titles need to stay G-rated. I didn't want to risk getting my fic deleted and myself possibly banned from the site because of the (absolutely perfect) title, so I had to make do with just making it the title of chapter five instead. (Loophole abuse; I don't recall any rules regarding the titles of the <i>chapters</i>.) ;)

Anyway, I had a decent-sized playlist on my iTunes of Mojo/Blossom songs to listen to while writing, and basically for lack of any better ideas, I pulled the name from a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song.

<lj-embed id=""178""/>

(would you look at all of those glorious seventies hairstyles in this video?! what a goldmine unf)

The song, and title, fits... sort of. It's not a great match. But I will admit that every time I hear this song on the radio (which is fairly often; the classic rock station I listen to seems to quite like Tom Petty), I always think back to Mojo/Blossom. :)

Now, as for the story itself.

This is... kind of hard to write from a ""here's what I was thinking"" standpoint, because, in some ways, I feel very detached from this fic. Not in the fact that I don't care about it, but more in the fact that I <i>have no idea where half of the ideas came from</i>. I think it's fair to say that the pairing's one of the tamest things about this story. The pairing's really only a side note in a lot of ways. A lot of the fic is about: Blossom's perfect memory superpower, and why it's a classic case of being Cursed with Awesome! What really happened when the Powerpuff Girls (and Mojo Jojo) were created! What the results <i>should</i> have been, and why they didn't actually turn out that way! What happens when Mojo becomes truly unhinged! What happens when Blossom reaches the end of her rope! What happens when Blossom's death is imminent and Mojo decides ""none of that shit, I want to be <i>directly responsible</i> for her death!"" And so on and so on.

Reading it now, I feel kind of bombarded by idea after dark idea after dark character study, over and over again. This fic really layers it on. Did I succeed in making all of those ideas cohesive and relevant? Eh... sort of. I wouldn't say this fic's a total failure or anything--in fact, I'm actually still able to read it without cringing (for the most part), which is more than can be said for pretty much every other fic I wrote around that time and even after (hell, some I haven't even been able to open and reread for years now because the simple <i>thought</i> of them embarrasses me to no end).

If I hadn't written Refugee, would I be able to write it now? I don't honestly know. Whatever state of mind I was in back then, I'm not sure I could get back there now. There are some things I'd definitely change, though.

1. The Girls' ages. I don't know if it was because I was only twenty myself when I wrote it, but for whatever reason I thought fifteen was plenty old enough. If I were to rewrite this story now I'd make them at the very least seventeen, probably eighteen (or older, if I decided to ditch the high school setting).
2. The one part where the school kids were making gossipy, crude assumptions of the PPGs' sex lives, and Buttercup got offended when one assumed that she and Blossom had a thing. I meant for that to show that Buttercup didn't care what others thought of her but did get defensive on her sisters' behalf, and also that ""just because we're close doesn't mean we're fucking; we're <i>sisters</i>"" <strike>although I have read some very good fanfics that are PPG incest, so even though it's not my cup of tea I can't protest too much</strike> It wasn't well handled in the story, though, and I can see why some readers thought it came across as homophobic. I'd probably just cut that part out entirely, since I could have gotten the idea of Buttercup being fiercely defensive when it came to her sisters shown in a much better way.
3. The whole ""Blossom can't hear Mojo's thoughts! Oh, now she suddenly can! Oh, now Mojo has the ability to hide some things from her because I said so! Oh, now Blossom can totally separate their minds because... BECAUSE!"" thing. If I was going to write a story about two characters basically sharing each others' minds, I needed to fully commit to it, and not go ""oh, but I need their thoughts to remain separate and private now! RESET!"" It was just plain lazy writing on my part. :/

However, I still feel relatively proud of this story despite all that, even if it's just in a mile-marker, turning-point kind of way. Despite some of the things I didn't fully commit to, I definitely <i>did</i> fully commit to the fact that I was writing a hero/villain story, especially remembering the villain part of that. Blossom's right in the fic; Mojo is pretty much psychotic in this. He's evil, entitled, possessive, sadistic, volatile, and self-serving; and I think one of this story's greatest strengths was that I was able to clearly show all of that, without any white-washing, while at the same time showing that Mojo really did, in his own twisted way, love Blossom.

Interestingly, though, this may be one of the major reasons why I <i>couldn't</i> write a story like this anymore, or at the very least have great difficulty in writing it. There's no beating around the bush here: Mojo and Blossom have a very abusive relationship in this story, mentally and emotionally if not physically (although there is some of that, too). And I am happy to say that even when I wrote this I was describing their relationship as completely messed up and definitely NOT something one should strive for. I mean, I killed them both off at the end; how more clearly could I state that their relationship was not ideal? I've become a lot more sensitive to abuse in stories, especially romanticized abuse, and while I don't think I quite crossed that line, I did play with it a lot. Again, I think I handled it pretty well, all things considered... and after all, when writing a hero/villain pairing, there's going to be a lot of dancing close to that line anyway. But I was definitely pushing the limits of how dark I could take this story.

For the record, if anyone's wondering this: yes, I still ship Mojo/Blossom. They're still one of my biggest OTPS. :D But, having said that, I'll admit that there's not a whole lot of ways to write a longer story of them actually embarking on a relationship. Given their personalities, even if there's a lot of unresolved attraction on either of their parts, I think one of the only ways these two would actually get together would be if Blossom had some problem that Mojo and only Mojo could help her with, or vice-versa. This is actually why I think Mojo/Bubbles is a lot easier to write in some ways (and why I find Bubbles so easy to ship with pretty much any other character); Bubbles is definitely more the type to readily admit an attraction and budding feelings and to pursue them. Blossom would definitely make denial more than just a river in Egypt. Mojo as well, although I think between the two of them, Blossom's the more emotionally stubborn. Just my thoughts, of course. :)

I'm not on Deviantart anymore, but I'm pleasantly surprised to see that there's a bit of Mojo/Blossom still around, and names I don't recognize saying that they ship it. (Of course, they're still totally outnumbered by PPG/RRB shippers, but what are ya gonna do?) There's a small amount of Mojo/Blossom fics on ff.net now, too, again some written by names I don't recognize from my more involved days in the fandom years ago. So it makes me happy. :) I'm not sure I'd actually want to see Mojo/Blossom become overly popular; I like the thrill of finding those hidden gems.

And finally, I feel like I can't discuss Refugee without discussing its importance in my fanfic writing ""career"" as a whole. This fic was in many ways wholly different from anything I'd ever written before. I've already mentioned how it (well, and its prequel, Hero Worship) were me really for the first time plunging into some really dark ideas and character studies, but Refugee stands out for other reasons, too. It was my first M-rated story. It was my first story that I actually sat down and wrote out completely before even starting to post it online, rather than posting chapters as I completed them. As a result, it became my first truly cohesive piece, since I was able to go through and edit earlier chapters to make them better flow into later ones if need be. It was my first flame, and then some. :P

Will I write more Mojo/Blossom? I don't know. I'd need to be struck with another idea first. If (and hopefully when) I write more PPG fanfic, it would probably be a sequel to Refugee, and obviously that wouldn't be Mojo/Blossom, since they're both dead as doornails. :P I do have a plot in mind, at least a beginning and an end, and I don't want to give away too much in case I do ever actually write/finish it, but I will say that Buttercup's mostly the main character, although Bubbles does come back and become very important to the story as well, and that Him is the main villain. And with Him being the villain, the threat is much more psychological than anything else. I'm not super good at writing those kinds of things, though (seriously, I'm envious of all of the writers who can write Him well; it's a talent I certainly lack), which is why the entire rising action part of the story is still very murky in my mind. I did actually start the story once, and have it stored in my email somewhere, although I barely got a thousand words in, and it was mostly just set-up. I do hope that someday, somehow, I can figure out that middle act and get it written and completed. :)</lj-cut>

Hopefully next time I update my LJ, it'll be with the finished one-shot (hopefully) that I'm working on right now. It's a pairing I've never written for before, but I have mentioned liking it in the past, and even drew some fanart for way back when. It's also not hero/villain (well... they're both kind of morally ambiguous characters, but they're generally considered protagonists, so whatever), AND they're both actually the same species! I know, what a concept for me, lol :P"

THIS

STORY</b>

Six chapters in seven years, that's just fucking pathetic. But until a few weeks ago, I didn't even think I'd ever finish it at all, so the fact that it's <b>FINALLY FUCKING FINISHED</b> is still enough for a BIG DAMN CELEBRATION!

(cough) I am still working on a few other things, plus my brain has sequels in mind for literally everything I've ever written (stop it, brain). Let's hope this productive week isn't just a fluke and is actually the start of me, you know, WRITING AGAIN!

"event","There are a few interesting tidbits about my life recently that some of you might find interesting.

Number one, I'm so distracted that I've been a forgetful dumbass all day. I forgot my flute at home when I left for work (I have band after work), I nearly left my water in my car when I did get to work, and when I filled up my car with gas after work, I discovered that I had forgotten to put both my driver's license and my credit card back in my billfold... four days ago.

Number two, I'm randomly moving a lot more, especially when sitting in front of a computer screen. I'm twitching more, I'm physically getting up and moving more, and sometimes I don't even notice it.

Number three, I've listened to music like this pretty much nonstop...

<lj-embed id=""167""/>

Others too, but this one in particular. As in, I've listened to it probably a hundred times in the past few days.

You all know what this means, right?

It means I'm writing again.

It means I'm writing <i>fanfic</i> again.

It means I'm writing <i>hero/villain fanfic</i> again.

I wasn't going to post about it because I don't want to jinx myself by talking about it and then never finishing it like what happened so many times in the past, but I've gotten so much in it already and I can't stop now and I can't stop thinking about this damn thing oh God help me God help you oh my fucking God

I'm back, bitches?

<lj-cut text=""crap, this got long"">A friend of mine (and Gix's) posted <a href=""http://thoughtcatalog.com/stacey-becker/2014/10/20-things-you-should-know-about-dating-an-independent-girl/"">this</a> to Facebook today. I read it and found myself nodding in absolute agreement with nearly every point, except for 15 (since that one did seem a bit entitled, for lack of a better word) and the ones that implied that all independent women (or people in general) are extroverted, which I am 100% not. Otherwise, though, I felt this article hit the nail completely on the head. It perfectly described my relationship with Gix, and in fact some of the points I have said nearly word-for-word to him regarding me.

Then I get to the comments.

Probably a good 90% of the comments are tearing apart the article and basically saying that women like this are horrible bitches who won't stay in any relationship she happens to be in anyway. Here, have a sample:

<i>""Lmao. Defend it all you want, but this is a cover for 15 ways to lose a boyfriend or significant other. Because believe it or not, a relationship isn't about /you/ and just what /you/ want. *drops mic*""

""I don't hear a very humble person in this article, instead I hear a lot of Narcism and bitterness. Which by the way will turn off not only men but everyone around you. Some of this is really bad advice, I just have to say. Ladies if you want to share your life with someone. It's human nature that the other person wants to feel needed, valued, or wanted. You might leave the other person pondering..if your so independent... Why not just date yourself?""

""Ew girls like this turn me off and have a bit of an ego problem. So basically, an ""independent"" woman is one who shuns her partner, wants to do everything herself, doesn't want him texting or spending time with her, is stubborn and does not take advice, hereby assuming she is smarter or better, does not wish to show affection and will be more turned on if you are a housekeeper? Ladies, feminists. . You might as well be a lesbian. Don't get me wrong the other extreme sucks, which is the golddigger type.. but you are sounding selfish and rude. Like the other guy said might as well date yourself.""

"" agree with many others, this sounds like a borderline feminist saying ""I want a man around when I need something specific or when I feel like it. Otherwise, I'd rather just be by myself.

I guess that means that the men should treat it like a business relationship instead of a romantic partnership. This is the same type of girl that would say ""you're just using me for pleasure"" or ""you only are with me when it's convenient."" I hope no one actually follows this advice.""

""An independent woman knows how to handle her life while having a man by her side. At the end of the day, this article just reflects how selfish women can be.""

""This is a great example of the fallout of feminism and how women are only screwing themselves over by making it too easy for men. I don't care how much $ I make. If a man doesn't pick up the check I would never see him again no matter how hot, interesting, smart he is. And if a man doesn't want to protect me, fix shit for me, fuck him he's not a man he's a useless boy.""</i>

And so on, and so on.

Now, if you happened to catch the LJ entry I posted a month or so ago before I made it private since it was angry and ranty (but oh God, was it cathartic), you'll know that I really hate the modern version of feminism. I hate that it assumes to speak for ALL women and that if you don't agree with them you're either a stupid man with male privilege or a brainwashed woman who secretly hates herself and that it seems to glorify being victimized. I hate it, hate it, hate it, and I've learned to just completely scroll past anything that mentions ""feminist"" anymore.

But after reading these comments... I'm about to go all burn-the-bras on them.

Seriously? How is any of this bad advice? It's not saying ""I don't care about you at all and I'm only dating you for convenience"" (again, with the possible exception of 15, which I think could have been worded a lot better or cut out entirely). Hell, the last two points directly contradict that thought, while none of the other points say anything like that. Why is it that a woman who wants to be reliable for herself, who wants to be in charge of her own well-being and doesn't need anyone else to take care of that for her, is now suddenly an egomaniac? Why is it that telling a boyfriend/husband/significant other that you're absolutely fine with them spending a day or evening with friends and away from you a bad thing?

When did a relationship with love and respect for each other's boundaries become the worst thing ever?

I'm not going to lie and say I'm the best wife--or best human being--in the world. I'm not. I've had my large share of fuck-ups in nearly every aspect of life, including my married life. And I'm not going to act like I'm some huge expert on dating or relationships. I didn't start dating until I was nearly twenty-five, and I went and married the guy, so he's the only person I've ever dated. And we've only been married for two years now, which isn't a huge amount of time in the grand scheme of things.

But I do know what is and what isn't respect. I do know that if you treat someone like they can't take care of themselves, there is going to be resentment.

I hope Gix doesn't mind if I talk in general about a few of his issues. When we first started dating he had plenty of hangups over what a man ""should"" and ""shouldn't"" do in a relationship, from a combination of his Catholic upbringing, the emotionally abusive relationships he was in before me, and just his own personality. I, however, expected for us to be on completely equal footing regarding everything. I told him the <i>very first day</i> we started dating that ""just because we're dating now, don't think that means you have to start buying dinner for me every time we go out. Sometimes you buy, sometimes I buy, okay?"" While I expect him to put his share of work into the apartment and cooking and cleaning and paying for things (we have separate bank accounts and I don't really want that to change), I wouldn't be saying that if I didn't expect an equal share from myself. I told him I didn't give a damn that ""the man should do/feel/be this"" or ""the woman should do/feel/be that"". We are both people. We are both equal. And we are both WHOLE people on our own and we BOTH have worth. There was a bit of friction between us at first because of my ""I don't need you to coddle me"" attitude and his ""but I am the MAN and the PROTECTOR and I MUST for it is my DUTY"" attitude, but I think that we're both far happier around each other when we take care of our own needs, and we each have the other around for help if it's needed.

I am an introvert, and I am a bit of a loner. I grew up in a big house and had my own room my entire life. When I went to college, I only had a roommate my freshman year--the rest of my time at college I was a resident assistant and had a room to myself. When I graduated college, I moved into an apartment with my friend Pam, but only about a month later she got a job four hours away and moved out, and I had that apartment all to myself until Gix and I started dating and he moved in. I am used to having my own space, and not only that, but I NEED to have my own space. I sometimes just need to be alone. And even when I don't ""need"" to be alone, I don't mind it. I know how to keep myself entertained and how to take care of myself. And I've certainly never been lonely--I actually can't think of a single time in my life where I've ever felt lonely before, ever. I may be introverted, but I do have friends and do enjoy their company, and seek them out if I need company, and if they seek me out needing company I'm there for them too. We don't need to be calling/texting/whatevering 24/7 to know that our friendships are for keeps.

And you know what, maybe this whole rant is more than just about romantic relationships. Maybe it's about relationships in general. Why is it that some people expect daily confirmation that the people who care about them still care, and why do people act like the lack of that is a bad thing and is somehow proof that you don't care? Some of my friends I haven't spoken to a while--and most of the ones that I do speak to on a semi-regular basis are through Facebook. My friend Pam who I mentioned above? She's in <i>Kuwait</i> right now. I'm definitely not going to be seeing her for at least a year, and I don't catch her online very often because of the time zone difference. But that's fine! I'm secure and confident enough in those friendships (and so are they) that I don't NEED for them to be constantly at my feet.

And the same goes with Gix. I don't ask anything of him that I don't expect from myself as well. When I say that I need my alone time, I recognize that, although he is far more needy and clingy than I am (he's getting better, though), he sometimes needs it too, and I'm fine with that. I leave him be. I have friends and interests outside of him and I pursue them. He has friends and interests outside of me, and he pursues those. (He's still sometimes baffled that I'm totally okay with him having supper with a female friend. lol yeah, I know, I actually trust my husband? wtf is this madness)

The thing I took away from this article is that the author is her own person, and wants to be treated as her own person, and she will do the same for her significant other. And I'm the same way. I'm my own person. I'm not my husband's ""better half"" and he's not my ""better half"" and we don't have a shared Facebook account (couples who do that... why?!) and we don't act like a single person. We're TWO people who care about each other and love each other and want to experience life together, but we're still different people with our own likes and dislikes and that's okay. We let each other be themselves. And that's a good thing, I think. Isn't that was truly loving a person is all about?

...all of those comments that say otherwise, and all of the upvotes they're getting, seem be saying that my viewpoint is the minority.

To that, all I have to say is... clinginess sucks. It's what's made my husband on more than one occasion freak and stress out over meeting a female friend for lunch, despite how many times I've told him that I'm fine with it. It's what contributed to me losing a friend here on LJ years ago because the fact that I didn't comment on every single one of her entries somehow convinced her that I didn't care about her and so she started fabricating issues just to get my attention. It's fucking <i>suffocating.</i> Codependency is not good for <i>either</i> member of <i>any</i> relationship. 

But hey, again... I guess on this issue, just like on every single other issue, I must be wrong. :/ I guess the way a woman shows her man that she loves him is by becoming completely dependent on him in every way. Welcome to the Twilight Generation.</lj-cut>

ugh man I'm sorry for how ranty and rambly that is and that all my LJ seems to be good for nowadays is rambling and Petz. Better than nothing though, right? :/"

So, guess what, LJ land? I&#39;m playing Petz again. ^^;

Right now, I&#39;ve been getting back into showing, and I thought I needed a place to keep track of my showing crew and their stats, and, well, a new LJ entry seemed to be the best place to do that. My current show team will be first, followed by my retired Supreme Grand Champions.

"event","Crossposted from my Facebook account, because after thinking it over, I realized that it applied here, too:

...

I feel like this is something I should throw out there regarding myself, since I've gotten involved in two debates already today and it's not even noon:

I actually hate to argue. Like I really, really DETEST it. I always feel like a horrible person anytime I state a viewpoint to someone that I know differs from theirs. The problem is, though, I see every side to every issue, and thus it's often really hard for me to form a firm opinion on anything. 

So if I do make a comment on something you post that brings up a different side, please don't take it as me disregarding your opinion. (Quite the contrary, in fact: chances are if I see a post that's 100% the other side, I may post a comment defending your side.) I just don't want to see ANY opinion disregarded, because almost every issue that I see debated, I can see merits on both sides of the coin.

I don't mean to stir the pot with my comments, and if I've ever said something that rattles you, I am sincerely sorry. Sometimes my comments rattle myself, to be honest. And for the record, seeing every side to nearly every issue sucks, because I often feel rattled and shaken every time I open my mouth. Just please know that if I ever debate something with you, it's not because I think that you or your opinion is stupid. I think you are all awesome people who come from such a wide range of life stories to all reach your own individual viewpoints, and I don't think any one of you is any more right or wrong than anyone else. :)

...

I guess it's been awhile since I've updated my LJ. Haven't had a whole lot to talk about--just been keeping busy with life these past few months. So consider this just my checking in and letting those of you reading this that I'm still alive and well. :)"

Mainly what I've wanted to update with is what I've been doing lately: Gix/Stenir/James and I have been doing a Let's Play. Or rather, he's been doing a Let's Play and I've been adding in my (usually inane) two cents. He's playing Kingdom Hearts, so I'm commenting on the Disney part of it. And to show you just how late I am at updating my LJ, we already have four episodes up!

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQOC6hcJLua-t3UA3kenPeJzvP6EX-Gg3

On the real-life front, I've just finished my first month at my new job and it's going great. What I'm doing is very similar to what I was doing at the libraries, so that's always a plus. Other than that... sleeping and Sims. That's about it. Whoo. I've become a boring adult. ^^;"

Well, I spotted all day yesterday, and this morning I awoke to basically a full-blown period. James took me to the ER. They did an ultrasound and, while they could see the baby (which I was expecting, since we'd had an ultrasound a few weeks ago and we saw it then and it was just fine), they couldn't find a heartbeat. It actually probably died just a few days or a week after my first appointment. 

Still waiting to hear back from the OB-GYN to set up an appointment with her and figure out if they're going to take it out or just let it come out on its own.

Oh, and I'm cramping now, too. I basically am having a period. A period in which a tiny little fetus is going to be discharged too. :(</lj-cut>"

"event","Three very major announcements, two good and one bad, that I'm putting behind LJ cuts because I'm an ass who loves to draw out the suspense! You can thank me later. :D

<lj-cut text=""First:"">First, I got a new job, and it's FULL-TIME! Starting February 3rd I'll be working at the city's civic center/government offices as a clerk. No, not a library job, but it'll pay around $18 an hour, I'll actually have evenings and weekends free (I can finally be in band again!), and, again, FULL-TIME. XD</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Second:"">Second, it's a good thing that I'll soon be making more money, because I'll be needing it...

<a href=""http://www.thebump.com/?utm_source=ticker&utm_medium=HTML&utm_campaign=tickers"" title=""Parenting Tips""><img src=""http://global.thebump.com/tickers/tt183b6a.aspx"" alt="" BabyFetus Ticker"" border=""0""  /></a>

Nervously excited about this development. :) I'm due September 4th, although I wouldn't be surprised if it hangs out inside of me past its due date, as both my older brother and I did the same thing to our mother.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Third:"">Third, the bad thing. My paternal grandmother, my last living grandparent, died today. Last summer she was on one of her usual world travel excursions when she got sick, and it turned out to be leukemia. At her age (81) it looked like curtains for her right then and there, but she responded well to chemo and seemingly kicked the cancer's ass, and she stuck around for Thanksgiving and Christmas (something we weren't expecting in the summer). But just this week it returned with a vengeance. Luckily, James and I were able to visit her last night and I was able to tell her about my new job. I was going to tell her about the pregnancy, too, but I guess my dad had told everyone back when I told my parents (New Year's Eve), so...</lj-cut>

So, in short, a lot of changes coming/already happening! I am still hoping to continue with Rush, however! Keeping my fingers crossed that I'm still able to get the updates out on a semi-regular schedule at least. :)"

"event","Sorry for the delay, everyone. Urgh holiday season and all. Anyhoo, on with the show.

<lj-cut text=""Chapters 4-6"">Chapter 4 starts with Mia asking the cab driver to drop her off at a park rather than her house, to avoid Caroline pressing her for details. It happens to be close to the pastry shop where she works.&nbsp; We find out that she got the job by just asking the owners of the shop, which she frequented, if they&#39;d needed extra help. The job <i><b>&quot;made her feel good that she wasn&#39;t completely dependent on Jace for her support. He&#39;d done enough for her over the years. She didn&#39;t want him worrying over her anymore.&quot;</b></i> Understandable and all, but getting a job at Jace&#39;s company won&#39;t really be a whole lot different than him outright providing for her, will it?

Well, Mia doesn&#39;t waste any time and gets right to what she wanted some space for in the first place--reading the contract! And Gabe wasn&#39;t kidding when he said he&#39;d own her--signing this would be <i><b>&quot;ceding all power to him&quot;</b></i>, making her time his while she works at the office, which are hours that he sets. And, of course, this covers the sexual side of their relationship as well: <i><b>&quot;Decisions were to be made by him. She was his to command.&quot;</b></i>

If that weren&#39;t troubling enough, the next paragraph is a doozy:

<div style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Perhaps most disturbing was that as detailed as the contract was, the actual description of what she may be required to do was vague because, in essence, everything was covered by the fact that she was to give him whatever whatever he wanted, whenever and however he wanted.</b></i></div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y196/Commander30/library2/tumblr_inline_msiuamBcfM1qz4rgp_zpsfec80f65.gif"" title="""" /></div><div>
OKAY OKAY BACK THIS SHIT UP.

If this is something that she&#39;s going to be signing and bound to, if not legally then acting as if it is legal, and details exactly what is going to be expected of her and what kinds of things he DOES want, IT REALLY SHOULDN&#39;T FUCKING BE VAGUE. I&#39;d happily sign a contract with my husband saying that I&#39;m required to do what he wants as long as &quot;what he wants&quot; is specified as &quot;watching cartoons and Disney movies with me and making perverted jokes&quot; because, heck yes, I did that enough on my own anyway, and look, I found someone&#39;s whose desires actually match up with mine! But you can&#39;t agree to a contract when you have no idea what &quot;what he wants&quot; even IS! What if he wants to hack off your limbs and eat you, Mia?!

Of course, Mia wants to know what she&#39;s getting out of this, and the contract does insure that all of her physical and financial needs will be met, but, Mia is smart enough to notice, <i><b>&quot;There was nothing at all about emotional needs.&quot; </b></i>Also, while Gabe has the right to break off the contract at any time, it says nothing about Mia having the same right. I&#39;m getting huge Christian Grey vibes here... wasn&#39;t his contract with Ana (which she never actually signed, anyway?) the same? &quot;If you fail to please me I can drop you at any time, but if you don&#39;t like it our relationship and want out, tough shit, you&#39;re stuck with me.&quot; AFHDFOSIHFDOISHFDSIFDHAHFDLKHFDLKFDH YOU FUCKFCAE.

Ahem. Okay. Like I said in the intro, I&#39;m pretty vanilla as far as this all goes, but it&#39;s my understanding that some couples do have a mutual, consensual master/slave style relationship (and let&#39;s be honest, that&#39;s exactly what Gabe wants from Mia). One some level, I can understand the &quot;wanting to be dominated&quot; bit. Perhaps a bit TMI here, but I like being dominated in the bedroom. But it&#39;s one thing to have the partner you know and trust just take you in a way he/she knows you both like. Having that same partner say &quot;we&#39;re doing things my way because I&#39;m the boss&quot; in everyday life and decisions is a TOTALLY different<i><b> </b></i>ballgame. And even being dominated in the bedroom, I know 100% that if I&#39;m ever uncomfortable with something or just want to stop, all I have to do is say that to Gix, and no matter how turned on and horny he is, <i>he&#39;ll stop! </i>And it goes the other way, too--if I&#39;m the one taking control (Gix likes being dominated just as much as I do, hence why we could never do a D/s relationship--we&#39;re both just too submissive, lol) and he tells me to stop, <i>I&#39;ll do it! </i>Why is this such a hard concept for romance authors to figure out?!

But we follow that with a revelation that actually pleasantly surprised me, namely... MIA IS NOT A VIRGIN. Holy shit. How many romances, erotic or no, actually feature a woman that has even a little first-hand knowledge about sex? In that regard, at least, Mia is no Ana! In fact, here&#39;s the paragraph:</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>She wasn&#39;t an idiot when it came to sex. She wasn&#39;t a virgin, and she&#39;d had steady boyfriends. But they were decidedly vanilla relationships, and she was fine with that. It had never occurred to her to break out the kink.</i></b></div><div>
Hell, I&#39;m fine with that too! ;) Nothing wrong with not having a desire for kink before now (especially not in the &quot;I OWN YOU&quot; sense that Gabe wants, because seriously wtf), but not only has she actually been intimate with a guy before, she&#39;s had more than one! So kudos to Maya Banks for not having the &quot;pure, innocent, virgin&quot; stereotype as the female lead, because seriously, that shit&#39;s getting old.

Mia reads through the rest of the contract, and it&#39;s about what you&#39;d expect, the same bullshit that Hellspawn Christian Grey himself detailed more or less--do not talk to outside sources about the relationship, a physical so both of them could make sure they were free of STDs (hey look! That actually includes Gabe! None of Christian Grey&#39;s &quot;Even though you&#39;ve never had sex before me, I still need you to get tested for STDs. But me with the dozens of women I&#39;ve shagged? I&#39;m clean. Don&#39;t you trust me. baby?&quot; (gags)), birth control is expected, yadda yadda. The only thing that&#39;s different is the stipulation that <i><b>&quot;condoms would only be provided in the event of interaction with another person who was not Gabe.&quot;</b></i> Well, thank goodness Ms. Banks isn&#39;t going to shy away from the idea of threesomes like ELJ seems to.

After reading the contact, Mia is shocked, but also enticed by the idea. And also enticed by the idea of playing psychologist:</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>She vaguely remembered the fallout of his divorce from Lisa, but that had been several years before, and she&#39;d been young. She knew it hadn&#39;t been pretty and that it had affected his relationships with women ever since, but had they had this kind of relationships? Had he been burned by it?</b></i></div><div>
If he&#39;d been burned by it, I highly doubt he&#39;d still be pursing relationships like this, Mia. Also? If you suspect &quot;hey, the guy I&#39;m interested in may have unresolved issues from his failed marriage?&quot;, don&#39;t think those aren&#39;t going to make things difficult in any type of relationship. Trust me... I love Gix, but he has a lot of baggage left over from his first marriage that I wasn&#39;t 100% aware of when I married him, and knowing it sooner rather than later to actually work on it would have been very, VERY helpful.

Also also? Remember that first sentence for later. :/

Mia realizes she now has to get to work, so she scuttles on over to the pastry shop. On her way over, she realizes that Jace presents a major monkey wrench in the whole affair: <i><b>There was no way she could ever let her brother know about this. It would ruin his friendship with Gabe and would likely ruin their business as well. Not to mention he would never understand, and it would put a huge wedge between her and Jace.</b></i> But I guess the feelings in their pants are more important than all of that, huh? :/

Mia arrives at work, and her bosses, Louisa and Greg, greet her in a friendly and parental manner. By parental I mean one of the first things Louisa asks is <i><b>&quot;Have you eaten?&quot;</b></i> OH GOD NOT THIS SHIT AGAIN. Christian&#39;s obsession with Ana&#39;s eating habits is one of the more rage-inducing things about Fifty Shades to me. I have a bit of a weak stomach and can&#39;t eat that much, especially in the morning. For the first hour or so after I wake up even the thought of food makes me nauseous. And it doesn&#39;t take much for me to feel full even later in the day. If someone hovered around me and told me &quot;You need to eat more!&quot; I&#39;d get really, REALLY pissed. True, it&#39;s not Mia&#39;s love interest doing it here, but it&#39;s still a major annoyance for me.

Anyhoo, Mia works straight through the lunch rush, too focused on her work to give the matter of Gabe that much thought. I&#39;m happy to see that although she&#39;s flustered by the notion, she&#39;s not so focused on Gabe that she&#39;s not able to do her job properly. She even has time to take a short break once the rush is over, and OH SHIT GABE JUST WALKED IN THE DOOR.</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y196/Commander30/library2/3xctjlb_zps212373dc.gif~original"" title="""" /></div><div>
CAN YOU LEAVE HER ALONE FOR EVEN FIVE <b>FUCKING</b> MINUTES YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT?!

And OF COURSE, Mia is so surprised that she trips and falls over and Gabe catches her. SHOOT ME NOW. :/ He says he&#39;s there to see her (well, at least he&#39;s honest) and then orders coffee from her. Mia continues to be not so stupid, and tells him she knows that he never comes there normally. After getting him his coffee and asking him again why he was really there, he responds <i><b>&quot;I wanted to see what my competition was.&quot;</b></i> For once the romantic lead in an erotic novel isn&#39;t talking about men but jobs. He then asks her <i><b>&quot;Is this really what you want?&quot;</b></i> and SERIOUSLY STOP TRYING TO MAKE HER DECISION YOURSELF, DICKHEAD! Mia tells him there&#39;s a lot in the contract to consider (understatement of the century) and that she needs to read the contract more thoroughly before she makes her decision, Gabe outright tells her to quit this job, and Mia points out that it wouldn&#39;t be fair to leave Louisa and Greg short-handed so suddenly. Gabe says he&#39;ll find them a replacement (what? Seriously, how? Is Gabe HR?) and continues to insist that the job is dead-end, she&#39;ll never get out of it, leave it and work for him, blah blah blah the same old shit. Mia tells him she&#39;ll consider it.

Then Gabe suddenly kisses her. DUDE WOULD YOU KNOCK THAT SHIT OFF ALREADY?! Jesus, I know they&#39;ve both admitted that they want each other, but she still hasn&#39;t agreed to being with you in any way, shape, or form! And doing this after A. unexpectedly showing up at her place of work, B. trying to convince her to quit her job so she can come work for you, and C. trying to convince her that where she&#39;s working now is the worst possible thing ever and a job with him would be SO much better, why wouldn&#39;t you consider it?!... and then kissing her. You know, making sure she can carefully consider her options and think straight. Fuck this piece of shit.

He then leaves, Mia awkwardly clears his table, and then gets ready to head out (her shifts are only a few hours each day). Greg sees that he&#39;s flustered, asks if there&#39;s anything wrong, and Mia tells him, <i><b>&quot;There&#39;s something I need to tell you and Louisa.&quot;</b></i>

And on that bombshell, chapter 4 ends and chapter 5 begins with Mia back at home, Caroline yelling in surprise <i><b>&quot;Holy shit, you quit?&quot;</b></i> Couldn&#39;t have put it better myself. Although like it was impossible to see that coming or anything. :/ Caroline demands to know why, and Mia reluctantly admits that Gabe offered her a job, although she spares the details of what all the job entails, including everything about the contract. Caroline doesn&#39;t completely buy it, remembering that this came on the heals of him hissing her at the party and saying he wanted to fuck her brains out, and realizing that her job title of &quot;personal assistant&quot; <b><i>&quot;gives a whole new definition to the word</i> personal.&quot;</b> Caroline figures that Mia&#39;s already made her decision to work for Gabe, but Mia tells her that she&#39;s still considering it. Wait a minute, what? Why did she quit her job unless she was damn certain she had another one lined up? And going back to what she said earlier, it&#39;s pretty shitty of her to quit outright, without even a two-weeks&#39; notice, simply on the basis of &quot;I need to <i>consider </i>this job offer.&quot; If it was &quot;I&#39;ve unexpectedly been offered a new job and I&#39;ve accepted&quot; that would be one thing, but Mia hasn&#39;t even accepted yet! Which makes her quitting even more stupid. What&#39;s she going to do if she declines Gabe&#39;s offer? Then she&#39;s totally out of a job!

Of course, we all know she&#39;s going to accept it. :/

Caroline tells Mia <i><b>&quot;Its a no-brainer if you ask me. He&#39;s rich, he&#39;s gorgeous and he wants you. Whats not to love about that setup?&quot;</b></i> Because money and looks are all that matter, amirite? Mia points out that money isn&#39;t everything, and Caroline tells her that that&#39;s easy for her to say with a brother as rich as Jace is. When you consider that, actually, Mia abruptly quitting her job makes a bit more sense. Yes, she mostly supports herself and doesn&#39;t like leaning on Jace for handouts, but he&#39;s a constant safety net for her, giving her the option to make rash decisions that, let&#39;s be honest, most of us couldn&#39;t afford.

Mia and Caroline talk more about men, and we get a description on Caroline:</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i><b>Caroline was gorgeous. Only a little taller than Mia, she was way curvier with a lushness to her figure that attracted men like flies. She had beautiful burnt-auburn hair that had varying shades of red and gold under sunlight. Add rich brown eyes that twinkled with warmth and the result was a beautiful woman with a sunny personality that endeared her to everyone she met.</b></i></div><div>
Jesus, Mia, hook up with Caroline already. ^^;

We then find out that Caroline&#39;s last romantic endeavor had ended badly, which we do find out more about later.

Scene break, and we join Gabe in his office, getting a phone call from his mother. She immediately gives him crap for being at the office so much, telling him he should take a vacation, and of course Gabe immediately starts to think about taking Mia with him. Sexy, erotic travel locales in his future? Thankfully, he doesn&#39;t say anything of that to her, instead making the mistake of asking his mother how she was. His mother immediately starts to complain about Gabe&#39;s father. Although she has very good reason to, it sounds like:</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i><b>After nearly forty years of marriage, his father had moved out, served his mother with divorce papers and seemed determined to run through as many newer, younger models as quickly as possible. His mother wasn&#39;t taking it well, as could be expected. And unfortunately, Gabe was her sounding board.</b></i></div><div>
May I present Subplot &quot;Gabe&#39;s Father is Having a Midlife Crisis.&quot; And I must say, I love the short, succinct way Gabe sums up the situation: <i><b>&quot;He loved his father, but he was being a huge dick.&quot;</b></i> Very short and sweet and to the point. I like it. :)

But then he uses his parents&#39; divorce to yet again muse on his own divorce, which I don&#39;t like.</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i><b>He wasn&#39;t certain that he would have gotten to the point of asking Lisa for a divorce. She&#39;d been the one to leave him. It may not have been the right thing to do, remain in a relationships where it was obvious there was no love or true affection any longer, but he would have spared her the pain and humiliation of a divorce. She, however, didn&#39;t feel the same about sparing him. And he didn&#39;t hold the divorce against her. Maybe he should have done something before allowing it to get to the point it had. But he hadn&#39;t realized that Lisa was so desperately unhappy. What he held against her was the way she went about divorcing him.</b></i></div><div>
Okay... a couple of things. First off, if it got to the point that it was &quot;obvious&quot; there was no love or affection left, then yes, a divorce WOULD have been the right thing to do! The current divorce rate is around 50%... it&#39;s not exactly stigmatized anymore. It&#39;s pretty common! And having never been divorced myself but knowing a number of people who have (most notably my mother and my husband), I&#39;m not going to lie and say that divorce doesn&#39;t suck, but it doesn&#39;t have to be painful and humiliating! And secondly, how far was your head up your ass to not realize how unhappy your wife was right up to the time she divorced you? Way to make your male lead sound attentive and caring! If he was so tuned out to his own wife, why should I believe he&#39;ll be any better with a contractual fuck-buddy?

Anyhoo, back to the story. Gabe tries to comfort his mom and tells her that she should get at more, enjoy life, try to find a new man of her own, but his mom says she&#39;s not ready to move on. So far, Gabe&#39;s mom is the most sympathetic character in this whole situation. Gabe offers to take her out to dinner, under the hopes of giving her a &quot;fresh start.&quot;

After finishing the call with his mother, Gabe again reflects on marriage and divorce, although this time in general: <i><b>&quot;More and more he was beginning to realize that no marriage was safe. Divorce could happen to anyone. There was certainly the argument to be had for not setting yourself up for the emotional upheaval of a breakup. And definitely one to be had for protecting yourself from taking a huge financial hit. Divorces were a hell of a lot more expensive than relationships.&quot;</b></i> Well jeez, I&#39;m sure glad my mom didn&#39;t have that mindset after her divorce that would have made her completely avoid my dad or anyone else. And I&#39;m glad that my husband--who had a FAR worse marriage/divorce than you, Gabe, since his ex-spouse was physically and emotionally abusive and the fact that there was a kid involved made their divorce about a thousand times more complicated--didn&#39;t have that bleak mindset either. Although I do have to agree with that last sentence. It&#39;s ridiculously easy to get married. If you&#39;re the right ages/genders for your state/jurisdiction, you can walk in and out of the courthouse within minutes and get married for only about ten to twenty bucks. Divorces? They&#39;re a LOT more time consuming. And a LOT more expensive.

Since I&#39;m actually nodding my head in agreement with something, though, Ms. Banks decides to fully piss me off again: <i><b>&quot;He glanced down at his phone and pulled up the photo he&#39;d taken of Mia just a few weeks earlier. She hadn&#39;t even known he&#39;d taken the picture. She&#39;d never seen seen him, never known he was there.&quot;</b></i>

<lj-embed id=""166"" />

<div style=""text-align: left;"">
...I&#39;m scared. O_o

We finish the chapter out with Gabe&#39;s internal monologue at how much he wants Mia, how he NEEDS to have her, how he&#39;ll <i><b>&quot;do whatever it took to possess her&quot;</b></i>, and I&#39;ll spare you. You&#39;re welcome. (shudders)

Chapter six begins where the prologue left off, so we&#39;re officially back in &quot;present time&quot;. It&#39;s Monday morning, and Mia&#39;s at Gabe&#39;s office. After getting out the initial awkwardness, they both sit on the same couch and Gabe puts Mia&#39;s hands into his lap (trying to get a handjob already?) and tells her this: <i><b>&quot;I dont want you to be nervous or afraid of me, Mia. That&#39;s not my intention at all. I gave you a very detailed outline of what our relationship will be to allay any fears or confusion.&quot;</b></i> Well, he&#39;s already made ME afraid of him. O_o Also, like hell you&#39;re given her a detailed outline! All your outline details is &quot;you&#39;ll do whatever I want&quot;. That could be ANYTHING! How could she be anything BUT confused right now?

Urgh. Mia doesn&#39;t pussyfoot around, getting straight to the point by telling him that she trusts him and intends to accept the arrangement, under certain conditions. Let&#39;s see how well Gabe compromises!

He responds with <i><b>&quot;Do you now?&quot;</b></i> and Mia, determined to stand firm, doesn&#39;t want to be <i><b>&quot;some spineless twit who chose to cower rather than to speak her mind.&quot;</b></i> It&#39;s lines like this (and there will be many more similar ones following) that make me suspect this was written in response to a lot of the criticisms of Fifty Shades... which would be a lot more appreciated if the male lead still wasn&#39;t as much of a douchebag as Christian Grey is. Anyway, Mia tells Gabe that the clause about birth control and condoms bothers her, and Gabe immediately jumps in with assuming she&#39;s not able to take birth control, and even though condoms aren&#39;t his preference he&#39;d use them to keep her safe. Mia tells him <i><b>&quot;Let me finish&quot;</b></i>--you go girl!--and specifies that the part of that clause she&#39;s uncomfortable with is being &quot;loaned out&quot; to others and tells him that it rather freaks her out and would like the right to refuse that. Gabe tells her that the contract <i><b>&quot;is a little misleading in that it states I&#39;m given all power and complete and utter control over you&quot;</b></i> (if it&#39;s misleading, then rewrite the contract, dumbass!) and gives her the &quot;you actually have all the power and I won&#39;t do anything you&#39;re even a bit uncomfortable with&quot; schpeel. Christian Grey said the same thing, remember, and then completely ignored any of Ana&#39;s misgivings... so you&#39;d better actually follow through on that, Gabe.

Mia tells him that she still has other misgivings, specifically the fact that there&#39;s no safe word mentioned in the contract. This is Gabe&#39;s response: <i><b>&quot;There is no mention of a safe word because for me, it&#39;s as simple as you saying </b></i><b><b>no.&quot;</b> <span id=""cke_bm_432S"" style=""display: none;""> </span><span style=""display: none;""> </span></b>Um, okay, two things here. First off, you really should have said that in the contract, idiot! That&#39;s kind of important to no, even if it is &quot;as simple&quot; as that! And secondly... correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but it&#39;s my understanding that a safe word should be something completely unrelated to &quot;no&quot; or &quot;stop&quot; or whatever, because that there may be some &quot;dubious consent games&quot; or rape fantasies or whatever where &quot;no&quot; doesn&#39;t always actually mean &quot;no&quot;. If there&#39;s going to be none of that involved, that&#39;s one thing, although that should be specifically outlined as a hard limit in the contract.

Mia points out that the contract makes it pretty clear that she gives up the rights to refuse. Gabe admits that he doesn&#39;t like the word and that he doesn&#39;t want her using it often (why hello, Christian Grey!), and that she shouldn&#39;t say it before she&#39;s at least tried something (uh... I&#39;m all for trying things too, but I would still draw the line at thing involving fecal matter, for instance, and no, I will NOT try it before saying no), but he does say that he won&#39;t ignore &quot;no&quot; if she says it. This is... very contradictory.

Mia gets back to her reservations, noting that the contract has a clause regarding her fidelity but nothing regarding his. Good catch, lol. When Gabe asks her if that&#39;s important to her, Mia responds, <i><b>&quot;Hell yes. If that contract says I&#39;m yours, then by God it&#39;s going to say you belong to me.&quot;</b></i> Hey, I&#39;ve got no arguments there, seems only fair! And Gabe agrees to that. Mia&#39;s last concern is to make sure that Jace is kept in the dark about it. Okay... I can understand that the average guy would feel uncomfortable with his best friend sleeping with his much younger (though still legal) sister. But the fact that they&#39;re this concerned with Jace&#39;s reaction should he find out is very worrisome. It makes it seem as though Jace thinks he has the final say over everything in Mia&#39;s life. In fact, she tells us this damning line, <i><b>&quot;Hell, he still runs a background check on anyone I date.&quot;</b></i> And Gabe&#39;s response is no better: <i><b>&quot;I would hope so,&quot; Gabe growled.</b></i> HOLY CRAP YOU TWO SHE&#39;S TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OLD! LET HER MAKE HER DATING DECISIONS ON HER OWN! Blargh. Gabe assures her that all Jace will know is that Mia&#39;s working for Gabe and nothing more, and if people speculate, Jace will understand that that goes on in this kind of environment.

Here&#39;s another choice quote:</div><div>
<i><b>&quot;You have a choice to make, Mia,&quot; he said, a harder edge to his voice. &quot;I&#39;m not forcing you to agree to this. But if you do, I expect compliance. We&#39;ll work around the obstacles. I&#39;m not saying you won&#39;t have time for your other interests. Just that my interests will come first.&quot;

His arrogance should so get her back up. It should annoy the hell out of her, but she found it so sexy and so irresistible that it sent butterflies winging through her belly.</b></i></div><div style=""text-align: left;"">
Well, that makes one of us. :/ I know, I know, different strokes for different folks and all that, but why on earth would a guy saying &quot;I&#39;m coming first&quot; (lol, that isn&#39;t usually considered a plus in a sexual relationship if the guy comes first... okay, I&#39;ll shut up now) be attractive to anyone? Whatever happened to &quot;we&#39;re both equals in this relationship&quot;? Am I just too picky or something?

Gabe tells Mia that he doesn&#39;t expect her to live at his place, especially concealing the true nature of their relationship from Jace and all, but he does say they&#39;ll be spending a lot of time together, and suggests that Caroline can cover for her if Jace has any questions. Mia&#39;s surprised that Gabe knows about Caroline, and Gabe responds, with a <i><b>&quot;predatory light&quot;</b></i> in his eyes, <i><b>&quot;There isn&#39;t much I don&#39;t know about you, Mia.&quot;</b></i></div><div>
<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y196/Commander30/library2/627259_original_zps3d082398.gif~original"" title="""" /></div><div style=""text-align: left;"">
RUN AWAY, MIA! RUN FOR THE HILLS! THIS IS CREEPY AS FUCK!

Mia takes this bit of information far too nonchalantly, not knowing <i><b>&quot;whether to be alarmed or triumphant&quot;</b></i> over the fact that Gabe seems to be watching over her every move. I&#39;ll give you a hint, Mia--it&#39;s not the second one.

Gabe demands an answer from her, if all of her fears have been addressed, and Mia admits to herself that he had compromised where she hadn&#39;t believed he would. IF YOU DIDN&#39;T THINK HE WAS GOING TO COMPROMISE, WHY DID YOU SAY FIRST THING THAT YOU ACCEPTED HIS PROPOSAL? WHY DID YOU QUIT YOUR JOB <i>BEFORE</i> YOU LEARNED ALL THIS?! I need a drink. :/ She tells him her answer is yes, and hands him the contract she already signed. ...um. Yeah. She signed it BEFORE they worked out their compromises. You figure out everything that&#39;s wrong with it, I&#39;m too tired right now. :/ Although to be fair, she had already marked up and reworded the clauses she had issues with. Gabe is actually glad she did that too, remaking that it was a very good business practice, and he initials all of the changes before signing it himself. He also says <i><b>&quot;I&#39;ll have my lawyer finalize it and send you a copy.&quot;</b></i> Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but don&#39;t sexual/BDSM contracts usually have no legal standing in court? His lawyer shouldn&#39;t really be involved in this at all.

Mia&#39;s still feeling trepidation, the thought of a lawyer involved in their relationship a bit unsettling, but when Gabe tells her that she can trust him to take care of her, Mia believes she can trust him too. I suppose that&#39;s more than could ever be said for Christian and Ana. Again, at least Mia&#39;s known Gabe for awhile before this. The last line of the chapter is a little chilling, though: <i><b>&quot;She just hoped she didn&#39;t live to regret her decision.&quot;</b></i> What was that about trusting him again, Mia?

That&#39;s it for chapter 6, and this recap. Again, sorry for the wait. Things have been hectic for the past month... and to be honest they&#39;re probably going to be hectic for awhile now, but I still will do my darndest to get the next recaps up in a timely manner. :)</div></center>

<lj-cut text=""Meme""><b>1. What did you do in 2013 that you&#39;d never done before?</b>
Honestly? I can&#39;t think of anything. Like I said, this is going to be a pretty boring meme. I had an average year.

<b>2. Did you keep your new years&#39; resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b>
I didn&#39;t make any, and am not making any for this year.

<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b>
A few old friends, but none of my very close friends/family.

<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b>
Nope. Well, my aunt and uncle&#39;s golden retriever. It had been ten years since I&#39;d seen her, but I&#39;m still going to miss that girl. :(

<b>5. What countries did you visit?</b>
None this year. The states I visited were Nebraska (duh), Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, and Colorado, and with the exception of Colorado those are all going to be pretty much expected for each year given where James&#39;s family lives.

<b>6. What would you like to have in 2014 that you lacked in 2013?</b>
Money. ^^; Well, I didn&#39;t lack money, but... more money.

<b>7. What date from 2013 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b>
Honestly, none, really I had two achievements of this year but even now I can&#39;t remember the dates of them.

<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b>
My two were 1) getting a raise at one of my jobs (my master&#39;s degree FINALLY paid off!) and 2) climbing a 13,000 foot mountain in Colorado.

<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b>
Uh... none, I guess? I guess continuing to not get a full-time job. Still trying.

<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b>
I pretty much never get sick, so my worst illness is actually the one I&#39;m recovering from right now. I caught a cold from my nieces over Christmas. Sore throat, stuffed up head, aching muscles, and a fever. Hooray.

<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b>
phht, I don&#39;t remember/know.

<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b>
I don&#39;t know. Everyone who acted like a decent person, I suppose.

<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b>
James&#39;s ex-wife. The usual (headdesk to infinity)

<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b>
Food, rent, gas... same as last year.

<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b>
Can&#39;t think of anything, honestly. ^^; (Told you this would be boring.)

<b>16. What song will always remind you of 2013?</b>
Only the last month of 2013, but I&#39;ve listened to it so much that there can be no other answer...
<lj-embed id=""165""/>

<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you:

i. happier or sadder?</b> A hell of a lot happier. This meme from last year referenced all the mental breakdowns I&#39;d had, but my mental stability has been very steady this year, for which I&#39;m quite grateful. (knock on wood)

<b>ii. thinner or fatter?</b> Fatter. Blarg.

<b>iii. richer or poorer?</b> Money-wise, I think I have about the same right now as I did last year. But I&#39;m a lot more in debt, unfortunately. :/ I can say pretty firmly that James is richer than he was last year, though!

<b>18. What do you wish you&#39;d done more of?</b>
Cleaning. The apartment is a constant mess.

<b>19. What do you wish you&#39;d done less of?</b>
Nagging James.

<b>20. How will you be spending Christmas?</b>
We had lunch with my dad&#39;s side of the family in Lincoln (35 people from the count I heard!), then my parents, husband, stepson, brothers, sister-in-law, nieces, and I all opened presents at my praents&#39; house.

<b>21. At any point in the past year did you do something that you consider completely out of your usual character?</b>
Not really.

<b>22. Did you fall in love in 2013?</b>
Nah.

<b>23. How many one-night stands?</b>
None.

<b>24. What was your favorite TV program?</b>
uh... Yamada&#39;s First Time? lol. James got me hooked on Doctor Who, too. :)

<b>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn&#39;t hate this time last year?</b>
No.

<b>26. What was the best book you read this year?</b>
Again, I&#39;ll just list the last book I read, which was &quot;Mister B. Gone&quot; by Clive Barker. Very interesting book. A little gory, but I still enjoyed it. Unique as hell. :)

<b>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b>
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/ThePianoGuys"">The Piano Guys</a>

<b>28. What did you want and get?</b>
Mental stability! Hooray!

<b>29. What did you want and not get?</b>
A full-time job.

<b>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b>
Frozen

<b>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b>
I worked, then James and I went to see a local production of Les Miserables, then we had a very late supper with a friend of mine who was in the production. I turned 27... noooo! Officially in my late twenties! ^^;

<b>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b>
A better job.

<b>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2012?</b>
Since the dress code changed at OPL and I&#39;m not allowed to wear T-shirts or clothing with words on it anymore (unless it&#39;s library related), a lot less T-shirts than I&#39;d normally wear.

<b>34. What kept you sane?</b>
Myself, I think. Like I said, I&#39;m in mentally a much better place than I was a year ago. I think I&#39;ve finally learned how to mentally take care of myself.

<b>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b>
None

<b>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</b>
Ugh. Anything involving our lying sack of shit president. Sorry... I don&#39;t care for him. And I especially don&#39;t care for the fact that the media continues to fall over itself proclaiming that he&#39;s the greatest thing since sliced bread, when he&#39;s shown that he&#39;s nothing but a self-serving jackass. :/

<b>37. Who did you miss?</b>
I don&#39;t know. I guess my nieces and my stepson when they&#39;re not around. (Not that I want them around all the time, mind you. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m just the aunt/stepmother and not the mother.)

<b>38. Who was the best new person you met?</b>
I don&#39;t think I really met anyone new this year.

<b>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2013.</b>
Again... I honestly can&#39;t think of anything. ^^; I had a pretty uneventful year.

<b>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:</b>
lol</lj-cut>"

<a href=""https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9929508/1/"">O Little Scheme of Bethlehem</a>

It's a Pinky and the Brain fanfic, with special guest star Jesus Christ. No, really. Blame the Christmas special where Pinky offhandedly mentions them traveling back to Bethlehem as part of a world domination scheme. I've been pondering (heh) this fic for probably a good decade now, and finally I've gotten it out... just in time for Christmas, too!

Also, I am working on the next Rush recap. It's coming kind of slowly, and I apologize for that. ^^; This whole sporking business is more time-intensive than I thought. (Of course, I also just write really slowly anyway. That >5000 word fanfic took me a good few weeks from start to finish. Urp.)"

<center>
<img src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y196/Commander30/library2/YDNpJ2r_zpsaf743c52.gif"" /></center>

<lj-cut text=""Chapters 2-3"">Chapter 2 of rush starts off with Caroline, Mia&#39;s friend and roommate, getting the story from her about how Gabe <i><b>&quot;dragged [her] onto the terrace&quot;</b></i> (again, NOT ROMANTIC AT ALL) the morning after. Mia confirms the story, and then...

<div style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Caroline made an exaggerated face and then fanned herself with one hand. &quot;And here I thought you couldn&#39;t possibly have as good a time as we did. But I sure as hell wasn&#39;t kissed by a gorgeous billionaire.&quot;</b></i></div><div>
PRIORITIES, WHAT ARE THEY?!

(sigh) Whatever. Fine. The only thing on Mia&#39;s groggy, confused mind is <i><b>&quot;But why?&quot;</b></i> GEE I DON&#39;T KNOW. IT COULDN&#39;T POSSIBLY MEAN HE HAS THE HOTS FOR YOU OR ANYTHING. And here&#39;s a telling line: <i><b>&quot;It hadn&#39;t been a request, but then Gabe Hamilton never </b></i><b>asked</b><i><b> for anything. He gave orders and he expected results. And she didn&#39;t know what it said about her that she found that particular trait delicious.&quot;</b></i> Well, I don&#39;t either. Personally, I like being politely asked to do things rather than feeling like I&#39;m in boot camp all the time, but hey, what do I know?

Sorry I keep quoting so much, but Caroline states the obvious:</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>&quot;He wants you, chica. And why wouldn&#39;t he? You&#39;re young and hot, and I bet you&#39;ve starred in his fantasies a time or two over the years.&quot;

Mia wrinkled her nose. &quot;You make it sound so icky.&quot;</b></i></div><div>
Hey, I agree with Mia there at the end! :P

Mia states again that she isn&#39;t sure of what he wants, and Caroline basically says she&#39;s beyond hope if she can&#39;t figure it out, but still decides to get her ready to DAZZLE!!!!!! Are we turning her into a Meyerpire now?.

We switch to Gabe, sitting in his office and going over the contract and pondering his method of approach. This is said to usually be a straight business transaction for him, as <i><b>&quot;he&#39;d been caught with his pants down once&quot;</b></i>. Isn&#39;t the pants coming off the whole point? ;P

But, of course, Mia&#39;s diiiiiiiiiifferent! He already knows he can&#39;t keep his emotional distance! He&#39;d intimidated her high school dates, for crying out loud! And yeah... that whole &quot;you lay a hand on my daughter/sister/younger female in my care, I KILL YOU&quot; trope is so old, and stupid, and offensive. :/ Moving on. Ahem. As stated in the video of chapter one, Gabe has watched Mia grow up, and even if he hadn&#39;t been lusting after her the entire time, he was still creepily possessive regarding her. With an added bonus of being way too concerned with her sex life! Regarding her college days, <i><b>&quot;He didn&#39;t even want to think of how many lovers she&#39;d had. It would just piss him off.&quot;</b></i>

Yeah, because her sex life is TOTALLY your business.</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y196/Commander30/library2/fuckyou_zps4a3d0ff7.gif"" title="""" /></div><div>
And then, as if that weren&#39;t enough &quot;fuck you&quot;s to be had from me...</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Mia didn&#39;t&nbsp; know it yet, but she was going to be his.</b></i>

<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y196/Commander30/library2/fuckyou_zps4a3d0ff7.gif"" title="""" /></div><div>
YOU HORRIBLE PIECE OF SHIT.

Okay, I get that you need to develop how much your couple wants each other. I understand that. But WHY is it always laid out in such a rape-tastic way for the guy? Hey, Gabe? <i>What if Mia doesn&#39;t want you? </i>Is she still going to be yours? Does she have ANY say in this whatsoever?!

Gah. Moving on.

Gabe starts to reflect that, hey, Jace will be an issue if he wants to pursue a very controlling relationship with his younger sister, and decides that he&#39;ll just deal with that later. Yeah, I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t come back to bite him in the ass. But speaking of Jace, he and Ash decide to show up! This of course irritates Gabe to no end. Best friends and all, right?

We then get our our info dump on the three best friends/business partners. Gabe tends to handle the details in their hotel business, while the other two travel and oversee projects. They all met in college, apparently bonding over <i><b>&quot;alcohol and frat parties and plenty of girl chasing&quot;</b></i>. Gabe and Ash supported Jace when his parents died and he gained guardianship of Mia, and Jace and Ash supported Gabe through <i><b>&quot;very messy and public divorce&quot;</b></i>. GEE, I WONDER WHY SUCH A FLEXIBLE AND RESPECTFUL GUY GOT DIVORCED. :/</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y196/Commander30/library2/YAyley5_zps8a7f3ba7.gif"" title="""" /></div><div>
For the record, I&#39;m certainly not saying that everyone who gets divorced is an asshole. Being both in someone&#39;s second marriage and also the product of someone&#39;s second marriage, if it weren&#39;t for divorce I wouldn&#39;t be here. ;) And while my mother and my husband both drive me crazy sometimes, they&#39;re also some of the best people I know. However, going off everything we already know about this guy, just two chapters in? Yeah, I would have divorced him, too.

Ash is the charming one of the duo, while Jace is more quiet and thoughtful, and Gabe reflects this must be why women are so crazy over both of them and readily agree to threesomes. Uh... okay? I&#39;m not sure why that would make a difference, but whatever.

Our topic then meanders back to Gabe&#39;s divorce (yes, the subjects bounce this badly). Because Gabe just has to be martyred here, I guess. His ex-wife, Lisa, is completely vilified for daring to divorce him and making <i><b>&quot;baseless accusations that forever tarnished Gabe&#39;s reputation both personally and professionally. To this day, Gabe still didn&#39;t understand what had made Lisa snap.&quot; </b></i>Maybe the fact that you&#39;re a controlling douchebag? He claims everything they did was consensual, but I&#39;m not buying it. Especially with the concluding line that that Lisa had come out on top through the divorce, <i><b>&quot;the seeming victim of a manipulative, abusive bastard.&quot; </b></i>Now again, being married to a divorced man, I know that the man is always automatically the villain and men more often than not get a raw deal and are blamed as the fault of anything wrong in the relationship simply because he has a penis, and I agree that that is grossly wrong and unfair. But? Given everything I know about Gabe? I believe his ex-wife! If she said he was manipulative and abusive, and Gabe can&#39;t figure out why she&#39;d say that, the only possible reason I can come up with is because <i>it was the truth!</i>

Anyway, back to the plot. Gabe asks why Jace and Ash are still there as he thought they had to be in California, and Jace says that there was a mechanical issue with the plane they were supposed to take, and that their replacement will leave in half an hour. Gabe relaxes a tiny bit, since that means that they&#39;ll be gone before Mia arrives, and then gets a hard-on thinking about her. I&#39;m not even kidding. This goddamn book. Thank God Gabe&#39;s sitting behind his desk. He mentions to Jace that they missed Mia at the opening last night, thankfully leaving out the sordid details, but they are interrupted when Jace and Ash&#39;s lady friend from last night comes in, ready to accompany them to California. She sits on Ash&#39;s lap and Jace slides his hand <i><b>&quot;possessively&quot;</b></i> up her knees, <i><b>&quot;reminding her that at least for the present, she was his.&quot;</b></i> Ah, Jace, I see you suffer from &quot;asshole male romantic lead&quot; syndrome as well, huh? Argh. Gabe brushes them out of his office, but before leaving, Jace asks Gabe to check up with Mia while they&#39;re gone. Oh, the irony. :/

Chapter three begins with Mia making her way into the offices, conveniently enough having a security card that lets her in. (Okay, her brother does work there, so that&#39;s fair enough, I suppose.) Caroline of course made Mia look as sexy as possible. Gotta please the man who already has made it known in no uncertain terms that he wants you, I suppose. Caroline&#39;s intention was to give her a look that drives men wild, but Mia <i><b>&quot;wasn&#39;t sure she wanted to drive Gabe to anything. Sure, he&#39;d starred in more than one of her teenage--and adult--fantasies, but now that he&#39;d gotten up close and personal, she sensed an immense power that radiated from him. It had intimidated her and made her think twice about whether she&#39;d ever be able to handle a man like him.&quot;</b></i>

Not too late to just walk away, Mia.

Of course she doesn&#39;t, though. She makes her way to the receptionist just a minute before ten and after given the go-ahead Eleanor, the receptionist, heads down the hallway to Gabe&#39;s office, and... stops at the door.</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i><b>She suddenly felt like the world&#39;s biggest idiot. Whatever had come over Gabe at last night&#39;s party was probably hugely misinterpreted by her. And she&#39;d come dressed to kill.</b></i></div><div>
ARE YOU SERIOUS?! HOW IN THE HELL COULD YOU MISINTERPRET THAT?! YES, YOU ARE AN IDIOT!

Just as she&#39;s about to run away and end this book right then and there, Gabe opens the door and says he didn&#39;t think she&#39;d come. After the &quot; you&#39;d better damn well be there&quot; threat from last chapter. Just... ugh. They&#39;re stupid. Both of them.

Gabe leads her in his office and shows her a seat, sexual tension ahoy, blah blah blah, they awkwardly stare at each other for awhile, and after a bit of dicking around, Gabe finally gets to the point: <i><b>&quot;I want you to come to work for me.&quot;</b></i> lol, okay, that makes it sound more like &quot;I&#39;m sick today, could you go into work for me and cover my shift?&quot; Mia&#39;s confused, thinking that he&#39;d wanted to work it in some other way, obviously, and tells him that she already has a job. Gabe tells her it&#39;s a job far beneath her, and at this point, speaking as someone who worked as cashier after getting her bachelor&#39;s degree, I just want to stuff a cactus up his ass. Jobs are stupidly hard to come by nowadays, and Mia&#39;s lucky to even have one at all, even if it is, surprise surprise, a cashier! Mia, to give her credit, is also offended and points out that she never intended for her job to be long-term, causing Gabe to tell her basically, &quot;Good, so quit it and come work for me instead!&quot; He wants her to be his personal assistant. Mia, knowing that he doesn&#39;t have personal assistants because he doesn&#39;t like them, cuts to the chase:</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i><b>&quot;Why?&quot; she asked bluntly. &quot;What is it you want, Gabe? And while you&#39;re at it, explain last night. Because I&#39;m at a complete loss.&quot;

His smile was slow and deliciously arrogant. &quot;So my kitten has claws.&quot;</b></i></div><div>
GO DIE IN A FIRE, YOU ARROGANT, CONDESCENDING BAG OF DICKS.

Bag of Dicks finally stops dicking around and tells her that he wants her. Mia gets flustered and is at a loss for words, obviously incredibly shocked that her long-time crush reciprocates. Wasn&#39;t... that obvious from last night? Ugh. I don&#39;t even know even more. Anyway, she haltingly suggests that her working for him wouldn&#39;t quite be appropriate if that&#39;s what he actually wants from her, and Grand Master Douchebag insists that&#39;s why she&#39;d be &quot;working&quot; for him in the first place. No, it&#39;s not because he wanted to give her a better job or thinks that she&#39;d be an asset to his company or anything asinine like that, are you crazy? It&#39;s because <i><b>&quot;The purpose of your working for me is so you&#39;d be at my side at all times. And I&#39;d have you when I want and how I want.&quot; </b></i>I predict a lot of &quot;no clothes allowed&quot; days.

Mia admits that <i><b>&quot;This is overwhelming&quot; </b></i>(understatement of the century there), and that Gabe&#39;s voice and manners make her feel <b><i>&quot;hunted.</i> Stalked.&quot;</b> HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THAT THAT&#39;S NOT A GOOD THING?! Gabe calls her over to his chair and pulls her into his lap, caressing her and playing with her hair and generally being manipulative with her. He tells her that their professional and personal relationship <i><b>&quot;is not a traditional one&quot;</b></i>, and after more banal flirting, he finally clarifies:</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>&quot;I&#39;ll own you,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;Body, soul. You&#39;ll belong to me.&quot;</b></i>

<img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y196/Commander30/library2/465590_400523343306161_2106066718_o_zpsf2fa3d3f.jpg"" title="""" /></div><div>
OH, IS THAT ALL.

(apologies for the picture... blame Gix... he&#39;s playing Skylanders... Kaos is friggin&#39; awesome.... me and my villain love... ahem. Moving on.)

Mia&#39;s reaction to this bombshell makes me LOL: <i><b>&quot;Whoa. That sounded so... heavy.&quot;</b></i>

<center>
<lj-embed id=""163"" />
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
Gabe tells her that he&#39;ll be patient and guide her through it, and then asks if she wants him, too. Of course, he has to do this by brushing his lips against her skin, nibbling her earlobe,and whispering in her ear, so you know, he&#39;s making sure she can think straight. Big surprise--she tells him yes. Or rather, croaks it. Gabe then informs her of the contract, asking her to read it over the weekend and give him her decision by Monday. To his credit, he doesn&#39;t say SIGN THIS OR ELSE. After asserting his dominance and control-freakish-ness once more by calling for his driver to take her home and saying he&#39;ll arrange for her ride back to the office on Monday, we end yet another chapter with Gabe cursing! JUST WHAT I WANTED!</div><div>
<i><b>&quot;You&#39;re so sure of yourself,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Of me.&quot;

He slid the receiver away from his mouth as he fixed his gaze on her. &quot;The only thing I&#39;m sure of is that I&#39;ve waited entirely too damn long to have you.&quot;</b></i></div><div style=""text-align: left;"">
WHAT A KIND, PATIENT, UNDERSTANDING SOUL!</div></center>

"event","Hey guys!

Just wanted to pop in really quick for those of you wondering when the next Rush review will be coming. I hope to get it up soon, but I have something slightly different planned for the next one and it's a matter of scheduling it and getting it put together. But don't worry, it's coming!

To give this entry a little more meat besides that, Gix and I are going to a local production of Les Miserables tomorrow night. It's supposedly my birthday present, but Gix is more excited about it than I am. ;) (Not to imply that I'm not looking forward to it, because I definitely am!) A college friend of mine is in it, and the three of us are going to hang out after the production, so that'll be great to catch up with her too. :)

Hope everything's going well with all of you! :D"

"event","Meme from <lj user=""girltype"" />, I&#39;m bored at work lawl.(sorry for so many posts today)

<lj-cut text=""Meme""><b>1. If you&rsquo;ve ever tried drugs or alcohol, what was your reason for first trying it?</b>
Because... I wanted to, I guess? Alcohol&#39;s the only drug I&#39;ve ever tried, and I&#39;ve always been legal in the current country I was in when I&#39;ve had it. (I drank in England when I was eighteen and Jamaica when I was nineteen, but those were both legal there. I didn&#39;t start drinking in the USA until my twenty-first birthday.) So in other words, I didn&#39;t need a reason other than I just wanted to. :)

<b>2. Do you think you could ever have an abortion if you unexpectedly turned up pregnant right this second?</b>
It wouldn&#39;t really be unexpected... ;P But seriously, though (and not to get into a big abortion debate), the only reason I, personally, could ever justify getting an abortion would be if the pregnancy was life-threatening.

<b>3. If you were far from home and needed to sleep for the night, would you choose to rent a crappy motel room for $60 or sleep in your car for free?</b>
Hotel room for sure. I&#39;d need a toilet.

<b>4. Is there a color shirt you&rsquo;d NEVER wear?</b>
Hmm... no, I don&#39;t think so. There&#39;s some colors I don&#39;t wear as often, but I&#39;m not opposed to any colors or anything.

<b>5. Is there a situation where you caved into peer pressure and regretted it?</b>
Yes.

<b>6. What is your favorite video game console? Why?</b>
lol, I&#39;m not much of a gamer. I use the Wii the most, but that&#39;s really James&#39;s console, not mine.

<b>7. Do you like vanilla candles?</b>
Yeah, they&#39;re nice for special occasions.

<b>8. Have you ever been in a relationship that was going great, and then suddenly something weird happened and you just KNEW it was going to be over soon?</b>
Yes.

<b>9. Would you ever bleach your hair platinum blonde?</b>
(shrug) I don&#39;t really have a reason to, nor would I have a reason not to. So... maybe? I don&#39;t really care either way.

<b>10. What are your plans for tomorrow?</b>
Go to work. After that, I don&#39;t know. Wheee.

<b>11. What did you have for breakfast?</b>
I don&#39;t eat breakfast.

<b>12. Have you had a haircut in 2013 yet?</b>
I&#39;ve had two. The second one was just a few weeks ago and I got my hair cut really short--it&#39;s not even chin length. I love it. :D (I really hate having long hair.)

<b>13. Who last slept in your bed besides you?</b>
James, durrrr

<b>14. What time did you wake up today?</b>
6:30 at first when the alarm went off for James, and 9:15 for real. Yeah, I sleep in like crazy on my mornings off. But I won&#39;t be getting home until 11:00 tonight, so it all evens out, I guess.

<b>15. How long until your next birthday?</b>
Two weeks from tomorrow. yaaaaaay (I really don&#39;t care)

<b>16. What was the last movie you watched?</b>
Beethoven. Yeah, I like reliving my childhood. HATERS GONNA HATE

<b>17. If you could see any musician live, front row, who would you choose?</b>
Heart. Ann and Nancy Wilson. They are teh awesome. :)

<b>18. When did you last consume something that had peanut butter?</b>
...wow, I honestly don&#39;t remember. ^^;

<b>19. What&rsquo;s the last song you heard?</b>
&quot;Africa&quot; by Toto. I was shelf reading and listening to my iPod.

<b>20. When you say you love someone, do you mean it?</b>
Yes. I don&#39;t say it very often, though (although just because I don&#39;t say it doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t love that person, for the record).

<b>21. Do you plan on sleeping in tomorrow?</b>
Can&#39;t, have to work. :(

<b>22. Do you still talk to any of your ex&rsquo;s?</b>
Don&#39;t have any.

<b>23. As of this minute, what is going through your mind?</b>
&quot;Just an hour and a half left before I can go home.&quot;

<b>24. Where&rsquo;s the last place you went?</b>
Eh, work? Where I am right now? ;) I went to Target earlier today to get new batteries for my garage door opener. I live such an exciting life, I know. (If we&#39;re talking out of town, James and I went to Columbus (my hometown) last Saturday.)

<b>25. Have you held hands with anyone lately?</b>
James.

<b>26. Has anyone let you down recently?</b>
Just myself.

<b>27. Does it bother you when people try to make you jealous?</b>
Not... really? I don&#39;t think anyone really tries to do that, honestly.

<b>28. Whats the next movie you want to see in theaters?</b>
SAVING MR. BANKS. I can&#39;t WAIT to see that one. :D

<b>29. Do you have more than $50 in your room?</b>
lol, no. I rarely carry cash anymore.

<b>30. Are both of your blood parents still in your life?</b>
Yep. They&#39;ll be in my life on Saturday, in fact, helping us move James&#39;s stuff from his storage locker to the aforementioned garage we now have at our apartment. :)

<b>31. Were you tired when you woke up this morning?</b>
At 6:30? Yes, hence why I fell back asleep. At 9:15? Not as much, but I was still groggy.

<b>32. Who is probably talking a load of crap about you right now?</b>
James&#39;s ex-wife. I kind of told her off on the phone the other night. I was kind of fed up with both of them for not knowing was was in their own divorce decree, tbh. :/

<b>33. When was the last time you went and bought a cd?</b>
Heh, I think it was a few years ago.

<b>34. Do you sometimes wake up in the morning, lay in bed and think about life?</b>
More like go to bed at night, lie in bed and think about life, and thus stay up way too late because I couldn&#39;t go to sleep. MY LIFE

<b>35. Are you happy winter is coming soon?</b>
Winter&#39;s my least favorite season... so hell no. I&#39;m enjoying autumn while I can.

<b>36. Do you have drama in your life?</b>
Unfortunately (although not as much as I had before getting rid of my Facebook, OOHHHHHHH)</lj-cut>"

I recently bought a book and just now finished it. It's... well, let's just say I spent a lot of time inwardly screaming at the book. And a few times no-so-inwardly. (Just ask the hubby. ;)) I'd like to do a review/sporking of it here. Would anyone be interested? I'd go chapter by chapter (the chapters are fairly short so I may do multiple chapters in a single entry), although I can say now I probably won't go as in-depth as the sporkers at <lj user=""das_sporking""> do. I can't promise to be as entertaining as they are, either... but if you've ever wanted to see me rant and rave at asshole characters, now's your chance to speak up! :P"

"event","Well, may as well post an update post. Sooooo...

-James and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary last month, woo. Hard to believe it's been that long already (but on the same token, it's hard to believe we've only been together for two years, it seems like a lot longer). :)

-I got a very nice raise at one of my jobs (as in, it's about 50% more than what I had been making). The university I work at had a year-long process to evaluate their workers' salaries and make them more competitive, and basically, since I have a master's degree they changed my pay rate to reflect that. YAY!

-James (who works at the same university) ended up getting screwed out of his raise for a bullshit reason, but that's okay because shortly after that, he got promoted to a job that pays over twice as much as what he had been making before and is making more than he would have with the supposed pay increase he was getting anyway. XD

-I haven't really been into fandom at all (big surprise there, I know), but I am planning on writing an entry for <lj user=""anti_bella"">'s newest theme. Other than that, I've been watching a lot of Price is Right on YouTube, mostly for nostalgia (while I am branching out a bit, I'm mostly sticking to the Bob Barker/Rod Roddy episodes because those are the ones I grew up with) but also because the reactions the contestants have when they win just can't be beat. XD

-I'm also playing Sims 3 again... with Sims 4 announced for launch next year, I figured I should get my money's worth out of all the money I've dropped on expansion packs for 3. ^^; The Sexsmith legacy is pretty much toast, unfortunately, and I don't know if I'm going to start another legacy or not, but it feels good to be playing again--AND playing on a computer that doesn't make it buggy and/or constantly crash. :)

-Still playing Petz, and almost have every purebred breed in all ten colors.

-I'm at the heaviest weight I've ever been, so I'm working out six days a week with the My Fitness Coach for the Wii. Even if I don't lose any weight, I'm still sticking with it, because a week from today I'm heading out to Colorado with my parents and older brother to climb hopefully two mountains, but if not two then at least one. :) I'm looking forward to it; I' haven't gone mountain climbing in over two years now and I'm looking forward to getting away for even just a few days.

-<lj-embed id=""159""/>
Just gonna leave this here. :)

That's what's new with me, I guess. Hope everything is going well with all of you. :)"

"event","So I have no clue what's been going on with me lately.

I'm pretty much one of the most non-confrontational, agreeable people out there. I've made it a point, especially in recent years, to keep what few well-defined opinions I have to myself.

Most of the online population, however, is the exact opposite of me, and uses the internet to blast their political opinions for all to hear. Facebook is where I see most of this. While it annoys me, I respect the fact that they have every right to use their Facebook pages however they choose, so I usually keep my opinions (either for or against) out of it.

So I don't know what's gotten into me the past week or so. Perhaps my bullshit and hypocrisy tolerance has finally run dry. But I've been commenting on a lot of political posts on Facebook. I actually made an account on a blog I (used to) frequent today, just so I could comment on how off-topic and offensive I found their latest, 100% political and accusatory post on their supposedly non-political blog... and of course I got attacked for disagreeing with them. But even before I did, even having these political discussions on Facebook that are more-or-less civil in comparison...

I still hate it. I feel drained. Letting out long bottled-up opinions is supposed to feel therapeutic, right? I just feel worse now. I feel like shit. I feel like just going home and crawling under the covers.

I don't know. Maybe the internet isn't for me. Maybe I should just chop off my hands so that I'm not tempted to comment on anything anymore. :/

<b>edit</b> and I got a review for fanfic today, too...

<i>:omg -.- OH SO UR SAYING WANDA AND BLONDA SHOULD OF DIED?! -.- they were
twins! GAWD! how unrealistic to the show... :l</i>

I don't remember saying that. :/ But yeah, thanks for that."

"event","Okay, so why is LJ saying that I updated an hour ago? And yesterday it was saying I last updated on Wednesday. What the hell?

I figured I might as well update for real and see if that fixes it. :/

So, um...

-James got me hooked on Doctor Who. For a few months now, in fact, but I haven't made it official here yet, so... I'm making it official. :) I wouldn't at all call myself a ""Whovian"", though, at least not to the extent James and his dad are. I've only seen some of the very very first episodes with the First Doctor, and the current series starting with when Clara joined. So the only Doctors I'm at all familiar with are One and Eleven, natch. :P And I still don't understand the show that much, but I'm definitely enjoying the ride. Also: OMG WRITERS STOP SHIP-TEASING ME WITH ALL THAT DOCTOR/CLARA I KNOW YOU'RE JUST FAKING ME OUT AND YOU'RE DOING A DAMN GOOD JOB OF IT TOO DAMN YOOOOOOOOOU (shipper on deck) ^^;

-I'm somewhat embarrassed about the next show I've gotten hooked on, but it's still so damn hilarious I just have to recommend it. ""Hmm, really, Commander's actually somewhat embarrassed to like this? Well, what's the genre she always says she doesn't care for--anime, she can't stand most anime. But if she were to like anime, it would be some big sweeping epic and not some perverted show about a high-school girl just trying to get laid..."" <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8aHESNyckw"">OKAY FOR SERIOUS I HAVE NO SHAME</a>

(And it's not just me. When I grabbed the video to link to it and the song started playing (and it IS an awesome song, you've gotta admit), James started singing along.) ;)

Okay, so explanation for THAT one. James got Hulu Plus, which we can actually watch using our Wii, so... we sort of kind of have TV again, wut. So we were going through all the shows and deciding if we should try one out, and one of us (I don't remember who) jokingly suggested to find the most ridiculous-sounding anime title we could find. We come across ""B Gata H Kei: Yamada's First Time"" and we both say ""oh God, this sounds perfect"", we start it up, get a ""the following program is intended only for mature audiences"" warning, and then in the show some of the first words out of our heroine's mouth are ""I want to have one hundred sex friends!"" and yeah. We're dead. My God. XDDDDD

Seriously though, this show is freaking hilarious. James and I were dying of laughter (intended, of course) the entire show. And you actually get to care for the characters throughout the run, too, so much that I found the manga online because I had to know if Yamada and Kosuda finally, FINALLy do it. (They don't in the anime, not for lacking of trying, mainly because they're both awkward virgins and Yamada's also a PSYCHOPATH, although they get really damn close.) They do, and I was happy, so I think I ship them, too. XD <a href=""http://mangable.com/b_gata_h_kei/chapter-1/1/"">Here's</a> the manga--and it should go without saying that both it and the anime are not safe for work (they're not hentai, though). Or kids. But if you're an adult at home who wants to laugh your ass off, I can't think of a better suggestion. XD

-We also got all three Guitar Heroes for James's PS2. I played the games a few times back when they were super-popular and my younger brother's friends brought their PS2 over to our house (so this was obviously back when I was in high school) and was absolutely HORRIBLE at it, even on easy. But James discovered that you can play the game with just a regular PS2 controller rather than the guitar, and THANK GOD. I'm not horrible at getting the fret buttons hit, but it's remembering to strum at the same time that always kills me, but with the controller, all you have to do is press the buttons! Mind you, I'm still not great by any means (and I'm still on easy, and only playing bass), but I'm a lot better than I was. James and I started a co-op career on 3 (I think) and we're not doing too shabby. Again, though, I'm making him play the guitar on the guitar controller, since he's a lot better than me.

-We leave to get Asher one week from today! And editing the previous comment--his mother did change her phone number, and did get a hold of us. So we're all good to go!

So, in short--still alive, still existing online. In fact, I'm on LJ a lot, although most of my activity is reading and commenting on the das-sporking community nowadays. :)"

you're watching your tv show or movie or whatever it is, and that couple that you wanted to see together but knew they never would (because all the couples you ship are ultimately doomed from the start like that and you know it) actually get together! and are happy! and you're like ""omg i have to post this to livejournal because my ship finally happened and that never happens to me omg i'm so damn excited over this!""...

and then you wake up.

at 1:00 pm.

this was on the heel of a weird dream about being in a hotel or convention center or something and a bomb going off and a train careering right towards your mom and the little old lady who was taking care of you at the hotel for some reason and you see the horse that the little old lady is so attached to so you run off and pick up the horse (?) and carry it to safety while your mother shields the old lady from the train and yadda yadda yadda i should have realized it was a dream before then, especially because i always have strange dreams when i'm sick.

i had already called in sick to work from my first job today (before falling back asleep until 1:00, of course)... and i'm probably going to end up calling in sick to my second job, too. i'm exhausted. in fact, i probably would still be asleep right now if i didn't force myself to get up then because i don't want to be awake all night. james is home sick too, so at least i'm not lonely. not that either one of us is being very conversational right now. i mean, i'm so tired i can barely talk. i'm too tired to even use the shift key, as you can see. i forced myself to make lunch even though i wasn't hungry and i ended up spilling it all over myself and the floor... fail katie, fail.

sorry. am bored and trying to keep myself occupied on until 4:00, which is when i'm going to email my boss and tell her i'm sick. i hate calling in (or emailing in) sick, even when i actually am sick... and i'm really just more tired than sick.

wheeeeeee. i need to cut back my hours."

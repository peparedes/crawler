"event","What a day... :o|<br /><br />I spent last night in the company of lovely Loobeh, which was so much fun (being with her is great), an absolute privilege and quite incredible really. I bought her some more flowers which she seemed to like, however I think that maybe she is becoming a little bit fed up of having flowers all the time (I need to think of some other things... I'm thick!)<br />She is <b>such</b> a sweety, as she made me lunch again (mmm! It was so yummy!) and also made me a mug of tea to take with me on my train journey, which I am so glad that I had (read on for more details).<br /><br />Her mum was really nice and gave me a lift to Southampton Airport station ready to catch the 8.08 train to London. However, it was not to be since I got there and discovered that this particular train had broken down the other side of Southampton and was blocking the line - damn those people on the train must've been pissed.<br /><br />So... I had to catch a local train up to Eastleigh of all places (after waiting around for thirty minutes) and then change again - I've never seen such a packed train, it reminded me of the Tokyo underground (okay so I've never been there, just seen the pictures). To cut a long story short, I crawled into work at 10.30 am.<br /><br />On the upside, I managed to snag myself a load of free ""stuff"" from work today due to an ""environmental awareness"" day - in other words a few trade stands and lots of freebies. I was rather impressed with my haul: a holdall, a mug, some headphones, a t-shirt, <b>chocolate</b>, a new notebook, numerous pens... and some other things (including a wheelie-bin pen pot FTW!! Picture tomorrow...)<br /><br />I then spent most of my afternoon in online ""meetings"" about reports (I felt so bad because I couldn't text Lou back) which I am in charge of creating for infrastructure heads in Europe to improve supply chain operations, finally rounding off my day with yet another report on some inventory. Finally my week is empty of reports, however, as fun as they are they don't compare to the sheer horror of having to conduct a training session tomorrow from 10 am until 3 pm for some new users of the systems (here's me thinking that I would have a quiet day!) At least I get to wear casual clothes tomorrow so I can at least relax while I'm teaching.<span class=""bodytext""></span><br /><br />Due to coming in late to work, I had to work a bit later tonight and left at 6.15 pm because I felt absolutely dreadful. In fact my eyes hurt so much I couldn't keep them open - thank goodness that I bought some new headphones (the over-ear type), as they drown out the humdrum office noise so well, plus they look lush (well to me anyway haha).<br /><br />Loobeh's coming over tomorrow evening after work for the weekend... YAY!!! I can't wait to see her. As I am quite an emotional person I think that it will be so heart-warming to see her standing there waiting for me... sorry I'll stop now before I get too soppy. Apparently we're going to see some people called David Mitchell and Robert Webb at the local theatre.... ;oD"

I am terrible with all these updates)<br /><br />From the time he was born, I&#39;d always talked about how&nbsp;life would&nbsp;when I am thirty. I would be the mother of a son who is&nbsp;at the brink of going to primary school.<br /><br />It&#39;s incredible to see it all happening now.<br /><br />Six.<br /><br />It&#39;s a brilliant age.<br /><br />The boy is independent and a very sociable fella. He has a group of friends in school that he hangs out with and has an incredible way of making friends whereever he goes.<br /><br />He is curious and asks a million questions a day about how things work or why certain situations happen. It does take a patient mind to listen and answer his questions accordingly.<br /><br />And as far as music lessons are going, it looks like he&#39;s taking to the violin really well. So here&#39;s hoping that he will be able to have a good journey with his strings.<br /><br />He&#39;s&nbsp; also the stubborn-est (is there such a word?) person I&#39;ve ever known. You should see the verbal exchanges&nbsp;we have. Seriously, the boy cannot be broken when he sets his mind to do something. It&#39;s like watching an engineer concentrating on his mechanics. Drives me nuts sometimes.<br /><br />He&#39;s still very much Daddy&#39;s boy. Loves to ask the husband to do everything with him but when it comes to reading, it&#39;s still very much Mummy&#39;s job. He&#39;s picked up so many words this year and is able to complete most books these days. =)<br /><br />So what did we do on his birthday?<br /><div class=""separator"" style=""text-align: center; clear: both""><br /><a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C6WWm9AVgKE/TpOnQqZsNRI/AAAAAAAACrM/W_N63f-sfpM/s1600/181.JPG"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em""><img border=""0"" height=""640"" kca=""true"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C6WWm9AVgKE/TpOnQqZsNRI/AAAAAAAACrM/W_N63f-sfpM/s640/181.JPG"" width=""478"" /></a></div><br />Well... he got to play soccer! And had such a blast with the sport. =) I have a feeling he would be a boy who likes his sports. Best thing about soccer? He got to run and run and run for an entire hour. And, still, it was barely a tinge of sweat for this boy.<br /><div class=""separator"" style=""text-align: center; clear: both""><br /><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WGfn7s6fLVc/TpOni8u0kRI/AAAAAAAACrU/2-9fwRkJEis/s1600/hk2.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em""><img border=""0"" height=""640"" kca=""true"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WGfn7s6fLVc/TpOni8u0kRI/AAAAAAAACrU/2-9fwRkJEis/s640/hk2.jpg"" width=""426"" /></a></div><br />And when the night came, we brought out some cupcakes for a lil birthday celebration.<br /><br />Which was followed by a trip to Hong Kong&#39;s Disneyland.<br /><br />More on that soon!<br />"

You will wander in and out of the bedrooms lugging your chosen toy along. You&#39;ll choose your DVD and then set it up in the DVD player, all by yourself. After which, you will put the old DVD back to its original casing. You love to sing and play pretend these days. And you love to read. Sometimes, you will plead with Mama to let you play with the IPad for a while.<br /><br />These little steps are just little assertions of how independent you really are.<br /><br />By far, my darling, you are way ahead of your brothers when they were your age.

And you will&nbsp;giggle and walk away.<br /><br />You certainly act like both Daddy and me, both the good and the bad.<br /><br />If only you know that you are only twenty three months, darling.

"event","<p>The other day, my mother was casually asking J what he wanted to be when he grew up.<br /></p><p>&#39;A race car driver, Grandma&#39;, he said.<br /> <br />She, looking a little surprised said, &#39;No... you should try to be an accountant, or lawyer or doctor.&#39;<br /> <br />Listening to that conversation made me snigger because I was thinking, &#39;Hey Ma! Being a race car driver is&nbsp;a&nbsp;smart choice&nbsp;and honestly so much less work for more money and fame.&#39; LOL!<br /> <br />Anyway, I didn&#39;t&nbsp;add a word on their conversation but it did make me realise that the boy might like to see the F1 cars whiz by down at the Padang this weekend.<br /> <br />So, bright and early on Saturday morning, we went down to Raffles City Convention Center to buy tickets for D to bring the boys there. (whist they were in enrichment.)<br /> <br />After picking the kids up from their phonics class, we announced that we had a special treat for them if they behaved well that day.<br /> <br />(Which was really relative but still we had tickets so we all had to go, somehow.)<br />&nbsp;<br />You should see the look on J&#39;s face when he saw the tickets. It was absolutely gold.<br /> <br />He had this sparkle in his eyes and a skip to his step. Too cute!<br /> <br />And can I say that I think Singapore did a brillant job in the organization of the F1 event.<br /> <br />There were ushers scattered at every junction of the route towards the track, helpers at the MRT stations to guide you towards the right station for the correct gate, minimal fuss at the entrance.

<br />The secret to good hawker food is, <em>firstly</em>, to avoid the tourist crowd. We tried the famous Gurney Drive on our first evening and it was really just very average fare.<br />

Thank goodness, my parents arrived the following day and saved us all from bad Penang food. They brought us to this stretch&nbsp;of street lined with with mobile food carts&nbsp; called Jalan McAlister (close to the Sunway Hotel) and man! the food was just incredible. We had hae mee (prawn noodles), Lor mee, char kway teow, chendol, porridge, fried tofu &amp; chicken wings, desserts and that delicious A-Pom. It was quite a spread and we lost our waist lines that night to all that array of food.<br />

Another find we discovered was the corner coffee store at Jalan Penang. (If you are traveling, just tell the taxi driver that you want to go to the famous chendol store at Penang Road.)<br />
<br />This small nook of a place has only a few choices. A knock out char kway teow that had us waiting for 30 minutes. A pretty decent rojak. I didn&#39;t fancy the assam laksa. The husband thinks the goreng pisang in the little roadside cart was delish. And I liked the chendol - which had scores and scores of people queueing for that little bowl of jello filled gula melaka coconut dessert. (I suspect it&#39;s because it had a Phua Chu Kang photo there for a reason.<br />
<br />
Overall, it was a good trip to discover the authenticity of Penang food. Our verdict. It&#39;s all such an affordable steal. And our tummies agree wholeheartedly. =)"

We&#39;d filled a tub full of cool water and she happily lapped up the bath at the driveway.<br /><br />Carefree and fun.<br /><br />Just like how how we used to spend our childhood days.<br /><br />My sister commented that kids these days don&#39;t play as much outdoors as we used to as kiddos. Which is pretty true to a certain extent. These days, the boys play so much more in indoor playgrounds as compared to an open aired one. (So that us mummies can natter in an air conditioned environment.)<br /><br />D and I&nbsp;used to bring them to the beach once in a while but this has stopped lately due to all the weekend festivities that we have to attend.<br /><br />Perhaps once this wedding(s) season ends, we can resume that again. =)"

"event","I love my husband.

And one of the reasons, I love him is the freedom that he gives me.

One of the things that defines us is that whilst we like to be together, we love doing things apart as well.

It sounds kinda odd but it works for us.

The last two days have been filled with lots of girly chatter for me and lots of boys catch up for him.

I got to meet my gals (two different groups) for a good catchup over loads of food and tons of words. It was great because I had a ridiculous week filled with end to end activities that left me totally emptied out every night. It was exhausting!

And so sitting down with them and just chitchatting about anything that is under the sun makes me feel rejuvenated and all smiley once again. Aren&#39;t girlfriends the best thing ever?

My husband, on the other hand, was busy with a buck&#39;s night. His good pal is getting married and the man has been out with his old high school buddies planning and ,hopefully, painting the town red. He comes back with stories about the boys. He laughs and has this sparkle in his eyes, every time after meeting them.

It&#39;s really like food for our souls. =)

And it makes my heart skip because whilst we are very much a sticky couple who does everything together... it is such a great reminder that we allow each other to have individual time with other people that we love too. =)

That, my friends, is my tip of the day for a healthy relationship."

It's my cue for the start of birthday season.

All of my babies had birth dates close to a family member. It is funny how close they were to being born on the same day as their aunt or grandmother, and so it makes it so easy to remember all the other birthdays too.

Jakey turned 5 last week. Having been relegated to sharing birthdays with his older brother, we'd decided to throw him a party this year. 

A bunch of his friends and cousins came by to celebrate at Go Go Bambini. My lil fella was so thrilled being the birthday boy that he was grinning like a Cheshire cat all day. 

<a title=""Jake Turns 5 by Pixel81, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/65127737@N03/6096663484/""><img alt=""Jake Turns 5"" src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6074/6096663484_46399f3e1b_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""427"" /></a>

Then, we celebrated Dad's birthday a week later (although his birthday was earlier than the boy's.) =)

A milestone of measures. It was the turning of a decade. 
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/65127737@N03/6096714886/"" title=""Celebrating Dad's birthday by Pixel81, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6202/6096714886_72cd200fe9_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""427"" alt=""Celebrating Dad's birthday""></a>

Turns out the restaurant that we booked had only another table that night. So it was almost like private dining with generous servings to boot! I think we'd packed half of the food back home. Plus, the kids had heaps of space to run. Score!

Happy birthday to two of my favorite people in the whole wide world. =)"

There is a something about a Tokyo Bike.

It is simple. It is chic. And it gives a pretty darn smooth ride when you are out on the road.

When you head into their store down at Haji Lane, you will see a whole range of bikes with the most beautiful colors that will make your purchasing decision a whole lot harder. They all look so yummy!

I had such a hard time deciding.

In the end, I got a white classic bike, which is still massive &lt;3 today.

Last week, D and I attended their official launch.

A bunch of riders were gathered at the store where we then did a short ride up to Mt Emily where the party was held at Wild Oats.

It was all very chilled, the waiting staff were ready with welcome drinks when we arrived. We had time to mingle and vote for the best bike name. We got to meet the founder too. There were, also, plenty of canapes for us to sink our hungry teeth too. And they were simply delish! We had a good time that evening.

When you plan to buy a Tokyo bike, you get to meet lovely peeps at the store will offer you a trial ride, tell you come by and hang out, or just bring your bike in for a service. They are a great bunch! So hey! drop in to take a look and ask for either Jose or Barry. They will look after you and who knows? You might just like what you see. =)"

My little pumpkin pie is all of 21 months now. Just three months shy of turning two!

Brought her for a regular check up last week and the tyke is currently standing at 85cm and weighs 13.3kg, which puts her on 90th percentile.

<span style=""font-family:courier new;""><strong>SHE</strong> laughs a lot at this stage. Is very possessive of her mummy, especially when Daddy's around. Loves to sing all kinds of songs including the Bieber's Baby Baby. Gets into lil fist fights with her kor kors. Imitates everything her brothers do. Still adores her grandpa. Nuzzles her face into my neck when she wants to go to bed. Has already had a couple of terrible twos moments. Screams when she gets really mad. Dances the cutest moves to Elmo's songs. Is an old hand at working the ipad. Points to herself in pictures and say Mei Mei. Is totally fearless. And everything I ever dreamt of.

</span>Sometimes my heart pulls a little at how fast she is growing. And I want to bottle her up and keep her by my side forever. =)

Can you tell how much I love you, my baby girl? xx"

"event","Finally, we are done with the primary one registration for our boy.

When D and I first discussed the school options for the boys, we decided that we wanted to send them to a single sex school as their first formal school. We were quite keen on a well rounded education for them. Cause it is important to us that our kids would have an exposure to a myriad array of Co-cirriculum activities, especially sports. So that was what we set out to find.

After doing some research, and attending a few parental volunteering introductory sessions with the principals - which we didn't pursue, we decided on one. 

I spent the last few weeks monitoring the progress of the enrolment numbers and prayed that there would not be much changes to the data, as compared to the numbers of the previous years. Thankfully, things were pretty much constant.

Last week, bright and early on Wednesday morning, we headed off to the school with the boy in tow. 

Upon arrival, we were presented with a queue number and some forms to fill. The first question was, ""Do you live within 1 km?"", which we were. 

The boy, oblivious to everything that was going on, had his focus on the Ipad.
 
After submitting our forms and getting them checked, we were out of the door in 15 minutes, where we then brought the boy on a tour around the school. 

He looked pleased and a little scared because the grounds are bigger than his current kindergarten. Plus, it's going to be a whole new ball game where he has to make new friends and start all over again.

Three days on, we learnt that we had to ballot for a place in the school, which will take place a week on. Our odds were not too bad. 75 for 63. 

Still, I was internally freaking out because even though I had a Plan B, I was afraid we would have to ballot in that phase too, should this option not work out.

So this morning, the hubs and I were in an auditorium with a whole bunch of other people.

The Principal was announcing the names of the kids alphabetically when we walked in, and her staff were folding the ballot slips behind as she goes through the list. (Singaporeans get two slips, whilst PRs get one)

Soon, all the papers were in the square transparent box, which was subsequently given a quick toss.

8 parents got to pick 8 slips of papers each.

Soon, it was undergoing. You can start to slice through the tension in the air. Name after name was called out, and still the boy's name was not on the list!

I must admit that I was almost in major panic they went past the 40th mark. Then at no 49, the name of another 'Kaden' got called out! It was so close!

By this time, I was hovering on the notion that we have to consider Plan B.'Siao liao, siao liao', was running in my head!

However, 5 slots later, I heard a familiar name and, immediately and unconsciously, I let out a big gasp. 

It felt like the week's tension has been lifted. 

By the time, they got to the end, the last name that was called garnered a big sigh from that Mummy. 

And then it was all over.

12 parents walked out without a place. One mother was crying. A few were talking to the principal to discuss options.

The husband and I stayed a little to double check and then we walked out thanking God that our boy (and subsequently now his little brother) is now set for his Primary school education."

Freeze.<br />&nbsp;<br />To <strong>put together</strong> the drink, all you have to do is. <br />1. Fill a glass with a mix of normal and the lychee ice. <br />2. Garnish with some mint leaves and lychees. <br />3. Pour 1/4 of the glass with lychee syrup <br />4. Pour in the iced tea, sweetened to your liking. <br /></span><br />I'd reckon that it'd make&nbsp;a great drink for a garden party so this is going into my collection of recipes.<br /><br />Enjoy.</p>"

Whilst driving up to San Sebastian from Bilbao, we realise that there were signs pointing to Bordeaux. 

That was when we realised that the gorgeous San Sebastian is a two hour drive from the wine region of South of France. 

Hiaks! What luck? 

We had wanted to do a little bit of country traveling during our last trip to Paris but that was not to be. So this time round, we were quite determined to make our way there for a day trip. 

<a title=""Road Trip by Pixel81, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/65127737@N03/5988170080/""><img alt=""Road Trip"" width=""640"" height=""427"" src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6001/5988170080_ee76730e59_z.jpg"" /></a> 

So bright and early on a Sunday morning, we set off on our journey of vineyards. It didn't take us long to get to the border before we were in France. After driving past some famous beaches, we got to Bordeaux town in good time. 
<a title=""Walking Around Town by Pixel81, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/65127737@N03/5988138170/""><img alt=""Walking Around Town"" width=""640"" height=""427"" src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6006/5988138170_485aa1943a_z.jpg"" /></a> 

You will know when you hit Bordeaux. First thing you will see is a row of uniformed square buildings that just shows off its historical french architecture. I loved what I saw. The air felt different. The place has such a resort feeling that one feels at ease when as we drove through the town. 

But the thing is, being Sunday, most of the stores were closed. =( Plus, we were there in the morning so it wasn't really the perfect time to visit. 

<center><a title=""Breakfast! by Pixel81, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/65127737@N03/5987933652/""><img alt=""Breakfast!"" width=""640"" height=""640"" src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6007/5987933652_ccdc55f384_z.jpg"" /></a></center>
First thing we did was get breakfast. After two weeks of pintxos, I was just glad to have a glass of OJ with a cuppa latte and omelette for brekkie. Nothing fancy. It was so simply prepared but yet we inhaled everything within minutes. =) 

<center><lj-cut text=""Walking through the market""></center>After hopping into the Tourist Office (which is really just about the only thing open. Okay... I'm sounding bitter now =p), where they arranged our wine tours, we went on a quick walkabouts around town.

And had the good fortune to run into a Sunday market. 

There we had fresh oysters shucked to your order, served with a glass of white vino.

A store that sells paella. With more shellfish than rice. Isn't this a first? =)

Meandering through the market a little, we perused the stalls selling fresh produce, baked goods, flowers. I had to keep my fingers to myself because I was so tempted to buy something back to cook. It was so all so enticing. Can you tell that I love markets when I travel?

Don't get me wrong. 

I still love a good dinner with the husband and small gatherings with friends. But I'm slowly and surely edging away from big celebrations and crazy parties.

Last Saturday, the galfriend and the husband conspired to book a yacht for the morning so that we can all head out to sea, as a little birthday treat. I knew of the plans prior, but still it's such a thrill to be spending some time onboard a boat with my favorite people.

We got a chance to explore St John's Island for a bit but it was sooo hot that we retreated back to the boat for a BBQ prepared by the staff.

I turn thirty today.

And I am thankful for the life that I had so far. It is more than anything I ever dreamt or hope for.

A husband who still spoils me silly and gives me all the time & space to do what my heart desires. Three great kids who give me a run for my money but still I adore them so. A group of close knit friends whom I know that I can rely on, whether it's rain, hail or storm. My family who always stand by me whenever I need them, especially when it comes to last minute babysitting.

I have learnt that you cannot plan life. You can only go with the flow and hang on for dear life. 

So my only plan for my thirties is to keep healthy, happy and sane. (Well, as much as rearing three kids go.)

Two words. 

San Sebastian. 

A gorgeous beach town at the northern part of the Basque Country. 

The town that has the highest density of Michelin starred restaurants per square <strike>food</strike>foot. 

And a vibe that it is a town that is perpetually on holiday.

I was almost afraid that I would be bored by this leg of our travel plans but San Sebastian has other plans for me. It is unbelievably picturesque with a laidback lifestyle to boot. 

<center><lj-cut text=""A Little Walk Thru this Town""></center>The beach was filled to the brim with teenagers either playing paddle ball or volleyball. The boardwalk had an exhibition on the history of surfing. Gotta love the smell of the sea filling up the airways.

It was a busy weekend. Down by the esplanade, all the al fresco tables were taken and the streets were filled with streams of people. We had to fight the throes of people walking through town.

Bilbao had my heart the minute I stepped foot in it. 

An old industrial city that is the capital of the Basque Country. It used to be a busy commercial port that went through a phase of industrialization and has now transformed into a cultural hub with arts and gastronomy as its focus. 

There is something about Bilbao that captures your soul. The city is quaint and lovely.

I loved that the Nivea River runs through the city and people revolve part of their daily lives around it. Every day, we would walk pass it and see families bringing their children to play in the many playgrounds next to it. People will walk their dogs and we often spy rowers moving in warp speed moving past.

After a couple of days in Barcelona, we hopped, skipped and plane-d it to Madrid.

We were famished when we were done checking in, and armed with a map of the city together with some tips from the reception we went on a hunt for some food.

That was when we stumbled on upon this market that was just bustling with people.

I was really intrigued by the entire idea of a food market because, by and large, most markets that I have visited are produce markets with a food section. So this was, to me, a real pleasant find.

It was definitely one of my favourite moments in this trip!"

After sleeping the entire Saturday night away, we woke to a gorgeous Sunday morning that we spent at the Museo Picasso.

Right after some lunch we took the train to Park Guell, a UNESCO site, situated north of the city of Barcelona.

Park Guell was initially commisioned to be a private estate of houses but when it didn't work out, the state took over the land and converted it into a public park. It was meant to to provide a breather from the industrial fumes and a place for the locals to relax.

What we didn't expect was the hike up to the grounds of the compound in the hot weather. Thank God for escalators. It was a lifesaver for the very dehydrated tourists who wore inappropriate shoes. =)

However, once you get to the gates of the park, the panaromic view of the city is well worth the efforts spent.

What makes the park special is all the mosiac work in the seating area of the upper arena, that Gaudi comissioned, as well as the Grand Entrance. My favourite part is the stone viaducts. It was all that I wanted to see when I planned the trip.

We had a great time exploring the stone viaducts and just taking some time out of the city. It was very relaxing, despite the high volume of tourists in the area.

So... one of the reasons we were in Barcelona was to see the gothic architecture of the infamous Catalan architect, Antonio Gaudi.

Now we are not particularly architecture buffs but we do like traveling to see the different forms of architecture around.

First stop was the La Sagrada Familia. This was Gaudi's last project and the church has a combination of his gothic and modernism style.

We had to join a queue that went round the building when we got there but if you have time for just a few attractions, the La Sagrada Familia is definitely one to visit. Gaudi's genius is honestly for show over here.

And the building is not even completed. There are scaffolding around it and it is estimated that it will be completed around 2030. Guess it warrants a visit back to see how it is then.

This is definitely Gaudi's masterpiece. At the entrance, we got an audio guide to share (cheapos la, we!) and the thorough explanations helped us with the different backgrounds of the rooms that he had designed.

You will notice the gothic outlook of the church when you step out of the metro station but inside, it is all modern and slick. And this was all designed in 1883 but yet looks thoroughly current for its times.

We'd spent hours there before heading back to the hotel to conclude Day 1 in Barcelona. =)

There have been times where we just let our guard down and just explore the nooks and corners of this town where we were met with little surprises. <br /><br />I must admit that being on vacation encourages that because, being in mostly mom mode, it's really getting from point A to point B in the fastest way possible all the time. So this time round, we really just took our time to savour the sights. <br /><br />Makes for a good time to relax with the husband and bask in 100% attention. Something that we definitely don't have when the kiddos are around. Love it. Great relationship tip, I must say. <br /><br />One area we loved was the Born area. There are museums and tapas and shopping. Plus it's quite mediveal with the high city walls. Simply gorgeous.

The orange signboarded Pinotxo Bar, situated right at the entrance of the market, serves freshly prepared 'homestyled' food to anyone that can grab one out of the fifteen coveted seats available. [which explains why there's always someone breathing down your neck when you eat. =)]

And even though it's batshit busy, they will not rush you through your meal. Instead, you are welcome to a second coffee and, by the time you are through, most likely you are good to move on to the next item of your itinerary.

My best tip. Get there before 9am and also do your research on their menu online.

Great way to start the day. And here's what we had.

"event","The husband and I just returned from a fortnight in Spain.

The idea started when he asked what I would like for my 30th and I said, ""Paris"" but he suggested ""Spain"".

Tapas, Gaudi and Europe is always a good idea. So off we went.

We landed blurry eyed in Barcelona after a 16 hour flight, and after dropping the luggage off at the hotel. [After walking like 8 blocks to the hotel] It was food that we sought. And where better than the La Bouqueria market down at La Rambla.

The market was already bustling at 11am in the morning. The array of fresh produce is incredible. Plus the vendors take great pride in the stall's decor. We took some time wandering around the market and it was a little hard to resist buying stuff cause everything looked fresh and the spread was much more than what you see here in SG.

Slapped on the sunblock and threw some beach toys for them to muck around the sand for a lazy Sunday arvo.

Very much like what we used to do so very often in the good old Melbourne summer.

And when they were all packed up to head home, we had all three kids dozing off in the car. Best kinda day, I'd say. </div>"

One night after her bath, I noticed that her smile was rather crooked and it got me quite worried. After confirming with the GP (who's D's uncle) that it is bells palsy, we went off to the A&amp;E of KK which they immediately decided to ward her. (Note: KK's A&amp;E is really understaffed and thus the amount of care given is not optimal) <br /><br />Now that is where it got tricky. It was Friday evening and the general plan was to keep her in the cot for TWO DAYS. Which D was not in agreement to because he knew that she would scream the ward down in less than hour (which was what happened.) <br /><br /><a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CCKy9OkCGns/TcX5GQG79uI/AAAAAAAACZo/J9LWDiay79o/s1600/047.JPG""><img id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5604159197131044578"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 400px; display: block; height: 400px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CCKy9OkCGns/TcX5GQG79uI/AAAAAAAACZo/J9LWDiay79o/s400/047.JPG"" /></a><center>Watching youtube whilst waiting for the consultants</center><br /><br />So the registrar spoke to her senior and based on past experience, they knew that it would take time for the nerve to heal so K was released and we'd brought her home to zzz. <br /><br />It's been three weeks now and it's much better so I'm hoping it will go back to normal soon.

Time is an amazing tool.

Whilst it feels like forever, it has also been such a blink of an eye.

I guess when you have been together for quite awhile (almost a decade with our dating days), it makes time pass a little bit quicker than usual. Plus, three kids does make everything go faster like clockwork.

So in the evening, we shelved our fancy dinner plans for a pole dancing competition which was wow wow wow! No regrets there.

Followed by this simple meal at<a href=""http://www.artichoke.com.sg/""> Artichoke</a>, where Chef Bjorn is always happy to <span id=""SPELLING_ERROR_0"" class=""blsp-spelling-corrected"">accommodate</span> our appetites and whip up amazing <span id=""SPELLING_ERROR_1"" class=""blsp-spelling-corrected"">Moorish</span> stuff for us. It was <span id=""SPELLING_ERROR_2"" class=""blsp-spelling-error"">delish</span>!

But it wouldn't be complete without a picture to see where we are six years down the road.

Active. Very much awake from the morn till the time his head hits the pillow with nary a nap in sight. It's quite hard to keep him still for a minute. <br /><br />These days, he's very much into his friends. He sings the songs they sing. He talks the way they do. It's funny how important friends are to him at this stage. I guess it's gonna weigh more as he gets older. <br /><br />Needless to say, along with the need to be independent, he's also been quite defiant. It's part of the growing up process but it's quite a tough part to manage because he only tends to listen when I get mad. Headache headache. <br /><br />But the saving grace is always at the end of the night when he gets tucked into bed, that he gives his mother a big hug and a tender kiss. <br /><br />And just like that, he becomes my little boy, again. (Well, till the next morning!)"

I must admit that I wasn't really looking forward to it because Japan has been on my mind for ages and it was truly disappointing when it didn't happen.

However, we did have a good time in Hong Kong.

The landscape has changed so much in the last seven years but we had such a good time just eating our way through the city and shopping, of course!

Getting to the city from the airport was easy peasy. If you travel in groups of two or more, you get a discount on the Airport Express. Buy your tickets and 24 minutes later, you are right in the heart of the city.

We stayed at this boutique hotel in Wellington Street, on Hong Kong Island. It was tiny but so accessible to all the hotspots of HK. LKF and Soho was 5 minutes away. We had eateries at our doorstep. Plus, there was shopping everywhere! IFC was a 10 minute walk away and Queens Street Central is 5 minutes away. It was perfect!

It was such a good break for us! I can't believe it's been that long since we've last been there but it's definitely on my shortlist for our next holiday!"

Got up at 630 and dashed off to the gym for an early morning workout. 

By 8 in the morn, I was done with breakfast and a workout. Happy me, much! 

It has been a crazy two weeks of packing and unpacking. 

Thank goodness for movers from Helping Hands who did the entire moving. They literally came in and swept all the boxes off the ground and we did two loads in 4 hours. Epic fast, I'd say. 

That morning, I was reminded that kindness begets kindness. We knew that being a morning job, the movers would probably have little to eat so we bought drinks and lunch for them. And, in return, they did an extra drop off for a fridge at my mum's and charged us only a quarter load for the second trip. It was a pleasant surprise when we saw the charges.

Anyway, I'm hoping to clear all the clutter by the end of the week and then it's back to home cooking. Eating out has been rather detrimental to the tummy. I'm feeling all the sodium so, hopefully, things will settle down soon and we can go back to normal life. 

Till then, I need to find time to sit and write about Hong Kong.</span></div>"

"event","It's pretty clear to us that our baby is, well, no longer one.

At 16.5 months, she has enough tricks up her sleeve to amuse us daily.

She had a little playground adventure one evening last week.

First, she let go of my hand. Then she gingerly approached the steps and once she's successful in climbing up the steps by herself... she was off!

Straight to the edge of the slide and pushed her lil diapered bum down.

Here's the video! (Pardon my excitement!)
<center><lj-embed id=""6""/></center>

It was the most amusing thing to watch and I almost had tears in my eyes about how grown up she is. She's so cute that I wanna just hold her up and squish her.

Can you tell that I just adore her so!"

<p>""It sounds old-fashioned but I think, when you're someone like Jamie, you need a wife like me. I'm in the background, making sure that the kids are in bed and everyone's happy. There's nothing I'd rather do,"" she said.</p><p>-Jooles Oliver</p></blockquote>
I have been thinking lately about my daily life.

Life has been so busy that my thoughts have taken a backseat to my kids' schedule.

It's funny because when you are sunk this deep in the throes of motherhood, it's very hard to see past the day to day running of the household.

And I realise that what Jooles Oliver says is true.

If you ask me seven years ago to look into the future and see this picture, I would've laughed and said it is a crazy illusion.

That said, her quote holds true because I have kids. If I didn't, it would be a totally different story altogether.

The husband has been fanatically busy at work. He literally steps out of the house at about 9 in the morning and I'd usually see him twelve hours later, if I am lucky.

Some nights, he's out having his business meetings and I wouldn't see him till the next day cause by the time he creeps into bed, I am well and truly in dreamland.

When I was pregnant with my first baby, I was pretty confident in doing the working mommy thing. I knew that I was going to spend the first year with my baby and head back to work. Next thing I knew, I fell pregnant again and my maternity leave got extended to a span of 22 months.

Initially, it took some getting used to. The loss of my personal income. The change in the wardrobe. My colleagues who were such a good mates in the corporation.

Gradually, my life started to focus on my kids. I guess it wasn't all that hard because you just fall in love with your own munchkins. Any fatigue gives way to the toothless smiles that they bestow upon you.

I went back to work when J was 11 months old. We'd hire a nanny to look after them during the day. The boys then went to daycare once a week. This arrangement carried out till I left. And that was the move back to SG.

The initial plan was to work but the idea got scrapped when I fell pregnant with K. And, again, I found myself wanting to be there for the first year of her life.

So it's back to full time mommying again.

In between ferrying them to school, prepping their meals and supervising their schoolwork and violin practice, the question I get the most is, ""How do you cope?""

Well... Firstly, I am thankful for the help that I have. Either from my husband, family or helper. I guess when you have three kids, an extra pair of hands is always a welcome notion.

Secondly, I keep busy by planning my own activities out without the kids. It could be my twice-a-week pole class or going to the gym. Lunch with the gals. Or even a quiet coffee. Some zen time always do me some good in my books.

Thirdly, I make time to be alone with the husband. Dinner dates are essential. We try to do it once a week or fortnight. We catch up on each other's day after the kids go to bed. We love to catch movies over the weekend. And, just small little gestures like texting and short phone calls during the day.

Lastly, I keep myself updated with the world. I try not to be a slob when I do the school run (unless I'm really really tired) and I read anything that I get my hands on. My girlfriends have been really good in keeping me up to date with current affairs.

In the end, it all boils down to the acceptance of my choice. I chose to be a full time mom and I choose to be happy doing it. =) Afterall, a fellow mom said, ""It doesn't matter if you are working or not, you will never regret spending that much time with your kids."" <p></p>"

Kate has been quite the animal lover, lately. 

She has this really shy approach whenever she sees furry little things coming down her way. After spying the little creature in a suspicious manner, she will dance a little jiggle and giggle as she gets closer to the pet. 

It is akin to a little lion dance but it is, in fact, my daughter who's just so adorable in her love for dogs and cats.

"event","<div align=""left"">3 years ago, D and I packed our boys into a 4 seater camper van and did a road trip around the South Island of New Zealand. <br /><br />It was a mad trip. We drove A LOT during the eleven days and then found a camping site at night to hook up the electricity to the van for heating purposes. I gave up after 5 nights and we got an apartment for the rest of the trip. I won't say that I am keen to explore the campervan route again BUT New Zealand can happen for me any time and any day. In fact, I would have no quelms retiring in that place. <br /><br />There is everything to love there. The fresh air. The breathtaking scenery. The All Blacks! Vineyards. Fresh food and lots of sports to do. Well... if I had my way, I would love to visit again. Sooner, rather than later. <br /><br />So it was devastating to hear about the second earthquake in Christchurch this morning. This time, a whole lot more serious than the last one , which was only six months back. My heart goes to the people. <br /><br />For now, I am only hoping that we can have thse memories again.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div><p align=""center""><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZX3hRUoP_SA/TWMggGGj-sI/AAAAAAAACVM/j0tM8FuQwgM/s1600/kaikoura3.jpg""><img id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576336499380845250"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; width: 400px; height: 224px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZX3hRUoP_SA/TWMggGGj-sI/AAAAAAAACVM/j0tM8FuQwgM/s400/kaikoura3.jpg"" /></a></p><center>Crayfish by the roadside @ Kaikoura</center><div align=""center""><br />&nbsp;<a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8YxqdXBuXgg/TWMgfyoYUII/AAAAAAAACVE/RLtcYlNgQMI/s1600/hamnersprings9.jpg""><img id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576336494153977986"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; width: 400px; height: 173px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8YxqdXBuXgg/TWMgfyoYUII/AAAAAAAACVE/RLtcYlNgQMI/s400/hamnersprings9.jpg"" /></a></div><center>Campervans in Hamner Springs</center><p align=""left""><a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EnGe6K0k0FQ/TWMi1wVttMI/AAAAAAAACVU/_iHFQPhPprc/s1600/blenheim27.jpg""><img id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576339070519194818"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 400px; display: block; height: 225px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EnGe6K0k0FQ/TWMi1wVttMI/AAAAAAAACVU/_iHFQPhPprc/s400/blenheim27.jpg"" /></a></p><center>Vineyard @ Blenheim</center><p><img id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576339691062230834"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 400px; display: block; height: 225px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lJ6x693tpto/TWMjZ4Cs_zI/AAAAAAAACVc/dOEmeWtaZTc/s400/allblacks10.jpg"" /></p> <center>Main man, Richie McCaw</center><br /><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NZoYftMmNkU/TWMk0uUR85I/AAAAAAAACVs/jVQIsqB4_3w/s1600/franzjosefglacier21.jpg""><img id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576341251819697042"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 400px; display: block; height: 225px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NZoYftMmNkU/TWMk0uUR85I/AAAAAAAACVs/jVQIsqB4_3w/s400/franzjosefglacier21.jpg"" /></a> <center>Top of the Franz Josef Glacier</center><br /><p align=""center""><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6_KVBkk0WgE/TWMbJQdOLbI/AAAAAAAACU8/b0rPCXzBwZA/s1600/franzjosefglacier45.jpg""><img id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576330609465109938"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; width: 225px; height: 400px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6_KVBkk0WgE/TWMbJQdOLbI/AAAAAAAACU8/b0rPCXzBwZA/s400/franzjosefglacier45.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The tail end of the glacier</p>"

"event","We all make mistakes sometimes, <em>no</em>?

Well, it happened to me last night.

I was busy talking to my husband when I was online booking tickets to ""Black Swan.""

It was nine. And the show was at nine forty.

So we had literally slightly less than half an hour to get down to town to catch the show.

It was like Gran Turino.

After hastily dropping me off at the cinema, I ran up to the box office and literally just had time to catch a breath before presenting the credit card to the customer service lady.

Then the bomb dropped.

There was no booking?!

So she asked for the booking reference number.

Confidentally, I found myself handing over my Iphone over to her with the confirmation screen of my purchase.

She casually said,""Mam, The booking is for *insert said name of cinema*.""

After mouthing some words of shock, I called the husband in my state of disbelief. lol! Obviously, I was too distracted by him to book the right show at the right place. =/

In my mother's words, I was ""<em>so stupid, lah.</em>""

Thank God, the manager allowed the original transaction to be refunded and reissued my tickets without much drama. Even though she did mentioned, this was done out of goodwill. But I was a happy lark. I knew I would've easily been told to buy new tickets.

The clincher was we had two hours to kill.

And what<em> did</em> we do?

Eat, <em>of course</em>.

In a funny twist of fate, we finally had time to try out Ippudo. Yumz.

In my opinion, that was the good out of the blue for this blur queen on a random Saturday night."

"event","We didn't have any dinner plans for Valentine's this year. <br /><br />Strangely, whilst we have been quite consistent in celebrating both our dating and wedding anniversaries with nice dinners, Valentine's has always been a random dinner for us. Sometimes we celebrate it, sometimes we don't. <br /><br />So this year, it was meant to be a normal one. <br /><br />But, somehow, it suddenly dawned onto me during lunch that it doesn't take much for me to whip something nicerthanusual up in a short notice (plus it would make my husband a really happy man) so I got my act together and shopped for all the ingredients, in between the time my boys were in school and in enrichment class. <br /><br />I got back at 7 and then in a spot of an hour and a bit, whipped up the following dinner. With the help of the husband, of course! He's always been my best sous chef. <br /><br />We had the following for dinner tonight. <br /><br /><a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QsA0QcUqWAY/TVlqa8wzijI/AAAAAAAACQI/hEs10c0Op2c/s1600/058.JPG""><img id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5573603025067674162"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 216px; display: block; height: 400px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QsA0QcUqWAY/TVlqa8wzijI/AAAAAAAACQI/hEs10c0Op2c/s400/058.JPG"" /></a> <center>Jamie O's mushroom soup with cheese twists, courtesy of the post by <lj user=""am_klutz""/>&nbsp;.</center><br /><div><a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SAegnZObB3Q/TVlqS5FxxfI/AAAAAAAACQA/iC8jRESdIE4/s1600/066.JPG""><img id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5573602886642943474"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 400px; display: block; height: 400px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SAegnZObB3Q/TVlqS5FxxfI/AAAAAAAACQA/iC8jRESdIE4/s400/066.JPG"" /></a> <center>Grilled pork chops with Chopped Salad</center><br /><br /><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sulT7Gp4Xkg/TVlp9Ym8QSI/AAAAAAAACP4/2usnWz-Pa_s/s1600/069.JPG""><img id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5573602517146419490"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 400px; display: block; height: 300px; cursor: hand"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sulT7Gp4Xkg/TVlp9Ym8QSI/AAAAAAAACP4/2usnWz-Pa_s/s400/069.JPG"" /></a> <center>Finished with chocolate dipped strawberries</center></div><br />It made me happy that he liked the dinner heaps.

It has been such an incredible journey travelling along life with you."

"event","The other day, my cousin had a prata party at his place. <br /><br />It is the kind of party we like because 1. The kids were having a ball of a time with their cousins 2. We had both hands free to eat 3. We get to mingle with the other adults and talk. <br /><br />So, anyway, it's baby season cause there were babies of all ages and sizes there. <br /><br />And I got lucky cause I got the chance to hold a three month old little gal. <br /><br />Ahh... the feeling of <em>deja vu.</em> <br /><br />You know, where they are still tiny and won't wiggle in your arms, plus they are still pre stranger-anxiety phase. <br /><br />And I thought, &quot;How nice to have another one to hold, again?&quot; <br /><br />Especially if it's a girl.<em> *major swoon* <br /></em><br />Then my husband burst my little bubble by saying, &quot;Hunni, You are on your own for the fourth.&quot; Hur hur. <br /><br />Ok, I <em>geddit</em>. <em>I geddit.</em> <br /><br />There are no more little me's coming out of moi. <br /><br />Nice to hold, <em>la</em>. But I kinda like my full night's rest now. And I am at a stage where I can go do my things without fretting about the tykes. Plus, three healthy kids is such a gift, already. I don't wanna push it. <br /><br />Unless, God plans it. We are not going to pursue it. =) <br /><br />But I'm always open to a cuddle or two of all these newborn milkiness....<br />"

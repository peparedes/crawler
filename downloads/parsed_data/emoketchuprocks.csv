"event","well heres my shit from yesterday for whoever may care...most of it pplies to today as well.

*so please forgive what i have done no you cant stay mad at the setting sun i mean we all get tired i mean eventually there is nothing left to do but sleep*
i have accepted this fact and moved on.gotton the fuck over it.but what do i do now?i mean everybody needs somethin in life but what do we have when we sleep?maybe thats the point....that i can cling onto to the fact that it is all fantasy and be conforted by the fact that its all temporary.everything goes away.everything dies.nothing lasts.that scares me sometimes.i want something stable.something i can hold onto and depend on but everything goes away.'dont stay just so you can be the only one to say they never left me'...the thing that scares me most is that i do trust him and love him so much.i do depend on him.when he's not around i dont feel like me anymore.i need him more than i have ever needed anyne.even michael i knew hated me so i didnt let myself need him.he is the one who usually needed me...for grades,sex,and avoiding expulsion and whatnot.but with him its an equal thing.im so scared.scared to be alone.scared to be hurt. scared of being wrong....thinkin that its all ok.i can be around him for days and not even get remotely annoyed.i love him so fuckin much.but love can hurt you so bad as we all know.its almost like asking to get hurt.it hurts so much you think you'll die from the pain but the saddest part of all is that you dont die from it.death is so welcoming most of the time.there are few things worth living for and yet every little rock seems worth living for when he is around.he makes life ok and that scares me too.nothin comforts me as much as he does.not even the blood he took the place of.he wont let me do that anymore.understandable but it doesnt change the fact that when he isnt around i still want to....but that 'im dissappointed in you' look he gives me all the time comes into my head and it stops me.....i wake up missing him...wishing he was holding me....i dont like being alone.....he is my best friend....fuckin a  i need new meds soon....next thing ya know im gonna start writtin poems and shit.....feelin wears me out."

""The Night Will Go As Follows""

In a romantic fashion 
I will experiment with my fear right before her eyes 
And every smile that's unveiled will be soaked 
In my nervous charm 

Then I'll say 
""Is everything alright? 
There's been a few things I've been meaning 
To let go of tonight"" 
And she will say 
""Everything's just fine 
So you can put an end to your worrying mind"" 
And then our lips will collide 

The August sky will then bare witness 
To a brand new chapter with torn up pages 
When the planets align, I can feel the gates opening 
To my courage 
As I proceed to run my fingers through her hair 
And forget everyone who's jaded, 'cause they don't matter 
And I don't care 

In a confident fashion 
I will admit my deepest and darkest to her 
And every gaze across the table 
Will send my unsuspecting body into shock 

Then I'll say 
""Would you like to go inside? 
And forget the world and the rules 
By which we are to abide"" 
And she will say 
""There's nothing I want more"" 
As we step into the room, turn off the lights and close the door 

The August sky will then bare witness 
To a brand new chapter with torn up pages 
When the planets align, I can feel the gates opening 
To my courage 
As I proceed to run my fingers through her hair 
And forget everyone who's jaded, 'cause they don't matter 
And I don't care 
No, 'cause they don't matter 
And I don't care 

Brash and hopeful 
That my luck will not perish tonight 
When the overcast tries to kill me 
It's your slow motion rain 
That falls warm on my neck that keep me alive 

Brash and hopeful 
That my luck won't perish tonight 
And when the overcast tries to kill me 
It's your slow motion rain 
That falls warm on my neck that keep me alive 

Brash and hopeful 
That my luck will not perish tonight 
And when the overcast tries to kill me 
It's your slow motion rain 
That falls warm on my neck that keep me alive 

Consider this song a testament 
Of my devotion to your sacharrine scent 
And to be completely honest 
You're not like all the rest 
You're not like all the rest 

Consider this song a testament 
Of my devotion to your sacharrine scent 
And to be completely honest 
You're not like all the rest 
You're not like all the rest 
Oh no, you're not like all the rest 
You're not like all the rest 
You're not like all the rest"

"event","oi its sunday and here i am......waiting for my grandma to come get me. my fuckin reprot card came last night and so yeah.....luckily jeff was on my side and slipped my mom a few drinks befor i got home so she wasnt all that hard to deal with.....basically i cant drive until my grades get up and i have to show her my math hw every night so yeah...not too horrible unless next time i ask to do somethin she pulls some lame trick like ""o your grades aren't good enough"" or whatevs.i have to see my dad today too. i hate him and my mom said something yesterday that made me think about it......she said that some things are just not worth it which i have known all along but im really startin to apply it to my dad.whats the point in tryin? its not like he notices when i do try and he is obviously ok with me not trying so whatevs...got alot to think about

yesterday was ok besides the report card part.adams dad picked me up at 10 am(adam called and woke me up at 7:30)and so i went to his house and went back to bed...he still wasnt feelin good so just took it easy for the day....that most exertion he demonstrated was walkin to cheveron with me befor his mom got us....
it was his grandmas birthday so we went to his uncles house at like 4.we stayed there until like 9.it was cool cuz adam has a lil 3 year old cousin aho i played with most of the night...it was kinda cute to watch adam get all jealous of a 3 year old.lol...the lil kid hugged me goodbye and adam was like""i cant watch!"" oi i love that boy....tehehe and he loves me....muahahaha...ok ill stop that now......

i talked to his brother about the whole ciggarette incidednt the other day and he was pretty reasonable about it. basically adam just has to find a way to bring up the fact that he quit smokin to his dad.doesnt have to say when or why or anything.....so yeah.adams still mad but he is happy that i improved the situation a little bit....i tried at least right?oi i dunno

so yeah right now i dont feel so hot and i really really really want to smoke myself stupid for a few hours that way i dont have to deal with my dad.he better give me some money.i definately need it.so i should be back here around 11 or 12 and i have to work at 1 but should be done by 3:30 so yeah if anybody wants to hang just lemme know...

Randy is this cool 28 year old that works at 3 different lodges.he is almost always drunk,stoned or both and he loves to board.Travis is 24 and is fun to talk to.drinks alot but has a good heart.he wants 12 kids and has one already and is waitin for the 2nd one.they gave me the chaka na.essentially it means kick ass but i have changed it to be more than that(KT:accordin to adam&nbsp;you should recognize this as the same type of thing as 'fuckin squared')whatevs..i love the saying, it makes me happy,and yes you can laugh if i say it in public.unless you understand the roots though i say respect the chaka na and do not abuse its power.</P>

<P><EM>""Ah My Sea Of Adoring Fans....""</EM></P>
<P>*dead silence*</P>
<P>Good old NCW jokes, they never do get old. So hey everyone, I figure that after all this time, I might as well update SOMETHING, and since I'm having trouble uploading my FTP server&nbsp;for <A href=""http://www.thencwonline.net"">www.thencwonline.net</A> I'd just brush the dust off this thing, pull it out of mothballs and update on here.</P>
<P>So for long time viewers, first time callers- let me clarify some things. My life is infact a television series. Don't believe me? Go watch <EM>The Truman Show</EM> and tell me it's not possible (just leave me in denial will ya?). Anyway, over the years my ""show"" has changed in various ways, with the <FONT color=#ffcc66>golden age </FONT><FONT color=#000000>being around 2000-2002. This was the time when I was riding high working at RF Video (pre child molestation of course- I think), doing wrestling shows every weekend, hanging out with the crew, and just having fun. I met the girl of my dreams in the form of Keith's ex-girlfriend Carolyn, fell in love with her before I even knew it (everyone else however, seemed to know), and had a bumpy, yet wonderful, eventually horrible, but never regretful&nbsp;breakup (great television folks). </FONT><FONT color=#000000>Of course there was drama, but that's what makes a great TV show. </FONT></P>
<P>Since then everything has changed dramatically.</P>
<P>RF Video closed up shop at the Emerald Mall... I got a job working for the 99 restaurant as a host, and eventual waiter... NCW shut down due to money and ego's (not eggos)... Friends faded away (some because wrestling was more important, others because pussy became more important)... As I eluded to Carolyn and I had our nasty breakup, and even more recently I've moved out of my Mom's house (aka the CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE)... Oh and Tighe got married to Rhyanedd.</P>
<P>Looking back it's been a mindfuck to see where our lives have gone, and how far we've come. I've decided to try my hand at screenwriting, and would love to get into the film industry someday. After going to a seminar/workshop late last year, I'm hoping to take a trip to California in the fall just to see whats out there, while I continue to hammer out my 2nd draft of my screenplay, based on the ups and downs of said <FONT color=#ffcc33>golden age</FONT><FONT color=#000000>. Moving out was a huge deal, especially without the safety net of my Mom, who's been a big help in my life. Finally the biggest changes&nbsp; has come with the loss of my close friends, like Sean and John, who have moved onto other pastures for better or worse. Luckily JR, who I got a job at 99 for, has come back into the show as a full time cast member, while I've made some other real good friends working at The Nines.</FONT></P>
<P>Basically I just wanted to check up quickly with everyone. I'm still in the process of moving so updates will be sporadic, but plentiful I promise.</P>
<P>Now quick Richmond Black needs a babyface to hug so he can BBD various heels. See NCW jokes DON'T get old!</P>

Looking at this, I haven't updated it in forever, and since I've primarily been using my new site on the web (http://www.thencwonline.net/jcmarxxx) as a journal of sorts, I haven't given this thing much thought in the last oh.. Year or so. 

I think I may start updating THIS more often, and use my regular website as a informational stop for all JC Marxxx fanatics (kinda like what MTE does). I will put special entry's and thoughts on there, as well as pictures, musings, et al, while using this little bitty for random ""news"" updates. I use that term loosely BTW. 

Okay well I think I'm done for now. I will talk to everyone when I do,

Pu-eace!"

"event","Well I haven't updated my livejournal in some time, even if the prying of a certain beautiful red head hasn't pursuaded me to update this lil gimmick ""in a minute.""

However since I have my regular stop on the net, http://www.geocities.com/JCMarxxx and I do weekly (almost) updates, I don't usually have much use for this. But then there are days like this when I havent even started a commentary and I just feel like typing, <i>something</i>, anything.

So I am like drunk happy these days. Carolyn has been home for six weeks and I'd be damned if I said I didn't see much of her. I got some mucho Carolyn time which was great! It's odd to me that we have been together for four months now, as bad as it sounds this has been my longest relationship yet, but the best thing is it's with her. 

I may actually have a new job finally, with 99 Restaurants where my Aunt Flulie works. I would be a door server, but it pays $8.00 an hour which I think rocks. 

MTE, Ruy, Carolyn, and I where discussing time travel Thursday night, and it became a heated discussion (AKA Nerd Alert!). Check out MTE's livejournal at http://www.livejournal.com/users/mte for his time travel theories among other things.

I have no shows until mid February. I like vacations :)

I have begun typing out a new draft to my screenplay ""Proof Of Death"". Carolyn thinks its real good, but again, is that the overly optimistic girlfriend just saying that?

Ruy and I went to go see LOTR the other night. It wasnt that bad, but he was pissed he paid $8.75 for a cliffhanger. Umm it was a trilogy! lol

Well thats all I got.
Later"

"event","Another livejournal update? I must be REALLY bored. Or drunk. Yeaa, thats the ticket.

But seriously, what do I have to talk about? Nothing at all. Thats the beauty of livejournal, when I have nothing serious to say, this is the best place to babble. I have two wrestling shows this weekend. First Friday in Bangor, ME I will be making my first appearance for Rampage Pro Wrestling, and I am really looking forward to it. I haven't really been into it for the last few months (a real shocker I know! Sheesh as of late <i>everyone</i> doesn't have a heart for the business) but for some reason these upcoming dates I have are inspiring me to do my best work possible, which I plan on trying out to the Bangor crowd on Friday. Sunday afternoon is Big East Wrestling in Bridgewater, MA and I am real excited about that, albeit for ulterior motives. Sunday morning Carolyn will be coming over since she is gonna be home for six whole friggin weeks! Sweet. Anyway with her in toe I plan on goin to Bridgewater for BEW's sophmore show, and I am looking forward to that too. I haven't been to Bob's since I worked for SCCW back in May 2000 as apart of ""Sexual Harassment"". I had a ton of fun at the Bob's shows and got some really great heat, plus got to work my first ""name"" there Brutus The Barber Beefcake (although the impact lessons when friggin <b>Zanic</b> got his head shaved by him too >:I ). On this show I will be managing my tag team of The Revolution Chris Venom, Legion Freakin Cage, ""Dudez A' Plenty"". LOL seriously though it should be fun, so if your free check it out, http://www.bigeastwrestling.com for more information! Go now!

I am quite relieved Carolyn is coming home for such an extended break, because I feel very lost without here. I know how much Tim rags on me for being to ""happy"" in reference to Carolyn, but she makes me real happy, and we always have fun together, and I've never been anything but ecstatic when she is around. It really irked me that the second we got ""close"" she was on her way to Keene for school, and I've been asked enough if it's too much with the distance, but honestly she is very much worth it, and I think the waiting makes us stronger, and more greatful for eachother being in our lives. 

Plus she says cootch, bonus.

My birthday is next week. I hate making a big deal out of it with it being so close to the holidays. It honestly hasn't been the same since I was 13 and got my party at the Dream Machine in the Lincoln Mall. I get depressed at certain times around my birthday, since sometimes I think my Family is preoccupied (which they are, der it's X-Mas!) but this year could be worse with my Sister's problems overshadowing anything else in my house. I've kinda given up on birthday's, but thats cool, at least I can buy porn and lotto tickets these days.

MTE's birthday should be made into National Wacky And Zany Day. His b-day is exactly a week after mine BTW, December 28th.

Well thats all for now, I will talk to everyone soon enough!"

"event","Okay I need to vent. I haven't been this angry in a long time. I am Irish, and by definition I have a hot temper. My entire family demonstrates it. If you ever knew my Grandmother, she yells when she's in a GOOD mood. My Mom, like me, gets hot over the littlest things. I have been traumatized forever thanks to our annual X-Mas tree purchasing thanks to my Mom letting ""her temper"" get the better of her. A sight to be seen I promise you.

Anyway, tonight after I got back from the movies with Sean (Chris Venom), I got an e-mail from my girlfriend to call her as soon as possible. Of course I did, and she was quite upset. I am not going to get into details because I'm not the kind of person who puts every little detail of my life on a webpage, even if it's not my personal information, just because you like to make people angry. Nevertheless I hate it when people spread information they know NOTHING about. If it's coming from 3rd string information which obviously isn't accurate, why not go to the source? Why wait until I sign off the computer to start a rumor which has NO validation? Because you want your ex-girlfriend back just to fuck her over again? 

Some people move on with there life, other people dwell. Why must these people dwell? I used to be a dweller, somehow I moved on with my life. I'd like to think I am a different person than I was a year ago. I'd like to think I've matured. I have many people to thank for that, including one of the most important people in my life today, Carolyn.

Where someone gets off calling her a ""rat"" is as insulting as calling my Mother a rat because she went to a indy show and Diamond Dave Donovan flirted with her. Does she go around shows slapping people in the ass and sleeping around the lockeroom? Does she flock to every show waiting for the boys to come out so she can fondle them? Thats what a damn RAT is. 

Ya know what? Carolyn fufills every desire I've ever had. She fufills my greatest fantasy that I've ever imagined. She makes me HAPPY. She puts me in a place I never thought I could be in, contentment. I've never felt this way about a girl before, and it just makes someone crazy so he has to stir the pot and try to break us up. It is going to take more than that to push her away from me. This fine fellow has a girlfriend, so you would think he has moved on. NO CLEARLY not. Get over it and move on. 

*whew* Okay I am done venting for now."

I dont really have anything of any relevance to say, so I am just going to ramble.

- Please tell me I am not the only one who hates Lenny Kravitz. I was watching him on Extra last night. Oh he is so smug.

- I got to watch DAYS today, and Austin proposed to Sammi. Doh! I really hope evil Sammi comes back soon or we are in for some boring *ahem* days ahead. Plus I wanna see more Jack & Jennifer!

- On the subject of soaps, I HATE Passions. It's so damn repetitive it makes me sick. If they recap there whole storyline everytime they talk to someone one more time I am going to snap. Ethan is a moron, by the way.

- Me and my Mom where laughing about how I was a California Raisin when I was little. Man I was a dork.

- I need to get my haircut.

- Man I miss Carolyn.

- Scrubs is my new favorite show on the air, and I always try to catch it. You should do the same. 

- Funny how more involved I get with indy wrestling the more I hate Vince McMahon's ""sports entertainment"".

- Man I really miss Carolyn.

- Adam LeClair is funny when drunk.

- Did I mention Carolyn was coming home for six weeks for X-Mas break?

- MTE has the best facial expressions in New England wrestling. Bar none.

Well thats all I got for now. Night."

Last night I had one of those great conversations w/ Carolyn, where we did what we used to do and talk online until all hours of the night just getting to know eachother better, something I enjoyed tremendously. Lord knows after that convo I needed to take a shower ;)

I saw Cousin Violent Chad tonight after I got my haircut. He asked what happened to The Wrestling Shop, & then told me he was enlisting in The Marines and would leave January 3rd. All I can say is WOW. All I can do is wish him luck, but I think he will do okay as long as he has his trusty violent drop toe hold.

"event","Well my weekend has passed, and I am torn as to whether I can thank god it's over thanks to the hassles of wrestling, or wishing it was still here so I could let my worries go away for awhile.

NCW was this weekend, and besides the fact that the show started an hour and a half late thanks to the ring truck breaking down I think the show went well, probably one of the most solid shows we've had yet. I was happy with all the different varied workers on the show and everyone did there job to a tee, infact I think this is the first show I remember that my original bookings actually happened with no last minute changes.. Super!

Work sucks, but at least I had the chance to watch the latetst Odd Couple series in person, ""The Heresy & Kid Krazy Show"". Although they no longer have the supporting cast of Don Juan DeSanto or Mike Dutch they at least have there fighting and bickering down to a tee.

I just want to curl up in bed and not get up, but I have a test for school at six, so I need to be ready.

Have fun kids..."

I had to get up bright and early today to get my State ID for School, which sucked bad since I had to wait in the DMV for ever and ever and ever. On the bright side I can buy porn and ciggarettes without being laughed out of the store now. Whoo hoo!

Payback is this Saturday, and I am not as worried about that as I am about trying to entertain Bay Path High School tomorrow night for an entire wrestling show, but I have my bag of tricks up my sleeve, thanks to my loyal army of Prostitutes. Err anyway, Payback should be fun, as we have most of the EWA crew coming down as well as some solid matches. 

After reading MTE's journal, I have to say that Transformers: RID is defintiely NOT on par with the original series, but thanks to Dark Convoy (not Scourge) The Decepticons have re-energized this series, and hopefully will continue to improve.

After a blah kinda couple of days and with all this national tragedy still on the minds of everyone I am feeling a little better today thanks to someone listening to my problems. I think things may be on the upswing for me soon enough, once I kick my butt into gear.


I went to the movies last night w/ The Portuguese Sensation, Lisbon's greatest son, The Heartbreaker Ruy Batello, or who I just like to call John. We got something to eat first and then went to see The Glass House, which sound cut out in the middle (and most important) part of the movie.

We talked aboot our ongoing soap opera, and what might be ahead for ""The John & John Show"" (by the way my John is first.) All I know is that the drama continues, and when I feel like indulging you all with more information, I will."

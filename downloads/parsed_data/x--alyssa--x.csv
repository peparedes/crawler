"event","<font color=hotpink>so i haven't really written in forever, but i haven't had a computer. i'm getting through school in Arizona trying to get it over with already. This summer Kui and i are going to find a place to live together because we are sick of being apart. Its been over 4 months now of officially going out. i love every minute of it. he completes me in every way. he has become my life, my everything. without him i don't even know where i would be. I'm working at a pizza place thatg just sucks the people that i work with are rediculous and i'm past fed up with them. i have to stick it out for one more month then i can go be with the love of my life. i'm saving up for a car cause i don't fucking have one yet. it's coming though. i'll have one by summer. damnnn straight. school bores me as always and mom keeps constant contact with my counselor cause i like to ditch sometimes. she likes to make consequences like ""kui can't come up if you miss another day of school"" that's one thing i won't give up. no more ditching for mee. i've decided that i'm going all blonde this summer and im gonna start dying it today. if i don't like it i'll change it up. Kui comes to visit me this weekend. can't wait to see him. were on a every other weekend basis right now. oh yeha he bought me the pink rasor phone and added me to his phone plan. it was a big surprise sending it in the mail and not telling me. i screamed when i saw it ha. i absolutly lovelovelove it. he's the best. homework time :/ ha bye kids. </font color>"

thats not to the <b>few</b> that have been great friends.
i fight with my mother constantly to make her feel not needed when i need her the most. 
i lied to my boyfriend about something soo rediculous when hes the one there for me the most. 
i don't even like going out without him. i've been around him so much that i don't sleep good without him there. 
i hate my bed and my house. it makes me angry walking into in. 
i have to find someone to stay with for the week of finals because my parents are going out of town then people are moving into our house. looking for people that are still there for me was hard.

but again people are mad at me for something i didn't do. i have to find a place to stay when my mom leaves for the two weeks that i have to finish school but uh yeah i don't know. im not gonna stay with kui cause i've just been here for a full week already. 
last night i took my family out to dinner for a christmas present, went to fukudas. it was fun i only was able to pay for half though cause my step dad went crazy with the sushi and stuff. 
 
i wish people would trust me a little more and when it comes down to things like when i need my friends that they are there for me not against me. 

i understand that i do retarded things sometimes. 
but i can't change it unless i <b>know</b> about it.
i hate when people assume and don't ask me about things.

i love my boyfriend so much and i love how he's always there for me.

and morning. 
woke up and went to get icecream with steve and chenn. 
got a little bit too much info out of chenn. 
she told me tooo much stuff i didn't want to hear.
then went to nays and smoked some hookah.
then went to kui's then home. 
sat there for a little bit and people started showing up.
had a  party. 
it was fun.
except the part where 5 girls walked in on me getting dressed to tell me about some bitch. 
so kicked that girl out 
people were gone by 2
then me and kui cleaned up a little bit 
he took out the trash then went back inside.
then we came back out like 15 mins later and my garage and car was full of spray paint. 
i went up to the car and touched it and it was wet. 
there were hearts all over the windows of the car and it said ""dick"" on the back.
then the garage said ""fuck a dog"" and ""hate you"" with a heart. 
what the fuck. 
these bitches must have been hella immature.
got a phone call this morning about 10 
my mom asking if i was home and said there was vandalism all over the house. 
she came and picked me up from kuis. 
mom talked to me pretty nicely. 
then got to the house and jerry opens the door screaming you fuckin liar, you fucking bitch, you had a party and your fucking friends did this. This is all your fault. he was all in my face calling me a bitch and saying i'm gonna pay for it and fix it whatever. held a fist like he was gonna swing on me. i was screaming to get the fuck away form me and not to touch me. so he shoves meway into the corner of my seat. so my mom goes ""jerry don't touch her"" very calm. he does the same thing and i turn around to my mom and ask you're not gonna do anything about him almost hitting me?? what the fuck. and she says well this is your fault. thats when i shoved jerry out of the car door and said fuck this and started walking down the street...in the rain. and jerry yells fuck you. then i say no fuck you. 
i call kui way down the street telling him im coming over then i decided to walk  back to get my backpack so i can shower n stuff. jerrys still out front and sees me and bitches some more. i told him to shut up grabbed my bag and walked off again. my mom screamed come back were gonna work this out as a family and i telled back this isn't a fucking family, fuck you. then she chased me down the street pushing and pulling me back to the house. was spinning trying to keep my bag and phone. then jerry comes and grabs one arm moms got the rest of me and jerry rippped my phone out of my hand. mom took my bag. couldn't breathe so i just kept walking down the street. oh yeah saras brother was out in his street watching the whole thing. but then i showed up at kui's door crying. he hugged me for a while then we went a laid down n cuddled. then we made breakfast, french toast n stuff. it was pretty good. then fell alseep in his arms. i love being with him. he makes everything better. 
oh yeah i have a boyfriend :]]
ha he asked me out last night. 
it wasn't all special or anything, but i liked it. 
he doesn't need roses to win my heart.
i don't know when i'm supposed to go home. 
i really just want to shower and leave again."

i can only name 9 people that i know for a fact won't fuck me over. 
and thats kinda sad when you count how many people are in our group. and i guess most of them talk shit about me or just don't like me. Why would you hang out with people that you dont like? i don't understand. and why would you act all nice like you like the person if you don't, that's a waste of time and breath. seriously. i appreciate the people that tell me how they feel, when they feel it. that's what makes me be a  better person and helps me change things for the better. 
i do wish that people would leave me alone though. im really fed up with their opinions about me when my decisions don't even affect them. why care about something so much that doesn't cause any problems for you. just trying to let out your anger i guess, or cause problems? well i don't care what you think. mind your own business. 
AND i did not fuck over josh in any way. this time our relationship was perfect. then he decided that a 14 year old girl was better than me and cheated on me. true story. 
kui makes me happy. im not whoring around. we can talk about anything. and he helps me through a lot. i can call him for any situation. im just soo comfortable with him, it's great.  there is no point in starting a relationship though cause im moving.

"event","so yesterday was sooo fun.
everyone was hyper and jumping around. 
it was great. 
we were all in the same mood. 
UNTILL we went to the next house to party at. 
i hate drama. 
then it pretty much killed it.
buuut we solved it by getting drunk 
and then we all made out. 
ha. 
it was great. 
first time being drunk since the accident. 
and it turned out well."

"event","theres a guy that likes me way too much and asked me like 4 times if i would ever date him and i know im not leading him on because ive talked to him about it a lot on why it wouldn't work. i like him being my cuddle buddie but when hes drunk its so obsessive and it really drives me nuts. i can't tell him that enough. he doesn't get it though cause everytime i tell him hes fucking drunk. im moving in less than a month and i know for a fact that i would go back to josh in a heartbeat. so i've completely stayed away from getting involved with guys. i have to learn to be independant before i can trust another guy again. its really hard after how sudden it was. i thought nothing would come between josh and i, and no matter how bad he fucked me over im deff not over him. which is gay. im trying, but im sure itll take a while. he wants me to erase the last year of my life that i've had with him and pretend it didn't mean anything. it still feels like it isnt real, i wish he would just trust that it would work when i leave. errr. anyway, party tonight. 

i thought about getting drunk last night. 
opened a beer took 2 sips and left it somewhere. 
im too scared to drink. 
i ended up cleaning JTs casa. 
then went to tabs and didnt goto sleep till 6. 
woke up at 9. good stuff. 
haven't taken a nap yet. 
prolly wont. 

maybe i need a hook up buddie.
ha. or maybe i just want one.
one that won't get attached. 
yeah i doubt that'll happen."

and in the end it was blamed on me.
gayy. 
but then again im going back tonight. 
staying completely away from drama though.

oh yeah girls were checking  me out last night
and invited me over to their little sleep over.
it was interesting.

i dont like the fact the shit is getting blamed on me but oh well im not gonna explain myself to people. waste of time. sooo just think what you want.
hookay.

other than that it was fun hanging around kyle. he was running away form me and fell cause his knee gave out. it was gayy. so we cuddled. 

food was good today though. got really full then took a nap. watched like  movies also. family time was good.

"event","mmkay,
hmm last couple weeks. 
fought with parents 
left to cali for a weekend. 
took lots of pictures that aren't worth it. 
even though it was the time of my life. 
great fun.
came home got in hella trouble.

last weekend.
went camping
wayy too cold.
then went to apex that saturday
got soo drunk i blacked out then passed out. 
got in a car accident with kui.
woke up in the hospital.
found out josh cheated on me that night.
broke up with him saturday.
moms happy im alive.
jerry bitches that im here.
didnt go to school all week.
went to joshs house friday.
hooked up told his new girl and 
josh denies everything.
whattta bitch.
people are taking care of that:]]
he freaked out that im moving and decided 
to get his feelings off me by cheating on me. 
that way i wouldn't take him back. 
smart i guess?

it really hurt me though.
we had big plans.
like marriage and whatnot.
everything was perfect. 
and theres not a day i dont think about it.

he calls me a liar like its his truth. 
i tried giving proof i  dont know how that will go though.
i gave a picture and told them to check his body.
he told her the hickey was a bruise from wrestling with matt. 
i done trying to help her out. 
i just wish he would learn his lesson.
and him getting a girl to put up with his bullshit isnt learning anything. 
the sex wasnt even fucking good. which just sucks. its not the same feeling. 

but then again we would sit there and he would hold my hand and i loved that. 
thats what made me happy. he made me happy. i hate that i care so much. that i was so attached to him. just for him to fuck me over and tell me that its my fault and that that little 14 year old was better than me. 

i cant even listen to country music without crying. its sad. es everywhere. my room is covered and my computer. 
i hate it. 

i feel so alone.
he was my best freind. 
now he wants nothing to do with me. 

sometimes i think about ways to get him back but i could never be that fucked up cause  i still love him soo much.

gayy."

when we fight i cry.

i wish it could be like that all the time.
there are too many problems to conquer though :/
//~~//
then the home life 
they ask why im so stressed outt. 
and why my stomach has so many problems.
i felt it today.
me and him got in a big arguement 
because i said i wanted to decorate the house we go to. 
cause ive never had that before. 
he told me to get out before i irritated him. 
and refused to tell me why.
he never tells me why hes mad at me. 
i think he makes it up. 
but when i walked out of the room my stomach went in pain again. 
i hate those moments.
they are so sudden.
i need to go back to the doctor. 

i dont understand why he hates me so much.
i really didnt do anything. 
and when i try to talk to him about it he gets pissed off.
they should divorce."

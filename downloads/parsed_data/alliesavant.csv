""Deck the halls with boughs of holly, lalalalalalala!"" Allie sang cheerfully as she walked down the vineyard that was covered with white snow. It was Christmas Eve, and she and Alya had been invited to stay over at the Turners' mansion for the holiday. Alya was hesitant, but she actually relented in the end, much to Allie's relief. 

<i>I am going to screw on OWLS, lalalalala,</i> she sang in her mind, laughing slightly. She didn't really think she was going to fail on her OWLs, but she was becoming rather worried about answering the exam. questions."

"event","Dear Diary, 

Right now, I am trying not to make so much noise. Faris is sleeping next to me. He looks so adorable. I wish I had a little brother like him. I've just finished telling him half of the Headless Horseman story. I don't like ghost stories very much... In fact, I'm kind of scared of ghosts. Who wouldn't be scared of ghosts? They're frightening, and have red ugly eyes and they're very smelly. Eew. 

Uncle told me off today. I don't even know why. Oh well, at least he didn't seem very angry. He wants me to do house chores tomorrow. Can you believe it? This is <i>so</i> annoying. But he told me it's all a part of training. Yeah, right... I bet he just wants me to slave around for the rest of the summer holidays. 

I feel like a hypocrite. Just now I was thinking how silly it was to have a boyfriend. Of course, I <i>still</i> it's silly, but I remembered that I had Spencer and that I actually <i>enjoyed</i> having him around... But then I remembered that I cheated on him and he got mad at me, and the whole thing ended just like that. Hmm, if that's how things are, then I doubt I would want a boyfriend again. 

It's too bothersome. 

And icky. 

I know I told Cal I like him a lot, and I do, but now I just think that the only thing we can be are friends. And it's not like he actually <i>asked</i> me to be his girlfriend. Now that I think about it again, I kind of feel silly for cheating on Spencer. And I kind of feel silly for visiting Calix. Now that I think about it, I'm not even sure what my feelings are. 

Hmm, someday, somehow maybe I'll meet a boy who'll make me the happiest girl in the whole wide world! Yeah, I'd like that a lot. 

Must go to sleep now. I have to make breakfast for Uncle tomorrow! 

Allie"

"event","<i>OOC: I finally worked out the bug!</i> 

Yes, you heard me right. Or <i>read</i> me right. It's summer! Summer hols! Educationless time for more than a month! Am I excited? Of course, silly. Well, I've just reached home and everything is pretty normal. It's funny that my parents <i>still</i> doesn't know that I visited Calix in Australia a couple of months ago. That reminds me, I need to write an owl to him soon. 

Eep, I still have yet to tell you what Alya did. Somehow, she found out that I had gone to Australia. I am pretty sure Juliette told her. *is annoyed* Why can't I have a friend that doesn't spill any of my secrets? It's <i>so</i> annoying. Then again, purebloods are evil. Well, most purebloods. Anyway, Alya practically screeched at me for running off to Australia without even telling her. 

Oh well. Elsie has gone home to London. Her brother's sick and she's going to take care of him in a while. Poor Elsie. I hope she doesn't have to do <i>too</i> much work. Dad and Alya are going to send me to Uncle Luis's house in forty five minutes. I can't believe this, we just got home and I have to go to Uncle's house <i>already</i>? Alya looks annoyed too. Yep, she's downstairs right now, telling Dad that there is no reason why she should come along. 

Sisters. 

I can't wait to practise eskrima again. But I doubt I'm good at it. Janity's a lot better than me. I suck. Hmph. [>.<] I finally got to read my martial arts book today to do some short research. Guess what? It turns out that the Paralysis technique is actually from tai-jutsu. I didn't even know that. It also says here that tai jutsu practicioners do research on the human body. 

I'll show you a snippet of it: 

""...One reason that their style of fighting (Tai-jutsu) was so effective, was that they not only studied punching and kicking, but they studied the human body as well. Learning all about the weaknesses and strengths. For example, punching a man in the face can be painful, but it might just piss him off, whereas a punch to the throat will be much more devastating."" 

Isn't it fun? I hope Uncle teaches me tai-jutsu soon. But it seems that all he wants to each now is eskrima. =.= Which I am terribly terrible at. 

Speaking of fighting subjects... I actually got punched a couple of weeks before the summer holidays. That Misty Rayne punched me. I actually thought she was my friend! It's so annoying. I didn't even do anything to annoy her and she just <i>had</i> to punch me. Fortunately it wasn't a bad punch and the bruise disappeared after two days. >.< I had to hide from Alya for two days. Do you know how hard that is? 

I don't like fighting with other people unless I feel like it. Why do people want to pick fights with me? It's very, very odd. 

Gah, I have to go now. Mum's telling me to pack up my clothes."

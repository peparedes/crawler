i still probably failed the goddamn final. i love how all my finals
today had review sheets but the things i was tested on WAS NOT on the
sheet! so im pretty much fucked for all my grades. <br>
which means, that since there is a high probability i wont get a 3.5,
that my mother will take away my phone. i TRY to tell her that my
classes this year are hard, my teachers are dumbasses, oh wait so am i,
so it makes no sense to shoot for an impossible goal. <br>
my stupid parents just dont understand. <br>
so anyways, that was my current rant about pretty much nothing. im
going to go frickin play my guitar really really loud to piss off my mom<br>
wear pajamas during finals! other people are dressing up so me shell gina made it pajama week! be cool and do it fools. <br>

<br>
it seems that today is just one of those days where you know you will
always remember it, but you want it to just be erased from memory.
started out bad, ended bad, and now it just got all the worse. no one
will care oh the sorrows of a broken soul, so i wont say them all. in
choir, me andi and elise had a mother rant about how family sux, except
for elise because her mom is amazing. that made me pissed. fucking
FAILED the math test. nice on becca. my mom said something kind to me
today which was scary in itself. <br>
setting: i wasnt feeling well so i didnt eat dinner, bringing the
number of calories i ate today up to around 500 (damn you rockstar!)
and i was just sittign there thinking about, well, life and how i hate
it so. <br>
mom: are you feeling ok?<br>
me: fine, why<br>
mom: well you look sad. im sorry.<br>
<br>
aaahhh creepy stalin mother being kind!! its the apocolyps! i then ran
for the basement, my safe haven. earlier today i went for a walk in the
rain and let the tears fall. rain, tears, all looks the same. no one
gave me a second glance, all though there was a drunk man who started
walking towards me, but stopped after i started to run...<br>
<br>
and now, in the later hours of the evening when good little children
are in bed, my heart recieves a shattering blow, one i cannot
comprehend completely. i have been having chest pains all day, probably
my poor heart surrendering, but the feeling has spread through my body.
i would not be able to sleep tonight if i was given a tranquilizer. i
just am asking for support through another rough patch in this hell
called my life<br>

GOD THIS IS THE MOST FUCKED UP POS EVER. EVERRRRR!!!<br>
sooo my brother has turned into a total hick from corvaaaaaaaalis.
great. grand. WONDERFUL. there went my only ally against my bitchy
little mother. so now what? i dont know<br>
my fucking computer is so fucking retarded that i had to download some stupid programs to read my homework of the internet.<br>
why, what homework, one might ask?<br>
WELL MY SASSY LITTLE BITCH OF A MATH TEACHER HAS US DOING OUR STUPID
HOMEWORK ON THE INTERNET! GREEEAAATT. good thing the software worked!
haha i wish. <br>
ok so for everyone who has finished algebra 2 or above: 270 degrees is
the same thing as -90 degrees, right? good ol' unit circle. except for
on this goddamn website, they arent. so i put 270 and i got it WRONG.
WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG. bringing my hw grade down hmm....9% on ONE
PROBLEM. i used to have a 100% in homework, and now, so far i have a 83
motherfuckinggoddamnmrdunnimgoingtokillyou %.<br>
that was the ONLY reason i had a 91 and now im going to jump off a
bridge because that A inmath was the only thing keeping me from having
no self esteem and my mother actually was able to look at me without
cringing. <br>
<br>
AND NOW ALL I CAN DO IS SCREEEEAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!<br>
god and if that wasnt enough: i stayed up until 1230 doing my goddamn
OMAM essay which has reached the all time POS award. i took a shower at
1 in the goddamn morning, and fell asleep around 2. waking up at 630
was NOT fun. grand to no end. <br>
<br>
AND THEN <br>
journalism was a bitch because maddie noble wrote an article that was
longer than my OMAM essay by FAR like a page, two articles in fact. and
i had the ""pleasure"" of reading and correcting. and then all the other
articles were pieces of shit. and i had to correct them<br>
and design a page and all this other stressful shit to find the GD printer wasnt working.<br>
and choir was ok<br>
pretty much so far i have been working my ass off to get my hw done, i
dont sleep sinec i am having a really hard time falling asleep lately,
i have been getting constant stress headaches (""stress."" no comment) my
mom has been being extra bitchy if its possible, my dad is like a four
year old kid who is hella fuckin annoying and will not stop
interrogating me on the stupidest shit and really tests my temper<br>
<br>
then i realized that i have no talent in the world. kinda sad i guess,
but what did i expect. i made a list of all the things wrong with me in
my emo journal, and it definately takes up more than a page. go me i
guess. <br>
<br>
shiver shiver i think im getting sick. shit dude. me sick= mother
flipping= matthew has higher chance of getting sick= me in trouble and
guilty= dangerous to his health = me hating republicans for not
supporting stem cell research which could possibly end his disease
making risk of illness not a big deal.<br>
<br>
<br>
sooo pretty much fuck the world right now<br>
im out homies<br>

and for giving us that HUGE project over the break that i missed an
hour and ten minutes of bio because my printer was malfuntioning

i was floating, and i had my computer and my iPod was hooked up to it<br>
&nbsp;it was dark
and i was in some type of lake/ swamp area? <br>
it was fucking scary to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">no end
</span><br>
i dont think i had a floatation device? oh wait i did and it was like a plastic ring. how comforting<br>
i was lost, any my computer (which was miraculously small?) was sinking. i pulled on my ipod and it came back up, thank god<br>
so it was safe<br>
but then, how do i get back to shore? its like riiiiight there, but as
i start swimming, a strong current comes, and i turn and drift away<br>
note to readers, im deathly afaid of deep water, and if its clear then
its even creepier. past around 7 feet and it scares me. drownding is
scary. whats in the water? i dont know<br>
but i couldn<font size=""3"">t get to shore so i started swimming. (where
did my computer go?) but i couldnt get there. i was trying and
breathing hard and i was starting to</font><font size=""3""> go under and i wasnt going to make it!<br>
then i woke up and i was on the floor crying and breathing hard<br>
what does it all mean?<br>
<br>
the other day i had two dreams- in one my dog was really sick again
like she was a little bit ago and in the other my mom got food
poisoning again, like she did about a month ago. creepy part? my dog
just got really really sick again. thank god my mom is ok, tho she did
say that she heard me during the night, falling of the bed. it scared
the dog<br>
<br>
im afraid to go to sleep, just like a little kid<br>

&nbsp;sooooo life would be good right now if i actually thought about it
<br>
except for the fact that i got a b in bio, journalism, and french <br>
and the fact that my dad is blind and deaf and gets pissed when he does something stupid and people point it out to him<br>
and the fact that even tho mr moore recommended me for JSA i cant do it because i dont have any room in my schedule<br>
and the fact that i cant stop eating candy<br>
and 
the fact that i am getting really out of shape and overweight and am too lazy to do anything about it<br>
but...tomorrow is a wednesday, meaning today is a tuesday, which means two things.<br>
one) real world is on tonight<br>
two) harry potter is coming out in NINE AND A HALF days<br>
<br>
woot<br>
so i need ideas of what to dress up as. i was going to go as moaning
myrtle, but thats really like main characterish and i bet a bunch of
people will dress up like her<br>
i was thinking that i could be either like a mermaid, a unicorn, and if i lose a lot of weight then i could be a broomstick<br>
i need ideas! its coming in less than two weeks and i need time to work
on my costume! aaaahhhhhh im so excited you have no idea.<br>

god i came home today and grabbed my fleecy sleeping bag and totally
passed out on the floor in my living room until about 630. the whole
time i would wake up and find myself being molested by my dog and my
mom laughing. well at least my dog is cuter than all the rapists out
there. sorry guys!<br>"

<br>
im so....angry right now
<br>
for the past two weeks i have actually been genuinely happy, not ""happy"" like ive been acting for the past couple of months<br>
but then it was like today it all came back, crashing down on me harder than ever<br>
i thought that maybe my mind was finally over the past and that i was
going to be ok, but its like one minute i was having fun and the next i
wanted to go home and die.<br>
my parents are bitches, my grades are dropping, my friends are getting sick of me, im just so tired of pulling this load<br>
again.<br>
i was so happy because i hadnt cried for two straight weeks and i was
sooooooo proud of myself like you have no idea, and i didnt think about
******* ** ****** (god like it isnt obvious), or killing myself, or
anything. it was soo nice to be the normal happy kid i always wanted to
be viewed as.<br>
but that record is over, and i dont know when i will be able to start counting<br>
it feels like these tears will keep on falling<br>
maybe they will tonight, but i know come tomorrow all people will get a view of that same happy kid they think i am<br>
god i was so happy to be rid of my emotions that i almost threw away my emo journal<br>
well good thing i kept it<br>
<br>
i wish i was good at something, anything, just something that will give
me some sort of self esteem that i could sink into and not worry about
the petty issues im dealing with<br>
<br>
oh jesus its starting again and i dont know if i will ever recover<br>
i had another wrist slitting dream again<br>
<br>
to top it all off stevie has a hernia and has to have surgery<br>

i had to hide from him
<br>
he was coming, fast<br>
i dont know who he was or why i was running, but<br>
i had to hide
<br>
i was running as fast as i could and it wasnt fast enough, he was coming faster
<br>
i could feel him coming<br>
i met up with a guy and a girl but&nbsp; i dont remember who they were either<br>
lets call the guy steve and the girl sarah (random names) <br>
we teamed up to get away from him<br>
he was in a car<br>
suddenly we were too<br>
it was night, pitch black as i recall<br>
we were now in a car<br>
our car wasnt going fast enough down this hill, we had to go faster!<br>
steve said he knew how to make it go faster so we could get away<br>
he pulled out an exacto- knife<br>
the blade ripped into his wrist, two quick flashes<br>
the blood poured out onto the road<br>
the blood made the car go faster<br>
we were safe for the moment, the blood carried us far enough away that we could come up with a plan.<br>
we stopped moving<br>
we could feel him coming! something had to be done<br>
sarah grabbed the knife and attempted to help<br>
her cuts were weak and did nothing<br>
i grabbed the knife, and plunged the blade into my wrist<br>
mine was better than steves<br>
we went far<br>
i didnt feel the pain at all<br>
we traveled far away, where did the car go?<br>
we were in a field <br>
there was corn on the outside but the inside was dead, the corn became dense twigs<br>
we ran far and fast into the field<br>
we burrowed down as far was we could, mine and steves wrists still dripping<br>
he was coming<br>
we tried to be silent, but we knew he would find us<br>
he was almost there<br>
so close<br>
then....<br>
i woke up<br>
will i be haunted forever?<br>

well today was a much better day than yesterday. i had a math test on
friday and i got it back today and i got a 90%, which means i have a
91% in the class. its the first time ive had an a in math since like
7th grade. <br>
ok sorry but it made me so happy i was like peeing my pants and i actually smiled like for real. mmmm <br>
anyways back to what i was saying

i<br>
<br>
&nbsp;have lost my emo journal.
i dont know where it is <br>
so all my emoness is spilling into lj and its not good<br>
thats ok no one reads this anyways so i can say whatever i want to and no one would know i said it. <br>
muahahaha<br>
<br>
anyways yesterday was one of the worst days in my life. two people i
thought i was really close to made me feel like i had no one in the
world. <br>
the only thing that made me feel better yesterday was greek techno and sitting in my basement sobbing and eating. <br>
nerds ropes are like the best things ever<br>
<br>
ok before i sign off for the night, there are a couple of subjects i would like to address:<br>
so i recently found out that people think im an attention seeking lying bitch, and i have to wonder about that<br>
yeah im a bitch sometimes but i really am starting to avoid talking to too many people so ?<br>
i really do not like attention so i dont know where that comes from<br>
oh and im a compulsive liar so give me a break once in a while its not
like i mean to but seriously i dont lie that often. at least not to
friends or people around me.<br>
that was like the most harmful thing someone has ever told me or meant to tell me or whatever<br>
ok im done typing an entry to no one<br>

<br>

<br>
my grades probably totally dropped<br>

i saw rachel like less than 2 hours ago<br>
and....add sleepless nights mixed with stress and depression and you have my week<br>
idk <br>
i have nothing really to talk about. im just updating because i feel
bored and im trying to make myself stay up really late so that i will
oversleep and ""forget"" to wake up for church.<br>
tonight i found blackmail material for will gellar<br>
and me and rachel and katie and shelley had an assload of fun tonight and it made me happy<br>
hmmm....definately not looking forward to next week...or next month...or next year for that matter<br>
grrr what is there to get excited about?<br>
omg but i raided stephens computer (since he brought it home??) and
found some more tight songs but he had the harry potter audio
recordings for the first five books on it. the fifth one was like 26
hours long. its craaaazy.<br>
well im bored and i have nothing to talk about thats worth mentioning, so ttyl<br>

falling, constantly falling, unable to get up

there are no tears left, they have all been shed

in the past ... since i updated, lots of things have happened:
<br>
my dog got injected about 5 times with medicine
<br>
she had internal fleas and her fur was falling out
<br>
she lost a lot of weight and was really weak
<br>
i got sick (a cold, not fleas)
<br>
i got injured, and i missed three xc meets and lots of practice. <br>
yay for biking next to kyle teach...
<br>
my brother texted all his friends back here and hasnt called me or imed me or emailed me or made contact with me in any form<br>
i got in a huge huge fight with my parents (again)<br>
i made a new best friend aka nick meyers (sp?) but hes like my new favorite person besides sarah marks.<br>
aaahh nick is like the sweetest kid ever<br>
i cleaned my room for the first time in like...a month<br>
temptation was at an all time high (i hate it. whenever someone says
temptation it sounds like sexual temptation, but obviously thats not my
case)<br>
i am really pissed at more people than usual, which is not a good thing<br>
i have an A in precalc surprisingly, but a C in english<br>
i ate like a pound of food at katies house and then we sat there and pretty much inhaled fat<br>
i got really lonely because stevie left and hes never online when i am and he is getting rid of his lj<br>
i have decided that this year is already sucking<br>

i just found this really tight greek techno....yes thats right...its
greek. its sooo awesome! woot
anyways umm...yeah im soo mad that school is starting since i have like
the worst schedule ever. uuuugh. and also im not looking forward to xc
as much as i thought i would. i mean yeah katie and julia are doing it
which makes me really happy but ... i dont know its like there is
something thats different... maybe its the fact that stevie isnt there
or all the seniors. like alison said, i miss mackenzie, and all the
seniors. oh well boohooing over it wont change the fact that they are
off to bigger and better things.
<br>
or maybe its the fact that one of my best friends that i thought
wouldnt ever think of running with other people because she begged me
not to is now too good to run with me, and even if she isnt she thinks
it. it makes me really sad that someone who i used to be able to beat/
keep up with is now very fast and most likely on varsity. :(<br>
i find that if you are listening to really awesome techno you can do
anything. it like, pumps you up and you are like ""yes, i can do this""
like yesterday i went for a run and i was going to go until i needed to
stop, but i had a really bad sideache. thats ok i still managed to run
for 85 minutes around my neighborhood after stopping to catch my breath
only twice. i feel so in shape even tho im still fat and slow haha. oh
well. <br>
i want to learn to speak greek so that i can sing along with this song
since it is really good. i remember last year when we were listening to
this and mackenzie taught us how to greek dance. this song is making me
sad and now i have to go running so i will catch up with everyone
either tomorrow or on wednesday :( ugh. anyways ttyl<br>

ok so i dont really feel like updating but im really bored and its
either this or i go on a family bikeride. can you say disaster and
social status murder?
<br>
so. my summer. pretty uneventful. yeah i got my guitar like i said. woo
like i know how to play it. thats ok it makes my room look cool...er
haha anyways umm last saturday was the best day of my life when i saw
&amp;hearts; jon &amp;hearts; , tim, and switchfoot live in concert.
seriously me alyssa and julia were like 15.1562156 feet away except
when some fat losers (this one girl looked like gracie hampton....it
was weird) was like omg so she said what? omg and what did he say? and
we were like when are you jumping off a cliff? but nothing was going to
ruin seeing these hott babes in concert. they are coming back in
october and i want to go. anyone who wants to go just call me up and we
shall party. that day was also awesome because i saw ryan sheckler
&amp;hearts; and dave mirra who surprisingly got 10th. and bucky lasek
on vert (who had this group of girls going ""we love you bucky
aaaaaahhhhh"" until alyssa and julia made a sign that said shut up) and
ryan nyquist and bob burnquist. its really cool to see people from your
video games in person. <br>
<br>
and that sums up pretty much the best day of my life.<br>
<br>
oooooooooon monday xc started. that was ok. there were some people that
i really didnt want to be there and i was pissed that they are doing
xc, but the beauty of it is that i can run away from them muahahaha.
there were also some people that were acting....odd. not to mention
names. some people still are acting odd. oh well. <br>
<br>
sw got the stomach flu on sunday night and so he was up all night. i
have this thing with..you know. i dont like poeple being....sick. ugh.
so after taking a nap from 9 to 11, i was awoken by a loud noise that
made me feel bad. so i moved upstairs, but then my mom got sick too, so
pretty much from 2 to 530 am i was sitting in my basement staring at
the wall and pretending that the dark really isnt that bad. at 530 i
went with my dad and brother to the airport because matthew and sw were
going to go to santa barbara &amp;hearts; , majorly jealous (since i
must say their friends that they are staying with are extremely on the
attractive side) and so i wanted to get out of the house. poor sw didnt
go :(:( so sad. then on monday afternoon <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I</span>
got sick, so my whole house was sick except for my poor dad who was the
nurse. ugh. monday was the worst. on tuesday when i had the chills, a
high fever, and could not stand up without staggering, my mom made me
go to regestration! omg. i bet my pic will be aweful, but then again it
always is. was feeling ok on wednesday, and i even went to play
practice and saw Lauren Bruss who is like my hero. it was good. then me
and katie went out for ice cream which was, i must say, a mistake.
thats ok. watching so you think you can dance made me feel much better<br>
<br>
thursday i went to practice. bad bad bad idea. enough said. friday woke
up with acid reflux and bad heart burn. didnt go to watermelon run day.
i was sad. im still feeling kinda eh today. katie is like my hero. and
she is in pal something lake. i am sad. shes not coming back until
monday sometime late. i am sad. anyways im getting sick of typing so im
going to go on a bikeride...by myself. if you want to chill then call
me. im finally feeling up to doing something. <br>
</lj-cut><br>
<br>
attention alyssa spiering: according to my brother even tho you have
like a deck on those cards you can still get only two songs since your

speaking of heros i have a new one, and he goes by the name of andy popp. he told fetus-head off. hahaha i love that kid. what a punk.

ummm.......yeah. next year when stevie leaves i will probably sob my eyes out. i will have no one to help me through. 45 minutes away is so much different than having him right there.   ):  major tears. i will be sitting on my bed bawling about how effed up my life is and he will come and just sit there without words, and somehow everything is better. 

i learned that when they say life isnt fair, they arent saying that just for kicks. they arent kidding. life, at least mine, really isnt fair. commonly asked question, ""why me?"" hmmmmmmmmmmm

god i wish i had no emotions. i also wish that i had a different life. if wishes were fishs there would be no room left in the sea for water. i should really stop wishing and start being realistic. easier said than done.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""major venting- dont read if you are easily offended"">
<br>
posting on my parents- well at least on my mom.

<br>
<br>
i hate being the youngest. yeah there are benifits, like favoritism
(which i only got because i am the only girl) and your siblings have
already done things like high school and whatnot so you know how things
work. i think that SUCKS. if you are the oldest, you are so lucky.
<br>
<br>
being the youngest means that my brothers have already set out lives
for themselves, tried everything new, done things that my parents
approved of, and have succeeded in making them proud. like ron weasley
said, if i dont do something right, then im a bad person and my mom
gets pissed, but if i do something good, it doenst matter because my
brothers have already done it, so whats the point? there is none<br>
<br>
i am forced to follow in the footsteps of my brothers, something that i
for one am so sick of. everything ive done in high school and even
before that my brothers have done. like xc. i despise running, and see
no fun in it. but hey, why does my opinion matter? matthew and stephen
did xc, so i have to also. my parents dont care about the fact that i
would rather be doing almost anything than running, but then again when
have they listened to me? pretty much neve, unless i scream it out loud.<br>
<br>
matthew was a drama kid. he was in windjammers, musical theatre, one
acts, school plays and so on. because of him stephen was interested in
musical theatre, which means that i am forced to take it. i am so glad
that i changed it to ceramics at the last second or else i would have
screamed. i have no interest in being in drama, which has nothing to do
with stephen. many poeple have told me that i should, but i do not want
to . just you watch tho, by senior year i will have taken musical
theatre.<br>
<br>
both stephen and matthew were in choir, A Capella, and i guess are good
at singing. i dont think i have that good of a voice, and ms serra
should be put in an asylum, so why do i want to continue with choir? i
dont. my mom said that it looks really good on a college transcript.
well thats funny, matthew didnt even think about choir till he was a
junior, and i dont think stephen did either. yet i am pushed to the
side and forced to endure ms serra and a bunch of idiots rather than do
someting i really enjoy, like guitar<br>
<br>
speaking of guitar, i didnt get mine today. i probably wont even get
one. my mom and i got in a fight about how i&nbsp; wanted to drop choir
and take guitar instead, which led to the fact that im a failure at
life, which led to the fact that if the guitar would make me happy then
we'd better not go and get it. my dad thinks i should focus on sports,
which is ridic since im not good at any sports, so why kill myself
training? why not at least attempt to have some fun this summer? my dad
thinks that i have to be doing a sport year round since my brothers
did, and he did as a kid too. but im not him, im not my brothers, i.
am. me.<br>
<br>
my mom is still pissed at the fact that i got a 3.2 this year. my
brothers were on the honor roll, so obviously i have to be too. well im
not, boo hoo, no point in worrying about it.i think matthew was only in
it for 2 years anyways. but it doesnt matter what he did. my parents
only dwell on my failures. which according to them is pretty much my
life. i cant talk about my grades to anyone. my parents just get all
mad and dont care who i had for a teacher, what happened that made me
get a b, or anything. they just look at the numbers, or in this case
the letters. most of my friends are the type of people that are not
satisfyed with a 3.8. they have a's in just about everything, and tho i
know they are too kind to say anything, probably think that i am a
loser because i got a C in adv. algebra, when almost everyone got an A
or a high B. bring up grades in my household and my dad gets an angry
look on his face and my mom storms around the house ordering people to
clean their rooms.<br>
<br>
i think my mom needs to go into counseling. she vacuums the house
every. single. day. its like the most ridiculous thing ever. according
to her, we have a dog which means that there is an excess of dog hair
which cannot possilbly soil our house for longer than neccesary.i have
caught her vacuuming the dog, which she says she does because its
funny, but i know better&nbsp; she cleans the bathroom everyday. she
scrubs the floors everyday. she makes me clean my room everyday. due to
the fact that i am a messy person, i am constantly not allowed to do
things owing to the fact that i usually am to lazy to clean my room/ i
dont want to. freaking phsyco.<br>
<br>
this would all be fine with me if this was all. after all, they ARE
parents which means that they are supposed to be a little nutty, but
this, this is over the edge. why, you might ask? because of two words:
Rolling Hills. to me, its like the death sentence. i did not think that
there was a place that caused me more stress than rolling hills, which
is absolutly ridiculous since its a church. i could write a novel on
why this is the worst place ever, but i have decided that the only
people who are reading this- which i wouldnt be surprised if it was no
one - would probably be bored into a coma, so i have decided on spark
notes. first of all, rolling hills is like the lake oswego of churchs.
the new church that they are builing is going to be like the size of a
hotel- about twice the size of our high school. the adult center alone
will be able to hold 2500 people, complete with internet cafe, fountain
the size of my house, and a starbucks. a STARBUCKS! these freaking
people cannot go for what, 1.5 hours without a starbucks? these people
are the most aggravating people i have ever met besides g W, but i
havent met him and i dont want to or else i would jump off a cliff.
these people think the world of themselves. they think that because
they are christian they are entitles to do whatever they want to do,
and justify it in the name of the lord, so its ok. they are all rich
stuck up snobby republics who worship george bush. like seriosuly
worship. at the chirstmas service about a year ago, the main pastor
(since we have like 200, no joke) was like and i quote, ""god bless
george w. bush for being an amazing president"" and when the election
was coming up, they put reminders to register to vote under every
chair, and if you voted for anyone but g W, well you might as well be
packing your bags and gettnig ready to go to hell. they are the reason
i hate christianity- they think that its their world out there, and
they can do whatever they want as long as everyone else is really
impressed. last time i checked a church was for worshipping god, not
yoursleves. i would rather become jewish and go to a synogauge than be
forced to go to rolling hills. it is people like that that make me feel
so angry. <br>
<br>
amd of course. my mom wouldnt miss a sermon for the world. i wouldnt be
surprised if she voted for old bushy this election just to be able to
brag to her friends about how she is so godly and bla bla bla. im going
to be blunt. i hate george w. bush. i hate him as a president, as a
person, whatever. i hate him. i think he deserves to go to hell for all
the crap hes making people like diabetics and homosexuals go through.
and we cant forget the catastrophe aka the ""war"". bush lied, 1800 AND
COUNTING have died. i dont know how anyone can openly say ""yes, i
support this jackass, i think hes doing the right thing, and i support
him 100%"" sorry if you do, but i do not understand. and this is pretty
much rolling hills, and this is why i hate it. G.O.D. IS NOT G.O.P.!!!<br>
<br>
another thing- my mom wants me to be this little brainwashed goody too
shoes. which i am so not. i yell. i scream. im loud. im obnoxious. i
have extremely low self esteem. i despise the president. i have never
had a problem saying whats on my mind. i do not respect peoples
feelings, no matter how hard i try. i do not care about impressing
others. i speak before i think. i am lazy. i am not a neat freak. i am
in no way or ever will be a republican.&nbsp; i do not believe on
forcing people to believe what i believe, tho i like to debate and
express my feelings. i do not believe on forcing to live by my beliefs
on other people (liek how some straight people want to ban gay
marraige. you are straight, it obviously doenst affect you, so why do
you want to ban it? i hate how people say its gross. even if it is, get
over it) unless it would benifit the world (stem cell research, which
by no means is immoral. there are embryos that are sitting in a freezer
somewhere doing nothing but be cold and bush is making them into kids.
umm.. if people cant have their own kids then look to adoption and
orphanages. they are almost overflowing with unwanted kids) and i do
not like someone, no matter how nice they are, if they have or do
something wrong, aka my neighbor and her mooching bf who is like the
worst person in teh world. he beats rusty, sometimes brags to me about
it. i often say they are jerks, retards, fatasses, dipsticks, idiots
and so on when they can hear me, but i dont care, he beats rusty and i
will not forgive him for a) bragging about it and b) still doing it.
then again, i never did care if someone or anyone hears me.my mom finds
this a common source of irritation. she thinks that if they think this
is the best family ever, then it doesnt matter what they do. she doesnt
care if someone else does something bad like one of my ex-bffs who i
know mistreats her dog, but hey, they respect my mom so its ok, right?
no. the answer is and always will be no. <br>
<br>
i also hate how the parents expect me to believe what they believe. i
didnt want to be christian, i am now because they are forcing me, and
right now i am not on the path of close knit christianity. they do not
and never will believe in gay marraige. my brother stood up against him
and got yelled at. i feel teh same as him. i think that bush has not
done one good thing while hes in office, and im sure my parents think
that hes doing ok, at least my mom. everything that i am she is not,
and everything she is i am not. there is little that we have in common,
so we do not get along. common cause of stress. i hate how she didnt
even take classes like french (which i am taking only because my
brothers both took spanish, so i thought maybe i could get away with
doing something they didny, though im still expected to get high a's)
or adv. algebra and so she has no idea how hard they are. especially
math, and she expects me to get high a's. just like all my other
friends. news flash to her, but i am not my friends. i am not my
brothers (I thought she would have at least noticed the fact that i do
not have a penis, but wonders will never cease) i am not her. i want to
do something on my own. hence why i am so interested in guitar. yeah
matthew has one but he never bothers to play it. maybe just maybe if i
do something on my own they will let me do other things on my own too,
but this dream has shattered. i hate how i will always be the family
failure because i do not try, i do not bend my will to do things that i
do not want to do, and i do not listen to every little b.s. lie that
they tell me<br>
<br>
sorry for the freaking essay. i was so mad today when my mom said i
couldnt get my guitar (which is so stupid since im the one paying for
it) and then it turned to grades then i went and sat in my room after
they bashed all my friends (dont worry my friends, i yelled long and
hard at them for the cracks they made about you. i couldnt stand it.
friends are more important than guitars anyways) i sat in my room and
cried for about an hour and then i sat in bed and pretended to sleep
whenever they came in to check on me. yeah they still check on me
because they dont trust me. what am i going to do, break my window and
make a run for it? im not THAT stupid. when they checked on me i
pretended to be asleep so they wouldnt ask why i was crying or why i
was a failure or bla bla bla. i think my mom got mad that she succeeded
in making me cry again so she told my dad that maybe just maybe on
friday we could get it in hopes of making me not cry anymore, but not
making me happy when she says no. <br>
<br>
yeah i didnt think anyone would read the whole thing so whatever im out
of time and emotions and im mentally and physically drained. never have
i been so tempted to do anything in my life. never. (rest easy, not
suicide). the only thing that im looking forward to is friday.<br>
<br>
talk to everyone latar <br>

playlists on my iPod (oh yeha i got an iPod mini for my bday. its bleu)
and so i plugged it in and bla bla bla then the computer froze like
four times in a row and i had to restart it twice. now it says that
i&nbsp; cant disconnect but then the computer says that it isnt plugged
into it. so idk what to do. and neither of my brothers are coming home
for a while. thats three.<br>
<br>
then to top it all off im really sore and my leg is throbbing and david
is gone for two weeks and no one is online and katie is working during
the day so i cant call her and AHHHHHHHHHHH im going insane like
seriously i do not know what is wrong with me. i cannot sleep at night
anymore. i will fall asleep then awake during the night anywhwere from
3 to 7 times a night, and have really weird dreams.&nbsp; thats if i
even fall asleep. usually i just sit there with my eyes closed waiting
for sleep to come. and then im really grumpy and piss everyone off.
then i get in trouble and cant do anything. woooo<br>
<br>
top it off with all my old issues that are still bugging me and im one effed up mess.<br>
<br>
on a happier note ma pere et moi avons alle Portland Music sur samedi
and looked at guitars. tomorrow we are going back and getting my
guitar!!! finally!!! even tho i have to pay for it i dont care at the
moment. today he was like ""i dont think you should waste that much
money"" and i was like then why did we go out there, get assistance,
tell the guy we were coming back?? so i am.. the package:<br>
guitar bag<br>
picks<br>
sheets with cords for beginners<br>
whammy bar<br>
strap<br>
tuner<br>
and of course, the guitar<br>
alyssa if you are reading this i need to ask you some things since i
know you have a guitar!!! omg excited to no end. in a little bit when
it says music i can say me!! haha ok i know im lame<br>
<br>
on another happy note. my parents arent making me go to jesuit after
all. they said that because of the increase in gas prices they dont
want to drive me all the way out there but i think its because they
were afraid of me being angry and the fact that i can take them down.<br>
<br>
well now idk about the guitar thing. my dad thinks that instead of
""focusing on music i should be more interested in sports"" god, its like
if i say one little thing about doing something besides sports my dad
freaks out and brings up sports in which i usually end up angry and he
ends up irritated and in a bad mood. so i really hope i do!!!! ahh ok
sorry for the essay. i havent done a post like this in awhile. <br>
<br>
:( i just dont know what to do with myself. <br>

a<br>
n awesome day

<br>

but track camp is OVER :(:(:( i never thought i could ever<br>
&nbsp;a)be a camp counselor or <br>
b) ever get really close to kids that are younger than me. <br>
to tell everything that was amazing would take too long, so highlights:
<br>
Boo. shes like the cutest little kid i have ever seen
<br>
Devin. period
<br>
ryan hitting himself in the balls with a turbojav
<br>
the trio of anna alexa and boo
<br>
rachel getting fourth after saying she couldnt run
<br>
cole devin and mckenzie

omg the list could go on forever

a rave and its so fun. check davids lj for like the funniest song ever.

<br>
<br>
<lj-cut text=""emo crap no one needs to read. "">
so i went to lake grove today. reason isnt neccesary. i sat on the
swingset for an hour and fifteen minutes, crying. waiting. hoping.<br>
<br>
this lady that was riding her bike with her three kids rode by. she was like wtf? still there was hope<br>
<br>
this guy with a metal detector came. idk what types of interesting
treasure there would be at an elementary school, but whatever. he was
like wtf? then he went away. still a glimmer of hope<br>
<br>
moved from the swingset to the play structure. better view. literally
praying and pleading. hope started to fade, but was not gone. <br>
<br>
finally at 830 i gave up hope. it was gone, shattered. what did i
expect? i deserved it. got on my bike and headed home. tears blinding
where i was going. almost ran into a car. honking,. there was a picnic
at waluga. everyone was like wtf? <br>
<br>
was really sad at that point. riding down invererie, i just wanted to
get home. started pedaling really really fast. flip flop slipped. butt
fell from seat, straddling, still going really fast. spiked pedal
ripped through my leg and toe scraped against pavement. almost face
planted. slammed on brakes. fell off bike onto the street, sitting,
shaking, sobbing, bleeding<br>
<br>
this old couple walked by. i smiled at the guy. hopeing he would help
me up, ask me if i was ok, comfort me. he shook his head once and he
and his wife kept walking.&nbsp; that made me cry even harder. got
home. called katie. sobbed into the phone. once again katie comforted
me. <br>
<br>
mom came home and so did dad. mom told me to soak my foot and leg in
the bathtub and let the blood come off which was staining the carpet in
the basement. i filled the tub with an inch of water that was clear.
when i was done the water was pink, almost red. leg burned and is
really swollen. tomorrow at camp i am expected to run in the 100 meter
relay. great.<br>
<br>
i do not know if i can stand anymore pain, whether its physical or emotional, i just cant take it. <br>
<br>
i do not deserve sympathy, i just wanted to type out what happened so people know why i seem kind of distant<br>
<br>
happy birthday and congrats on the permit to the amazing katie sun.<br>

but i hope everyone is having a better summer than me. pretty much all ive done is summer school (which is finally over. i went into the final with a 91% and the final is worth 50% of my grade. i hope i got an A!), watch dawsons creek (omg katie holmes!), kinda went running for a while, and read harry potter....again. i know i need a life

if in the future someone is talking to me either online or in person whatever, if im in a bad mood then im sorry in advance

anyways tomorrow i start working for liders track camp. im teaching 9-12 year olds how to throw things, and i bet they will all be whiny and suck. at least i get paid, and i get to sleep in until 8 now!!

well i have to get some shleeeeeep so i will tt everyone later!"

<font style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"" size=""2""><font size=""3"">well, seeing that i havent updated in a while, i guess i will now
<br>
so far summer has been pretty....well pretty dull. my mom and brother
left, and it was pretty sweet. i would wake up at 630 and go to school
yeah that still sucked, but then i would come home, eat breakfast in
teh basement, sleep, play solitaire, and sit here wondering why people
didnt update their livejournals.<br>
&nbsp;but it was pretty cool i guess. my mom wasnt here to cook so i
think my cholesterol doubled after eating fast food 10 days in a row
for dinner...ugh.
<br>
but i have come up with a new years resolution! yes i know new year was
7 months ago, but it took me a while. so by july first of next year i
am going to be a vegetarian except for chicken when neccessary, because
chickens are ugly. but this will be hard for me to give up things like
pepperoni, but how was i supposed to know it was pork?!?! thats just
disgusting
<br>
so that is my goal, only dont tell my family that because my previous
attempts have been unsuccessful due to parental intervention.<br>
&nbsp;but one super cool thing was that me shelley david and julia had
an LOTR marathon. yeah it was pretty intense. i was at shelleys house
from 10 till 11. 13 straight hours. then after the movies were over we
were out jumping on the trampoline and some idiot threw over a
smokebomb only we didnt know that was what it was and it was underneath
the trampoline and was like all spark-y and it scared us all
soooooooooo bad. it was terrible. <br>
so pretty much this summer, i have done nothing. wooooooooooo. <br>
this is sad. i liked being in school more than i like being out for
reasons i would rather not talk about. but all i can say is that if you
want to have a happy fun filled summer then make sure your mother gets
more than 5&nbsp; hours of sleep a night and doesnt have to do hard
labor. i found that out the hard way.&nbsp;
my mom came home on thursday and woke up at like 9 on friday and was
like clean clean clean clean and it was so ridiculous. she woke up
earlt just to clean. so that was what i did all say friday--cleaning.
what a great way to spend it too<br>
my life is so ridiculous. i come here and whine and moan woe is me blah
blah blah. but i just cant help feeling a little down lately, and i
dont really know why. i know this is like the biggest cliche ever, but
it is really true: my life lately has been a roller coaster--up and
down up and down, but it seems now that people notice. goody. so now
there are people that are worried about me. i love them and everything,
but like if i have certain things i need to think about them let me
think about them <br>
this is the thing that really bugs me--im so ungrateful. here are these
caring poeple that i love to death trying to help me from being a
retard and all i can say is back off. yes, maybe they are coming on a
little hard, but at least this time people care<br>
it seems that lately i spend less time laughing and more time thinking<br>
thinking is all i do, and it is really dull<br>
and i read harry potter<br>
my record for reading all the books: 7 days. think i can beat it? im going for it <br>
this s</font></font><font style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-weight: bold;"" size=""3"">hows how i truly have no life<br>
except me and katie did pilates a while ago. and it toned my butt. haha yeah right it is still gross.<br>
oh well i think i will go write in my emo journal, i dont want people getting mad at me when i let out all of my problems<br>
maybe i will see poeple late</font><font style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"" size=""3"">r<br>
sorry if i sounded whiny, but according to my mom that is all i do. <br>
and im off to sort out my issues on my own<br>
ps. talk to me if you arent doing anything on the fourth. im going to
someones house and it is always really awkward and boring if i dont
bring a friend so please talk to me!!.</font></lj-cut>"

<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">reading back on
my last entry, i am quite dissapointed. for yesterday i thought i had
finally gotten over being depressed, but today i start again, and it
has to do with my neighbors. whats new. im sorry to bore you guys with
all my stupid whining, but i really need to let all this anger and
frustration out.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">so as you all know i hate my neighbors. so. very. much. well, heres why

</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">so today i went
over to get the keys to my house, reason not important, but yes we have
a key at my neighbors house. well i went to go pet rusty, and i noticed
that something wasnt right, but what? then i noticed that he wasnt
holding his tail up all the way. in fact, it was tucked very very
tightly around his butt. oh, ok no big deal. well, i was petting him
and telling him he was a good boy, and then i was like there is
seriously something wrong with his tail. so i picked it up to see what
was wrong
</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">all of a sudden i heard teh most pitiful wimper i have ever heard. <font size=""4"">it made me cry</font>.
i sat with rusty and david and cried like a little kid. this is the
saddest part. so anything could have happened to his tail, right? well,
rusty tried to sit down and he couldnt. he could not sit down. at all.
he was in too much pain. do you know why? teh (insert several naughty
words) neighbor that lives too close to me kicked him. i know, because
he said he was going to punish rusty. connect the dots? yeah i knew it
wouldnt take long to do some serious damage
</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">this was the
saddest thing ever. i sat and cried and petted rusty (the poor boy. he
was cringing when fatty got home which is the most disgusting thing
ever) and talked about everything he ever did, going back to when i got
him and how i trained him and how he was a really good boy and how he
is being corrupted by some (insert naughty words) cow and the
unmentionable creature that is too evil to be a human being.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;i do not
understand. this dog is one of the sweetest most well behaved dogs i
have ever known. yeah he might disobey once in a while, but so does
every other living creature, and after all he is a dog. that give <font size=""5"">NO ONE</font>
the right to harm a dog ever. i do not care what he did. chew up the
sofa? well did you let the dog know that he wasnt supposed to? dogs
cannot read minds. dog pee in your house? well he wasnt trained yet,
and kids would too if we didnt tie absorbant crap around their asses.
so why is a dog so different than a human?
</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">you dont see
human kids being abused, and if they are then you not only can tell but
a much bigger deal is made out of it. why is a dog so different? think
about it, they are a lot like little kids that you take care of. you
feed them, house them, wash them (clothes or body etc.) teach them
about life, tell them what to do and not do, and love them. but it
seems that my (naughty word) neighbors skipped that part, and went
straight to the disciplining. this is not the first, and i know it is
not the last, but there is nothing i can do. nothing.
</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">i thought i was
going to be sick. have you ever seen rusty? he not only is gorgeous,
with rich orange fur, but he has the sweetest face and is one of the
friendliest and well behaved dogs ever. i do not understand ever ever
even thinking about hitting him or harming him or any other animal
ever. <font size=""4"">EVER</font>. there is no excuse.

<br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">but i need some
advice. i really dont know what to do. i have already tried to tell the
animal control people, but there is no evidence of abuse if you have no
proof, and a 14 year old eye witness will do nothing. i am so sick of
sitting there and let an animal who did nothing to this man be beaten
to a pulp, cringe at the sight of him, be afraid to bark, play, and be
a dog. this life was supposed to be better than the one he had before,
but it seems that rusty has stepped into a living hell</span>.

"event","<lj-cut text=""welcome to my life"">
ok, i have decided to go downstairs and try this cut thing again so i
dont take up all of your friends space with my mindless chattering
yes, this is going to be a loooooooooonng entry, so for all of you who
get bored easily like me, you dont have to read this. in fact, dont
bother. dont even comment. this is going to be like the most pointless
entry ever. and in advance, sorry for the whining, the offenses, and
the stupidity of this novel
so. my summer. well, right now it kind of sucks. you see, i just got my
report card, and well, it wasnt good. and my mom just HAS to have me
get like a 3.8 or above or else im screwed. and guess who didnt even
get on teh honor roll?? yeah thats right, me. and i hate how most of my
friends are like omg you suck (well not literally, but they are all
like super smart and whatnot) and everyone else is like boo hoo. so
this is why my summer sucks. next year in the first semester if ""i dont
bring my grades up then i am going to be transfered to another school""
yeah thats right, either westside or jesuit, my parents havent decided.
but for now i am working my little ass (more like overly large but
thats okay) in summer school at jesuit, and all i can say is that if i
do have to get moved, it better not be jesuit
three reasons i do not want to go there:
<br>
1) they cannot have gum. not at break, outside, or anywhere. NO GUM!
yeah ok
<br>
2) the school most def is about 15-20 minutes away. which means getting
up at 630 to get to school on time
<br>
3) the most ridiculous one: NO FLIP FLOPS! how would i survive? that is
so stupid. why not?? well, according to ""the code of conduct"" it would
make too much noise in the hall ways. wow not like you have to hear
anything anyways
but what am i doing at jesuit? well in order to get good grades next
year, i am focusing on my worst subject: math. last year i had the
worst teacher ever named mr. woebke, a total idiot who hated me because
i was late a lot and he unfairly gave me detention and didnt teach one
of the hardest classes in the whole school. so i got a c. good job on
my part. i always do stupid things like that.
so im taking pre-calc to get ready for one of the most difficult
classes, and i can tell you this class will definetly either help a lot
or not at all and for those of you who are acually reading this, i
will not bore you with descriptions or anything like that. but all i
can say is it sucks. majorly
so my spirits are pretty low today, and i am so looking forward to this
week
<br>
and now i move on to my mother, a subject i could write a book on.
so this is why i am often not allowed to do anything: my mother. if i
dont clean my room every single day, then i cannot do anything until it
is done. and yeah thats not bad, right? well it is if i have to like
scrub everything and i can tell you it is never ever perfect. and she
will be all pissd at me and then when she wants something done shes
like ""oh honey will you do this for me?"" and acts all sweet, especially
around other poeple. it is ridiculous, and this is the sad part. she is
leaving for 8 days and already i am saying party. this is sad when i
actually am looking forward to my mother not being here. sad sad sad
<br>
and if you are still reading this, do not comment on how i am whining,
i already know i am a whiny little brat, and i dont need it rubbed into
my face. do not even comment
<br>
and this is where i really dont want people to read because i know this
will raise poeples anger levels and make them angry, because i am
talking about politics. yes, the dreaded thing that no one dares bring
up anymore for fear of offending poeple. this is why i have like no
friends- i cannot help but saying what i feel, i just cant help it, and
im sure if you had a brother or a close family member who could die
becasue of one man and his stupidity, im sure you couldnt help it
either. i know i know i still should ""consider other peoples fellings""
but the truth is i cant and i wont even try to becasue it will be a
waste so if i say something, and it offends you, then i truly am sorry.
but this is the thing that pisses me off
the most--its like i can really fit into a group anymore. i mean, i
know this will be hard to believe but i used to totally relate to the
republican party way more when i was one of the ""good girls"" or
whatever. but like i said i have totally changed how i think and feel
this year. i used to be pro measure 36, but after seeing both sides i
saved my opinion and changed it. i used to be totally into this whole
thing about even if it doesnt affect me i will still have an opinion,
like on abortion, gay marraige, and marijuana. i have changed them all,
and too bad for anyone who doesnt like how i think. but this is what
pisses me off the most:<br>
&nbsp;you can be republican without being christian
<br>
you can be christian without being republican
<br>
why cant people just get that through their minds? this is why i cannot
relate to any group--democrats think i am stupid for being a christian,
and republicans think i am evil becasue i support things ""against the
bible"" and i am ""a raging liberal"" good god people just stop, do not
judge, do not assume, and please dont use things like ""but you are
christian"" or ""i thought you were a democrat"" against me.
im not like naming names or like pointing fingers, but please i do not
think i can handle it anymore. politics is one of my passions, as with
debating and my new found interest in stem cell research. i love to
talk, put people down, and things like that and i just cant help what i
like to do. for example, if i say i hate george w. bush, it is probably
because i want someone to debate with, and i never intentionally hurt
peoples feelings, even if it doesnt seem like it. and i am very
patriotic, i just hate teh people in power. so do a lot of people. get
over it.
<br>
but im done with that, i am continuing with my novel, because i havent
updated in like a week&nbsp;
<br>
so yesterday was elise elshires surprise bday party at the famous
denney's. what a blast taht was. so we went there and chilled for a
while until she came, and it was basically the drama kids and alyssa
all chilling and me david jeff josh and adam sitting on the side being
freshman (yes freshman) loners. oh well. it was hott when kelle licked
teh frosting off of elises face. tres chaud haha.
and then we all went to the dip. well at least most of us did as john
duffy kinda.....didnt come..?
but yeah it was really intense, especially in a minivan haha. it was
actually really cool when we went like 60 or however fast we were
going. but yeah it was pretty intense, and happy bday to elise elshire.
oh yeah, and surprise!
<br>
<br>
well this was actually written yesterday but i didnt have time to fix
it and whatnot so i have deleted it and started over and now i am
writing about things that happened today also
so as most of you know i hate my neighbors, and many question why.
well, when i went over and let chloe and rusty play, he was being a
little too rough so i grabbed his collar and made him sit and i said
bad dog, but he was cringing and shaking so much he could barely sit,
and he didnt ever look me in the eye. do you know what this means??
abuse. that is why i hate. i have ho tolerance for things like this,
and i hate it when poeple assume they are above animals and therefore
have the right to abuse them, kill them, use them, or train them to do
whatever they want. god created people and gave them the responsibility
to LOOK AFTER and TAKE CARE of the world and ALL its inhabitants. well
looks like that one is down the drain. oh well, right? too bad 99.9% of
AALLLL plant and animal species are extinct today mainly because of
people. i found that in my elementary school math book, the one that
has the facts to show you how whatever you are learning will help you
later on in life, or to keep you interested. and i know that i complain
about my neighbors a lot, but again i cant help it.
<br>
ok, now for the wierd stuff that has been happening lately. so like i
keep having these really weird dreams, and then something out of that
dream will come true, like something little like i had a dream a month
ago that julia (or someone who looked just like her) was wearing a pair
of my sweatpants and tehn she shows me that they have a hole in them. i
had this dream about a month or so ago. and on the last day of school
julia comes and she is wearing a pair of my sweatpants since she had no
dry clothing, and she shows me the whole in the same place that i saw
them in. weird, yet it has been happening a lot lately and it is
getting kind of creepy. oh yeah, im such a psycic. but like seriously i
have been having so much deja vu lately and it is really weird
<br>
but today my mom left for shasta and she isnt coming back until
thursday. and matthew went back to linfield to ""finish a paper"" aka
have a party. so it is just me and my dad. and i can tell you it is
very lonely. half of the time my dad is out either doing work stuff or
taking the dog out so it is basically me. me me me me me. weird, yet
fun. my dad doesnt care if i do like anything, as long as i ""try my
hardest"" aka school and ""im in by my curfew"" aka midnight. sweet. im
thinking party.
but it is also kind of bad to be lonely. yeah i can pick up the phone
and call someone but idk its like i just want to be left alone or
whatever. my life basically consists of school, sleeping not a lot,
eating not a lot, sitting and making hecka long lj entries, going on
the internet and seeing that no one is on, or watching tv and petting
my dog. what a fantastic summer. oh yeah and i have to work but im
making like 300$ in like 3 days. its so cool. but i really wish that i
had like a really big house so that all my friends could come over and
play animal noises, which is like the greatest thing ever. it makes me
feel like i am 6 when i had to do that at my second cousins bday party
where i was the only one over two feet tall. that was strange, but
right now i am basically thinking. i do that a lot these days,
thinking. i actually believe that i think too much, but oh well. and
then i realized that everything going on in my life is somehow
connected, and if i want to fix it then i have to find the root of the
problem and kill it. like that will be easy. but i cant help but wonder
sometimes.....
aahh this is a really long entry, but i keep typing because this
keyboard makes a cool noise when you type and makes me feel like i can
type really fast. ok i think this updates people enough, but if needed
i will give an overview for those who dont want to like read every
little detail. 
1) i have summer school at jesuit, which allows no gum or flip flops, gay gay gay
2) my grades sucked and my mom is thinking about transferring me to another school
3) politics suck wehen everyone is against you and you are too strong willed to be around other people
4) elises bday party was cool, and it make my day when she got a douche, which according to alyssa it smelled really good......
5) i hate my neighbors becasue they abuse animals. whats new
6) originally i skipped number 6
7) i am lonely and lazy
8) i have been having a lot of deja vu and whatnot and creepy dreams and it is scaring me
<br>
9) this entry is very long and my keyboard makes cool noises
this is a hecka long entry. if you read this whole thing word for word, then i love you

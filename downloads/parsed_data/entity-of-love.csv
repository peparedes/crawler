"event","Ok so...... Today....... First of all just felt weird, I dont know, I cant explain it. Then my mom calls me, and says she got fired..... WHOA in all my 19 years, that has never happend to either one of my parents. Or to me.... So my first reaction is to freak out and just think my whole life is just gonna turn upside down....... but everything happens for a reason, and I think that some good can come out of this :) 

Im not feelin too deep right now so pardon the shallow feeling =\ 




I did get that job I applied to.... wow me, amazing, really..... and ill be making so much money, thank god cause my mom just got fired....... which i think may be good for our relationship in a way... itll bring us back together :) at least i hope so. 

my   computer is now in my living room, which im looking right at my front door now, kinda creepy, not sure if im feelin it, but gotta arrange things for my mom...... 


i dunno maybe some things in my life werent ready to happen yet..... cause there were a few big things that i wanted/needed to get done or do, and maybe im not ready, or maybe the other person involved isnt ready either, so we'll see what comes of this


but so weird today is.........."

"event","So this weekend has gone well....

You know its so strange how something so horrible, can change feelings in you, remind you of things, bring something back into you that you thought was lost, that warm feeling you have inside of you when you are in love, and sometimes when life gets hard or stressful or busy that warm feeling gets pushed back out of reach untill something happens to make it become blue flames again...... I remember reading about how God prunes us, and how its a very very painful process and we may do things or feel things we dont like, but it must be done in order for us to grow, i think that God does the same thing to relationships, Im not saying He causes bad things to happen, Im saying that when something bad does happen, he turns it into a pruning process, and when its all over, things are clear, cut back, problems have a solution and life is ok. 

""We all trip, we all fall, sometimes we even crash, but what makes that ok is having someone who will grab your hand, pull u back up, nuture u back to health, and hold on tigher for next time, and if  you feel as if you are going to trip, fall, or have a head on collision, they will be right there, ready to catch you, and stop you from self destruction."" - Me

I dont know where that quote came from, somewhere in my head, I think God may have just put those words into my mind, because I read that and go wow, it gives me a warm feeling knowing I have that, and I am that all at the same time. You know, Loves a tricky thing, its not all roses and candles, sometimes its hard, sometimes you have to watch people you love go through agony knowing all you can do is hold their hand, which breaks my heart, but Love.... Love is so rewarding, so fulfilling, so honest, so pure, so incredibly comforting, and I know that I would not live if it was not for the Love I have :) I am so lucky, and no matter what goes on, or what mountain I have to face, I know that Love will give me unconditional strength to go on. 

By experiencing this kind of love, I feel I have a greater understanding of God, for He is love, and how great that would be, to be in His presence once again...... cause what could be more great then being in Love, and experiencing all of what I just described? Having more of it! Knowing that God doesnt care what Ive done, or where Ive been, or why Ive been distant, all he wants is for me to come back to Him, so that He may show me that Love, and Grace, and how great would it be, to share the love He gives, with those you love? Theres no catches to Gods love :) I am just in a state of awe about what I feel right now, and obviously Ive felt so much tonight :) So Im going to pass on what Ive felt, and experienced with those of you reading :)

""Im forgiven, because you were forsaken, Im accepted, you were condemned, Im alive and well your spirit lives with in me, because you died and rose again. Amazing love, how can it be, that you my King should die for me, Amazing love, I know its true, its my joy to honor you. In all I do to honor you. You are my king."""

"event","Hmm ok first of all let me just tell you about my interview! It went sooooooo great! I wasnt suppose to know till monday if I will get called back for a second more in-depth interview but before I left Lisa and I scheduled one for next thursday! I am soooooo excited, the  pay is so great, the daycare is so great, I will really be honored if I get hired, because they only hire the best! I even had a melt down before my interview because last night I had to run out and find an outfit, cause  well Id rather not say, but I found one, expect I grabbed the wrong size jacket, it was too small,  but I didnt realize this till 20 min before I had to leave, I was ready to just give up, but after it was all over, I realized it was just God telling me that things arent always perfect, nor can I be perfect, or make things perfect. Because everything went just as great as it would have if I had a jacket that I could button :p 

Today was really great all around, after my interview I stopped by the mall to exchange my jacket, and stopped at victoria secrets, and they were having a one day only sale, 8(actually 9) body products for 35 dollars.... each product costs either 9 bucks or 9.50... so u go ahead and do the math =D I saved a lot, and got my sister-in-law her christmas present already :) 

Ok so thats all great =D..........

Now for the dark part of my life the past couple of days. Something very serious has been going on in my mind, Im not going into detail, but it effects the rest of my life, and I am so confused, and torn, but a really good friend has been there for me, and shes made me realize that I am overreacting a lot, and that its best I didnt do what I wanted to, I wasnt given the chance. So whats life if you dont take risks :) Pretty boring....... So Hey if things work out the way I want them to, and the way I think God wants them to, I will be gaining so much more in life, not just for myself, but for someone else also. 

Confrontations suuuuuuuck dont they? Cause I mean who really wants to go hey you lied to me, or hey i know u did this, or the one the guys love the most from women... ""honey we need to talk"" :p I know Shane loooooooves that one :)"

"event","Well, the past couple days have had their ups and down within each day, creating a very sickening roller coaster for me. I do not like roller coasters, and will never go on one... Ok so let me talk about the lows fist...

Lows of the past couple days -

- Not feeling well - not that I ever do, but its been more weird then usual
- Confronting my Stepmother - Completely Unpleasant
- Realizing that I need to stop being lazy - not fun, I dont wanna do a couple of things I have to because they really are just too hard, and I can not, so I think that if I dont do it, I cant possibly add another failure to me list. 
- Preparing for sugery - I mean who really wants to go see a shrink... 

Highs of the past couple days -
- About 5 daycare centers have called me back, after telling me they had nothing open
- I have an interview on friday to work in the infant room =D very exciting though I dont think Ill get it but I am sure going to try my hardest 
- Shane and I are at our highest peak in our relationship - And I think that its only going to get higher, we are so in love right now, more so then I ever thought possible. He really is wonderful, we have an extremely strong relationship, and I know its only going to get better :) He is my support and he makes the Lows not so Low :) 
- My credit is perfect - and with that, for once I can afford to buy clothes, and new pots and pans :) which in return makes my credit score even more high, because it shows how much I can handle and pay off : ) which in return makes me eligible for a really great place to live! 

So I guess that means my highs and lows are pretty much equal. But hopefully after Friday... Itll be unbalanced :) I really am content with life, not because of what it is now, but because I know what its going to be in the near future, meaning the next 6 months =) 

I have been thinking about College.... And I am not really sure what I wanna do with my life, Im going to be 19 in a few weeks, and I have no clue, not that it really matters, but Id like to have a career that I enjoy, and so far, its between becoming a Daycare Director, or a Dental Hygienist for a Ped practice =) 

So this is whats inside my head at the moment :) Nothing too exciting... and im not feeling any great emotions to blurt out!

Till next time.....

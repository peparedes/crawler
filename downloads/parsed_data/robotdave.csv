I have a new girlfriend, I'm scared of the future, but I think I'm strong enough
to climb into a beautiful summers end with this person.

It's been a few years since I've even wanted to think about dating someone.
But for some reason, nearing the end of summer, this gorgeous girl appeared. 
I guess I should consider myself lucky. =]

Till next time.

She had a baby though, whom I'm going to name Ewok Jr.
Apparently it takes 4 weeks for a baby bunny to be weaned, so I hope Ewok Jr. makes it! :\
Wish her luck!"

"event","Like myself, your motivation is brilliant. (Although) your objective, (a damp & dreary bog of false statements) shakes my insides (like a rattle snake in a tin can). You make my skin crawl from it's hard, stiff, and bony surface. Rather then resembling a man, you much more remind me of a bug, a dirty, scum infested interpretation of a diseased ridden cockroach, squabbling at the scraps of human existence. It's a pity I will not do as you would wish me to in this compilation of correctional capers. An opinion collected in a wrathful manner from mind numbing, breath taking array's of (big talk), and a cheap display of arts & entertainment.

You are the center of the universe in your own mind, or are you? Are you so afraid of these (tranquil oceans ahead) you spew your own guts out onto this  table of cheap talk, in a choreographed stint of unfortunate foolery. 

To say the least you make me sick, and to be in your presence (feels as if I am dangling at the edge of hells rocky surface, legs curling back into my spine (Ribs crackling in the fire) eyes roasting inside of my skull from the burning flames of fury, and my screams over-lapped by your bout of belittling boasting).


I could murder you with a brush & canvas, or write you into a tale of sorrows with darkened days, and no chance for tomorrow. 
But what Ill do is worse then words, and more terrifying then a lingering sense of eternal suffering.
I wont say who you are, and you will only finish this story of hidden hatred wondering (who you are). It will eat at your scabby surface like maggots through flesh, until you are nothing more then a pile of tattered torn skin, (stinking) with hordes of flies, perched on your scattered skeletal remains. 

Since I'm afraid you are far to self absorbed to understand these bold statements, I shall situate you with a spool of clues. I have sat back for far to long watching you wage your audacity upon the exspendable. People to caught up in this weary world to reconcile a reality of your transparency. You will use them up, and crumble their breaking bones (as the blood gushes from your finger tips). Their hollow (screams for help) will not be heard. Servant's at your feet. I almost hate (them) as much as I hate you. I do say sir, all you are is an entrepreneur of exhausted inhibition. 

That is all for now. Farewell."

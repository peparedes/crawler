"event","I could have sunk into the floor.  I've kept my mouth shut for fear of being thought to be even more immature then I already am, but in truth I doubt I could hold it in any longer.  I want to bash my head in with my wrench I'm so mad at myself.  I've gone over the details of eveyrthing that has happened hundreds of time in my head, and each time it comes down to the fact I was careless.  Utterly and completely void of any thought whatsoever.  It's one of those things that could have been so easily avoided, one of those things you keep wishing you could change and you can't and it drives you off the deep end.   
<P> I spent, literally the last two days attemptin to put the ships mechanic devices back into even semi-decent working order.  And today I was simply trying to reinforce the gravitational device.  The last thing we need is for it to go off-line in mid-space.  We'd be havin people go off into space all over the place.  When I saw Fahna working with the one piece I needed, I didn't think twice.  But that's me, selfish as ever.  I didn't even think about what Fahna might be using it for.  
<P>And contrary to the common belief on this ship, I did not take it as a joke, nor would I ever do something that irresponsible.  I can see the look in the others eyes, especially Heut's.  They all think I'm irresponsible and un-capable of doing my job, which just makes me even more angry.  I'm probably more capable then half the people on this ship, and there's not another sould besides my da that could have had half the mechanics woring like I have them working right now in such short time.  I keep failing to live up to the blasted potential I know I have.  I'm not a <b>CHILD</b> which is exactly what I'm being treated like.  
<P>I do however, I wish Fahna had just let me know.  She'd no need to go running about like she did.  I can't help it, but I part of mind blames her, which is entirely irrational.  All the same, her being a weapons specialist you'd think she'd not be stupid enough to go and trip on the stairs with a blasted bomb in her hands.  Arrg. <P>All the same, they have a right to be mad.  The entire ship.  The disapproval I see in people's eyes is so thick I think I could scream.  I shouldn't have joined this crew, but it's to late to back down now.  Entirely to late.  All the same, I can't help but shudder at the thought of fixing the entire ruined part of the deck, with everyone watching. It'll be like a brand of shame, you'd think I spend ten years trying to move forward in people's eyes and I keep getting shoved back down.  Here I am trying to get the approval of the Captain and the entire crew, and I end up sabatoging my own efforts. <P> I can't handle being called a twittery female ever again.  It was this bad when I worked in port, but even then I at least managed to do things right to some degree.  I swear, I'm starting to sound like Shin, who kept babling on about how it was his fault.  Feeling sorry for oneself is not a virtue, so I'll stop now and endure this punishment hopefully without humiliating myself entirely.  <P> <i>  OOC:   You have no idea how funny that was.  I get to school today and Fahna(or my friend who plays Fahna...) walks up to me and is like oh yeah you weren't on last night... we set off a bomb on the ship.  Talk about a bit of a shock.  Hehe.  ^_^ I would have supported her doing it had I been here anyway.  I'm sad I missed out.  I had four tests to study for though.  Hmmmm... I'll just have to play in the aftermath.  ^_^  Fun fun.  Oh yeah and in case you haven't guessed, my character is mortified.  What people think of her is basically what she builds her life around.  </i>"

"event","I spent the morning working on all the basic equipment that needed work.  Only thing I'd like to know is who the heck the last engineer on this ship was.  The machines were a mess, rusty, missing parts, and broken at that.  I made a few makeshift changes that should last until we get to the next port. <P> Perhaps then I'll ask for the new parts required, but at the moment, the Captains attitude towards me isn't exactly generous.   I can't help mentally chiding myself for my cheeky mouth.  Damn my temper!  I need to learn tact, as my da so often warned me.  It'll end up gettin me in trouble one of these says, and probably with that first mate Heut. <P>  I met the man today, and all I can sya is he is really rather good looking, alot like the covers of those romance books my brother used to read.  Fahna warned me abot him though,  cute, but deals out punishments like no other.  Might as well try to avoid those for as long as I can, a;ready ont he Captain's bad side, because of thast dratted Shin,  It was amazing how easily our crew doesnt seem to get along these days. I personally have no grip with anyone but the cat.  With his blasted arrogant attitude.  I threatened him today, and I think he might have actually taken me seriously finally.  He obviously has secrets, but then again most people do. He seems most concerned that I'll prythem out of him.  Personally I've decided I don't care in the least about his past, but he sure as hell better help me in the future and not put me another situation like he did yesterday.  I;'d sweatr i'm the only one on this ship that's got no shady past I'mtrying to hide.  I'm pretty mucha s apparent as it gets.  What you see is what there is."

"event","I would swear that I'm the only one out of the entire crew that's not nervous about my descision to leave Montressor.  While I can't insult them for being newbies, considering I'm one as well, I can't help feeling insecure knowing I'm going into my first official journey with a bunch of sniveling little twits who could just as likely be ready to jump ship at a moments notice.  I've been taught to make a descion and to stick with it.  Through all the odd's.  Not only that but it seems as though I could very easily be the only one not running away from something.  Other then Fahna that is, while she may not have the best relationship with her parents, I think she's joining the crew for honest reasons.  That she wants something new, a new job, same as me.  At least I can have someone to depend on.  Which is more then I can say to the others.  Everyone seems to have motives or be runaways.  Am I honestly the only one who's simply looking to start a career, not to hide from something?  What's worse is I'm afraid that Captain Flint is going to group me in with them.  While it's true I've never flown on a ship before, I have had years of experience in engineering.  Year of dealing with the proffessional spacers.  Years of seeing how these arrogant spacers interact with each other.  Years of practicing being heard and practicing becoming the proffessional I am today.  I'm good and I know it.  Now I just need Flint to acknowledge it."

"event","Funny.  I think I'm the only one on the Etherium that doesn't have a secret.  I met that Shin-sin-fa today at the local tavern.  While seemingly noble, I could swear he's hiding something, and I'm a good judge of character.  <P>  My prayers were answered, I got to see Fahna before leaving and ironically I'll be seeing her more often then not now.  She's to board the Etherium with us as our weapons specialist.  While I should be thrilled, which I am, at the same time I'm worried.  We haven't been in one anothers company for more then a few days at a time for the last four years.  Now we'll spend each day together.  We'll have to see how this plays itself out."

"event","I went down to visit Clarise tonight.  I wanted to do it before I left.  It was a tearful goodbye, interrupted only by my often cynical comments.  But then again that's me isn't it.  The funny thing is, she told me how the Lorrianna was back in port.  Funny.  Fahna usually doesn't arrive back at this time of year.  I was hoping maybe I'd get to say goodbye to her too once I heard, but I realized there just wouldn't be time.  Perhaps I'll sneak away tommorrow morning to try to see her before we load ship.  At least I'm prepared for that.  I've packed my clothes.  And my tools.  I've said my goodbyes, or most of them.  I'm just about ready to go...  I even ran to look at the ship before I came home.  It's beautiful.  In it's own way.  Anything to get me somewhere new.  Off this one tiny planet.  I'd never let anyone actually know how excited I am, it'd ruin my reputation.  I can just see the jokes that would run around port."

"event","<BR>Funny the way life turns out, eh?  Here I am all excited about my first actual journey on one of those blasted ships I fix so often, and now it's lookin' like I'm going to be going on a ship permanently.  Me Da's not goin' a be happy, but then again he's always the one who said it's important to chart your own path.  So, here I am, the chief engineer on the Etherium RLS, and well... it'll be an experience, that's all I have to say.  
<BR>  Clarise berated me this evening for taking a job so lowly.  She'd like to see me on an official Navy ship, she would.  Easy for her to talk.  Her families got enough money to stave off the hunger in all of montressor.  I can't afford no official trainin.' And... no official document certifying my trainin', no official job.  I'd bet a whole load of solar galleons I could beat those official engineers into the ground.  With both eyes closed I could.  <BR>But no, I'm stuck with the crew I have now.  Not a bad lot.  The Captain looks like he might be a pain, but I'll prove myself like always.  Supposedly he's got a rep as a hard one to work with, but knowin me it won't matter.  Me da's a hard one to work with too and he taught me everythin I know.  Runnin the lengths of those ports at Heather Cove, taught me one thing.  You gotta act tough to get yourself heard.  And one things for sure this Captain Flint ain't goin' a intimidate me."

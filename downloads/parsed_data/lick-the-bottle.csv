Speaking of Caitlin she likes wierd noises with her noses and she is mouse retarded but then again so am i.I am going to watch movies with Caitlin because we are cool like that and we dont watch boys with bo running up and down a court. Caitlin should join band bc she plays a killer nose. I especially like her star wars rendition but she usually sounds kinda snotty. You should look at me closely twitch twitch Caitlin's foot is twitching and she wants Tweety bird to look . Well i am so insulted now i am a twit. so now that this randomness has gone on long enough we have one last news bulletin Caitlin is Abe Lincoln and she cut down the cherry tree if she didnt have problems i would tell her it was Georgie but since she now thinks she is morse code and is beeping we know there is a problem. I cant keep up with her multiple identity syndrome. 
Lets play charades and smile"

"event","So yesterday was pretty fun if you dont count the english test which i bombed lol. After school I went to the freshmen game with Ashleigh, Laura, Ashley, Becky, and Leah. It was lots of fun and I got to meet Ashley's BF Cody and it was fun bc Ashleigh and I tried to convince him my name was Charlotte but some people are too nice ahem! I didnt really watch the JV game bc Ashleigha and I talked to the v-ball players who hahaha have an eleven oclock supposed curfew. Potter came to game then and so did Kristin and Erica. It was fun and I have to say Erica should be a photographer bc u have to see the pics on her camera they are hilarious! Ashleigh and I got in a kinda small food throwing fight w/chris but it was more like guerrila tactics than a fight along with random shoving. Both Varsity and JV won yay! AFter the game I watched the Pistons game & let me just say I love them-they kicked the bulls in the nose ring I mean they annihilated them! 
I am afraid I dont understand the need for everyone to have Holiday parties to go to so you cant hang out with the guests-I shalt not condemn them 
Leah I heart our m-phone I dont know how to spell it"

"event","So last night was fun! Caitlin and I went on like a two and a half hour bike ride. It was awesome except i had to ride the krappy bike and now my but hurts lol Caitlin had to ride it too. Anyway we went to Crystals were her little sister was like attacking us lol! And we would have seen Kristin but of course she wasnt home grr! The lake was the best tho- we went surfing and it was absolutely freezing! Leah, Liz, Caitlin and I went to mass and movie night except i only went to  the movie! Yes i win. We had to help move stuff into this attack that looked like a horse died there and it smelled. We watched the goonies which was highly amusing especially since if u touched Caitlin she flipped. We had pizza but everyone ate it before me-pigs! I went to  BK afterwards so hahaha!"

"event","Homecoming was a blast except the dance was lame. Moohhahah Shores actually won omg when is the earth going to self destruct which would put us in a bad position because we have no alien friends to help us hitchhike a ride on a spaceship. I swear i am sober unlike mitch who u kno we love at least i do. Holy shit don't do that it looks like fireflies hahah that was awesome. Caitlin and i stocked up on moutain dew, pizza, and intergalatic info last night. IT was stellular for lack of a better word. I am sad because i cant remember the stoner joke about the monkey, lizard and crocodile, liz u gotta tell it to me again. Caitlin looked wasted  lying on the floor lol that sounds sufficiently wierd! I dont quite understand the whole swedish kid thing going on last night but it is still cool, his accent did really sound fake! grr u made me feel bad. ON to a darker note I think leah told Caitlin that we have confirmation ugh lol on the 23 of oct which means that i cant go to the orchestra concert bc i cant miss another week of confirmation!  
To end happily i am finally done with this update allelujah hehe
I leave u now but remember always carry a towel so the space monsters don't get u!"

"event","So tomorrow is HOMECOMING! yay i am so excited honestly i am not being sarcastic. I honestly don't understand why the actual homecoming is so exciting i like the week before better. Anyway so i might join the band. I was waiting for a ride after school and this girl asked me if i wanted to join the band. I thought she was joking so i was like sure. I guess they need people to pretend to play and fill in the holes. I might do it if they still need people on monday. It would be a big commitment but then i would get to spend time with my band lovelies ya kno who ya are lol! WE'll c what happens.
I hate bio need to study
I cant wait for the secrets of the future"

"event","So the theme of my forgotten journal is going to change quite quickly here.  I am in need of a place to record my thoughts and my memories.  Not too long ago, Dane and I spent a few hours going over some of my journal entries here.  We laughed and joked and talked about things we had completely forgotten.  It was nice to have those memories written down, because obviously my brain had found a way to push them back into Neverland.  Now more than ever, there is a place in my life I want to remember every single moment.

I met Dane about 15 months ago.  We met through the internet on Match.com.  Yes, I tend not to tell people this all the time, but the truth remains the same.  We started talking in August and decided to meet in September.  Hurricane Rita tried to ruin our plans, but in the end we prevailed.  He ""sheltered"" with my mom, her boyfriend, my sister, and some random guy my mom's boyfriend knew for 2 nights.  We were stuck together for 2 days and 2 nights and we got along perfectly.  We spent time getting to know each other in our pj's because we had no electricity.  We played silly card and trivia games with my family and essentially we started on this journey.

Over the past year, we moved in to our own apartment in December between Christmas and New Year's and continued to fall in love.  Actually by this time we were both pretty sure we had found ""the one.""  Of course, we disagreed and we had to learn to communicate and work through difference of opinion, but at the end of the day we were still happy and secure with the knowledge that what we had was greater than any disagreement.  In September, we decided to start looking for our first house.  On the first afternoon, we found it.  It is perfect.  We put an offer down on Sunday, which was accepted and a mere 40 days later signed on the dotted line.  We had our first home, a beautiful 3 bedroom-2 bathroom house built in 1947, and updated recently.  We moved on November 3rd and spent most of November unpacking and learning the joys and pains of being homeowners.

Fast forward to December 2006.  Friday night, December 1st, we had date night.  We went to Maggiano's and split a bottle of wine and had a wonderful romantic dinner.  It was great, something we should do much more often.  Saturday was spent watching football and decorating for Christmas.  Dane had some work to do for a big proposal due this week and I just enjoyed a lazy, cold Saturday afternoon.  We had a Christmas party to attend Saturday night hosted by some of Dane's college friends.  We both got dressed up in our holiday gear and decided to head our to the party.  

Dane, however, had a few other plans.  As we were standing in the living room talking he mentioned that the plant my mother had given us (daisies, geraniums, chysanthemums) as a house-warming gift was beginning to die.  He picked a small bloom off the floor and said, ""Look at this one, he fell on the floor.""  He then handed me the flower and picked one petal off saying ""She loves me."" I responded with ""Yes, I do.""  He then asked me to finish the childhood saying we are all familiar with.  As I made my way through the petals he just sat there smiling.  As I pulled the last petal I spoke, ""She loves me not.""  I then began to make as many excuses as I could about why this was not true.  I tried to tell him the stem counted as ""She loves me"" or that it was really ""She loves me or She loves me alot.""  He wasn't buying it.

He just sat and smiled and then said, ""I think you need another petal""  which I agreed with.  Before I knew it out of his pocket came a beautiful wooden box, small enough that my brain started to register exactly what was happening.  I started to open the box and he bent on one knee.  Inside was the most beautiful engagement ring  I had ever seen and kneeling before me was the most honest, remarkable, wonderful man I had ever met.  Tied around the band was the last ""She loves me"" petal.  He looked at me with tears in his eyes and spoke the words we all dream of hearing, ""Amy, will you marry me?""  I couldn't talk or move, I  just stood there speechless for a good 30 seconds.  I then grabbed him in a huge hug and laughed and cried all at one time.  It was perfect and of course, I said YES!  

We spent the next few moments in complete bliss, laughing and crying and kissing and putting on my ring and telling each other how much we loved each other.  It was absolutely perfect...I couldn't have imagined it any other way.  Little to say, we didn't make the Christmas party.  We called his parents, who were ecstatic and then we made our way to my mom's house to tell her the good news.

His dad wears his mom's dad's ring (Dane's maternal grandfather's) which he inherited after Gus died.  He asked Dane if he would do him the honor of wearing his ring as his wedding ring.  I have no idea if that made any sense, but basically Dane is going to wear his dad's wedding band.

I spend the rest of the night in complete euphoria.  I honestly don't remember if I truly heard him ""pop"" the question.    When I saw the box and him getting on one knee I lost it.  I saw the rest of my life unfolding in front of me, and I couldn't have been happier. 

We spent Sunday in relative seclusion, calling some close family and friends, but mainly just together.  For him, it is something that for a long time he never believed he would find.  For me, it was something I had always dreamed of finally becoming a reality.  

The word fiance seems a little weird, the words husband and wife seems to flow much more smoothly.  The words bride and groom are still rather foreign in my vocabulary.  Today at work it was exciting to tell the story and show off my ring.  I spend most of the day making sure it hadn't gone anywhere.

We have both agreed that the wedding will sometime next fall probably October or November.  We aren't in any hurry to start planning and right now we are just relishing in the engagement euphoria.  I will scan the websites over the next few weeks but don't plan on doing any serious planning until January.  Right now, I am just extremely happy and yes, in love.  I have truly found my best friend and couldn't be happier knowing that soon I will be his wife."

A million thoughts are running through my mind and each time I try to reach up and grab one my hand blurs the waters and I have to start over again...
None of my thoughts amount to much at the moment, just a mixture of self-doubt, denial, anger, fear, unrest, and failures run through my mind like a freight train entering a long, dark tunnel...the end not quite insight, but there, in the back of my mind..."

"event","Hello LJ world.  Yes, once again it has been too long.  

Thankfully my life has remained good.  I am now residing more with the boy in Houston than with my mom. It always requires a little adjustment, but he is great and has made it pretty easy.  I love going home to him every night, but even better is waking up with him in the morning.  I love just sitting in bed still trying to shake off the sleep and talking.  We have the most random conversations, but I love them and they make me so happy.  They help start off my days even better than I could have ever thought.

Last night I got to see BON JOVI though, and that too was awesome.  He has such a great tush and is still so damn sexy!!!!  The concert was awesome and I sang my heart out to the classics and some of the new ones.  I was probably one of the youngest ones there though which was quite interesting.  The people around us were 50 and 60 year old men and women dressed out in lighted T-shirts and last years leather pants.  Oh how I wish I had a camera phone.  It was a great night, even though it made for a very early morning.

Lastly, I want to express my condolences to Nick and his family on the loss of his cousin.  I don't have any experience personally with addiction or suicide in my family.  Nonetheless, I love Nick and have tried to the best of my ability to educate myself on his disease.  I am greatly sorry for his loss, but extremely thankful for his life."

"event","Well hello there again LJ...it has been too long....no really, it is all my fault...I should have been a better friend...you forgive me, good....I'd hoped you would.

Okay, apologies over.  Yes, I am posting....finally.

Maybe what they say is true, when life is pretty good and things are rolling your way, it is better to stay quiet then tempt the gods to give you something to write about (or in other words bitch about).  By far my life is great, no complaints here.  I have awesome friends, a great family who loves me no matter what, and a fabulous man who wraps me in his arms every night. What else could a girl ask for?  Truly not much.  I am learning slowly but surely to adjust to life...not questioning everything just living.  It is easier but still far away from being normal.

I was rereading some of my earlier posts this evening, and I amazed at how much time changes things.  There were definitely posts that still today bring tears to my eyes, because I can remember that day and that emotion.  The raw hurt of a relationship when you begin to realize that it was never going to work, or the true terror in leaving the place I found myself to travel 1500 miles away and begin again.  There were also the happy posts, the posts where dreams became reality and that little girl began to trust herself.  No wonder keeping a journal is therapeutic.  It allows you the travel back to the best and worst of times, it allows you to remember and value the lessons learned.

I can't believe it is already the middle of January.  As age increases, time does decrease.  5 days from now will be the 1 year anniversary of my grandfather's (I called him Papa) death.  The first death I had experienced as an adult...the first realization that sometimes hurt doesn't go away it just dulls with time.  My grandparents were married just 5 days short of 60 years.  SIXTY YEARS.  I still can't comprehend that number, that dedication, and that love.  They met when she was still a teenager and he was just a few years older.  They courted and dated and then he left for WWII.  They wrote letters back and forth and she prayed he would make it home safe and she loved him the best she could for such a young girl.  He came back and they married and eventually had two children.  They were frugal or better put he was frugal.  A great example is that before they had kids he took the backseat out of their car to use as their living room sofa.  He never finished high school, but worked hard as a master plumber and died not owing a penny to a soul.  He paid for everything in cash...his house, his car, his trips.  If they didn't have the money, then they didn't need whatever it was.

I loved my Papa.  He was such a great man...he loved me.  He was proud of me.  He had the greatest hugs.  Last Christmas was the last time I ever saw him.  I was home from Philadelphia and the entire family came over to our house.  We had dinner and opened presents and talked and took pictures.  Family pictures, pictures that show he lived and that he was loved.  If I had only known I would have spent more time just talking to him and hugging him, but of course no one had a clue.  He wasn't sick or frail, just elderly.  My aunt, uncle, cousins, and grandparents left late that night.  I don't even remember telling him ""Goodbye, or I love you.""  I just remember that all of a sudden he was no longer there.  I flew back to Philly taking for granted that I would see him the next time I came home for a visit.

He went into the hospital on January 10th with what he thought was a heart attack. It wasn't.  It was a gallbladder attack.  He was there for tests and lots of other stuff, and finally had his gallbladder removed.  I talked with him and the rest of my family frequently, but never understood the severity of the situation.  My family is not medically oriented, except for me.  They had hope that all would be okay, and in the end it gave me hope as well.  The day he was supposed to get discharged he got an infection.  It spread fast, and before I knew it he was in the ICU.  The next morning his heart stopped beating...they brought him back.  My sisters called me in Philly and I got the first flight out...it wasn't until Saturday morning.  They shocked him 13 times to get his heart back, he was now on life support.  My sisters saw him and told him goodbye and how much they loved him.  My mom and her brother said goodbye.  They all tell me he was already gone, he died that morning, and only modern technology brought him back.  Later that morning my grandmother was visiting and his heart stopped beating again.  The nurses and doctors ran in and started CPR...my grandmother stopped them and asked them to leave.  She then crawled in bed with him and held him as he died.  She didn't want him to live like this, she didn't want him to suffer.  She held him and kissed his cheek as he slipped out of this world.  My sisters called me about 15 minutes after it happened.  I wasn't there...I didn't get to say goodbye.  It still haunts me to this day.  I know that he knew how much I loved him, but I would have loved to say it just one more time.  I would love one more hug.

I got there the next day, and stayed with my Nana (that is what I call my grandmother) while my mom and sisters went home.  We talked until late in the night on Saturday...about a million different things.  She would periodically cry and then wipe her eyes and go on with whatever she was saying.  We opened a bottle of wine and just talked.  It will forever be one of my favorite memories.  Right before we went to bed, she started crying again.  This time she couldn't stop and I just held her.  Finally, she said she needed to ask me a question.  ""Do you think your Papa is angry that I let him die?""  That was the question.  And my reply was, ""Absolutely not.  I think Papa is so proud of you right now.  You let him go where he could take care of you again.  He is so happy you loved him enough to let him go.""  We were both crying now, and she replied, ""It was my last gift of love to him, to let him go in peace with me by his side.""

So as I sit here and cry while typing this into the computer, I remeber how lucky I am to have been loved by this man.  He would write my Nana poems for every occassion.  She has them for 60+ years, letters from the war, and love poems to showcase their love.  She won't let us see them...she tells me when she is no longer here I can have them and read them and learn a little more about a very special love...until then she likes knowing that she is the only one who truly understands.

We laid my Papa to rest on Tuesday, I think.  I can't truly remember.  I know there are people who read this who don't necessarily believe in God...but the love my grandparents had for each other transcended Heaven and Earth.  My Nana always got white roses from my Papa for special celebrations...anniversaries, birthdays, just because.  She received a huge ivy plant from the lady who came weekly to help them take care of their house.  She placed 12 red silk roses within the ivy.  It was beautiful and my Nana truly treasured the plant.  On the day of their 60th Anniversary she went to  the cemetary to bring him some roses and cry...when she got home all 12 of the red silk roses had opened to full bloom.  I have no explanation for it and neither did she.  To her and to me though it was the sign that she needed to go on living...he was there, he didn't forget, and she still got her roses."

"event","Well, yes, it has been a long time I know. It just seems like I could come up with 1000 reasons why I don't ever have any time to post, but, honestly, the truth is sometimes I am just too damn LAZY.  I come home from work and by the time I really think about posting I would rather curl up in my bed with a good book, read a little, and then off to sleep.  I am going to try and do better, I hope...just be patient, please.

Work is good.  I had 3 cases today and they all went well.  I am finally beginning to feel comfortable in this OR. It takes a while to understand who you can trust and who you can't, as well as, who understands your jokes and others who still haven't completely accepted the fact that women are actually doctors and surgeons, too.  I worked really closely with some vascular surgeons while in residency, and learned a lot from them.  We had a guy from a vascular company come to our office the other day and give us a presentation on their products.  I asked lots of questions, and before I knew it we had discussed some procedures in quite detail.  I guess they liked my interest, because 1 week later they called and asked if I wanted to attend a conference in Las Vegas this weekend.  And, of course, I said YES!!

We (Dane and I) leave on Thursday afternoon and take the redeye back on Saturday night.  He has never been and is soooo excited...its pretty cute.  I have been 2X, but not in the last 5 years.  We are staying at a non-gaming hotel (I didn't know these existed in Vegas), which is good on quite a few levels.  First, the rooms or hotel won't smell like smoke...no old geezers walking around with their oxygen tanks in one hand and their cigs in the other.  Second, it is at the end of the strip right by Mandalay Bay...so a great location.  Third, and most importantly, is the fact that there is no gambling in the hotel.  I haven't been to a casino since the ex-BF and I broke up over 3 years ago.  He had a gambling problem and I got roped in as well.  We gambled all the time and I racked up some pretty substantial debt that I have been paying for over the past 3 years.  I haven't gone into a casino since then.  I figured if I didn't tempt myself then I could fall back into the same practices.  Well, I feel pretty good about this trip.  I am not going to think I won't go and gamble a little bit, but I am going to set myself a limit and stick to it.  

Here is the question though...Is this similar to any addiction and by me saying I will only gamble a little bit really is the same thing as I am going to have only 1 drink?  What happens if I go and once again this strange feeling of not being able to stop takes over again.  I have more money to blow, but that is definitely not a good thing.  I am hoping that most of the gambling came from the fact that the ex and I didn't get along all that well towards the end.  One of the only things we enjoyed doing together was gambling.  I think sometimes I went along only because it meant we could spend time together not fighting.  what do you think?  Am I setting myself up for failure?

One other good thing is that Dane doesn't gamble much at all.  He is much more interested in seeing the sites and visiting the other casinos and not the gambling aspect of Vegas.  I guess we shall see.  Does it help that I at least realize that I had a problem and am aware that I must be careful while on vacation???

Anyway, hopefully I can post again before I leave, but don't hold your breath."

"event","<P>(And for those of you who know me, you already know that I have had about 2 glasses too many) I have decided it is time for an update into the ever-changing life of ME. First let me qualify the statement made above...I did not sleep last night...I tossed and turned and tossed and turned and got up to walk around and shower and still NO SLEEP...I finally fell asleep around 3 am and had to be up at 6:30 am to get ready for work. Whether it is right or not I am trying to ensure I at least get 5 hours tonight. </P>
<P>Now onto more interesting and exciting stuff...</P>
<P>I have truly met an amazing person...someone who makes me laugh and smile...someone who allows me to just be me...someone, who for the first time in a long time, I don't have to worry about...someone who has made me feel extremely lucky...</P>
<P>Thursday night I received a call from Dane who excitedly told me he had won tickets on eBay for the Alabama-LSU game in Tuscaloosa this weekend.&nbsp; Dane is a die-hard LSU fan.&nbsp; He was born and raised in New Orleans and has basically been a Tiger for his entire life, everyone in his family loves LSU, even the cat.&nbsp; He had been sporadically talking about possibly trying to get to this game, but I thought it was more whim than reality.&nbsp; Hello, reality.&nbsp; We discussed if I could get off work a little early Friday afternoon, and I thought I could.&nbsp; We decided to fly to Atlanta, drive to Birmingham, stay in Birmingham, drive to Tuscaloosa Saturday morning, fly out of Atlanta on Sunday.&nbsp; We got flights and hotel reservations, he reserved a rental car, and before I knew it we were headed on our first weekend getaway together.&nbsp; I was excited...I loved the idea that this actually happens and that spontaneity isn't dead.</P>
<P>Friday it was a little hard to concentrate at work, our flight left at 4:50 from Houston and I was busy all morning and early afternoon.&nbsp; He got stuck late in a meeting and didn't end up at the airport till close to 4:20...we rushed to the departing gate and finally ended up on the plane.&nbsp; We were off and we were exhausted.&nbsp; Good conversation and a few beers on the plane made the flight seem like it was quite short and before I knew it we were in Atlanta.&nbsp; Birmingham is about 150&nbsp; miles from Atlanta, so we picked up the car and off we drove to Alabama.&nbsp; Once we found the hotel we drove to a cute little bar in downtown Birmingham where the LSU-Birmingham chapter was having a pregame get together.&nbsp; It was so much fun, beads and Mardi Gras music, the beer they were serving was brewed in New Orleans.&nbsp; We had gumbo and a few beers before heading back to the hotel for some much needed rest.</P>
<P>The next morning I was awoken at 6:30 am to a very excited and eager LSU fan.&nbsp; He had been up since 5 am and run 3 miles, gone to Walgreens (neither one of us brought toothpaste), visited the breakfast buffet and secured both of us some coffee, plus planned the route we were taking to the game.&nbsp; It was actually quite cute...very reminiscent of a kid waiting for Christmas morning...so excited he could barely sit still.&nbsp; I showered and got dressed in my all too neutral black tank top and khaki pants (I did sport a small Geaux Tigers pin on my hoodie), and jumped in the car to an LSU CD playing the fight song and other band collections I would be hearing later that afternoon.&nbsp; We made it to Tuscaloosa and got breakfast and found a place to park.&nbsp; The day was unbelievably beautiful...crisp and clear without a cloud in the sky, little humidity and no wind.&nbsp; A perfect day to watch football, make new friends, and eat lots of great food.&nbsp; ESPN College GameDay was there along with thousands of fans from both schools.&nbsp; Eveyone was nice and cordial with good-spirited taunting and name-calling.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Dane and I walked around and took in the sights.&nbsp; There is a group of guys who dress up for one away game a year as blinged out pimps...they are hilarious...all from LSU, these guys of at least 30+ walk around in purple and gold suits with chalices for their pimp juice and a keg-a-rater full of Red Bull and Vodka, Crown and 7, and beer.&nbsp; They also have music system with all the pimp music you could imagine...they were great and had an immediate following of young college girls trying to get free alcohol and looking for a great time.&nbsp; The guys even have shirts made for the groupies that are pink tight spaghetti straps with their website on the back.&nbsp; They had lots of attention and looked as if they were truly enjoying themselves.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We finally met up with some other LSU fans at their tailgate and had more gumbo, jambalaya, great conversation, and plenty of beer.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my first experience with SEC football and it was an eye opener.&nbsp; They love their booze.&nbsp;&nbsp; At A&amp;M we drink the night before and then after the game, but never before.&nbsp; It is too damn hot and all of our games are in the middle of the afternoon.&nbsp; Everyone in Tuscaloosa regardless of team ties was drinking and dancing and talking.&nbsp; It was awesome.&nbsp; Alot of the sites had big screen TV's with other games playing, people would come and ask for certain types of food or drink, there was great music and plenty of really cool people, and no one was mean or rude or unruly.&nbsp; It was all playful jabbing at the other team, always followed by smiles and laughs.</P>
<P>The game started at 2:30 and we made our way to the stadium about 45 minutes before kickoff.&nbsp; The game was awesome and LSU won in overtime.&nbsp; After the game was over, Dane and I just sat in the stands for a while.&nbsp; We listened to the band play and watched the very disappointed Bama fans leave with their washed out dreams on a National Championship.&nbsp; We just sat and talked and watched and sat.&nbsp; It was great...the perfect ending to a great day.&nbsp; We took pics of the scoreboard and the band and the LSU fans...we marveled in the emotions that people can have for 56 guys who catch a pigskin...we just sat.&nbsp; Finally, we made it back to the tailgate site and had some more food.&nbsp; We stayed for about 2.5 more hours telling jokes and funny stories and getting to know people that Dane, until Saturday, had only talked to online about LSU football.&nbsp; We were invited back whenever we liked, and even asked to tailgate with them at the Florida game next year.&nbsp; Eventually we made it back to the hotel and fell into a dreamless slumber.</P>
<P>The next morning was a hectic mess and we almost got stuck in Atlanta for an additional day.&nbsp; Luckily we made it back to Houston and spend the rest of&nbsp; Sunday relaxing and eating orange sherbert.&nbsp; He took today off and I had to work.&nbsp; When we got home we napped for about 2.5 hours and missed the movie we had planned on seeing.&nbsp; We rented the movie Crash, which I highly recommend if you have never seen it and then finally went to bed.&nbsp; Here is where the trouble started...neither one of us could sleep.&nbsp; We just tossed and turned and keep talking to each other about how bad it sucks not to be able to fall asleep.&nbsp; Finally, after truly contemplating sticking hot pokers in my eyes, I fell asleep...after 3 am.&nbsp; What finally did it...Dane reading to me about what else then LSU football.&nbsp; It was very sweet and greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I worked all day, came home and made a casserole for a pot luck tomorrow at work, showered, and now here I am.</P>
<P>Here I am...what a bold statement.&nbsp; For the first time in a long time I am happy just for the moment.&nbsp; I am living in this exact day and not concentrating on next week, month, or year.&nbsp; It is wonderful...I am happy and my life is full in all aspects.&nbsp; I am thankful...my cup runneth over.&nbsp; I have no idea what has happened but I am not scared, I am just letting everything happen.&nbsp; I still have to remind myself on an every 2 or 3 day basis that it is okay to be happy, but I am learning to deal.&nbsp; I have great friends that give me all the support I need and who I know regardless of what the future holds will be there every step of the way.&nbsp; I feel lucky and full and happy and giddy and not afraid of tomorrow.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It is a good feeling.</P>"

<TD align=middle><FONT size=5><B>Hippie</B></FONT><BR>You are 42% Rational, 71% Extroverted, 28% Brutal, and 28% Arrogant. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>You are the Hippie! Characterized by a strong sense of extroversion, irrationality, gentleness, and humility, you no doubt frolic through fields preaching peace and love to all! You are probably either very spiritual or needlessly paranoid about ""the man"", like most hippies, as a result of your focus on intuition and feelings over cold, brutal logic. You are also very, very social. And like any hippie who would have no qualms about hitchiking across the country just to meet some interesting people, you also love to interact with others, even complete strangers. Because we know most any hippie is peace-loving and humble, it stands to reason that you, as well, are terribly gentle and humble, almost to the point of revulsion. Your carefree attitude of peace and harmony is probably very, very sickening to realists or cynics or anyone who isn't a hippie, to tell the truth. In short, your personality is defective because you are overly emotional, extroverted, gentle, and humble--thus making you an annoying hippie. And you listen to psychadelic rock and smoke a whole lot of pot. Okay, maybe not, but I wouldn't be surprised if you did.
<P>
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational. 
<P>2. You are more EXTROVERTED than introverted. 
<P>3. You are more GENTLE than brutal. 
<P>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.</I> 
<P><B>Compatibility:</B>

<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an extrovert to be classified that way as well. Below is a list of the other personality types so that you can determine which other possible categories you may fill if you scored near fifty percent for certain traits.</I>

<TD align=middle><FONT size=5><B>Kermit the Frog</B></FONT><BR>You scored 62% Organization, 48% abstract, and 67% extroverted! </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD><FONT size=-2>This test measured 3 variables. </FONT>
<P><FONT color=red>First, this test measured how <B>organized</B> you are. Some muppets like Cookie Monster make big messes, while others like Bert are quite anal about things being clean. </FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue>Second, this test measured if you prefer a <B>concrete</B> or an <B>abstract</B> viewpoint. For the purposes of this test, concrete people are considered to gravitate more to <I>mathematical and logical approaches</I>, whereas abstract people are more the <I>dreamers and artistic type.</I></FONT>
<P><FONT color=green>Third, this test measured if you are more of an <B>introvert</B> or an <B>extrovert.</B> By definition, an introvert concentrates more on herself and an extrovert focuses more on others. In this test an introvert was somebody that either tends to spend more time alone or thinks more about herself. </FONT>
<P>You are <B>mostly</B> organized, <B>both </B>concrete and abstract, and <B>more </B>extroverted.
<P>Here is why are you Kermit the Frog.
<P><FONT color=purple>You are both somewhat organized. You have a good idea where you put things and you probably keep your place reasonably clean. You aren't totally obsessed with neatness though. Kermit is also reasonably tidy. He'll even dress up for interviews. <BR><BR>You both are sometimes concrete and sometimes abstract thinkers. Kermit spends a lot of his time as a reporter collecting facts, but he is also the author of the dreamy song ""The Rainbow Connection."" You have a good balance in your life. You know when to be logical at times, but you also aren't afraid to explore your dreams and desires... within limits of course.<BR><BR>You are both extroverts. Kermit gets along with everyone. Sure a few folks annoy him, but that's just because they are annoying. Kermit likes to meet new people when he does his job as a street reporter. You definitely enjoy the company of others, and you don't have problems meeting new people... in fact you probably look forward to it. You are willing to take charge when necessary or work as part of a team.
<P>Oh, and in case you were wondering, Kermit starred on Sesame Street years before The Muppet Show.</FONT>
<P>
<P>The other possible characters are<BR><B><FONT color=brown>Oscar the Grouch<BR>Big Bird<BR>Snuffleupagus<BR>Ernie<BR>Elmo<BR>Cookie Monster<BR>Grover<BR>The Count<BR>Guy Smiley<BR>Bert </B></FONT>
<P>If you enjoyed this test, I would love the feedback! Also if you want to tell me your favorite Sesame Street character, I can total them up and post them here. Perhaps your choice will win! </P></TD></TR>

<P>The Titan Arum, or Amorphophallus Titanum, nicknamed ""corpse flower"" because of its putrid stench, blooms rarely and briefly.</P>
<P>Garden staff have nicknamed the purple flower ""Diva"" and are charting its life on their web site, www.wilhelma.de.</P>
<P>But those keen for a glimpse, or a whiff, in person must be quick: just 24 hours after the 11 year-old plant produced its first flower, the bloom began to wilt on Friday.</P>
<P>The Titan Arum was discovered in 1878 in its sole indigenous habitat, the Indonesian island of Sumatra, and grows in cultivation in only a handful of places around the world.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Its scent has been likened to rotting fish or animal flesh.</LI></OL>
<P>""The smell is crucial to its survival in its natural habitat because it attracts pollinating carrion beetles and flesh flies,"" said botanist Franziska Lo-Kockel.</P>
<P>Lo-Kockel brought the bulb of the plant, weighing some 40 kilograms, from the University of Frankfurt to the Stuttgart gardens 11 years ago. </P>

"event","<P>I truly have no idea what just happened, but I was happily typing away when the livejournal message board flashed on&nbsp;my screen and told me my password was to easy and ""my journal could be hijacked""&nbsp; Quite dramatic if you ask me...</P>
<P>So in other news...</P>
<P>The boy is pretty great. Actually things are really good and it scares me a little to say these things out loud.&nbsp; I like him...alot and no he doesn't read this journal, because at this moment he doesn't even know this journal exists.&nbsp; Because if he did I would never write these things so he could read them...I don't want him to think I am nuts just quite yet.&nbsp; If I ever tell him this site exists he will already know how I feel and I will know he feels the same way and then this petty journal entry won't matter.&nbsp; His name is Dane...pretty cool name although he hates it.&nbsp; He works with a construction management company managing the proposal department.&nbsp; His job sounds pretty technical which involves a lot of writing, which fortunately for him he is very good at.&nbsp; He want to write a novel one day...a novel.&nbsp; 
<P>On Monday, I got to meet some of his friends.&nbsp; We went to a bar to watch the Astros in Game 5.&nbsp; It was fun, and his friends seem great. Of course, the Astros lost but we had a really good time.&nbsp; It is so much scarier meeting friends then parents, which, yes I have already done.&nbsp; Parents hear the word ""doctor"" and automatically believe that she must be a good person, although they know nothing about me besides my job.&nbsp; Friends and siblings are completely different.&nbsp; First, they don't care what I do.&nbsp; Second, they love this guy and want him to be utterly happy, they will judge harder on all levels.&nbsp; I hate the feeling of walking into a place and knowing that everyone is sizing you up from the second you enter the room.&nbsp; Luckily, I can usually make a wall talk back to me so I can usually engage some of them in a conversation and break the ice that way.&nbsp; Tomorrow night I am going to meet his best friend and his fiance.&nbsp; They currently live in Atlanta but will move back to Houston in the next few years.&nbsp; We are going to a party to watch the World Series with what he said is about 80% of the people he knows in Houston.&nbsp; Great, its like the Inquistion...Thank goodness, some of the people I met the other night will be there so I will at least recognize a few familiar faces...if you can call standing in a bar yelling at a TV for 4 hours familiar faces....so yes, I am a little nervous.</P>
<P>The best part about this relationship (if you can call it that...you probably can) is that we communicate so well.&nbsp; I feel like I am in high school again...think living with my mom brings me back quite regularly.&nbsp; I love being around him and I look forward to seeing him although I talk to him every night if I don't see him.&nbsp; I find myself smiling in work and singing really loud in the car while bopping my head up and down...disgustingly happy...oh, I hate this...not really, but feeling this way just brings in the facts that one day it could definitely be over with and again I would have to scrape myself off the floor and move on&nbsp;(or become obsessed with&nbsp;a musical star and post hundreds of pics of her on my blog :)) </P>
<P>That brings around&nbsp;a great point...laying yourself on the line is great, but at the sametime definitely sets you up to have your heart broken, yet once again.&nbsp; I know if I am not willing to take a risk then I won't ever get anywhere, but there is a huge part of me that is so scared of being hurt.&nbsp; The beginning of any relationship is great...all you want to do is spend time together and there is no fighting or wondering or thinking just doing and it is fabulous.&nbsp; Months from now if everything keeps working then you realize you are in over your head and whatever happens will affect who you are as a person and your next dating experience.&nbsp; I know I am rambling, but I haven't found myself in this situation in a while and for the first time in a long time I am happy with myself and believe I deserve to be happy.&nbsp; He makes me happy...that is all I am thinking about right now.&nbsp; I am trying to stay focused on my own life and not let this get out of control too fast...I am trying to remember who I am and what I want without compromising too much.&nbsp; But right now I am happy...and I am just going to go with it, thats all, no overanalyzing or reading too much into anything.&nbsp; The best thing is that I know whatever happens, good or bad, I have great people in my life who aren't going anywhere...and if this goes the wrong way, they will be there to pick me up and put me back together again...</P>
<P>I love you both and miss you already.&nbsp; You have to come to Texas...posting soon on the truck balls...I think the BF would love a pair in his stocking this Christmas C.</P>
<P>His best friend's name is Nick and his fiance is Kathy.&nbsp; As I was talking to Nick tonight he reminded me I have my own Nick and Cathy (although neither one of us would ever call you that because neither one of us like the name much and we know you HATE it, although it does in some strange way make it easier for me to meet these people tomorrow) but if his friends are anything like the two of you he has been one lucky person...</P>"

<P>Okay, well now onto more important matters.&nbsp; I profusely apologize for the recent (okay, not so recent) lack of posting.&nbsp; I could give you a 101 excuses, but really I am probably just a little lazy and when I get home I start to veg on the couch and then go to bed and the idea of posting just gets pushed back and back and back.&nbsp; So I will make a valiant effort to try and do better over the next few days and weeks and months.</P>
<P>I had a fabulous time in Philly...even though I was really excited about seeing the beautiful autumn foliage, but instead I saw a lot of rain and really green leaves.&nbsp; I am so jealous of your pics C.&nbsp;please send me lots of those pics, they make me so happy.&nbsp; This, by far, is the ultimate time to live on the East coast.&nbsp; The smell is so wonderful...I have no idea what it is but the smell is just different and oh, so comforting.&nbsp; Caramel apples in Houston when it is 80 outside just no way bring around the thoughts of Thanksgiving and Fall.&nbsp; Instead you just get pissed off that the caramel is stuck in your teeth...</P>"

"event","<P>It is just after midnight here in Houston, or rather Conroe, which is 30 miles north of Houston.&nbsp; I have just gotten home from picking my sister up from my other sister's house.&nbsp; They left Houston this morning at 4 am and arrived in The Woodlands at around 6 pm tonight.&nbsp; Yes, that is right 12 hours to go 40 miles.&nbsp; It is truly unbelievable what I saw and what they went through.&nbsp; They called and when they could get through would just sit on the phone with pleas for help or an end to this nightmare.&nbsp; They were hot and couldn't run their AC because they were scared they would run out of gas.&nbsp; They finally jumped off the freeway and took some side roads until they found a gas station and a bathroom.&nbsp; It was 97' here today and a heat index of over 105'.&nbsp; They were moving about 2-3 miles per hour.&nbsp; As they said, we would go one car length and then stop for about 15 minutes and then one car length again.&nbsp; </P>
<P>M. my youngest sister isn't married and just wanted to come home, rather than stay with my other married sister and her husband.&nbsp; After all she had been through I could not not go get her.&nbsp; So my mom and I set out about 8 pm tonight to go get her.&nbsp; We live close to I45 which has been made a contraflow interstate for the evacuation.&nbsp; There are over 1.8 million people who are trying to leave the Gulf Coast area and South Houston.&nbsp; As you can imagine the traffic is fucking unbelievable.&nbsp; It is like one huge parking lot.&nbsp; What I saw though brought me to tears...my mom too.&nbsp; There are hundreds of cars pulled over on the side of the highway, children crying, and parents trying to comfort them.&nbsp; They don't know where they are going and when or if they will ever get there.&nbsp; They are beginning to appear hopeless and the look of desperation in their eyes is unfathomable.&nbsp; They are even starting shelters in this area, which is still in the projected hurricane path, but anywhere is better than your car on the side of the road when this monster hits. All of our hotels are full.&nbsp; None of our gas stations have any gas...for hundreds of miles.&nbsp; Many people have either run out of gas or worse their car has overheated.&nbsp; The Texas National Guard&nbsp;has been sent over from NOLA and are filling tanks as we speak.&nbsp; They are setting up roadside emergency stations and rest stops where motorists can fill up their cars with gas and get something to eat and drink.&nbsp; Thank God.&nbsp; Many of these people have been driving on what is&nbsp;quickly approaching 24 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are tired and frustrated and scared and angry and just plain&nbsp;dumbfounded.&nbsp; I wish I could have taken pictures to show you how utterly hopeless the situation is.&nbsp; It broke my heart...I wanted to bring all of them back to my house, but I don't even know if my house will be that safe.&nbsp; I wanted to bring them gas, but we don't have any.&nbsp; I just wanted to help, but all I could do was keep on driving.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We have two guests staying with us from the coastal region and possible a third on the way.&nbsp; One we don't know at all but came with a friend of my mom's.&nbsp; Actually he called and was lost and about out of gas.&nbsp; He was desperate.&nbsp; He started traveling at 2 am this morning and in 16 hours made it 18 miles...arghhh.&nbsp; He is now thankfully asleep upstairs.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So luckily, we got M. and because we are from the area took some back roads home and it only took us about 1.5 hours to go the same distance that usually takes about 20 minutes.&nbsp; She is exhausted and just so glad to be home safely.&nbsp; Below are the closest pics I could find to show you the complete chaos.</P>

<P>I am scared.&nbsp; I am afraid for my family and my friends.&nbsp; I am worried about the only place I have ever called home. I lived here in 1983 when Hurricane Alicia came ashore.&nbsp; I was 8 years old and she was a CAT III.&nbsp; I thought it was fun, we got out of school, we had no electricity, and I played with my friends for 7 straight days.&nbsp; There were trees on houses and massive flooding, but when you are 8 it isn't things you even know to worry about.&nbsp; Being 30 is an entire different story.&nbsp; I can't turn off the TV, I can't stop reading the weatherman blogs, I can't fathom that this is happening 2x in one month.&nbsp; Two CAT IV or higher hurricanes have NEVER hit the US mainland in one year...and now we have 2 hitting withing 300 miles of one another.&nbsp; This storm is a monster and very unpredictable.&nbsp; All afternoon they have said that it looked like it was turning north and was going closer to TX/LA border and possibly causing great harm to many areas affected by Katrina including NOLA.&nbsp; Tonight, she has stared a straight west movement which brings her mere miles east of Galveston.&nbsp; Who knows...they say it won't be for sure until about 12-24 hours before landfall or sometime tomorrow am.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am also so frightened for my friend Nick who is in NOLA with the National Guard.&nbsp; The last time I talked to him he was frustrated and tired and scared. He is there helping, but instead of protecting them, the military is allowing them to basically fend for themselves.&nbsp; It infuriates me, but at the time being I am just praying that Rita steers away from NOLA and that he is safe.&nbsp; Thank goodness <lj user=""tommybarbarella"" />&nbsp; keeps everyone informed about his whereabouts.&nbsp; I am thankful to have them both as my friends and supporters.</P>
<P>Not really in the mood to bash the government or the running of this evacation at the moment.&nbsp; Maybe another time.</P>
<P>For anyone reading this anywhere in the country...MY ADVICE IS TO FILL UP YOUR CAR WITH GAS ASAP.&nbsp; Rita has traveled across the entire Gulf Coast and all the refinieries have been closed down and the crew lifted to mainland.&nbsp; The prices are going to skyrocket.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/images/NA-AG427B_OIL09212005204640.gif""></P>
<P>As you can tell between the two sisters they have caused a huge mess.&nbsp; Energy prices to heat your home will also go up this winter.</P>
<P>All prayers and good wishes are greatly appreciated.&nbsp; My friends all over the country have been truly great.&nbsp; All the phone calls and emails have made me feel so loved.&nbsp; I have had so many offers to evacuate to other parts of the country.&nbsp; It is truly a blessing to have you all as friends.&nbsp; Keep the prayers coming...over the next few days we will need all we can get.</P>

<P>So I figured it out....Since Nick's picture has already been posted online before I couldn't pass this opportunity up.&nbsp; Sometimes the best things happen when you don't expect them.&nbsp; Last night I was unpacking one of my boxes from my move and ran across 2 disposable cameras.&nbsp; I got them developed today and found lots of cool pics from my last weekend in Philly.&nbsp; I also found some from Nick's first weekend with the National Guard.&nbsp; He was so proud in that uniform and I was so proud of him.&nbsp; In light of the circumstances surrounding our crazy world at this moment, I wanted to show you some real faces of our heros.</P>
<P>I miss him terribly and hope he gets home before I get there in October.&nbsp; </P>

"event","<P>I really hate politics.&nbsp; I have never been interested in them and only recently have I begun to understand why.&nbsp; I was raised in a relatively conservative town in Texas...I went to college at Texas A&amp;M, a conservative college...I went to medical school in Des Moines, IA, again, a conservative midwest town...my parents are conservative...my grandparents were/are conservative...it is in my blood, I was born and raised a Republican.&nbsp; For many years I never questioned my political affiliation, the majority of Texas is Republican and conservative, and it is all I knew.&nbsp; I just completed my residency in Philadelphia, and now many things I took for granted I am now questioning.</P>
<P>I AM CONSERVATIVE, I AM A REPUBLICAN, I DO NOT SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT 100%.</P>
<P>For many years I was Republican because my parents were Republican.&nbsp; Heck, all my friends' parents are Republican, most of us didn't have much of a choice or the knowledge to question what we believed.&nbsp; Contrary to popular belief, media is different here.&nbsp; We hear the conservative side, the side that Bush is doing an amazing job and we should name our first born GEORGE WALKER.&nbsp; He is one of us, his parents live in Houston, he was our Governor (and a decent one at that), his dad's library is at A&amp;M, we have watched his daughter's grow-up....loyalty comes from alot more than political affliations here in the South.&nbsp; To many of us (not necessarily me), he is part of our family...since his dad was in office we have watched him mature...we looked at him in times of crisis while he was Governor, and most of the time he came through for us, we remember when his daughters were born, even some remember his marriage...he is tried and true a Texan even though he wasn't born here...we have accepted him as one of our own.</P>
<P>I wish I could give you a glance into the mind set down here...it is so different than any liberal city on the East coast.&nbsp; Many people don't read the paper or listen to the news...they get there information from the hair salon or the coffee shop or the diner or the gas station or their other friends who don't read the newspaper either.&nbsp; They are not dumb or stupid...they are uninformed and yes, it is partially their fault.&nbsp; They don't care, they don't want to change, because it is all they know or have ever known.&nbsp; Their entire family is conservative and on election day they go to their voting places and check the Republican box at the top of the ballot, many times not even reading the names.&nbsp; Sad, but true, many couldn't tell you who ran against Bush at the last election...they don't even know Kerry's name.&nbsp; It is sad, but it is life in small town America in the South, especially here in Texas.&nbsp; The attitude is completely different in any of your big cities...Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and especially Austin...have more educated people and more liberal viewpoints.&nbsp; They begin to question what has always been their lifestyle...the young travel to other places and read and educate themselves on other issues, and many of us change points of our affiliations.&nbsp; I know I have.</P>
<P>Here is a perfect example...When I moved to Philadelphia I became friends with many Muslim doctors who are from the Mideast.&nbsp; It was so interesting listening to their ideas&nbsp;and viewpoints.&nbsp; They are from Syria and Lebanon and Algeria...they are the ones who get racially profiled in airports...they are great people and loyal friends.&nbsp; My grandmother who is 80 years old learned that I had made new friends...then she found out they were Muslim...then she got nervous.&nbsp; She actually told me, ""Don't get involved with these men.&nbsp; They are manipulative and beat their wives.""&nbsp; This statement is so wrong in so many ways...it is hard to blame her though...she was born and raised in Texas and has never lived outside of this state.&nbsp; She has gone to the same church for over 30 years and was married to the same man for over 60 years.&nbsp; She has WASPy friends and does not know any Muslims...she only knows what she hears on TV or reads.&nbsp; She is uninformed and ignorant, not racist.&nbsp; Second, to even listen to her say this infuriates me and at the same time makes me laugh, because none of us have ever know a Chrisitian man who beats his wife or is manipulative...it is only Muslim men...yeah, right.</P>
<P>I am one of the lucky ones.&nbsp; I have had the opportunity to live other places...I have friends of all different nationalities, religions, and beliefs...I have been exposed to liberal viewpoints and been able to question my ideas as well as those of others without being chastisied.&nbsp; I have learned that in Philadelphia, I would still be considered conservative, but here in Texas I am middle of the road.&nbsp; I believe in Pro-Choice and stem cell research and helping the poor...I support the war and the troops....I believe we are making a difference in the MidEast...I AM UPSET WITH THE PRESIDENT'S REACTION TO HURRICANE KATRINA.&nbsp; I do not believe he is a criminal or that he deserves to take all the blame...he screwed up, he should have reacted faster, he should have jumped into a car and drove himself down to NOLA to see firsthand before the relief effort got there.&nbsp; I wanted to see him upset...I wanted to see him pacing the Oval Office waiting to hear that of&nbsp;HIS citizens were off the rooftops and that all the hospitals and nursing homes had been evacuated.&nbsp; I wanted tears and hand-wringing because he was worried about the children and the families that were separated.&nbsp; I wanted there to be a plan, at least a better plan than there was.&nbsp; I want him to admit that HE, not anybody else, let his people down and that he is at least partially responsible for the large loss of life.&nbsp; I wanted more of personal response, I wanted raw emotion, and I got none.&nbsp; I got a President who made jokes about being drunk in NOLA and called the director of FEMA ""Brownie"".&nbsp; I am disappointed in my President and his actions and I deserve answers.&nbsp; I still support him, I am disappointed, I am mad, I am infuriated, I am sad, I can't&nbsp;stop watching the news, I am waiting for answers and I still haven't gotten any.</P>
<P>I am even more disappointed with the City of New Orleans.&nbsp; They are a city who failed their own people...they let their fellow friends and families down.&nbsp; When I was 7 years old, my family was vacationing in NOLA.&nbsp; It is still one of my favorite family trips, we ate crawfish and beignets, we went to the museums and the voodoo shops.&nbsp; We also looked at the levees and my dad 23 years ago said, ""Amy, one day these levees are going to fail and the city of NO is going to flood.&nbsp; The entire city will flood and all it is going to take is one big storm.""&nbsp; My father, 23 years ago, knew this...why wasn't something done.&nbsp; I understand that the Army Corp of Engineers has been asking for years for money to fix the levees and each year Congress has given them less and less.&nbsp; This pisses me off, because now after this, we have to look back and wonder what would have happened.&nbsp; It makes me mad that none of the Presidents over the past 25 years have found it a high enough priority to make Congress give them more money.&nbsp; It was that stupid train of thought that we know it can happen but it hasn't yet so we will test our luck for another year...our luck finally ran out.&nbsp; So if the city of NO and the state of LA and my dad in TX knew that the levees were going to break then implement a damn plan.&nbsp; Don't wait on the cavalry or the President, think for yourselves and develop a plan.&nbsp; If you are not getting the response you need then find another way...save your own people and then take it up with the higher ups.&nbsp; The mayor of NO is just as guilty as the Goveror of LA and the director of FEMA and the President of the United States.&nbsp; He failed his own people...he could have developed a plan.&nbsp; Stock pile supplies in the Superdome, implement your own plan, think for yourself, don't wait for others to come to you, you go to them...climb the mountain and in the end you become the hero and you take the credit, but more important you saved the lives of the people who elected you, the people who trusted you, and the people who needed you the most.&nbsp; Every big city in America has the poor population that is swept under the rug and not until a time of natural disaster do we acknowledge them.&nbsp; It isn't right, it isn't what America is supposed to stand for or represent, but they exist and everyone of us knows they do and we don't do anything to help or make their stories and their lives in the spotlight.&nbsp; It is the Mayor and Governor's responsibility to know the socioeconomic status of their people, what they need, and what we can do to help.&nbsp; We have all been told by our parents and our teachers that you have to learn to depend on yourself, that your life depends on the decisions you make...don't wait for others to make your life, forge your own way.&nbsp; The city officials of NO should have listened to those voices from their past...they could have done better, they could have saved more lives than they did, they could have gotten buses to the neighborhood if they knew that they couldn't get out, they could have implemented a better plan for the Superdome with securtiy and relief efforts, they could have supplied the basic necessities like water...they could have thought for themselves.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The tragedy of NOLA is a failure on so many levels that it is truly unfathomable.&nbsp; I never believed that so many people could have let a part of America down.&nbsp; We have all failed these people in this certain situation, because if this had happened in our town the same results would have happened.&nbsp; There would have been utter despair and loss of life.&nbsp; This is a huge wake-up call for us: &nbsp;the people of America.&nbsp; We deserve answers and more than that, the truth.&nbsp; The hard truth, the truth that makes all of us question what has happened and how we could have helped prevent it.</P>
<P>The beautiful part of horrible situations is the overwhelming love and support that the people of America can give.&nbsp; We are an unbelievable nation, we have the resources and the heart to make a difference.&nbsp; We are doing it now, we are making a difference.&nbsp; We are making sure that these people know that they are not alone and they we, their fellow Americans, will help them rise up from this situation and regain their independence and their dignity.&nbsp; Living in Houston, the evacuaees have many wonderful things to say about the American people's love and support.&nbsp; Tonight I was watching the news and they were showcasing a family who have been given a home and the parents a job.&nbsp; They have 4 small children.&nbsp; One of them is the cutest little boy, about 7 years old, who was wearing a white T-shirt with the words PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN printed on the front.&nbsp; He was smiling from ear-to-ear, he just started school in Houston and got a new backpack and school supplies.&nbsp; When asked if he had anything to say the sweetest words came from his mouth, ""Thank you America.""&nbsp; </P>
<P>They haven't lost their faith and neither should we.</P>"

Today was Monday and that said should be enough.  I hate Mondays...for many reasons but mainly because I can never get a good night sleep on Sunday night.  I sit in my bed and read and think and toss and turn and get up to go to the bathroom and change positions and then start the whole damn cycle over.  The worst part is looking at the freakin clock and seeing the minutes slowy pass away...eventually I fall asleep only to be awoken by my alarm clock mere minutes after passing into that sweet oblivion...then the day starts and the drama of being in an office with far too many female employees begins again.

Today wasn't too bad.  I got some GREAT news...my bestest friend in the whole wide world is pregnant.  I have known her since we were 2...she is also a doc and we went to school together.  Her parents still live in the area and I get to see her whenever she visits.  Her and her hubby have a little girl who will be one next week, she is 4.5 months pregnant with baby #2 and that's right baby #3.  She had her ultrasound today and she is having identical twin girls (they think).  I am thrilled for her.  My family has an older sister (me) and my sisters are identical twins.  It was an interesting childhood but we are really close now and I wouldn't trade them for the world.  K. (my friend) just stopped working and is going to stay home with the babies....she did this before she knew it was twins...and they say hindsight's 20/20.  We have already made plans for me to come help once the babes are here...her eldest will be a mere 17 months old if she makes it to her due date.  Talk about having your hands full.  Anyway happy and good thoughts for a great pregnancy, healthy babies, and an easy delivery will be well-appreciated.  

Thanks for the interesting comments on my love diatribe yesterday.  Still don't know exactly what I think, but I do know that I have different feelings and that is okay.  I truly appreciate the comment about ""codependence"" and the new age thinking.  You are right that being secure in a relationship and wanting to be in that relationship with that person does not make you weak, rather lucky if you ask me.  

So new question/comment for the day...Did love come before sex or sex before love?  Were they one in the same and only after hundreds of years have we separated them or are they completely two different things that we clumped together to justify the other?  I have no clues, but will ponder the thought and write more later."

"event","<P>So I bought my tickets today.&nbsp; It is official, I will flying into Philly on the 11th of October and flying back to Houston on the 16th. I am so excited.&nbsp; I love having something to look forward too.</P>
<P>I was talking to one of my friends tonight and we got on an interesting subject.&nbsp; Do you think people in relationships understand/feel things differently than single people?&nbsp; He is in a relationship and says absolutely not...me, being single, seem to disagree.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I love my life and have great friends and family...as I have said many times recently.&nbsp; I believe I am exactly where I am supposed to be...especially right now.&nbsp; That doesn't mean though that I don't wish I had that person to call when my day was shitty or someone cuts me off in traffic or the bitchy office manager rubs me the wrong way...so you get the picture.&nbsp; I usually tell this to my friends but multiple times over the past few months I have wanted that feeling of securtiy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The feeling that someone&nbsp;smiles when they see it is&nbsp;you on the other end of the phone, or the great contmentent of waking up in the arms of someone who cares.&nbsp; I definitely think being in a relationship open up emotions that being single are not available.&nbsp; Maybe it is a&nbsp;defense mechanism so you don't just&nbsp;jump into relationships to get those feelings, and if that is the case I am thankful.&nbsp; Relationships scare the shit out of me anyway and to pine for one would leave me feeling even more&nbsp;vulnerable that I&nbsp;already do.&nbsp; </P>
<P>He thinks just having people who care about you should bring about any emotion, and that me feeling differently is only because I allow myself to feel that way.&nbsp; Understandable...I think, but still disagree.&nbsp; I have too many emotions already, but the ones I still want come from that anxious, about to vomit sensation that happens when you look into the eyes of someone and see that same emotion staring back at you.&nbsp; I am such a pathetic girl.</P>
<P>Maybe that is just it...maybe as females we put too much emphasis on a relationship and the words/feelings that are associated with it.&nbsp; But if you can have all the same emotions with or without a significant other then why do we put ourselves through the hell of falling in love.&nbsp; It is a great feeling when it is actually working, but sure sucks as soon as it is over.&nbsp; </P>
<P>For me, there is definitely a world that is opened up when I am in a relationship.&nbsp; It is a feeling of security and want and peace and belonging.&nbsp; It is a great feeling that nothing compares too.&nbsp; I don't get that from my family or friends and that is okay...it isn't a feeling I want all the time because when it happens I still want it to be special.</P>

"event","<P>I decided to post again today although not much has happened in my life since my long winded tale last night.&nbsp; It felt good to let it all out though.&nbsp; I, again, appreciate all the support not only right now but over the past few months and years.&nbsp; It is funny to look back and see how much I have grown.&nbsp; I still think I could benefit from a therapist and will probably look into it when my insurance kicks in, which happens in November.&nbsp; Until then, I just have a COBRA policy and have to pay everything out-of-pocket.&nbsp; Excuses, excuses.</P>
<P>Work went well today, no call from the boy...I didn't even think about it though until tonight.&nbsp; It is amazing how well our hearts and minds heal.&nbsp; Sometimes it takes awhile but we all come around.&nbsp; So I have now been contemplating getting back on the horse and continue with my online dating fiasco.&nbsp; It is a little scary, but I have to admit it is fun meeting new people, and what the hell, you never know what will happen.&nbsp; The problem is, I once again have that I am a piece of meat feeling.&nbsp; Last time I didn't really deal with that because I met the boy on night one and things went from there.&nbsp; I will just give it a little time.</P>
<P>I started reading <FONT color=#3366ff><U>A Prayer for Owen Meany</U> </FONT><FONT color=#000000>last night and find it alot like the movie, <U>Simon Birch.</U>&nbsp; The part that involves his mom dying especially.&nbsp; Does anyone know if this movies was made from parts of the book?&nbsp; I love the book so far though, although I have only read Chapter 1 (it was 40 pages though).</FONT></P>
<P>I am definitely coming to Philly to visit in October though.&nbsp; I love having something to look forward too.&nbsp; It makes things go by so much faster.&nbsp; Only 50 days or something crazy like that...I am smiling as I type this.&nbsp; The weather in Philly in October is awesome and I can't wait to feel that nice crisp air.&nbsp; Plus I really want to go to Linvilla Orchards for their pumpkins and caramel apples.&nbsp; Already dreaming and planning...</P>
<P>So not much else to say, this post has been quite boring.&nbsp; I did do 48 chin-ups at the gym tonight.&nbsp; They were assisted with some machine, but still I was so happy to be done and that I could actually do them.&nbsp; I also bought a new watch at Ann Taylor Loft this weekend for $12.50 and I love it.&nbsp; The price just makes it that much better.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Don't ya'll start school sometime soon?&nbsp; I am so jealous, if I could afford it I would 100% be a lifelong student.&nbsp; My next pursuit would be history and Europen architecture....a big change from medicine but so fascinating.&nbsp; Ok enough rambling...</P>"

"event","Hello!  Sorry again for the long absence but sometimes life calls for action in other parts.  I don't even know if that was the entire reason, but I wasn't completely happy in my life and writing it or typing it only seemed to make it more real...more than I could deal with at the moment.  I have come to grips with most of it now and will share with the you, the gory details (not really that gory, but it sounded good).

So I did finally meet the boy, but unfortunately it wasn't quite what I had originally expected.  He go to Texas on Wednesday the 10th and went to his parents house.  I spoke with him both Wednesday and Thursday, he even sent me new pics of himself on Thursday morning, but we didn't make any plans for Friday.  So Thursday evening I called him and left him a message, okay left him 2 messages, but never heard from him.  Being the girl that I am especially one with irrational thoughts I just knew that he was never going to call again (I am so pathetic).  On Friday, he did call while I was in the OR and we played phone tag for the rest of the afternoon.  He, again, made no references about plans for the evening.  He had a meeting with some guys at his job and told me he would call me as soon as he got out...that just happened to be Saturday morning.  At this time, I should have realized that something wasn't right, but I pushed on.  He had gone out with his buddies at school and some had come over from Fort Hood and gotten drunk.  Now, I don't care that he went out with his friends but I at least deserved a phone call or something...I mean we did talk on the phone for over 2 months and had the first weekend we were meeting planned out to the minute.  Obviously, I was the only one who actually took our conversations seriously.  So when we finally talked on Saturday he was on his way to his parent's house to get some of the things he had left there.  He said his dad was going to throw them out if he didn't come get them.  I was a little unhappy, but nonetheless still excited about meeting him.  We then made plans for Sunday...he was supposed to leave his parents and come to my house and we were to have dinner.

****Insert scary story here****
Before I talked with him on Saturday I was on the web looking at some stuff and decided to look him up on the site I met him on.  When I typed in his screen name it said he was online from Gainesville, Florida.  I freaked out.  At this time I believed I was talking with someone who lived in another state and was some scary, perverted rapist who was now stalking me.  I decided this was God's way of telling me that meeting him was out of the question.  I, of course, asked him about this and he gave me a very believable story that he hadn't been on the web in over 2 weeks and that he swore it wasn't him.  It actually freaked him out just about as much because he didn't know how someone had actually logged onto his page with his password.  I knew he was telling the truth because I was on the phone with him and looking at the web which said he was online, but he was in his jeep driving.  He later got off the site completely and made me check so I would believe him.
****End of scary story****

So I got up Sunday morning, went to the gym, showered, and even shaved my legs.  I was pissed off at myself for shaving my legs, because I really didn't believe I would meet him and a lot of the magic had worn off by now.  Anyway, I never got dressed but instead read Harry Potter in my pj's all day.  It was very relaxing and I love Harry Potter and I have no idea what I am going to do when the seventh and last book comes out.  Sorry for the random thought.  Around 4:30 pm he called...you guessed it, another story.  His brother and sister-in-law and their kids had come to his parent's house for dinner and he didn't feel like he could leave, but he would still come by my house later that evening and we could at least get a drink.  That plan was silly, because we both had to work on Monday so we decided to try it another day.  On Monday, he called in the am and I called him back at lunch.  He wanted to come my way that evening for dinner.  I agreed and told him I would get back to him when I was done seeing patients.  I got finished early and called him.  He said he was really busy and it would be easier for me to come to him rather than him to me.  By this point all I wanted to do was meet him and get it over with.  I had been somewhat miserable all weekend because my fairytale ending didn't happen, and I was becoming very disillusioned with the entire situation.  We made plans to meet at a restaurant around 5:30 that night.  I immediately got nervous and went home to shower and dress.  I showered, shaved my legs again, and got ready.  I wore a white tank top and pink linen skirt.  I thought I looked good.  I spoke with the boy multiple times on the way to the restaurant.  One comment he made made me very suspicious...""I am glad we get to meet early, so we can make sure you get home before it gets too dark tonight.""  Now I am not so sure about you, but for me I think that a boy who has never met a girl but has been talking to her for over 2 months might want to spend more time with her then just being in a restaurant for 2 hours.  What do I know though?  So we met and we ate and we talked and we had a good time.  He didn't dress up, he didn't even seem so excited.  He wore a tshirt and shorts and there were other things that happened that you already know about so I won't put them on here unless this is ever read by someone who might get their feelings hurt.  I left the restaurant while it was still light, I got a good hug, no kiss and got in my car with a pretty disappointed feeling in my chest.  I talked with him when I got home for 30 minutes or so and that is it.  We have played phone tag over the past week but that's it...unfortunately, I think I am okay with that.

For those of you who now me (okay, both of you know me pretty well) this time last year I would have never been okay with this situation.  I would have called and called and cried and almost begged for something to happen.  Not this time though,  I deserve better.  I deserve someone who is just as excited as I am and is willing to put in the time and effort that a relationship takes.  Who knows, maybe he met someone else...which is okay.  It is hard for me to believe that though, because over the weekend he said multiple times that he wasn't talking to anyone else ""he had his hands full with me.""  Maybe he didn't think I was attractive.  That too is okay.  He had seen pics of me though and they were from my birthday so they basically look just like I still do.  Because I am a girl, I tend to think that he probably thought I was a ""big"" girl and didn't want to date a fatty.  Now don't jump to any conclusions.  Yes, I am so much happier with myself than I have ever been, especially the way I look.  I am going to the gym 5-6 times per week for noone but myself.  If this guy couldn't see past that then SCREW HIM  because I definately deserve someone so much better than that.  

So you are wondering what I thought of him...I wasn't bowled over, but willing to give it a go.  There were things that I find important that he didn't have, but he was working on them.  We all have our flaws and that is what makes us special.  We have a great time talking and I think he is a remarkable person regardless if I ever talk or see him again.  The things he believes in and stands up for are awesome.

Yes, I am a little sad, because as we have all said, expectations do happen and they did here.  I thought it was going to be some magical weekend and it turned it to a 2 hour dinner with no fireworks.  It was pretty hard to take for the first few days but I am doing much better now.  I keep reminding myself that I deserve someone who is willing to go that extra mile for me and until I find that I am completely happy by myself.  My life is still very full with people who love and care about me all over this country.  I still want to fall head over heels in love and have that good sick feeling in my tummy when I think about that special someone, but until then I will have to wait.  I am proud of myself for realizing all this...I am proud that I can finally truly believe that I deserve to be happy and sometimes not eveything works out as originally planned.  I have no idea what will happen with this relationship, but there are NO expectations as of today.  The magic is gone and I don't know if I can get that back.  Yes, it sucks but getting easier everyday.  If I look at it in the glass half full way, I have had 2 dates in 6 weeks...better than I have done in a while.  I still believe I will find that special someone I just don't know when or where.  

I need to thank my friends who have put up with my emotional mood swings over the past 2 1/2 months.  YOU ROCK!!!  I know at times I was a little crazy and somewhat whimsical but ya'll helped me stay grounded and tuned into my own life.  It has definitely helped when things didn't go as expected.  I also appreciate you letting me have my dreams and not crushing them with pessimistic thoughts or wisdom.  It is so good to have people who love you and allow you to be you, crazy or not.  I miss you all so much and could use coffee in the park with the sun shining on you about now.  Thank you again though,  you are part of why my life is full and happy."

GREAT NEWS X 2:)
#1:  I PASSED MY FREAKING BOARDS...BOTH PARTS.
#2:  THE BOY IS COMING HOME ONE WEEK FROM TODAY NOT ON FRIDAY BUT ON TUESDAY.

Okay, now I can breathe.  I found out tonight that I passed both parts of my boards.  It is such a relief, the classic monkey off your back phrase applies well here.  I was really worried but am now so happy and feel like I am in a surreal world at the moment.  I just don't believe it is true, I will keep looking back on the computer until I actually get it back on paper.  Anyway, I am so relieved and happy and so much more relieved.

Second, the boy already left Washington and will be home on the 9th.  That is right 3 whole days early.  I don't know if I will actually see him any earlier but at least he will be here.  I have to work in downtown Houston on Thursday and Tuesday is my mom's birthday so both of those nights are out.  Then I have to get an office pic taken Thursday night and then out with the whole office crew for drinks...so it still looks like Friday but he said he might come up here first.  Yes, happy again but really stressed out and nervous.  All is well with us and we are both super excited about seeing each other finally, but still when I think about it I get butterflies.  Butterflies today are okay though.  I don't want to get too excited though or talk about it too much because it makes me feel like I will jinx the situation.

Third, which I forgot to mention above...I leave on Friday for San Antonio and a weekend away with my girlfriends.  We plan on just hanging out and I am so excited...so excited.  I haven't seem them in a while and it should be so fun.

So as you can tell I have a lot to be thankful for right now.  My life is okay, that scares me but I am trying to learn to embrace it.  Sometimes that is harder than you think.  

Wishing all of you peace and contentment and happiness today.

Boy am I a dork."

"event","Just a quick update.  This morning so far has been pretty good.  The doc I work with is on vacation so we didn't have any cases today, so I got the day off.  Pretty nice I must admit.  I slept a little later and then went to the gym.  Now I think I will go introduce myself to some of the places around the city.  That is what the office manager wants me to do today, market myself.  And that is fine, except that I don't have any business cards...how do you market yourself when you don't have any business cards.  They gave me a stack of cards that advertises the business and told me to write in my name, but I think that looks pretty tacky if you ask me.  So I will go do my duty but wait and go to the nice places and other doctor offices until I have my own cards.

I have no idea if anyone watched the new series on FX the other night.  It is called Over There and is about the Iraq war and American soldiers getting over there.  A good part of the hour was done looking through nightvision goggles.  It started by showing the soldiers leaving their families...moms leaving their babies, husbands leaving their wives and little children, young boys leaving their parents...it was quite emotional.  Then it shows them on the plane on the way and they all have this shellshocked look on their face, they are scared to death but trying to be so strong.  The next thing you see is them behind a pile of dirt and being shot out by guns and missiles.  It seemed like a lot to handle.  I read an article about it in the paper and they said the pilot episode was toned down so people would turn in to the next ones.  I found it hard to watch, interesting but hard to watch. The paper said it would be really hard for soldiers who had fought or families with loved ones over there, or anyone who has lost someone to watch.  I would agree.

Last night I was talking to the boy and we got on this subject.  He just got back from Iraq in March and still doesn't want to talk about it much.  He was in charge of a lot of soldiers over there and was in direct combat.  He was telling me that one of the officers was asking him about his experience in Iraq sometime yesterday.  He told him the basics and then that he didn't want to talk about it anymore.  He said something to me last night though that really sticks.  ""It is not like I wasn't scared, scared to death that is, but I had all these young soldiers looking to me for strength.  It was really hard to put on that strong face when I was so scared.  I had never been to war before either.""  It gave me chills running down my spine as he said it.  That is not the exact quote but close to it.  Here is an officer that has been trained since high school at one of the best military schools in the nation, telling me very candidally how scary the experience was.  He has said multiple times that it is something he doens't really like to talk about because none of us would be able to understand the uncertainity of if tomorrow will ever come.  And he is right, I have no idea how he feels.  I have never been on a plane going to a warzone and wondering if I was ever going to make it back.  I have never woken up in the morning knowing I was going out into an active combat zone not knowing if I would be back that night.  It is so scary...it makes me really proud of him though.  These soldiers have such loyalty to this country, he has said if they ask him to go back to Iraq he will go...because that is what he is supposed to do.

He is a pretty remarkable person.  They are all remarkable people.

So maybe not a quick update, but something that has been on my mind.  I leave for San Antonio in a week and I can't wait.  We are staying at an old hotel that has been renovated next to the Alamo.  Then the boy comes home in 2 weeks.  Only 2 more weeks..."

"event","so i finally decided to post something.  i am not so sure what yet, but lets see what comes out of my head.  first, i must blame my lack of posting on something...lets see---hmmmmm----my mom's computer sounds good.  it is so f***ing slow, dial up that is that i refuse to even check my emails daily.  okay i feel much better know that i blamed someone else...wink wink.

my life at this moment is okay.  work is good, a little challenging at times but still good.  i don't get along great with one of my office managers though (we have 2 thank goodness).  she talks to me like i am her child.  yes, she is old enough to be my mom but she doesn't get to talk to me like a kid.  anyway, we worked out our issues, i still think she has it out for me.

second, my 3 roommates from college called tonight.  they are planning a girls weekend in san antonio the first week in august.  i am so excited.  i really need a vacation and to get to take one with three of my best friends makes it all the better.  they already have a room and appointments at the spa across the street for manicures, pedicures, and facials.  truly pampering ourselves, i guess.  what makes it even better is that we have no plans, no reservations, no people to see...rather we can just lounge around the pool, drink, and talk and talk and talk.  i haven't seen them in about 3 years.  they are all married and i can't believe we all have the same weekend open with such short notice.  as you can tell by my rambling i am pretty excited.

third, my personal life.  suprisingly it also is okay right now.  i took everyone's advice and met the guy on thursday night.  i did feel a little guilty but went anyway.  he was super nice and we could talk for hours but there was no physical attraction for me.  i think i am too excited about meeting this other guy too.  all in all, though, it was worth going and learning that i actually know what i want and am just not lonely.  i appreciate everyone's advice on the subject though...i am sure there will be plenty more armchair psychiatry meetings in the near future.

fourth, the boy comes home in 17 days.  i can't actually believe i am writing about this online, but since i don't get to see you guys anymore...we will have to make do for now.  i don't want to say too much....really superstitious about this...but things are good.  we both seem to hope that when we finally meet that things continue as well as they have been for the past 7 weeks.  i am getting pretty excited though, and the days just seem to be getting longer instead of shorter.  i am sure my trip to san antonio will be a well needed distraction.  

so as you can tell, i do realize that my move to texas was the right move for me.  i miss everyone in philly so much, plus the city has so much to offer, but i am happy here and this is where i should be.  it sucks to grow up and make the right decisions sometimes.

oh yea, i am so proud of myself.  i joined the gym here in town and i have been 5 times each week since i got here.  i have never been so gym loyal before.  it feels good though and i look forward to going.  it is definitely a great way to unwind at the end of a long day.

hope all is well with yall.  talk to you soon."

"event","sitting in my house in texas feeling a little sad and lonely tonight...not so sure why but am okay with it. it feels good sometimes to just sit and think.  i find it makes me more aware of the good parts of my life.

starting week 2 of my new working woman life tomorrow and believe it or not i am a little nervous...don't ask me why, but nonetheless a little nervous.  had a good weekend of not doing too much.  i joined a gym and went all weekend...it gives me something to do just for myself.  i had some long talks with my mom which are always great.  i got the new harry potter book which i am so excited about, but must finish the other book i am currently reading before i can start it.  i also bought 4 other books...yes i am addicted.  they are ""the lady and the unicorn"", ""everything is illuminated"", ""middlesex"", and ""high fidelity"".  i can't wait to get into all 5 of them.  i also have empire falls and a prayer for owen meany to read as well.  is it strange that it makes me happy to have a surplus of books that i have never read?

on a personal note...need some advice.  yes, i know that only two of you read this, but any unsolicited advice is greatly appreciated.  so as you know i have been talking to a boy for about 6 weeks now...he will be home in 3 more weeks.  everything is fine there.  since i have been home though boys have been coming out of the woodwork...so many friends and family members want to set me up with different people.  i have had quite a few emails and phone calls. so what do i do?  i feel a little funny actually going out on a date but what if the first boy and i don't have anything in common when we finally meet.  have i then wasted all this time when i could have found somebody else?  is it really harmful to go have a drink or dinner with someone?  then the question arises...what if you like that guy but still haven't met bachelor #1.  he at least deserves a chance, doesn't he...
i have no idea...right now, i am still excited about meeting the boy, but then my apprehensive side kicks in and i start to get scared.  there has been no conversation about whether or not other dating can go on between me and the boy...but lets face it...he is on an army base with a thousand other cadets...help!!!!!!!!!!

looking forward to any help i can get...have a good one."

"event","Day 3 goes something like this:
Yesterday was my first real day all alone.  It is amazing how intimidated you feel entering a room where you are supposed to be the expert.  My first true patients were all quite nice and the morning flew by.  I had some challenging moments but all-in-all a pretty good day.

Awoke this am with a rather sinking feeling in my belly.  I haven't been sleeping very well lately because Tex believes he must keep me up all night by lying directly on top of my head.  I think he is still scared of his new surroundings.  Plus my mom has a female cat that is not fixed and she goes in heat every time I go home because of Tex's smell, now that he is here she is the horniest little cat.  The aggressive female scares Tex.

Patients went well and we had a party for one of the girls who works at the office.  I still have the great honor of having men stare at my chest rather than my face.  If they could have only seen them this time last year.  I think I am going to start putting my name on my boobs so at least they can request to see them again.  It must be nice to be a guy.  Can you imagine if we all crawled around on our knees so we could stare at their packages?  Men, being egotistical (spelling?) would probably think they were deserving of some oral treats if this was the case.  Anyway, there could definitely be worse situations and you know what they say, WHATEVER IT TAKES, I have student loans out the  butt and can use all the patients I can get.

Reading Little Earthquakes, better than I expected.  I love J. Weiner."

"event","Hi all!  Yes, I have finally arrived in Texas safe and sound thank goodness.  And I did become a bona fide member of the working class today.  All in all, life is okay.  It is so weird being back in my hometown and so far away from what I was calling home.  The trip from Lititz to TX was relatively uneventful once my poor car was fixed and we got started.  So I ended up doing 3500 dollars worth of damage to my car but the people in Maryland are great and fixed it for me in only 3 short days.  While I was waiting for my car to run again I was forced to take a much needed vacation.  Since I was homeless and stuck in Lititz M. and I just played.  We slept late and drank coffee in bed while reading books and magazines.  We went shopping at the outlets and we cooked one hell of a dinner for her husband.  Looking back now, it all seems okay.  The trip home consisted of leaving MD at 2:00 pm on Friday and stopping in Nashville around midnight.  We stopped at scary motel that had sticky carpet and sheets that were too little for the bed.  My cat had no idea where he was so all he did was cry all night long.  By 5 am I wanted to throw the cat out the window and pull all my hair out...I was so damn tired.  We got going by 6 am and arrived in my hometown at 6 pm.  1700 miles and about 24 hours in a car.  M. is such a great friend...I am lucky to have her in my life.  Sat night we went out to dinner with ""my daddy, Richard"" (the name he calls himself) for BBQ and it was sooooooooooo good.  Sun I showed M around and we had fabulous Mexican food and margaritas.   She left this am and I already miss her...I was so nervous about starting my job that I couldn't even concentrate that this would be the last time I see her for months...sad face...

So this morning I had to be at work at 6:30 am dressed in business attire with a smile on and ready to learn.  It was better than expected and really effing weird.  People kept looking at me like I knew what I was talking about...well, I probably do more than they do but still only 11 days ago I was still a resident and being taught and now I am the teacher...ahhhhhhhhh!!!!  I worked all day with my boss and tomorrow they throw me to the fishes...he is going on vacation in 10 days so needs me to learn the ropes ASAP...quite frightening if you ask me.  Now I am home and trying to adjust being in my car all the time...traffic blows.  I love being around my family but miss everyone in Philly...i still feel like i live there and am just home for a visit.  I will be going to bed shortly because I have to go to work tomorrow again...no more easy days for a while...I think I will visit friends in Galveston this weekend and next weekend my best friend is  coming from MO.  I can't wait to see her and her little girl.
Until tomorrow...hope all is will with yall."

"event","Well, I am still here and alive so I should just be thankful....but to ya'll I will bitch and whine just a little.


It all began yesterday about 5:30 am when M. woke me up from her apt in Lititz.  We packed the car, made sandwiches, and were excited about our road trip.  Off we went thru the Amish land to the turnpike.  18 miles later on the turnpike we found 81S that would take us 495 miles south to TN.  We passed the Mason-Dixon Line and had just arrived in Maryland when it began to pour down rain.  We had to pee because we though drinking coffee in the am was ok and decided to pull off in Hagerstown, MD.  As we made the off ramp we slowed to 20-25 mph and began to hydroplane to the left.  There was really nothing we could do about it so we just tried to avoid flipping the vehicle.  As we approached the median we were headed with both the drivers side wheels getting close to the curb.  I truly believe that if we hadn't turned the car ever so slightly we would have flipped....but we didn't and all we got was a scared kittty and a few big bumps on our heads.  We pulled the car over to the side of the road and jumped out crying and acting 100% like girls into the pouring rain.  We walked or more liked ran multiple times around the car and didn't see too much damage.  The driver's side wheel was pretty scratched up and the tire looked a little strange but it wasn't a blow-out at least (now I only wish that was the problem).  We jumped back in the car and decided to drive to the Exxon station down the road and have someone do a quick once over.  As we drove off, smoke started coming from the wheel well and the most horrible sounds were coming from my car.  We couldn't turn the wheel or really control much what was happening so we just crossed our fingers and prayed we made it the 1/4 mile to the station.  


Once at the station, we found some nice guys at the Michelen shop who came out and must have been from West Virginia...they had all their teeth but their vocabulary left a little to be desired.  We finally figured out what they were trying to tell us that we were basically fucked.  ""That there car looks pretty beat up, and them tires look cockeyed.""  So, next we made the call to Daddy Richard and he led me through the rig-a-ma-roll of calling the insurance company and having my car towed.  Thank goodness for Daddies.  When I signed up for my insurance, my daddy made me get towing and rental car. I put up a fight because I didn't want to pay the extra $10 a month but boy was I glad yesterday.  I talked to the nice lady at Geico (they are super nice and really helpful if you ever need to change companies) who set me up with towing and found me the nearest Honda dealership.  She then called Enterprise and set me up with a rental car.   The tow company said they would be back there in about 1-1/2 hours.    


So we unpacked the cooler and had lunch while sitting in my car in Hickville, USA.  My poor cat was panting with his tongue out and his eyes kept rolling back in his head.  I panicked and thought he had internal injuries because he wasn't in his cage when the wreck happened and started to tear up again.  I then inspected him and found he looked okay, I think he was just scared and really hot.


The scary men at the gas station only got scarier.  One guy even tried to play chicken with my car.  We are sitting in it with the flashers on and yes, we have been there for about 3 hours now, when this dumbass started blowing out his chest and hitting it like a gorilla while pointing to my car.  He then proceeded to gun his car and come straight for my car until he slammed his brakes on about 1 inch from my hood.  M. stuck here head out and gave a little of her Italian attitude to the man with the mullet and he finally backed off.  It was quite a lovely seen...DUMBASS REDNECKS.  This happened 2 more times until a man pulled up behind us in his pick-up and started honking.  We, of course, couldn't move so we just sat there politely ignoring the ever-increasing car honking.  M. was inside using the restroom and heard him tell the lady that two girls were sitting in their car blocking a lane and he wanted an announcement made that it needed to be moved.  Her answer, ""They rolled in here about 3 hours ago, and there car was all smokey and their wheel is lopsided.  I don't think they can move it.""  At least we made some friends at the AC&T.


The tow company finally arrived after 4 hours and a cancelled job and I finally got my rental car and went to the dealership.  After a grueling hour of waiting they informed me with a smirk that I had totally fucked the underside of my car and needed about 20 parts replaced.  Of course, not all the parts are in and best case scenario is that it will be ready Friday evening.   My job, which I am supposed to start on Friday, will have to wait and my car with its $1000 deductible will get a new wheel and whatever else.


So still in the northeast with all ya'll damn yankees...i just can't seem to leave.  Anyway, lights just went out here in Lititz...I think the Amish are striking...update more later.  Peace."

"event","Well today finally happened and yes my emotions found me before I left the city.  I have cried and cried and my eyes will be puffy tomorrow.  I am sure you are suprised that I am actually posting but felt like I needed this to stay close for as long as possible.  

First, I want to thank both of you for a fabulous weekend.  It is just what I needed to leave the city with.  I have learned so much over the past two years and this weekend was an epitome of a lot of that learning.  It makes me feel better knowing that you have each other to take care of and I know that is enough to keep many people busy for many days.  As I was driving north on 95 this evening I could see Philly fading in the background and I cried again.  I know it is not the city that has any of the memories but I BELIEVE that the past 3 years could be my happiest years in my grown up life.  I am becoming comfortable in my own skin finally and it feels great.  I am not scared of my opinions or  my differences but rather cherish them and love the fact that these things make me different.

Second, I would have stayed in Philly in a second if deep down I felt it was the right thing.  Unfortunately, in my heart I know I belong in Texas or at least the South.  I have a lot of people to teach a bunch of things too, especially my family and close friends who are ultra conservative.  I know that you, my friends, will find me there and love me no matter where I am.  That is another great feeling. 

So in the end, today will go down as one of the toughest days in my life, and I appreciate both of you for being there for this.  You made it bearable and gave me the strength to leave.  I love you."

"event","So today is the day...my movers come to pack away all my stuff and then trek off with it to Texas.  Of course, they were supposed to be here by 3:00 and now it is almost 5 and no movers, but none-the-less they are on the Turnpike (or said the man who just called).  It is really weird sitting in a house with all of your belongings packed away neatly in little brown boxes.  It makes me realize that it wouldn't be very fun to go through life without certain possessions to remind you who you are and where you came from.  By this I mean...one of my favorite pics is of my sisters and I on the beach about 22-23 years ago.  We are all wearing matching bathing suits and have our hair in pigtails, but the smiles we have on our face are so genuine...we had little worries, but had no clue how good we had it.  That pic brings back so many good memories of the beach with my grandparents and us being young.  Now that I worry about everything it does me good to remember those times of mindless childhood where the days consisted of playing with your friends, riding your bike, and fighting over who had the best Barbie.  That pic is now residing carefully packed in newspaper in a brown box ready for yet another adventure.

My subject today brings me to a very unsettling feeling I have been experiencing lately...EMOTIONLESS.  I have been so emotional for the past few weeks, crying over nothing and having mood swings that some would think require meds to normalize the storm.  Recently, I have become void of emotion...not completely happy and not sad but indifferent.  I think it is a really well-devised defense mechanism allowing me to exist everyday without breaking down and not being able to coherently go on.  Maybe it comes from somewhere deep inside that has existed in all of us for eternity but we are only able to tap into during certain situations in our life. 

I said goodbye to our office staff today and my attendings.  I truly believed I would bawl my eyes out and leave there a blubbering idiot...but instead I said my goodbyes gave my hugs and kisses and walked out of the building without having shed a tear.  It is not that I am not sad but I can not find my emotions at the moment.  I am sure they are there somewhere, but come on, a few tears would be nice.  I am so scared I will leave here and not be able to express to certain people how much they mean to me and how much I have appreciated their love and support over the past 3 years. Hopefully, most of these people already know how I feel, but I would like to mention it to them again.  I have done a lot of growing while here in Philly and have so many to thank for the new and improved me.

I am also scared that 2 months from now some little thing is going to set off a string of emotions that I won't be able to control.  You know those stupid things that really don't matter that much in life but for so reason at that exact moment it seems like the end of the world.  Then I will be back in Texas and my mom or sisters won't be able to relate and again, I will feel alone.  So I am going to try and find my emotions over the next few days, maybe they are hiding under my bed and when the movers come today they will pop out and surprise me.  Since I am no longer required at work I will have plenty of time to walk around the city and soak up some of the ""philliness"" before I depart for the 28 hour drive to Texas.  If I don't find me emotions before then I am sure they will find a little corner to hide in my car to go home with me."

"event","So it is so damn funny how life goes sometimes.  Things that you are actually dreading become better just by chance.  Yes, probably rambling...but life right now is going okay...little skeptical about admitting that because then I get nervous that it will take a turn for the worse.  My dear friends keep reminding me to live in the moment, be happy, and all that other good shit.  Fortunately, I think they are right and it is nice to be reminded of this on a somewhat daily basis.

My movers come next Monday or Tuesday and then I am off on the 5th.  I have a great friend who has actually volunteered to drive back to Texas with me...it is so nice of her and makes me much less nervous about the ride.  I don't think Tex will appreciate it much though because he just got stuck in the back...oh well.

It still hasn't sunk in yet that I am leaving.  Yes, there are boxes all over my house and all my personal pics and favorite things are currently residing in a brown box, but my mind refuses to grasp the concept.  I believe this is partly my fault for refusing to think about, but also I have an overwhelming sense of peace and I sure didn't create that.  Maybe this is what is supposed to be happening...in all aspects I am just along for the ride."

"event","I woke up this morning and for the first time in years I didn't think..oh, I have to go study (actually I really did think that but then reminded myself I didn't have to).  So, I rolled over and curled back up under my blanket and slept for another hour.  It was great, that restful sleep where you forget about all your problems and just relax.  I then got up, made a pot of coffee and just sat on my couch.  I just sat there for a long time and didn't do anything.  I didn't even get myself a cup of coffee.  I just sat and stared and thought.  In a way, I think I was realizing that this is the start of a turning point.  For the first time, I was letting myself believe in change (the good and bad parts).  I started thinking of so many things...and believe it or not, they weren't the sad, tearful, cry-your-eyes-out thoughts, but rather serene thoughts about life.  For about 2 hours, I was honestly okay with what is about to happen...then I started to remember the sucky parts of moving and didn't feel so good after all.

But for those 2 hours I felt peaceful.

Yesterday, after finishing the boards (BTW:the 2nd part truly rocked my world...they might be laughing at my answers)I went to hang out with one of my co-residents.  He is getting married next weekend.  We had a celebratory drink and then out for sushi.  His fiancee and her sister came with us.  When we got to the restaurant they escorted us straight to a table and we all sat down.  Not two minutes later the waiter arrives with 4 champagne glasses and a bottle of Korbel.  My friend and I are amazed because we have no clue any of this is happening.  His fiancee then precedes to toast us for finishing up with residency and the boards.  She then looks at me and adds, ""We would also like to toast you for your friendship over the past 3 years, we believe you have added a lot of love not only to us, but all you have met.""  My mouth preceded to hit the table and my eyes teared up.  It was a very special moment...one that I was not at all expecting.  It made me understand...I'm not sure what I now understand, but I understand.  Dinner was great and then I drove home. 

On the way home I began to reflect on the people I have met while here in Philly.  
Amazing people...who have taught me more than I ever dreamed possible.  Many things have happened to me while I was here.  I learned that I am beautiful (yes, someone actually told me that), that there are people out there who are truly conquering their dark monsters, that true friends don't care...they just sit by and hold your hand, that love is unconditionable, that diversity is one of God's greatest gifts, and I am beginning to remember that I do deserve to be happy.  I still feel happy, not run around and jump on the couch like Tom Cruise happy, but nonetheless happy.  Maybe it's not happy, maybe I have some sort of peace, or maybe, just maybe I am beginning to understand."

<TD vAlign=top width=420><I>Dancing with the Stars</I> is a <STRONG>totally unique and original series</STRONG> that pairs a celebrity with a professional dance partner as they train and then compete in front of a studio audience in a televised dance competition. The pairs will be judged by a panel of experts and also by viewers at home, with one couple being eliminated each week. <BR><BR>At the end of each performance, judges will give each couple a score. At the end of the broadcast, viewers will be instructed on how to call in and cast their vote for their favorite couple. The highest scores (from the judges and the audience) will be combined. At the conclusion of next week's episode, one couple will be eliminated.<BR><BR><STRONG><FONT color=#009900><I>Dancing with the Stars</I> has broad appeal, offering viewers dazzling costumes, dancing, celebrity gossip, behind-the-scenes training and contemporary music performed by a live 15-piece band.</FONT></STRONG> The format has already been an international hit in several countries.<BR><BR><FONT color=#339999><STRONG>In addition to learning precise movements and maneuvering in extravagant costumes, the pairs must maintain their focus, grace and composure during extremely high-pressured competition.</STRONG></FONT> Will they remain compatible during the process? The couples have already embarked on intense training in preparation for the first live show. During the live shows, judges will give a score based on several factors, including technical execution. But the judges' scores alone do not decide a couple's fate. Viewers at home can call in and vote for their favorites.

<P class=story>A pair of storks that decided to nest on the middle of a German golf course were so keen to become parents that they stole balls from players and tried to hatch them. They took so many balls that one nest, on the fourth green, overflowed and they built a second at the seventh hole for their haul.</P><!--MPU STOPPED BY MEDIA -->
<P class=story>Although their chances of parenthood appeared remote, the birds were regarded as a biological sensation by German nature authorities. Breaking with tradition, they had decided to nest on the ground rather than on top of a chimney.</P>

<CENTER>Storks next to the golf course</CENTER></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P class=story>Curious crowds flocked to see them at Golf Park Krogaspe near Neumuenster and last week a conservation group asked the club's British owner, Chris Parker, if the storks could incubate an egg left abandoned after the parents were killed. The egg was successfully infiltrated among the balls the chick is expected to hatch next week to be looked after by its surrogate parents - nicknamed Storki and Staki. </P>
<P class=story>""I was happy to agree, especially if it stopped them stealing golf balls in the middle of play,"" said Mr Parker, 53.</P>
<P class=story>He has erected a barrier to protect the storks, which first took up residence two weeks ago. ""At first we tried to chase them away, as we feared that they might get hit by a golf ball, but they proved very stubborn - and less timid by the day.</P>
<P class=story>""We couldn't believe it when we saw the nest filled with stolen balls. We contacted the German Nature Preservation Association and at first they didn't believe us. When they came to see, there was a lot of excitement.""</P>
<P class=story>Georg Fiedler, of the association, said: ""Between 1894 and 1997 only 16 stork couples in the whole of Europe have been reported to have had nests on the ground.""</P>
<P class=story>Mr Fiedler, who has studied storks for 34 years, thinks that the birds might have lost their own nest, possibly to another pair. ""The breeding season lasts a short time,"" he said. ""I believe that, driven by a remarkable parental urge, they nested on the green and tried to hatch golf balls. They obviously feel they bear a sufficient resemblance to stork eggs even though they are only about half the size.""</P>
<P class=story>Mr Parker, a former golf professional in Britain who moved to Germany in 1989 for a teaching job, said that storks were frequent visitors to the club. ""They fly over the course and occasionally come down to feed as the grass is short and they can hunt their mice and frogs easier.</P>
<P class=story>""Two weeks ago these storks landed on the green and started building nests. They settled by the 200-metre mark on the driving range, a fairly remote area where they don't get disturbed.""</P>
<P class=story>The chance for the storks to adopt a chick came when three eggs were salvaged from a nest whose parent birds apparently flew into overhead electricity cables.</P>
<P class=story>Two artificially hatched eggs have already produced healthy birds and Mr Parker's storks are in loco parentis of the third. </P>
<P class=story>""We put the egg in their nest, right next to the golf balls,"" said Mr Fielder. ""The storks were watching carefully from a distance, then came back as we left and inspected the novelty with great caution. </P>
<P class=story>""I was worried that the birds might become irritated and damage the egg, but after a few minutes it was obvious that they had fully accepted it as their own. The offspring is due in about four days.""</P>
<P class=story>Should the egg hatch successfully, the storks are likely to stay at the golf course for up to nine weeks while they teach the fledgling to fly.</P>

<P>The one-year-old hippo calf christened Owen was found alone and dehydrated by wildlife rangers near the Indian Ocean. 
<P>He was placed in an enclosure at a wildlife sanctuary in the coastal city of Mombasa and befriended a male tortoise of a similar colour. 
<P>According to a park official, they sleep together, eat together and ""have

<P>""Since Owen arrived on the 27 December, the tortoise behaves like a mother to it,"" Haller Park tourism manager Pauline Kimoti told the BBC News website. 
<P>""The hippo follows the tortoise around and licks his face,"" she said. 
<P>The tortoise is named Mzee, which is Swahili for old man. 
<P>Ms Kimoti said that if the 300kg hippo continued to thrive then in the next few weeks they would allow the public to see the unlikely pair together before they are separated. 
<P>The sanctuary, which is on the site of a former cement factory, plans eventually to get the help of the Kenya Wildlife Service to place Owen with Cleo, a lonely female hippo in a separate enclosure. 
<P>This is the latest in a series of unusual bondings in the wild that have surprised and delighted zoologists in Kenya. </P>

<P>Instead of then attacking the defenceless calf, the lioness adopted the baby, protecting it from other predators, including a leopard. 
<P>Extraordinarily, the lioness still allowed the mother oryx occasionally to come and feed her calf before chasing her away. But the rule of the wild ultimately prevailed on Sunday when a male lion attacked and killed the baby oryx while the lioness was sleeping.

<P>The lioness would lie down to rest in the afternoon and its unlikely charge would curl up beside her. 
<P>Wildlife expert Vincent Kapeen said he thought the lioness spared the oryx ""because animals have a special instinct to care for the young"". 
<P>""What is baffling is why the relationship has lasted so long,"" he was quoted as saying. 
<P><B>Sad ending</B> 
<P>According to the AFP news agency, the sad end to the story came on Sunday when the lioness led the oryx to the river to drink. 
<P>Weakened by two weeks of looking after her adopted baby, she fell asleep, failing to notice a hungry male lion in the area. 
<P>The oryx was no more. Patrick Muriungi, a receptionist at Samburu Lodge, told AFP the lioness was grief-stricken when she awoke to realise what had happened. 
<P>""She was very angry. She went around the lion about 10 times roaring, and then the lioness disappeared,"" he was quoted as saying. 
<P>She has not been seen since.

"event","I am finally feeling a little better today.  Not quite so nauseous but still unable to eat without wanting to retch 30 minutes later.  I finished my list of the 50 things I want to do before I die last night and then realized it was about 57.  What happens when you do them all?  Is that it?
I heard some interesting stories about animals this morning and will try to find them and post them later.
I hate this weather!  It makes me want to curl up on the couch and read a good book or watch a movie and kinda sleep but still listen out of one ear.  Anyway, feeling a little silly and have lots to do tonight."

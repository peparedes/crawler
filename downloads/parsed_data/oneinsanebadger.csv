"event","OMG!! what a horrible hour ive just spent! my baby, my wittle kitty was missing!! i went outside to sun bath with my sister at 1 and the kitties came out and just explored the pool area well at 3 we came in and we thought everyone was back in so my rents and i went the store and out to eat and then at 7 we noticed no one had seen loki, so we searched and searched in the house and then moved out side in the rain and i was almost in tears as my parents were out in the rain looking, and i was standing out side shaking his food bowl and i saw him, loki come around the corner of the house like we were disturbing a nap of his. it took us 20 minutes once we found him to get him to come in, my poor baby all alone outside with rain and lightening, he hates the water so he hide under the stairs on our porch. hes alot smarter than we give him credit for, i think. he smells like dirt and hes been eating grass becuz no one was home to let him in when he came to the door scratching and meowing when it started raining, becuz we were at the store and i had forgotten to check that he was in when ash and i came in, my poor baby. but he seems hokay no scratches or stuff. my poor baby, id have been so very very upset if he hadn't been found. aww! hes sneezing i hope he doesn't have a cold, the poor baby. ohh hes so cute my little baby. well sides this dramatizing event, i woke up with blood on my pillow, appartently my ear is going to bleed for a while, and i can't pick out the dried blood until my ear appointment. very gross, hoping to go to amandas shin dig, but my ear hurts and i don't want to take loratabs at amandas. that could end badly or i could just pass out. later peeps im going to hug and squeeze my poor little baby. :("

"event","yes well interesting day i had, i was chilling in chemistry, bored as hell. very very very bored. have I put emphasis on the whole bored part? 
 hokay. so i was playing with my metal necklace, first mistake, then i lost control of my springy necklace and it went in my ear, far far into my ear. so after not screaming out in pain for some terrible minutes i put my finger in to find lots and lots of blood, went to the nurse, she tried to clean out my ear, but it was hopeless their was to much blood, so she called my mummsie and said i need to go to primed. yeap. went and they refused to see me and said  i need to go to the emerency room. wonderful, have I ever mentioned how i hate hospitals? i HATE hospitals. so went and they gave me this lil wrist  band with my name and stuff. went and saw the doctor, asnwered billions of questions. he checked it out and said i scratched my ear canal and punch a nice lil hole in my membrane. why me?!!??!?! lol, so he gave me loratabs. fun fun, and said i needed to go to tha ear doctor, IN MONTGOMERY!! ah!! so we drove in the worst possible driving weather, i mean we were doing 30 something on the interstate with our emergency lights flashing, crazy i tell ya. so made it there the hosiptal had called a head,so they knew the story and made us fill out hundreds of forms and then i saw tha doc. he examined my ear with this huge ass machine and said he couldn't tell what exactly i had done the clot of blood was infront of the membrane, and they couldn't clean it becuz my ear had been dramatized enuff. he doesn't think i have a hole in my membrane but diffently scratched some stuff, so he gave us prescribtions. went to walgreens. chilled, ate a big and tastey. very nice, still wearing my lil wrist band so i look like an escaped hospital patient, lol. got ear drops and more loratabs and now im home. can't do alot of work or harsh movement, like jumping, yea whatever. so that was my grand aventure. my ear doesn't hurt just the dry blood is annoying that i can't pick out for fear of 'dramatizing' the ear. NOTE: DO NOT PLAY WITH METAL OBJECTS NEAR YOUR EAR - IT CAN RESULT IN MUCH LONG DRAWN OUT AVENTURES WITH UNPLEASENT EAR PAIN. thank you for ur time."

<P>moo..</P>
<P>hokay enough odd pictures lets see those quotes eh?</P>
<P>Cup of tea, cup a tea, almost got shagged, cup of tea. Demon monks. Shoulda gone to Vegas. <BR>(thats for sarah)</P>
<P>Spike had a little trip to the vet, and now he doesn't chase the other puppies anymore. <BR></P>
<P>I feel just like Santa Claus except thinner and younger and female and well, Jewish. (willow pasing out gifts)</P>
<P>I'm not choosing between my girlfriend and my best friend. That's insane troll logic.&nbsp; (xander )</P>
<P>The fact that no one understands you doesn't make you an artist. <BR>--Unknown </P>
<P>and that would be plently of quotes hokay? hokay.</P>
<P>any waz to actually use this silly journal-</P>
<P>love. werid word. its not even cool enough to spell something backwards ( evol? wtf ) and besides that odd factor its one sylabal- and thats boring. so why does it matter so bloody much? i believe one of the hardest things for people (real people with feelings not robots that look like people) is to admit they love. some poeple are open hearted and foolish (meaning they love some one with a different name everyweek) others are close hearted (meaning they don't love.) lol im sure there are many other catorgories. but the main thing about love i know for sure is this: if its real- not just that once in a life time love of your bleedin life thing- but real love- then it will last forever. i dunno how to differ between in love and love. theres a difference for sure. i think you fall in love only once (well only really once) and thats supose to be the love of your bleedin life. but as for the other love. just love. its so painful at times. not only admittitn you love someone but having to watch them hurt, or struggle in life, or do something beyond stupid, or simply just to hurt them. a nother big difference between love is brotherly and passionately. or sexually to replace passionately. lol ofcourse im a teen. everything is passionate at this age. your feelings towards the opposite or same sex and your emotions run high when your pissed- easily senstive. another hard love to differ between the brotherly and passionately one. becuz the teen age is so passionate its hard to tell if u simply&nbsp;just want some one in lust or if theres just some underlining love that is meant to help in times of need. ofcourse this is all mumbled and rumbled in minds this may maynot make sense but for those who catch the drift what may shock you is this: theres an answer. thers really an answer to all of it. a way to tell. and its not jesus christ. lol sorry had to throw that one in, actually for some that may be an answer but they wear black and white and don't often get to have sex. sucks. but the other answer is simple. time. only time can show. ofcourse thats simple and dandy untill you throw in the ultimate factor. lifes short. it truely is. we'lll look on our death bed and go....shit im bout to end it all. or shit..im going numb..or hey even maybe a shit...i never got laid. so with all this going on through ur brain or right pass it. which ever one. i simply write this becuz its doing to me what it might be doing to you. running through my mind and making several laps and drinking gateraid. blue gateraid to be specific. anyways becuz time is the answer and time can only last for soo long. i say live life. live it in a way that when your in bed alone or happy snuggled next to some one, you won't look back and go shit....that was gay. which if we could all do that id say life would be much much much easier for the whole population. anyway another mind jogging thing- is reading romance novels really good? i mean does that help you clarify love? becuz i think those novels aren't trash exactly but jeez everyones happy and there areno probs and the hottest guy gets the hottest girl . real lifes not like that. sooo reading these novel might actually give a fake image of love to girls (or guys) in which when love reachs them they might reject it- becuz it wasn't what they read. just a though, another being...would i look good with bangs? just a thought cuz im bored of my hair. im not choping it off again, but its kinda dull and i hardly brush it anyways...and a hairstyle that requires no effort would be nice. hokay.. i think im done for the day....oh! dreams..another though..perhaps not all dreams are meant to be forfilled.. but its dreams that keep you going and give you something to work towards and maybe when you hit that road that splits..forfilling your dream or helping some one else....you'll really have shown love when u picked the right side of the split and gave up your dreams for some one else. </P>
<P>i love you mark! and my peeps.</P>

(funny word vagina spelt funny too.) and i recall club pictures... and a busy history that included monty python quotes. fun fun. oh yea for band i got to play on an eupheum (can't spell it but ya know the mini tuba) that requires alot of air- wow. im soo tired and i feel kinda sick (snots all in my stomach right now and i look like crap and my hairs all messy and my bright blue shirt and gray striped pants and pale blue slippers (that light up with moons and stars is very interesting..) so yea just picture taht when u try to sleep... won't be very pretty.

The only one I that have ever known
Don't know were it goes
But its home and I walk alone 

I walk this empty street
On the Blvd. of broken dreams
Were the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

My shadows the only one that walks beside me
My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find
Till then I'll walk alone

Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ahhh

That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge
And were I walk alone

Read between the lines of what's
Fucked up and every things all right
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone

I walk alone

Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.

my wedding song!

When it's love you give 
(I'll be a man of good faith.) 
then in love you live. 
(I'll make a stand. I won't break.) 
I'll be the rock you can build on, 
be there when you're old, 
to have and to hold. 

When there's love inside 
(I swear I'll always be strong.) 
then there's a reason why. 
(I'll prove to you we belong.) 
I'll be the one that protects you 
from the wind and the rain, 
from the hurt and pain. 
Let's make it all for one and all for love. 
Let the one you hold be the one you want, 
the one you need, 
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all. 
When there's someone that should know 
then just let your feelings show 
and make it all for one and all for love. 

When it's love you make 
(I'll be the fire in your night.) 
then it's love you take. 
(I will defend, I will fight.) 
I'll be there when you need me. 
When honor's at stake, 
this vow I will make: 
that it's all for one and all for love. 
Let the one you hold be the one you want, 
the one you need, 
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all. 
When there's someone that should know 
then just let your feelings show 
and make it all for one and all for love. 

Don't lay our love to rest 
'cause we could stand up to you test. 
We got everything and more than we had planned, 
more than the rivers that run the land. 
We've got it all in our hands. 
Now it's all for one and all for love. 
(It's all for love.) 
Let the one you hold be the one you want, 
the one you need, 
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all. 
(It's one for all.) 
When there's someone that should know 
then just let your feelings show. 
When there's someone that you want, 
when there's someone that you need 
let's make it all, all for one and all for love. 

yea its off the three muskteers. yea well i feel sappy but i don't think ill die....?"

"event","if i could tell the world one thing, it would be were all ok. and not to worry becuase worrying is wasteful in times like these. - jewel.

well today was one if those weird days. but anyways ive been thinking, of course bout the future (always a fun thing to do) ok so ive always known i was going to college - more specificly - Auburn (hell yes!) because my parents have told me this. however ive been loking at careers that fasinate me and my dreams that all kids have (ya know the boys dream of being fire fighters and the girls wanna be nurses yea whatever) well none of those rewire college. my sister is at auburn right now and its soaking up alot of my parents money, so my parents really want me to get a scholarship for a college (any college i just wanna go to auburn) so im taking all those fun yet not really just really hard classes like ap history (cuz if in may i pass the test i get a college credit which means one less class my parents have to pay for) yet what has this all have to do with my dreams and shit? not everyone was born to achieve all their dreams, but what use is wondering in life knowing u never accomplished ur only dreams? ofcourse dreams change, mine have but not all. there is that other way of looking at life - ur dreams only mattered as a child to give u the inspiration to do what ur meant to do - become another citzen with a job that pays for the house, and bills. wow. i wanna go to college - i have this crazy idea of going to auburn like my dad and living with my best friend in a trailer with my cat, loki. (my dad and his best friend allen (whose my god father) lived in a trailer at auburn with a bunch of cats they named funnny things) i dunno why im rambling on about this really, none of my friends intend on going to auburn, and  most people say u never see high school friends after high school (yea whatever) im truely afraid of the future becuase i don't wanna wake up and realize im living in a crappy apartment with some random guy i married after college and my job is a paper pusher. that would be aweful. i truely wanna live some where else if not in alabama then in ireland, france, germany, swizterland, solvania, i don't care just some where. again i am rambling, then again this is a sort of journal for thoughts. i thought of how i could be sweet, organized, and etc(everything im not basicly). and realized thats not my nature, i really want a friend like that to balance me out. i think im better at best friend instead of group of friends yet i have a group of friends (which no offense are great but there are flaws within everything) theres so many comflicting thoughts running through my head i swear i could write an album by now with everything thats going on (it won't be a great album especically if im singing the songs) i don't believe ive been through everything in life but i feel ive had my dose of the good and bad things . ive been through a phrase of poems, writing songs, bible hugger, hiker, rock climbing, played soft ball, did gymastics, in band still, ive had my childhood memories some peasent other not, my dads been to war, my family closet is packed with horrors, ive been through death in the family, ive been in the depresso stage of life, yea cut myself, tried to overdose, was antorixa (dropped to 75 pounds) i use to help out my mom with the red cross, book nerd, still a scif loser,  cop trouble (gotten friend arrested for me roof surfing) use to have a horse (two actually the horse gave birth) been to, too many countries to list. have pregnaut friends, drugie friends, ive been in an accident that nearly costed me my life, ive had a dog, cat, bird, bunny, etc, ive been in a one year relationship, ive (thought) i really had found love once only to be dumped days later, drawing, yes ive even won at trivia pursuit before(it was the starwars version) ive snuck out of houses etc etc etc etc. yes there are things ive not been through in life. but i feel ive been through alot (as many teens my age have been through and feeel like) my history is as colorful as anyone else if not duller. i try so hard never to feel like i am to different from any one, my life shoudln't be any different than yours, but no matter how u look at this i feel ive been through enough. im tired of secrets i tired of wondering who i should be, what my future could be, why my past was what it was. even the god issue im tired of. (yes i believe there is a god whom created me, and loves me and listens to me, and protects me. and i love him. no i don't read the bible. no i don't pray everyday.) so as anyone who is still reading this ive jumped around topics alot. lol. wow im number than i was when i first started writing this. no one knows what the future will hold. u can't change ur past, but u can re live it if ur not careful. the present should never be ignored. learn to live life to its fullest. keep short lists, and forgive easily, life will go by quicker than u think. (another big fear of mine is knowing im dying and looking back on my life and realizing that half my life i spent mad, being overly senstive and shit. the other one is still fallingin love, thats a scary thing because u give a guy control over ur heart which controls alot of you) 

you can tell 
from the scars on my arms 
and cracks in my hips 
and the dents in my car
and the blisters on my lips
that i'm not the carefullest of girls
you can tell 
from the glass on the floor
and the strings that're breaking 
and i keep on breaking more 
and it looks like i am shaking 
but it's just the temperature
and then again 
if it were any colder i could disengage 
if i were any older i could act my age
but i dont think that youd believe me
it's
not 
the 
way 
i'm
meant
to 
be 
it's just the way the operation made me
and you can tell 
from the state of my room 
that they let me out too soon 
and the pills that i ate 
came a couple years too late 
and ive got some issues to work through
there i go again 
pretending to be you
make-believing 
that i have a soul beneath the surface 
trying to convince you
it was accidentally on purpose 
i am not so serious 
this passion is a plagiarism 
i might join your century 
but only on a rare occasion
i was taken out 
before the labor pains set in and now
behold the world's worst accident
i am the girl anachronism
and you can tell
by the red in my eyes 
and the bruises on my thighs 
and the knots in my hair 
and the bathtub full of flies 
that i'm not right now at all
there i go again 
pretending that i'll fall 
don't call the doctors 
cause they've seen it all before 
they'll say just 
let 
her 
crash 
and 
burn 
she'll learn 
the attention just encourages her
and you can tell 
from the full-body cast 
that i'm sorry that i asked 
though you did everything you could 
(like any decent person would)
but i might be catching so don't touch
you'll start believeing youre immune to gravity and stuff 
don't get me wet 
because the bandages will all come off
and you can tell
from the smoke at the stake 
that the current state is critical
well it is the little things, for instance:
in the time it takes to break it she can make up ten excuses:
please excuse her for the day, its just the way the medication makes her...
i dont necessarily believe there is a cure for this 
so i might join your century but only as a doubtful guest 
i was too precarious removed as a caesarian 
behold the worlds worst accident 
I AM THE GIRL ANACHRONISM"

"event","well its 7:30 and i am not at school, becuase im bout to leaave for a funeral. my great aunt died tuesday. i knew her ofcourse, saw her twice a year once at christmas and thanksgiving. But that was it, no going to the fair together or any real closeness. i don't like funerals. so sad, and it always rains. which seem to add to the gloom, even though i like rain. i wish we could celebrate the dead, becuase hopefully their going to a better place. but if it was my sister or grandma i wouldn't be able to celebrate, so i guess it would be wrong to expect others to celebrate those close to them being dead. i haven't been to a funeral since my great grandfather died. that was my grandma and my great aunts dad. well nothing really to say, cept i hope everyone has a great day, and no condolencents needed, i am not terribly sad, but i am sad for my grandma, it was her sister."

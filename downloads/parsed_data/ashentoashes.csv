With time i think anything can be overlooked. and Im sure soon enough i wont feel the desire to even hold the slightest grudge and maybe that makes me the weak person. i guess that somtimes completely starting over is the right way to move past somthing, but still never forgetting. i learned alot and yeah think ill about you when things remind me of you and miss different things, and its easy to say you wont do the same but to believe you wont, your crazy.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><font size=""1"" color=""#c0c0c0""><b><br /><br /></b>so please understand this isnt just goodbye, <i>this is.. i cant stand...</i></font>"

-saw some cool crap, that place r000lz sk00lz.

/outline


in more detail...

we went to pcj to see who all was there and shit, around 930 i guess. hilary and her crew including travos were still there and they were all like: 
<u>dialog!!</u>
""sup?"" and we were like ""nothing"" and they were like ""wanna shoot off legal fire works"" and we were like ""sure"" and they were like ""sweet"" and we were like ""bitchin"" and they were like ""lets go to mcdonalds, sheetz, and then Laurens"" and we were like ""OK""
/dialog

we ended up at laurens having some extreme snapper cracker fire works that you have to light, and throwing them at each other. fun fun. i had the bright idea to see what it would look like inside a shoe, of course my shoe... inwhich for 3 seconds was on fire... its still wearable though, just pretty haggard, but i dont care much. 

peeps left, and we sat around. travis, ed, lauren, hilary, and i chatted a while, about other peeps, life in general, and other humorous things, nothing important, teasing insued but no feelings were hurt just laughs. we left, hung at travis's till like 2, left. i came home.

I planned on getting on my COMP and check the myspace, livejournal and going to bed. though my computer decieded to take a shit on my parade and not work. i called dell at 230 to resolve the problem i thought would take, eh 30 minutes. ended up taking 2 hours and 30 minutes. i was on the phone with a nice indian gentlmen for 2 hours and 30 minutes. I kept cracking jokes forgetting that he probably wouldnt get them, but he was a good sport. He told me his name was Eugine, but CHYEA likely story, thats way to american for him. BUT it got fixed, so cool thing. after that, i really didnt seem tired. which led to

<u>Right Now</u>
I'm sippin my juice, listening to blink182, and waiting for lizzy to wake up in about an hour to get ready for work and talk to my fine ass for a little bit. Shes gonna be suprised i did this and hopfully proud of me. she will be no doubt. Lots of her this weekend. a deffenate good thing. most deffently. saturday right after she gets off work I am picking her up and we are gonna go to a rock showwwwwww. dancing of all kinds will occure and it will be a good night. she is staying with me which always helps me sleep better. and then sunday, we will probably go to goodwill, find good bargins and all that jazz. shes always more sucessful there then i am. I am also really glad she has stuck with me. when saying that i mean.. well she doesnt hate me, and still enjoys my presence for some reason, hah. Because, well i love the girl, and Shes stuck with me longer then any other girl ever has... and possibly ever will hehe. I'd like to keep her around... for well ever. Shes great to me. And I'll admit it right now journal, I'd be lying if said being with her isnt what i want most right now. But im realizing that letting things happen insted of forcing what i want works sooo much better. I'v looked at these past 2 weeks and wish that i would have done that from the start. I'm not exactly sure what she wants right now, which is good. but any other time i would be freaking not knowing whats going on because well i think im a control freak. but somtimes its best not to know whats going on and maybe, JUST MAYBE ill be plesently suprised. But as of right now, Im still pretty darn lucky. Life could be worse, could be better at times but i dont have much to complain about. This girl cares about me. I mean dont get me wrong so do my parents and my awesome friends and all that, but not in this way. Liz really cares about me more then well alot of things! i think thats pretty cool. Im a jealous boy. I admit this to journal, Im scaaaaaaared. i really am. not of her just dropping me, because i know she wont. But this being self concious thing is sooooo unfimilar to me.. im not use to it i guess. blah blah, but i just have a feeling everything is gonna work out.. as long as i just keep being myself dammit. God it feels so weird to feel like iv been somone totally different in the same skin, i didnt notice at the time but now i do and dont like it one bit. 
/right now

I've had breaks for singing, peeing, sippin koolaid. but i seriously will give anyone who reads this whole thing 10 dollars. But im all out of things to say... so until the next all nighter or if i just feel somthing is intresting enough to update about it... i will aaaaaa update... about it. cool?"

"event","<u>today:</u>

w/ Liz
-funeral:[
-goodwilled in thurmont
-downtown frederick
-ate really great food
-goodwilled in frederick
-baker park


so i decided to update.
Because I think this is something deffently worth updating about.
no its not stupid high school drama, or about some super sweet car.
basicly, Reality.
There was a death in Liz's family a few days ago (its very personal so for her sake I dont wanna over step my boundries) and I attended the funeral with her. It was rough, for me and her both. I've never been one to show my emotion real well. I can express my feelings towards something easily.. maybe TO easily. hah. but showing my emotion is different, to me anyway. Until right now, maybe Liz didnt noticed that I took this harder then it may have looked like I did, But I think she did because she reads me like a book. 

But what really hit hard was the idea of life. and the many influences in life itself. 

As the minister spoke today one thing that stuck in my mind was the idea of knowing some one.   .. and how well can you really know someones life until you know your own and are so postive thats how you want it be. Because your perceived a thousand different ways by thousands of different people that you come in contact with in you every day life. Whether if its when you were young or when you get old, you are in a way an influence to those people. But how is it that you wanna influence others? and in that.. in my opinion.. is who you are. The few times I was able to come in contact with liz's grandmother, I got the feeling of an extreme comfort in her home. The first time I meet somone new.. I get the normal awkward feeling everyone gets, Though in this case, meeting liz's grandma for the first time, it was an extreme welcoming feeling as if i had been there many times before. I never really spoke to anyone about this.. not even liz because well i dont describe how i percieve every person i come in contact with. But I think she can tell when I'm comfortable, and i bet she noticed it way back then. Though the reason I feel the need to describe this case is because as i sat in the funeral room, nearly squeezing liz's hand i heard so many people say the same thing i had thought and felt 11 months before. That was what put everything in perspective for me. I'm not gonna preach and talk about whose belife is right, Because for everyone its different, thus having different ways of thinking.

a kinda weird/satisfying thing about this is that a few days ago Liz told me what an influence she played in her life, and many others that had been apart of her grandmas life. Though at the time I had no idea it would amount to this, and how somone i just met a few times could influence me in such ways as she did people that knew her for years.

Dont take this the wrong way though, I'm not claiming that I was super close with her like liz was, because i wasnt. or knew her super well like liz did, because i didnt. the basic point of this is how someone can influence those close, not so close, or heck peoples lives who never met them in very similar ways. I know its all confusing and well i guess you can read this and think im totally wrong.

but anyway, I'm glad I could be there for Liz today and through out this process for that matter. I'm glad she knows that she can come to me in times of need. I hate to see her hurt like she has been. I dont need to date the girl to know that I Love Her. Tho i dont know exactly what shes going through.. I can see the hurt in her and the tears made it apparent. Its funny how something as little as whipping the tears from her eyes is so powerfull... to me anyway.
Regaurdless of what happens between me and her, I can honestly say I have never been so close to some one in my life and when im not being selfish i relize how lucky i am to have her. We're gonna be there for each other through thick and thin. yeah arguments will come, but they'll also go, only making our relationship/friendship stronger.
Shes a beatiful girl, not just on the outside. but deffently on the inside also. hah I know I've probably told her that a million times."

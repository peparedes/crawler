"event","I feel like a string that has been pulled as tight as it can go and is then released. I'm flying through the air. 

I've come out of the Ivan mess to find myself in love with everyone and no one. It's strange to stop lying to myself and to see what I really think and feel. And then I feel like shouting it to the world, but being too honest to everyone can be damaging. Suffice it to say I hate/love you.

Wow. Life with open eyes is scary/beautiful/fast/sad/bright/lonely.

It's so hard to not want to be tied down again."

"event","I love it in my new neighborhood. I've never been so excited to live somewhere. I wake up, look outside, and there's Brooklyn. There's a restaurant/cafe/bar under my apartment, a park across the street, and an elementary school and a police station across the park.  There's a tortilla factory where one can buy 2 pounds of delicious tortillas for a dollar. From the roof, I can see the city in its concentrated, metropolitan glory.  And there are the artsy cafes.. and the artist lofts... and it's just lovely.
views from my window:

the restaurant sign

the ""other"" bar across the street (word is there are some rednecks here in brooklyn and they all go there for some reason)

the park. that huge building is the elementary school (the bartender downstairs says the teachers all come in and get drunk on Fridays)

and more of the park.

Ivan is in L.A. this week for his spring break. I'm bored as hell."

"event","College is a disappointment.  I feel like its another middle stone to something that's supposed to be better, more rigorous, more mature. What if the Duke House is a disappoinment too?

On a much happier note, Smadar is here in NY with me.  We went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art today and it was marvelous.  And last night, I took her to a bar.  Well, I live above a bar/restaurant (http://www.lifecafenyc.com/page2.html) and Ivan was playing at their open mic night... but I got Smadar to go to a bar!

And Jasmine will be here on monday! Yay!
I love having people visit me. So if any of ya'll have the airfare, I would love to see you! Free accomodations/tour guide! 

I'm just lonely."

"event","Today, I reminisced with Diana about the Los Angeles freeway system after seeing Harry Potter at Times Square. And yes, I cried during the movie. What can I say.

I don't know why I find randomness to be the ideal form of all interactions and occurrences. I suppose it's the allure of life that doesn't seem so scripted. And this is why I miss strawberries on the beach and ice cream in the park. This is also why I never had many playdates. I love to get up and go with a get-up-and-go person to delve in haphazard joy. 

Too bad I haven't found any such people in New York.

It's wonderful that I'll be back in LA soon."

"event","I feel disconnected. 

I miss Los Angeles and ""the Life."" Despite my philosophy on moving forward, I have so many regrets. I hate my failed relationships. I hate past awkwardness. Yes, it is cliche, but I want to move forward by looking back.

Connect?

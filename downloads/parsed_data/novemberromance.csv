<lj-cut text=""I like this song"">

The rain, it started tapping on the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming,so I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open. Just my nightstand and my dresser where those nightmares had just been.
So I dressed myself and left then, out into the gray streets.
But everything seemed different and completely new to me.
The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body.
And each person I encountered, I couldn't wait to meet.
I came up a doctor who appeared in quite poor health.
I said ""(I am terribly sorry but) there is nothing I can do for you (that) you can't do for yourself.""
He said ""Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand. I think that would help.""So I sat with him a while and then I asked him how he felt. He said, ""I think I'm cured. No, in fact, I'm sure of it.
Thank you Stranger, for your therapeutic smile.""So that is how I learned the lesson that <strong>everyone is alone</strong>.
<strong>And your eyes must do some raining if you are ever going to grow.</strong> But when crying don't help and you can't compose yourself. It is best to compose a poem, an honest verse of longing or simple song of hope.
That is why I'm singing... Baby don't worry cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying,I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad,then we will wait for it to pass and I will keep you company through those days so long and black.
And we'll just keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve of Love's uneven remainders,our lives are fractions of a whole.But if the world could remain in a frame like a painting on a wall.Then I think we would see the beauty.
Then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges,like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.

<P><lj-cut text=""Its not hard to dream""> </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Konstantine</P>
<P>I can't imagine all the people that you know<BR>And the places that you go<BR>When the lights are turned down low<BR>And I don't understand<BR>All the things you've seen<BR>But I'm slipping in between<BR>You and your <FONT size=5>big</FONT>... dreams<BR>it's <U>always</U> you and my big dreams</P>
<P>And you tell me<BR>That it's over<BR>But i can't stand here in a patch of four leaf clover<BR>And your restless<BR>And I'm naked<BR>You've got to get out<BR>You can't stand to see me shaking<BR>no, would you let me go</P>
<P>and you don't want to be here in the future<BR>So you say<BR>the present's just a pleasant<BR>Interruption to the past<BR>And you don't want to look much closer<BR>'Cause you're afraid to find out all the hope<BR>That you had sent into the sky by now had... crashed<BR>and it did because of me</P>
<P>And then you bring me home<BR>Afraid to find out that you're alone, no<BR>And I'm sleeping in your living room<BR>But we don't have much room<BR>To live</P>
<P>And I had dreams that i would learn to play guitar<BR>Maybe cross the country<BR>Become a rockstar<BR>And there was hope in me<BR>That I could take you there<BR>But dammit you're so young<BR>But I don't think I care<BR>and if I hurt you then i'm sorry<BR>It's just this guilt has got the best of me</P>
<P>And then you bring me home<BR>'Cause we both know what its like to be alone, no<BR>And I'm dreaming in your living room<BR>But we don't have much room<BR>To live</P>
<P>Konstantine came walking down the stairs<BR>Doesn't she look good<BR>Standing in her underwear?<BR>And i've been thinking, and i've thinking, no<BR>But she's been drinking<BR>And it doesn't get me anywhere</P>
<P>My Konstantine came walking down the stairs<BR>And all that I could do<BR>Was touch her long blond hair<BR>And i was thinking, what i was thining ya know<BR>we've been drinking and it doesn't get me anywhere</P>
<P>This is because I can spell konfusion with a K<BR>It's hard to like it<BR>It's to dying in anothers arms<BR>and why i had to try it<BR>It's to jimmy eat world<BR>and those nights in my car<BR>But this time i'm alone, and i don't see those stars<BR>I'm not your star?<BR>Isn't that what you said<BR>what you thought this song meant<BR>you thought this song meant</P>
<P>And if this is what it takes<BR>just to lie in my mistakes<BR>and live with what I did to you<BR>And all the things i put you through<BR>I always catch the clock it's 11:11<BR>And now you want to talk<BR>it's not hard to dream<BR>You'll always be my Konstantine</P>
<P>They'll never hurt you like I do<BR>No, They'll never hurt you like I do<BR>No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No</P>
<P>This is to a girl who got into my head<BR>with all these pretty things she did<BR>Hey Baby, You know that you keep me up in bed<BR>It's to a girl who got into my head<BR>with all the fucked up things I did<BR>Hey Maybe Baby, You could keep me up in bed<BR>My Konstantine</P>
<P>Spin Around me like a Dream<BR>We played out on this movie screen<BR>And i said, did you know I missed you<BR>Did you know I missed you<BR>Did you know I missed you<BR>Did you know I missed you<BR>Did You know i miss you<BR>Did you know i miss you<BR>Did you know i miss you</P>
<P>God, I miss you</P>
<P>And then you bring me home<BR>And we'll go to sleep but this time not alone, no no,<BR>And you'll kiss me in your living room, oh<BR>And you see, no, that i've been missing in my Living room<BR>Cause this is what i miss, what i miss<BR>We don't have much room<BR>I said, does anyboy need that room? <BR>Because we all need a little more room<BR>To live</P>

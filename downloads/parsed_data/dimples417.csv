So many fun people to hang out with! Especially the guys.  When I want to have a good time, and get away from problems around here, I GO TO EASTERN! They always let me have a good time.

Today, I sat there and watched them play poker, because obviously I don't know how too. Natalie doesn't either, and that was what my entertainment for the night was! Lol..right Nat Cat?? Anyways, I got to see Tony again today. That boy is THE coolest guy I have ever met in my life!! I wish he was online right now so that I could talk to him..lol cuz it would be fun. Him, Natalie, and I were spooning on the couch! Lol that was lots of fun too! Just cuz it was very comfortable!  We also did card tricks! I finally got to pull mine off! HECK YES! 

Well I guess I'm off to bed now because I have school in the morning and I'm extremly tired! Write more later!!

"event","<P>Today was so much fun! I want to thank a couple of people for that..Natalie, Cassie, Tony, Drew, Travis..and that one girl..I didn't catch her name!</P>
<P>I went up to Eastern today with Cassie to have a little bit of fun, and we had soo much fun!! We met Tony and Drew, and they were totally cool.&nbsp; Something about Tony though, he caught my eye! So we went to the mall, but on the way there, WE GOT LOST! But thankfully Drew was from around there and he got us there safely! When we got there, I got into a fight with this guy from FYE. He was soo mean, so I thought I would stick up for my friends and get back in his face after he got in mine! But anyways, we didn't have that much money, so we decided to leave and grab some McDonalds!</P>
<P>When we got back ,we just decided to sit around and hang out! I have never had that much fun just sitting around and talking. That's when we met Travis. I can't wait to go back up there again to see all of them. I hope that I can stay in touch with them when Im here at home. I'm thinking about going up there for school next year. That would be extra cool!! Welp, I guess Im done here! Im gonna go eat some cookies and wait for Nat Cat to call me back!! xoxo to everyone!!!</P>


**Have you ever met someone, and it just seemed so different than everyone else you meet? You get this feeling inside of you that makes you smile? What about everytime you look at that person and you just can't seem to look away? That's how I felt today with someone!! It was the strangest feeling to overcome me, but if I could do it all again, I would in a heartbeat.**"

Well, I'm going up to Eastern today, and I guess according to Natalie, we are supposed to go on like a triple date thing...so we will see how that works out..even though I don't know why any guy would want to meet me..I would probably just scare them off. Who knows :-/ I have to go get ready for the day, and then we are off to Eastern. I'm going to try and find a way to have myself a good time and not worry about things here back at home!

I heard that the girls swim team won..so Good Job Ladies, keep it up!!

We went to Burger King afterwards, and their computers were down, so it was kind of slow, but good thing I have a lot of patience because I would have left! I scarfed my food down, and I think when I burped afterwards, I shook the whole place!!

So I don't know what to do. I think I like him, but I don't know...He only wants to be friends, but then again I don't know if he likes me more than that, because I haven't asked him!! I don't know what to do. If you think you could help me out, IM me on Dimples2305

And I almost broke my arm and toe! Yesterday would have been more fun if SOMEONE would have called..He knows who he is, and he knows that it was his fault he didn't call! But oh well...

We went to the football game and it was fun because Jenny was trying so hard to get the wrapper off her starburst with her mouth, and when she finally did it, she wanted to be timed! I was excited for Gabe because he played a lot! And the best part about the whole game, VON PAGELS WAS IN THE COUGAR WITH COWBOY BOOTS! It looked sooo funny..CLASSIC..wish I had my camera then.

"event","Thats right, I said it, another day in the bag.  Good thing I finally got the Monday over with. Now I can get on peacefully with the rest of the week. I hate Mondays! I have a bad case of the Mondays!! Lol..Anyways, not much happened today, I slept a lot after school because I had nothing to do!!

I'm supposed to hang out with John Skinner tomorrow. That should be fun, and then I'm supposed to go the game with Dave Hatcher!! It's going to be a lot of fun!! Well sorry that this update isn't much, but I don't really have anything exciting going on in my life right now!! We got homecoming pictures today, and I think they look good even though Gabriel doesn't think so! Whatever to him!!

Welp, my friends are getting ready to leave, so I have to go get ready for beddy!! Leave some comments please! :-D

Hope to meet Dave's friend Ryan soon!!"

"event","The only reason I say Oh No in the title is because I JUST RAN OUT OF SCOOBY DOO FRUIT SNACKS!! Thats alright, there are plenty more upstairs!!

So I don't really know what to say in this update, there wasn't much excitment today.  I think that I'm going to give up on him...He would never like me.  Since I'm going to give up, I think I will work up the courage to put his name in here. His name is..............Paul....anyways, I have to get going. Please leave messages if you feel like you need too!! :-D


Write more later!! :) See ya on the flip side!! hehe"

"event","Last night was boring, but then again crazy. We were so bored that we just drove around for about an hour...Everyone was off doing something of their own.  Cassie and I decided to go back to her house and just make some food, and then go and jump on the trampoline!! It was so much fun because we were both jumping at the same time, and somehow she ended up jumping towards me and hitting me.. we both crashed to the bottom. Good thing we didn't get hurt, but that had to be the funniest thing that happened all night!!  It was nice just to spend some time with my best bud!

Anyways, I was SO tempted to call *him* last night to see if he wanted to hang out, but I chickened out. I think that I just need to move on because I know that he would never like me!! He definately knows who he is...But I think it's my time to go now!! I have to finish up some homework! Leave messages please!!"

"event","What a day!! I had school, but that wasn't bad at all because it was Friday! I came home and spent some time with Bryan because I haven't done that in a long time!! It's nice to spend time with my brother, because there really isn't much time to do that.

I went to the football game with Cassie, Jessy, Heather, and Jenny D. It was so much fun just hangin out with the girls! Anyways, we were gettin' the crap kicked out of us, so we decided to leave at half time! The score was like 60-8 when we left, and we weren't winning...It kinda sucked. But Cassie, Heather, and I went to the dollar show and saw The Notebook again. Even though I have seen that movie before, it never fails to make me cry. It is so sad..and at the same time, it makes me think. I wish that I could find a true love like that. It makes me think about how the love I once had, was never even love at all. It seemed so petty and childish, like I don't even know what love is anymore.

Once again, I wish that I could have *him*. I had a dream last night that he asked me to go out with him. Of course I woke up happy, but then as I really woke up, I came to realize that that would never happen.  You know, one day I will work up the courage to actually put his name in here. Maybe that day, he will see it, if he even reads this, and he might just MIGHT change his mind about me. But I don't think that would ever happen. Well I think I'm going to go to bed now. If you think you might have a clue on my situation and want to help...I would love to read your comments. So please leave them!!"

"event","This title fits my emotions so perfectly right now. I have this feeling of loneliness that keeps haunting me. I look around and everyone has someone. NOT ME! It sucks being like almost the only one without that special someone. When am I going to find someone for me? Or at least find a guy that likes me when I like him. I pose these questions to myself, but never do I seize to find the answers. If you think you know the answers, then please comment..but if they are bad, I don't feel like hearing them. That's the last thing I need right now is hearing something horibble. Well I guess that Im going to get going....Please leave me NICE comments in here! I need some cheering up!!"

It's nice, but I wish I could go to school because I already have 2 days, and 3 in my Teach Read class.

But I doubt that would happen, and even if he did...he wouldn't know I exsist! I'll be back for more!!"

"event","obsessng again....I wish I could control my mind..letting people who don't know I exist effect me to the point of madness..Their going to be the end of me and they don't even know it. Mental ward patient # 2469, here I come.

I can't wait to get a regular job and school starts so I can distract myself from my mind and find some kind of sanity. Focus my mind completely on college and my job.

DAVE MATTHEWS THIS SUNDAY! 

I went to Sav-on to pick up my Grad Night photos finally..Some really good photos w/ Madie, Emily, Jennifer, Andy, and more..plus a few from the day after of Cyn and I. Put them into my photo album..it's almost full..time for another!

Then drove by Cyn's place to get my cell phone but she's still asleep..so I some how ended up at the mall..went looking around in Nordstroms and Victoria's Secret. Had no money so I couldn't buy anything..so I left and went home. 

Oh, and reading my book, The Truth About Cats and Dogs.

Then went w/ Sean to In&out w/ her sister Lauren,her friend Vanessa, and my brother, Sean. Now just listening and singing to music, will continue to do that!"

"event","well Today....
<lj-cut>
I woke up and my dad said we were going to North Hollywood. So I got ready to go. I had to drive with Janell and Dad in the backseat....It's weird and I don't like that I have to sit there. I'm used to sitting up front....my dad and I but I have to let go..which is going to take sometime. I really like Janell....it's just I miss my dad. I love that my dad is so happy.

We went to a pet shop to check out puppies(cockapoos)....they were so cute! There was this one puppy who wasn't really playing so I picked it up and set it in my lap. I petted and gave the puppy attention....after awhile it warmed up to me it started to play and bite. It always came to me and sit in my lap and give me kisses. I always go for the runts when it comes to puppies. They need to be loved and taken care of and I want to do that for them. I guess I named it baby b/c I kept calling the puppy that. I got attached to another animal that I won't be able to have....it's very disappointing. Janell and Dad still want to look some more....it's as if were buying a car....I just want a puppy!

-went to Bob's Big Boy to eat..we sat outside..flies and bees..yeah. 
-Drove to Grandmas House....almost killed us....hearing the sound of my father's angry tone..parked. 
-Went to Susan's across the street to see Harrison and the baby. I took a few pics....then my Grandma and I said good bye. 
-Then went to the house....Dad gave me a hug..driving w/Janell to calm my nerves. 
-Drove to Vons to get her cig.'s, caught a guy checking me out..it was weird..he was cute but young and to the pet shop where there was only big dogs. 
-Took Grandma driving and saw Bill's nephew....older attractive man
-I kissed my grandma good-bye and told I'd see her soon. 
-We drove home and I fell asleep. I woke up in the car..got out of the car..walked upstairs..fell on to my bed and back to sleep. 
-Read....television....Comedy Central..Some Kind of Wonderful..DINNER TIME! Salmon..shrimp..broccoli..rolls..red wine. -Dateline..degrassi..Daria....read....sleepZzzzzzZZzZZzzZzz
-3:00am: watching Romeo & Juliet *mouthing the lines as the film plays on*
</lj-cut>
no profound thoughts."

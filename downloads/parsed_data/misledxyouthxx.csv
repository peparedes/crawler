Curry had to go home for a test that he diden't take, so we drove him home. Then we went to Nat's house picked Nat and Glen up and went to the mall. we met Skipero there and gina got off work at 6. Then cristina and erin came and met up with us, that was ill.  Then some shit went down and they stayed with gina for a little but its all good.  All in all it was a really fun night."

"event","This has been by far the worst summer yet. its started off well but it just seemed to get worse and worse. Bill cant ride his bike anymore. Everyone hates everyone. The middle school got riped down :( . nothing good has come out of it. 5,000$ lawyers and court dates are no fun. The only good thing that came out of this summer was riding moto cross, but i blew up my dirt bike to many times this summer so i don't no.

I have to add that Yes i had a lot of fun at Gina's block party. Her family was making me drinks and the keg. sooo good!"

"event","New Hampshire was amazing, that might have been the best trip of the summer.  riding the track at Darin's house was amazing.  The track was so nice. The jumps were smooth, the berms were loose and fast it was great. My bike wasn't running yet, so i rode the YZ250F and Darrin's RM125. Both of the bikes are so fast. The Best jump there was the ""60 Footer"", It was pretty easy cause there was a short straight out of a clay berm. I ate it off a step up went to fast overshot it and nose dove and landed flat and slammed my chest of the bar pad. I'm pretty sore but it was so good."

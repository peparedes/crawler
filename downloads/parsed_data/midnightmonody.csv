"event","So it's 1:30 and here I am on the internets (George Bush joke)  and I am starving.  I need some more money to eat, between here and work I've eaten about thirty huge Strawberries because they were free.  I swear if my fecal matter ain't bright red by tomorrow I'll be surprised.  I find it strange that I consider money spent on food a waste, thus I don't buy food unless I am starving to the point of physical pain.

Tomorrow I am waking at 8 am, why?  Not because I have to, because I want to condition my body, I really don't like being up this late and waking up at 10 or 11, it feels like such a big chunk of usable time is taken away.  I want to be up by 7 and in bed as soon as I get home and showered from work, so that means midnight.  On weekends...I will never sleep, or oversleep.

My payday is tomorrow so that means I will be making a few purchases:  School books...two of them...which will probably total over 150 dollars...fucking book companies make a killing by stealing the bread money from poor college kids.  Did you know that publishing companies come out with new editions every year just for the sake of profits, so that teachers have to have their students buy the newest editions.  This way there aren't as many used books in circulation that can be used for the classes.

Sad thing is these ""new editions"" are simply nothing more than cosmetic changes, a few extra pictures, a new cover, a few chapters in different place, different questions.  They are pretty much the same.

In edition to the books, I will have to buy a nine volt battery for my bass, and probably new strings too.  The ones I have been using are well over 6 months old, you should change them every 3 months.  Got to buy work gloves too, sick of having my hands covered in Chinese dust and rat feces... I work in shipping and receiving.  

I forget how to do LJ cuts, sorry."

<div class=""ljcut"">Hooo hhumm this time it better work!
<br /><br />So the night begins with JB, Keith, and Myself going to find this abandoned Zoo in Hudson. We scout out the area and man was it awesome, all kinds of huge buildings. We never got out of the car, just drove around looking for places to get in and park later. So we leave there and head on down to Leda Lanes, the local slightly famous candlepin bowling alley (one of three in New Hampshire). There we meet up with Vissa and Joe Rogan, they play a few rounds, I go get Garitron, they a play a few more rounds then we go on back to the Zoo. <br /><br />Vissa had parted ways with us at Leda Lanes so it was down to just the five of -us. We made a qucik stop at taco bell, and 7-11 and then rode forth into battle. We parked on some side street, made a madman's dash into the cover of the woods on the other side of the street, walked around in lots o' thorns (I've cuts all over my hands and face.) We found the biggest building, but alas it was being renovated so we thought was wise not to try and bust in. We trudged back again in dismay through the bramble and thorns and made our way down another path. We came out into a huge area that seemed to be under construction for the earth was all bare frozen mud, we exited the adventure back onto the main road and walked some up the hill 'til we came to another entrance. We hopped the fence, poor joe Rogan cut his hand pretty deep, and slashed his jacket, Jb somehow flew over the fence. There we found some more once abandoned buildings under construcion but we came upon one that was not, the coolest one too luckily. It was the building where they kept the animals, cages on the outside and pens on the inside. We went into the cage and I had the strangest feeling, very dark and fear mongering. We exited the cage and to our luck the door to the building was wide open. We hop inside see all kinds of spray paint and broken things and then find a room that looked to be a kitchen. We went in and found a ladder that led up into a loft were some kind of monkey our bird used to live. That being done, with cold in our bones and blood on some of our skins we left the Zoo behind. There I split company from my men, and their adventures laid elsewhere, for I had already made plans with Kate and Binx, and as well as I can I try never to break plans. <br /><br />I pick her up from Downtown and I find out Binx is sleeping, so we decide to go anyways. I go home and try to find some pants that don't have a huge whole in the thigh like the ones I have on now, but alas none were to be had. We arrive there (the Zoo again hahah) and this time having some foreknowledge of the area I managed to keep us on path the whole time and we never ran into many thorns. Seeing how awesome of explorers we were we found something new right off the bat, a random bridge over a small stream. We went over it , I payed the toll (a silly ritual I have when I cross over foot bridges, I always throw change into the river). We explored the same building earlier mentioned, but we explored it more fully I think, or atleast I did for it looked differnt in someways some more cages and such I didn't notcie, like the random fountain. After this we stumbled around some old paths making fun of eachother, and to my jollyness I heard the sweet voice of a creature known as the great horned owl. It seemed as a guide for after following it unintentionally we came to a Barn, another new place we didn't discover earlier. We looked inside, not much there so we exited. There I saw the owl take flight from the building into the trees beyond. We continued down further and through our great vikingness we found another new building, the Gorilla cage. We checked it out, and went into the Women's room bah ah ah such witty spray painters. After this we went forward and came to the end of the path at some pond, and call me Ishmael if I am a liar but I heard something jump into the water. We got lost ut eventually found our way out. <br /><br />Our next adventure was mainly driving around, joking, yelling at people, yelling at Schwann's house. After this I dropped her off, and then a wanderlust burned in me so I drove as far as I could on one street for an hour simply because I had never been down that road. My goal in life is to explore all roads to all ends, to see all there is to be seen. All in all a wonderful night with awesome people, I hope these days never die.</div>"

"event","Time for the first full update..hopefully none of you fall asleep.&nbsp; Below shall be scribed:&nbsp; a)&nbsp; A strange dream that I had that would definitely make an awesome sci-fi channel movie.&nbsp; b)&nbsp; my thoughts on food nowadays.&nbsp; and c)&nbsp; A funny little story about my family history and modern terrorists.&nbsp;&nbsp;All mentioned are contained within the LJ cut below&nbsp; ::whirrly gigs and whistles::<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v381/rhaven87/Devaney.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><font size=""2"">&lt;lj-cut text=""Hell's sold out, and Heaven's closed""&gt;&nbsp;<br /><br />A dream within a dream?&nbsp; No...Divine inspiration?&nbsp; My dreams are quite vivid sometimes and I know that something is trying to tell me what to write about or sing about or sometimes it even tells me music, if only I had a good memory and knew how to write sheet music.&nbsp; For example one time I heard the most beautiful song in my head it was a mix of classical music and celtic folk music complete with Celtic guitar and the six stringed hand harp.&nbsp; But alas I can not remember the melody nor the harmony, I just have a memory of&nbsp;music that should have been.&nbsp; But anyways on to the real topic.&nbsp; A few nights ago I had a very vivid and long, detailed dream.&nbsp; It began like this,,,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some friends, my mom's boyfriend and I were at the beach fishing.&nbsp; We were about to leave when I felt a weight at the end of my line.&nbsp; I figured it was probably a tire so I began to reel it in.&nbsp; Then the tide helps bring it in and to my surprise it is a huge (about the size of me) Catfish like fish, it was green and had feelers like a catfish, but it had all kinds of strange symbols on it.&nbsp; So I decided to keep it, and threw it in the back of a pickup, conveniently filled with salt water.&nbsp; I drive it to some weird aquarium/ancient history museum and they put it in a large tank.&nbsp; So I and some friend only from that dream who was an old black scientist were walking through the exhibits and looking at things.&nbsp; Then he passed one exhibit and grew very alarmed.&nbsp; Apparently the fish was none other than the one that was carved into some large clay pot that was in the museum.&nbsp; On the pot was shown in relief many men worshiping the fish and making offerings to it.&nbsp; He told me that the fish I had caught was the same, and that it was an ancient witch who took on the form of a large fish and destroyed ships, ate men, and all kinds of other nasty things.<br />&nbsp; Like all cheap movies just when the story was finished the tanks all began to burst open, the witch used her mind to break all the glass and some how the place was waterproof so all the halls became filled with water, but we could all breathe somehow?&nbsp; A huge shark attacks me, I throw it in a closet.&nbsp; Then the fish shape shifts into a woman and says that I must die for what I have done, it is my destiny or something.&nbsp; So she finds a cadaver that is just the torso and legs, and it is filled with pig entrails.&nbsp; She empowers it via necromancy and it begins to chase me around.&nbsp; I find a shotgun, and like in all dreams it doesn't work.&nbsp; I wake up.<br />&nbsp; Now tell me that doesn't make for a cheesy straight to dvd sci-fi movie.<br /><br /><br /><br />Part Duex<br /><br />We as humans consume so many foul and corrupted things.&nbsp; All pumped up with nice chemicals, pesticides, preservatives.&nbsp; Sure it keeps longer and looks cleaner, smells nicer but is it really still as wholesome?&nbsp; I personally think one of the reasons so many Americans die early is the way we process food.&nbsp; There are cultures in Southeast Asia where most of the men live to be 90 and are not bed bound vegetables., here most people die off at 70 and are usually very crippled and weak.&nbsp; I try as much as time and my wallet allows to eat good natural food, even if it has things I am unaware of.&nbsp; I stay away from all kinds of sweets, pickled foods, processed meats, frozen dinners, fast food, hell I haven't had a soda for years now.&nbsp; I find that natural food tastes better too.&nbsp; If I had the money I would live off&nbsp; honey, water, berries, roots, some meats, bread, milk, cheese.&nbsp; In short the Heathen's diet.<br /><br />How I would kill for a caribou steak right now.<br /><br />Now to the last part, anyone still reading?<br /><br />So yesterday I was researching my family tales and stories and came across a slogan our family used to shout in battle long ago in heathen times.&nbsp; ""Leamh Dearg Abu!""&nbsp; or in English ""The Red Hand forever!""&nbsp; The Red hand is a symbol of my family and it is the main figure on our coat of arms.&nbsp; The red hand comes from a&nbsp;legend in which our sires had a race to claim kingship over Ireland, oh sweet Eireann.&nbsp; Yes I am according to tale the descendant of the first Milesian man to land in Ireland, there were other races there but the Milesians are the only ones that remain today.&nbsp; Well two brothers were in ships and came in sight of the shore, one said to the other&nbsp;""whoever lands there first the Druids say will be the first high king, let us have a race in the row boats and see who shall be king first.""&nbsp; So the two brothers raced and then when one saw he was loosing he cut off his hand (the red hand) and tossed it to shore thus securing kingship over the new land.&nbsp; That is why the Red hand is upon my families shield, but now to the point..terrorists using my family slogan!&nbsp; It seems that when I was researching my family I came across these boys<br /><br /><img height=""380"" alt="""" width=""568"" src=""http://www.nireland.com/petemc/uvf(1).jpg"" /><br /><br />They use my families slogan as their motto, and as you can see there is my families ""Red Hand""&nbsp; placed upon their banner.&nbsp; This is an Irish Protestant terrorist group whose main goal is to stop The republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland from becoming one again.&nbsp; It is a shame upon me that they would dare use my families crest and motto in their quest.&nbsp; I am sure that maybe founders of the group were distant relatives but it still doesn't let me rest knowing that my ancestors are shamed by these filth.<br /></font>"

"event","A question for all the ladies, even though I bet none read my journal :(

If I wanted to woo over a woman, how can I look less like a viking, because all I know how to go is the viking look, and no woman I have met has liked it.  I will never cut my hair though, it gives me evil powers, but I mean do I look better now without the beard, or would I look better with facial hair to hide my trollish face.  I love beards and such but I know many woman find them downright disgusting.  I mean I am humble and such but I know I am not an ugly man but it seems like I can never find a decent woman, I have had a few that I liked alot but none of them last, or they end up being terrible people, I have probably had only one good looking, nice girl, all the others were either bad looking, or had terrible personalities or both.

What I hate the most is when I find out a girl I once liked used to like me but now months later she doesn't or has a boyfreind. 

Another thing I am stuck on in decisions, what to do with woman?  Should I seek out someone to love, and have for a long time, which is what I want more than ever but it seems too Idyllic, or should I just have fun and enjoy youth hedonistically with many different women.  Which is fun, and also I won't be able to do that when I get older.


And why does it always seem the one woman I ever want is impossible to have because all the normal means by which I woo woman , won't work on that one?


Damn my mortal shell!


Hail Oden!


And when the hell are all my old freinds and other such people going to start hanging out again!

oH YEAH!

and her is my cell phone number is 966-8369  Sooooo everyone should call me up or text me to hang out or just talk cause, I don't use it at all now that I am single again!?!"

 Actor Pat Morita, whose portrayal of the wise and dry-witted Mr. Miyagi in ""The Karate Kid"" earned him an Oscar nomination, has died. He was 73.

Morita died Thursday at his home in Las Vegas of natural causes, said his wife of 12 years, Evelyn. She said in a statement that her husband, who first rose to fame with a role on ""Happy Days,"" had ""dedicated his entire life to acting and comedy.""

In 1984, he appeared in the role that would define his career and spawn countless affectionate imitations. As Kesuke Miyagi, the mentor to Ralph Macchio's ""Daniel-san,"" he taught karate while trying to catch flies with chopsticks and offering such advice as ""wax on, wax off"" to guide Daniel through chores to improve his skills.

Morita said in a 1986 interview with The Associated Press he was billed as Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita in the film because producer Jerry Weintraub wanted him to sound more ethnic. He said he used the billing because it was ""the only name my parents gave me.""

He lost the 1984 best supporting actor award to Haing S. Ngor, who appeared in ""The Killing Fields.""

For years, Morita played small and sometimes demeaning roles in such films as ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" and TV series such as ""The Odd Couple"" and ""Green Acres."" His first breakthrough came with ""Happy Days,"" and he followed with his own brief series, ""Mr. T and Tina.""

""The Karate Kid,"" led to three sequels, the last of which, 1994's ""The Next Karate Kid,"" paired him with a young Hilary Swank.

Morita was prolific outside of the ""Karate Kid"" series as well, appearing in ""Honeymoon in Vegas,"" ""Spy Hard,"" ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"" and ""The Center of the World."" He also provided the voice for a character in the Disney movie ""Mulan"" in 1998.

Born in northern California on June 28, 1932, the son of migrant fruit pickers, Morita spent most of his early years in the hospital with spinal tuberculosis. He later recovered only to be sent to a Japanese-American internment camp in Arizona during World War II.

""One day I was an invalid,"" he recalled in a 1989 AP interview. ""The next day I was public enemy No. 1 being escorted to an internment camp by an FBI agent wearing a piece.""

After the war, Morita's family tried to repair their finances by operating a Sacramento restaurant. It was there that Morita first tried his comedy on patrons.

Because prospects for a Japanese-American standup comic seemed poor, Morita found steady work in computers at Aerojet General. But at age 30 he entered show business full time.

""Only in America could you get away with the kind of comedy I did,"" he commented. ""If I tried it in Japan before the war, it would have been considered blasphemy, and I would have ended in leg irons. ""

Morita is survived by his wife and three daughters from a previous marriage."

<P>Orphaned Land, Folk metal hailing from the deserts of Isreal.&nbsp; One of the finest and few Eastern Folk metal bands around.&nbsp; They combine Progressive metal skills with traditional middle eastern folk elements and give the whole thing and epic story between Christianity, Judiasm, and Islam.&nbsp; Sure all their songs are religous but not in the sense of ""become or jew or go to hell""&nbsp; more in the sense of drawing influece from the great religions of the middle east.&nbsp; The album ""Mabool"" is a must have for any folk metal fan, or metal fan in general, it is enjoyable even beyond just the novelty sense of a unique metal style.</P>

A lot has happened since I last updated I think.
I am single, and looking for a good woman to love, I work full time as a reciever now...hahah reciever.
Radiata stories is the best rpg ever, I don't know why I havent played it yet today.
Therion was epic live.
I havent been writing or playing much bass lately, but I will soon.
I am takings SATs soon.
I had crazy dreams last night and so I will right them down kinda, and I have no idea why but Indians were in it alot haha.

The first one was kinda realistic, I was with my girlfreind (who happened to be an Indian girl I used to like back in the day).  we were talking about some trip we were going on, some wierd guy comes out of no where and tries to kidnap her so I go all crazy and start fighting him like a ninja and chase him off...and thats all I remember from that one.  Next one...I was walking down a street and I see this fisher cat and it goes over to this little indian boy who is about a foot tall and it picks him up and starts slamming his head against a wall, so I run over save the kid and crush the fisher cats head in my hands and throw him into the sea.

the next one ties into the first dream, I guess when I was going home from my ""girlfreinds house""  I somehow got launched into the future, and I said ""damn now I am going to miss the trip she will think I am ditching her""  all of a sudden these huge robots come marching out of no where and I boot it.  then all the robots are hunting me down, I guess they are cops?  and sylvester stalone comes out of nowhere and wants to fight me, he has a gun so I say ""lets fight like men""  so he drops the gun and I rip his leg off and destroy him, then the robots catch me and sylvester stalone minus one leg walks up to me and I wake up."

I just bought Trigun season volume one, and Family guy volume two, season three which came with a shirt.  So now I really have no reason to stay up 'til four everynight other than random news, documentries, history shows, or some ok anime, and futurama which kinda sucks.

Speaking of sucks I have work tonight 'til 1:30  I wish I had more than one or two friends who would hang out that late!

Well nothing is new, still single, working full time, taking SAT'S October 9th.

First thing I remember is being in trees above water with my friends and all of a sudden octopi start climbing up the trees after us, then we get in a raft and paddle around the flooded city.

after this my band (Chris, I, and some cool metal people)  were playing a battle of the bands we had three songs and no one ever taught me the bass to them I guess it was because I was lost when trying to get there, however we wing it and win.

My band should get going soon, I mean 200 a month for rent is awesomE.  and so many people are lined up to try out

The makers of Bust-Up gum are making an extraordinary claim for women: Chewing this gum will increase the size of their breasts. Medical News Today, the New York Daily News, and the BBC News all report that the gum contains extracts from the Pueraria mirifica (Kwao Krua) plant, the magic ingredient that will make a woman's breasts grow, as well as improve their shape and tone. Chew the gum and the extracts are slowly released.""

I got a brand new car bitch is I am going to have to work like crazy to afford it because I have to get insurance on my own which is like 400 a month as opposed to 80 a month when I was under my mom.

Oh well at least I have a cd player in it and its a reliable car.

Well that means once school comes Kyle will no longer sleep he will be working, schooling, practing bass, and writing.

We fucking need a practice space so many people are asking in on my band lately and I have so many people set up to try out.

a lot of guitarists into the metal we like.

We had it best at Wayne's not only because it was free, but we bassically practiced whenever, and it was our freind's house so we always hung out there and we didn't have to worry about or stuff getting stolen or anything.  But I am sure wayne's grandpa wouldn't like us back there again hahah and he will probably be back home in september.

If I begged my mom endlessly I bet I might be able to get us in here but we would only be able to practice til five on week days and not at all on weekends.

if we rent it is going to cost money and I know Chris will pay but I would much rather have like four or five helping out because I don't think I could take on too much more finacially.  I am not even sure if I iwll be able to gather enough money for Prog-Power fest.

Other than that life is good, good friends, good girlfreind, new car, starting to write alot."

It has seemed like nothing to epic has happened yet.
Where are all the bike rides, the trips, the ass battles, the touchfests.

are we stuck to just bowling and hanging out at 10:30 at night,

Where is all the Gary's?

And Why! hasn't Rey come back, did he truly take it too personally, oh well.


I might have my new car next week.

When I get my new car that means trips all the time, visits to the chosen one, various woods, and beaches.



The only things we have really done epic were all in May and June.

August! August better be the best of the three months of summer, for it is the last we have.

DAY OF THE DEAD: CONTAGIUM (PREQUEL)
Sometime in 1968 a strange viral outbreak is contained within the walls of a military hospital in Pennsylvania: all those exposed are destroyed and burned to the ground. A wall of silence befalls the incidence, and soon enough only a vague myth remains. The hospital becomes a civilian mental treatment center.

UNDEAD
Peaceful, rustic Berkeley is a charming fishing community where life is sweet and the people friendly. All that is about to change. After losing her childhood farm to the bank, local beauty Rene decides to leave town and head for the big city. Suddenly, an avalanche of meteorites races through the sky, bombarding the town and bringing an otherworldly infection. Departing is going to be much more difficult than she had planned.

THE WRETCHED 
The story follows bounty hunter named Rellik, whose job is to help wipe out the population of undead in the Old West. He takes a young man nicknamed ""Twenty-One"" under his wing to show him the ropes, but after returning from a successful capture they find discover that some settlers have accidentally unleashed all the undead from their holding place.

The mamas and the papas, cream, led zepplin, roy orbison.....


I have diversified I must say.  I find that I enjoy early rock and some jazz, I love classical.

So who wants to hang out?
We are sexy men with metal inour blood.

Ps manowar lyrics are the anthems of metalheads everywhere.
 ""All Men Play On Ten""


I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

I coconut tossed the ball on purpose, landing no less then a foot from the pins..sadly in the gutter.

Then as soon as that happens Mack one ups me and the ball flys back into the seats.

Amanda was there, she is a cool person, very enjoyable, She is really shy but it is her first time hanging out, we are all shy too just not when together hahah.

I hope we all get together and hang out tonight...touchfest?"

"event","Metal!@

So we had a little band practice not much done but it was fun.
I feel really metal right now with my hair all tangled and sitting in clothes from yesterday, haven't shaved since last sunday?.

I didn't sleep last night at all, really none, maybe one hour this morning.

I want to get a practice space pretty soon.

We need to try out so many people.!!!!@#

I dislike Dimmu alot but this song is cool ""blood hunger doctrine"" only because of the cool keyboards and synths.

astarte is cool it is an all female black metal band, really good black metal at that, almost prog.

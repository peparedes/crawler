"event","i don't write much in this thing these days.  i keep my thoughts away from prying eyes.  the hippies were right about one thing, whether they meant to be or not: work takes away from one's ability to create.  i work so much that creative time is quashed.  any spark to create is lost in the oblivion of exhaustion on a nightly basis.  thanks to the record, i totally need the money.  it hasn't quite finished sucking my blood yet.  its easy to realize that the term ""starving artist"" is ironic as hell.  but we gotta starve to be hungry i guess.  i knew there was more than one reason that phrase resonated.

i'd rather be poor and in love, but in the absence of that, might as well save some money for whenever that day might come.  love is rough on the bank account.  but i guess so is being alone and spending money in dives to try as hard as you can to forget about it.

life sucks, but life itself is fucking awesome.  i teeter on this thought.  maybe everybody spends a lot of time thinking about what they don't have/what they want, and not enough time realizing they're alive and that there's rad things going on everywhere and rad people that give a shit about you, and don't mind a bit if you give a shit about them.

i have these kinds of repetitive realizations about once every other month or so.  i wish i could make them stick a little longer before all the world's trivial shit sets in again, but its tough.  it takes a mental discipline i haven't fully mastered.  there was a time where i held that thought pretty damn tightly for a long time.  then something happened.  not sure what it was, but it made me revel in things too much.  seems like a long time ago.  but maybe i can bring it back somehow.  it sets in without me even realizing it sometimes.  i'll be in a good conversation and being completely myself for once, and let my guard down without even paying attention.

anyway, people should watch John From Cincinatti, that show rules, and i don't even like TV."

"event","passing time isn't what it used to be.
had wine and Bass and good food my boss made last night and gave her some guitar pointers.
it is, however, funny how perceptions change within a course of weeks.
i don't think i've ever been so content being alone as i am now.
i feel bad that i don't have time for everyone sometimes.
i work a whole lot.
there are people i should be spending more time with.
and they include the J.O.P gentlemen and Maddy and all those guys.
i feel welcomed when they're around.
i'm in a rut but i don't plan on being there for long.
i can feel the good things creeping back.
blooming now that winter has left.
but i am in this one-track, hang out by myself kind of mode lately.
and that's cool, i need to re-charge.

geoff, you'd be happy to know (maybe) that i had a really cool dream last night.  i don't remember almost any of it because when i woke up the first time from it, i immediately fell back to sleep while i was trying to figure out what had happened.  all i know is my friend mai was in it.  we were running around doing something.  i need to make more effort at remembering them, like you do man."

"event","I found this cool piece Tom Petty wrote about what he's learned over his life, that he was asked to write by some magazine.  He's one of my favorites and he talks about John Lennon and Sid Vicious in the same sentence.  Fuck yeah.



""I don't think I've learned anything that I didn't already know. I just didn't recognize it at first. 

When I met Elvis, we didn't really have a conversation. I was introduced by my uncle, and he sort of grunted my way. What stays with me is the whole scene. I had never seen a real mob scene before. I was really young and impressionable. Elvis really did look -- he looked sort of not real, as if he were glowing. He was astounding, even spiritual. It was like a procession in church: a line of white Cadillacs and mohair suits and pompadours so black, they were blue. 

The energy of the crowd is insane. Twenty thousand people. It's the biggest jolt of adrenaline. It's very hard to explain. You know the old story about the woman lifting the car off her kid? It's in that realm. You can actually hurt yourself and not know it. 

If you're phony, they will feel it in the farthest row of the arena. You have to really care. And you have to make yourself care time and time again. 

I remember John Lennon saying, ""Sid Vicious died for what? So that we might rock?"" You've got to keep that in perspective. At the end of the day, they're just phonograph records. 

Do something you really like, and hopefully it pays the rent. As far as I'm concerned, that's success. 

I feel sorry for kids these days. They get so much homework. Remember the days when we put a belt around our two books and carried them home? Now they're dragging a suitcase. They have school all day, then homework from six until eleven. There's no time left to be creative. The hardest part for me is when my thirteen-year-old is complaining about the workload. I agree with him. I'm supposed to be responsible and support the teacher. But it's like, ""You're right, son. This is (crap)."" 

If we're born in God's image, then God knows how we can (screw) up. And he knows that you really didn't mean it. 

I like to be an optimist, but I like to be a realist, too. 

The war in Iraq is shameful. Whether you're pro or con Bush, you've got to admit: The guy lied. And he continues to do so. I can't understand why he's just not run out on a rail. To send somebody's kids off and have them killed for no good reason -- he's going to have his day in hell for that. I wouldn't want that karma. 

When you kill somebody's little sister with a missile, he's going to hate you forever. And the next generation will hate you even more. 

The great thing about the Wilburys was that none of us had to take the heat by ourselves. I was just a member of the band. Nobody felt like he was above anybody else. We had such a good time. 

There used to be this real sense of community integrity in rock. It has really eroded. Everyone seems to be on their own now. 

When my record company rejected Full Moon Fever, I was hurt so bad. I was pretty far along in my career at that point. I'd never had anything rejected; I'd never really even had a comment. So when that happened, it was really just a board to the forehead. But then finally I picked myself up. I said, ""I'm not buying this, there's nothing wrong, I really like this record."" And then I waited awhile, until the top regime at the record company changed. And I came back and I played them the same record, and they were overjoyed. It turned out to be a huge hit. 

""Free Fallin'"" is a very good song. Maybe it would be one of my favorites if it hadn't become this huge anthem. But I'm grateful that people like it. 

I guess if I were this age and nothing had gone right, it would really be bad.  

What I've learned about marriage: You need to have each other's back; you have to be a kind of team going through life. That's beautiful-to have that kind of friendship. You're going to need it when you get old. 

Rock 'n' roll was one thing, and then they chopped off the roll and called it rock, which became a sort of umbrella term for anything with a guitar in it. Like hair bands. How could we possibly believe that? It's just gotten downright silly, to the point where now it's sort of become like professional wrestling. The fans know it's phony, but they don't care. 

I couldn't exist nowadays. I could never have built a career like I've had if I were just starting out now. Radio doesn't take a chance on anything anymore; they've streamlined the playlists to the lowest common denominator. It's really kind of silly that they think people would rather hear ""Stairway to Heaven"" one more time than a new song. 

As you're coming up, you're recognized song for song or album for album. What's changed these days is that the man who approaches me on the street is more or less thanking me for a body of work -- the soundtrack to his life, as a lot of them say. And that's a wonderful feeling. 

It's all an artist can ask."""

"event","i think i spend so much time trying to be who i'd like to be that it has become really hard to be myself.

i'm mostly myself.
but i'm especially myself only around a few people.
i don't think i'm even myself around my band, my mates, with whom i share this weird urge to do something cool and creative with my life.

i'm not going to beat myself up about it.
but i think i spend more time drinking than i do focusing right now.
and i need to change that.
i think i come out about 50% of the time and i could be better.

i feel like i should be cool when i really should just be myself, which may or may not be cool.

but what the hell?
i try to pretend like i don't give a shit about what people think about me, which is true.
but perhaps i spend more time trumpeting that and being a hardass than actually just going about my daily business.
like, as opposed to just enjoying my days, that ""not giving a shit what people say"" is some sort of macho activity i'm engaged in on a regular basis.

that needs to stop.
i feel good being single for the past year plus.
because i feel like that has helped me learn who i am as an individual.
but i haven't quite mastered the art of self-realization.

friends are supportive for as far as you let them in.
but its hard not to have someone in particular to bounce things off of.
that is something i have always thrived on in relationships, but haven't been able to do myself as much.
and in a way, its good, because it helps to separate who i really like from who i'm just dating because they are cute or cool or whatever one-dimensional reason i asked them out.

being single has unintentionally turned me into a one-dimensional person in some ways.

and i think i've just learned that it is a status and not a state of mind.

that sort of status is unimportant, like my social security number or zip code or something.

i need to keep going about my business.
doing  my thing.
and not TRYING to be anything in particular than what i am.

rad."

They are hard to gauge.
They are simpler,
sometimes heavier.

I am going to assign them a setting and a plot and a storyline.

Maybe Time pictures of the year.

party at my house, lots of music being played.
we played early, like around 9 and it was kind of cool because all these people i didn't even realized were going to come, showed up out of thin air and were down in our basement during our set.
so, our set...
borrowed jake's guitar, which i broke two strings on.
fell over our PA and fucked up my leg.
I thought I had broken it initially, but its just badly bruised.
the limp has almost gone away though.
all these years of rocking out without fear of physical retribution, and i finally injure myself more than cuts, bruises, bloody knees, and cuticles.
those were my trademark.
perhaps i have graduated to bruising limbs and breaking bones.
or maybe it is because i am only 35 years away from being able to order from the 'Senior Menu' at Denny's.

I invited maybe 20 people openly, and like 50 showed up.
it was a great time, but i was running around so much (well 'limping' is probably the better word),
that I didn't really get a chance to talk to anybody.
Jessikuh rolled up and she was definately acting more weird than I was,
which is a small victory for me, in that I've gotten over her so much.
It was cool chilling with her for a bit despite the awkward silences that screamed ""[insert old chemistry here].""

But I have to throw the love out there.
There were so many good people I love so much there, and you guys rule for coming.
Every time there is a party or show and a bus load of people I adore roll up,
It makes me feel so amazing.
I'm a very lucky guy.

Most of the people I really wanted to hang out with left mucho early.
But there will be other times.
I should probably shower, brush my teeth, and go home and clean stuff up, but instead i'm probably going to go chill at chris' house.

Though Anna sort of stands in the ""girlfriend"" role whenever she is around me in a crowd of people, the lack of consistent affection was very evident to me last night.
I would love it if she and I began dating again, but I don't foresee that happening.

Tulsa brought a cute girl she said should be my girlfriend.  :)
You rule Tulsa.
I was intrigued but was too busy to get to hang out with said girl.
I'm going to call you this week Tulsa,
i haven't been on a date since like October..."

"event","the beatles said it best.
""i want you so bad, that its driving me mad, its driving me mad.""
i got a kiss on the cheek.
i know i'm not in kindergarten, and she charged me a quarter (i'm serious, but it was sort of a joke).
it still drove me nuts.
i'm never going to grow up.
when i meet someone i'm really into, i get so taken aback by the littlest things.
she has dubbed me, ""romantic.""
and i guess she's right.
its weird to be that in a world where romance seems to be dieing off like the coastlines.
but i think there is a difference between wanting to be romantic, and unintentionally being that way.
i can't help but caught up in these things.
my reality is an odd one, and i guess i sort of accidently fit as a ""romantic,"" though my tendencies usually sway towards ""realist.""
bah, i get worked up over girls too easily.
i think i am a dieing breed with no natural habitat."

But I've realized there isn't a whole lot to do when you're already friends,
and they're not over their ex one bit.
So that's okay.
My love life is so terminally non-existent.
Has been for a while now.
But what's important is I realize it, temper it, not worry too much about it.
She knows how I feel,
and what's cool is she's cool with the couple of times I've brought it up (usually when intoxicated).
This assures me she really is something special.
Because she realizes its just a side of me that gets that way.
I don't mean to threaten anyone with it.
And I'm totally comfortable liking someone romantically, even if we are just friends.
This is odd.
I played her some songs, in my cement, empty basement of my new place.
Seemed to make her happy.
She celebrates the parts of me I'd rather not expose.
What is that?
Whatever it is, I'm a lucky guy to have a friend like that.
A lucky single guy.
But all of that is okay.
Because I can be satisfied in just knowing someone and being a close friend of someone like that,
its weird to be intimately connected to someone and not 'involved.'
But all of it is okay.
It'll become something if it is supposed to.

i just hope kenzie's eye is doing okay, she got quite a shiner from bumping into my guitar.

there were drunks everywhere, just the way it should be.

i'm obviously not in the most descriptive mood.
the party had so much going on, it was hard to make mental note of too much.
but when i fucked up my neck crashing into a wall, like 5 people gave me a neck rub.

i like 2 girls.
both have complications involved.

i think i just find it easier being alone now, and that hasn't ever lasted with any real consistency in the past.

hung out with my surrogate family, the brohawns, and watched the ravens game, which is only really interesting when there is beer, good food, and good people.

then headed to my friend Dominique's birthday party,
sung some Entrance songs around the fire with Dan and Fletcher and Maddy and with Geff playing fiddle,
and saw lots of good people i had missed 'quite much.'

then off to the stolen heart cabaret to see Johnny and Jacob and Walter and Paco play their music/art,
and run into Caroline, back from Alaska.
She is probably the most adorable secret crush ever.

Then back to Chrissy's to watch Bottle Rocket and play with the cat.

so much going on dude.
i'm psyched that i'm moving into a new place pretty soon, down in hampden.
helped johnny clear some of the stuff out of there the other day,
so that's exciting.

i also got calls about 2, count'em 2, potential 2nd job opportunities.
that doesn't usually happen.
i'm going to working with autistic kids for 5 sundays between late october and mid-december for some extra money.
and i have an interview to work for camel cigarettes tomorrow.
who knew being a barfly would present such an opportunity?
if i get the job i'll be making $17/hour a couple of days a week, which would be awesome.
it would be on weekend nights, which sucks, but i'm usually at the bar those nights anyway, why not get paid for it?
so i'll be teacher by day, vice peddler by night.
batman's got nothing on me.

went on a quasi-date with this girl anna last night.
we went and played pool for a bit and had a really good time.
i was hopped up 2 cups of coffee and a 12oz coke from my lunch with emily, which was really cool too.
makes me wicked talkative with so much caffeine in my system.
i try to avoid the stuff.
but we're supposed to hang out this weekend, and for once i felt like it was okay with this girl not to make a move too soon or anything.
she's very chill and seems as laid back and cautious as i am.
and dammit, she's a nice girl, you know, the kind i'm not usually attracted to?
but i like her.
and she's cool.
so we'll see what happens.

aside from money woes, that may yet be remedied in the near future,
stuff seems to be okay.
i've been working on some new music.
have a show this saturday, for the first time in a while.
i have to call the band manager guy sometime, probably tomorrow when i'm less busy.
i can say things are going pretty well :)
i wonder if we are stuck with bouts of shitty things happening, or just plain old emotional inactivity so that we can save up to cash in for the good stuff.
it feels good because i know with all this stuff going on, that maybe for once, i can handle it.
i feel like i've got the good head on my shoulders everyone tells me i've always had.
but i feel confident and excited,
and my horoscope says i need to celebrate.
so maybe i'll have a party when i settle into my new place.

my birthday is soon, so maybe i'll do it then.
i've never thrown myself a party.
my friends are always really sweet and remember my birthday when i usually try to hide somewhere and avoid it.
i missed geff's birthday activities, which sucks.
but i hope to make it up to him.
i did, however, get to hang out with nick, laura, and todd for their birthdays, which all fell into the same week.

spent 4 days with my sister in bay ridge, in the extreme south of brooklyn.
i got off the bus, took the cab to meet her at this bar in the village to find my sister not there.
when i called she was upset, her bag had been stolen and with her wallet in it.
she had finished a night with her italian friend who didn't speak much english and who was flicking people in various bars apparently, and nearly got his ass kicked.
but realized she her shit was gone.

rest of the time was good though.
we ate a lot of good, fatty, new york food.
we drank a LOT of beer and wine, and i experienced maybe my 2nd hangover ever.
she took me shopping and bought me a shirt, she's always mothering me that way.
we did a lot of talking about the past and future on the back porch with our thoughts being shaken, not stirred from the alcohol.
i learned some more family secrets to go with the lot.
good times though.
she's such a sweetheart.

saw nicole last night in the lower-east side where she lives now.
she is in love with an editor from spin magazine it seems,
and she is very happy and stratifying through the independent film company she now works for.
its weird to date someone for 6 years and not see them much after, and then meet up and see where they're going now.
but it made me happy and it was a good time.

back in town, for god knows what.
moving into my new place with johnny and the gang at goodview in like a week.
camp is over, subbing starts soon but i'm going to look for something that pays better i think.
looking forward to bringing in the fall with my b-more friends.

my spiritual advisor, on 5th ave. in brooklyn had some interesting things to say about my future.
she was pretty cool.
not the swindler type i would have imagined most tarot card people to be.
a lot is supposed to be happening to me next month according to her.
and there were some comments about people in my life right now and who will be soon which were interesting as well.
i'm not sure how much i believe of this kind of stuff.
but i figure a look into your future, real or bullshit, is meant to be kept to yourself.
so i guess we'll see what comes true, and what is wishful thinking."

"event","I splurged and bought myself 'Murder Ballads' by Nick Cave today.
What a fucking awe-inspiring record.
Arguably one of the darkest things I have ever listened to.
All these folky, avant-garde sorts of songs involving homicide,
with one particularly crazy song about a guy going nuts and killing everyone in a bar.
I'm not much on murder obviously, but the artistry with which these songs were put together is amazing.
And PJ Harvey sings on the record, which is always a plus.

Life goes in a thousand directions.
And if you let yourself, its pretty easy to see a lot of days as disappointments.
But nothing is ever over.
There are setbacks, sometimes large ones,
but nothing can't be achieved to some extent, I think.

You learn a little more from every new good and bad thing that happens, though I think its easier to notice with the bad ones.
You can only hope that the people you learn them from stay along for the ride.
One thing I don't like, is how people can teach you something (usually the hard way), and would rather part ways with you then stick around to help you celebrate your maturity.
I think you can tell who your real friends are when shit happens, and you guys can remain close, smarter, and closer from having gone through it.
I have a handful of friends who have seen me at my worst, or have experienced the drawn-out learning process my mind puts me through, or my overtly delayed reactions to things I should have learned so long ago, and they have stuck around.
And I will always defend these people.
They are the ones who really care and who really matter.
And I owe them so much.

Every so often, your friends are tested by your behavior for whatever reason.
But if they know you and love you and care about you,
they see the intentions behind the mistakes.
And they read you like a fucking marquee hovering over the pavement.
To these people I am grateful.
I am nothing without you.

My LJs tend to be so self-centered.
But I use it as a tool of public self-discovery.
Perish the ego.

All I need is a smile,
and good friends
and good times
and good music to lay on the floor and close my eyes to.

It's corny but its true.
Maybe that's why we love our elders (for those who have good ones),
because their lives can be underlined in corny catch-phrases after a while.
They realize the simplicity of the explanation,
and are content in knowing how extravagant the landscape behind the cliches are.

There is so much life out there.
And it's all so fucking amazing.

My friend Shawna used to sign all her emails with:
'Love like your heart has never been broken,
and dance like no one is watching.'

I remember when I wanted nothing more than to 'let go' and 'live in the moment.'
I lost track of that somehow.
But I'm determined to find my way back to that.
It's happened a couple of times in my life.
And when I find new ways to quell the over-thoughts and the second-thoughts and the fore-thoughts,
I forget about what I was really trying to do.
It's time to get back.

I'm going to see my sister this weekend in NYC and I'm psyched.
We're always so separated, but I love her so much.
We've had this weird bond since I was a little kid.
She was the first good I can remember.
I called her for some advice late last night,
and she was at a club, and people were yelling all around her,
and she still took the time to listen and talk for a bit.

I need to start tattooing more reminders on myself."

in other news... drinking is a delectable pass-time, and i'm blacker than i have ever been, since i am in the sun at work every day.

...and the race questions will roll right in, as they often did before.  why do people care what you're ethnicity is, I wonder?  the clever, liberal arts degree answer is: human.

one world race.

Talked to the kid's mom yesterday about what to expect from the boy I'm following around.
She told me he gets 'treats for being good', 'has a tendency to run away', and 'craps his pants.'
Maybe part of the kid's problem is that his parents talk about him like he's an aging German Shephard.

Writing a lot.
Into the writing thing.
I'm in a rut in terms of adventure in my life.
But at least if I'm going to be broke I can sit around write songs about my imaginary/imagined life, the life I want, the life I had, and the life I think I will have.
Sentences with the word, 'life' in them are boring.

I'm moving in with my buddy Johnny soon, in Hampden for a couple of months I think.
I'm psyched.
It'll be nice to walk to the bar and live a few blocks from my best friends.
Except for Beth, because she has to be difficult and live on 27th street as opposed to all us hip people who live in Hampden.
C'mon Beth, get with the times!  :)
I kid you because I know you read this.

I'm ready to pull the trigger on something.
Not sure what.
But I'm in the mood to find a very large chance, and take it.
I'm sure it will determine for itself what it will be.
I'm already taking a huge gamble with this band thing.
But I want to take another one.
Gambling is addictive.
But I want to shoot craps and play poker like a pro,
raise the stakes, run the sevens, jump off a bridge with a feather in each hand and see if I can fly.
""You think I can't fly?  Well just watch me, watch me.""

The summer is winding down, and around August 17th, I will have a week before I'm back working in the public school system.
I want to take a road trip.
Any takers?"

Yeah, me.
Professional sounding job.
It's only a 4 week gig.
But its good money.
Then school starts.

I might be moving in with Johnny soon, which will be wicked awesome.
Thanks to some recent in depth conversations,
especially with the insightful Beth Wreck (I know her real last name, but 'Wreck' is probably the coolest rock 'n' roll last name ever.
I want to write a song and use this name as a title sometime, Beth, if you don't mind.
But yeah, I'm finding the inner muse again.
Long since dormant in favor of the more social ""Rob Soma"".
This is the ""Savory James"" side (as I've come to call it and which is singularly responsible for why the band name became that).
Songs are flying out.
Not all of them good.
But I had a good conversation with the awesome Yuri Zeitz @ the Ottobar last night,
about the importance of writing the mediocre songs in order to dig deep enough for the good stuff.
I envy people who can fall right down the well into the ripe side of the mind to find the good stuff right away.
I have to take the tram, and write some less good songs to get there.
Exploratory, masochistic surgery I suppose.
But I think it just takes the right attitude.
And the ability to come and go as I please, which is an ability I haven't yet mastered.
I tend to be either in that well, stuck, or I yank myself out and fear returning.
Blah.

So rock 'n' roll."

"event","This medicine my doctor gave me works but its like Chernobyl in my body.
I over-reacted once in the past 4 months or so.
I've done/said things I've regretted twice.
I'm paying for both of them.
But that's pretty good for me.
I hope I will be welcomed into the good graces of the two I affected again,
but I think everyone's allowed to screw up once in a while,
so if they don't, then that probably has less to do with me.
It is a gift to be forgiven.
But understanding is recipricol.
And if I haven't earned an inch,
then maybe there's something wrong between me and them anyway.

But aside from the graveyard going on in my body at the moment (metaphorically/medically speaking),
the days carry on as I'd hope.
I hope I get that summer camp job.
And as much as I am personally comfortable with it,
I hope people understand that I always mean well,
no matter how dumb/neurotic I get.
I think its a selfish defense mechanism for me to be weird sometimes.
Test the waters of 'WEIRD' with some people
and see how they act.
I love the people in my life.
But I don't trust easily.
So, friends, forgive me for the occasional tests I put you through.
You may not even realize they're happening.
I don't even realize I do it.
But if you notice,
you either failed miserabley, or aced the motherfucker.
Tests are stupid.
I need to become better aware of when I do it, so I can stop doing it.
But I do it.
'Nuff said.

All you need is love [buh buh buh-da buh].

I'm on pace for about 1 every day or two,
started, not completed.
its so much easier to start one than finish it.
Its amazing what you can let yourself do if you just say, 'fuck it' and go ahead.
I can't really play piano,
but i've been trying the last week or so,
and I've got the beginning of a song on piano :)
that makes me happy whether it turns out well or not.
I seem to be able to put my fingers in the write places,
just need to get that whole left hand-right hand coordination thing right,
and actually read the piano books I've had that have been collecting dust,
so I can figure out what I'm doing.

It's like learning your first bar chord and writing a bunch of 3-chord songs.
Its awesome and its making my day."

"event","its funny how the meanings behind your own words and songs can change after a while.
you'll write a song, sort of inspired by one particular person,
and it'll turn out to be more general, or even a song that translates to other people you have met.

I think about people sleeping a lot.
It's really pretty to watch people sleep sometimes or how people fall asleep and when and under what circumstance.
I've always seemed to have trouble sleeping,
but i always write about it.

I usually have to be drunk to fall asleep because 'my body hates me.'
Even when my mind runs out of reasons to keep me up at night,
my body, adaptively clever as it is, invents new ways to keep me up.
I'll probably be wide awake when I die,
with my eyes open.
And they'll have to sew them shut to make me look 'at peace' or 'asleep' as dead people as supposed to look.

Ken Lay died before his ass could rot in jail.
He got off easy.
They should send financial criminals to places like Abu Ghuraib to be stripped naked by bored American MPs and paraded around with bags over their heads while German Shephards bark at their crotches.

nights are spent at the bar,

i am currently unemployed except for the ""every once in a while"" shift at sonar.
i feel happy to be alive.
and in a sick desperation to be alive,
i feel like shit for the things that have had to happen recently to continue my trend of being grateful for what i have.
it shouldn't take someone you love dying too soon.
but i guess its better to learn from something shitty happening.
i'm visiting a friend in rehab today.
and i'm realizing how important that sort of thing really is,
no matter how slight your friendship is,
to show support for someone trying to overcome.
i didn't have the chance to do it before,

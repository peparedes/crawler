"event","Well since the wonderful response to my engagement (barely a congratulations and hug and then everyone went back to talking about anything else) I asked my father tonight if he could give me away at our wedding. And he said that most likely he can't, and then suggested that Master and I won't be together by then anyway. I knew he didn't overly approve of our relationship, but really? I understand that he may not be able to travel from Australia to the US just to give me away, but following it up with &quot;hey september next year is still a long time away, who knows if it will still be on&quot; was not exactly what I was expecting.

And now Master wants us to go back to her hometown for the last couple of weeks of my visit... and bring her mama back with us. So not only will we not be alone and have to hide the truth of our relationship... when i break both our hearts AGAIN by leaving, we will be expected to be unaffected by it, since we're only friends. HOW THE FUCK AM I MEANT TO DO THAT?

So basically, this is all FUBAR and I have no idea how to make it work. *smiles wryly* at least I don't have to worry about an extensive guest list. We'll be lucky to have 5, including the bridal party."

"event","Well here goes my second day at trying to write something daily. Apparently, most authors try to average at least 2000 words a day. That means I need to get myself into NaNo WriMo condition on a permanent basis. I really need to work on my writing space so that I have somewhere TO&nbsp;write. I don't really have space in my room for what I want, and it doesn't really help that I don't see this as home.&nbsp;I've only lived here fro the better part of 14 years, but I feel like a boarder, always intruding and imposing rather than feeling like it is &quot;home&quot;. My inspiration, my home, is Master. That makes everything more difficult than I can possibly give words to. My muse is on the other side of the world, taking my desire to write with her.

To put it in a nutshell, perhaps where it belongs, since I am sure any of you reading this - indeed if anyone is in fact reading this, does not particularly care about any of what I am complaining about. Nor I am quite certain, do you care about any of my complaints or the end product - perhaps writing on a more continuous basis. I am trying my best to not disappoint master, but she pressures me to write so much, and I want to write.It is just rather difficult considering the depressing situation I am in, which is only compounded by my disappointing Master by not writing.

Maybe by arriving in three weeks will help with my writing. I was inspired to write constantly when I was in Master's presence, but merely did not have the opportunity. I think I may as well end my rant here, I'm not really saying anything new. I shall save my few (if any) readers the pains of further flogging of the proverbial dead horse."

"event","Well.... apparently writing when you have nothing to say will get one in the habit of writing. So here is my attempt to regularly update my LJ in an attempt to write more often. Lets see how this works out because I have enough trouble writing when I DO&nbsp;have something to write about... Let alone when I have absolutely bollocks to write about. I have a real problem with procrastination when it comes to my writing. Especially lately when I have been finding every excuse to not write, and when I do sit down to write... What comes out onto the page is not great, and takes forever to get down. At this point I am willing to try this writing in my LJ daily to get into the habit of writing, if only to make me get more down on the page so Master is not so disappointed in my lack of progress in her book.<br /><br />I have been managing about 500 words a day lately in my book that I am writing for Master, and it has now reached about 36,000 words total.&nbsp;Pam tells me that I don't need to be profound or deep in my daily ramblings but merely get in the habit of sitting down and writing for X amount of time per day. I don't have much faith in being disciplined enough to keep this up for long but I shall do my best. I want to make Master proud and finally present <em>In The Fox's Lair</em> to her. Completing this of course will allow me to continue with the Trilogy and then onto other works. But I think I am so resistant because Master keeps pushing me to write. She has such faith and confidence in my writing ability and I just don't see why. <br /><br />On a completely unrelated note, I am heading back to the US for two months for Master's graduation. I can't wait, the last few months have been hell to be so far from her. It will be even more hellish to leave her again at the end of July. Goddess willing I will find some work that will let me return on a work visa so we are not at opposite corners of the globe. It will make it easier to look into our marriage too, come September next year. Well I think this ends my rambling for the day, lets see if it gets me writing more often..."

It will be interesting to see what regular - non friends people think of the story rather than what my friends have said. Its not that I don't value what they've said.... But honestly, how constructive is &quot;yeah great story Mandy&quot;? I am half prepared for it to go down in flames, but that is to be expected from this kind of thing. Look out Book Two eh? We'll see just how well this goes and how my writing develops over the course of the trilogy....

"event","The following quotes are from the Stephenie Meyer book ""New Moon"" and it perfectly describes where I have been, emotionally, for the last fifteen odd years, so here be the lines, and then what I have realised about them shall follow...
'I saw no reason for fear.&nbsp; I couldn't imagine anything in the world that there was left to be afraid of, so physically at least.&nbsp; One of the few advantages of losing everything""
'But I was getting better, and so the pain was something I could avoid for days at a time now.&nbsp; The trade off was the never ending numbness.&nbsp; Between pain and nothing, I'd chosen nothing'
'It was a crippling thing, the sensation that a huge hole has been punched through my chest, excising my most vital organs and leaving ragged, unhealed gashes around the edges that continued to throb and bleed despite the passage of time.&nbsp; I curled inward, hugging my ribs to hold myself together.&nbsp; I scrambled for my numbness, my denial, but it evaded me.&nbsp; And yet, I found I could survive.&nbsp; I was alert, I felt the pain - the aching loss that radiated out from my chest, sending waves of hurt through my limbs and head - but it was manageable.&nbsp; I could live through it.&nbsp; It didn't feel like the pain had weakened over time, rather that I'd grown strong enough to bear it'.
'I still hadn't been able to sink into my protective shell of numbness, and everything seemed oddly close and loud today, like I'd taken cotton out of my ears'
'I wondered how long this could last.&nbsp; Maybe someday, years from now - if the pain would just decrease to the point where I could bear it - ....'
'But what if the hole never got any better?&nbsp; If the raw edges never healed?&nbsp; If the damage was permanent and irreversible?""

So they are the lines, and where I have been emotionally for most of my life, and after reading this book, I recognised the feeling that was being described.&nbsp; It took about a week to realise exactly where this feeling had come from, and last night, talking to a friend, I remembered where I knew it from - the issues with my mother and the loss and pain is that conflict...I resort back to that closed off numbness whenever I speak with her, and the black hole is again wrenched open.&nbsp; I know I need to sort all this out, but I feel it would not be wise until university is over, so I have another semester of her completely clueless of my thoughts about her, and me battling with what I am feeling... At least I am no longer at that place any longer, but I have just come through it all, and there are moments when I revert back to the numbness, well as close as I can get to it"

"event","<p>I have just finished reading the two books Tim gave me - 'Twilight' and 'New Moon' by Stephanie Meyer and yet again it seems Djehuty is sending me the books that I require right now. First there were the Traci Harding books for spirituality (both for myself and my own story), then there was the Elita series for the mage battles (my story) and Robert Dunlorn's battle against a prophecy he was given at age nine, that rebelling against it and any emotions, not letting himself feel had created a blackness within him he called the Demon (for me).&nbsp; And now there were the Stephanie Meyer books.&nbsp; Other than the obvious physiological differences between Isabella (Bella) and myself, we seem to be very much alike, and the author's writing style was not just similar to my own and my mindspeech, but there were more subtle similarities.&nbsp; Even though Bella desperately declared herself a coward, her actions proved the opposite, whereas I have declared that I am no coward, but my actions have shown me for what I truely am.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also her relationship with Edward, the pain she described when he left, not only did I recognise that pain from my past, but I also felt shadows of that pain plagueing me throughout the day.&nbsp; The gaping black hole/wound that was left is something I am more familiar with than I would care to admit, not to mention the four months of Bella being like a Zombie.&nbsp; I must applaud her however, she was only that way for four months, I was there for fifteen years, and that gaping black hole is as dark as ever.&nbsp; I have been fortunate enough to escape the nightmares though.&nbsp; Do not get me wrong, I do get the occasional one, but luckily I am not one for talking in my sleep (as far as I am aware), I am susceptible to quite strange dreams, however.&nbsp; All I know is that today, I cried when Edward left, as it were a reminder of my being left once before, and I felt the illness and depression settle over me.&nbsp; There was no reason to call up the zombie-like numbness as that be too recent to be required.&nbsp; And I am glad for both our sakes (Bella and my own) that we came out of it , although at least Bella has Edward, where I, as always, am alone, perpetually alone.&nbsp; And as a final note, I could not escape the thrill and quickening of my own heartbeat at the prospect of being with one such as Edward, looks notwithstanding, the danger and excitement would be utterly irresistable.....And after that scarily long rant, I feel the need to add that I am not quite certifiable yet, I do know that these were fiction stories, just the parallels were kind of too scary to ignore....</p>"

But I just came to the realisation, that I never needed to when I was playing Basketball, I put my body through as much punishment as possible, not looking after myself, nor caring to..playing with dislocated fingers and knees, sprained ankles, torn hamstrings etc, just so that I had an outlet for all my anger and emotional baggage... Then all that went to hell in a handbasket&nbsp;when I was forced to give up basketball due to all that punishment, but I managed to hold myself together until now (5 years or so)...What I wouldn't give to pound the shite out of a basketball court once again!!!</p>"

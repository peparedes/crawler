"event","Some years Christmas makes me feel wonderful, other ist's just blah.  This year, although I wasn't given much time to absorb the season, I really got the most of out of every second there was.  The Christmas magic was realy in me.  I listened to the Carols and music on 99.9 and tried to watch all the classics like Rudolph. That was all fantastic, but this year I felt a bit more.  I really felt a sense of togeatherness and love.  My friends and I have been through so many good times, so many tough ones too.  Despite all of our troubles we all managed to stay happy and togeather even through the stress of the holiday season.  I also felt this within my home, This is the first year that my family did not have a single member who still belives in Santa Clause.  I really think it made us appreciate everything under the tree that much more, I mean I knew it was from my parents long ago but couldn't express that out loud because there was still a little on who believed.  This time the whole family was able to realize the sacrifices the others made to give everyone a good christmas.  But we didn't need the preasents really, all we needed was the gift we had all along, LOVE.  I have really never felt that real meaning of Christmas until this year and I am really glad I did.  Just the time I have spent with my family over the break and the time I have spent with my friends at school and in Disneyland was enought to make this the most blessed Christmas I have ever had.  I love everyone in my life, not only those who are close to me my parents, brothers and sisters, friends...of coarse i love them in a special way, But even those who have had the most minute affect on my life are in my thoughts this year.  I talked to a friend the other day, about who we would come to find out had some affect on us, or maybe we affected them, either way it really made me feel the incredible sense of unity in our world that I only was able to see through the love of those around me in this Christmas season."

"event","Yesterday was the much anticipated Bourgade trip to Disneyland.  Boy what a day!  There is really nothing like spending time with your best friends.  I spent the day with Gavin, Melissa, Sam, Paris, Briselda, Brandon, Tom, Mike, and a frind of Tom's who is also named Brandon.  We had so much fun and Disneyland was absolutel beautiful at Christmas time.  Haunted Mansion Holiday was really kool great FX and a very nice layover for the mansion, I thought.  But as ususl my favorite ride was Indiana Jones.  Oh and Sam really liked her lunch at the Blu Bayou, she was sooo surprised that she started crying and I am just really glad she enjoyed it.  The food there was wonderful and the atmosphere of the southern bayou was REALLY kool.  The firework show that I had been looking forward to got cancelled because of so called ""high altitude winds"" but I still got to see Fantsmic, my favorite show anywhere, and that was well fantastic (no pun intended). That was a great ending to a great day."

"event","Last night I spoke with my friend Paris on the phone till neqarly 2 in the morning.  We really had one of the most incredible, meaningful, and fullfilling conversations I had ever had before.  It started out talking about every day troubles, etc., Eventually that lead into bigger things we talked about God, angels, Jesus, Purgatory, Heaven, Hell, the Church, how to achieve happiness and salvation, and nearly any subject of that nature you can imagine.  Eventually Paris came to an incredible realization that I thought was absolutely beautiful and profound.  She said: ""God did not want to make us be with him, He wanted us to want to be with him.""  Just thought I would share that.  I will leave you with that quote again.

"event","I finnished my ASL project last night, it was actually quite enjoyable.  The assignment was to create a collage about what we like and to write a 1-2 page paper on it in ASL.  I think I learned something about myself that I have never stopped to think about before.  My life is controlled by the media and corperate america.  My collagfe had one picture of my family on it and most of the rest was either pictures of my favorite musicians, television shows such as ""The OC"" and ""Whose Line is it Anyway?"".  There were movie characters such as Jack Skelington, and even several of the ""happiest place on earth"" (the only exception to corperate America as it still holds the magic, but the rest of Disney has cought up to the moral decay of modern society.)  I couldn't believe what I saw in the finnished product, sure it really was abunch of things I liked, but there was not one picture of a friend and only a single picture of my family off on the side somewhere.  Even though I truly think of my friends as the most influent ioal and important people in my life, along with my family, I t really goes to show that we don't put in enought time for the really important things in our society.  It made me think, rather than siting in front of my TV for hours upon end whay not call a loved one and have a real conversation, or spend some quality time with my family?
Just a thought.

"event","I really loathe some of my friends blogs because they are completely melancholy.  Unfortunately I am starting this record of my daily events on a bad note.  I just got over the weekend from Hell.  Last Friday I was having a perfectly beautiful day, I spent the afternoon watching the my favorite movie with some of my very best friends.  I was very rudely interrupted by someone who had heard I said completely awful about him, which was utterly untrue.  So he persisted, maybe wanting to pick a fight, i don't know.  He also began spreading rumors to the whole football team that I am gay.  So I went to play rehearsal on that note.  As you may have been able to guess my rehersal did not go well, I couldn't focus at all, for the first time in my life I was experiencing depression.  I couldn't sleep that night.  The next day I was still completely stressed about the entire situation and decided to do some homework and get my mind off of it. Not only had I forgotten my math book but I also left my reading book for english at school and I was to have a test on it Monday, go figure.  My friend then asked me to go to a carnival with her so I did.  I bought an unlimited ride pass for $23.00 when I got there (all the money in my wallet) and ended up going on like 3 rides, I am glad I went, don't get me wrong. I really did have fun hanging out with my friends but the I am now out of the money I usually feed myself with when I stay at school till 8 at night. Finally when I think everything is gonna be ok I talk to another friend of mine who is on the football team. He tells me that I am the talk of the locker room, everyone wants to kill me, and they think I am gay.  I was soo scared to go to school. Of coarse everything was O.K when I got to school today but still now I feel like shit, for the first time in my life I care about what others think, how sad is that?  Oh well, tomorrow is another day.  Believe me (if you don't already know me), I am usually not like this, I am usually happy as a clam so don't expect all my entries to be like this.  I think I'd like to end each of my entries with a quote that I enjoy so at the end of this you will see today's quote.  Before I go I want to just say how important my friends are to me.  Good friends are few and far between and I am SOOO fortunate to have really great ones.  I would especially like to thank Sam, Danielle, and Korey for helping me out this weekend.  (Even though you were not really involved in this weekend I still think fondly of you too Brandon, Paris, and anyone else who is reading this who is not menioned. Believe me I am sure you will all be included in here at some point. I honestly love my friends with all my heart and I just want them to know that they are the world to me. I really need to get started on the huge amount of HW I have tonight, so I can't continue writing about this dreadful chapter in my life, but hey, if this is the worst thing that ever happens in my life, I would say it was a pretty good life.

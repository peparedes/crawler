"event","I had sex 5 times today, I have a penis of steel. ahahahaa and I didnt have sex with reese, because I broke up with her. I had sex wiv a girl called Lucy, she's hot. Last weekend on saturday night I had my first 3some with two girls, I rang tori straight afterwards to tell her, and she told me never to tell her things like that again....coz i went into detail. I thought she would appreciate knowing everything that has happened to me....well maybe not everything. I'm heaps exhausted, but I have to go work blah. Just think tor, if i hadnt moved to melbourne I would still be obsessing over u and not getting any sex.....so maybe its a good thing I'm here. except maybe if I'd stay in Atown u would have come to your senses and married me and we could have had sex lots *sigh* one can only dream. I dont know where this entries going, its just about sex hmmmm. For a boy who was only recently de-virginised, I sure am obseesed with sex already. I still have a major crush on that person, I just dont know how to handle myself around her, she's so hot and confident, I feel so stupid and lame compared to her. I just want to grab her and kiss her......but I dont. I want to pull her aside grab her by both her arms, look deep into her eyes and tell her i love her.....then kiss her and hope to god she kisses back. But i honestly cant see how she would have any interest in me, beyond friends. she's not with a boy and denies that like every boy likes her, but I cant believe that. I have no chance, and I dont know what the fuck to do. I'd ask tori but her advice will be useless....u see she needs exactly the same advice *wink* maybe kate will help....KKKKAAAATTTTTEEEE HELP ME! I watch her sooooo much, the way she walks, so laid back, her smile oh my god she has this grin that makes me melt, and the way when she's talking her fringe falls infront of her face, and she pushes it back all gracefully. ok in other news, i hate condoms and there should be no such thing as pregnancy. blah."

"event","So I have come to the conclusion that I am going to break up with Reese
Because I have a crush, a big one.....i'm well and truly fucking crushed
Tori is crushed too >_< hehe
But really, this girl she is hot stuff, way out of my league, BUT....she's giving me the right signs
And she says lovely things to me, and she's super sweet, and her smile is wonderful and her eyes are to die for, oh my, listen to me, I think I'm in love! I mean, I really do like Reese, she's lovely and I find her attractive and the sex is good, but thats all. There's no deep feelings or anything, like when your in a room with 'THAT' person, and the room is full of people, but all you see is them. Yeh Reese doesnt do that for me, it just feels like a really good friendship....with benefits haha. But my crush, omg all I ever see in a room full of people is her, all I ever want to do is bump into her, maybe one day get a kiss from her. I think the feelings are returned, sometimes I catch her looking at me, and I only met her a couple of weeks ago and already she txt's me, and asks me to go places with her. I love the feeling of beng in love or lust, whatever it is. When no matter what, that one person makes you smile, and you just feel at peace with the world. I think I'm starting to show my gay side haha I sound like the biggest fag right now, I must leave before it gets worse, advice would be lovely guys....Jesse needs help. xxx"

"event","Welcome to my new Livejournal. Well....okay so it's not quite new, it's my old one that I haven't updated in forever. Well my friends, that is about to change as I now have my own computer and broadband internet. Jesse is back dammit! So I shall write a list of all the things you have missed.

~ I am not returning to RADelaide, my mum sold our house and we have moved here permanently, this was not intended, but conveniently while we were here, mum mangaed to get a nice new well paying job. The temptation was too great. I'm okay with this though because life is good here.
~ I have a well paying steady job at a cd store
~ I have made friends with a new bunch of people and am playing drums in a new band called 'Operative Word'
~ I have a girlfriend of 2 months, her name is Reese and she is a star
~ I have 9 tattoos and counting, I re-pierced both sides of my lip
~ Went on a two week holiday to Bali and ended up staying for 2 months travelling Asia, with my friend Jed
~ Had sex with alot of asian women ahahaha
~ Now as well as work, I go to Tafe and am studying Music - technical production
~ I moved out of Amy (my sisters) house, where it was a little too crowded with baby James and mum
~ I live with Jed and Alex in a house not far from town, we have lots of parties and make heaps of noise
~ I miss my RADelaide crew, every second of every day....Tori, Zack, Damo...come and fucking visit me!"

"event","well its been a while. alot of things have gone on. I'm in melbourne still, fuckin melbourne. and it looks like i'm here for quite a while, like years haha. my sis, she needs alot of help, it's not the short term thing that mum and me assumed it would be. I don't know how I'm going to be able to survive over here. I have no friends, no band, no drums, no best mates that i can do ridiculously stupid things with and no sexy hardcore chick to torture and checkout when she's not looking. I've never had to start fresh before, and i mean mum has said it's not permanent but it'll probably be for quite a few months, i dont know what we're gonna do wiv the house, i guess my aunty and uncle will check up on it and stuff. mum is begging me to go back to adelaide so that i can be happy, but, i can't i need to look after her. To tell you the truth i kinda have made a friend. The local cd shop has a dude called Jed working there and i went there so much that we chatted one day, and he's a cool guy. into all the same stuff as me, tori would like him *winks* nice little hxc boy. and he asked me to come to a local show wiv him and his mates next weekend, kinda gain me sum friends hopefully, he reckons i should apply for a job there too, i think i will, might as well earn sum money to pay for all the mobile credit i'm usin calling torz and damo and zack. but with that money i can also buy a heap of shit car and drive to adelaide and see all my homies yay. haha well i think i might go stare at a wall for a while or....bang pans? we'll see. love u all. jess <3"

"event","The great jesse is back! woohoo!!!
well no not really, I'm in an internet cafe in melbourne. well i guess i should explain myself aye?! Yes the rumours are true, I'm involved in a giant drug smuggling ring and flew to melbourne wiv several kilos of crack shoved up my ass, was sniffed out, cavity serched, arrested and sent to jail. ahahahahhaaa. It's all true. hmmm but really, my step sister from my late fathers first marriage (amy), had her baby boy, james (after my middle name!!!) and mum and me went over there to help out coz the dad ran out on her when she fell pregnant. man it's like a passions episode wiv my family. so yeh anyway, even though my mum isn't actually amy's real mum, they are heaps close and amy's been hell struggling wiv everything so we're over here to help out. Within a week of being here I discovered that crayola crayons, when eaten in large amounts make u very sick and i had my stomach pumped. lovely aye, i had multi coloured vomit lol! Didn't feel too good for about 48 hours, and am currently battling my crayon addiction. but seriously, they taste good. I'm kind of lonely and bored over here, it's great chillin with james, if only could he return the conversation every now and then, instead of screeching and crying, which is contributing to my mass headache and lack of sleep. I'm missing our band and my drum kit so much and both Amy and mum are ready to kill me, apprently it's not acceptable to use kitchen items for a drum kit at 2 in the morning. Well i didnt get the fuckin memo! I went for a walk round melbourne the other day, by myself, how sad haha. and yeh found a music store a couple of blocks away from Amy's house. So went in and they have about 8 drum kits upstairs and I played them for like ages and the dude got a little pissed but I convinced him I was trying them out because I was likely to buy, but I went for the 4th time today and i think he's caught on to the fact that i don't want to buy coz he made me leave, oh well maybe he won't notice when i go 2moro. I really miss damien and tori and zack. I called tori 8 times one night, I think she wanted to fly to melbourne just to kick me in the balls, coz i annoyed her mwahaha. i made her play I Spy on the phone, cept she got all bitchy coz apparently u cant play it over the phone because u can't see all the stuff the other person can. I mean come one, she probably just found it too hard, i even described my room to her, damn drama queen. so anyway, I best be off, coz a creepy old man just sat next to me and i don't think it's coincidence that he just rubbed my foot 3 times. I'm out. should be back b4 xmas, fingers crossed <3 u all. jesse.x.
ps. does anyone wanna be a surrogant mother to my child, i want a baby, they're so cute and fun. oh look now I've gone all clucky. dammit."

"event","jesse is very fuckin tired and needs sleep. friday night was spent playin pool and drinkin at brad's house. Sarah and i hooked up again. hmmm i know i shouldnt wiv her, but hey, theres no one else. tori shall be very disappointed when she finds out. i mean we're all good friends wiv sarah, we love her, but she really is a skank, and i do mean that in the nicest possible way. she's a good person most of the time but yeh....i probably shouldnt get caught up in that side of things. so yeh, kinda disappointed in myself, but i have been lacking in female company for sooo long, its been almost a year since jenny and i broke up, that almost killed me. damn all those beautiful girls who make u fall in love with them and then just leave. alot of people seem to think i'm in love with tori and the truth is, i am. but not in a way that i want a relationship, i mean if the chance came around, i'm not saying i wouldnt go for it but who wouldnt??? But this past year tori has been so fuckin good to me, after all the shit i went through wiv jenny, my dad, everything. she came around at just the right time. you see tori, me, zack and damien all went to primary skool together, cept tori left in year 3. and although we were so young, we were the best of friends. i didnt see her for a long time until about year 7, when our families caught up. and then nothing until one night in october last year, i was at enigma bar, seeing um...i cant remeber...bands lol neways. me damien and zack were leaning against the wall talkin and watchin when this girl walked past. just by seeing her walk, i knew that i knew her from somewhere, and then she turned and smiled to whoever she was talkin to and straight away i knew that smile, and those eyes. so i walked up to her, ""tori?"" and she nodded and looked at me really strangely, tryna figure out who i was. and then u could see her eyes light up and she jumped on me and we hugged for about 5 minutes. At the time, I was going through a rough patch with my gf of a year, jenny and my dad was in hospital with cancer and everything was just way hard for me. and this girl, came out of nowhere and picked me back up and pulled me through it all. The day my dad died, tori was there only weeks after bumping into eachother at enigma bar, and that night we curled up in bed and cried together. i owe tori so much. and i regret the day i got her in contact wiv that evil boy, yep i was the one who introduced them, good one aye jesse?? i almost fricken ruined tori's life. and thats why i put his head through a window, i girl like tori who does fuckin everything in her power to be there for her friend, who never puts herself first in any situation, didnt deserve that. she spent so much time caring for other poeple, she forgot about herself, she got severe depression. everything was so hard for her. But it makes my day just to see her smile and know she's happy. she's finally escaped from all the crap. she has a boyfriend of almost 7 months who she couldnt be happier with, she's in love, she has friends like heather and kate who are mad about her and who she talks about all the time. you know me and tori have never had a fight, like an actual serious one, ever! i dont think i could ever be angry with her, theres no fucking way. anyway i want to use this lj entry to let tori know how many people love her and need her. i know wivout her this past year, i dont know....it wouldnt be good. <b>so I'm asking that all her friends read this and comment or write their own entry, in appreciation of tori, coz sometimes i dont think she gets enough.</b> i love you beautiful.

score!!!!
haha i dont know where all this sex appeal has come from
i am soo sexy sexy sexy SEXXXXXXXY
lol i'm fuckin bored, just sittin around at home
ignoring the pile of homework and every now and then bangin around on the drums
band prac went good sunday night
and tori told mr big shot where he stands and threw a drum stick at the back of his head
it was fuckin classic
this weekend, is shapin up to be a whole lot of boredom
except for the satisfying moment when i will unleash my pretty little 'pet' on tori
ahahahahaaa kate knows wat i'm babbling bout
i got stitches in my head peoples.
me and damo thought it might be interestin to try and bounce from the trampoline to the roof of my house. and let me tell u folks, its not a good idea, especially when u dont get enough height and go full pelt into a wall of house bricks, get knocked out and have to have 6 stitches in the side of the head which then 4 days l8r, burst open and blood and head goo go everywhere. bloody dodgey asain doctor. lol
i talked to tori's bf last night, toby. he seemed pretty cool, very friendly, i decided not to interigate him just yet, and i also refrained from the safe sex talk, but i'll wait till i have them both wiv me in public and then i shall give them the safe sex talk, u guys probably think i'm joking, but as tori would know, jesse doesnt joke mwahahahaa
lovin the used at the moment
big day out line up is irritating me
no punk, emo, screamo
not cool bdo organiser peoples
jesse not happy
but i do want to see slipknot
just minus all the 'metal head' pre pubescent little fags, they're fuckin irritatin
u just wanna smash their heads together

"event","I am going home tomorrow- I am so excited, yet so sad. I think if I had spent the whole year in Boston I might be more ready to go home, but I just feel like I haven't had enough of the city yet. Maybe I never will. 

There is so much here and so little there. I am going to miss the simmons girls so much :french fries and my new found love thanks to ts: honey mustard,Lea(h) sandwiches, my roommate's journal, miss cleo, crossing brookline in a tsunami, fire and ice, the marathon... I'm going to miss it all.

But the good news is I am going home to some of my favorite people in the world- so it will be good to see them. I guess the break from Boston will keep me loving and appreciating it. Oh god, I sound like I am dating the city haha! 


Life is great right now..."

"event","YAY! Laura is gone! woo hoo! I thought this day would never come!!! For anyone that doesn't know who Laura is- she's my really really messy roommate. I don't have to listen to her talk to herself, hog the remote, or watch her have seizures in bed everytime time I wake her up in the morning."

"event","Brandy told me that her dog jessie died. Then I read about in Melinda's live journal too. That's so sad, I loved jessie. Who will my dog have to pee on now with her gone? Does anyone remember that time Jessie bit Julianne Larner's ear?? That was funny. So, that's sad, I loved jessie too. The end comes for everything and everyone, and it was just that time.

On a much happier note, I will be coming home May 2nd. Yup, that's right the second of May. BUT, I have to get all my work done in order for that wonderful dream to come true.

This weekend Pete came to see me and we had so much fun!

Friday- we went to the north end for an amazing dinner and then to Mike's pastries yum yum!

Saturday- we spent the day walking all over the city. at night, we went to fire and ice (the best restaurant ever!!) with michelle and chris and then off to blue man group with them- tons of fun!

Sunday- we all went bowling and to dick's last resort. After that, we went to see eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, which was amazing!

~so much fun stuff this weekend and so much more stuff to look forward to when I get home!! 
(except missing jessie of course.... Mel and Bran, I'm sorry she died)"

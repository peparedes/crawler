I'm sorry I put us in that situation, I'm sorry I tore apart myself at your expense, I'm sorry I destroyed us, if only for a while. I dont regret the short moments of bliss because at the time it was wonderfull, I do regret the circumstance and the consiquences. I'm sorry I scarred the both of us and added more turmoil and baggage to our fucked over teenage lives. I'm sorry we went through so much pain. I'm sorry I ever discovered you, for if I hadnt, none of this would have happened, the good does not override the bad in this case. If I could, I would go back and listen the fuck to christine instead of ignoring her AND my own instincts. I'm sorry I went out of my way to get what I wanted instead of stepping back and realizing it wasnt what I really wanted or needed. I'm sorry I went through that, I'm sorry I'm living with the consiquence. I'm sorry you are still recovering from the cuts and burns, but so am I. I dont want you back in my life, All I want to do is talk to you and realize that I dont care about you, that I dont need you and I dont need to hang on to the memory of my stupidity and keep blaming myself.I want the let go and keep the past in my past.I want you to realize that hanging on to the memory of becky and me and elise is just going to screw you up and cause you more pain. You are 15, you are young and you have chances. You can erase everything, grow up and come to your senses. Until then you have chances, you dont need to cling to the fuck ups. Pick up move on and start over. Scars fade, I hope mine will, I dont need this fogging my vision, I'm over I'm on but I'm not. So I'm sorry I was stupid desperate and pathetic. I want to forgive myself so for now I apologize."

1.holidays
2.school off
3. beth home(like thats not bad enough)
4. whole family under one roof(it gets worse)
5. the parentels and dumb sister decide we should all spend a whole day together
OH GOODY! *twitch twitch* they did this to me over thanksgiving too. THat's it beth is just not allowed tolive here anymore. Stupid crap ass family wanting happy togetherness. LIke I really need to be around them more then I already am....never. It's wake up go to school, go somewhere till night, go home do hw and sleep. Over vacation its wake up go to davids, come home at 11:30 sleep then do it all over again the next day. But that's not good enough for my stupid family. THey wanna spend time with me! and its all beth's fault too. ""let's stay up all night and eat popcorn and talk about boys and do our nails and be the bestest of friend!"" YAY! I'll kill her. Ok she didnt actualy say that but she may as well. Jesus she's out of the house for one year and all of a sudden she wants to be my best fucking friend. Well she missed her chance 10 years ago when she decided by default that I'm an annoying little shit who's not worth treating with any sort of kindness. SHe had her chance but she decided to beat the crap out of me and make fun of me to the point of cruelty and loss of self esteem forever. Yes I blame her for a lot of things because a lot of things are her fault. She deffanitly scared me for life by telling me for many consequtive years how stupid ugly and annoying I am.  So sorry if I dont jump at the chance to hug her and wanna be around her every second of my life, or much wanna talk to her at all."

SO I hear the movie was grand. I must say the image of leesh and laura collapsed on the floor, david looking like a walking corpes and jp sitting their chatting away totally fine was rather amusing, or scary, or both. Yes both we'll go with that. I can just picture all of you in dunken donuts slurring your words and saying the stupidest things in the entire world. DAMN I WISH I HAD BEEN THERE!

I think kenny was in nearly all of them.Then elissa made tea for whoever wanted it which was yummy in my tummy. ABout half an hour into the musical Hair I went to sleep, just couldnt do it anymore. I was awoken this morning to the sound go giggling girls and A HELL OF A LOT OF SNOW! Yummm. Elissa's mom made french toast and scrambled eggs and hot chocolate.Everyone had left by 11:30.

You know that pure exhaustion that when if you dont get to sleep soon you just regress to the age of two and start fidgiting and throwing a hissy fit, yea welcome to me!David thought there was something seriously wrong with me and I was going all phyco depressed. grumble, evertime my emotions go slightly askew the world is going to think that I'll go jump off a bridge or be found still bleeding in the bathtub. Sorry that was a bit graphic I apologize. But seriously I mean I appreciate the concern and everything and I know that you all care about me and dont want anything to happen to me. I just hate the repuation my fucked up head has built up about myself.

Enough of that. So joey's party was intresting. Firstly we watched  Drum line, an ok movie but I've seen it before. Me and david had a long fight for the couch and lost, which ended up in sarah and patrick taking over kenny's van which was even more intresting.Then kenny comes in and asks for a sacrifice. Of course I volonuteered I thought they were going to submit me to some kind of torchure. Turns out they just wanted me to see if they were really in his car. Bah thats no fun. It was so dark in there I couldnt tell. Then kenny sent david out as a scout and eventualy we saw some hand waving to conclude that people were really in there. Then people broke out the flashlights. Now sarah and patrick are rather pissed.So I went away but from what I hear other people kept at it.Me and david finally gained control of the couch but then christine emma and shannon just sat on us.The started poking and prodding me ceaselessly so I lost it. I got up, walked to the other room and sat in a corner. For the love of god all I wanted to do was sleep a little but noooooooooooooo. Stupid god damn people had to poke me. Then I got all fidgity and spasaming and annoyed and frusterated. Sarah and patrick came back. Sarah was glaring at me and david bieng most pissed off. Patrick didnt seem to be as affected.Parents came eventualy and took me and david home.

Oh yea david had the life sucked out of him yesterday. He gave blood. Giant needles centimeters thick jabbed into his arms. The nurse fucked up the first time and they had to do a second time in his other arm.*twitch* They drew a bag and four viles. God damn thats a lot of blood.His arms were rather sore. I hope he's feeling better by now.OK I'm gonna go be productive, byebye"

"event","It's funny how giving someone else advice can end up being really good advice for you.People should realize this more often. But anyway I was talking to one of my friends last night online and she was saying how confused about life she is and she doesnt know what to do or how to feel, after a while of me trying to convince her of something which failed because I change the way she thinks so I told her to take a break. Spend  a day for herself. Just relax and reflect, stay in bed for how ever long she feels like, eat whatever she wants and do whatever she wants, but just relax. Then I signed off and realized that thats a really damn good idea. Whenever overly confused or stressed always take a personal day. So today my friends is MY personal day. Just sitting around my house in ""sweet release"" to qoute jp, reading, eating, sleeping, drawing, watching anime, and eventualy doing something with one of my life long friends. *content smile* 
*hugs to all of you* love you all very very much!"

So in my head I've finished the book....yea yea I know. They probably wont test us this week cause jeez there's only three days in the week so I've got the weekend. Saturday I have the entire house to myself because both my parents are going out of town, the only reaso I'm staying is because of colorgaurd practice. School starts tomorrow oh yay I can hardly wait. Beth is now at her dorm and I have moved into her room which is happy and fun because I like her room better then mine. THough its not my room and doesnt feel like my room so its not entirely comfortable but I'll get used to it considering its upstairs and ah the privacy. I went insane sunday night. I was at jp's party which was loads of fun by the way, and laura was having me pull her back on the swing as far as my little body could withstand so she would get a good lift off, I lost my balance and fell over I sat there for a few minutes and then burst out laughing histeracly for no damn reason and I couldnt stop, I literally could not stop. Yea I'm insane and damn well aware.Aside from the me leesh and jess had a lesbian threesome on the trampoline while calling out to david and laura once.I was pretending to have an orgasm when jess bounced right next to me which caught me off gaurd and I shrieked, Just imagine ""aah ahh ahh *insert blood curdling scream here*"" it was too perfect. then there were the numerous pig piles of funness with everybody layingon the trampoline in the center on top of eachother because the thing sags towards the middle so everyonejust gravitates that way.It was good fun. oo oo I saw ocean's 11 too great movie.last night david me jenny and mark fitzjerald watched movie's at steve owens's house.First it was muppet treasure island because we are all massive losers who love the muppets. ""SAILING FOR ADVENTURE ON THE BIG BLUE WET THING"" anyway.Next it was FIGHT CLUB, I had to leave before I saw the ending from what I did see its very good but insanely depressing. Kinda sent me into a low on top of a low cause i was already feeling icky cause thats what I do. I'm good now. THis is hwy I like sleep, you go to sleep upset and wake up happy. SLeep good it hided my emotions from my concious and then I am happy. So yes I'm off to get my assignment notebook for school now. I hear its annoying because they put the handbook in the back."

Somedays you look in the mirror and for some unknown reason.........you dont look like you did yesterday and tomorrow you'll be back to normal. What is that? Is it a reflection of your emotions at that time. Do I feel different? I suppose I do a bit but I cant put my finger on it. Summer is basically over...school is going to start again soon and everything will return to normal. The whole of us will meet in the mornings at the lockers go to class's and then be back at the locker's afterschool again. Time elude's me all the time. I suppose I feel as though I'm about to make a transition and its just very bizare. I dont feel the same I did in the middle of july, then I had this thought in my head that so much freedom lay ahead of me and I had so much time to do whatever I pleased.That's all gone now, I've been spending six hours a day at the highschool and even though I'm not really at school summer feels so dead to me. It doesnt feel like summer anymore but I'm not in school so I'm just kind of floating here with no set deffanition of what I'm living. Is that why?
could be....did I just jump some huge milestone in my life but I totaly missed it? I dunno. I anylyse myself too much.You know wahts great? I managed to confuse even my therapist. That amuses me. Well what he was confused about was why my parents had described me as a person with well developed opinions and a strong sense of self but around him i'm very shy and conservative. Hmmmmm maybe because I dont know you and I have to basically tell you my life story and everything about me. In general I just dont like new people anyway. New people make me nervous because I dont know if they're going to like me, I suppose you could say I'm a very cautious person, I suppose. So I do beleive I've rambled long enough for tonight, I should be getting to bed soon, gotta be up by two pm tomorrow oh gosh thats just so darn early aint it?"

Luckily david was here till 10 so was ryan (beth's fiance, beth is my sister) so beth me ryan and david all hid in my room watching movies. First it was lord of the rings then it was resident evil. My grammy and grandaddy were here too but only for dinner aka beth's birthday celebration even though her birthday was yesterday. My uncle steve is here too he's leaving in the morning though. My grammy hugged david when he first came in. Tee hee she's so cute I love my grammy. David shook everyone else's hand. Grammy told me she likes him hee hee.Grandma just kinda said hello. BItch woman........It was a pretty good day till my grandma showed up which was 7 she was supposed to be here yesterday at 5:30 for beth's actual birthday but she decided to go to shool instead. She does this everysingle year. Every year she's had an exuse not to come to beth's birthday, she didnt come to mine because she had someone's batmitzva to go to. BITCH LADY. Even david agreed he'd get annoyed with her and he'd been saying that she cant be that bad. HAH show him. Durring dinner me and ryan had to come in the house because we dont like people. I was actualy getting an anxiety attack from being with people ryan just doesnt like lots of people. Heh Grandma even missed the cookout/party thing. SHe come's in and starts talking about something and beth misunderstood what she said and grandma turns to me and says ""molly waht did you think I said"" like she was trying to justify herself and proove what she had said. SHe has issues.SHe's staying till monday and I refuse to deal with her. Beth is leaving for ryan's house tomorrow for a few days. I'm going to david's tomorrow for the reason of escaping her.MOnday I have steve robinson at ten till eleven then I think I'm going somewhere with david and then rookie day at 2 till 8. By the time I get home bitch lady should be gone.So basically I never have to deal with her if I play my cards right. For the love of god if one of her son fucking hides from her that has to say something. My uncle even (dad's brother) hides up in his room or is out of the house on purpose when he knows his mother is going to be over. btw uncle steve is my mom's brother just to clarify. David said he was really cool guy. I'm happy he likes my family. Grandma doesnt count because no one likes her including her children. Well my dad puts up with her, he's probably the most loving of her children and she only see's him maybe three times a year.gah she piss's me off so much. I cant explain it you'd have to know her to understand. David only talked to her for a few seconds and could already understand why we dislike her so much. I was paranoid the whole day I kept looking out the window to see of she had arrived yet so I could have a little warning on how much time I had before the evil crossed the threshold. It was a decent day though. We all had fun. Excepting when beth and I had to go out and greet the dirty wench. Meh I'll see you all on monday if you're going to be at rookie day if not then tuesday it is."

I've decided there arent enough hours in my day so I was attempting to be awake for more of them but judging from the fact that I stay up really late and dont get anything productive done durring the night its a very futile attempt and if I even try now I'm only going to get two hours of sleep which is not enough for me to run on and my coffee high hasnt run out yet which is really bad because I may never get to sleep on teh bright side I will get that whole more hours in a day thing but this isnt quite what I was going for.I was supposedto be asleep two hours ago when I got off the phone withdavid but noooooooooo I was stupid and drank coffee. It wasnt even real it was instant coffee and only about 20% was actualy caffinated because I ran out and had to use decaf. So it was really really weak coffee with lots of milk.

I remember her but I cant remember where I remember her from. I hate that. When I can't remember something but it's right there I just can't grasp it. grrrrrrrrrr annoyance's annoyance's. I'll survive. 

Bwah haa haa I'm in my sanctuary and I love it. Utter darkness ignoring the computer glare of warmth and friendship. You heard me my computer is my friend. My manga and knitting is my friend too. I live a sad exhistance and I'm not afraid to state it. I actualy turned down being with a bunch of my friends yesterday so i could sit in front of my computer reading sp. Oh there's another question, leesh I need new webcomics to spend my time getting up to date with. But not ones that were started six years ago. Three years at the most I dont have that much free time. I still havent gotten through half of my summer reading. If I'm going to spend my days alone I should at least be doing something productive shouldn't I? like playing my guitar or reading something that doesnt read from right to left and have pictures. I'm such a lazy fuck when the hell am I going to get all this reading done. Now sounds like a start but come on give me one more night alone with my precious baby. I love you computer and dont let anyone else ever tell you otherwise.

I love being alone but when given the situation I love being with tons and tons of people constantly having fun and when taken out of that situation it's hard to be alone again cause I'm not alone anymore I'm lonely. It's easier to be alone so I think thats why I take some sort of pleasure in it. Of course sometime's the effort of being with people is worth it though when there is no amount of effort that can be put forth to allow you to find people and that's really painfull to deal with at first. Then I sink back into my world of night and computer glowage and I feel right at home all over again. So do I not like being alone? but I do it anyway? gak I confuse myself to levels of extreme confudlement."

I could just start over with the bigger needles but then would waste all the work I did yesterday. meh whatever we'll see what happens.

I understand.it's weird to think about, that it's just so different now and painfull different for you. Change is possiably one of the most bizare things in life, its so common because everything is constantly changing but those are the little things, people only take notice when it largely affects their lives and then.....then we reflect and wonder ""what now?"" and for a while we're very confused and lost feeling that this different life is horrible because its strange and unknown. But the only thing that can be done is just keep going and instead of wondering whats going tohappen go ahead and find out. Keep living because thats all we can do.Obviously everybody keeps living but it's that state of mind that makes us feel as though we're actualy moving forward.Thats what needs to be reattained after a great disturbance in our live's occurs.

You're all so smart you get a cookie now cept not cause I dont have any cookies. Anyway I got back from woodshole today. I know I said ten days but apparently david didnt quite relay information to his mommy correctly so I only stayed till wednesday. It was so much fun. Lots of running around barefoot contra/swing dancing sing alongs fire frisbee matches republicans dehydration night swimming and attempting to make chocolate mousse at 9:30pm. Oh and I learned to knit and then I did it for six hours straight three of which I sat in the same damn chair.I miss it. I got home today and felt so incrediably suffocated. THis town is so dead compared to woodshole. There's so much freedom, all the parents know eachother and the kids so the kids can just run around till all hours of the night. I had to put on shoes today and I was like what the hell is this my feet are constrained, it was highly uncomfortable. I also really miss david alot.I hate when that happens, somethings so constantly there something thats so incrediably good then with in two hours its gone. Ripped from your life for three more weeks. I also just got so used to the lifestyle of woodshole and now its back to the endless nights on my computer in the dark on the phone with david if he ever calls. You know every other four days. *shrug*  I shall live. Quite well actualy. Summer's almost over, that is so incrediably depressing. I still havent done my summer reading. Shizballs.........oh well it'll get done in do time. So I'll read religiously from now till david get's home and that'll get me through life. Cause well I'll be living someone else's life wont I?

Any way me and leesh have been watching Evangelion well we only watched the first seven episodes.I started falling asleep because I was really tired. But I've woken up, we were fucking around on the computer with pond boy aka that kid who I had the conversation with that was posted a few hours ago. So we've been hangin out talking being bored and warding off evil evil bugs. No there was this absolutly disgusting thing flying around my room.It went into the folds of my curtains so I sprayed the curtains with water poked it with a hanger and smushed the curtains inbetween a big book.IF that bug is still alive I will be so impressed.Or you know really pissed because I want it dead NOW!!!!!!!!!!! gross nasty bugs need to die all of them.

I am currently on my new/old compaq laptop because my sister got a dell desktop so I have finaly disposed of my evil mac which makes me very very happy. Pc's are just prettier and now I can see the internet the way normal people do instead on my crappy mismatched resolution mac. TEE HEE, is amused, can you tell. Zachary for you when you come home HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY!!!!!!! *hug* I love you sorry I wasnt here on your b-day.

love y'all see you later"

"event","It's a combination of Zach and Bono... and Angela, who is a blemish on Leesh's past. Oh, and this is Leesh typing for Molly. ^_^ Hello. So here's the convo that Molly would like copied and pasted here.

Makaveli8587: you have a friend who is planning to get drunk with a senior on friday night because she thinks it will make all her problems go away and after 20 minutes of explaining to her why it's wrong she still has lame excuses and plans on doing it
Makaveli8587: do you A. not do anything
Makaveli8587: B. keep talking to her
Makaveli8587: C. tell her parents about what she's done with the senior and what she will do with this senior friday night
faerybliss48: B
Makaveli8587: okay
Makaveli8587: B didn't work
Makaveli8587: now what do you do
faerybliss48: C
Makaveli8587: thank you
Makaveli8587: cause i tried B and it didn't work
faerybliss48: though you might lose your friend
Makaveli8587: and for some reason, everyone is telling me not too
Makaveli8587: yes, i accept that
Makaveli8587: it's beyond friendhip
Makaveli8587: i'm doing this to save a 14 (yes, 14) year old's life
faerybliss48: okay
Makaveli8587: i'm doing this out of my love for her
Makaveli8587: and if she can't see that then that's okay
Makaveli8587: but i want to protect her from ruining her life
faerybliss48: good luck
Makaveli8587: maybe i'm just crazy
Makaveli8587: trying to save a life
Makaveli8587: caue i probably can't do that
faerybliss48: it's good to try
Makaveli8587: but you always hear about how people get drunk then go for a drive and end up dead
Makaveli8587: what you never hear about is the one person who is kicking themself in the ass crying because they didn't do everything within their power to stop them
faerybliss48: nod
Makaveli8587: i refuse to be that person
Makaveli8587: not for myself
Makaveli8587: but for her
faerybliss48: ok
Makaveli8587: she's so smart
Makaveli8587: she has one of the best futures you could possibly want laid out for her
Makaveli8587: she's the best person in the world
Makaveli8587: i refuse to let her throw away her life like that without fighting against her about it
Makaveli8587: maybe someday she'll thank me
Makaveli8587: maybe she wont
Makaveli8587: i dont care
Makaveli8587: it's not about me
Makaveli8587: it's about her
faerybliss48: yop
Makaveli8587: i've lost one friend because of this belief
Makaveli8587: but i dont care
Makaveli8587: this is bigger then some stupid ""it takes just a little bit of this to get over"" shit
Makaveli8587: this isn't time we're talking about 
faerybliss48: nod
Makaveli8587: this is somethign that changes peoples lives forever
faerybliss48: this is true
Makaveli8587: show me one person that had free sex and alchohal and drugs throughout high school
Makaveli8587: and turned out okay
Makaveli8587: i'll show you an entire shelter of people who did all that
Makaveli8587: and didn't turn out okay
faerybliss48: ok
Makaveli8587: this is life
Makaveli8587: this isn't some little stupid thing to be fuckin around with anymore
Makaveli8587: when we were in elemetary school we could fool around because we would never do drugs or sex or alchohal
Makaveli8587: the worst we could do was steal a penciel from taylors
Makaveli8587: it's bigger now
Makaveli8587: this affects our future
Makaveli8587: it's like throwing a rock into a pond
Makaveli8587: it may seem like a tiny and small pebble
Makaveli8587: but the water ripples, and has aftershocks to that one tiny pebble
Makaveli8587: we have to be so careful about how we live our lives from here on out
Makaveli8587: because the pond is our lives
faerybliss48: yea I got that
Makaveli8587: and every little thing that is placed in the pond affects it for better or worse
Makaveli8587: i just wish people understood that
faerybliss48: yea...........

Auto response from Makaveli8587: we are nothing more then ponds

Makaveli8587: whatever, i'm just 15
Makaveli8587: what do i know?
Makaveli8587: anyways i'm gonna go
Makaveli8587: goodnight
faerybliss48: bye

"event","bored.......Bored........BOred......BORed.......BOREd.......BOOOOOOOORED!!!!!!!!!! ack the ickyness of a cloudy rainy friday stuck inside with absolutly nowhere to go. I'm awaiting the arrival of 4pm. Thats when david's father is comming to drive me down to woodshole where I shall spend the next 6days. It was origianally ten days but david's mom decided against. David was pissed but whatever time is time and any time with him is good enough for me.

so yea today is going to be avery very long and boring as all hell kinda day. i wonder what zach's up to? probably off with laura sushi and danielle. but you know what life is really really good. I'm really happy  I feel as though this huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders and now I'm just basking in the after glow. wish it were a sunnier day that would make things seem a little more exciting around here. I could read but thats just no fun and boring too. I was never one for sitting on my ass for hours at a time with a book. pfft I'd rather be living my own life then living someone elses. I dont know how people just get so absorbed in a book that they'll just sit there for days on end missing meals and not sleeping till four in the morning. fuck man its just a book. People confuse me. The only thing that interests me in reading for long periods of time is brit books aka books written by britts because those have the quirky sense of humor thats just great.Well I suppose its not that I would abore reading right now its just that I'd rather be reading something other then my summer reading but I havent started yet and  I'm a slow reader so basically I'm fucked. I'd much rather be reading rhapsody but nooo its A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY oooh how exciting. Well sadly that book is better then THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING, *shudder* I do not enjoy the writing style of that crap. *ducks from the blows of jess* she's going to maim me when she reads this. Oh well. Yesterday was my last day of art lessons *tear* but I'll still be working for her when she comes back from her vacation so its all good. Well zach just signed on so i'm going to harrass him now. I'm sure I'llpost again later just to express my sheer boredem."

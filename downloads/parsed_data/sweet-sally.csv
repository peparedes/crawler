"event","Sunday:
 A day for realxing around my house. I remember when I was younger that my grandma and grandpa would always tell me not to work on Sundays. They would sit on the porch and people would drop by and visit them off and on all day long.
Well, things are different now. Grandpa has passed and Grandma is in the nursing home, but, I still take their advice for Sundays being my day to relax . However now that I am a wife and mother, I find that ""realxing"" consists of catching up on laundry and house celaning. I make sure to play with the babies and spend at least an hour on our front porch.
 Sunday dinner varies, but we like to have a good old ""country"" dinner consisting of fried chicken,mashed potatoes and gravy,green beans,corn,home-made biscuits, and a few deserts.
So- this leads me to a question:
What is your idea of a good old ""Sunday Supper""?

well, I will run for now, but will be back soon.
Love,
Sally"

"event","Today is going wonderful. Our oldest daughter ffrom Florida and her husband are up. She will be having her first baby sometime this month and we are getting ready to go shopping and out to lunch.
 It is funny how having a baby can bring you so much closer together. Before this, I never really had anything in common with her, but this visit I feel like we have gotten closer and finally have something that we can both relate to. Sometimes it is just nice to talk to someone who has been through some of the same things that you have ya know?
 I hope that your weekend was great. I do have some wonderful ideas in store and plan on catching you in chat tonight if you are in there.
My Love,

 Please forgive me for not posting in so long. So much has been going on and even though I think about posting on here every day somehow I just never seem to make it in her to do it. 
 I think that most of you know tha I have a husband and three children. One soon -to-be- teenager, an elementary child, and a wee little toddler who keeps me on my toes from day light to dark.
 My husband gets a little sick sometimes, and his health is a little worse in the colder months for some reason. SO- things have been a little busy. I am sorry.
 I WILL post on here a lot more if you will just stick with me.
Well, Thanksgiving is coming up. Do you have plans? Family? Friends? Food?. Busy time of the year I know. I have already been cooking tonight and it is Sunday.
So- I am sure that you will all have the traditional Thanksgiving Dinner right?
I have something that may be a little different: if your family has a tradition or strange food that you all eat. Tell me about it. I'd love to find out a little about you!
Until tomorrow,

"event","Subject: The Rooster

              John the farmer was in the fertilized egg business. He had several hundred young layers (hens), called pullets and eight or ten roosters,
              whose job was to fertilize the eggs.

             The farmer kept records and any rooster that didn't perform 
went into the soup pot and was replaced.
             That took an awful lot of his time so he bought a set of 
tiny bells and attached them to his roosters. Each bell had a different tone 
so John could tell from a distance, which rooster was performing.
 Now he could sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency report simply by 
listening to the bells.

             The farmer's favorite rooster was old Butch, a very fine 
specimen he was, too. But on this particular morning John noticed 
old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all!
            John went to investigate. The other roosters were chasing pullets,
             bells-a-ringing. The pullets, hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover.

           But to Farmer John's amazement, Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the
             next one.             
John was so proud of Butch, he entered him in the county fair and Butch
             became an overnight sensation among the judges. The result...
The judges not only awarded Butch the ""No Bell Piece Prize"" but 
they 
also awarded
            him the ""Pulletsurprise"" as well.

             Clearly Butch was a politician in the making. Who else but a politician could figure out how to win two of the most highly coveted 
awards on our planet by being the best at sneaking up on the populace 
and screwing them when they weren't paying attention?"

LOl- we live in a small town and when the water dept hooked up the fire hose to the hydrant everyone and their brother had to stop and check things out! - love this little town I swear!
 Then yesterday I officially hurt my toe once again. I have broken it over and over, but had ""stobbed it up"" about four weeks ago, well, like I said I did it again!! 
 As you can see not much is going on, but, I still like to let you know what is happening with me. Looks like everyone knew the answer to the silly manhole cover question:) oh well- seemed good at the time:)
 This weeks quick pic was a request for someone who wanted a wet set. I am going to do you some outside shots this weekend and I am going to try to work myself up to doing some video clips for you too.You know how shy I am with that darned video camera!
 well- I will be in touch again and see if maybe I can catch anyone on the cam one evening too.
My Love To You,
Sweet Sally"

"event","Today is Saturday, I just wanted to say hi and wish you all a wonderful weekend. Looks like we have another hurricane on our hands. Emily this time. Is it headed towards any of you? If so my prayers are with you.
 I heard a silly question and want to know if you might know the answer:
Why are manhole cover round instead of square?
Silly question I know- but I would like to hear what you think:)

"event","Dennis has slowed down a bit, but is giving us lots of rain and gusty winds. I hope that everyone is safe. I will be on-line tomorrow night for my webcam show as far as I can tell.

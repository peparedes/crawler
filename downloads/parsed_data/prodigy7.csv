"event","this might be a little meean but i think it needs to be said

Lets review whata codependent means-  a person, role or thing that controls a majority of your life, such as your emotions, your actions, and your attitude. all but one are unhealthy and that one is God. the rest mainly destroy your life.  Cassie and liz. i understand that you want to help him, but you have become obsessed to the point where he is your codependent or his prob is. i might not have any room whatsoever to be talking, but from my observations, he seems to be as much a part of you as you are a part of yourself.  you need to realize that no matter what you do to help, there's only so much that will and the rest is up to God."

"event","it seems as tho the entire world worries
this leaves me to ask the question ""Why?"" (sorry cassie if this is not gramtically correct)
and i'll answer this question too
oh wait, i don't know why
you don't have to agree with circumstances but accept them.
by the way, im not talking to you
you just think i am 
and this prooves my point that everyone worries
and everyones heard these points but yet you still do
and then when there's nothing to worry about 
you worry about worrying"

"event","if the universe was chaotic and made no sense then we would not know it was senseless, for we are part of the universe. and you can't make sense of something senseless, thats why we call some things senseless.  but since we have enough sense to think about whether or not the universe makes sense proves that it does because we are apart of the universe and we have some sense of sense

just the fact that human can think proves that there's a creator that has a plan."

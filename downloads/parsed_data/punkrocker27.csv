"event","Hey everyone.

I have a NEW journal - <lj user=writingasong>. 

So if any of you still want to keep in contact or be friends, just add me over there and be sure to let me know you added me. I promise there will be lots of updates in this new journal once I get started. I just needed a fresh start. I was getting so sick and tired of this username as well.

I hope to see you all over there.

I'm keeping this journal, but won't be writing in it. Thanks! :]"

"event","<b>Jesus, I pray
Take all my mistakes
Throw them away
Destroy them for my sake

Jesus, I call out 'cause I'm sorry
Because I fall so short of your glory
To the best of my ability
I'm practicing humility
And I lay myself before
'Cause less is more

All that I have
I lay before
With my pride on the floor
Cause to you less is more
All that I have
I lay before
With my pride on the floor
Cause to you less is more

I pour out myself
All that I am
You love me so much
That you fill me again
And may these words on my heart, on my lips
Somehow mean so much more than this

Jesus, I pray
Know what I'm trying to say

All that I have
I lay before
With my pride on the floor
'Cause to you less is more
All that I have
I lay before
With my pride on the floor
Cause to you less is more

I pour out myself, before you were Lord
I hold nothing back, 'cause to you less is more
And may these words on my heart on my lips,
Somehow mean so much more than this

Jesus, I pray
Just know what I'm tryin' to say

Jesus, I plead
Please purify me
Make my heart clean
Drench me with your mercy
Jesus, I pray
I love you, I need you
For the rest of my days
I swear I will seek you
To the best of my ability
I'm practicing humility
And I lay myself before
'Cause less is more.</b>

I love this song with a passion.
Everytime I need a little boost, I listen to this.

Just comment saying so.

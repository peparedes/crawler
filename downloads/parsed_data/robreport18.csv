"event","After I finished working Friday night at the video store renting out copies of Fahrenheit 9/11 and Soul Plane, I got home to see the replay of the presidential debate from St. Louis.  It may have been the single most hilarious moment in U.S. history when Dubya found it he had a timber company.  ""I own a timber company?  News to me. (long pause as he tries to think of something clever to say) Need some wood?? (snicker, then realization that nobody was laughing.)""  We must get George W. Bush out of the white house.  I urge both of the people who may read this to get out and vote on Nov. 2nd and get anyone else out there to vote too.  One hour of your Tuesday will have an effect on the next four years and beyond.  We must get this smug, incompetent, naive to a fault, lying retard out of Washington.  Now John Kerry may not be the most charismatic figure, or a guy who you could have fun with at the bar, but that's not what we need in a president.  We need a president who is smart, has the ability to see both sides of an issue, and not demean others when they have that opinion, and who can coherently speak about foreign and domestic issues.  Kerry Can.  Bush Hasn't, Can't, Won't and never will.  

On a lighter side, I did spend all over Sunday watching football and playing Star Wars Battlefront with my brother at his pad.  Sometimes you need to do that.  I laughed when I killed a wookie.

And finally, I live alone.  Do not shed tears for me though.  While I'm sure I may miss some things about Tara, I won't miss her clothes strewn about the common area, the TV set to lifetime, the fact that she never wakes up when her alarm goes off, and the readily available copies of Bon Jovi CDS and Dawson Creek DVDs.  So I'm all by myself in my house.  I've got a room that's clear that I don't know what to do with.  I could make a showcase for all my antiques, but I don't think I have any antiques.  Hmmmm, anyone want to go antiqueing???  Maybe I'll put a bunch of mattresses and pillows down like one of those rockstars room that just a big bed.  But what would I use that for??  Oh, I know!! I'll turn that room into a home gym!!!  Wait, the orgy room seems more plausible.  Out like trout."

"event","OK, laugh, get it out of the way now, but as of this moment in time, the second such span in my short life, I am obsessed with SBTB.  What is SBTB you naively ask?  It just may be the greatest television show EVER!!  The show that brought such promising young talent as Lark Voorhies, Anne Tremko, Dennis Haskins, and the original MPG, Mark-Paul Gosselar.  And of course the Diamond in the rough.  Don't know?? It's all right, cuz I'm Saved by the Bell.  Following last week's purchase of SBTB:TCY or Saved by the Bell: The College Years to the lay person, I have been questing to find the truths of our favortie six-some, sometimes five-some (the Tori episodes) as they journey from an Indiana middle school to Bayside high school to the campus of California University.  I'll ask the tough questions.  Get to the bottom of every important Bayside issue.  And unravel the truth about the issue that our buddies never seemed to tackle: SEX. 

So let's first study the relationships on SBTB.

ZACH and KELLY

Beginnings: When first entering Bayside high there was a love triangle between as cheerleader Kelly Kepowski was torn between blond big shot Zack Morris, and mulleted wrestler AC Slater.  As the boys fought over the girl next door, it seemed as though Slater had the upperhand, getting Kelly to be his dance partner as they teamed to be the Spandex Twins.  (Zach and Jesse were the Preppies, but Screech and a hobbled Lisa won the contest doing ""the sprain"".  It never quite caught on.)

Paradise found:  When Kelly was forced to choose her date for the prom, she did end up picking our blond hero.  A bummed Slater didn't sulk for too long, but we'll get to that later.  However, as Kelly's father lost his job, she didn't have money to buy a new dress, and told Zack she couldn't go.  A dejected Zack wouldn't take no for an answer though, and in sweats and jeans took Kelly to their own personal prom.  They kissed and America had it's favorite Saturday Morning couple.  Now after all Zack did for Kelly, you think he woulda hit that right there and then, but it was a very G-rated kiss, and they just slow danced the credits away.  Did Zack and Kelly fuck?  We'll answer that a little later.

Paradise lost: When Kelly began working at the Max, she became attracted to her boss, a college student (from Michigan, BTW!!) named Jeff.  Since sexual harassment was not a big issue back then, considering a college guy was hitting on a supposedly 15 or 16 year old after hours as they wiped down the Max, they shared a kiss that sent Kelly running, and the Audience ""ooooooing"".  She confessed to Zack that she had feelings for Jeff and their relationship was over...for now.

Sexual Tension: Even after the enivitable Jeff-Kelly fallout that occured at the 18 and up club ""The Attic"" Zach and Kelly didn't immediatly get their engines running.  But there was some tension that continued throughout their years.  They got it on at Jesse's father's wedding in Palm Springs, but Zack then hooked up with Stacy Kerosi at the Malibu Sands resort.  And even though they weren't going out with each other at the time, Zach was able to talk Matt Wilson from taking Kelly to the senior prom so he could go with her instead.  

Ending: When Kelly unexpectedly attended CU in SBTB:TCY Zach was romancing the blond Leslie, yet still managed to find time to suck face with Kelly in her first episode, they were off and on that entire year, complicated by Leslie and Kelly's affair with their 32 year old anthoropology professor Jeremiah Lasky.  Yet as SBTB limped towards cancellation the writers knew some conclusion must've been made, and the Zack-Kelly proposal, marraige, suprise visit by Lisa, and subsequent TV Movie Saved by the Bell:Wedding in Vegas were rushed to the forefront.

Sooo...did Zach and Kelly do it?  Though we never even saw them french kiss, I am forced to believe that Zach and Kelly had to have made it.  A lady's man like Zach doesn't buy the car without test driving it for free, even it is Kelly.  They went to the prom, they were in a hotel together in Palm Springs, they were at college, they fucked.  End of story.  In SBTB:TCY Kelly admits that ""Zack was the first guy I kissed"" then ""I mean, REALLY kissed."" before she is stopped by a grossed-out Leslie.  I'm sure she would've said more had she not been halted.

If you want to post your own thoughts about Z + K please feel free. I've got to stop the conversation know as I ready myself to rent Ella Enchanted to 36 year old men just hoping to see the glimpse of Anne Hathaway in a low cut dress.  Yow-za!  More when i get the chance."

"event","For the last fucking time, I don't have any copys of Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen!!! I swear if I hear one more pre-pubescent girl ask me that I may snap their braided little heads off their bodies.  And don't get me started on 13 Going on 30.  That movie sucked more than a hoover vacuum convention that's run by porn fluffers co-sponsered by the L.A. Clippers.  That really sucks.

Here's a question: When is it okay or is it never okay for the open door piss policy?  I mean, I pee with the door open most of the time.  It's short, it's brief, and I really don't think anyone wants to look anyway.  It is obviously different for guys than girls, but if it's two close people say girlfriend/boyfriend or husband/wife what's the big deal.  My old girlfriend would never go to the bathroom with the door open even if she wasn't in view.  I didn't mind I told her.  She was okay with me doing it, just not the other way around.  And it's not look we were just going out, this was 2 years into the relationship.  People get married quicker.  Listen, guys will pee in front of 30 strangers into a troff at a sporting event, so why can't we pee in front of our mates? Now, by no means should you ever have the door open when doing number 2.  That borders on mental health issues.  You don't even want to be on the same side of the house when that happens.

I love Room Raiders so much right now.  It's the same episode everytime, and they all act the same EVERY TIME.  When I girl finds I guy's porno, the guys always act so shocked.  Like, have you never seen the show before??  Or what did you expect her to find, this is your room??  Or that everybody makes seem weird assumption, like, ""OK, so you have this Batman figure, so you must still be a child, or maybe you work with children, or maybe you have children, or maybe you've fathered dozens of children all over the country with a plethora of homeless women, and then leave them without giving your address thereby single-handedly raising the number of unwed mothers on welfare and destroying America's after-school programs for one-parent children.""  No, its just a Batman figure.

Apparently that was in my brain, and now it's out.  Do what you want with it.  I'm gotta go pee.  With the door OPEN."

"event","The time of the year has come to when my mother and Catherine Adams our beloved musical director are frantically searching for a show to put on in the fall.  It's always a great time because it's stressful, harrowing, and good for some laughs.  There have been some terrible ideas and some good ones as well.  But it's much more fun to discuss the terrible scenarios.  So I've decided to come up with a list of the worst possible ideas for Northern's fall Musical.

Grease!- While undoubtably tickets for this would sell, Grease has to be my all-time least favorite show.  And why it gets played over and over in high schools, I will never know.  Does anyone realize how inappropiate this show is for teens??  Take for example the rousing chorus number ""Greased' Lightning!"".  The song basically describes how girls will get all hot and bothered by the fixing up of a car.  Are any ladies getting turned on out there?  Apparently ""the chicks will cream"" for this vehicle.  That's quite an impressive auto.  Not to mention that it's ""a real p*ssy wagon"".  These are actual lyrics from the song.  Also, a main plot point is that the slut, Rizzo, is ""late."" Late for what?? Hmmm.  Late for glee club practice??  She might be late for biology class, god knows she didn't understand what unprotected sex with a guy named Kenicke (sp?) would do to her.  And what kind of names are these?? Rizzo?? Kenicke?? Frenchy?? Doody?? Are these teenagers or muppets? It sounds like a three year old named the characters.

Hairspray- I heard a rumor that someone thinks that Por No is doing Hairspray as they're musical.  Obviously whoever said this has no idea how shows get produced.  First of all, correct me if I'm wrong, but Hairspray is currently running on Broadway, no?  If it's running it's first run on Broadway it can't be done until it closes, or it's been a really long time.  That's why Les Mis and Cats just became available a few years ago.  And we live in Portage.  Portage Northern High School does not have a big african-american population in its school, especially not in its Arts program.  And Hairspray's cast is at least one third black.  Why would a school in Portage do a show where that much of the ensemble is black??  Gee, that's a mystery.

Joseph and the Amazing blah blah blah-- Now I like Joseph.  I didn't like how it got modernized and all Donny Osmond-ish in the 90s.  And while this show would also sell very well to the families in southwest Michigan, I don't think that the girls at our school would be too happy about it.  Let's face it, this upcoming year we are lacking in experienced boys, and Joseph has 11 brothers, a pharoah, potipher, and the lead character, I forget his name.  There is one, yes one, substantial female role.  We know where the bread and butter is and though I love our guys, they are not gonna take over the show this year.

On a side note, I'd really love to see High School Musical posters done up like movie posters.  Put the kids names out there.  Put a tagline on it.  Have quotes from reviewers, stuff like that.  Just imagine how last year's show would've looked.  I think something like this...

"event","Michigan can be really beautiful in the summer.  Not too hot, not too cold.  A breeze muffs your hair ever so slightly as you walk towards your car.  Shorts are the norm, and the AC is on high.  It's the best time to pack up and go to the beach, sit on your deck or visit your local park.  So why oh why is the video store jam packed every night??  Seriously folks, nature needs to be enjoyed.  Now, I am a huge hypocrite, because those who know me certainly would never mistake me for the outdoor type.  I'd much rather sit at home with a good movie, than sit on the beach with a..whaddaya call those things...books?  Anyway, I guess my gripe isn't that people are renting movies at such a high rate.  My gripe is with the movies that they're renting.  Manufactured crap like Secret Window, Barbershop 2 or The League of Extraordinary Bad Actors in an interesting concept that was executed in the most horrendous way as humanly possible.  So I have a few suggestions for those of you who will venture to your local DVD outpost in search of a good movie.  Editor's Note: If you are fan of 2 Fast 2 Furious or Mr. Deeds, do not continue reading.  Instead, turn on your oven, stick your head in, and ask how inbreeding is allowed to occur in this country.  Anyway...  Here's a film you defenitely need to check out.

American Splendor

In this biopic, Paul Giamatti, known in many circles as Pig Vomit from Howard Stern's Private Parts, plays real life underground comic book legend Harvey Pekar.  Harvey is a misanthropic file clerk in Cleveland whose girlfriend has left him on the same day he returns from the doctor with a throat disease that has rendered him virtually speechless.  Even as he tries to persuade her to stay, he can't even get the words out, his raspy voice a tomb for his solidarity.  Harvey sludges through life in his disgusting apartment, one meaningless day after another until he meets artist Bob Crumb.  He then thinks if Crumb can be a cartoonist maybe he can have ambition too.  So he starts writing comics with him as the anti-hero, commenting on his appearance, dull vocational anecdotes, and standing behind Jewish women in the line at the grocery store. His comics, (illustrated by Crumb) are a mild success, but he still must maintain his job which he loathes.  He's a schmuck, but Giamatti gives him such warmth and humor that you wouldn't think he'd have.  It's one of the year's best performances.  What's more interesting is that the real life Harvey is a part of the movie as well, lacing his own commentary in between scenes of ""his life"".  Hope Davis plays hypochondriac wife Joyce and their courtship and resulting marraige is quite gleeful in its discomfort.  Funny, truthful and heartfelt, American Splendor is and American beauty."

I know I'm talking to myself and that no one is out there in crazy cyberspace, so just for my own records let me tell...me...that the laundry bit was written about a week ago, but I had no place to post it.  And now I do.  Thank you livejournal!!  This is not a journal however.  I will not write my innermost thoughts and feelings.  I will not kvell and drone on about my personal life.  I will not use this as an outlet for my anger or shortcomings.  This will be used as a forum for the quirks in life that pass me by.  Or a movie that I saw that needs to be reviewed.  Or as a guide to which others can enrich their lives.  And when I print it out, I can use it as toilet paper in case I run out.  If by some unreal chance you are a person reading this, please drop me a line, tell your friends, and come back tomorrow.  I'm sure that you'll be more entertained with each coming day.  Yeah!"

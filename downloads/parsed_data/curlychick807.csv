"event","Women are like apples on trees.
 The best ones are at the top of the tree.
 
 Most men don't want to reach for the good ones
 because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt.
 
 Instead, they just get the rotten apples from the
 ground that aren't as good, but easy.......
 
 So the apples at the top think something is wrong
 with them, when in reality, they're amazing.
 
 They just have to wait for the right man to come
 along, the one who's brave enough to climb all the
 way to the top of the tree."

i went to my cousins yesterday thinking that i'd be home around 7ish. then i was going to go spend the night at emmas but sweet how i didnt get home til 3 in the morning. yeah, that sucked. then i didn't get to go shopping with them for a homecomming dress which just proves that i shouldn't go anyway.

"event","so yesterday was possibly one of the scarriest days of my life. so after school i said that i would hang out with robby and cruise ""A"" with him so i did. then i had told emma that we would go and see her at runza. but on the way there, i asked if we could stop at my house to get me some money (cuz it was my turn to pay.lol.)and i wanted a jacket, so we turned right on to 33rd street and this guy ran a red light and ran into the back of robbys car. im not even joking you. so i didn't get to see my emzy, and i got some major bruises on my ribs. and my neck kinda hurt a lil too. but the scarry thing about the whole thing is that robby didn't really feel like driving that night, so he asked if i wanted too, and i almost said yes, but i decided against it....so that could have easily been me and i would have been in soo much trouble. im just glad im alive. yes, it was that bad. i think it was a God thing, but u never know. 
so today i went shopping with all my relatives and it was fun... i guess. and i got a new purse!! yay!! its pink with pineapples, and jewels and stuff on it. its the cutest purse i own...almost as cute as my black one with the words. but yeah. so emma just called and wanted me to go to a movie with her but my parents are super gay and wont let me go to a 9:30 showing...how stupid is that? but i might just spend the night at her house tomorrow.. we'll see. so that was my day. i hope urs was good. i get to go hold my new baby cousin vanessa now..yay!!!

where everything about her
is so gorgeous
and where her thoughts inside her
are ones she could share
i have been lost long ago
and things just seem dark
i don't understand what to do with myself
im torn between past, future, and reality
where to go and what to know
how to see what you all do
i have to keep going
im sorry for this
i really can't stop fo all of you

how far are my limits?
and what do i need.

<lj-cut>MY FAVORITE MISTAKE

I woke up and called this morning
The tone of your voice was a warning
That you don't care for me anymore

I made up the bed we sleep in
I looked at the clock when you creep in
It's 6 a.m. and I'm alone

Did you know when you go
It's the perfect ending
To the bad day I was just beginning
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake

Well, your friends are sorry for me
They watch you pretend to adore me
But I'm no fool to this game

Now here comes your secret lover
She'd be unlike any other
Until your guilt goes up in flames

Did you know when you go
It's the perfect ending
To the bad day I've gotten used to spending
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake

Well maybe nothin' lasts forever
Even when you stay together
I don't need forever after
It's your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way

Did you know, could you tell
You were the only one 
That I ever loved
Now everything's so wrong

Did you see me walking by?
Did it ever make you cry?

You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake </lj-cut>"

On top of that some people were going to amandas house to watch the game and of course i couldn't go b/c my parents were being stupid and decided that we were gonna go see my new cousin instead. which is cool i guess... if they would have let me know before hand so i wouldn't get my hopes up with hanging out with some friends this weekend. yeah..that was my day. pretty shitty huh. 
so this whole nikki thing has gotten me in a pretty bad mood. maybe im just overreacting but seriously, if your gonna say that your gonna hang out with somebody, HANG OUT WITH THEM! dont flake and then decide not to call. yeah that was really cool of her. let me just say that it really made my day."

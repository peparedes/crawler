"event","Hello to all my American friendlies across the sea!!!!

You have no idea how much I miss you guys. It's insane. And how much I miss Nacogdoches... I don't know if that's really sad, but I love that place! Estonia is such an amazing opportunity, but I'm finding it hard to live in the present right now. I keep pining for what's to come and what I will do when I finally go home. I don't want to wish time away, but it's hard not to when I'm not truly happy. 

Question:
Why do any of you guys want to be actors? 

This query has been racing through my mind ever since I got here and I'm trying to find answers. 

Well, I miss you all so very much and I hope the shows and your lives are going well. Drop me a line and let me know what you're up to!

"event","Doubt anyone reads this anymore, but just thought I'd state how amazing Estonia is.

It's amazing!

The town has a medieval look to it and there are really great places to it. There's one cafe in particular that is our own little ""Central Perk"", except the mood is more chill and Jennifer Aniston isn't serving us...

Anywho, the school is pretty awesome. It's not very big, but the facilities are new and the whole building is exclusively for the theatre programme; all 33 students of theirs. Right now no one is in the school except for the 16 Rose Bruford kids being loud and running wild.

We had speech technique and acting today, then tomorrow we have acrobatics, acting, and estonian theatre history! Also, this week we will also have dance (ballet) and singing classes! 

I guess the only downside here would be the dorms, but I guess they're comparable to Kerr or Griffith, just a little smaller and the stench coming from the toilets makes me gag every time I accidentally get a whiff of it. There are also lots of Japanese kids who live here (authentic ones) who seem to burn every meal that they make, so there's also a smell of burnt noodles. The rooming situation is like a sleep over though because I'm rooming with four of my friends, but none of us have been able to sleep. That's definitely no bueno. 

Well, going to hopefully get some sleep now. Hope all is well in the land of Nacogdoches and else where!

"event","Well, it's been quite a while, so I thought I'd update you's peoples a little bit. 

England has turned out to be pretty freakin' amazing. The classes are brilliant! We're learning from a teacher who's third generation Meyerhold and second generation Chekov. He basically kicks ass! Also learning about Spanish theatre and Greek, which are both really interesting. I'm very glad I took this opportunity to come to Rose Bruford. I would highly advise anyone who is interested to go here to come for a life changing experience.

As far as everything else, the weather is getting colder and it's been shitty and rainy all weekend, but what do you expect? I do really, really miss Texas and surprisingly enough SFA, so much! You really don't realize all the things you miss until you don't have them anymore. Such as:
1. your good friends
2. warm weather
3. being surrounded by Texans
4. US efficiency
5. Fast food
6. late consumer hours
7. American food and flavors
8. Taco Bell!
9. Ranch Dressing
10. Thanksgiving and other holiday celebrations!
11. Really good house parties
12. The value of the US Dollar : /
13. Texas sunsets
14. American accents
15. Mexican food!
16. And of course, my family who loves me unconditionally

I'm sure there are many other things, I just can't think of them right now. On the plus side, I am enjoying the sights and the theatre. I've seen more theatre here than I've ever seen in my life, just because it's all at your feet and cheap too! You can see quality theatre at the National Theatre for only 10 pounds. That's $20. I think when I return I'll also be more appreciative of the theatre available to us. We have it pretty darn good at SFA.

I'm also discovering how great it is to meet new people and to get to know and experience their culture. The nationalities here are so diverse and it's not unusual to hear a million different accents everywhere you go. Everyone at Rose Bruford has been really nice and very welcoming to us loud Americans. This week Thomas got an American Football sent over and we've been playing on campus with the Brits who are eager to learn the game.

You do discover when you're here why Brits drink so much. It's literally the only thing to do at night. Seriously. Besides the downside of losing brain cells, by the time I get back I'll have acquired the skill of drinking most of you guys under the table.&nbsp; Do you think I can put that on my resume? 

Anywho, I hope all is well at home and please keep me posted on everything. I love and miss all of you very much and don't forget that I'll be back!

Love,
Brittany,
The actress formally known as The Asian"

"event","So, London is pretty much amazing. We are staying outside of Twickenham in Strawberry Hill , a small suburb that's absolutely beautiful! The weather is a bit chilly for a Texas native, but layers certainly help. It does take some adjusting to get used to the sun setting at 10:00 pm and rising at 4:30 am, but I've managed to sleep through it. The weather is just as indecisive as I am, so it never gets boring! Definitely carry an umbrella with you at all times. We went to the Tower of London today and saw some cool stuff and then took a boat ride on the Thames River. It feels like I'm somewhere familiar, which is strange to me because I'm usually very disoriented when I travel somewhere new. We get to see Wicked tomorrow, which I'm so ready for and hopefully we will be meeting up with Chad, Nat and Sionelle at some point. I love you all and I hope y'alls summer is going well! I will keep everyone posted (or at least those who are interested).

Although you may be distracted by Matthew McConaughey's unfortunate ""accent""(which I would attempt to decipher, but I don't know what the hell he was going for) it's worth watching. 

There's an amazing part of the movie where Cinque (the African slave) is saying he will call upon his ancestors for help because their reason for existense was for him to be where he is. That really made me think how true that is. If your ancestors had not done what they did, would you even be here today or be the same person? 

That really makes me want to delve into my family history and find out who was who and where they were from. I think that it's very important to have knowledge and pride in your family's origins because that's one of the things that makes us unique. Everyone has a different journey of how they came to be and I'd like to know mine.

Anywho, Nick has inspired me to look into doing things I've always wanted to do, but have never really tried to pursue doing them. That's one of the things I love most about him is that when he wants to do something he just does it. No questions or   hesitations. He is amazing.

I'm thinking I want to learn how to play drums and I want to find out what my grandmother used to play in the indonesian orchestra. Also, maybe belly dancing? Oh, the endless possibilities.

"event","I spent almost 2 hrs. harassing Gretchen Cryer with questions last night at the party. She is such a sweet and wonderful woman, but she must have thought I was a complete bimbo. I'm so completely and utterly embarassed! Not that I spent the whole time asking her about ""Johnny"" (what she called him... sigh), but when she mentioned that she would tell him that he has a fan and that she would see if he could send me an autographed picture I literally turned into a giddy blonde who is incapable of social interaction (no offense). I seriously just nervously giggled and smiled and couldn't say anything but ""wow"". GOD, I'M AN IDIOT!!! 

And then I attempted to gain ground by asking her about her life and the things she's done, which she seemed happy to answer. She is a very interesting and honest lady and I appreciate her putting up with me all night. She gave a lot of great advice about living in New York and where to go and what to do from here. She also mentioned her son again and how the show is going for him. I totally contradicted myself by saying, ""Do you find it weird how the media and people make movie stars into idols, when they're just regular people?"". I didn't realize how stupid i was until after I left the party. I think I'll write her a letter of apology. Maybe I'm just beating myself up over this, but I really do feel like a retard for my responses to her speaking of my beloved ""Johnny"". Poor Nicholas was standing their the whole time watching me make a fool of myself, God bless him. A cool thing though was that Gretchen said Nick actually kind of looked like him. That's awesome. I love you Nick, and I would never leave you... even for Mr. Cryer himself. That was little hard to admit. J/k. 

So that was my failed brush with fame. Do you think it was a little much that I told her I have a Pretty In Pink poster above my bed?... on second thought, don't answer that."

"event","So spring break is nearly over and we've had ONE day of sun. Needless to say, I didn't get the tan I was hoping for... Clark FINALLY left today. Not that I wanted him to go back at all, but he's been trying to get back to Nac since Wednesday and the poor kid has the worst luck. First, Nick's car broke down as we were trying to leave Houston, then we can't take him back Thursday, then Friday doesn't happen, then he gets a gigantic spider bite on his arm, so I'm hoping he actually makes it back ok. In other news, we had a great week with lots of fun and unproductiveness, like a spring break should be. Went to see Journey's End at the Alley and it was pretty good. Nick and I went to a Scottish festival last night the it was pretty awesome. Nick was practically orgasming over the bagpipes the whole time. Ok, so I did get a little jealous ;D. We also did a lot of hanging out and such, so it's been good! I'm glad to be going back though, but not so excited about the work that's coming my way. Oh well... I'll have my friends and my duckie. Can't wait to see you all and be safe coming back! I love you guys!!!!!

So, Nicholas and I finally watched the Notebook last night for the first time. Let me just say that the events in that movie eerily parallels what has already happened in our lives, with the exception of the whole being old, having Alzheimers and dying together... Ok, and the exception that I wasn't engaged to anyone else, and my parents aren't rich, and nick didn't go to war,and his best friend didn't die, and he didn't build a gigantic beautiful house... You might be thinking ""Then how the hell does that movie really parallel your life?"". The answer is... it just does. Anypoop, it was a really beautiful movie and we cried... The End."

"event","Deeply passionate conversations are what I love most with my man. I'm very excited about what the future holds. Still a little unsure of all the details, but I know in my heart that everything will work according to His plan. I can't wait to ring in a happier new year surrounded by the people I love, which is each and everyone of you! I do truly love and appreciate all of you b/c your kind words and support is what keeps me living day to day. I hope I do the same for each of you. Have a loverly cold week and if you need to keep warm, come find me ;D

"event","When my mom goes to work, I am all alone in the apartment.  I really like the new rug she bought.  It's mine now.  I like to lay on it and when people come in the door it scares me because they try to knock me off my rug, my luxurious, glorious rug.

Last night I started to pee on the carpet and mom got mad.  She smacked me and chased me with a water bottle.  I ran away.  She didn't catch me.  Ha ha ha.  After she cleaned and tried to descent the area so I wouldn't think to go there again, she fell asleep on the couch and I pooped in the same spot.  I'm so sneaky!  Sly like a fox!

I wish that I could just use the litter box and be satisfied with that.  Then maybe my mom wouldn't forget to feed me all the time.  Well, she doesn't forget, but sometimes I want more food than she feeds me, and not to mention she put me on DIET food.  What the heck?  Just because I'm getting fatty doesn't mean I need diet food.  Sheesh.

I'll just poop on the carpet again.  I'll show her."

"event","I like to smell the garbage.  My mom ate some Thai food tonight and it smells good.  Too bad it was only spinach that was left of it.  I don't like spinach.
I do like to eat dairy, though.  
I pooped on the floor the other day for the first time in over four months.  Boy, was my mom mad.
She put my nose in it.  I HATE it when she does that.  Then she spanked me soundly.
Ha, I showed her.
She still petted me and cuddled with me tonight when she got home.  Moms forget everything.
I hear talk of her going away for awhile and leaving me with Nena.  
I hope Nena doesn't forget to feed me.
If she does I'll bite her.
There were alot of people here this weekend.
Strangers always want to pet my head and sometimes it makes me just want to bite them so I can show them I'm not just a cute kitty.
They shall know by my bite that I'm not playing games here.

My friend <lj user=tenaciousg> was supposed to visit me, but he hasn't.  I think he was going to bring me some beer from <lj user=pepper_boxer>. 

Man, I'd love a beer.
Or some catnip.
Or some chicken.

Yeah.. chicken."

"event","So, today has been weird.  My mom left and now there are people here that I don't know.  Not to mention.. something has drastically changed in the room where my toys are, you know, the room next to where my food is. 
What used to be very interesting moving balls of fluff are now gone.  I checked on them yesterday and they were asleep.  I think that they were very tired from running in their wheel because they slept almost all day.  
I'm glad my mom feeds me and pets me.
That's it for now.  I think I am going to chase a bug and then poop in my litter box."

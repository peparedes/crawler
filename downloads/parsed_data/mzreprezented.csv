"event","i was late to work, in fact, i've been late to work this past week. anyways, my co-workers are late too. anyways, it's that time of the month and i was so tired at work. i wanted to sleep because it was nice and cool in the office not like at home where it's hot as fukk. anyways, i was supposed to go deposit my check, instead i went to safeway and bought me pads. then i got in a traffic jam, and went to the restroom at macy's where i had to walk hella far with my 4 incch heels. it was torture! anyways, i went to the bank and deposit jase check and the lady told me that they usually endorse insurance checks and if they get it returned we're getting charged for it. wtf? he's deployed and can't endorse it. well i decided to go to MCD for lunch. by the time i got back to work, i didn't have time for lunch. so i ate 1 cheeseburger and fries and drank 1/4 of my soda. i couldn't eat. i was bloated, tired and in pain. thank god i made it through the day. then i had to drive all the way to my other job (the one that i quit on sunday) to return the skirt and pick up my check. i came home and relaxed. well my mom is helping me out with my avon business. she's my network! well anyways, i slept for 1/2 hour and got ready to go to the movies. i went to my cousins house and they were not there, i called her and they were eating dinner. so i met with them at the theaters and we watched Raise Your Voice starring Hilary Duff. the movie was not bad. i wish they had more singing involved. i spent $18.00 10.00 for food and the rest for my ticket. damn, i really need to stop spending so much money. i need to save up for xmas, plus all these things i want to buy are so expensive. I want a PDA, Multifunction printer, Graphic Pen and IPOD, plus other things like clothes, shoes and accessories. well i'll cut back the spending starting November. next week will be the last week to spend because my friends from high school and i are having like a reunion next friday if all works out their schedule. well that's all, i'm hella tired, i'm fricken blind and i'm going to sleep."

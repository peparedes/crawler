<lj-cut text=""LiveJournal Analysis"">

<h1>Your Livejournal Analasys</h1><p>
<h3>Your Livejournal's Age</h3><p>
According to the information you provided, your Livejournal was created on 2002-12-28, meaning that your journal has been around for 14 days.  What does this mean?<p>
Well, for starters, your journal is less than a month old!  Being brand new to the LJ scene, chances are that you haven't really had a chance to form your posting habits.  A lot of brand-new LJ users tend to post a lot more from the start than they end up doing, so your average number of posts might be a little high.  Chances are you are still learning the basic functions that LJ has to offer, and every day you might learn something new!<p>
<h3>Your Livejournal Friends</h3><p>
Now let's talk about your friends list.  You indicated that you have 529 LJ friends.
 You are going a little overboard, don't you think?  This puts you in a friend-a-day category, or worse.  Your propensity for adding people so quickly probably irritates others, and they wonder if you don't just add every single journal you ever see.  Do you?  But let's not be harsh - maybe you just really like to read.<p>
You also have been listed as a friend by 47 users.
 That's a decent amount of people paying attention to your journal.  Given the fact that your journal is still young, you've done a fairly good job of advertising yourself.  Probably got all your friends to add you, maybe joined a few LJ communities to meet some new folks.  All in all, a large list for the time you've been around.  
<p>
Finally in this category, you have a friends to friends-of ratio of 11.255319148936.  
 This is an extremely high ratio, meaning you add a lot more people than have added you to their journals.  Although this usually indicates someone who is something of a lonely person looking for friends, it might simply mean that you are inclined to add every single journal you come across, no matter how much of a friend the person actually is.<p>
<h3>Your Posting Habits</h3><p>
You have indicated that to date, you have made 7 entries into your Livejournal.  This gives us an average post rate of 0.5 posts per day.
 With this kind of post rate, you are updating at least once every other day, sometimes once a day.  This seems to indicate that you like to keep your friends (or simply your journal) updated on the day to day progress of your life, no matter how boring or exciting.  There are days when you simply have nothing to say, and on those days you simply say nothing, although you make a good effort to update when you can.<p>
<h3>Your Commenting Habits</h3><p>
According to your information, you have posted 33 comments and have recieved 30 of them over the lifetime of your journal.  Let's see what this information can mean.<p>
First of all, this indicates that you have been getting an average of 4.2857142857143 comments for every Livejournal entry that you make.
 With an average of at least 2 comments per post or greater, you enjoy a healthy dialogue with your friends and get a lot of response to what you have to say.  You might also be posting those silly web quizzes, or making entries that are so interesting or so unusual that people can't help but to comment.  Either that, or you just have a buttload of friends.<p>
A more fair measure of how many comments you get might be your average number of comments per post per friend, which is 0.0081015392924656.  This may seem low to you, especially if you have lots of friends.
<p>
The final statistic is the ratio of your comments to comments you get.  Your ratio is 1.1.  The higher the ratio, the more talkative you are compared to your friends, comment-wise.
<p>
That's it for now!  Perhaps there was something insightful in this analasys, and perhaps you learned absolutely nothing.  Feel free to post your results on your own Livejournal, and invite your friends to take the <a href=""http://arkyandragon.port5.com/lj_ana.htm"">Livejournal Analasys</a> today!"

I feel pretty bummed when a favorite band of mine breaks up. If I have never seen them perform live it only adds to how worse I feel. I usually scramble around to buy/download all of their old music and start watching all of their old live performances. I do this for a couple of days and eventually let it go. They've already made their legacy with the music they have left behind."

The most disturbing cartoon character is that creepy kid that was always breathing really hard behind Helga on Hey Arnold. Even when I was a little kid he would terrify me. lol"

So, I went to the Asian festival for the first time today. It was pretty fun. It was the first time in months that I've been able to spend quality time with my closest of friends. It was awesome.

I got a crappy henna tattoo done. It was only three dollars, but it was worth it. It's pretty enough and it isn't permanent. :)

Hopefully, I'll do this again next year."

It bothers at how limp and unmoving that lady's arm was in the beginning of the video...


Today started out kind of rough. I was so incredibly stressed for most of my day. I didn't begin to feel any better until I walked Nana home. What good long walk. :)

I caught Dionte on his way home and we talk for a while, maybe an hour.

I'm just glad this day didn't turn to be as horrid as I thought it would be :D"

Lion King is one of the best kid movies ever! This movie used to make me so sad at certain parts. 

I'm watching it right now...Simba's dad just died *tear*

It's sad to think that a movie like Lion king would be not successful if it was released now-a-days. Everything is so watered down and boring. The characters in the Lion King are some of my favorite cartoon characters of all time.

Ah, nostalgia...:)"

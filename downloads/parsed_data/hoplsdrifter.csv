<h2>Your Secret Fetish Is <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/piercings.html"">Piercings</a>!</h2>
<br>
Not only is the pain a big rush, as you know, piercings are a great sexual enhancer. 
<br>
Sure, you may not be able to get a job with your punctured face, 
<br>
but you will have incredible sex! 
<br>
Kiss and suck away, but don't get your piercings locked with your lover's.

<h2>You are Marijuana!</h2>
Laid back, dreamy, and maybe a little stinky from skipping a shower.<br>
You rather hang out on the couch watching That 70s Show than go clubbing.<br>
All you need is a big joint, TV, and some Twinkies covered in chocolate syrup!

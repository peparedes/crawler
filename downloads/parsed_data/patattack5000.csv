"event","Growing up in Seattle, I remember watching old episodes of Bill Nye the Science Guy on PBS. In fact, I still remember the AC/DC Charge parody of ""Achey Breakey Heart"" they did on one episode. So to call it a pleasant surprise when the man himself WALKED INTO MY WORK today would be a bit of an understatement. 'Nearly losing my shit' would be a more appropriate way to gauge my reaction. Not that he's the most famous guy in the world, I don't know if his show is still on, but it's a really cool feeling to be standing a few feet away and interacting with someone who's work influenced my childhood, and perhaps the person I am today. It's little moments like this that begin to make this drastic change in my life worth it."

So here goes:

Preface to the rant:

It rained today. Not too hard, certainly not by Seattle standards, but all the Los Angelinos at my work were commenting on it.

Rant Proper:

1) This city is not build to withstand rain. In Seattle, there are gutters that collect the rain water and the streets are sloped so water runs off. Not so much here. Instead, the water just collects on the road and creates lots of puddles. Good for a Gene Kelly song, but not for the evening commute.

2) It took me 30 minutes longer to get home tonight. Perhaps the wet roads made people drive slower, but it didn't feel like it. My theory is that rain is such an anomaly here that MORE people drive in it just to see what it's like.

Rant over.

As for the job, everything's going fine. Basically what I do is data entry. Someone brings in a video on some kind of format (DVD, VHS, etc) and we turn it in to something else, or duplicate it many times. I don't do the actually duplications yet, I just fill out the forms for the people that do. I'll probably do duplications in the future, but I think this is a crawling before walking scenario. Everyone I work with is really cool, they're for the most part film geeks, so I feel right at home."

I haven't started yet, my first day is Monday, but it's great to have this HUGE load off for the time being. 

Also, you may have noticed two of my posts are gone. That's because apparently I said things in them about people I wasn't supposed to, and I got an irritated email from the concerned party asking me to take stuff off. They somehow found my Journal online. So, consider my face red when I read that email. Oops."

"event","Well, the day has finally come. My cousin and I have moved into LA. Koreatown, to be more specific. So, I guess, that makes me offically an angel. Or of not, at least I live in close proximity to some. Let me know if you need a heavenly favor, I'll put a note in their suggestion box. We've been here since Saturday, but we just got internet today. Basically I've been a hermit, only drifting a few blocks here and there in our neighborhood. We live a few blocks south of Wilshire, the famous street that has the La Brea tar pits, art museum, and the Miracle mile. It's also where Notorious BIG was killed, so it's got that going for it too (Thanks Caddyshack). My first 'welcome to LA' moment was when I went to the local gas station to buy a copy of the Sunday LA times to get ads for cell phones (yeah, I know) and guess what? NONE OF THEM WERE IN ENGLISH. Seven papers, all in either Korean or Spanish. To quote John Rocker: ""How the hell did they get into this country?"" Just kidding. So now the real job hunt begins, hopefully I can find something soon. I'll keep posting on here if anything new happens, or if I see anyone famous. Until next time..."

"event","Ok, so here's the tale of how I got beat up. This all happened about a month ago (cue flashback t.v. effects). So it's friday night and my cousin and I are sitting around watching television when a friend of his from Berkley calls saying he wants to come down and get drunk. His friend, let's call him Bob, is a Marine and lives at Camp Pendleton which is about 40 miles north of San Diego. So he comes down and we get drunk, playing the Roxanne game and watching Bloodsport 3 on cable tv. They decide we should go to a bar and get some Taco Fiesta, which is a take-out Mexican place near the house. We go to the bar, I got REALLY drunk, we played pool and did the whole 'bar thing' and then proceeded to the next destination: the food. Flash forward a few minutes and we were standing in line at Taco Fiesta waiting to get our stuff while talking to these other guys who were also waiting. Apparently, Bob said something like ,""nice boxers"" to one of them because he was wearing jeans with a wife-beater and his boxers were showing. So the guy gets really pissed and tries to fight right there, but his friends hold him back. They leave and we figure it's the end of it. We get our food and leave. On the walk back, about a block from the restaurant, a car screeches up in front of us and 6 guys get out, including the offended party, and begin to jump us. My memories are a little blurry but I remember getting hit in the mouth and the back of the head and laying on the cement. Shortly thereafter the assailants left and we walked home. So that's how I got beat up."

"event","So it's been about a month and I realized I've been much lazier than I expected in filling this stuff out. Well, here's what happened in the last month. I finished the script for a pilot (that's the first episode of a t.v. show that's supposed to entice the network into making more, for those of you that haven't seen Pulp Fiction). I typed out, or more like copied and pasted, 67 query letters to send to agents. Query letters are basically these letters that say, ""Hey I wrote this script that you could sell. Sign me!"" I expect the rejections to start pouring in any day now, since I sent them out last week. Not that I'm being a pessemist, but I think getting used to the word 'no' is a very valuable character trait in the entertainment business. So that script is done, I've started the rough sketches for a new one, which I hope to have the first draft finished for by Christmas time. I've been applying to jobs left and right, so far no one is really interested, but that is to be expected considering I live 150 miles away. Right now my cousin and I are apartment hunting in LA. We've decided to get a single bedroom because we can get in a better neighborhood that way. A 1 bedroom for 1200 is much better than a 2 bedroom for 1200. I just don't want to get robbed. I've already gotten beaten up once since I've been here, I'd like to keep those occurances rare. Basically, I've been working on job and script stuff during the week and binging on movies over the weekend. Thanksgiving was fine, I spent it with my Dad's parents. We went out to eat and I had shrimp because turkey is gross. So that's that, if anything interesting happens I'll put it on here. I'm sorry this message was boring and if you're still reading by this point you can hit me when I get back to Seattle for stealing your valuable time. Oh yeah, I'll be back from December 24th through January 3rd. I look forward to seeing everyone again. Ta ta!"

"event","It's been a while since the last update so I thought I'd buckle down and give ya'll a heads up on the goings on down here in the durrrty south.....west. I interviewed to be a tutor with this guy who had way too nice of a house for an educator. You could see the beach from it, which automatically makes it around a million. Real Estate is ridiculous down here, must be something about the sun and authentic Mexican cuisine. The guy was supposedly going to call me and give me some kids to mold, but he hasn't and I'm kinda wondering if he blew me off. By the way, I hate the whole 'I'll call you' line from employers. In my experience, only about half of the people that say that actually mean it. The other half just wants to dangle it out there to see how long you can go not hearing from them, so you break down and call them. Why can't people just say what the mean all the time? So a few feelings would be hurt, but the world would be more efficient. I also had an interview with some company in LA that makes car videos. I would be the guy that labels all the tapes and puts them on a big tape rack, basically the same thing I was doing at the library, except tapes instead of books. According to my extensive research, and by that I mean typing in 'getting a job in Hollywood' on Google, this job is the best way to eventually become an editor, which is what I'd like to do. The only problem is it only pays $12 an hour, which amounts to about 25000 a year. That's not enough to live on, especially in LA. But I'm ok, because the guy said 'he'd call me.' I should mention that it takes 2 hours to get from San Diego to LA, and when you drive up there leaving at 9 am (early for me) and the guy talks to you for 5 minutes, and actually answers his phone during the interview and proceeds to have a conversation that is longer than the interview itself, you might be a little upset. The guy was also kind of a jerk. From the moment he saw me and shook my hand, he had that look in his eyes that he didn't like me. It could be because he was having a bad day, the fact that I was wearing a dress shirt and tie while he was adorned in jeans and an ESPN t-shirt, or it was my first introduction to the world of Los Angeles egos. Needless to say, I don't think this job is for me, even though it's the only interview I've had so far. I really want to move into the city now, rather than in January, mainly because it's 260 miles to LA and back and if I have 3 more interviews that's a grand I've put on the odometer. (I'm almost at 100,000 yay! giggle giggle). I also am supposed to edit a version of ""The Tell Tale Heart"" for this guy, but he also hasn't called for a while when he said he would. I'm beginning to think I must sound disagreeable, either that or the rules of etiquette have changed without my knowing. Did you guys get a memo? As for my free time, I've been watching entirely too much television, but after writing all day it's nice to have my brain melt for a little while. Harvey, you'd be happy to know that I started watching Lost. Hanso Corporation! And Boston Legal. Spaaaaderrrr! That's pretty much it. Spider Solitaire is too addicting."

i'm a horrible critic of my own writing. everything i put down feels alright to me, i think all those years of winging it on essays and turning in first drafts made me a horrible revisionist. i was also looking at this book on how to sell a screenplay and it said no one sells their first screenplay. it reminded me of this old calvin and hobbes cartoon where calvin builds a time machine so he can go into the future when his math homework is already done and bring it back to the past.

"event","Ok, so this just seemed easier than sending emails, especially since now you can look at this at your leasure rather than have me inundate with messages and flood your inboxes. So I'll start at the beginning, my dad's sperm and my mom's egg, oh, sorry. I left my house in fairwood at about 430 in the afternoon on saturday the 10th and hit the road. I actually looked up the MapQuest from my parents house to my aunt's house in San Diego, just to see the mileage. I was to be on I-5 for about 1200 miles. The drive was pretty uneventful, I made it to Sacremento before I got tired and went to sleep, but only for 30 minutes. The most expensive gas I had to buy was in this town called Yreka, CA, where a gallon of unleaded goes for 3.29. So, around 1215 in the afternoon on Sunday I arrived at my aunt's house, only to find that no one was home, or so I thought. To kill some time I did some 'splorin' around the neighborhood to see where all the important buildings were, ie bank, grocery store, etc. When I returned to my aunts still no one was home so I sat on her front porch for a while. Eventually she returned and let me in, and to my surprise my cousin had been home the whole time he just didn't here me knocking. My aunt's house is a one story 2 bedroom affair that has a very spacious look because there are almost no dividing walls between rooms. Besides the bedrooms and bathroom, everything is pretty much free flowing, which must make dinner parties an absolute breeze! Also, there's a pool and jacuzzi in the back, which overlooks the freeway. It's actually as pretty great view. The rest of Sunday I got settled in and went to bed early. The next day I set about getting a library card and buying groceries, instead of Safeway here they have Vons, but I didn't need to get a new value club card so all was well. That night I began reading Story by Robert Mckee, the guy who teaches the story seminar in Adaptation. I spent pretty much all Tuesday finishing the book, I wanted to get it done by the time we went to the lake Wednesday night. His book is about how I expected, he takes the story format and compartmentalizes it so a writer can attack storytelling one area at a time. All in all a decent read, not completely eye-opening but maybe more of a slight realignment. So that was Tuesday, Wednesday we set off (my cousin Mike and I, who I'm living with) for Moreno Valley, where my uncle lives. We stayed there Wednesday night and set off bright and early for the lake on Thursday morning. Lake Havesu is in Arizona so the drive was a couple of hours, just what I felt like doing after coming down here. Also, my cousin can't drive stick. We got to the lake and began unpacking and basically spent the rest of the day sitting around the camp site relaxing, reading, playing card games and Boggle, which I discovered I'm pretty lousy at. Friday was more of the same, except this day I went on the WaveRunner which was good fun. I had this whole moral dilemma of whether or not I should aim for the ducks while out on the water. I chose the less-murderous route, in case Buddism is the real faith and I don't want to go to Meifumado. Friday night my younger cousin (Greg, some of you have met him) and uncle Steve left the lake to return to Moreno Valley and left Mike and I there, we stayed because we were going to Vegas on Saturday and Havasu is closer to it that Moreno Valley. Saturday morning we awoke and hit the road again, taking the highway that goes over the hoover dam, which was a pretty incredible site. We arrived at vegas and got into our room (at the Luxor), where I met a bunch of Mike's college friends. One guy, Steve, reminded me a lot of Greg's friend Keith. Anyway, we killed some time during the day, hung out by the pool, got something to eat, then came back to the room and prefunked as the kids are calling it these days. Many drinks later we set out for the club, which was supposed to be PURE at MGM. Only Pure isn't at MGM, it's at Caesars. We caught a cab down to Caesers only to discover the line was insane, and that some of us, myself included, were not wearing dress-code appropriate shoes. So we left and went to the Voodoo Lounge at the Rio, which was actually a really cool club. It's basically on the roof of the Rio and overlooks the whole strip. A few hours later we left and headed back, then went to sleep. My cousin stayed and apparently walked back (we took a cab), then got in bed later. A little while later I woke up randomly, and a few seconds later Mike almost puked on me, but had the presence of mind to lean over the bed. The next day we got up and went to Bally's for the buffet, where I ate an obscene amount of French toast. Then we hit the road home, and it was here that I stopped for gas and had the aformentioned trucker incident. We went back to Moreno Valley, stayed the night, and the next afternoon came back here. That was monday, and here I am now Tuesday morning, writing at a time I thought I would never see again. So far, everything's been great, everyone has been very nice. I've got some ideas I need to turn into stories, which hopefully someone will bite on. Other than that, I'm looking for a crappy job for the next few months to save some money for the move to LA in January. Thank you all who came to the party last week, and thank you all for the wonderfull gifts. I'll be back around Christmas with relative certainty so everyone do a bunch of interesting things so I can hear about them. I'll try and do the same, but it's a little difficult when you know 2 people in a whole city. Alright, that's all for now, I'll update this whenever something interesting happens, until then just assume that I'm spending my days writing, looking for work, and standing in awe of my all powerful fantasy football team. Toodle-oo, everyone!"

"event","It just seems like everythiing is going to crap with me. I am desperately looking for a job and have been for months and still noone has called. I found out that the G.E.D costs $150.00, and the test is like 4 1/2 hours long for two days. Its gunna suck but I need to get my ass rollin. This is my life, this is when everything I do effects my future, carreer, friends,and myself. I can't be alittle kid no more. It's pretty damn hard to do all this stuff and still go through other problems that I have in life, but noone said that it was goin to be easy. Every little thing you do everyday has an effect on you either then or later on in life. Its kinda crazy when you think about it, it all effects your future and what the outcome will be. 
 You really start to depend on money more and more you grow up. You need money for everything these days. Having a car is also exspensive, that is like a privledge, but alot of people forget about it and ruin it for themselves and others, and also by put other peoples lives in danger. This world is so dangerous and we dont even know how dangerous it really is. That blows my mind out of the water when I think of how dangerous our homes really are. I mean when your home you feel safe, but look at all the things around you that can harm you and just outside the door something really bad is happening to someone right that second. Well thats all I have to say. I think people should realize how dangerous it really is, but do you think that if everyone in the world realized how dangerous it really is that they would be scared or would try to change it?? That all depends on us and us only. I dont think they would know how to change it and try to make it better."

"event","Well where do I begin??? Me and Michael broke up. It really hurts, but then again it dont. But when it does hurt it hurts so bad to whyere I just want to be left into a dark cave and just cry, because I cant find a job I'm getting no where!! Now I feel like that I have someone to talk to and that understands how Im feeling. Its gunna be really weird. We both agreed on it, I was just getting sick of doing this over and over and Michael said that he dont want the telling his bf wheres hes going and stuff like that. I dont know if It hurts him as bad but if so he is a real damn good actor!!! It just felt like he was the only one that understood how I was feeling and why. It made it kinda easier to talk to him, all my other friends dont do it all that much. My emotions are going nuts!! I wanna talk to someone but I dont know who to call or who to talk to. I just dont know whats gunna happen to us now. Its sad to think about it, but I guess it was ment to be. Now I guess we can only rely on is fate.... I guess."

"event","Water. Whatever you do, where or when, you do it with all of your heart. You listen to your heart and all of your emotions are true non-acting. Friends are very importent to you and you will do anything for them. You're the most dreamy of all 4 elements. 

 
D:
You take the Path of Least Resistance. Why make things hard for yourself? You are a go-with-flow sort of person and little gets to you. Why? Because it's all good, right? They say the path of least resistance is a straight line and that's where you go, ever forward and never looking back. It's good to keep the past behind you, a quality far too little people have these days. You know the past is the past, but don't let yourself forget it. You can't learn from your mistakes if you don't remember them. You're probably loved for your laid-back frame of mind and easy-going qualities , but you tend take the easy way out in life and verge on lazy. Great character is found through great challenges. You most likely have the abilities in you to succeed and over-come what life throws at you. You just got get up and face that challenge. You tend to lose your head in bad situations because you aren't used to them. And by the time you've found the easiest way to master a problem, you could've already taken care of it. Bad things happen, difficult situations come up, that's life. What matters is that you rise to face those challenges and you can do it. Never lose your laid-back qualities as they will help you greatly. Just step onto that hard road every once in awhile and you'll discover that with each stretch it becomes easier and easier to over-come life's hurdles."

"event","<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Well last night I hung out with Michael, because he wanted to talk. So I went over there and went to the ""store"" and then we were goin to go to the movies but then we decided to go to Crystal's house but it turns out that she wasnt home. Well what Michael had to tell me was that he thinks that he might move if he takes a student loan out for school, because if he goes in depth then he wants to go in depth in a school he likes. But he's not sure, because he dont want to ruin our almost 1 1/2 month relationship, Crystal will have her baby, Noah growing up. There would be so much that he would be missing out and thats what hes not sure about. When I heard that I just wanted to go home and cry. It was so hard not to cry in the car goin and coming from Crystal's house, but I just wanted to hang out with him.....I miss it alot!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Then we started to talk about ""us"", I said if he goes, that we both would wonder what could've happened. He he turns to me and says you dont think that we would get back together? Well...... I have no clue, people change and when people stay away from eachother they just learn to live without them and like different things. I dont think anyone could answer that. I mean who knows how long he would be gone 1yr., 2yrs. 4YRS.! You just never know I cant even give him the slightest clue about what I think. I mean I would love to get back together with him but who knows when that day would be. Then the fact that hes been with other guys and stuff like that and what has he done for the past whatever time that hes been gone. I think I would feel like I dont know him anymore like so much can happen if just a few months! Imagine what a few years would be. Yeah it'd feel like an eturnity. I just dont think I really could.&nbsp;I mean I can picture myself marrying him but not breaking up for some time and then goin back out.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Then theres just all this stuff like what I can do and cant do, while we are seperated. I dont know what our standards are, but like last night when we were talking he kept saying when I broke up with you. Thats all he kept saying.&nbsp; I just hope that hes not trying to break up slowly or trying to break it off as easy as possible, because I would just preferr that we just break up and me not have to feel like this anymore and just start to get on with my life. There is no easy way to break it off with a person you have been with for so long. I kno people think there are easy ways to break it off but really the trueth is, is that there's not an easy way. You may spend alot of time figuring out how to break up with someone and not&nbsp;hurt there feelings or change&nbsp;on what they would think of&nbsp;you after, but thats life and thats people. No matter how much time&nbsp;you&nbsp;spend telling them that its not there fault why you guys broke up, they are still gunna feel like it&nbsp;is. They are gunna get mad happy sad lonely. But thats the way it goes theres no stopping it or try to make&nbsp;it a better break up. There's just no way there is an easy break up.&nbsp;See last night I felt kinda like he actually&nbsp;was breaking up with me so I dont kno. I just dont want to spend alot of time hoping and wishing on something thats not gunna happen.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>So thats the wonderful life of Timmy! Sounds so fun.....dont you want to be in it?&nbsp; I dont think so either. Im just kinda starting to think that we are gunna actually break up, the way that he keeps looking at things. I just dont kno anymore. Ive just been holding on to this last hope and what he's been saying to me I think he does want to break up, and now I starting to lose that one last hope that I have been holding on to. I feel like Im holding on to with all my might and I just keep slipping and now Im at the end of the rope and I dont want to let go. Rhi I love you U being there for me and Deb.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>Rhi-&nbsp;You know how u said that we were ment for eachother and that everything will be fine,&nbsp;before you got out of the car. Well we might be&nbsp;ment for eacht other but I dont think we were ment for eachother now. I dont know what to believe or wish or hope for. I want to be with him but&nbsp;if he dont feel the same then I dont want to be with someone like that.&nbsp;I thank you from the bottom of my heart! I love you, no matter what happens between me and mike u still are goin to call me and hang out with me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffcc00>Deb- That night that I was so upset. If you werent there to talk to me and calm me down I dont know what could have happened or where I would be right now. You guys have made me realize alot about what Mike is going through, and calmed me down <STRONG><U>alot.</U></STRONG> I dont want to stop talking or whatever if me and mike do break up or what not. I LOVE YOU GUYS SOO MUCH!!!!!!! </FONT></P>"

Well sorry to bust ur bubble dude were not suppose to be talking so why are you talking to me, u just blew up at me in ur lj and u blew up at me on the phone earlier when i wanted to ask you some questions about this seperation thing and you bitched me out. you kno how confusing that does to a person? i dont think so. i kno u want time to ur self and shit, but bring me down with ur sister when ive bent over backwards and ask y i cant do this simple favor for you and how u did so much for us. well u should look at what we all do for u. like the play none of ur friends went ur boyfriend and sister cuz u wanted the extra credit and sat during a lame play( with u and debbie the best actors) just for you! who are do u think u need to break free from?? i told u in the begining that i didnt want to come over alot and look what happened u wanted me over all the time and see what it did?? An how can u expect a person to change over night when u just heard from the person u love say that basically, they want u to act like u never kne the person was alive. Like u never met or even seen them. sorry a person cant change just of a snap of a finger. a person can try the best they can at it."

That's about all...ohhh, I slept in the camper with Michael which was fun and cold but he kept me warm. Then I went home got ready and took me and my brother a hair cut and when we got back my dad yelled at me because I tipped the stylist $6 for cutting our hair and he yelled about that. So I go to Mike's house and then we all got into a fight and I left, because I was havin a bad day as it was. So I went to my brothers for a b-day party and me and my brother got into it about politics (Bush/Kerry), so I got all heated up and left. Then Lovely Sunday I woke up called Eesh to come over. We smoked so much this morning. Then at 2:00 I went to my sisters to have a turkey dinner and I ate soo much that my tummy is still full!&nbsp;Then I came home and found out that Mike called me so I called him back and he wanted me to come over, to tell me stuff about whats happened with Rocky. As I was driving there I was thinkin that maybe he was gunna break up with me, because he hasn't been as happy and ""himself"". Well I get there and he told me about Rocky and then he was like ""and ummm"", so I knew or had a feeling that something was gunna happen or be said. He said that he didnt want to keep me on the second burner and that he wanted to seperate, because he dont kno who he is anymore or what he wants and he loves me but he just dont want to treat me bad, which I understand and agree. But I dont know how long I can last. Thats the problem...."

"event","Well today started off like shit. The roofing guys came over and started on the roof, which I might add at 7:15 in the morning. Woke up to rumbling and abunch of noise! Well then I went to take a shower, then Krystal was on line and I was talking to her for awhile. Then I got off and she called me and asked if I wanted to come over. So I went over there. We smoked and then Michael woke up. Little after that we decided to play ""Twister Moves"", that was fun but I kinda got sick of playing that. Then Krystal and Celina went with Pam to go pay the bills while me and Michael stayed there. We had some alone time for awhile then he went into the shower. Crystal Carmen called and asked if Michael was there and I told her that he was in the shower, so she asked what we were doin tonight and I said that I had no clue. I figured that she wanted to see if Michael wanted to go to the club, which I was right. So later that night I get back from going to the store to get smokes and come to find out I was a dollar short! What luck. So I go back there and I told Krystal and Michael that I was a dollar short, so Krystal the kind girl she is went and found me a dollar. So we were gunna go get smokes when Michael asked me if I wanted to go with him to get Crystal. I really didnt want to go because it was a long drive and I didnt feel like goin. But Michael got piss and so I went figuring we all were gunna hang out. Well we get to Crystals house and she said she had to waite for this guy, and I also find out that they are goin to the club and were not hanging out. Krystal is in the car while were in there, so I went out to keep her company and plus I was irratated. So then after like 20 minutes goes by Michael decides to come out and ask to have the rest of my ciggarette or hit it and I was like whatever take it. Then after 10 minutes goes by Crystal comes out and says that the guy will be there in 15 minutes and she wanted to go to this cemetary. We went there and looked around and went back. Well he still wasnt there so another 15 minutes goes by and were still waiting for this guy. Im really pissed because we have been there for an hour already when I thought it was only gunna be a half hour thing. It wasnt! So we finally leave and got back to krystal's house I'm like so piss off cuz it took and hour and were not hanging out with them and they had to leave by 10:15 or be there so we didnt hang out at all which I would have prefered then waite at Crystal's for an hour. We finally get there and its like 9:30 and they were talking bout the club there goin to and I asked where, they said the ""mailbox"" I heard that that place was dirty and discusting and there are quite a bit of diseases around there. I tell them that I dont think they should go there because of it and they were like no its not like that. Then&nbsp;I went to the bathroom and I hear Crystal say that Michael could do this jock thing and go on stage with a see-through underwear thing on and all the guys and everyone sees u. Then Krystal told me that when Crystal said that Michael said that he wasnt goin to do it. Which I believe that he wont or do anything that hes not suppose to. So I got even more piss cuz Crystal told him to do that and I already dont trust Crystal as it is.....well I do but then I dont. Its weird. So before Michael and them left he was gunna leave without giving me a kiss and I was like give me a kiss and he told me to come to him...well I always go to him and kiss him when I leave so why cant he do it to me when he leaves?? Well then me and Krystal talked and I realized that I was being and asshole to him and I dropped krystal off and I decided to call Rhi's cell to tell Michael that I overreacted and I was being and asshole and to also say sorry, but noone answered. So I have to waite to say sorry to him tomorrow. But that was my Friday night. Exciting, huh?"

I wish I would have went back, but I want to graduate with my class and with my friends. But thats not gunna happen. When people say something about being a loser cuz u dropped out or make comments or even just joking around it hurts my feelings, because I don't want to be known as a loser because I dropped out of school. People have to do what they gotta do, and thats what I have to do. I dont want to graduate when I'm 21. I really miss my choir geeks. I really and truely miss them. I miss all of my friends in the hall ways. If I could I would turn back time and not horse around in school and took it alot more seriously, just so I could graduate and be with my friends when&nbsp;were seniors. I hate growing up, because now you have alot of decisions to make and you dont know if&nbsp;they are the right ones or not. Then you&nbsp;worry about the outcome of it.

Then Chris and Michael got matching silver band toe-rings that made me kinda weary at first when I heard about it. I gave him his SECOND promise ring and its too big, but it fits his thumb so thats where it is and probably will stay. Then he put his toe-ring on his finger where his promise rings suppose to go and I was like ummm shouldn't that be on ur toe and he said that he wanted to wear it but couldnt cuz his socks so he put it on his finger. I also felt weary about that too, cuz that the finger that his ring that I GOT HIM is suppose to be on. Is it just me or would you feel the same way. Let me know thanxs.&nbsp; I GOTTA JOB LAWN CUTTING ALSO I GET PAID $300 PLUS A WEEK. YAY!YAY!YAY!YAY!YAY!"

Yes four damn times it was sick. Then the next day we went to the woods and climbed on fallin dead trees that were above about 3 foot water. That was fun, then when we got to the other side we walked around the woods and found a path, so we took it and it lead out to the other side of the woods where we started, we left and went back to the house and I of course took a nap with noah!! That was fun we slept about the same time,and then at night we made the bomb fire and we smoked. Third day we all got up in the morning and got ready. Then by 1:00 we left and got home around 4:00. I went home then got u kno and smoked sence we didnt have alot when we went up there for three days! I got really stoned, then I hear that Rocky wants to talk to curtain friends like Mike and Randa to be friends and say sorry for bein immature, because he was getting jealous that we were hanging out with Crystal carmen, and said shit bout us. So Michael is prolly over there and Im bout to go smoke a bowl and smoke a ciggy and pass the fuck out... peace</P>

When I got there I was Piss off, because I was late for my 1st hour. Then Krys came up to me and said that they didnt know that they had to pick me up today, because she said that Mike said that he was picking me up in the morning. Why the hell would I go to school at fucking 7:00 in the morning???? I dont get it. Then I was talking to Randa in 2nd hour about it and she said that Shannon said that I have no right to get mad....... Hello.... I didnt have a ride to school and she always takes me to school in the morning,why couldnt they stop by and see it would have only took two seconds to run up to my door and see if I was there. so why not today??? Then at lunch I was talking about it and Mike didnt say anything about it. So when I finally seen Shannon I went up to her and said that I did have a right to be piss off and then Mike butted in and said that I didnt have to get mad. I just looked at him and just said bye to them both. I was too piss off at her and Michael for saying that. So I went to class to calm down alil and to come back and talk but they left of course. Why didnt he say that I should be mad at Krys instead of Shannon at lunch when I was talking about it??? I really dont get that either."

Then in school we were fighting on and off then we had a Concert at 6:00. Mike had to stay after school til quarter to 5:00, which sucked because I wanted to cuddle and love him for alil bit before we had to all leave for the Concert. But that didnt happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :( Then I figured that I would tell my mom that I would be home around 11:30 so that way Michael and I could have some alone time and make love and cuddle, but no one could go over there so he had to take Crystal and I home. I got home around 10:25 which kinda sucked because this is the only time I could get out this late and I came home an hour early. I know, I know, no one could stay at Michaels because it was already 10:00 and they wanted to get to bed. I understand completely. So that was my day. I had some good times in between all that other stuff, but it could have been alot better."

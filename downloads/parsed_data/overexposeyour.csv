"event","so I pretty much had the worst christmas in recorded history.

besides the fact that it was really awkward on xmas eve (at my grandparents with my drunk mom and dad, who are separated and rarely talk) things really only got worse the next morning.

I woke up feeling ill.  we opened presents and then my dog started acting weird (Emma, not Dylan).  We rushed her to the emergency vet and she wasn't able to stand up, much less move by the time we got there-the closest place was castleton.

so, Emma had bloat, which is fatal, so we decided to put her down because she was suffering immense amounts of pain.  It was heart wrenching and terrible and I cried pretty much non stop the whole day.  Jesus I'm even starting to tear up writing this now.

She was the best dog.  She was fat and smelly in her old age, but she loved everybody and all she ever wanted was someone to scratch her butt and give her a snack.  So here's to Emma, the sweetest dog ever. So all in all, my christmas fucking blew.

RIP Emma, 1996-2008"

"event","so today I read that Bush regrets some of the things he's said over the course of the past 8 years.  No shit dude?  I guess I have to give him some credit, at least he doesn't think  he's spewed words of brilliance that inspired millions.  & he is maybe rethinking that ""Mission Accomplished"" banner.  Apparantely Laura has been calling him on his shit.  Good job ol' girl.

On a similar subject, James Franco is the Stoner of the Year.  What does that title even mean?  Do you have duties?  Or is the only requirement to be stoned when yr accepting the award?  Hm.

"event","probably don't talk to me today, because I'm most likely to rage out on you about politics.

but if you aren't voting, seriously GTFO, because you are an awful American citizen.  & I'm totally serious about that.  You can't take an hour to go push some buttons?  You couldn't google some issues?  You ""forgot"" about registering when Obama staffers were waving the apps in your face?  Puh-leaze.  No excuses, get out there and VOTE, motherfuckers!

This determines your future, our future, your children's future.  What is more important than that?  

Soooooo......VOTE!"

"event","so maybe you saw my angry myspace bulliten about blockbuster.&nbsp; but&nbsp;maybe you didn't, so I'll just go ahead and have a bitch fest&nbsp;here on lj.

Last Tuesday I received an automated voice call from Blockbuster telling me that my movies had&nbsp;to be&nbsp;returned by Friday or I would be charged the full price for them.&nbsp; The movies were Transformers &amp; one disc of Curb Your Enthusiasm.&nbsp; So, the next day (Wednesday) sometime probably between 9 and 10:30 pm, I returned to blockbuster with BOTH movies in hand.&nbsp; I walk in the store.&nbsp; I place them in the drop box.&nbsp; I find more movies, check them out, etc.

Saturday rolls around and I receive&nbsp;yet another call from BB.&nbsp; This time, however,&nbsp;they tell&nbsp;me&nbsp;that because I've chosen to keep the movies past due date, I will be charged the full price for them.&nbsp; Clearly confused, as I had returned the movies, I call the BB store and an employee tells me that it may be a mistake and to mention something if&nbsp;it shows up on my record the next time I am in the store.

I go back on Sunday and they let me check out two movies, no problem.&nbsp; I assume the problem was a mistake.

Wednesday I go back and try to rent a movie.&nbsp; Bitchy Mcbitch at the counter sneers and tells&nbsp;me I havent returned two movies and owe them a large sum of money (20 something bucks,&nbsp;I'm poor!!).&nbsp; I explain to Mcbitch that I returned the movies, and ON TIME, last&nbsp;Wednesday night.&nbsp; Matt is there and he&nbsp;vouches that yes, I did put the movies in the box.&nbsp; ""Uh, well, we already scanned the store on Thursday, so it's not here.""&nbsp; and gives me this&nbsp;disgusted look.&nbsp; Shift manager comes over and tells her to go look for the movie, she sighs and&nbsp;sounds disgusted, but goes to look.&nbsp; Not there.

Well, I say.&nbsp; If I returned it in the box, how is it my fault it's not there?&nbsp; Neither of them have a real response.

They tell me to&nbsp;come talk to a manager the next day, and MAYBE, maybe I can get it taken off my account.

So now.&nbsp; Because BB has lost the dvd's I returend on time, in the proper recepticle, I will most likeluy have to pay them this money.&nbsp;&nbsp; Im going in to talk to the manager once I get off of work, but we'll see.

SO.&nbsp; my advice to all of you is this-&nbsp; When you return a dvd, make sure you return it during business hours, and make sure th employees scan it in in front of you.&nbsp; Then ask for a receipt saying that you returned it.

this is the only sure way you will not be accused of lying &amp; stealing from this EVIL corporation.

OR

you could just avoid BB all together.&nbsp; Do you really want to rent from a place that stocks 200 copies of ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry?"" &amp; accuses you of stealing the most overhyped overrated movie of 2007 (Transformers...BLEHHH)

SERIOUSLY??!!!

ps.&nbsp; oh &amp; I'm 2000% sure that I DID indeed return the movies, to the right store.&nbsp; not a shadow of doubt in my mind, so it is in no way ""my fault"""

"event","So in other news (in terms of music), I pushed my music library past the milestone 3250 songs today to 3275 total, 9.7 days of music, with the download of Peter Gabriel's album entitled ""Up."" That is a LOT of music.

New favorite: The 5 Browns - Call me a dork if you will...

""Handsome, charming, articulate and close-knit, this youthful quintet of brothers and sisters are all virtuosic concert pianists. Each of the Browns has a distinctive and discriminating keyboard talent, honed at New York's Juilliard School where for five consecutive years they studied simultaneously. They have chosen to cast their lot together as a unique quintet of classical pianists, performing on five grand pianos and in various ensemble combinations.""

P.S. I don't know who has and hasn't heard of P.G. Wodehouse and his series of short stories and novels, but they have been put into a television series, and Stephen Fry plays Jeeves. Now he is the funniest person I think I have ever heard of, barely (but still) in front of John Cleese. Allow me to display partial reasoning for this exclaimation:

Fry, upon being asked about Jeeves' mannerisms and such: ""Wodehouse described Jeeves' cough as 'like a sheep clearing its throat of a blade of grass on a distant hillside.' I tried practicing that but sounded more like a goat clearing its throat of a piece of cheese on a nearby hillside. These things are difficult.""

Fry, still on the same topic: ""Servants never knock on doors, they just go straight in, and they should never register emotion. So if you were to walk into a room and there were three people naked throwing doughnuts at each other, you would merely say dinner is served.""

Right. Happy 4th, everyone, because I probably won't update again before then."

I thought life might slow down a bit after school ended, but nooooooo. That would make life too easy. And we couldn't have that. Oh well. it's not too bad. And I don't really care. I jsut care that whenever I get a day to rest or something of similar rarity, my parents are on top of me being like ""you should go call your boss, see if you can do some work, earn some money"" and I'm like NOOO GET AWAY FROM ME! Blah. Oh well.

So this weekend's been okay. Yesterday was amazing. I took two SAT IIs in the morning, which didn't go too badly, then I went to watch Amy/Jimmy in their track meet, but I didn't see them race/jump because their first events were before I got there, and then the meet got canceled because it was raining so hard and their equipment was doing strange things. Anyway, after that i wan't to play a concert for the governor in Augusta, which went fairly well. I learned a new instrument afterward, which was pretty cool. Anywho, I came home and watched master and commander, which was good. Today sucked, mostly because I was home all day with nothing to do, and I tried to call Julia to see if she wanted to do something but she wasn't home. Sooooooooo I spent the majority of the day listening to Pink Floyd, Neil Young, and Billy Joel, and NOT going to graduation because my parents are @*#$%!@s! grr.

So I've decided that I hate communicating over the internet, because with few exceptions, messages and the like are never a true representation of the person, and I don't like that, even though I know what they're really like. Don't ask me why...

I was looking at some of my old journal entries and saw that:
a)I whined a crapload - if I'm still doing that, someone please LJ slap me in the face.
b)I was stupid
c)I was just...different. Reading those, I was almost thinking ""I wrote that? That doesn't sound like me at all..."" On the other hand, that might just be because online writing does that anyway."

"event","First week back to school wasn't too bad. I don't think I ate lunch in the cafeteria from tuesday onward, but whatever. drama's been fun so far. crew is good too.

Friday night after school I hung out with Amy and Abby before rehearsal, which was pretty fun/amusing. Then I went to rehearsal, at which Alison was present, and we perfected our 2-person empty pockets technique (v. 1 - simpler), and yeah. then I went home, called abby, but the conversation went nowhere so i hung up. Today I had a drumline show, which went amazingly well, and it was the last one, which makes it better that we did better...you know what i mean? maybe not...oh well. Yeah. tomorrow I have a piano lesson, and soccer practice. And then homework and back to school. And the only major thing I have before New York is a history test, which i'm really nervous about. But whatever.

Monday I have crew/drum lesson, tuesday drama/DL concert Auburn. Further bulletins as events warrant."

Sunday: Piano Lessons/Soccer Practice + Homework (because i never do it earlier)

Tuesday: School/Homework + Drama + EL Drumline
Wednesday: School/Homework + Drama + PYWE
Thursday: School/Homework + Crew* + Soccer Practice
Friday: School + Drama + 3rd ME
Saturday: Drumline Show

still busy as hell and loving it! i've also been recruited by a bagpipe band in York, ME and one in Andover, MA. I'd love to do either one, but i kind of have to wait until my schedule thins out a little bit. As for this summer, I've been asked to consider touring with 3 different DCI groups - the 7th Regiment (DCI Div. III CT), Atlantic Guardian (DCI Div. III ME), and the Citations (DCI Div. III MA). But that consists of a) money, b) being stuck on a bus from mid-july to late august, c) foregoing jazz camp, and d) skipping family vacation. although i'm considering touring in a Div. II corps next year - i'm not this year because auditions already passed, plus the tour is longer so i'd have to miss Deep River. which wouldn't be good. blah.

VACATION SUCKS

got to condo friday night, unpacked, slept.
saturday: went dh skiing at sunday river with little brother (uber fun - seriously)
sunday: did absolutely nothing because there was no snow on the ground, i had nobody to go dh skiing with, and yeah. talked with abby on the phone for a long time. through the course of the day, watched drumline, school of rock, and madagascar.
monday: did absolutely nothing because there was no snow on the ground, i had nobody to go dh skiing with, and yeah. talked with amy on the phone for a long time. through the course of the day, watched canadian bacon (super funny) and animal house (also super funny).
tuesday: awesome, because amy saw fit to relieve me from my state of extreme boredome. went to her house, abby came, and we partied in auburn all day, and then had dinner at costa vida's in south portland, which was good, with the plus that i got to skip drumline. got home, talked with abby on the phone for a REALLY long time, watched rent, slept.
wednesday: woke up (just kidding...?), finished rent, i'm doing this, and abby's picking me up in a few minutes to go bowling with her, jimmy, caroline, will, amy, and maybe jenna. yeah. tonight i have crap to do. tomorrow morning, back to bethel. we might ski. but so far, everywhere is ""closed pending further notice"" because there is NO FUCKING SNOW ANY FUCKING WHERE!

and some time in the next half week, i have to do my history homework, finish a book for english, work on an art project, annnnnd prepare for a drumline show that i have in lewiston on saturday.

wow. that was still kind of short...ish...i'm proud of myself."

While nearly everyone else in my school is enjoying beach and sun on some tropical island, i'll be skiing on man-made snow in negative temperatures! whoohoo! there's no natural snow, so there won't be any x-c skiing, which means i'll be bored for half the week. downhill skiing will be fun, but i'll be skiing alone, so it won't be as fun. except jimmy might come up for two days. i dunno. i might try to get amy and abby up for a day - but abby is now fervently against skiing of any type, so i don't know how that'll work. pete's in florida. rob doesn't ski. alison won't want to. everyone else is in some foreign and/or otherwise far-away place. oh well.

"event","It's finally vacation. FINALLY. took sooooooooo long to get here. and now it's going to wiz by. but oh well. might as well enjoy it. last night we had an advisee ""get-together"" at flatbreads. beforehand i just stuck around for a couple hours and hung out with amy/abby, and when they left, caroline/jimmy. anywho. flatbread was good. got home. stayed up watching monty python. woke up at 11 this morning. felt sooooo good. through the day, i painted a picture, taped my drumsticks black, sat around, and then discovered that the leftover paint (acryllic) was still wet (after 2 hours?), so i painted my hands, but i didn't like what i painted, so i rubbed the pictures out. That resulted in one of my hands looking like a zombie's, and the other looking like it was severely frostbitten. Yeah....

Tomorrow i have a show for drumline @westbrook HS. should be interesting considering that 2/4 snare drummers have no idea what's going on.

Sunday i have lessons/soccer practice/nothingness.

then monday-thursday i have nothing except my normal e-c activities. so that'll be nice....although i don't know what i'm going to do with myself. friday i leave for - wait for it *holds breath* - Bethel! skiing all week! it'll be my second time on fucking snow. it's kind of ridiculous. but i'm looking forward to it. except i'll most likely be skiing alone because my dad doesn't dh ski, and nobody else is willing to drive all the way to bethel. damn it all. but oh well. i'm still happy. because i love it up there. i hope their x-c center gets snow though. if they don't, at least half of my week will consist of me sitting in the condo in front of the fire watching movies all day. oh well. i will just have to pray.

In other news:
For the spring season I am in Twelfth Night, AND doing crew at Waynflete. I don't know how i'm goign to pull that off, but i'll manage. I'm sebastian in Twelfth, which isn't exactly the part I wanted, and apparently I got it because I look like the person who's playing Viola...but I'm okay with it. whatever.

I vented a couple of nights ago. to a person previously mentioned in this journal. it went pretty well. nothing unexpected came out. and i felt really light headed afterwords....which could have been good or bad, i don't really now. but i think my life is starting to resolve. although i'm piling more crap on top of my schedule. but in terms of teenage drama, etc....sort of. there are still some things (not to be discussed here) that need to be ironed out. but I don't feel like locking myself in a room and shooting myself for all the problems that were circulating anymore (no, i was not/am not suicidal - it was a mental sort of thing).

"event","so when did i last update this? whatever. last weekend was absurdly uneventful. Friday night i went to rehearsal as usual. Saturday, i got up at 7 and got to nya at 8 so we could go skiing at sunday river. but i got there, and what did we discover? sunday river had no snow! so we ended up haveing a ""team lunch/olympics-watching"" party at pete's. came back, did nothing. sunday, i went skating down on the pond for a while, but otherwise i didn't do anything.

Monday we left for states. We didn't actually have to leave until 10:30, so we got to sleep in on a race day, which is amazing because it happens, like, once per season if not less. anywho, we got there and discovered that there was no natural snow there either. turns out that black mountain had been making snow on the mountain and pushing it down onto the x-c trails. it was pretty intense. Anywho, upon arrival, we were informed that we were going to have to ski high school hill (the biggest hill on the face of the plant - maybe....) twice because there was only snow on one 2.25 km loop. but the race went alright.

We went back to the Inn at the Rostay and had dinner, which was amazingly good. then we rented movies had parties and stuff like that. Tuesday, since there wasn't a race, we hung around, napped, played laser tag in a 3-story arena, and made fun of all the kids back at home who had school. In the evening, we had more excellent dinner, rented more movies, and waxed for wednesday's race.

Wednesday we woke up at 5:30, packed up in roughly 10 minutes, went for a 10-minute run around town, and got back in time for a really good breakfast. We checked out of the inn by 6:30 and went to the course. we were the first there, so we just hung around for a while and ate goldfish. The race came and went. mine sucked. i fell once coming DOWN HS hill. But i was facing the right direction so that i just pulled myself up in under a second - but i think i did it too fast, because then i fell flat on my face...yeah. Then we had the awards ceremony. Freeport pretty much swept up everything. and what they didn't take, wayneflete did. Ingrid got 2nd in the classical. yeah. Lucy got 1st place in both, and Lucas got 1st place in both. damn them.

Right. i got home, did some homework, took a nap (didn't help at all), did some more homework, took a shower, did some more homework, and now i'm doing this. and now i'm going to go eat dinner. And after dinner, i'm going to stay up tunil 11:30 watching the best of Monty Python!!!!

And in another side note: I've been downhill skiing once this season. it's really depressing - especially since i got brand new skis at the beginning of the season. i love them, but alas, have had no opportunities. so if anyone goes skiing (or at least finds a place with snow)....

I'm maintaining my As in school, amazingly, even though i don't really do homework anymore. kind of makes me wonder how well i could do if i actually tried...oh well.

In other news: last week were WMCs, which went relatively well. I beat the people i wanted to beat. So I'm happy enough. Next monday-wednesday are states, which i'm pretty excited for - mostly because it means the end of the season.

Last weekend was really cool. I got back from my race in rangely just in time to see my friends in the drama performance. Afterwords, I was hunted down and invited to the drama cast party/sleepover, which was somewhat akward because a) I was one of three guys/10+ girls, and b) because i was the only non-drama person there. Apparently i'm an honorary member, given that i'm there after ski practices most days. anyway, the party was fun. I met some new people who, despite going to my relatively small school, i still didn't know. When we got there we just hung around and talked, and eventually made our way downstairs and watched Rocky Horror. afterwords, we just sat down in katie's basement and talked until 4 am or so...

Midwinter jam got cancelled because of bad weather. made me really depressed. on the other hand, i didn't have much homework, so i had a few hours to relax. 

I've gotten maybe 9 hours of sleep combined since saturday night. between parties, homework, and the olympic, it's just been crazy. i'm pretty tired, but i'm also hoping that once i get back to the regular schedule of going to bed at 1, it won't feel as bad.

yeah. my random thoughts...

"event","So....this weekend capped off what was quite possible one of the worst weeks of my life. but we're not going to go into that. I had a great weekend to compensate for it. My ski race was cancelled, so I had a free saturday, and no obligations ALLLLLLL day! It felt amazing. I did nothing. I ate, slept, watched blast, in which i saw these crazy stick things that i've decided that i have to learn, and slept some more. Today, i had a piano lesson, which wasn't disastrous, and i played video games for 2 hours (something that I haven't done since 6th grade). There was homework, of course, but even that was bearable. I finished my art project too, and now that i've filled in the background, the creature on the front actually kind of looks like a person. it's amazing....not really, but whatever.

Tomorrow it's back to the old monotony. next sunday is midwinter jam in arlington!!!! I'm SO excited!!! I will be counting the days, which will cause the week to go even slower...oh well!

I had a concert on thursday, which went really well considering we had only worked on the pieces for 3 rehearsals. Supposedly we were the best out of the four groups that performed, but i didn't hear the others because i was hanging out with julia and jenna in the deep recesses and dark corners of Gorham high school rather than sitting in the audience like i was supposed to be....and to confirm, no, we weren't doing drugs or anything wierd like that...

right. that was rather long-winded."

You know you've been studying Latin for too long when:
1. you've learned more grammar in Latin class than you have in English
2. you start identifying subjunctive clauses in normal conversation
3. you can translate the monks' theme from Monty Python
4. you can translate other random ancient monks' hymns
5. you subconsciously use Latin exclamations and words of inquiry
6. you consciously quote Cicero in normal conversations...IN Latin
7. the worst one: you hear latin on ""Prarie Home Companion"" and you can
     a) Identify it as Cicero's First Catilinarian Oration
     b) Speak along with it, and finally
     c) translate it

"event","guess i haven't updated in a bit. might as well. because i have no more homework. That's right! I have no random, far-away place to go tonight, i don't have a shitload of homework, and so i'm actually sitting at home, doing something that is a complete waste of time! I'm so happy!

Anyway. So when was the last time i updated? before new years? something like that. so we had a new year's party. which turned out to be kind of a disaster which involved amy's mom freaking out, kathleen, amy, and tess leaving, and me, pete, abby, and silas sticking around, watching the ball drop, scaring abby by pretending that there was something moving in the woods outside her house, and watching pete dance while letting air out of balloons. it was quite entertaining, i suppose. 

As for other events:
We've had three ski races, all of which i've done horribly in.
I went to see the producers, which was very funny (may i take your hats, coats....and....swastikas?), with abby.

I think that's about it for interesting stuff. yeah, my life is pretty boring. and hectic. or hell-tic.

I took the time today, for the first time ever, to look at how much music i have on my computer. I have a whopping 2633 songs, 8.1 days of music. is that crazy or what?"

"event","training camp was a blast in so many ways. The snow was amazing (there was 3 1/2 feet!), so the skiing was excellent, and we got to train right along side with U.S. Olympic hopefuls.

The accomodations were excellent. We had a little cabin (which nearly got destroyed, but that comes later) which was very cozy and comfortable. Although the TV only got one channel, which happened to be playing James Bond 24/7 for 8 days straight. So that was rather convenient.

Tuesday was alright and pretty uneventful. The 6-hour car ride to Presque Isle was torturous, but then we got to ski at an empty MWSC for 3 hours in beautiful snow, so it was worth it. Afterwords, we ate dinner at this amazing place in PI called The Slopes. The restaurant was huge, and practically empty, and the food was amazing. After dinner we went up to Ft. Kent and settled in.

Wednesday was pretty great. In the morning we went to breakfast in town, which was wicked good. We found great entertainment in listening to people talking in French, or people talk about people they knew, and how they wouldn't mind taking a gun to their head. After breakfast we went skiing at MWSC Ft. Kent, which was amazing, because a)the snow was beautiful, and b)the U.S. olympic hopefuls were all there training, so we got to meet a great many of them. After sking, we went back to the cabin for lunch. During lunch, we began to smell something rather strange. Upon entering the bedroom, we found it to be incredibly smoky. Then simon realized that he had left his plastic glasses case on the furnace. So we removed it, put it outside, and scraped off as much of the melted plastic as we could. the house didn't smell regular again until Friday. We eventually had to disconnect the smoke detector too. Anyway, after that ordeal, we went skiing again, which was uneventful, except that sarah fell and sprained her wrist, so her father, who was also the boys' chaperone, had to take her to a hospital in Presque Isle. So we left, and Zach dropped us off at our cabin, and then we realized that Bill had the key. We spent an hour attempting to break in, and finally, in hardcore nordic fashion, ran (as in ran, not rushed) up the ridiculously long, steep driveway to the main lodge to try to get an extra key. Bill came back just as we were walking out the front door with our spare key.

Thursday was pretty good. Satisfying, at least. Same routine in the morning. the house still smelled like smoke. In the morning we went to watch the biathlon, which was good, but it was raining, so the course was incredibly thick. The women's race was really good. the guys race was good too, although russel currier got disqualified because he took a wrong turn on the course. after the race we went to lunch, which was uneventful. Then in the afternoon we went skiing again, which was disastrous because by that time, everything was ice. We met up with yarmouth and skied next to them because they were going the same way that we were. Somewhere in the course just before we turned off, my ski pole happened to slip on the ice and stab a kid, who had just happened to make fun of me at the previous night's dinner, in the nuts. Anyway, after skiing, we had nothing to do, so we went into Ft. Kent to look around. me, pete, pete, wes, simon, and sam all decided to take a visit across the border. so we checked in with the customs guy and he said it was alright. so we went over THE bridge and took a picture in front of the sign that said ""bienvenue au Canada!"" and then went back. Later that night we began plotting a prank in which we sam could not get back across the border because he didn't have an ID, and so the coach would have had to get him. we got quite a few laughs in the evening on that subject, modifying it to levels of absurdity, such as pretending he had gotten kidnapped by the mountees.

Friday morning I foreran the race, which is a big deal in skiing terms. MWSC selected 4 boys and 4 girls to go our before the racers and pack down/confirm the course. I was lucky to be one. Anyway, after that i joined the rest of my team in the bleachers to watch the race. At this point, it was no longer raining, but snowing in blizzard magnitude and very windy. i ended up watching most of the race from inside. After the race we got to shoot on the range. The first time i got 4, and then i was loading and accidentally brushed the trigger, causing the gun to fire and the bullet to hit the roof of the structure. it made a really funny noise too. Someone hit a flagpole and caused the swiss flag to go crooked and start sliding down the pole. hehehehe. anyway, the second time i went clean (got all 5). Then we had to endure that 8 hour car ride from Ft. Kent back to yarmouth.


I guess i have some sort of new year's ""party"" to go to in 6 hours. should be a good time. right now i have nothing to do, so i think i'm going to work on my art project or something.

P.S. I got Queen's ""A night at the opera"" yesterday. made me very happy.

P.P.S. I didn't use a single ellipsis in this entire disgustingly long-winded, unorganized entry! I'm so proud of myself!


Happy New Year!"

"event","Christmas was pretty good. got plenties of stuff.

I got:
CDs: Middlesex County Volunteers: Guardian Angels; The Essential Electric Light Orchestra; Rusted Root: Cruel Sun; something by a Brittish drum corps; The Best of 10CC
Books: The American West; and a whole bunch of other stuff.
DVDs: SNL: 25 Years of Music - 5 vol. set; THE WHO!!!!
A case for my beautiful Cooperman!!!
A lovely, shiny G-Clef tie
A lovely, shiny Canada tie
A pair of piano socks...
New DH skis
A couple of music-oriented novelties such as notpads and playing cards.

So it was a pretty good christmas overall. Although it rained all last night and today, thouroughly ruining the snow.

I did so much work today, it was dismal. I woke up at 10:30, which felt incredibly good. I proceeded to start working on my art project, for which, after searching for appropriate material, i realized i would hve to compose my own song. So i went out to the piano with the sole intention of picking out a tune and scribbling it down. I ended up sitting out there for an hour and plunking around. i made up yet another good intro to a song. so i've got, like, 20 intros to use. now i need to figure out middles and ends.... Anywho, then abby called and wanted to know if i could go bowling. I was unfortunately inclined to refuse, given my workload. After i got off the phone with her, i came back out and composed a 3-layered slide, which took 2 hours. then I made another one out of construction paper, but it was incredibly detailed, so it took me a really long time.

And pretty soon, i have to go pack for Nordic training camp! We get to go up to caribou to eat, sleep, ski, watch skiing, and shoot stuff for a week. 'twill undoubtedly be a blast.

And guess how far it is each way? i don't even know, but it's a 6-hour car ride. that's how long it takes to get from here to New York....But once you get through two hours (to presque isle), the highway runs out, and it's all back roads and dirt roads from there.

And when i get back at 10 pm on Dec. 30th, there might be some new year's eve plans waiting for me. At least i hope there will be.

Right. Off to pack!"

had a ""party"" at kathleen's on monday. it was pretty uneventful. We got there, opened presents, played, fusball, played music, watched the flaming lips, watched josie and the pussycats, and yeah. the presents were pretty cool. Beanie is, like, crazy at making stuff. And there were lots of hats to go around. and plenty of cds. and lots and lots of chocolate. mmmm. anyway, i got a tie, pants, a cd, annnnnnnd food. yeah. good stuff. anywho, at 9, me, amy, and abby went back to amy's house and just hung out there for an hour and a half-ish. then my dad picked me up. yeah. that's my life. the rest of the week went as follows:
tuesday: 9 am - 2:30 pm: boredom. 3 pm - 5 pm: ski practice. 6 pm - 8:30 pm: Edward Little DL

Abby motioned for me to come in and sing, but i had to get something, so I went down the hall, and met jimmy. we started singing stuff and i got totally sidetracked. I started to help him move his poinsettas to his car, but then Abby and Amy showed up. so abby went to help jimmy, and i stayed and absentmindedly said random things to Amy and to the occasional recognizeable personage who walked through the door. then I went back, sung, looked at cool ties, etc. after the craft fair we went to Abby's house. Abby was too lazy to walk, so she went in the car. Amy and I walked back to her house. then we went to auburn. we hung out at Amy's for a while, and then went to see Rent (AMAZING, btw) where we met Amy's friends Kathleen and Silas. Yeah. movie was good. We went back to Amy's, ate pizza, talked about random nonsense, and I went home.

Sunday i cleaned my room...

Today was pretty good. I woke up at 3:30, and by 4:30, i had figured out that i wasn't going to fall back alseep. so i went downstairs, ate breakfast, went down in the woods, took some nice pictures, read the paper, and other such things until my dad came down. Then i left for school. I had double art...in which i got next to nothing done. at break I wandered aimlessly around campus. Bio was utterly pointless, math was fun. I actually ate lunch - in the caffeteria!!!! - for the first time in several weeks! It was quite amazing. Student council put on this video about people trashing safford and the lounge. it was rather comical...anywho, latin was easy/boring, and by the time history rolled around, my brain was to dead to think at all. So I just sat there, looked busy, and colored with blue pen on my arm... After school I was late to ski practice because I got detention for not checking in....so I got there, and there was nobody there, so I went on an hour run by myself. And I managed to make my way all the way around yarmouth. I went from the westcustago inn to YHS to north road and back to NYA. lord knows how... Then I went and watched the drama people for a while, which was mildly entertaining. Afterwards, jimmy showed up, and we spent twenty minutes singing stuff. it was fun.

"event","Roight...soooooooo I'm bored - i actually got home at 5:30 today and managed to finish all my homework by 7:00. Astonishing.

Yesterday was a blast. Right after school I left to go to Edward Little for drum line. I got there a little early, so i got to play on one of the drums (which i had never ever played on before). They were soooooo amazing! I later found out that they are Yamaha prototypes of some sort, the only ones of their kind, except, of course, for the set used by the blue devils! Gah! that's so cool! Anywho. As it turns out, some people didn't show up, so we just counted as a practice, and not so much as an audition. So...yeah. It was fun. we just fooled around, listened to Bryon talk, which was very entertaining. Here are a few of my favorite quotes from that particular session:
""I am Pharaoh! And I hate poop...big, green, sticky wads of corn-filled poop!""
""I am like the ghost busters. Who you gonna call? Me!""
""I don't bite. I nibble. Like a little old grandmother...without the teeth...""

haaaaaaaaa. it was very entertaining. And of course, it went until 9:00, and it was in Auburn, and I stopped for dinner on the way home, so I didn't get home until 10:15 or so. Then I had to do my homework. But i didn't...because i had study hall, double math (always gets out super early), and free break to do that. so I just went to sleep.


Today was pretty boring. Got to school early, did homework, had math, where we worked on fun stuff on geometer's sketchpad for most of class, had break, went to higgins, did more homework, came back to find Abby in the hallway, just sorta standing there. So I stopped, began to talk. Amy came out, and they began discussing some mysterious christmas present involving soda cans. then Katie came with her camera, and started taking pictures of people's hands in various formations, etc....an activity which i did not bother to partake in. yeah. then latin, then history, then lunch, which i didn't attend...not that i ever really do, of course, but oh well. after lunch i had english, which was kind of interesting...we talked about political satire. it was fun...and then i had art for the last class, in which i wrote prettily on my project. After school, we had ski practice, in which four of us (the rest had rollerskis...) ran a 5 mile loop. We were SUPPOSED to go L1 (really easy pace). But we did the entire loop in just under 30 minutes...6 minute mile - not really easy pace. oh well. so we finished at four, and i went back and watched the drama rehearsal for an hour. then i just hung around and went home.

Wow. that was ridiculously long, ridiculously pointless, and now i will go wander in search of food, meanwhile praying that my mother gets back from Shaws sometime in the near future.

"event","so ski season has officially started...First practice was a rather rude awakening. We did intervals (5 on, 5 off) for an hour. that was unpleasant. then we did strength. That was pretty easy. and it was really pointless because our coach wasn't even there. He was sick, so he came at the beginning, told us what to do, and then left. I had better things to do...like see harry potter...but oh well.

As for the rest of the day:
had bio exam. rediculously easy. finished in 45 minutes (test was meant to take 1 1/2 hours). During break, i hung out in the chorus room, watching (with much amusement, I might add) the music theory people cramming for their exam. Then, my dad couldn't pick me up until 12:30, so:
I talked with amy for half an hour.
Walked around campus for 20 minutes.
Went back to higgins, found amy, and talked for another hour while waiting for abby to finish her exam.
Went home, ate food, wished i was watching harry potter with abby, amy, and co.

"event","I had my PYWE concert on Thursday. It was amazing.

To start, I was dismissed from school at 1:50. that's always a plus to add on to any day. but to get to the main stuff - the best part was the time between dress rehearsals (3:30-5:30). After the PYWE dress rehearsal, me and Jenna hung around the stage for a while and I played the piano.

*Just a note: playing in merrill auditorium when there is nobody there and the lights are dim is the most amazing experience ever.

We sat there for a while, and then went to look for something to eat. Outside the door, we met Julia, a percussionist, who, despite being in the same section, i hardly knew. so i talked with her for a while and then one of her friends came to pick her up for lunch, she invited me. The car ride was strange. The PPM was 100 yds down the street, but we went the wrong way and ended up driving all around portland listening to christmas music in her friends car. we finally got to the market, and went to Romeo's. We spent a while eating and talking and stuff. Then we went back to the concert hall and just hung around until the PYSO dress rehearsal.

PYWE was the first group to perform. We played all our pieces seemingly very well.

*Just a note: playing in merrill auditorium when there are lots of people are there and the lights are focused in the stage is equally amazing (especially when in a tuxedo - i feel so professional!)

But yeah. It was extraordinarily fun, and apparently, we sounded great. An excerpt from our review in the Portland Press Herald:

""Robert Schumann sad of Chopin: ""Hat's off, gentlemen, a genious."" I thought of those words when listening to the Portland Youth Wind Ensemble...[they] performed with a high degree of prefessionalism and more emotion than might have come from more experienced musicians...Think water-like rippling of flutes, and the bone-hollow sound of wood blocks - astonishingly well played.""

The reviewer later described us as ""stealing the show."" Snork. and guess who was on woodblock... Anywho, after the performance, I found Jenna and Julia, and then Alec found us, and we proceeded to loiter around the entrance and talk and sing and such. It was quite blastful. After the concert I talked to Julia for a while, and then found jenna and tried to find ways out of the rehearsal hall without getting crushed.

So...I'm really depressed now because I won't see a lot of the PYWE people for two months.


Rest of Weekend:
Friday: Played the veteran's day parade in portland with my F+D corps. it went pretty well. Except it was 36 degrees out. Now, being bundled in wool uniforms was nice for once. on the other hand, it's difficult to drum wityh gloves, so...half way through the parade, i couldn't feel the sticks in my hands...

oh yeah, and the captain isn't sure i'm entirely qualified to be a corporal...AH! He's going to take my stripes!

Saturday and Sunday: Absurdly Boring."

Here's what Jeff Foxworthy has to say on New Englanders:

If you consider it a sport to gather your food by drilling through 36 inches of ice and sitting there all day hoping it will swim by, you might live in New England.

If you're proud that your region makes the national news 96 nights each year because Mt. Washington is the coldest spot in the nation, and Boston gets more snow than any other major city in the US, you might live in New England.

If your local Dairy Queen is closed from September through May, you might live in New England.

If you instinctively walk like a penguin for six months out of the year, you might live in New England.

If someone in a Home Depot store offers you assistance, and they don't work there, you might live in New England.

If you've worn shorts and a parka at the same time, you might live in New England.

If you've had a lengthy telephone conversation with someone who dialed a wrong number, you might live in New England.



YOU KNOW YOU ARE A NEW ENGLANDER WHEN:

""Vacation"" means going anywhere south of New York City
for the weekend.

This week is getting worse by the minute. Everything that could go wrong is....and I'm just really tired. Tired of everything. Of school, of all my extracurricular activities (Edward Little HS Drumline is now on the list!), of people, of having emotional issues, and from an incredible lack of sleep. And now everything is stacking up. Next week on thursday I have my one-acts performance (meaning I still have to memorize half of my lines), also on thursday I have my PYWE concert, which I won't get home from until 11:00, then the next morning I ahve to be in portland at 8:30 for a parade which I will undoubtedly be too tired to march/play well in, and on top of all of that, exams are coming up and my English and History grades are still in the dumps.



On a totally different note:
I never talked about halloween, did i? Well, I went to abby's house after school. me, abby, amy hung around there for a while attempting bio homework and having difficulty answering 3rd Grade BrainQuest questions...then katie came and we walked to the Thai food place. Our route took us by NYA, and lo and behold! Jimmy was there! So we grabbed him and katie knight and went to eat dinner. After dinner, jimmy and katie left, and we four went ""trick or treating."" Although we only hit four or five house, we still got a fair amount of candy. Yeah. then we got back and watched rocky horror until 9:30. yeah...it was fun.

I have double study hall tomorrow. Why couldn't I have had it yesterday? or today would have been better. Last night I got home at 11:00 and was so astonishingly tired, I didn't do any homework. I tried eating lots of chocolate to caffeinate myself. But it didn't really work...and I don't drink coffee."

Today was quite possibly the worst day in school career. I had two tests, both of which went badly. The Geometry test was alright. the history test was awful. disgustingly awful. Apart from the tests, we had to present our Macbeth journal projects in English. And ours was horrible. Because Spencer and Ben wouldn't listen to me...well, that's not the only reason, but you get the idea.

After school I went to higgins and hung around with Jimmy in the chorus room. We had fun playing with the lights in the black box, and figuring out harmony to Simon and Garfunkel songs. Then he left. So I went into the band room. It was nice...because it was dark and there was nobody there. So i turned on some music and pondered life. And how it has taken a serious turn for the worse. then I played piano for a ridiculously long time...

Spent the afternoon in the art room...from 2:00-4:00. got part of my elements of design project finished, and made a pastel light bulb. which turned out kinda cool... It was really nice from 2:00-3:00. I came in, and there was nobody there. So I turned off the light and closed the door, and the only noises i could hear were the soothing pounding of the rain and the howling of the wind outside. I dunno. I really liked it like that. don't really know why. Anyway, then a group of juniors and some rowdy sophomore girls came in and it wasn't silent anymore. That was when i gave up on my project and made a light bulb.

Although there was the mic issue from time to time (when is there not?), and there were constantly people smoking and drinking all around us, and i saw nobody else I knew, it was still good. I hadn't expected them to be that good live! can't get over it. There are not words adequate to describe their amazing-ness. Yes, I'm stressing a point. But it really sucked because we had to leave early. They left stage and the lights went out, so we all thought it was over. Then they came out and said it was an intermission. At that point it was 10:00-they had been playing for two hours. But we had to leave at 10:15. Oh well.

Their opening act was amazing too. It was the Jazz Mandolin Project - Jimi Hendrix meets Miles Davis meets The Bad Plus...kinda...anywho, they were crazy. But it was funny because the trumpet/keyboard guy kept getting mad at the sound people and making gestures to them from onstage. hehe.

Just got back from Norlands. It was rather pointless on the whole. As it turns out, I was the only musician that showed up. It was rather embarassing, because i got to stand all by my lonesome in the back of the column, playing random cadences, and constantly looking up to find the camera man in my face. supposedly I'm now part of this PBS documentary on American history that's supposed to come out some time next year...And I got interviewed by the Sun Journal...that was kind of akward...the guy kept asking really random questions that had nothing to do with why i was there or what i was doing. and it was really annoying.

Chances are it had something to do with the fact that me and my partner had no time whatsoever to work together.

And lucky us, we're up against two of the smartest people in our class...So basically, I got fried. and I was dealt my first debate loss ever. You must realize that this is devastating. I want a rematch, but with more time to prepare, and a mock trial format instead of a straight-up debate...

You know, I thought I was doing really well in school until my history test and the debate came around. I hadn't had a single grade below a 90 in any subject. *sigh* C'est la vie.

Homecoming was friday and saturday. Friday night sucked. pretty much because of our live ""music,"" if it could be called that. Saturday was okay. We tied our game against scarburough (class A, undefeated), so that was good. I spent the rest of the day walking around and doing nothing because Abby and Amy completely ditched me. The dance was alright. Adrienne found me...although we only really half danced to one song. The rest of it was rather uneventful. Katie seemed to be having issues, my date kept running away to comfort her, Pete and Kessler danced as little as possible, and Abby's date was pretty much stoned (according to Abby, anyway)...It was interesting, to say the least.

After the dance, me, Abby, and Amy all went back to Abby's house. We proceeded to watch abby get drunk on mandrin seltzer water, watch veggie tales, and then watch our 8th grade slide show thingy. went home at 12:15. yeah."

Week as follows:
Saturday: Arrived, unpacked, settled in, (and as the King of Siam would say,) et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Sunday: Went into Rockland, went grocery shopping, checked out kayaks, came back. Got bored fast and engaged myself in several activities involving rocks.
Monday: Did pretty much nothing.
Tuesday: Ben came up and we spent the entire day on the beach having mud fights, swimming, etc. Ate at the Dip Net (best seafood restaurant EVER!) and then got ice cream at the Village Ice Cream Shop.
Wednesday: Went into Rockland again to the Farnsworth Art Museum.
Thursday: Spent most of the day kayaking. Went into Mosquito Harbor, then across the bay to Marshall Point. Had fun playing chicken with lobster boats.
Friday: Amy and Abby came up. We attempted to play poker, spoons, and something else, ate lunch. Went into village to get ice cream. Sat at the end of the dock for a while. Walked to light house, spent several hours there, went back to the house, at dinner, sat up in the loft for a long amount of time. Some interesting stuff happened up there... Not going to bother with details.
Saturday: Packed up, went home. Was miserable. Attempted to clean my room. Failed.

Right. It was nice though. And they closed BNAS. Which maketh me yea verily angry. Bah.

and, since I didn't post after my ohio trip, I shall do so now.

Ohio was plenty fun as well. The first night that we slept there, there was a huge thunderstorm that kept us all up past 1:00 am. Anywho. First week, we did pretty much nothing. On my birthday, we went to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame/Museum. That was a total blast. The feature exhibit was about the Who, which made me happy. Yeah. When we went to michigan, the real fun began. My dad's friend is the highest-raking american in the Daimler-Chrysler Corp., and he's super-rich. We stayed in his guest HOUSE, which was easily the size of a respectable house, and which contained a 51"" flat-screen TV. And a swimming pool. Luxurious, to say the least. Amazing, really. we also got a first hand view of his car collection, which contained a Lamborghini, '56 Mercedes, '98 Viper, and an original Mustang. Right. Anyway. while in michigan, we went to Greenfield Village (sort of a living history museum; It contains a great many famous buildings [The Wright Bicycle Shop, the original Ford Motors ""plant,"" the Firestone Farm, etc.]), and I discovered my dream [summer] job. So yeah. then we went back to Ohio, explored Amish country, went to a CivWar reenactment that sucked. But I bought a slouch hat that I like much. So dah!

"event","P.S. to the last entry:

MJC was a blast. at the end of the week a group of us got together, secured the finale spot, loosely rehearsed, then played Frank Zappa's ""Muffin Man"" on Friday night. It totally made my week. And I got cowbell. Yesssss!

Dammit, why aren't more people on IM at 11:30 pm?

I'm still awaiting a certain e-mail from a certain person (you know who you are). I am sorely missing conversation with this person, as well as with my other regular correspondant, who I have not heard from as of late either.

Oh well."

JrFDC + DRAM = Best week ever. Yeah. I had a total blast. Made many millions of new friends (I'm pretty sure I have more friends in New Jersey and Connecticut than I do in Maine now...), drummed, or in the words of my new language, musicked. Allow me to elaborate: One day, whilst bored in the drumline, me and my companion on the immediate right created a new language. The language does not yet have a name. A simple example of the language:

Fifer = Pfifer. Pfifers pfife.
Drummer = Musickian. Musickians musick.
Bass Drummer = Percusser. Percussers percuss.

But it does not stop there.

For example, I play drums, bass, piano, guitar, and vocals. Hence:
Me = Musickasianitarist.

It is a very complex language, and still in progress. someday I will publish the full dictionary.


Annnnnnnnyway. Back to F+D camp. The most fun I have ever had in a week. The social atmosphere was great, and despite all the time we spent musicking, pfifing, and percussing, there was still lots of time to hang out and stuff. Food could use some improvement though...

Right. In other news...

A quick ironic twist of events. Amy sent me a letter from AT. It came on monday. But I was at soccer camp on monday, as well as for the rest of the week, and I did not get it. I sent a letter to her the very same day from camp, not knowing that she had already sent me one. Strange, no?

In other other news...

I am reading Harry Potter. Knowing quite well that I may scar my pride, I like it. Grrr... Just Kidding, Rowling! haha. get it? J.K. Rowling? JK?? Get it? right. that was stupid. But I really do like it. Yeah.

I'm done.

I just came back from a trip to Blue Hill, which was fun. Abby was in Tommy (by the Who), so she invited me and her friend Mel (melissa) up to see it on Friday night. It was fun. after the performance we sat in Abby's grandparents' (in whose house we were staying) kitchen and talked and sang until 1:00 am. 'twere fun. I woke up at 7:00 for some strange reason. I guess I just can't sleep in... Anywho, we were supposed to go kayaking, but we didn't because it was pouring. so we spent saturday morning sitting around and talking, etc. So overall, it was pretty uneventful, but it was fun anyway.

I'm done now... I don't really want to go to sleep. I don't know why. I guess I'm just weird.



Oh yeah. SO EXCITED FOR DEEP RIVER!!!! except I still haven't memorized the standpiece *uh-oh!*..."

"event","I couldn't sleep last night. For some reason there were too many thoughts in my head...inescapable thoughts. About people. Anyway, I gave up trying at 4:00. I proceeded to get dressed, go downstairs, and take a looooooooong walk through the woods. and the beauty was indescribable. The fog was low and thick, only coming up to my waist, which procured a very eerie feeling. The air was cool and damp, and trees surrounded me on all sides. It was just such an amazingly peaceful feeling. Buuuuuut now I'm back. It's pretty obvious what I'm doing right now. And now, seeing as nobody else will be awake for the next three hours, I think I'll go paint a picture."

"event","Ok, i dunno why, but my brother's GF hates me...she talx bout me behind my back and just hates on me ALL THE TIME.I dunno why...I barely know this chick...she just hates me...
She's not the only 1...All these junior high kids hate me.I know...they are only middle school kids and i can soooo hurt them.I think i know why.This is my theory.When I was in 8th grade,I was dumb and dated a 7th grader for 3 and a half monthes.And I guess those ugly middle school girls think I'm a skank.I'm not, though. I was just being a dumb 8th grader.We didn't do anything and I learned from my mistakes...now I only date upper classmen.It's kinda my prefrence, I guess.
All I can say is this: Jay,you suck...Nancy....you suck too....and Erica...you're a skank and you're dating my brother.Screw the world."

  What I do not like about school sometimes is Phys.Ed.I don't mind running,cuz I played feild hockey,so its not a big deal.What I don't like is preps,jocks,and popular people getting in your face if you miss the volleyball.I mean,how gay is that?First of all,IT's JUST A GAME YOU STUPID PREPS!!!!Second of all,your life is not on the game.Preps,jox,and popular people,if you read this,PLEASE think about this.There is no need to get pissed just cuz you lost a dumb game.
         No,I am not goth.I'm not a prep either.Or a jock.I have no lbel and I like it that way,thank you."
